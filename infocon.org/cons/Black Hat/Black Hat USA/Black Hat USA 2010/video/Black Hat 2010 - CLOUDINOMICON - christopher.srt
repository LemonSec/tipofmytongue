1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,390
so I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> started my name is</font>

2
00:00:02,550 --> 00:00:08,730
Chris<font color="#CCCCCC"> Hoff and this thank you for coming</font>

3
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:10,620
this morning by ten o'clock I know I had

4
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:12,780
trouble showing up so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> appreciate the</font>

5
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:16,378
fact you got here at this early hour

6
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:18,630
this talk is<font color="#E5E5E5"> as you can tell about about</font>

7
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:20,820
cloud computing and specifically is

8
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:24,960
targeted towards security practitioners

9
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:27,480
who<font color="#CCCCCC"> are trying to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get a hold or a grasp</font>

10
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:30,090
on what they have to do differently

11
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:33,090
operationally architectural<font color="#E5E5E5"> e to</font>

12
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:36,120
understand what cloud computing is going

13
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:38,550
to do to<font color="#E5E5E5"> what it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is they do is part of</font>

14
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:39,899
the daily lives so you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

15
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:43,199
interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> notion here is that when you</font>

16
00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:45,719
talk about cloud and we look at where

17
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:48,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's evolved from we we hear an awful</font>

18
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:49,980
lot of discussions about what<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

19
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:52,440
the mainframe models and where cloud

20
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:53,819
arose from how it's you know how

21
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:55,649
ultimately it's fundamentally new

22
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:59,550
technology some argue it's you know it's

23
00:00:55,649 --> 00:01:02,070
not what's interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> about it is the</font>

24
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:04,679
elements associated with what what cloud

25
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:06,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">computing means to security is is wide</font>

26
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:07,680
and varied depending upon which models

27
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:10,350
what you mean by cloud computing so

28
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:11,369
we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about a whole bunch</font>

29
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:13,530
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in this talk</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and it's really</font>

30
00:01:11,369 --> 00:01:16,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">one of my kind of infotainment firehose</font>

31
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:18,270
talks there's a ton of content that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

32
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:19,770
on these<font color="#E5E5E5"> slides all kind of highlight</font>

33
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:21,929
what's on the slides you'll have them

34
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:24,750
available<font color="#E5E5E5"> to you they generally end up</font>

35
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:25,920
being pretty decent reference points the

36
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:27,750
three things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we're really going to</font>

37
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:28,740
focus on here are<font color="#E5E5E5"> are in bold we're</font>

38
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:30,119
going to talk about idempotent

39
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:32,429
infrastructure as it relates<font color="#CCCCCC"> to public</font>

40
00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:33,299
infrastructure to cloud services and

41
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:34,799
<font color="#CCCCCC">I'll explain what item potent</font>

42
00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:36,450
infrastructure means in more detail but

43
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:38,340
if you start thinking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about sameness of</font>

44
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:39,450
infrastructure homogeneity from the

45
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:40,890
perspective of being<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to scale</font>

46
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:42,899
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> what that's going to focus on</font>

47
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:44,310
we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about revisiting a</font>

48
00:01:42,899 --> 00:01:46,320
concept called survivability or

49
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:48,060
information survivability as well as

50
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:49,320
information centricity and these three

51
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:51,600
things will kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of make more sense as</font>

52
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:53,579
we go along and discuss how cloud

53
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:56,490
computing<font color="#E5E5E5"> is really bringing back a lot</font>

54
00:01:53,579 --> 00:01:58,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">of concepts that in many cases we've I</font>

55
00:01:56,490 --> 00:02:00,990
don't say abandoned but we've kind of

56
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:02,880
forgotten so we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to talk about</font>

57
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:05,219
<font color="#E5E5E5">the fact that not all public</font>

58
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:08,280
infrastructure service providers and

59
00:02:05,219 --> 00:02:10,530
services are created equal and not

60
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:11,489
they're not<font color="#CCCCCC"> all really focused or</font>

61
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:13,590
targeted the same type of customer

62
00:02:11,489 --> 00:02:15,720
either and really<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's</font>

63
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:17,400
differentiation going on based on the

64
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:18,780
types of networking connectivity

65
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:20,310
security and a whole<font color="#CCCCCC"> bunch of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font>

66
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:22,019
<font color="#CCCCCC">that ultimately make a big difference</font>

67
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:22,920
between one infrastructure to service

68
00:02:22,019 --> 00:02:24,450
cloud provider let's say at a

69
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:26,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">mass-market scale versus one that</font>

70
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:28,079
specializes in certain niches we're

71
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:30,238
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about the fact that public</font>

72
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:33,060
infrastructure to cloud services can

73
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:34,590
absolutely allow you to take an

74
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:36,840
application today they'll engineer at in

75
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:41,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">your enterprise and be deployed just as</font>

76
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:42,840
securely or even more so than then what

77
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:45,870
you do today that's that's a tough thing

78
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:46,980
to get your<font color="#E5E5E5"> arm around however</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

79
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:48,870
needs to be paired with<font color="#E5E5E5"> a sentence that</font>

80
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:50,340
if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> are willing to fundamentally we</font>

81
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:51,870
architects your applications your

82
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:53,160
infrastructure your operations your

83
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:55,349
organization<font color="#E5E5E5"> and how much money you</font>

84
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:56,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">spend where why and how then that</font>

85
00:02:55,349 --> 00:02:59,819
statement holds true so we're going to

86
00:02:56,910 --> 00:03:01,019
talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that ultimately it really is</font>

87
00:02:59,819 --> 00:03:02,700
time<font color="#E5E5E5"> to kind of get the bell bottoms out</font>

88
00:03:01,019 --> 00:03:05,010
of the closet like every 15 years stuff

89
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:06,359
comes back into popularity and this is

90
00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:08,160
one of those things we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to see a</font>

91
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:10,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">whole lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of applicability of stuff that</font>

92
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:12,569
has lingered around for a while but was

93
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:14,160
solutions looking for problems today we

94
00:03:12,569 --> 00:03:15,958
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> those problems and speaking of that</font>

95
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:17,880
this is really kind of one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a series</font>

96
00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:20,639
one that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of the fourth in the</font>

97
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:21,480
series i started i started this with my

98
00:03:20,639 --> 00:03:23,489
four horsemen of the virtualization

99
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:25,048
security apocalypse talk which talked

100
00:03:23,489 --> 00:03:26,670
about how<font color="#E5E5E5"> virtualization was really</font>

101
00:03:25,049 --> 00:03:29,190
impacting networking and security that

102
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:31,108
<font color="#CCCCCC">went on to this the frogs who desired a</font>

103
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:33,599
king talk which really kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of out lied</font>

104
00:03:31,109 --> 00:03:35,489
or outlined the<font color="#CCCCCC"> high level kind of</font>

105
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:37,290
30,000 foot view issues associated with

106
00:03:35,489 --> 00:03:39,359
how cloud was fundamentally changing

107
00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:41,130
what we<font color="#E5E5E5"> did in security and then the</font>

108
00:03:39,359 --> 00:03:43,799
cloud of fornication talk which was

109
00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:45,599
really highlighting how infrastructure

110
00:03:43,799 --> 00:03:47,609
kind of hot cloud on cloud action how

111
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:49,078
essentially<font color="#E5E5E5"> you were getting cloud based</font>

112
00:03:47,609 --> 00:03:51,000
on clouds based on clouds with

113
00:03:49,079 --> 00:03:53,340
staggering amounts of independency so

114
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,989
this last one is really<font color="#E5E5E5"> more about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

115
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:56,549
we know what the problems are what can

116
00:03:54,989 --> 00:03:57,930
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> do about them where are we trending</font>

117
00:03:56,549 --> 00:03:59,609
in terms of infrastructure as a service

118
00:03:57,930 --> 00:04:01,620
while we have platform as a service in

119
00:03:59,609 --> 00:04:04,139
software is a service also<font color="#CCCCCC"> I find that</font>

120
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:05,519
<font color="#E5E5E5">in many cases people are really trying</font>

121
00:04:04,139 --> 00:04:06,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">to grapple with what the differences are</font>

122
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:07,739
between infrastructures our service and

123
00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:09,780
what they do in the enterprise<font color="#E5E5E5"> today so</font>

124
00:04:07,739 --> 00:04:12,480
we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to focus on that so like</font>

125
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:15,540
most good things in life you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can blame</font>

126
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:17,789
the French<font color="#CCCCCC"> get food and wine and other</font>

127
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:19,289
things but the point here<font color="#E5E5E5"> is I like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

128
00:04:17,789 --> 00:04:21,418
make an analogy to<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of stick</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

129
00:04:19,289 --> 00:04:23,669
people and maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> this one will maybe it</font>

130
00:04:21,418 --> 00:04:26,760
won't but for me I<font color="#E5E5E5"> really like a siege</font>

131
00:04:23,669 --> 00:04:27,180
warfare and I love kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> being a</font>

132
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:30,870
history

133
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:32,190
of military and so being a history buff

134
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:34,139
from the<font color="#CCCCCC"> military and so from the</font>

135
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:36,270
perspective of what<font color="#E5E5E5"> a siege</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> warfare and</font>

136
00:04:34,139 --> 00:04:40,289
why this relates the trebuchet was

137
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:43,258
really interesting um evolution of a set

138
00:04:40,289 --> 00:04:45,120
of capabilities for siege warfare that I

139
00:04:43,259 --> 00:04:47,039
find very interesting you had actually

140
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:48,690
not the<font color="#CCCCCC"> French to blame initially but</font>

141
00:04:47,039 --> 00:04:50,159
the French and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Greeks and Romans who</font>

142
00:04:48,690 --> 00:04:52,110
also stole some stuff from other people

143
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:54,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">but you had stuff like the catapult a</font>

144
00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:56,729
pretty simple mechanical fulcrum arm and

145
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:59,009
the ballista which just launched these

146
00:04:56,729 --> 00:05:00,599

147
00:04:59,009 --> 00:05:02,039
trebuchet came<font color="#E5E5E5"> online with this kind of</font>

148
00:05:00,599 --> 00:05:03,750
really interesting counter-balance

00:05:02,039 --> 00:05:04,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">weight and this sling what was</font>

150
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:07,080
interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> about it was the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> French</font>

151
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:08,430
introduces around the 12th century and

152
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:10,560
it and what they really<font color="#E5E5E5"> did was just</font>

153
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:12,930
better the concepts associated with what

154
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:15,840
they saw<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the balista and the catapult</font>

155
00:05:12,930 --> 00:05:18,000
so as<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mentioned the trebuchet that</font>

156
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:19,169
thing on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Left utilized this sling</font>

157
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,360
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> counterbalanced armed with a</font>

158
00:05:19,169 --> 00:05:23,849
weight and it could basically doubled

159
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:26,190
the throwing throwing power of the

160
00:05:23,849 --> 00:05:28,050
engine that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you could</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> use to hoist hoist</font>

161
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:29,490
projectiles so catapults are really

162
00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:31,470
efficient you could use them to kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

163
00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:33,060
lob things like a 50 60 pounds a couple

164
00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:34,919
<font color="#CCCCCC">hundred feet but what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you found with the</font>

165
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:37,560
trebuchet is you can throw objects like

166
00:05:34,919 --> 00:05:38,880
300<font color="#CCCCCC"> pounds several hundred feet</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

167
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:41,220
instead<font color="#E5E5E5"> of making like little Dinks in</font>

168
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:42,599
in the side of a<font color="#E5E5E5"> castle and kind of</font>

169
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:44,849
chipping away at it you could knock down

170
00:05:42,599 --> 00:05:47,219
entire walls right which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is which is a</font>

171
00:05:44,849 --> 00:05:48,389
very very interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> tipping point from</font>

172
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:50,909
the perspective of what<font color="#CCCCCC"> siege warfare</font>

173
00:05:48,389 --> 00:05:53,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">and battle warfare and battlements had</font>

174
00:05:50,909 --> 00:05:55,080
to deal with<font color="#E5E5E5"> so what that really</font>

175
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:57,270
amounted to was a really a better

176
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:59,550
mousetrap but a much more operationally

177
00:05:57,270 --> 00:06:01,500
complex model to deal with and I say

178
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:03,210
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> because if you look at kind of how</font>

179
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:05,220
this thing is constructed you had to

180
00:06:03,210 --> 00:06:07,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">have an</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> understanding of a great deal</font>

181
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:09,180
more of physics and physical science to

182
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:10,740
pull this thing off it was really<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

183
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:12,810
marriage<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a lot of other previous</font>

184
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:14,759
catapult designs but with better physics

185
00:06:12,810 --> 00:06:17,669
and better applied a physical science

186
00:06:14,759 --> 00:06:19,080
and it works on a<font color="#E5E5E5"> simple principle but</font>

187
00:06:17,669 --> 00:06:20,520
ultimately there was absolutely nothing

188
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:22,500
simple about getting one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the things</font>

189
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:24,419
set up making it work making it work

190
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:27,180
efficiently and in fact when things

191
00:06:24,419 --> 00:06:29,370
didn't work efficiently it was it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

192
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:31,919
horrific so precision was a very

193
00:06:29,370 --> 00:06:33,449
important<font color="#E5E5E5"> part about about about the</font>

194
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:34,530
trebuchet and more interesting enough

195
00:06:33,449 --> 00:06:36,870
what does this have to do with cloud

196
00:06:34,530 --> 00:06:38,130
what strength enough it was kind of when

197
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:39,960
you look at the trebuchet it was an

198
00:06:38,130 --> 00:06:40,780
evolutionary application of some

199
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:43,810
revolutionary idea

200
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:45,820
is like gravity right it caused<font color="#E5E5E5"> quite a</font>

201
00:06:43,810 --> 00:06:47,020
stir a whole shell shift in strategy no

202
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:48,280
longer<font color="#E5E5E5"> could you just expect that your</font>

203
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:50,590
castle was going to stand there and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

204
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:52,929
<font color="#E5E5E5">could would you know with a you could</font>

205
00:06:50,590 --> 00:06:54,609
withstand bombardment it really laid the

206
00:06:52,930 --> 00:06:57,280
foundation for a whole<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot more of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

207
00:06:54,610 --> 00:07:01,419
mechanized<font color="#E5E5E5"> sets of siege warfare</font>

208
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:04,119
applications and even more innovation in

209
00:07:01,419 --> 00:07:06,159
battlefield in the battlefield<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

210
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:07,000
basically it was<font color="#CCCCCC"> the precursor to a lot</font>

211
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,530
of how<font color="#CCCCCC"> people were thinking about</font>

212
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,240
battlefield automation and what a

213
00:07:08,530 --> 00:07:12,280
defender<font color="#E5E5E5"> would also have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do to deal</font>

214
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:13,600
with this so when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> think about kind</font>

215
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:15,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">of the progression there as an analogy</font>

216
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:18,520
which I find useful in talks like this

217
00:07:15,910 --> 00:07:21,070
there was a set of studies in the late

218
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:23,080
80s Early 90s from Carnegie Mellon that

219
00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:25,719
was funded<font color="#CCCCCC"> by DARPA that was called the</font>

220
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:27,700
information survivability and it talked

221
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:30,400
about a<font color="#E5E5E5"> bunch of shifts and these shifts</font>

222
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:32,260
if you think of<font color="#CCCCCC"> in 2000-2001</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and you</font>

223
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:33,820
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> where we are now in 2010 it</font>

224
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:35,650
may not<font color="#E5E5E5"> seem</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like an awful lot of time</font>

225
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:37,719
but these these shifts were<font color="#E5E5E5"> were pretty</font>

226
00:07:35,650 --> 00:07:40,419
<font color="#E5E5E5">recent they were they were amazingly</font>

227
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:42,520
accurate and very interesting when we

228
00:07:40,419 --> 00:07:44,020
look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at how IT if you kind of compare</font>

229
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:45,909
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> analogy to the trebuchet is also</font>

230
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:47,500
progressed so what they said was there

231
00:07:45,910 --> 00:07:49,240
were seven shifts that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> ultimately</font>

232
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:52,450
were moving from<font color="#CCCCCC"> a very centralized to</font>

233
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:53,620
globalized way of interacting both from

234
00:07:52,450 --> 00:07:55,000
an IT perspective and way of doing

235
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:57,700
business they talked<font color="#CCCCCC"> about going from</font>

236
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:00,940
bounded to unbounded ultimately from

237
00:07:57,700 --> 00:08:03,190
insular to networked from predictable in

238
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:05,830
terms of events and timelines<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

239
00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:08,050
asynchronous right from single to shared

240
00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:10,210
responsibility from<font color="#E5E5E5"> overhead to</font>

241
00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:12,039
essential right from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the way in which</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

242
00:08:10,210 --> 00:08:14,500
are perceived in terms of IT security

243
00:08:12,039 --> 00:08:16,060
those sorts of things from security to

244
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:18,010
survivability and I'll highlight what

245
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:19,750
that means a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit later but it</font>

246
00:08:18,010 --> 00:08:21,039
really is a is a little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a</font>

247
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:23,260
wholesale shift in terms<font color="#E5E5E5"> of how you</font>

248
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:24,789
think about<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and ultimately I</font>

249
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:26,500
added two more on to this these weren't

250
00:08:24,789 --> 00:08:28,990
in the original seven but from static to

251
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:30,370
dynamic and from manual to automated so

252
00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:31,479
if you think<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you look at where we</font>

253
00:08:30,370 --> 00:08:33,370
are with virtualization look at what we

254
00:08:31,479 --> 00:08:36,880
were cloud computing these shifts have

255
00:08:33,370 --> 00:08:38,530
really exactly manifested themselves in

256
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:40,870
the way that that<font color="#CCCCCC"> Carnegie Mellon talked</font>

257
00:08:38,530 --> 00:08:43,000
about was going to happen about 10 years

258
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:45,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">ago so what's actually happened is we've</font>

259
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:48,640
moved and consolidated from servers to

260
00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:50,229
pools or of of resources in terms of the

261
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:52,839
compute layer networking<font color="#E5E5E5"> storage has</font>

262
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:54,170
moved from dedicated a local attached

263
00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:56,180
storage and and

264
00:08:54,170 --> 00:08:58,880
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> disc</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> two clusters and fabrics both</font>

265
00:08:56,180 --> 00:09:00,319
in hardware and in software ultimately

266
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:02,480
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have escaped from this kind of</font>

267
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:04,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">tightly coupled set of applications and</font>

268
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:06,680
infrastructure to a distributed

269
00:09:04,430 --> 00:09:08,060
computing model that really makes makes

270
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:09,529
a fundamental shift in the way in<font color="#E5E5E5"> which</font>

271
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:11,268
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> think about both application</font>

272
00:09:09,529 --> 00:09:12,889
deployment and security and ultimately

273
00:09:11,269 --> 00:09:14,510
transition from infrastructure<font color="#E5E5E5"> to this</font>

274
00:09:12,889 --> 00:09:16,310
notion of composable service layers and

275
00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:18,410
these things<font color="#E5E5E5"> are interesting from cloud</font>

276
00:09:16,310 --> 00:09:20,540
because if you look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at what this is if</font>

277
00:09:18,410 --> 00:09:21,589
you look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at these changes</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and you think</font>

278
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:23,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">about where we are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> from the security</font>

279
00:09:21,589 --> 00:09:26,149
industry perspective we really have not

280
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:28,160
addressed these moves at all<font color="#E5E5E5"> or at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> least</font>

281
00:09:26,149 --> 00:09:30,380
not very<font color="#CCCCCC"> well right so when</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you think</font>

282
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:31,519
<font color="#CCCCCC">about public cloud again it's very</font>

283
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:32,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">important</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think about the fact that</font>

284
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:35,510
not all public clouds are created equal

285
00:09:32,899 --> 00:09:37,730
or for the same purpose that really what

286
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:40,430
it talks about is in most people's eyes

287
00:09:37,730 --> 00:09:42,079
is scale that is enabled<font color="#CCCCCC"> by abstracted</font>

288
00:09:40,430 --> 00:09:45,859
and item potent infrastructure meaning

289
00:09:42,079 --> 00:09:47,630
homogeneity with lots and lots of it so

290
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:49,790
massive data centers with hundreds of

291
00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:52,220
thousands of cores a huge storage and a

292
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:54,469
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of bandwidth ultimately and</font>

293
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:56,630
extremely agile heavily virtualized and

294
00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:58,579
and for the most<font color="#E5E5E5"> part mostly completely</font>

295
00:09:56,630 --> 00:10:00,350
automated and hugely software driven

296
00:09:58,579 --> 00:10:02,239
which is not really<font color="#CCCCCC"> how we thought of</font>

297
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:04,880
our data centers five years ago

298
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:06,529
ultimately also the way in<font color="#E5E5E5"> which we</font>

299
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:08,449
manage and interact with these stacks is

300
00:10:06,529 --> 00:10:09,949
almost now moving exclusively to an<font color="#CCCCCC"> API</font>

301
00:10:08,449 --> 00:10:12,140
model which means you don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

302
00:10:09,949 --> 00:10:13,250
standalone apps you you can spin<font color="#CCCCCC"> up and</font>

303
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:16,339
control the entire infrastructure

304
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:18,290
programmatically which is very<font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font>

305
00:10:16,339 --> 00:10:20,600
interesting so when we think<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

306
00:10:18,290 --> 00:10:22,219
public cloud it is important to kind of

307
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:23,870
think about<font color="#CCCCCC"> the enterprise version</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of it</font>

308
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:25,880
just for dimension to compare and

309
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:27,440
contrast so if we<font color="#CCCCCC"> think about a private</font>

310
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:29,089
cloud or enterprise infrastructure to

311
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:30,980
service it really<font color="#E5E5E5"> is there to leverage</font>

312
00:10:29,089 --> 00:10:32,839
virtualization right and basically

313
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:35,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">squeeze efficiency automation better</font>

314
00:10:32,839 --> 00:10:36,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">self-service those sorts of things it's</font>

315
00:10:35,029 --> 00:10:38,540
really focused<font color="#E5E5E5"> on security</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

316
00:10:36,410 --> 00:10:40,399
compliance for the most part as one big

317
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:41,839
reason to keep it internally and the

318
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:43,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">infrastructure is still exposed in many</font>

319
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:46,339
cases to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the IT teams they can store you</font>

321
00:10:46,339 --> 00:10:50,480
really<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the general preservation of</font>

322
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:52,880
existing architecture and infrastructure

00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:54,560

325
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:57,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">different but the whole point is really</font>

326
00:10:55,970 --> 00:10:58,910
it's not really business as usual but

327
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:00,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">the fundamental operational practices</font>

328
00:10:58,910 --> 00:11:03,740
associated how an enterprise manages

329
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:05,599
this stuff is really very similar public

330
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:07,760
cloud on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> other side is a fundamental</font>

00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:10,880
riorca texture of application

332
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:12,650
security compliance pretty much

333
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:14,540
everything<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we talked about in</font>

334
00:11:12,650 --> 00:11:16,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">public cloud is about massive amounts of</font>

335
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:18,709
abstraction we need to isolate and hide

336
00:11:16,730 --> 00:11:19,610
the moving parts from you so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can get</font>

337
00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:21,800
on with actually running the<font color="#E5E5E5"> business</font>

338
00:11:19,610 --> 00:11:23,360
instead of building the business what's

339
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:25,729
interesting here is it focuses on scale

340
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:26,870
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> lower</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> costs homogenate the</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">most part primarily software enabled or</font>

343
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:33,199
software focused so when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> think about</font>

344
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:34,849
public cloud what this really means is

345
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:36,260
all about gracefully giving up direct

346
00:11:34,850 --> 00:11:38,330
operational control<font color="#CCCCCC"> over infrastructure</font>

347
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:39,590
which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> something most people are very</font>

348
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:40,670
very uncomfortable with especially

349
00:11:39,590 --> 00:11:42,290
security people because if you can't

350
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:43,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">touch it feel it don't understand how it</font>

351
00:11:42,290 --> 00:11:46,130
works don't have visibility transparency

352
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:48,080
we can't do a good job of securing it so

353
00:11:46,130 --> 00:11:50,660
therein lies<font color="#CCCCCC"> the problem</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right what we</font>

354
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:54,800
have in public cloud is this large set

355
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:56,600
of essentially heterogeneous monoculture

356
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:59,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">of both operating</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> system and hardware</font>

357
00:11:56,600 --> 00:12:00,350

the<font color="#CCCCCC"> business to fit the software right</font>

364
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:11,630
you had fundamental shifts in the way

365
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:12,620
you were supposed to operate your

366

business now that wasn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> a sara lee a</font>

368
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:18,860
challenges associated with what was

369
00:12:16,730 --> 00:12:20,240
assumed we were supposed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do from a</font>

security perspective to manage this

371
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:25,340
stuff so these shifts when we think

372
00:12:22,970 --> 00:12:26,810
about how we've dealt with the security

373
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:28,490
models of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the past attack origin</font>

defensive strategy approach how we

00:12:28,490 --> 00:12:31,850
manage identity how we deploy

376
00:12:29,690 --> 00:12:33,830
applications how hardware and software

377
00:12:31,850 --> 00:12:36,350
resources<font color="#CCCCCC"> commingle and where our data</font>

00:12:36,350 --> 00:12:40,010
time line to the present and ultimately

380
00:12:38,270 --> 00:12:42,439
the future with this notion of

381
00:12:40,010 --> 00:12:44,540
ubiquitous cyber terror and the fact

382
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:45,470
that we have repolarization everything

about how security has shifted to deal

with this to this<font color="#E5E5E5"> model of survivability</font>

you have to make the<font color="#E5E5E5"> systems very</font>

396

resilient and it has to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be holistically</font>

397
00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:16,310
of architected ultimately depends on the

398
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:18,290
ability of these network systems to

399
00:13:16,310 --> 00:13:19,969
provide continuity even if the service

400
00:13:18,290 --> 00:13:21,110
levels are degraded it requires that

401
00:13:19,970 --> 00:13:22,730
that only you

402
00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:25,670
you protect only the critical assets

403
00:13:22,730 --> 00:13:27,170

00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:37,939
know it should be no no surprise<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

439
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:41,029
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of we've got this case of</font>

security<font color="#E5E5E5"> a DD the threat model velocity</font>

00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:45,589
attacker far outpaces the defender we've

443
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:48,560
heard<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the general said that this</font>

morning by design security doesn't

445
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:51,920
really scale very well right it assumes

446
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:52,969
there's going to be some human being or

447
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:55,219
some level<font color="#E5E5E5"> of intelligence or</font>

448
00:14:52,970 --> 00:14:58,790

449
00:14:55,220 --> 00:15:00,380
doesn't really work we don't almost by

451
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:02,990

452
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:05,839
think about moving to infrastructure

453
00:15:02,990 --> 00:15:07,430
there's completely automated it's really

454
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:09,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">not about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> defense-in-depth anymore it's</font>

455
00:15:07,430 --> 00:15:11,089
about defense in width like we just

456
00:15:09,050 --> 00:15:12,769
spray so much crap on a stack and hope

that ultimately<font color="#E5E5E5"> it is going to be</font>

from the mainframe model where stuff was

very centralized ultimately reasonably

consistently we have done<font color="#CCCCCC"> a excellent</font>

job of providing you one of these which

doesn't solve any<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the actual</font>

486
00:16:11,029 --> 00:16:15,139
for that and that reason is called the

489
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:20,720
use this<font color="#E5E5E5"> because it actually explains</font>

491
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:24,050
the Left axis you basically have how we

492
00:16:22,370 --> 00:16:25,639
invest and where we deploy from a

493
00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:27,290
security perspective and we kind of

494
00:16:25,639 --> 00:16:29,060
flip-flop between<font color="#E5E5E5"> host-based and</font>

network-based centricity for therefore

00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:34,550
our solution sets almost constantly over

497
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:35,870
time right so what happens is you know

498
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:37,399
you can pick an arbitrary point in time

499
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:38,839
on the sine wave it's actually much more

500
00:16:37,399 --> 00:16:40,279
bursty but it's moved and ribbed for

501

<font color="#E5E5E5">start up host right we deploy an agent</font>

503
00:16:42,199 --> 00:16:46,819
then we deploy 27 agents one per thread

504
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:48,439
then we<font color="#CCCCCC"> converge those into a mega agent</font>

505
00:16:46,819 --> 00:16:51,229
that takes up eighty-six percent of the

506
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:53,269
CPU utilization and 14.7 gigs of memory

507
00:16:51,230 --> 00:16:54,589
we say you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this isn't working</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so we</font>

508
00:16:53,269 --> 00:16:56,360
say what we need to do is<font color="#E5E5E5"> focus on the</font>

509
00:16:54,589 --> 00:16:58,790

laughs and things break heuristically

513
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:05,000
and we don't know why<font color="#E5E5E5"> because the</font>

514
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:06,260
developers are completely disconnected

<font color="#CCCCCC">from the security teams and the</font>

516
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:09,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">infrastructure teams so we say you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

what will focus on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> information will</font>

518
00:17:09,530 --> 00:17:13,790
just protect it oh where is it<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

00:17:12,109 --> 00:17:15,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">everywhere I don't know you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know I have</font>

521
00:17:15,829 --> 00:17:18,829
around the information so we'll move

522
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:20,449
will protect things<font color="#E5E5E5"> by focusing on the</font>

user will stop the monkeys from pushing

00:17:20,449 --> 00:17:24,350
the wrong buttons and that doesn't work

525
00:17:23,209 --> 00:17:26,209
because people give up password for

526
00:17:24,349 --> 00:17:28,580
chocolate bars so then we say<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

527
00:17:26,209 --> 00:17:30,169
speeds and feeds are awesome we'll do<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

528
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:31,939
in the network except we've encrypted

529
00:17:30,169 --> 00:17:33,200
all the data so now<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can't gain</font>

visibility without man in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> middle</font>

531
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:36,559
which breaks the applications and the

532
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:39,440
users and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> information so it goes on</font>

and<font color="#E5E5E5"> on and on and to make it worse if I</font>

or new technology like cloud or

537
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:48,799
virtualization what you find is our

538
00:17:47,299 --> 00:17:49,310
deployment methodology is focused up

539
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:51,500
here

540
00:17:49,310 --> 00:17:52,879
we're the actual use case for deployment

541
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:54,350
aware of what you're actually able to

542
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:56,240
deploy from a compensated control is

543
00:17:54,350 --> 00:17:57,620
down here what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean by</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is if you</font>

544
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,520
look at mass-market public cloud

545
00:17:57,620 --> 00:18:00,679
providers where the network is

546
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:03,350
abstracted I don't have access to the

547
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:04,880
network or its entire basis for what it

548
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:06,980
looks like and where it is completely

549
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:08,510
changes so I can't deploy a compensating

550
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:10,190
control the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same way so I deploying my</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">guest right so now I'm installing</font>

553
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:16,970
it it potentially<font color="#E5E5E5"> hundreds of thousands</font>

554
00:18:14,390 --> 00:18:19,490
of endpoints that automatically scale so

555
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:21,800
what's interesting is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that differential</font>

556
00:18:19,490 --> 00:18:24,740
180 degree out of phase is hugely

557
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:26,540
problematic right but we flip-flop this

558
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:28,850
way and we the stuff in the middle<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

559
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:30,500
information sent centric part is where

560
00:18:28,850 --> 00:18:33,590
we really ought to<font color="#CCCCCC"> focus but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we never</font>

561
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:35,210
actually get time to do that so when we

562
00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:37,189
look at this<font color="#CCCCCC"> problem set and we look at</font>

563
00:18:35,210 --> 00:18:38,750
the stacks on the left I like two

564
00:18:37,190 --> 00:18:41,450
separate things into three chunks and I

565
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:42,860
did I bought<font color="#E5E5E5"> this up as a model in in</font>

566
00:18:41,450 --> 00:18:44,270
the cloud of fornication talk and I'm

567
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:45,560
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do it again here I like to</font>

568
00:18:44,270 --> 00:18:46,850
break things down into three chunks

569
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:48,230

572

data metadata and in the middle is

573
00:18:53,030 --> 00:18:57,020
metastructure which is glue and guts

574

protocols in a non virtualized non cloud

575
00:18:57,020 --> 00:19:00,500
world metastructure is supposed to bind

576
00:18:59,150 --> 00:19:02,000
or provide affinity between the

infrastructure and<font color="#CCCCCC"> applications sticks</font>

578

them together that's the old world model

monolithic apps in virtualization or

580
00:19:06,050 --> 00:19:08,899
cloud that middle layer nearly

581
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:11,210
ultimately if you introduce

582
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:13,130
virtualization in any concept or

583
00:19:11,210 --> 00:19:15,440
abstraction is supposed to separate or

584
00:19:13,130 --> 00:19:17,570
provide basically a a fluid layer

585
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:18,800
between the two so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they don't they</font>

586
00:19:17,570 --> 00:19:20,960
are<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually not statically bound</font>

587
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:23,120
they're separated the problem is all<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

588
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:25,010
infrastructure stuff that is used to

589
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:26,899
interfacing with protocols that are very

590
00:19:25,010 --> 00:19:28,010
stale and<font color="#CCCCCC"> Static completely break this</font>

591
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:29,930
model when we start to introduce

592
00:19:28,010 --> 00:19:32,180
mobility of workloads of data of

593
00:19:29,930 --> 00:19:33,920
information right so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> notion of</font>

594
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:35,690
automation is really really screwy

595
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:37,130
especially<font color="#E5E5E5"> when you pair it with the</font>

596
00:19:35,690 --> 00:19:38,510
fact that in public cloud providers

597
00:19:37,130 --> 00:19:40,490
they're building this notion of

598
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:42,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">idempotent infrastructure we're hardware</font>

599
00:19:40,490 --> 00:19:44,570
for example and the software blends into

600
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:46,970
this amorphous blob that abstracts

601
00:19:44,570 --> 00:19:48,470
capabilities prevents you essentially

602
00:19:46,970 --> 00:19:50,000
presents you with certain layers and

603
00:19:48,470 --> 00:19:51,230
ways of interacting with the stack but

604
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,450
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know what they're you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know how</font>

605
00:19:51,230 --> 00:19:54,890
they're composed and so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> didn't potent</font>

606
00:19:53,450 --> 00:19:57,560
infrastructure is very interesting

607
00:19:54,890 --> 00:19:59,870
because it Maps back to the root part of

608
00:19:57,560 --> 00:20:01,970
how our practices have to change in the

609
00:19:59,870 --> 00:20:02,929
security world so when everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> looks</font>

610
00:20:01,970 --> 00:20:05,570
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> same</font>

611
00:20:02,930 --> 00:20:06,920
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's both awesome and horrific at</font>

612
00:20:05,570 --> 00:20:09,080
the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> time and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we're going to talk</font>

613
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:10,940
about this so idempotent basically is a

614
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:12,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">computer science mathematics earth at</font>

615
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:14,570
means essentially once i deploy you know

616
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:17,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">III have one system when i deploy</font>

617
00:20:14,570 --> 00:20:20,810
multiple of them<font color="#E5E5E5"> i essentially can</font>

618
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:23,060
affect an issue of<font color="#E5E5E5"> scale without change</font>

619
00:20:20,810 --> 00:20:24,169
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm essentially able to i mean that</font>

620
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:25,669
you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> call</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> them</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> multiple times and it</font>

621
00:20:24,170 --> 00:20:26,840
has the same result<font color="#CCCCCC"> so when you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

622
00:20:25,670 --> 00:20:28,340
about infrastructure here as it relates

623
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:30,470
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> cloud it means i can spin up an image</font>

624
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:32,689
or a hundred<font color="#CCCCCC"> of them and essentially</font>

625
00:20:30,470 --> 00:20:34,250
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> i do is just serve you know more</font>

626
00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:36,290
and better by<font color="#E5E5E5"> a greater</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> amounts of</font>

627
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:38,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">volume so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> idempotent infrastructure is</font>

628
00:20:36,290 --> 00:20:41,360
interesting because when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think about</font>

629
00:20:38,090 --> 00:20:42,800
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and cloud the matrix is a great</font>

630
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:44,510
example with agent smith right just keep

631
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:47,540
multiplying all the skill sets are the

632
00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:49,520
same<font color="#CCCCCC"> but there's just more of it ah this</font>

633
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:51,649
notion is that homogeneity here provides

634
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:53,750
the ability to scale out right which is

635
00:20:51,650 --> 00:20:55,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">something if you have the illusion of</font>

636
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:57,140
infinite scale is awesome because you

637
00:20:55,310 --> 00:20:59,899
can essentially if you have that need

638
00:20:57,140 --> 00:21:02,390
continue to roll out more resources it

639
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:04,280
does<font color="#E5E5E5"> not always imply commodity hardware</font>

640
00:21:02,390 --> 00:21:06,290
however<font color="#CCCCCC"> i told you that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in the beginning</font>

641
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:09,500
there's very much a difference<font color="#E5E5E5"> between</font>

642
00:21:06,290 --> 00:21:12,200
one extreme on the on the on the company

643
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:14,720
scale of of what public cloud providers

644
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:16,040
can can do an offer and on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> other end</font>

645
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:18,500
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that differentiate and</font>

646
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:20,480
focus on a<font color="#CCCCCC"> different set of problems so</font>

647
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:21,890
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> one side</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you could use commodity</font>

648
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:23,720
hardware on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the other on the other side</font>

649
00:21:21,890 --> 00:21:25,460
you could use a best-of-breed it does

650
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:27,590
not always imply commodity hardware to

651
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:29,570
get item potent infrastructure it really

652
00:21:27,590 --> 00:21:31,159
is there<font color="#E5E5E5"> to maximize density and</font>

653
00:21:29,570 --> 00:21:34,129
modularity of resources so i can<font color="#E5E5E5"> quickly</font>

654
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:36,020
refit reconfigure be it early extensible

655
00:21:34,130 --> 00:21:38,510
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> i can continue to add functions it</font>

656
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:39,980
really relies on<font color="#E5E5E5"> this notion of an agile</font>

657
00:21:38,510 --> 00:21:42,590
software methodology and deployment

00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:44,660
constant deployment of software such

659
00:21:42,590 --> 00:21:45,980
that it is really<font color="#E5E5E5"> about being software</font>

660
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:47,210
enabled and driven even<font color="#CCCCCC"> if there's</font>

infrastructure and hardware underneath

00:21:47,210 --> 00:21:51,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">that empowers it it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of this</font>

663
00:21:48,950 --> 00:21:53,000
notion of code is infrastructure<font color="#CCCCCC"> and if</font>

you're a<font color="#E5E5E5"> physical security if you're if</font>

you're a<font color="#E5E5E5"> security guy that's normally</font>

00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:58,399
used to deploying physical security of

667
00:21:56,030 --> 00:21:59,629
things like firewalls you know where we

668
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:01,460
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> just choke down on port 80</font>

669
00:21:59,630 --> 00:22:03,530
code is<font color="#CCCCCC"> infrastructure should</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> terrify</font>

670
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:05,360
you at the same point if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't have</font>

671
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:08,870
those skill sets because ultimately how

672
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:11,959
are you going to affect the ability to

673
00:22:08,870 --> 00:22:13,729
audit secure and ultimately control

674
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:16,460
infrastructure that can change at a

675
00:22:13,730 --> 00:22:17,870
moment by moment that's not

676
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:19,310
bad thing either and when we think about

677
00:22:17,870 --> 00:22:20,600
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know we're kind of we get</font>

678
00:22:19,310 --> 00:22:22,639
scared about this notion of elasticity

679
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:24,409
where in many cases it's not the biggest

680
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:25,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">problem that we have to solve and when I</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">talk about that we talk about these</font>

682

683
00:22:28,970 --> 00:22:33,590
this notion of what is powering these

684
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:36,440
clouds is is rapidly evolving we've got

685
00:22:33,590 --> 00:22:39,770
market leaders right now that<font color="#CCCCCC"> Thanks</font>

686
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:42,680
that have<font color="#E5E5E5"> really set the stage</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for the</font>

687
00:22:39,770 --> 00:22:44,900
evolution<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a lot of what a lot of what</font>

688
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:47,300
we we perceive as public cloud but you

689
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:48,920
also have a ton of movement now you've

690
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:51,139
got all of these providers is probably

691
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:53,120
20 more but but for example all of these

692
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:55,640
different cloud providers that have

693
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:58,040
released the capability to deploy their

694
00:22:55,640 --> 00:23:00,050
software in any environment and build

695
00:22:58,040 --> 00:23:01,639
stacks and open clouds on them so

696
00:23:00,050 --> 00:23:04,399
OpenStack dot orgs a good a<font color="#E5E5E5"> good example</font>

697
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:05,990
it was basically NASA and Rackspace

698
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:07,310
getting together they're open sourcing

699
00:23:05,990 --> 00:23:09,740
their code and making it available<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

700
00:23:07,310 --> 00:23:12,770
deploy you know a cloud a cloud

705
00:23:19,910 --> 00:23:23,510
ultimately consolidate but what's

706
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:24,980
interesting here is the stacks and how

707
00:23:23,510 --> 00:23:27,500
they function and how<font color="#E5E5E5"> you interoperating</font>

708
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:28,880
secure is pretty important so as we're

709
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:30,410
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to kind</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of go from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the bottom</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

710
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:32,060
the stack up if we look at the the

711
00:23:30,410 --> 00:23:33,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">underlying functions that make up</font>

712
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:36,440
infrastructure we look at the compute

713
00:23:33,830 --> 00:23:38,840
cores and memory elements you've got

714
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:40,640
compute fabrics now that could be

715
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:42,409
commodity they could be kind of massage

716
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:44,090
or engineered solutions<font color="#CCCCCC"> so I can be</font>

00:23:42,410 --> 00:23:46,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">completely proprietary and specialized</font>

718
00:23:44,090 --> 00:23:50,840
you have kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a battle raging between</font>

719
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:52,070
lots of<font color="#CCCCCC"> CPUs versus fewer cpus with lots</font>

720
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:53,600
of cores so that's kind of an

721
00:23:52,070 --> 00:23:57,020
interesting thing that's occurring today

722
00:23:53,600 --> 00:24:00,530

powered by<font color="#E5E5E5"> Nvidia that was I think</font>

727
00:24:06,770 --> 00:24:11,480
very interesting so it's not just<font color="#CCCCCC"> CPUs</font>

728
00:24:09,110 --> 00:24:13,040
anymore we've seen also GPUs being used

729
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:14,330
in password<font color="#E5E5E5"> cracking and recovery and</font>

730
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:16,909
those sort of things<font color="#E5E5E5"> and also by botnets</font>

731
00:24:14,330 --> 00:24:18,860
the whole goal<font color="#E5E5E5"> here is really about</font>

732
00:24:16,910 --> 00:24:21,890
lower power lower BTU output from

733
00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:23,780
temperature<font color="#E5E5E5"> and being highly dense we've</font>

734
00:24:21,890 --> 00:24:25,160
got interesting battles and discussions

735
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:27,139
raging between vendors about the stuff

736
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:28,460
between dedicated<font color="#E5E5E5"> versus huge amounts of</font>

737
00:24:27,140 --> 00:24:30,200

00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:32,450
hypervisors to man

739
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:34,070
its allocation and again everything is

740
00:24:32,450 --> 00:24:36,050
really here in the compute layer talked

741
00:24:34,070 --> 00:24:39,169
about as being managed by these restful

742
00:24:36,050 --> 00:24:41,120
HTTP<font color="#CCCCCC"> api's so you have things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like that</font>

00:24:39,170 --> 00:24:42,470
last stack which was which was google's

00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:44,030
a bunch of<font color="#CCCCCC"> stuff strapped onto a</font>

745
00:24:42,470 --> 00:24:46,100
cardboard and plastic board you know

746
00:24:44,030 --> 00:24:48,530
with even a battery backup you've got

747
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:51,770
stuff like cisco ucs you've got stuff

748
00:24:48,530 --> 00:24:55,430
like HP's matrix you've got things like

749
00:24:51,770 --> 00:24:59,570
the Talera 512 cores on a single<font color="#CCCCCC"> CPU you</font>

750
00:24:55,430 --> 00:25:01,370
have things like this see man<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think it</font>

James Hamilton who works at amazon web

00:25:17,420 --> 00:25:21,740
services as part of a larger

760
00:25:19,790 --> 00:25:23,060
presentation wrote this interesting deck

761
00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:25,790
that basically said data center networks

762
00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:28,460
are in my<font color="#CCCCCC"> way like what I what I need</font>

00:25:25,790 --> 00:25:30,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">today from it from a network capability</font>

764
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:32,480
in the traditional data center design is

765
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:35,090
really really stopping me from being

766
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:36,410
successful in deploying cloud so he

767
00:25:35,090 --> 00:25:38,659
talked about<font color="#E5E5E5"> a whole bunch of stuff like</font>

768
00:25:36,410 --> 00:25:40,040
I spent<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of money</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it emits a bunch</font>

770
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:43,970
I you where and how I<font color="#E5E5E5"> can place</font>

771
00:25:42,170 --> 00:25:45,500
workloads is actually restricted it's a

772
00:25:43,970 --> 00:25:47,690
mainframe business model I think all

773
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:48,710
valid points when mapped against the

774
00:25:47,690 --> 00:25:50,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">business model of a public cloud</font>

775
00:25:48,710 --> 00:25:51,830
provider and what they do so when you

776
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:55,010
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> of let's say a Google and Amazon</font>

777
00:25:51,830 --> 00:25:56,540
or a<font color="#CCCCCC"> facebook or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> even a Twitter and you</font>

778
00:25:55,010 --> 00:25:57,830
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what they do from a load</font>

780
00:25:57,830 --> 00:26:01,070
how their software is architected what's

781
00:25:59,420 --> 00:26:02,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">interesting is the network architecture</font>

782
00:26:01,070 --> 00:26:04,340
is very critical here or will be and

783
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:05,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">continued to be as it moves along so</font>

00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:06,649
these are<font color="#CCCCCC"> some really really dense</font>

00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:08,150
slides I'm going to kind of highlight

786
00:26:06,650 --> 00:26:09,890
them but<font color="#E5E5E5"> really you have to figure out</font>

00:26:08,150 --> 00:26:12,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">first of all where</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is the network is it</font>

very interesting software driven models

of networking you have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at the</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">fact that hugely abstracted networks</font>

796

<font color="#E5E5E5">really create challenges with things</font>

797
00:26:28,610 --> 00:26:32,389
like network topology simple issues that

798
00:26:30,770 --> 00:26:34,760
we've dealt<font color="#E5E5E5"> with before layer 2 and</font>

799
00:26:32,390 --> 00:26:36,260
layer 3 but things now that have impact

800
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:38,360
on things like support for multicast and

801
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:40,100
broadcast spanning tree protocol our

me the plumbing physical

805
00:26:43,970 --> 00:26:47,210
or a combination of security

806
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:50,419
capabilities to get me back visibility

807
00:26:47,210 --> 00:26:52,550
and management the initiative of

808
00:26:50,420 --> 00:26:54,080
mobility and the fact that as workloads

809
00:26:52,550 --> 00:26:55,760
move around all of the network

810
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:57,710
properties and policies and things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

to basically make them available this

823

notion of performance is huge issues

824
00:27:20,930 --> 00:27:23,870
with IO and public clouds based on that

825
00:27:22,550 --> 00:27:26,180
abstraction is still a huge issue

831
00:27:34,070 --> 00:27:37,129
this really brings back the issue for

most people of control<font color="#E5E5E5"> when they think</font>

multi point-to-multipoint dpns such that

842
00:27:55,430 --> 00:27:59,120
you can essentially connect resources

securely you know what that brings up is

846
00:28:02,390 --> 00:28:05,480
the need for both physical and logical

<font color="#E5E5E5">the network provider itself can't see</font>

what what's in that traffic which is

852

both good and bad so if we<font color="#E5E5E5"> follow this</font>

853
00:28:16,130 --> 00:28:19,730
along a little bit more what this gets

854
00:28:17,630 --> 00:28:23,210
into<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the argument between kind of big</font>

sets of of networking and so what that

00:28:35,660 --> 00:28:39,710
means is you know what in many<font color="#E5E5E5"> cases</font>

862
00:28:38,330 --> 00:28:41,149
these large public cloud providers want

are heavily virtualized incredibly

00:28:51,350 --> 00:28:55,040
with multi terabit switching fabrics

870
00:28:53,390 --> 00:28:56,840
they control most of that stuff in

871
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:57,950
software right with a network<font color="#E5E5E5"> they want</font>

872
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:59,959
these big gigantic

873
00:28:57,950 --> 00:29:02,029
flat fee lands well<font color="#CCCCCC"> these gems are a big</font>

874
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:04,309
gigantic fact lands not even<font color="#CCCCCC"> vlans</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

875
00:29:02,029 --> 00:29:06,679
don't know about<font color="#CCCCCC"> you but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I remember when</font>

876
00:29:04,309 --> 00:29:08,120
we used<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have giant big flat lands and</font>

877
00:29:06,679 --> 00:29:09,710
the problems both from<font color="#CCCCCC"> a security and</font>

878
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:11,059
performance perspective that that

879
00:29:09,710 --> 00:29:13,070
brought so that introduces some

880
00:29:11,059 --> 00:29:14,418
interesting challenges not the least of

881
00:29:13,070 --> 00:29:16,158
which is this notion of full bisection

882
00:29:14,419 --> 00:29:17,840
bandwidth versus massively

883
00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:19,279
oversubscribed ports and what that means

884
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:20,870
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> essentially that every port has the</font>

885
00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:22,549
ability to transmit at line rate without

886
00:29:20,870 --> 00:29:23,870
jumping and stepping on another which is

887
00:29:22,549 --> 00:29:25,850
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> very important</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> high-performing</font>

888
00:29:23,870 --> 00:29:27,199
compute environments because latency

889
00:29:25,850 --> 00:29:29,750
kills when you're moving huge chunks of

890
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:32,240
data petabytes so what these guys look

891
00:29:29,750 --> 00:29:35,240
for are these gigantic switching fabrics

892
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:36,620
right but that introduces issues for an

893
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:38,840
enterprise you in another cloud provider

894
00:29:36,620 --> 00:29:41,299
who may<font color="#E5E5E5"> not need that amount of of</font>

895
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:42,620
connectivity at latency issues that are

896
00:29:41,299 --> 00:29:44,269
an<font color="#E5E5E5"> issue when they want to introduce</font>

897
00:29:42,620 --> 00:29:46,219
things like segmentation how I deal with

898
00:29:44,269 --> 00:29:49,549
multi-tenancy<font color="#E5E5E5"> in scale how do I deal</font>

899
00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:50,539
<font color="#CCCCCC">with things like when a lot of that</font>

900
00:29:49,549 --> 00:29:53,210
networking is extracted in the

901
00:29:50,539 --> 00:29:54,649
hypervisor do I use private or do i use

902
00:29:53,210 --> 00:29:56,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">VLANs private vlans don't even have a</font>

903
00:29:54,649 --> 00:29:58,580
concept of what<font color="#E5E5E5"> that means how do I</font>

904
00:29:56,510 --> 00:30:00,080
separate maybe I separate control and

905
00:29:58,580 --> 00:30:02,090
data planes which is a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> what you</font>

906
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:03,830
see in the open for example open flow

907
00:30:02,090 --> 00:30:05,299
switch very interesting stuff where you

908
00:30:03,830 --> 00:30:09,260
can<font color="#CCCCCC"> use kind of an interaction of hybrid</font>

909
00:30:05,299 --> 00:30:10,309
physical and virtual networking so that

910
00:30:09,260 --> 00:30:12,200
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> brings up this issue of</font>

911
00:30:10,309 --> 00:30:13,610
programmable versus open and fixed

912
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:15,169
versus proprietary networking stacks

913
00:30:13,610 --> 00:30:17,389
which has a huge implication of what we

914
00:30:15,169 --> 00:30:19,159
do from a security perspective it<font color="#E5E5E5"> also</font>

915
00:30:17,389 --> 00:30:20,269
brings up the issue and what we see both

916
00:30:19,159 --> 00:30:22,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">in the enterprise and certain cloud</font>

917
00:30:20,269 --> 00:30:25,760

918
00:30:22,639 --> 00:30:27,889

920
00:30:27,889 --> 00:30:31,219
pipes on the same physical interface

921
00:30:29,929 --> 00:30:33,049
using things like data center ethernet

922
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:35,269
fiber channel over ethernet so you can

923
00:30:33,049 --> 00:30:37,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually carry storage data sand traffic</font>

924
00:30:35,269 --> 00:30:39,799
and networking data on the same physical

925
00:30:37,250 --> 00:30:41,659
pipe so if<font color="#CCCCCC"> that essentially is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> now a</font>

926
00:30:39,799 --> 00:30:43,129
single pipe and most of our security

927
00:30:41,659 --> 00:30:44,600
products like firewalls have no

928
00:30:43,130 --> 00:30:46,340

<font color="#E5E5E5">ends up being exposed via these</font>

941

this means<font color="#CCCCCC"> to us we we have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> looked at</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">us is the fact that today practically</font>

today the virtual machine boundary is

the new atomic unit of data center right

948
00:31:20,809 --> 00:31:24,320
so it's really the logical perimeter

00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:27,320
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> talk about today today for now</font>

and what<font color="#E5E5E5"> that means is ultimately you're</font>

951
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:31,010

it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to use different language</font>

954
00:31:32,210 --> 00:31:34,039
especially as

00:31:32,779 --> 00:31:35,480
infrastructure-as-a-service bubbles up

956
00:31:34,039 --> 00:31:37,070
the platform as a service so for<font color="#E5E5E5"> example</font>

957
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:38,510
Heroku doesn't talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about virtual</font>

they talk about slugs and dinos anybody

know what a slug or a<font color="#E5E5E5"> dino is most you</font>

962
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:50,149
probably haven't heard of that<font color="#E5E5E5"> but these</font>

963
00:31:47,390 --> 00:31:53,600
are new terms that denote workload an

00:31:50,149 --> 00:31:55,100
application and data content and most of

965
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:56,600
us have no idea what that<font color="#E5E5E5"> means from</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

967
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:59,840
we can gain from a programmatic

970
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:05,090
in this particular instance has an awful

of what a cloud provider<font color="#CCCCCC"> gives us unless</font>

1014
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:31,950
forensics but also for how<font color="#E5E5E5"> I protect</font>

1015
00:33:30,090 --> 00:33:34,470
stuff that could essentially reboot and

disappear momentarily<font color="#E5E5E5"> volume bucket and</font>

1017
00:33:34,470 --> 00:33:37,380
file size limits are different than they

<font color="#CCCCCC">are in traditional storage we have</font>

converged storage and networking I own

1020
00:33:39,090 --> 00:33:42,689
performance becomes an issue when we try

1021
00:33:40,649 --> 00:33:44,129
to add<font color="#E5E5E5"> security to it it impacts</font>

1022
00:33:42,690 --> 00:33:46,080
tremendously how we think about

1023
00:33:44,130 --> 00:33:48,539
application architecture the notion<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1024
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:51,270
mobility of storage itself like you got

1025
00:33:48,539 --> 00:33:53,370
vm moving around but the file systems or

1026
00:33:51,270 --> 00:33:54,899
the storage that<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually holds the data</font>

1027
00:33:53,370 --> 00:33:57,779
that these<font color="#E5E5E5"> things boot from it interacts</font>

1028
00:33:54,899 --> 00:34:00,779
with also has to move sometimes across

1029
00:33:57,779 --> 00:34:02,399
data centers so<font color="#E5E5E5"> bcp disaster recovery</font>

1030
00:34:00,779 --> 00:34:04,350
resilience is very important and

1031
00:34:02,399 --> 00:34:07,168
ultimately and clearly isolation and

1032
00:34:04,350 --> 00:34:08,940
security things like forensics in multi

1033
00:34:07,169 --> 00:34:11,190
tell environments are huge like how do

1034
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:14,369
<font color="#E5E5E5">you do a memory dump on a machine that</font>

1035
00:34:11,190 --> 00:34:16,290
has 384 gigs of physical memory that's

1036
00:34:14,369 --> 00:34:18,060
segmented over I don't know 15,000

1037
00:34:16,290 --> 00:34:19,349
clients and make sense of what<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1038
00:34:18,060 --> 00:34:21,029
means to you if you're doing forensics

1039
00:34:19,349 --> 00:34:22,530
investigation on a particular VM and one

1040
00:34:21,030 --> 00:34:24,540
particular spot that that could move

1041
00:34:22,530 --> 00:34:25,859
very<font color="#CCCCCC"> very interesting challenges from</font>

1042
00:34:24,540 --> 00:34:27,540
particulars from the protective storage

1043
00:34:25,859 --> 00:34:28,619
so then we have we kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of go up</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1044
00:34:27,540 --> 00:34:29,580
stack to metastructure from

1045
00:34:28,619 --> 00:34:31,589
<font color="#CCCCCC">infrastructure we start talking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

1046
00:34:29,580 --> 00:34:33,509
protocols and van<font color="#CCCCCC"> Jacobsen gave this</font>

1047
00:34:31,589 --> 00:34:35,009
really fantastic talks about an hour and

1048
00:34:33,510 --> 00:34:37,859
a half long you can watch it on google

1049
00:34:35,010 --> 00:34:39,720
videos at this Earl down below he was

1050
00:34:37,859 --> 00:34:41,369
talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of the evolution of</font>

1051
00:34:39,719 --> 00:34:43,168
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Internet and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I paired it well I got</font>

1052
00:34:41,369 --> 00:34:45,089
a paraphrase it for cloud but<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically</font>

1053
00:34:43,168 --> 00:34:46,408
he said<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know the cloud or in this</font>

1054
00:34:45,089 --> 00:34:47,668
particular case of the evolution

1055
00:34:46,409 --> 00:34:49,740
networking was talking about it is

1056
00:34:47,668 --> 00:34:51,779
really like where ARPANET was yesterday

1057
00:34:49,739 --> 00:34:53,040
and this code he used was at the outset

1058
00:34:51,780 --> 00:34:54,570
the new network looked like an

1059
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:55,800
inefficient way to use the old network

1060
00:34:54,570 --> 00:34:58,560
that's kind of where we<font color="#CCCCCC"> are with cloud</font>

1061
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:59,760
today right we are we're looking at what

1062
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:01,170
cloud offers and we say<font color="#E5E5E5"> well</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1063
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:04,109
doesn't make sense based on what we know

1064
00:35:01,170 --> 00:35:05,580
of networking and security today he said

1065
00:35:04,109 --> 00:35:07,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">you know what's interesting</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> when it was</font>

1066
00:35:05,580 --> 00:35:10,109
created tcp/ip was not made for

1067
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:11,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">ubiquitous any to any communication at</font>

1068
00:35:10,109 --> 00:35:13,020
that point there were a couple of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font>

1069
00:35:11,190 --> 00:35:15,089
giant machines sitting in these glass

1070
00:35:13,020 --> 00:35:16,109
rooms with a couple of users with a

1071
00:35:15,089 --> 00:35:18,540
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit amount of data</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> information</font>

1072
00:35:16,109 --> 00:35:20,400
that would talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> to each other right so</font>

1073
00:35:18,540 --> 00:35:22,200
what was what was interesting was when

1074
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:24,540
you look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> that model where TCP has</font>

1075
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:26,040
evolved um the things ultimately<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1076
00:35:24,540 --> 00:35:27,690
people were doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> with for example even</font>

1077
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:30,420
the telco<font color="#E5E5E5"> environments making phone</font>

1078
00:35:27,690 --> 00:35:33,150
calls was actually a side effect of what

1079
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:34,890
was<font color="#CCCCCC"> done inside the network so when we</font>

1080
00:35:33,150 --> 00:35:36,960
think about cloud to what cloud does

1081
00:35:34,890 --> 00:35:38,430
inside the mechanical pieces of<font color="#E5E5E5"> what it</font>

1082
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:39,900
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> able</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to offer that</font>

1083
00:35:38,430 --> 00:35:41,520
use cases are actually the side effect

1084
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:42,930
of that based on how you actually design

1085
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:45,990
the stacks and what they're optimized

1086
00:35:42,930 --> 00:35:47,970
for so communications today as van

1087
00:35:45,990 --> 00:35:50,250
Jacobson said are really disseminate<font color="#CCCCCC"> Ori</font>

1088
00:35:47,970 --> 00:35:52,109
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically say Marco and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> somebody</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

1089
00:35:50,250 --> 00:35:53,970
a whole bunch<font color="#CCCCCC"> of people can say polo you</font>

1090
00:35:52,109 --> 00:35:56,009
make<font color="#CCCCCC"> one request it's very asymmetric</font>

1091
00:35:53,970 --> 00:35:57,720
you make one tiny HTTP<font color="#E5E5E5"> request and you</font>

1092
00:35:56,010 --> 00:35:59,280
get petabytes of information back if you

1093
00:35:57,720 --> 00:36:01,049
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> it right so it's really about</font>

1094
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:03,089
disseminate or e<font color="#E5E5E5"> verses conversational</font>

1095
00:36:01,050 --> 00:36:05,550
so the notion of locating where stuff is

1096
00:36:03,089 --> 00:36:07,500
naming location and trust models are a

1097
00:36:05,550 --> 00:36:09,450
huge issue so when you get down to the

1098
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:10,349
end of it today's networking protocol

1099
00:36:09,450 --> 00:36:12,750
problems that we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1100
00:36:10,349 --> 00:36:14,250
metastructure layer like<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> BGP</font>

1101
00:36:12,750 --> 00:36:16,980
like all these things we see you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

1102
00:36:14,250 --> 00:36:18,420
coming back in style that are<font color="#E5E5E5"> being</font>

1103
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:19,859
attacked<font color="#E5E5E5"> today and the fixes we're</font>

1104
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:21,690
putting in place like DNS SEC has

1105
00:36:19,859 --> 00:36:24,480
convinced he's been<font color="#CCCCCC"> talking about it's</font>

1106
00:36:21,690 --> 00:36:27,359
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> not an architectural failing it's</font>

1107
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:30,510
really actually what van jake has<font color="#CCCCCC"> been</font>

1108
00:36:27,359 --> 00:36:33,058
called a success disaster right the side

1109
00:36:30,510 --> 00:36:34,440
effects of what tcp/ip I what tcp/ip

1110
00:36:33,059 --> 00:36:37,530
brought and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> innovation that people</font>

1111
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:39,569
use to leverage it really is is is a

1112
00:36:37,530 --> 00:36:40,559
success disaster and we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> dealing with</font>

1113
00:36:39,569 --> 00:36:41,940
what that means because the

1114
00:36:40,559 --> 00:36:43,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">infrastructure again it was never built</font>

1115
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:48,420
to do that doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> get doesn't give us</font>

1116
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:50,250
very quickly the ability to to handle or

1117
00:36:48,420 --> 00:36:51,599
secure it<font color="#CCCCCC"> so what's interesting is we</font>

1118
00:36:50,250 --> 00:36:54,000
kind of bubble up the stack<font color="#CCCCCC"> and we think</font>

1119
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:55,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">about infrastructure this is this is the</font>

1120
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:58,200
very interesting and<font color="#E5E5E5"> fascinating part</font>

1121
00:36:55,589 --> 00:37:00,270
here where architectural you're a

divide assets into logical groups but

00:37:56,480 --> 00:38:00,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">to stuff catches up so workload</font>

1154
00:37:58,369 --> 00:38:02,900
sensitivity or the network being aware

1155
00:38:00,470 --> 00:38:04,790
the network in the sum of all its parts

1156
00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:06,980
being aware of what is<font color="#CCCCCC"> running over it</font>

1157
00:38:04,790 --> 00:38:09,259
is really really important so people

1158
00:38:06,980 --> 00:38:12,410
still write crappy code so no matter how

1159
00:38:09,260 --> 00:38:14,540
good<font color="#CCCCCC"> or abstracted ultimately the</font>

1160
00:38:12,410 --> 00:38:16,759
infrastructure is that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> still a problem</font>

1161
00:38:14,540 --> 00:38:18,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">and if you look at the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> fact that people</font>

1162
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:20,720
continue to now adopt this notion of

1163
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:22,399
DevOps or agile code deployment constant

1164
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:25,759
deployment methodologies people are

1165
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:27,680
pushing<font color="#E5E5E5"> code constantly so how you going</font>

1166
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:29,390
to secure something with no known state

1167
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:30,649
that ultimately<font color="#E5E5E5"> is not persistent that</font>

1168
00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:32,960
doesn't survive a reboot that could

1169
00:38:30,650 --> 00:38:35,480
change every<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 minutes right how do I</font>

1170
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:37,670
security models adjust and so when<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

1171
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:40,700
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> of things this is out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of an AWS</font>

1172
00:38:37,670 --> 00:38:41,420
design presentation which talked about

1173
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:43,368
the fact that we have a lot of

1174
00:38:41,420 --> 00:38:44,359
decoupling here like if the top level

1175
00:38:43,369 --> 00:38:46,460
with controllers<font color="#CCCCCC"> or in this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> case</font>

1176
00:38:44,359 --> 00:38:47,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">function programmatically you know they</font>

1177
00:38:46,460 --> 00:38:49,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">used to be where one would call another</font>

1178
00:38:47,810 --> 00:38:51,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">one on call another well now we have</font>

1179
00:38:49,490 --> 00:38:54,169
this separated now we have essentially

1180
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:55,760
controllers talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> to cues and message</font>

1181
00:38:54,170 --> 00:38:57,349
buses which if you've done anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

1182
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:59,119
enterprise architecture and software so

1183
00:38:57,349 --> 00:39:01,010
architected you may be familiar with but

1184
00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:04,160
most of us<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think of this way we're</font>

1185
00:39:01,010 --> 00:39:05,960
used to essentially deploying a kind of

1186
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:07,339
this notion of firewalls in between

1187
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:09,740
these classical tears and everything's

1188
00:39:07,339 --> 00:39:11,869
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay well ultimately now not</font>

only<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to control the the VMS</font>

1190
00:39:11,869 --> 00:39:15,170
the processes the controllers<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have to</font>

1191
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:16,700
deal with securing the<font color="#E5E5E5"> cue and the</font>

1192
00:39:15,170 --> 00:39:18,859
messaging that's used in between them

1193
00:39:16,700 --> 00:39:20,569
which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a new concept but the point</font>

1194
00:39:18,859 --> 00:39:22,160
here in arguing is that the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1195
00:39:20,570 --> 00:39:23,480
fundamentally the solutions aren't

1196
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:25,790
flawed but<font color="#E5E5E5"> the problem has radically</font>

1197
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:27,080
changed right<font color="#E5E5E5"> I made that point</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of in</font>

1198
00:39:25,790 --> 00:39:30,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">surf and he literally kicked me in the</font>

1199
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:31,609
ass so the arm the notion here when we

1200
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:33,740
think about security models from an

1201
00:39:31,609 --> 00:39:34,940
infrastructure service perspective and

1202
00:39:33,740 --> 00:39:36,649
we look at where the line is drawn in

1203
00:39:34,940 --> 00:39:38,750
terms of responsibility<font color="#CCCCCC"> of who does what</font>

1204
00:39:36,650 --> 00:39:40,849
the lower down the stack you go the more

1205
00:39:38,750 --> 00:39:42,349
responsible you still are so if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> look</font>

1206
00:39:40,849 --> 00:39:44,119
<font color="#E5E5E5">at infrastructure as a service right</font>

1207
00:39:42,349 --> 00:39:46,160
everything above that orange line is you

1208
00:39:44,119 --> 00:39:47,420
you still have to do all of that

1209
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:49,460
regardless<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the fact that you're out</font>

1210
00:39:47,420 --> 00:39:51,170
sourced or you are giving somebody else

1211
00:39:49,460 --> 00:39:53,089
control over the infrastructure platform

1212
00:39:51,170 --> 00:39:54,440
as a service essentially moves the line

1213
00:39:53,089 --> 00:39:56,750
up a little bit more software as a

1214
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:58,760
service<font color="#E5E5E5"> even more so so when we think</font>

1215
00:39:56,750 --> 00:39:59,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">about this stack and we think about this</font>

1216
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:02,869
portion the left since<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're talking</font>

1217
00:39:59,839 --> 00:40:04,790
about infrastructure as a service all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

1218
00:40:02,869 --> 00:40:05,540
that security capability analogy is all

1219
00:40:04,790 --> 00:40:06,740
you

1220
00:40:05,540 --> 00:40:09,230
and when you think<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the fact that</font>

1221
00:40:06,740 --> 00:40:10,850
the VMS and especially the operating

1222
00:40:09,230 --> 00:40:13,280
system and applications are radically

1223
00:40:10,850 --> 00:40:14,900
changing that kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of presents a</font>

1224
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:17,030
challenge so when we think<font color="#E5E5E5"> about this</font>

1225
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:19,520
there's not a whole<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot you can do there</font>

1226
00:40:17,030 --> 00:40:22,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">at the infrastructure layer so if we</font>

1227
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:23,930
focus<font color="#CCCCCC"> here what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this really means is if</font>

1228
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:26,000
I have to secure the VMS or my

1229
00:40:23,930 --> 00:40:28,009
containers the OS and applications in my

1230
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:29,480
data it really<font color="#E5E5E5"> falls upon these three</font>

1231
00:40:28,010 --> 00:40:31,010
fundamental premises of what we're here

1232
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:32,690
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about building survivable</font>

1233
00:40:31,010 --> 00:40:33,830
systems that sustained attack regardless

1234
00:40:32,690 --> 00:40:35,540
of what the provider themselves do

1235
00:40:33,830 --> 00:40:37,310
building secure applications and

1236
00:40:35,540 --> 00:40:39,650
securing your data oh what a shocker

1237
00:40:37,310 --> 00:40:41,180
right the reality<font color="#CCCCCC"> is these are things</font>

1238
00:40:39,650 --> 00:40:43,730
that we still do regardless of the

1239
00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:46,279
deployment methodology so when we<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

1240
00:40:43,730 --> 00:40:47,510
about these these<font color="#E5E5E5"> three things and we</font>

1241
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:50,450
move up the stack to talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

1242
00:40:47,510 --> 00:40:52,010
survivable systems are you know it

1243
00:40:50,450 --> 00:40:53,930
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> it really means in many cases</font>

1244
00:40:52,010 --> 00:40:55,730
that if you continue to<font color="#E5E5E5"> build based on</font>

1245
00:40:53,930 --> 00:40:58,009
what you<font color="#CCCCCC"> think are relevant design</font>

1246
00:40:55,730 --> 00:41:00,500
patterns and in the enterprise you are

1247
00:40:58,010 --> 00:41:01,940
certainly going to be as<font color="#E5E5E5"> I say kind of</font>

1248
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:03,050
if your security sucks now you'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

1249
00:41:01,940 --> 00:41:05,690
pleasantly surprised by the lack of

1250
00:41:03,050 --> 00:41:07,610
change when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you move</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to cloud right and</font>

1251
00:41:05,690 --> 00:41:08,930
that's kind of the message<font color="#E5E5E5"> uh when you</font>

1252
00:41:07,610 --> 00:41:10,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">look at that same presentation</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

00:41:10,670 --> 00:41:13,070
cloud here's the recommendations for

00:41:11,690 --> 00:41:15,230
amazon right designs<font color="#CCCCCC"> or failure</font>

1256
00:41:13,070 --> 00:41:17,690
basically what this means is cloud isn't

1257
00:41:15,230 --> 00:41:19,640
unreliable but the mechanisms<font color="#E5E5E5"> that make</font>

1258
00:41:17,690 --> 00:41:21,590
up the pieces of cloud independently may

1259
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:24,170
be unreliable and any piece of them can

1260
00:41:21,590 --> 00:41:26,720
do and will fail at any time so designed

1261
00:41:24,170 --> 00:41:28,190
for failure I don't know about<font color="#CCCCCC"> you I</font>

1262
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:30,020
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> get paid to design for failure I</font>

1263
00:41:28,190 --> 00:41:31,580
get way to protect based on maximum

1264
00:41:30,020 --> 00:41:35,060
uptime<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that's kind of a disconnect</font>

1265
00:41:31,580 --> 00:41:36,860
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> talked about decoupling all pieces of</font>

about design think in parallel think

about<font color="#CCCCCC"> different storage options so this</font>

1273
00:41:48,020 --> 00:41:50,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">is advice in terms of public</font>

infrastructure to cloud<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's really</font>

1275
00:41:50,660 --> 00:41:55,609
targeted towards system administrators

1276
00:41:52,850 --> 00:41:57,560
and developers the security model

1277
00:41:55,610 --> 00:41:59,090
elements we'll get to in a min in a

1278
00:41:57,560 --> 00:42:00,860
minute but when we talk about designed

1279
00:41:59,090 --> 00:42:02,330
for failure it means<font color="#E5E5E5"> that your backup</font>

1280
00:42:00,860 --> 00:42:04,430
and restore strategy has to radically

1281
00:42:02,330 --> 00:42:06,080
change that your applications and your

1282
00:42:04,430 --> 00:42:08,029
infrastructure has to be impervious to

1283
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:09,259
reboot or relaunch that you have to

1284
00:42:08,030 --> 00:42:12,590
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the fact that you have to</font>

data to data stores again storage for

1288
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:20,899
as we always should use

multiple availability zones and regions

relational database services that<font color="#CCCCCC"> exist</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">actually see what's going on it means</font>

1441
00:47:07,990 --> 00:47:12,879
selecting platforms that enable robust

00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:15,940
monitoring is on you because you don't

1444

get it<font color="#E5E5E5"> from the provider it means</font>

1445
00:47:15,940 --> 00:47:20,650
utilizing what is called the 3<font color="#CCCCCC"> R's and</font>

1446
00:47:18,670 --> 00:47:22,360
the 3 R's are some of you may not have

1447
00:47:20,650 --> 00:47:24,040
heard of before but it's it's a design

1448
00:47:22,360 --> 00:47:26,200
philosophy that goes back quite a ways

1449
00:47:24,040 --> 00:47:27,700
it stands for resistance recognition and

1450
00:47:26,200 --> 00:47:29,560
recovery and it's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of the</font>

premises survivable systems and what it

00:47:29,560 --> 00:47:32,410
really talks about<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that you know</font>

00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:37,569
in the face of attack it talked about

1458
00:47:39,820 --> 00:47:43,300
is the ability to detect attack and

00:47:41,230 --> 00:47:45,070
essentially evaluate the extensive

1460

damage and communicate through secure

1461

ultimately that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have to recover that</font>

like abstract bizarre military jargon

1471
00:48:04,330 --> 00:48:09,279
that has no place in our lives<font color="#CCCCCC"> because</font>

if you are not<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking at your</font>

1478
00:48:20,710 --> 00:48:23,590
when we kind of look at what this means

1479
00:48:22,750 --> 00:48:24,880
we've kind of gone from the

1480
00:48:23,590 --> 00:48:26,470
infrastructure side of the world would

1481

looked at kind of protocols<font color="#E5E5E5"> we've looked</font>

1482
00:48:26,470 --> 00:48:30,220
at the underpinnings we looked at what

00:48:28,420 --> 00:48:33,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of survivability means at a high</font>

1484
00:48:30,220 --> 00:48:34,600
level what's very interesting is is is

1485
00:48:33,220 --> 00:48:36,100
this return or this notion of

1486
00:48:34,600 --> 00:48:37,900
information centricity in the middle of

1487
00:48:36,100 --> 00:48:39,220
the hamster sine wave of pain and what

1488
00:48:37,900 --> 00:48:40,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">this really means is this kind of the</font>

1489
00:48:39,220 --> 00:48:42,339

1490

back<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the thing that matters most of</font>

1492
00:48:44,080 --> 00:48:46,690
know this sounds like common sense and

1493
00:48:45,190 --> 00:48:48,130
preaching but the reality is we<font color="#E5E5E5"> never</font>

1495
00:48:48,130 --> 00:48:53,170
cloud is that opportunity and I implore

00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:55,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">you to kind of understand what why and</font>

easy to manage you should<font color="#CCCCCC"> assume context</font>

authorization accountability must

00:49:55,720 --> 00:49:59,140
to be able to establish trust access<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

self-describing and ultimately the data

1533
00:50:03,339 --> 00:50:06,849
privacy and security requires

1534
00:50:04,839 --> 00:50:08,109
segregation of duties and privileges by

secured when stored in transit and in

use and ultimately this notion of what

1538
00:50:11,770 --> 00:50:16,809
they call depolarization i think it was

1539

<font color="#E5E5E5">reprimanding has been in play for years</font>

so these<font color="#E5E5E5"> ten commandments have been</font>

right when these things are first

1545
00:50:27,670 --> 00:50:32,349
written and they make more sense than

1546

ever and when we think about these these

1547
00:50:32,349 --> 00:50:37,030
requirements it's up<font color="#CCCCCC"> to you to</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">essentially go lay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> smack down on vendors</font>

to support and build products that solve

1562

1585
00:51:43,770 --> 00:51:46,470
where what you actually need is the

00:51:45,180 --> 00:51:49,169
ability to move your data and<font color="#E5E5E5"> content</font>

1587
00:51:46,470 --> 00:51:50,339
across multiple providers so again this

1588
00:51:49,170 --> 00:51:53,610
comes<font color="#E5E5E5"> down to threat modeling and risk</font>

you basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> raise your hand saying we</font>

know the six key questions here are the

allows you to potentially start getting

a leverage point in some of this but I

added discovery because trying to find

for example

00:53:26,830 --> 00:53:30,310
you don't own but in many cases these

capabilities are not present in those

being said there's labeling technology

that based on metadata both in use in

00:54:07,030 --> 00:54:14,200
flight and an at rest can use labels to

1657
00:54:10,870 --> 00:54:15,190
identify via metadata what data there is

1658

and ultimately how it should be

have technologies that you know got

laughed at a couple of<font color="#CCCCCC"> years ago they've</font>

1662
00:54:20,350 --> 00:54:23,440
been around for a while they're starting

00:54:21,550 --> 00:54:25,120
to mature like data leakage data loss

1664
00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:26,140

a wholly unpopular term and drm but for

1670
00:54:34,720 --> 00:54:37,629
an enterprise when you start thinking

1671
00:54:36,190 --> 00:54:40,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">about digital rights management and how</font>

1672
00:54:37,630 --> 00:54:42,160
you it basically tell something that

00:54:40,120 --> 00:54:43,690
this this piece of data can be consumed

for this period of time with these

particular control requirements ed RM is

1676
00:54:46,870 --> 00:54:50,859
is there are platforms operating systems

and<font color="#E5E5E5"> applications that allow you to do</font>

1678
00:54:50,860 --> 00:54:55,570
that you also have a you know huge huge

1679
00:54:53,770 --> 00:54:57,460
dependency on encryption today so when

1680
00:54:55,570 --> 00:54:59,530
you use most public cloud providers they

1681
00:54:57,460 --> 00:55:01,510
provide you for example storage

1682
00:54:59,530 --> 00:55:03,820
capability if you wish<font color="#E5E5E5"> for that data to</font>

00:55:01,510 --> 00:55:05,650
be encrypted that's on you you have to

<font color="#CCCCCC">do that you have to engineer it which</font>

means issues that come back to the

digital certificates and encryption are

going to function outside of a normal

VPN that's going to bite you but this

1691
00:55:17,020 --> 00:55:20,410
technology of course encryption<font color="#CCCCCC"> has been</font>

1692

around<font color="#E5E5E5"> for a long</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> time but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as it relates</font>

00:55:20,410 --> 00:55:23,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">to things like row and column based</font>

encryption in databases and applications

1695
00:55:23,440 --> 00:55:28,030
and peering between various tiers in

1696
00:55:26,470 --> 00:55:29,980
these distributed application

1697
00:55:28,030 --> 00:55:31,870
environments encryption is a huge piece

1698
00:55:29,980 --> 00:55:33,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">of this right now we also have things</font>

1699
00:55:31,870 --> 00:55:35,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">like then we have to deal with this</font>

1700
00:55:33,580 --> 00:55:37,360
notion of entity management and mapping

1701
00:55:35,380 --> 00:55:39,670
that role based and claims based usage

1702
00:55:37,360 --> 00:55:40,390
capability against an identity or even a

1703
00:55:39,670 --> 00:55:41,769
machine to machine

1704
00:55:40,390 --> 00:55:44,319
interaction so identity access

1705
00:55:41,769 --> 00:55:46,509
management you know we have thousands of

1706
00:55:44,319 --> 00:55:47,859
tools at our disposal but again they're

1707
00:55:46,510 --> 00:55:50,470
not consistent you have to roll<font color="#E5E5E5"> your own</font>

1708
00:55:47,859 --> 00:55:52,779
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then new things</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tokenization so</font>

1709
00:55:50,470 --> 00:55:55,209
in for<font color="#CCCCCC"> example PCI this is a hot topic</font>

1710
00:55:52,779 --> 00:55:57,250
recently about substituting instead of

1711
00:55:55,210 --> 00:55:59,200
the real data instead storing actual

1712
00:55:57,250 --> 00:56:01,150
credit card data you're storing kind of

1713
00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:02,529
tokens that represent that data so

1714
00:56:01,150 --> 00:56:04,420
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not at risk right you're</font>

1715
00:56:02,529 --> 00:56:07,150
essentially of exposure of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> actual</font>

1716
00:56:04,420 --> 00:56:09,339
raw data you've got issues<font color="#E5E5E5"> like data</font>

1717
00:56:07,150 --> 00:56:11,260
dispersion so being able to chop up data

1718
00:56:09,339 --> 00:56:13,058
streams both in storage and<font color="#E5E5E5"> in-flight on</font>

1719
00:56:11,260 --> 00:56:14,769
the network chop them up into individual

1720
00:56:13,059 --> 00:56:16,990
packets encrypt them and then

1721
00:56:14,769 --> 00:56:20,439
essentially make M of n number<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

1722
00:56:16,990 --> 00:56:22,569
packets reassembly reassemble based on

1723
00:56:20,440 --> 00:56:24,039
using encryption so data dispersion is

1724
00:56:22,569 --> 00:56:26,380

you as I explained<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're mostly blind</font>

1780
00:58:13,239 --> 00:58:19,690
not quite like<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very much a Lego</font>

1781
00:58:16,059 --> 00:58:22,989
blocks problem so in the last minute or

1782
00:58:19,690 --> 00:58:24,849
so as<font color="#E5E5E5"> I wrap up here you know you're</font>

1783
00:58:22,989 --> 00:58:25,809
already here cloud computing<font color="#CCCCCC"> is already</font>

00:58:24,849 --> 00:58:27,970
happening<font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll all your applications</font>

1785
00:58:25,809 --> 00:58:29,619
move to cloud computing at public cloud

1786
00:58:27,970 --> 00:58:31,180
computing probably not at least<font color="#E5E5E5"> not for</font>

1787
00:58:29,619 --> 00:58:33,160
a long time which gives you the ability

1788
00:58:31,180 --> 00:58:35,109
internally if you start building<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

1789
00:58:33,160 --> 00:58:37,058
leveraging private clouds to start

1790
00:58:35,109 --> 00:58:39,369
getting<font color="#CCCCCC"> a hold on being</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> able to deploy</font>

1791
00:58:37,059 --> 00:58:40,450
technologies that work for you today so

1792
00:58:39,369 --> 00:58:43,539
we have to start<font color="#CCCCCC"> thinking about</font>

1793
00:58:40,450 --> 00:58:45,009
fundamental changes in architecture in

1794
00:58:43,539 --> 00:58:47,019
programmatic management and security

1795
00:58:45,009 --> 00:58:49,210
architectures that essentially wrap<font color="#E5E5E5"> into</font>

1796
00:58:47,019 --> 00:58:51,819
this we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to start thinking about</font>

1797
00:58:49,210 --> 00:58:53,619
centers of data not data centers it's

1798
00:58:51,819 --> 00:58:55,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of a funny little play on words but</font>

1799
00:58:53,619 --> 00:58:57,579
it really means we have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> build these</font>

1800
00:58:55,390 --> 00:58:59,589
survivable systems and we have to start

1801
00:58:57,579 --> 00:59:01,539
working<font color="#E5E5E5"> on requiring vendors and cloud</font>

1802
00:58:59,589 --> 00:59:03,430
providers to give us visibility and

1803
00:59:01,539 --> 00:59:05,079
transparency back to this data the

1804
00:59:03,430 --> 00:59:06,759
policies have to travel with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> data</font>

1805
00:59:05,079 --> 00:59:09,940
and applications without that it's

1806
00:59:06,759 --> 00:59:11,559
useless ultimately we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to allow the</font>

1807
00:59:09,940 --> 00:59:14,739
infrastructure to<font color="#E5E5E5"> at least be made via</font>

1808
00:59:11,559 --> 00:59:16,479
telemetry gain visibility and context

1809
00:59:14,739 --> 00:59:19,119
through standards-based telemetry

1810
00:59:16,479 --> 00:59:21,249
capabilities right and correlation so if

1811
00:59:19,119 --> 00:59:23,739
you think all the things like<font color="#CCCCCC"> siem you</font>

1812
00:59:21,249 --> 00:59:26,649
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> about a log correlation you think</font>

1813
00:59:23,739 --> 00:59:28,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">about telemetry monitoring and</font>

1814
00:59:26,650 --> 00:59:31,029
management these are<font color="#E5E5E5"> all things that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

1815
00:59:28,630 --> 00:59:33,069
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> as consistently reasonable and</font>

1816
00:59:31,029 --> 00:59:34,509
needed today so again the key takeaways

1817
00:59:33,069 --> 00:59:35,859
here when I<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of outlined the</font>

1818
00:59:34,509 --> 00:59:37,420
distinction<font color="#E5E5E5"> between different types</font>

1819
00:59:35,859 --> 00:59:39,130
across the spectrum of cloud providers

1820
00:59:37,420 --> 00:59:41,890
they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not all created equal they're</font>

1821
00:59:39,130 --> 00:59:43,180
not essentially all built for the same

1822
00:59:41,890 --> 00:59:44,979
<font color="#CCCCCC">reason for the same people and</font>

1823
00:59:43,180 --> 00:59:46,930
differentiation is really starting to

1824
00:59:44,979 --> 00:59:48,700
crop up between being able to expose a

1825
00:59:46,930 --> 00:59:51,430
lot of what this networking and security

1826
00:59:48,700 --> 00:59:53,710
capability means public cloud providers

1827
00:59:51,430 --> 00:59:56,259
you can allow you<font color="#E5E5E5"> to deploy applications</font>

1828
00:59:53,710 --> 00:59:59,920
incredibly securely if you wish to

1829
00:59:56,259 --> 01:00:02,799
embrace requiring the need to profoundly

1830
00:59:59,920 --> 01:00:05,499
alter architectural security operational

1831
01:00:02,799 --> 01:00:07,509
and organizational changes right and

1832
01:00:05,499 --> 01:00:07,848
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the hard part for most people to</font>

1833
01:00:07,509 --> 01:00:10,099
get there

1834
01:00:07,849 --> 01:00:13,309
arms around and ultimately you need to

1835
01:00:10,099 --> 01:00:15,140
deal with technology and memes and

1836
01:00:13,309 --> 01:00:17,299
topics that we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for the last 15</font>

1837
01:00:15,140 --> 01:00:19,400
years<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of been banging banging into</font>

1838
01:00:17,299 --> 01:00:21,259
we're in a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the technology is</font>

1839
01:00:19,400 --> 01:00:23,569
nascent it was you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> again solutions</font>

1840
01:00:21,259 --> 01:00:24,890
looking for a<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem but ultimately</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

1841
01:00:23,569 --> 01:00:26,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">have a lot of the key technologies</font>

1842
01:00:24,890 --> 01:00:28,009
available to us you need to pressure

1843
01:00:26,390 --> 01:00:29,930
your vendors and pressure<font color="#E5E5E5"> to providers</font>

1844
01:00:28,009 --> 01:00:33,979
to start<font color="#E5E5E5"> building them into products</font>

1845
01:00:29,930 --> 01:00:35,660
right so to use a play on words it

1846
01:00:33,979 --> 01:00:36,859
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> does</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> take a village here it takes</font>

1847
01:00:35,660 --> 01:00:41,779
the cooperation between two providers

1848
01:00:36,859 --> 01:00:45,348
there was a guy in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the in back in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1849
01:00:41,779 --> 01:00:48,140
kind of Russian history I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> he was a</font>

1850
01:00:45,349 --> 01:00:50,239
an ambassador<font color="#CCCCCC"> of sort his name was</font>

1851
01:00:48,140 --> 01:00:51,859
Potemkin and Catherine the Great wanted

1852
01:00:50,239 --> 01:00:53,420
to take a tour<font color="#E5E5E5"> of her countryside</font>

1853
01:00:51,859 --> 01:00:54,890
because she wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see how awesome</font>

1854
01:00:53,420 --> 01:00:56,390
people thought of<font color="#E5E5E5"> her so what they did</font>

1855
01:00:54,890 --> 01:00:58,848
was essentially had the villagers

1856
01:00:56,390 --> 01:01:00,259
because there was about prosperity she

1857
01:00:58,849 --> 01:01:03,079
wanted to feel good about herself<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1858
01:01:00,259 --> 01:01:05,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">the villagers stand up fake entire fake</font>

1859
01:01:03,079 --> 01:01:06,950
village fronts that<font color="#CCCCCC"> basically gave the</font>

1860
01:01:05,390 --> 01:01:08,779
illusion that everything was awesome I

1861
01:01:06,950 --> 01:01:11,058
thought everything was just perfect and

1862
01:01:08,779 --> 01:01:12,259
smiley and at this point that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of</font>

1863
01:01:11,059 --> 01:01:14,420
where we are today with the cloud right

1864
01:01:12,259 --> 01:01:16,219
we look at these shiny awesome use cases
