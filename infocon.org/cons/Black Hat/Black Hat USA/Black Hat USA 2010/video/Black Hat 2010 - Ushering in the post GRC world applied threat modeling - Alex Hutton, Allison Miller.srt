00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:33,419
practical application and a<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple of</font>

34
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:38,039
examples there are a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> people who</font>

35
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:39,780
talk these days about what is risk

36
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:41,430
management what is information security

37
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:43,439
and if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> listen to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of them</font>

38
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:45,600
they'll offer to you that information

39
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:48,329
security and what we see it's a lot of

40
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:50,158
pseudoscience and I actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> like to</font>

41
00:01:48,329 --> 00:01:52,559
think that we're more<font color="#CCCCCC"> of what Thomas</font>

42
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:55,020
Kuhn the<font color="#E5E5E5"> philosopher said is called a</font>

43
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:58,049
proto science and if you look at what

44
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:59,520
how he defines a proto science I think

45
00:01:58,049 --> 00:02:01,110
it will speak<font color="#E5E5E5"> to a lot of similarities</font>

46
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:03,030
if you've ever tried to create metrics

47
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:05,310
if you've ever tried to get data you've

48
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:07,250
ever tried to manage me by<font color="#E5E5E5"> evidence</font>

49
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:13,040
right

50
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:15,350
that's exactly<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we start to see so</font>

51
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:16,459
if<font color="#CCCCCC"> we are going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to study risk management</font>

52
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:18,350
if we're all<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to study information</font>

53
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:20,540
security what do we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to study this</font>

54
00:02:18,350 --> 00:02:22,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">is actually deceptively simple in my</font>

55
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:24,679
mind Jack Jones who I worked with for a

56
00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:27,019
while used to be a<font color="#E5E5E5"> security officer at</font>

57
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:29,750
nationwide he likes to find it as for

58
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:31,820
landscapes you have a threat landscape

59
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:33,080
and you need information and

60
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:35,090
understanding about the change in

61
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:36,650
information for the threat landscape you

62
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:38,720
have a controls landscape you have an

63
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:44,630
asset landscape and you have an impact

64
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:46,250
landscape as<font color="#CCCCCC"> you continue to teach me</font>

65
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:48,200
about these things one of the things

66
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:50,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">that I notice is that actually a Venn</font>

67
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:51,920
diagram better represents it that

68
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:54,680
represents the actually what we want to

69
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:57,049
study and the reason for that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is if you</font>

70
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:58,730
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> about where the circles overlap we</font>

71
00:02:57,050 --> 00:03:04,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually have synthesis of information</font>

72
00:02:58,730 --> 00:03:07,280
so one of the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I've been</font>

73
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:10,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">noticing and you guys who are actually</font>

74
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:12,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">in enterprise risk management programs</font>

75
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:14,209
to talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this and let me know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> how</font>

76
00:03:12,410 --> 00:03:17,359
you feel<font color="#CCCCCC"> but it's a disconnect between</font>

77
00:03:14,209 --> 00:03:19,700
GRC with the risk analyst actually is

78
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:22,670
doing and operational security and

79
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:23,988
recently I ran a quick poll it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

80
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:26,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know a bunch of people on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Twitter</font>

81
00:03:23,989 --> 00:03:29,030
bush people you know on the scary

82
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:31,010
metrics mailing<font color="#CCCCCC"> lists a bunch</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of folks</font>

83
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:32,959
who read the<font color="#CCCCCC"> new school of secure</font>

84
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:36,109
information security blog and so forth

85
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:38,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">and it's completely unscientific I just</font>

86
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:41,450
wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to see what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what I got back but</font>

87
00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:43,609
it did show that there was a really

88
00:03:41,450 --> 00:03:46,010
asked<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so how often does your cheat</font>

89
00:03:43,610 --> 00:03:48,049
RC analysts actually interact with

90
00:03:46,010 --> 00:03:52,429
operational security and for the most

91
00:03:48,049 --> 00:03:54,760
part I got back not at all never it just

92
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:54,760
doesn't happen

93
00:03:57,220 --> 00:04:02,320
and so when I thought<font color="#CCCCCC"> about GRC I</font>

94
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:04,120
actually see it as a construct the

95
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:06,340
contract that's been fabricated over the

96
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:08,470
past few years and i really find some

97
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:10,150
some real problems with this as a

98
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:12,220
construct and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm going to talk about</font>

99
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:16,390
them backwards the first one I want to

100
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:18,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about is compliance</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ok</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I see any</font>

101
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:21,399
compliance standard that's built as a

102
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:24,610
model why if you think<font color="#CCCCCC"> about PCI DSS you</font>

103
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:27,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">think about a standard like ISO 27001</font>

104
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:29,620
all this is is a bunch of people<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a</font>

105
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:31,180
group in a room saying well<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know we</font>

106
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:32,830
think this is how you<font color="#CCCCCC"> should defend a</font>

107
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:35,680
network these are the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we</font>

108
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:39,250
think you should<font color="#E5E5E5"> be doing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> inward to</font>

109
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:40,690
resist attackers if that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> so an</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Alison</font>

110
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:42,610
disagrees with me and that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay if</font>

111
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:45,430
that's so I offered to you that that's

112
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:48,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually a model and if it is a model</font>

113
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:52,540
then what Ichi Jane said in his book

114
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:54,669
basically is that models are really

115
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:55,810
hypotheses and they're subject to

116
00:04:54,669 --> 00:05:00,909
scientific method and they should be

117
00:04:55,810 --> 00:05:04,180
disproved they should be falsified so to

118
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:05,350
me compliance without metrics that's

119
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:08,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">just a bunch of guys in the room saying</font>

120
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:10,090
do this but if you start adding models

121
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:12,460
and metrics to compliance things now you

122
00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:14,500
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually say here's the standard and</font>

123
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:16,120
based on<font color="#CCCCCC"> what we've collected around</font>

124
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:18,610
incidents what we've collected around

125
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:21,729
collected around successes for this

126
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:23,440
standard well this standards bogus or

127
00:05:21,729 --> 00:05:26,229
this piece of the standards focus where

128
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:28,630
this standard needs to be you know we

129
00:05:26,229 --> 00:05:33,849
need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to audit on this standard in total</font>

130
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:35,469
so what about risk and this is where I

131
00:05:33,850 --> 00:05:39,850
really have a problem with a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of GRC</font>

132
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:42,310
suites and constructs risk is I've seen

133
00:05:39,850 --> 00:05:46,150
it basically is what Andrew Jake we've

134
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:49,780
calls a hamster wheel of pain it is find

135
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:53,349
issue right figure<font color="#E5E5E5"> out how bad the issue</font>

136
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:55,330
is fix the issue and then hope the next

137
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:58,900
time you do some discovery method you

138
00:05:55,330 --> 00:06:01,390
don't see the issue ever again right and

139
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:05,109
the problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have with this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> approach is</font>

140
00:06:01,390 --> 00:06:07,000
several fold first anybody who's done an

141
00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:08,500
actual enterprise risk assessment and

142
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,270
you get back like 500

143
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:12,820
pages of<font color="#E5E5E5"> information how are you</font>

144
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:14,320
supposed to synthesize<font color="#CCCCCC"> that how do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

145
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:15,730
how do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> check and this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is exactly</font>

146
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:18,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">like a vulnerability assessment right</font>

147
00:06:15,730 --> 00:06:21,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so great I've got 500 mediums what</font>

148
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:23,560
do I do<font color="#E5E5E5"> with that right how do I know in</font>

149
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:25,599
risk it's even worse I've got a little

150
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:27,880
likelihood in a high impact or medium

151
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:30,310
likelihood in a medium impact right and

152
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:32,020
that's just qualitative models when we

153
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:33,790
get into quantitative models half the

154
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:35,289
models if you look out there or using

155
00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:37,270
ordinal scales and then they're using

156
00:06:35,290 --> 00:06:39,070
multiplication on ordinal scales and if

157
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:41,200
anybody here knows anything about math

158
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:44,770
multiplying ordinal scales kind of

159
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:47,860
breaks the way the universe works if you

160
00:06:44,770 --> 00:06:50,349
can't do<font color="#CCCCCC"> it so that's kind of the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> first</font>

161
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:52,450
problem that<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I find the second</font>

162
00:06:50,350 --> 00:06:56,140
problem is this when you're actually out

163
00:06:52,450 --> 00:06:58,780
there collecting risk issues this

164
00:06:56,140 --> 00:07:01,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">particular threat specifically might</font>

165
00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:03,489
attack this particular asset in this

166
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:05,740
particular way and you're collecting

167
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:08,470
bunches of these you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> really making</font>

168
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:10,840
point predictions and if anybody has

169
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:12,940
ever studied complex adaptive systems

170
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:14,859
one of the tenants and and that's

171
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:16,240
difficult because it's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> new science and</font>

172
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:19,630
there are plenty of other definitions

173
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:21,790
and so forth out there but one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

174
00:07:19,630 --> 00:07:24,100
the basic tenets of it is that point

175
00:07:21,790 --> 00:07:27,610
possibilities are extremely difficult if

176
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:30,340
not impossible if<font color="#CCCCCC"> the only</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thing you can</font>

177
00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:35,110
do is identify patterns within those in

178
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:37,900
other words those who are the founders

179
00:07:35,110 --> 00:07:39,310
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that particular field would look at</font>

180
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:43,929
what we're doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> in information security</font>

181
00:07:39,310 --> 00:07:48,640
and figure are you guys nuts really<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

182
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:50,470
like this this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> something else Jack</font>

183
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:52,510
came up with and it's a new definition

184
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:54,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">for risk management if you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think about</font>

185
00:07:52,510 --> 00:07:55,450
it it makes a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of sense especially if</font>

186
00:07:54,310 --> 00:07:58,090
you think about it from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the siso</font>

187
00:07:55,450 --> 00:08:01,990
standpoint really it's taking exposure

188
00:07:58,090 --> 00:08:03,729
to risk and it's taking your capability

189
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:05,560
to manage risk what<font color="#CCCCCC"> you do with your</font>

190
00:08:03,729 --> 00:08:08,169
resources that the data owners have

191
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:11,050
given you and your matching that to the

192
00:08:08,169 --> 00:08:12,640
tolerance of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the data owners and it</font>

193
00:08:11,050 --> 00:08:14,350
should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> noted</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that as security</font>

194
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:16,479
professionals a lot of the times we

195
00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:18,160
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that means lower risk lower lower</font>

196
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:20,500
risk low risk well what about like DSW

197
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:21,820
who just went yeah okay great we're out

198
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:23,560
of PCI compliance have an eye

199
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:25,570
time we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take the fines right</font>

200
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:28,300
that was actually the<font color="#E5E5E5"> data owners saying</font>

201
00:08:25,570 --> 00:08:31,030
what they're telling<font color="#E5E5E5"> me to do that does</font>

202
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:32,470
not match my tolerance for risk so I'm

203
00:08:31,030 --> 00:08:34,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">not going to be bothered with it right</font>

204
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:39,880
now because it's expensive for me

205
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:41,289
economically taking that definition into

206
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:45,580
consideration let's talk about

207
00:08:41,289 --> 00:08:47,920
governance governance in a sense can<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

208
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:52,330
defined as I've heard it defined as that

209
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:55,839
which we were supposed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do right so I</font>

210
00:08:52,330 --> 00:08:58,000
have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem with that in that if</font>

211
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:59,770
you're in management theory and

212
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,420
governance really is an expression of

213
00:08:59,770 --> 00:09:03,370
how you should manage a business right

214
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:05,290
if you're in management business

215
00:09:03,370 --> 00:09:07,240
management theory this is W Edwards

216
00:09:05,290 --> 00:09:08,949
Deming who those of you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> recognize</font>

217
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:11,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">the face and for those of you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't know</font>

218
00:09:08,950 --> 00:09:13,630
he<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically changed the world with</font>

219
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:15,520
quality management one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the reasons</font>

220
00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:17,980
why Japanese automobile makers overtook

221
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:22,600
the US and so forth right because<font color="#CCCCCC"> he</font>

222
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:24,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">went and basically study what was going</font>

223
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:26,110
on in production lines and said okay if

224
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:27,339
<font color="#CCCCCC">you want quality if you want the right</font>

225
00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:29,800
production if you want optimize

226
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:30,760
production you're going to measure and

227
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:33,370
you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to measure and you're going</font>

228
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:35,380
to ply the results back right so

229
00:09:33,370 --> 00:09:38,860
basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's where Demings gave us</font>

230
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:40,960
this quote we<font color="#E5E5E5"> talked about governance</font>

231
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:43,180
how I interpret that is governance again

232
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:45,190
without metrics without models is

233
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:46,510
basically superstition it's a bunch<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

234
00:09:45,190 --> 00:09:49,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">guys get in the room saying well you</font>

235
00:09:46,510 --> 00:09:51,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">know this feels like how we should</font>

236
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,230
govern a security program by governance

237
00:09:51,730 --> 00:09:55,870
however with metrics and models my

238
00:09:53,230 --> 00:09:59,230
assertion is a capability to manage risk

239
00:09:55,870 --> 00:10:01,480
and let me explain<font color="#CCCCCC"> that this way here's</font>

240
00:09:59,230 --> 00:10:03,820
Dirty Harry everybody kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of note seen</font>

241
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:06,550
Dirty Harry movie one of my favorites

242
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:07,870
right so here's Dirty Harry and he's

243
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:11,620
staring<font color="#E5E5E5"> out you're staring down that</font>

244
00:10:07,870 --> 00:10:13,900
barrel now let's say he represents a

245
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:18,220
couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> things first off does he follow</font>

246
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:22,150
policies and procedures no no is the

247
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:24,010
effective yeah and I realized<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font>

248
00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:26,260
pointing to television in movies<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

249
00:10:24,010 --> 00:10:29,319
these but i think the logic is is he's

250
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:30,640
in here here's Barney Fife right was

251
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:33,160
Hugh stickler for policies and

252
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:34,339
procedures if you ever watch yes yes was

253
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:36,139
he very effective

254
00:10:34,339 --> 00:10:37,819
not without Andy Griffith behind<font color="#E5E5E5"> them</font>

255
00:10:36,139 --> 00:10:40,699
that was<font color="#E5E5E5"> the whole</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> freaking crux of the</font>

256
00:10:37,819 --> 00:10:42,259
comedy relationship and these guys if

257
00:10:40,699 --> 00:10:44,029
you gave these guys a procedure to

258
00:10:42,259 --> 00:10:45,410
follow like baking a cake the next thing

259
00:10:44,029 --> 00:10:48,709
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know you've got a rubber boot and</font>

260
00:10:45,410 --> 00:10:50,600
you know nitrous oxide in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> cake you</font>

261
00:10:48,709 --> 00:10:53,599
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it's the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> point being</font>

262
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:57,319
governance unless you're managing how

263
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:58,790
you're doing well it's basically

264
00:10:57,319 --> 00:11:00,649
superstition and you don't know if

265
00:10:58,790 --> 00:11:03,860
you're doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> a good job or not now think</font>

266
00:11:00,649 --> 00:11:06,350
about it this way<font color="#E5E5E5"> if he's your IDs guy</font>

267
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:10,129
if he's an operational security analyst

268
00:11:06,350 --> 00:11:15,709
do you have more or less risk with him

269
00:11:10,129 --> 00:11:19,459
at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the helm anyone less anybody want to</font>

270
00:11:15,709 --> 00:11:22,518
say less anybody want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to say more risk I</font>

271
00:11:19,459 --> 00:11:25,878
got Adam like and I knew that<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right</font>

272
00:11:22,519 --> 00:11:27,589
now comparatively if we have if we

273
00:11:25,879 --> 00:11:29,899
replace him he<font color="#E5E5E5"> takes off and leaves</font>

274
00:11:27,589 --> 00:11:31,819
because you can't take hanging with the

275
00:11:29,899 --> 00:11:33,920
the chief security officer anymore and

276
00:11:31,819 --> 00:11:38,059
we replace them with Don Knotts now

277
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:40,279
compared to Dirty Harry do we have more

278
00:11:38,059 --> 00:11:41,509
or less risk what if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we decide you know</font>

279
00:11:40,279 --> 00:11:42,589
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're overpaying Don we're going to</font>

280
00:11:41,509 --> 00:11:44,059
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> rid of him and we're going to hire</font>

281
00:11:42,589 --> 00:11:46,339
these three guys do we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> more or less</font>

282
00:11:44,059 --> 00:11:50,240
risk the point is that your capabilities

283
00:11:46,339 --> 00:11:52,550
impact your risk governance with metrics

284
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:54,800
and models is therefore simply a

285
00:11:52,550 --> 00:11:56,120
statement of your capability to manage

286
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:57,679
risk and as a component of risk

287
00:11:56,120 --> 00:12:02,569
management back to that earlier

288
00:11:57,679 --> 00:12:04,519
<font color="#CCCCCC">definition right you add to that</font>

289
00:12:02,569 --> 00:12:06,589
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I read on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the flight out</font>

290
00:12:04,519 --> 00:12:08,660
which was a study from Carnegie Mellon

291
00:12:06,589 --> 00:12:11,149
not in the paper that you'll find on the

292
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:14,449

294
00:12:14,449 --> 00:12:18,529
to you but it's a Carnegie Mellon study

295
00:12:15,889 --> 00:12:20,389
where they actually surveyed the board

296
00:12:18,529 --> 00:12:23,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">of directors for Fortune 1000 companies</font>

297
00:12:20,389 --> 00:12:25,939
anybody want to guess what percentage of

298
00:12:23,809 --> 00:12:28,100
those fortune 1000 companies<font color="#CCCCCC"> board</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

00:12:25,939 --> 00:12:30,529

00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:34,999
information security and IT governance

301
00:12:30,529 --> 00:12:39,559
anybody want to guess good eight percent

302
00:12:34,999 --> 00:12:42,649
it was thought it was zero it was zero

303
00:12:39,559 --> 00:12:44,059
in contrast<font color="#CCCCCC"> fifty six percent</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of them</font>

304
00:12:42,649 --> 00:12:45,860
were<font color="#E5E5E5"> really interested in risk</font>

305
00:12:44,059 --> 00:12:47,089
management programs the operational risk

306
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:51,800
management programs

307
00:12:47,089 --> 00:12:53,569
under which IT would fall under so as I

308
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:56,329
looked at GRC and I hope<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I've made</font>

309
00:12:53,569 --> 00:12:58,878
a convincing argument here we can't have

310
00:12:56,329 --> 00:13:02,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">any more disconnect operations actually</font>

311
00:12:58,879 --> 00:13:04,249
influences what we do so with that said

312
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:11,269
I do want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to turn it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> over to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Allison</font>

313
00:13:04,249 --> 00:13:13,879
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so a little bit of background on</font>

314
00:13:11,269 --> 00:13:16,279
what it is that I do I actually work in

315
00:13:13,879 --> 00:13:18,199
risk<font color="#E5E5E5"> and fraud and so for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me its</font>

316
00:13:16,279 --> 00:13:20,449
management is<font color="#CCCCCC"> not very theoretical at</font>

317
00:13:18,199 --> 00:13:22,910
all it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> very real in the sense that</font>

318
00:13:20,449 --> 00:13:26,180
when we make<font color="#CCCCCC"> mistakes we find out</font>

319
00:13:22,910 --> 00:13:28,670
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> we lose money and when it comes</font>

320
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:30,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">to management just in general one of the</font>

321
00:13:28,670 --> 00:13:32,180
things they dislike is losing<font color="#E5E5E5"> money and</font>

322
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:33,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's something they're very attuned to</font>

323
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:36,290
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that could explain why many</font>

324
00:13:33,649 --> 00:13:38,569
executives are quite interested in risk

325
00:13:36,290 --> 00:13:41,180
management with the actual emphasis on

326
00:13:38,569 --> 00:13:42,860
management one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the one of the points</font>

327
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:45,378
that Alex and I disagree on is whether

328
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:48,290
compliance programs actually provide a

329
00:13:45,379 --> 00:13:51,230
model I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font>

330
00:13:48,290 --> 00:13:53,748
because models are things that i use to

331
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:56,660
understand how my system is supposed to

332
00:13:53,749 --> 00:14:02,179
work and so compliance programs esteem

333
00:13:56,660 --> 00:14:06,170
or compliance seems like it's a good I

334
00:14:02,179 --> 00:14:07,610
do as opposed to necessarily things that

335
00:14:06,170 --> 00:14:09,469
are going to help me<font color="#E5E5E5"> make my system more</font>

336
00:14:07,610 --> 00:14:12,350
predictable and be able to

337
00:14:09,470 --> 00:14:16,939
systematically lower risk so one of the

338
00:14:12,350 --> 00:14:19,970
things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay is how we can use</font>

339
00:14:16,939 --> 00:14:22,459
models in fact to close the gap between

340
00:14:19,970 --> 00:14:25,550
assessment which is what I feel like a

341
00:14:22,459 --> 00:14:34,160
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of governance and M how are you</font>

342
00:14:25,550 --> 00:14:36,229
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to help me here hello okay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

343
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:42,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">right cool</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay close the gap between</font>

344
00:14:36,230 --> 00:14:44,899
assessment and defense so what what does

345
00:14:42,110 --> 00:14:46,879
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean there's three major places</font>

346
00:14:44,899 --> 00:14:49,550
where I see risk risk and threat

347
00:14:46,879 --> 00:14:52,399
modeling as being useful to an a risk

348
00:14:49,550 --> 00:14:54,050
management program design management and

349
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:55,759
operations and what I mean here when I

350
00:14:54,050 --> 00:14:57,859
say design is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> just design of the</font>

351
00:14:55,759 --> 00:15:00,410
control system but<font color="#CCCCCC"> the design of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

352
00:14:57,860 --> 00:15:02,600
system itself embedding risk man

353
00:15:00,410 --> 00:15:04,850
into the design of your system itself

354
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:07,009
and then management here<font color="#E5E5E5"> meaning the</font>

355
00:15:04,850 --> 00:15:09,649
processes that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we undertake in order to</font>

356
00:15:07,009 --> 00:15:13,310
keep the system predictable and finally

357
00:15:09,649 --> 00:15:15,589
operations in in in the Operations

358
00:15:13,310 --> 00:15:17,839
Section<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm talking a little bit more</font>

359
00:15:15,589 --> 00:15:20,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">about really technical modeling like</font>

360
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:22,579
statistical modeling efforts that you

361
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:25,250
would actually employ in running your

362
00:15:22,579 --> 00:15:27,920
system so when we think<font color="#E5E5E5"> about design if</font>

363
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:29,569
you if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> are of the nature that you</font>

364
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:32,029
think security should<font color="#E5E5E5"> be built in as</font>

365
00:15:29,569 --> 00:15:35,029
opposed to bolted on I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think that you</font>

366
00:15:32,029 --> 00:15:38,480
would find hope in this quote<font color="#E5E5E5"> Len Fisher</font>

367
00:15:35,029 --> 00:15:41,060
whose a has written some books on game

368
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:43,220
theory suggesting that evolution favors

369
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:45,050
strategies that minimize the risk of

370
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:47,600
loss as opposed to maximize the chance

371
00:15:45,050 --> 00:15:49,490
of gain and I think that you know human

372
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:51,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">behavior is such that folks are actually</font>

373
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:55,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">risk-averse most people don't really</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">have a high tolerance for RIT successful</font>

375
00:15:55,910 --> 00:16:01,129
systems are going to be the ones<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

376
00:15:57,319 --> 00:16:07,849
<font color="#CCCCCC">are that are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> able to defend and evolve</font>

377
00:16:01,129 --> 00:16:09,470
against unnecessary risks and and this

378
00:16:07,850 --> 00:16:12,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">is one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the reasons why system models</font>

379
00:16:09,470 --> 00:16:14,300
are actually different from maps I think

380
00:16:12,290 --> 00:16:16,730
when we do assessments weather for

381
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:18,859
compliance purposes or for enterprise

382
00:16:16,730 --> 00:16:20,540
risk management purposes essentially

383
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:34,550
what we are doing is we are cataloging

384
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:38,839
or inventory inconsistently include

385
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:41,479
dynamics the the influences that drive

386
00:16:38,839 --> 00:16:44,000
how a system actually behaves not just

387
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:45,769
what is in the system the other thing

388
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,540
that is quite<font color="#CCCCCC"> interesting about system</font>

389
00:16:45,769 --> 00:16:49,189
models is that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have to have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>

390
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:52,610
understanding<font color="#E5E5E5"> of your system boundaries</font>

391
00:16:49,189 --> 00:16:54,529
a system model essentially I'm good

392
00:16:52,610 --> 00:16:56,089
white boarded I suppose but if you just

393
00:16:54,529 --> 00:16:58,639
want to imagine I assistant<font color="#CCCCCC"> model it</font>

394
00:16:56,089 --> 00:17:02,000
could just be a circle with input

395
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:04,370
something goes on an output and the

396
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,650
better the better the model the better

397
00:17:04,369 --> 00:17:08,270
your ability to predict based on a store

398
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:10,100
an input and<font color="#CCCCCC"> your understanding</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of your</font>

00:17:10,099 --> 00:17:13,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">so that sounded like a lot of fun let's</font>

401
00:17:13,309 --> 00:17:15,079

moment where i work for paypal where our

paypal system boundaries are our system

430
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:29,840
boundaries that are firewalls or are

431
00:18:26,870 --> 00:18:31,580
they at our users client systems so if

432
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:33,800
you acknowledge<font color="#CCCCCC"> that your risk is</font>

interconnected with your customers or

your users or your partner's risk then

435
00:18:36,230 --> 00:18:40,100
you have to acknowledge the boundary of

your system is a lot broader than<font color="#CCCCCC"> what</font>

00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:45,530
you necessarily have control over<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

438
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:48,290
your own day-to-day operations why is<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

439
00:18:45,530 --> 00:18:50,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">useful to acknowledge this it's useful</font>

440
00:18:48,290 --> 00:18:54,020
to acknowledge this because when you're

441
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:56,060
dealing with attacks or risks or or

442
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:58,100
whatever you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to call</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> them those</font>

443
00:18:56,060 --> 00:19:00,020
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are coming</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> from the outside</font>

444
00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:02,510
in or you know there could be an insider

445
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:05,150
threat as well but let's just say threat

446
00:19:02,510 --> 00:19:08,150
agents are external to the appropriate

447
00:19:05,150 --> 00:19:10,100
processing of your system where<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

448
00:19:08,150 --> 00:19:12,380
those threats going to manifest are they

449
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:14,449
going to manifest on your systems or do

450
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:16,520
you also need to take into consideration

451
00:19:14,450 --> 00:19:18,110
in order to estimate what's really going

452
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:21,260
to happen in your system are you going

453
00:19:18,110 --> 00:19:23,899
to have to understand the vulnerability

454
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:26,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">or the system dynamics</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> users as</font>

455
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:27,500
well<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that's kind of a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> rhetorical</font>

456
00:19:26,690 --> 00:19:29,930
question

457
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:32,540
I think we all acknowledge that when we

458
00:19:29,930 --> 00:19:34,580
have users client security can be just

459
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:40,610
as important as say having a hardened

460
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:42,679
firewall in place all right so everybody

461
00:19:40,610 --> 00:19:45,560
likes<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about fraud I want to give</font>

462
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:47,600
a really high level example of a threat

463
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:49,760
model something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I find</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a little bit</font>

464
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:51,379
useful something that sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of summarizes</font>

465
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:56,480
some of the concepts I'm talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

466
00:19:51,380 --> 00:20:00,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">around design now i have here an example</font>

467
00:19:56,480 --> 00:20:03,710
of essentially a genericized version of

468
00:20:00,350 --> 00:20:07,250
fraud<font color="#E5E5E5"> in this case</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's buyer fraud and</font>

469
00:20:03,710 --> 00:20:10,490
we in trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> diagram this out I</font>

00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:13,910
initially<font color="#E5E5E5"> started with threat three dry</font>

471
00:20:10,490 --> 00:20:15,410
agam threat tree diagram are any of you

472
00:20:13,910 --> 00:20:18,350
familiar with<font color="#E5E5E5"> Schneider's paper on this</font>

473
00:20:15,410 --> 00:20:20,900
he published it in like 99 thank you

474
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:23,719
thank<font color="#CCCCCC"> you very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> much so I really liked</font>

475
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:26,330
the paper and what I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> wondering I was</font>

476
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:29,660
wondering what we could do with threat

477
00:20:26,330 --> 00:20:31,520
with threat trees if you if you if they

478
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:34,880
were iterative and what I kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of mean</font>

479
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:37,550
there is how<font color="#E5E5E5"> can you map out an entire</font>

480
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:39,410
system using a threat tree and I had a

481
00:20:37,550 --> 00:20:42,200
really hard<font color="#E5E5E5"> time doing that because what</font>

482
00:20:39,410 --> 00:20:44,420
I found was the actual mechanisms by

483
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:48,110
which the threats manifested clustered

484
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:51,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">and so what I mean here is what I in in</font>

485
00:20:48,110 --> 00:20:54,199
trying to sort of diagnose or from a

486
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:56,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">high level expose what the actual threat</font>

487
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:58,340
model is for fraud everything was

488
00:20:56,810 --> 00:21:00,379
clustering in these<font color="#CCCCCC"> street categories</font>

489
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:03,800
there was some kind of technical exploit

490
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:06,950
and then some kind of misuse of

491
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:09,290
credentials but<font color="#E5E5E5"> ultimately then funds</font>

492
00:21:06,950 --> 00:21:10,670
come out of the system and so when you

493
00:21:09,290 --> 00:21:13,129
sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of cluster these you can kind of</font>

494
00:21:10,670 --> 00:21:14,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">cut</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and paste which type of attack or</font>

495
00:21:13,130 --> 00:21:17,840
exactly<font color="#E5E5E5"> what it is that the fraudster</font>

496
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:20,120
does but let you know let's walk through

497
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:22,220
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay someone sends out a phishing</font>

498
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:26,780
email the fishing mail has an obfuscated

499
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:29,570
adore or maybe it's actually using a

500
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:31,730
like the<font color="#E5E5E5"> special character code set</font>

501
00:21:29,570 --> 00:21:33,560
whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> so that you can actually you</font>

502
00:21:31,730 --> 00:21:35,660
can't actually see that it's redirecting

503
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:37,940
you and then you are redirected

504
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:39,320
someplace where<font color="#E5E5E5"> either you're asked for</font>

505
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:41,120
your credentials than you give them up

506
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:42,800
or you get a drive

507
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:44,840
malware and your credentials are sucked

508
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:47,629
right off of<font color="#E5E5E5"> your computer in which case</font>

509
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:51,320
now and an evil act or has your

510
00:21:47,630 --> 00:21:53,030
credentials and so of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course when we</font>

511
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:55,040
kind of look at the market for

512
00:21:53,030 --> 00:21:57,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">credential theft we find</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that it's not</font>

513
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:59,840
always the person who has grabbed the

514
00:21:57,710 --> 00:22:02,930
credentials that actually uses them

515
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:04,429
reselling that happens within that

516
00:22:02,930 --> 00:22:07,640
industry which is kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of an interesting</font>

517
00:22:04,430 --> 00:22:10,400
economic thing to look at on its own but

518
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:13,670
eventually then someone has to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be the</font>

519
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:16,970
the actor the fraudster and so<font color="#CCCCCC"> even</font>

520
00:22:13,670 --> 00:22:20,990
though as a technical exploit that that

521
00:22:16,970 --> 00:22:23,150
started off this chain then things what

522
00:22:20,990 --> 00:22:25,910
what ends up happening is your basic

523
00:22:23,150 --> 00:22:27,410
boring run-of-the-mill financial fraud

524
00:22:25,910 --> 00:22:29,360
someone's going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to use a stolen credit</font>

525
00:22:27,410 --> 00:22:31,190
card or they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a stolen</font>

526
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:32,540
bank account or they're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> ATO</font>

527
00:22:31,190 --> 00:22:33,770
some kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of account they're going to</font>

528
00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:35,720
impersonate someone they're going to

529
00:22:33,770 --> 00:22:38,150
commit fraud and some kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

530
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:41,300
transaction happens but that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not all</font>

531
00:22:38,150 --> 00:22:43,550
necessarily because eventually the

532
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:45,350
person who convinced the fraud is going

533
00:22:43,550 --> 00:22:47,210
to want money out of the system they

534
00:22:45,350 --> 00:22:50,840
want cash they want<font color="#E5E5E5"> something that they</font>

535
00:22:47,210 --> 00:22:51,980
can convert into cash so if you're

536
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:54,020
interested<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's a couple different</font>

537
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:56,630
ways<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do that you can buy goods that</font>

538
00:22:54,020 --> 00:22:59,240
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> easily resold you can like digital</font>

539
00:22:56,630 --> 00:23:01,190
goods or consumer electronics or you can

540
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:03,770
try and figure out how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to bounce funds</font>

541
00:23:01,190 --> 00:23:07,850
around across different systems in order

542
00:23:03,770 --> 00:23:10,190
to extract cash to yourself so any

543
00:23:07,850 --> 00:23:16,610
questions<font color="#E5E5E5"> about this oftentimes people</font>

544
00:23:10,190 --> 00:23:19,429
questions about fraud yes what's heo

545
00:23:16,610 --> 00:23:24,050
sorry i can't take over is what that

546
00:23:19,429 --> 00:23:27,620
stands for so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think yeah okay any</font>

547
00:23:24,050 --> 00:23:30,620
other<font color="#E5E5E5"> questions but you see how it you</font>

548
00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:32,449
see how the technical attack it could be

549
00:23:30,620 --> 00:23:34,520
any kind of thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> you could have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> fishing</font>

550
00:23:32,450 --> 00:23:36,620
or you could have malware or you could

551
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:39,800
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a joke program it doesn't</font>

552
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:41,600
have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be it someone gives something</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> up</font>

553
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:43,520
or that someone extrapolate something

554
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:45,649
based on pulling information from social

555
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:48,170
networks there's all different kinds of

556
00:23:45,650 --> 00:23:51,740
ways you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can get through the chain</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> but</font>

557
00:23:48,170 --> 00:23:53,420
ultimately<font color="#E5E5E5"> the output is money comes out</font>

558
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:54,950
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's the really interesting part</font>

559
00:23:53,420 --> 00:23:57,290
for us

560
00:23:54,950 --> 00:23:59,450
because for folks who are in fraud

561
00:23:57,290 --> 00:24:01,580
because of course that's where it

562
00:23:59,450 --> 00:24:04,130
becomes really real for us the other

563
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:06,560
thing to note here is up there on the

564
00:24:04,130 --> 00:24:08,120
exploit vulnerabilities section those

565
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:12,290
aren't things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> happen on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> our system</font>

566
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:15,919
that we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> control but the threats that</font>

567
00:24:12,290 --> 00:24:19,070
we face<font color="#E5E5E5"> from this type of activity</font>

568
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:21,500
manifest on our system in a really real

569
00:24:19,070 --> 00:24:24,620
indirect way and it behooves us to

570
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:28,070
understand how the whole chain works

571
00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:31,100
when we are designing our controls for

572
00:24:28,070 --> 00:24:33,919
us at the email for example not<font color="#CCCCCC"> only do</font>

573
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:35,570
we have extensive controls on the system

574
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:38,120
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> we also have outbound efforts</font>

575
00:24:35,570 --> 00:24:42,139
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you want to attack a threat</font>

576
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:43,909
then you you know you your economical

577
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:46,910
and opportunistic and<font color="#E5E5E5"> how you do that</font>

578
00:24:43,910 --> 00:24:51,110
and so if<font color="#CCCCCC"> we can help</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for example get</font>

579
00:24:46,910 --> 00:24:54,440
rid of phishing site then that<font color="#E5E5E5"> helps</font>

580
00:24:51,110 --> 00:24:59,870

606
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:11,820
your performance is because essentially

607
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:14,129
what management<font color="#E5E5E5"> is essentially what</font>

608
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:16,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">management is is having an estimated</font>

609
00:26:14,130 --> 00:26:17,640
performance and then managing the

610
00:26:16,050 --> 00:26:19,800
operations of your system to that

611
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:22,770
performance and when something's not

612
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:25,560
working if something is is behaving in a

613
00:26:22,770 --> 00:26:27,150
way that is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you need to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> meet</font>

614
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:29,159
your objectives you go in and you change

615
00:26:27,150 --> 00:26:32,670
it which is why design and management

616
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:35,430
are sort of eret of processes here and

617
00:26:32,670 --> 00:26:36,930
let<font color="#CCCCCC"> me move on quickly to operations</font>

618
00:26:35,430 --> 00:26:38,250
because I know that we're going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to talk</font>

619
00:26:36,930 --> 00:26:42,720
a little bit more<font color="#CCCCCC"> about metrics later</font>

620
00:26:38,250 --> 00:26:47,010
the way that technically risk management

621
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:48,960
is is dives into operations usually has

622
00:26:47,010 --> 00:26:53,310
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do with the automation of decisions</font>

623
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:56,280
so an example of a system model that is

624
00:26:53,310 --> 00:26:58,290
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is driven into operations I</font>

625
00:26:56,280 --> 00:27:00,930
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> give a sort of active traffic</font>

626
00:26:58,290 --> 00:27:04,920
flow analysis basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> the way you know</font>

627
00:27:00,930 --> 00:27:07,620
the way the timings of lights on city

628
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:11,010
streets are put into place there are a

629
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:13,590
lot of different<font color="#E5E5E5"> heavy duty statistical</font>

00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:17,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">to optimize traffic flow through streets</font>

632
00:27:15,690 --> 00:27:21,030
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> as an example so you can imagine</font>

633
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:24,120
that that gets pretty complicated and

634
00:27:21,030 --> 00:27:25,770
just sort<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a nice little quote from</font>

635
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:27,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">one my favorite physicists prediction is</font>

636
00:27:25,770 --> 00:27:31,320
very difficult especially about the

637
00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:33,510
future absolutely that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> true and when</font>

638
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:36,990
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> however using computers can really</font>

639
00:27:33,510 --> 00:27:39,780
help you<font color="#E5E5E5"> do that and the way that we use</font>

640
00:27:36,990 --> 00:27:43,380
quantitative models that are driven into

641
00:27:39,780 --> 00:27:49,379
operations is basically to assist in

642
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:51,060
assist in making system decisions and

643
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:53,100
this is when we can actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> come back</font>

644
00:27:51,060 --> 00:27:55,470
to the concept of feedback loops in

645
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:57,870
management we're interested in feedback

646
00:27:55,470 --> 00:27:59,520
loops because feedback loops give us an

647
00:27:57,870 --> 00:28:01,800
understanding of metrics how we're

648
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:02,340
performing in in these quantitative

649
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:04,139
model

650
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:06,480
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way the reason why we're interested</font>

651
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:07,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">in feedback loops is because at some</font>

652
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:09,659
<font color="#CCCCCC">point we're going to have to go back and</font>

653
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:12,689
evaluate whether we made a good decision

654
00:28:09,659 --> 00:28:14,820
or a bad decision statistics allow us to

655
00:28:12,690 --> 00:28:16,740
optimize decisions but<font color="#E5E5E5"> in order to</font>

656
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:18,899
optimize you have to know<font color="#E5E5E5"> when you are</font>

657
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:22,799
right or wrong so in the example of

658
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:25,140
fraud for example we need to know if we

659
00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:27,299
declined a transaction was it fraud or

660
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:29,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">wasn't it if we approve to transaction</font>

661
00:28:27,299 --> 00:28:31,620
was it fraud or<font color="#E5E5E5"> wasn't it and when you</font>

662
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:34,200
collect the you collect the evidence

663
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:38,309
then you can go back<font color="#CCCCCC"> and you can improve</font>

664
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:41,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">your models so essentially what we find</font>

665
00:28:38,309 --> 00:28:43,830
in financial fraud is that patterns that

666
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:45,570
can be defined and they can be<font color="#E5E5E5"> to find</font>

667
00:28:43,830 --> 00:28:48,178
in a number of different<font color="#E5E5E5"> ways you can</font>

668
00:28:45,570 --> 00:28:50,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">use heuristic statistics machine logic</font>

669
00:28:48,179 --> 00:28:52,350
but but ultimately you're going to have

670
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:53,820
data that gives you some kind of

671
00:28:52,350 --> 00:28:55,830
evidence<font color="#E5E5E5"> that something good or bad</font>

672
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:58,260
happened and if you can if you can

673
00:28:55,830 --> 00:29:00,870
define that pattern then you can

674
00:28:58,260 --> 00:29:02,520
actually you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually detect it</font>

675
00:29:00,870 --> 00:29:05,070
using these different techniques and

676
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:08,399
that is one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the reasons why we</font>

677
00:29:05,070 --> 00:29:11,370
consume so much data so if you are

678
00:29:08,399 --> 00:29:12,658
embedding models within your operations

679
00:29:11,370 --> 00:29:15,059
you're going to be a data hungry

680
00:29:12,659 --> 00:29:17,039
organization that's great because the

681
00:29:15,059 --> 00:29:19,500
output of your performance then is

682
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:21,270
pretty easily quantified which you can

683
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:24,720
explain<font color="#E5E5E5"> to management usually makes them</font>

684
00:29:21,270 --> 00:29:26,700
very very<font color="#CCCCCC"> happy now in our system we</font>

685
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:28,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">have a lot of internal data that we can</font>

686
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:30,990
use and most folks<font color="#E5E5E5"> who managed systems</font>

687
00:29:28,890 --> 00:29:33,090
end up creating tons and tons and tons

688
00:29:30,990 --> 00:29:35,669
of data if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're instrumenting things</font>

689
00:29:33,090 --> 00:29:37,620
that interesting pute interesting points

690
00:29:35,669 --> 00:29:40,110
for example in fraud where the money

691
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:41,969
leaves the system or where<font color="#CCCCCC"> financial</font>

692
00:29:40,110 --> 00:29:43,649
instruments are attached to<font color="#CCCCCC"> an account</font>

693
00:29:41,970 --> 00:29:46,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">or where transactions happen between</font>

694
00:29:43,649 --> 00:29:47,699
people you end up creating tons and tons

695
00:29:46,409 --> 00:29:53,970
of data that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can use</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to analyze</font>

696
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:55,679
later however and however<font color="#E5E5E5"> internal data</font>

697
00:29:53,970 --> 00:29:56,760
is not the<font color="#CCCCCC"> only source of data that you</font>

698
00:29:55,679 --> 00:29:58,260
can use if you're trying to optimize

699
00:29:56,760 --> 00:30:00,390
your decisions if you're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

700
00:29:58,260 --> 00:30:02,610
optimize your design the way you manage

701
00:30:00,390 --> 00:30:05,970
your systems or how you operate them

702
00:30:02,610 --> 00:30:07,918
internal data is the most useful because

703
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:10,110
it's the most telling about how your

704
00:30:07,919 --> 00:30:12,210
system is operating but you can of

705
00:30:10,110 --> 00:30:15,658
course<font color="#E5E5E5"> go external and get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> information</font>

706
00:30:12,210 --> 00:30:16,530
have any of you tried to go externally

00:30:15,659 --> 00:30:18,030
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get information</font>

708
00:30:16,530 --> 00:30:20,010
to help you improve your decisions that

709
00:30:18,030 --> 00:30:24,300
or your design of<font color="#E5E5E5"> your systems</font>

internally<font color="#CCCCCC"> yes-ish folks have so the the</font>

711
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:28,409
the interesting thing about that is it's

712
00:30:26,550 --> 00:30:30,750
very<font color="#CCCCCC"> useful to help you understand your</font>

713
00:30:28,410 --> 00:30:34,650
performance in the context of others for

714
00:30:30,750 --> 00:30:37,290
example benchmarking however you can

715
00:30:34,650 --> 00:30:39,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">also incorporate them more directly into</font>

716
00:30:37,290 --> 00:30:42,600
things like operations you just have to

717
00:30:39,690 --> 00:30:44,490
convert<font color="#CCCCCC"> the data into something that</font>

718

sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of aligns with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your existing data</font>

719

726
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:08,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think this quote is kind of important</font>

727
00:31:03,630 --> 00:31:12,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">for information security folks there's a</font>

728
00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:16,320
there's a story about some philosophers

729
00:31:12,390 --> 00:31:18,270
or statisticians who were told to go

730
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:20,040
look for<font color="#CCCCCC"> some keys that had been lost in</font>

731
00:31:18,270 --> 00:31:22,200
a parking lot and someone walking by

732
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:24,960
noticed that this<font color="#E5E5E5"> guy was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> walking around</font>

733
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:26,340
in circles under a lamp post it was

734
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:27,570
really dark gallon but he was really

735
00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:29,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">looking for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that keys but he's just</font>

736
00:31:27,570 --> 00:31:32,100
going around and around and someone said

737
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:33,540
why are<font color="#E5E5E5"> you only looking in this one</font>

738
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:36,209
spot he's like oh well this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the only</font>

739
00:31:33,540 --> 00:31:39,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">place where I can see the ground and so</font>

740
00:31:36,210 --> 00:31:42,810
when we communicate as security or risk

741
00:31:39,630 --> 00:31:47,220
professionals back up to management the

742
00:31:42,810 --> 00:31:50,070
management needs to have data that or

743
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:53,010
needs to have did expressed in ways that

744
00:31:50,070 --> 00:31:55,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">that are quantifiable and feel really</font>

745
00:31:53,010 --> 00:31:59,070
real to them and so I think it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> useful</font>

746
00:31:55,830 --> 00:32:02,639
<font color="#CCCCCC">for us to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> consider new models and new</font>

747
00:31:59,070 --> 00:32:06,389
approaches simply<font color="#E5E5E5"> because at the</font>

748
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:11,190
communication gap between assessment and

749
00:32:06,390 --> 00:32:13,290
defense is there's a communication gap

750
00:32:11,190 --> 00:32:15,390
as well as a sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of an operational gap</font>

751
00:32:13,290 --> 00:32:17,100
between assessment and defense<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the</font>

752
00:32:15,390 --> 00:32:18,900
better<font color="#E5E5E5"> we are able to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> communicate and</font>

753
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:20,760
use numbers and use the language of

successful<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the risk management</font>

756
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:27,780
programs that we put into place so if

757
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:29,100
you harvest your internal systems and

758
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:30,780
use the data that

759
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:33,240
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> there from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all the feedback loops</font>

760
00:32:30,780 --> 00:32:36,149
that is one place to get data but where

00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:48,660
else can you get data Alex<font color="#CCCCCC"> time do you</font>

00:32:36,150 --> 00:32:50,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">have any ideas all right so while I'm</font>

763
00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:53,610
transitioning here I just want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to come</font>

764
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:54,929
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> a couple of concepts of what of</font>

back your mind for a second first is

767
00:32:56,640 --> 00:33:03,390
patterns right I talked<font color="#CCCCCC"> about how in</font>

terms of risk manage risk modeling and

769
00:33:03,390 --> 00:33:08,820
if we<font color="#CCCCCC"> are a complex</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> system you can only</font>

770
00:33:06,510 --> 00:33:12,150
look in discern<font color="#CCCCCC"> patterns which is a lot</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">of what she was talking about and so</font>

772
00:33:12,150 --> 00:33:16,919
hold that one in the back your mind what

773
00:33:14,490 --> 00:33:19,409
I want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to ask</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you now though is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

774
00:33:16,919 --> 00:33:21,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">right so I've put forth you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

775
00:33:19,409 --> 00:33:24,510
you know governance is really just risk

776
00:33:21,330 --> 00:33:25,770
management that governance is what we

777
00:33:24,510 --> 00:33:26,820
think of as governance now in

778
00:33:25,770 --> 00:33:30,360
information security is fairly

779
00:33:26,820 --> 00:33:33,330
fabricated probably by vendors the

00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:36,000
second thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> being our risk modeling is</font>

781
00:33:33,330 --> 00:33:38,039
really terrible at times impossible you

782
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:41,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">know that it completely uninformative</font>

783
00:33:38,039 --> 00:33:44,760
even when we do a<font color="#CCCCCC"> good job in predicting</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">and predictive analytics what is the</font>

us a little bit of insight<font color="#CCCCCC"> into that</font>

788

it's actually talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the systems</font>

first the bad guy did this then that

00:34:33,750 --> 00:34:37,859
then the other thing sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> like what</font>

to actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> turn those into metrics and</font>

810
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:51,989
what we<font color="#E5E5E5"> created was a framework for this</font>

it's called<font color="#E5E5E5"> veras and it's open it's as</font>

story of what the incident consisted of

847

854
00:36:46,740 --> 00:36:50,520
you take all that<font color="#E5E5E5"> information together</font>

855

and suddenly you have

<font color="#E5E5E5">can start comparing each failure</font>

00:37:08,250 --> 00:37:15,930
hey be there was extremely similar to<font color="#E5E5E5"> e</font>

00:37:12,510 --> 00:37:19,080
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can look for patterns that are that</font>

that match specific demographic pieces

00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:28,500
and specific small threat pieces so what

866
00:37:26,730 --> 00:37:30,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">does</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it mean to be post GRC in the</font>

868
00:37:30,870 --> 00:37:36,060
is evidence it's evidence of what went

869
00:37:33,210 --> 00:37:40,050
wrong if anybody familiar with the term

870
00:37:36,060 --> 00:37:43,200
evidence-based medicine here I go one or

871
00:37:40,050 --> 00:37:45,570
two<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right so evidence-based medicine</font>

saying<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay well we're going to have</font>

874
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:50,190
scientific studies on what works and

875
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:54,990
what doesn't and what we<font color="#E5E5E5"> are going to</font>

876
00:37:50,190 --> 00:37:58,470
prescribe as a doctor is what works best

877
00:37:54,990 --> 00:38:01,649
evidence-based risk management would

878
00:37:58,470 --> 00:38:05,339
therefore be a<font color="#E5E5E5"> SISO saying hey I'm going</font>

00:38:01,650 --> 00:38:07,350

881
00:38:07,350 --> 00:38:16,290
suck these are expressed basically by

882
00:38:13,140 --> 00:38:17,730
models that we talked about I want to

883
00:38:16,290 --> 00:38:21,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">give</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you a real world example bio</font>

886
00:38:23,310 --> 00:38:27,630
are actually is actually the

00:38:25,350 --> 00:38:29,819
entanglement of multiple complex systems

888
00:38:27,630 --> 00:38:31,590
you've got problems you've got a lot of

00:38:29,820 --> 00:38:33,690
data that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> need to process you've got</font>

891
00:38:33,690 --> 00:38:37,020
what's interesting is is we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> been</font>

892
00:38:35,850 --> 00:38:38,100
sitting<font color="#E5E5E5"> here and we've been talking</font>

893
00:38:37,020 --> 00:38:40,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">about models been talking about</font>

894
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:42,690
statistics we've made allusions to

895
00:38:40,470 --> 00:38:45,299
philosophers and so forth very highly

896
00:38:42,690 --> 00:38:46,770
academic you'll forgive us<font color="#E5E5E5"> for that but</font>

897
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:48,930
I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> you to know this is not an</font>

898
00:38:46,770 --> 00:38:50,700
academic pursuit first off I've been

899
00:38:48,930 --> 00:38:52,440
I've been preaching the concept of data

900
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:54,270
warehousing and business intelligence

901
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:56,550
for use in security for several years

902
00:38:54,270 --> 00:38:57,690
now Gartner finally issued a report and

903
00:38:56,550 --> 00:39:00,000
said hey this was going to be a big

904
00:38:57,690 --> 00:39:01,830
trend over the next five years<font color="#E5E5E5"> to that</font>

905
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:03,820
extent I don't know of a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of people</font>

906
00:39:01,830 --> 00:39:05,950
doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> it but the ones i dunno in</font>

907
00:39:03,820 --> 00:39:09,460
all the large financial institution who

908
00:39:05,950 --> 00:39:11,649
has 50 terabytes of data from 60

909
00:39:09,460 --> 00:39:14,140
different data sources he's actually

910
00:39:11,650 --> 00:39:17,050
preventing<font color="#E5E5E5"> Zeus infections and</font>

911
00:39:14,140 --> 00:39:18,879
fraudulent ACH transfers by doing

912
00:39:17,050 --> 00:39:22,240
exactly what we're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to tell you</font>

913
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:24,370
about here today he's throwing away risk

914
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:25,810
modeling as I've got I'm going to go

915
00:39:24,370 --> 00:39:27,430
look<font color="#CCCCCC"> at my enterprise I'm going to do a</font>

916
00:39:25,810 --> 00:39:28,720
vulnerability assessment I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

917
00:39:27,430 --> 00:39:31,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">try and figure out how bad all these</font>

918
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:33,850
things are he's instead having his risk

919
00:39:31,390 --> 00:39:37,960
analysts integrate with operations and

920
00:39:33,850 --> 00:39:39,970
actually spun processes that say<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh this</font>

921
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:43,390
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not an ACH transfer that's going</font>

922
00:39:39,970 --> 00:39:46,689
<font color="#CCCCCC">through so he actually is actually that</font>

923
00:39:43,390 --> 00:39:50,410
that specific organization is actually

924
00:39:46,690 --> 00:39:52,960
going to spool up to 110 different data

925
00:39:50,410 --> 00:39:55,149
sources and over 100 terabytes of

926
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:57,880
information and some<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of Hadoop</font>

927
00:39:55,150 --> 00:40:01,870
installation that I really need to learn

928
00:39:57,880 --> 00:40:03,790
about and basically it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just this</font>

929
00:40:01,870 --> 00:40:05,980
information back to that that

930
00:40:03,790 --> 00:40:07,750
deceptively simple Venn diagram that I

931
00:40:05,980 --> 00:40:10,510
gave you in the census<font color="#CCCCCC"> of that</font>

932
00:40:07,750 --> 00:40:12,310
information so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> talking about</font>

933
00:40:10,510 --> 00:40:14,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">the future if we're if we're going to</font>

934
00:40:12,310 --> 00:40:16,450
throw<font color="#E5E5E5"> off GRC and say you know what this</font>

935
00:40:14,470 --> 00:40:18,250
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't make any sense at all talk</font>

936
00:40:16,450 --> 00:40:21,669
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> the future this is what the future</font>

937
00:40:18,250 --> 00:40:24,490
of risk analytics is its integration

938
00:40:21,670 --> 00:40:26,860
with operational security and actual

939
00:40:24,490 --> 00:40:32,620
defense not in the actual answering to

940
00:40:26,860 --> 00:40:35,170
IT audits and external auditors so that

941
00:40:32,620 --> 00:40:37,240
leaves one problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that problem is</font>

942
00:40:35,170 --> 00:40:38,620
this the data owners themselves the

943
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:40,810
people that we report to they really

944
00:40:38,620 --> 00:40:42,940
like these stop lights they really<font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font>

945
00:40:40,810 --> 00:40:44,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">these individual points statement that</font>

946
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:47,260
we're asserting we can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really do and</font>

947
00:40:44,830 --> 00:40:48,819
so forth they like the reporting and so

948
00:40:47,260 --> 00:40:51,460
one of the things I'm trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to wrap my</font>

949
00:40:48,820 --> 00:40:56,380
mind around is how do we report this and

950
00:40:51,460 --> 00:40:58,690
what I wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to actually talk about is</font>

951
00:40:56,380 --> 00:41:00,790
drawing a lesson from something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

952
00:40:58,690 --> 00:41:04,690
might be familiar to some of you this is

953
00:41:00,790 --> 00:41:07,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">Hosea cardinel this is his 1978 Phillies</font>

954
00:41:04,690 --> 00:41:09,700
card it's one of<font color="#CCCCCC"> my favorite cards for</font>

955
00:41:07,510 --> 00:41:11,710
obvious reasons but if you look<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the</font>

956
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:13,120
back and<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a yogi berra card what</font>

957
00:41:11,710 --> 00:41:15,580
they're actually giving you as a

958
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:16,839
dashboard right you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think of it</font>

959
00:41:15,580 --> 00:41:17,590
back of a baseball<font color="#E5E5E5"> card as a dashboard</font>

960
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:19,600
but it is

961
00:41:17,590 --> 00:41:22,090
and here you have an old Yogi Berra card

962
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:23,830
and you have basic information that

963
00:41:22,090 --> 00:41:27,340
tells you what kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of baseball player</font>

964
00:41:23,830 --> 00:41:29,740
Yogi Berra is right as we got a little

965
00:41:27,340 --> 00:41:32,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">more sophisticated now you see</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

966
00:41:29,740 --> 00:41:34,629
there are many more statistics and so

967
00:41:32,290 --> 00:41:36,160
you can look at games and at-bats and

968
00:41:34,630 --> 00:41:38,350
can tell if he's a full-time player you

969
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:40,330
can compare that in terms of games and

970
00:41:38,350 --> 00:41:42,100
say<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay now he's not only a full-time</font>

971
00:41:40,330 --> 00:41:44,290
player but over the course of his

972
00:41:42,100 --> 00:41:47,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">history and you know we don't have</font>

973
00:41:44,290 --> 00:41:49,779
history on yogi there right he's he

974
00:41:47,230 --> 00:41:51,490
plays a bunch he's always been a starter

975
00:41:49,780 --> 00:41:53,440
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> he does get hurt often and he has</font>

976
00:41:51,490 --> 00:41:55,629
some level<font color="#E5E5E5"> of power his some level of</font>

977
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:57,970
strike out there some level of all of

978
00:41:55,630 --> 00:42:00,310
these things and I'm sorry<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

979
00:41:57,970 --> 00:42:01,779
came out blurry a bit but<font color="#E5E5E5"> when you talk</font>

980
00:42:00,310 --> 00:42:03,279
about Barry Bonds now we have a very

981
00:42:01,780 --> 00:42:08,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">sophisticated history are very</font>

982
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:09,820
sophisticated a set of attributions

983
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:12,490
about what kind of baseball<font color="#E5E5E5"> player he</font>

984
00:42:09,820 --> 00:42:14,440
was and the red bits there if he can

985
00:42:12,490 --> 00:42:16,060
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> barely pick those out that's where</font>

986
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:17,740
he led the league so now you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

987
00:42:16,060 --> 00:42:22,270
new thing called comparative analytics

988
00:42:17,740 --> 00:42:24,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">verizon's got 900 good confident set of</font>

989
00:42:22,270 --> 00:42:26,380
analytics for folks to compare against

990
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:29,049
that we have released and<font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll continue</font>

991
00:42:26,380 --> 00:42:31,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">to work on in releasing and in a</font>

992
00:42:29,050 --> 00:42:33,700
framework<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you can take and apply at</font>

993
00:42:31,210 --> 00:42:35,410
home<font color="#E5E5E5"> absolutely free there's a wiki go</font>

994
00:42:33,700 --> 00:42:40,000
use it knock yourself out we don't care

995
00:42:35,410 --> 00:42:45,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">all right so if we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have the ability to</font>

996
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:48,010
try and say here's a notion of what kind

997
00:42:45,580 --> 00:42:51,130
of good baseball player Barry Bonds may

998
00:42:48,010 --> 00:42:54,550
or may not be<font color="#E5E5E5"> how can we do that for</font>

999
00:42:51,130 --> 00:42:58,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">these and my assertion is this</font>

1000
00:42:54,550 --> 00:43:00,190
deconstruct it<font color="#E5E5E5"> I borrowed the concept of</font>

1001
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:02,260
balanced scorecard I was inspired<font color="#E5E5E5"> again</font>

1002
00:43:00,190 --> 00:43:04,360
by Andrew J queef and his book on

1003
00:43:02,260 --> 00:43:05,980
security metrics but<font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't think the</font>

1004
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:07,840
balanced scorecard that we should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

1005
00:43:05,980 --> 00:43:09,340
applying at least initially to

1006
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:11,470
understand whether or not<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're doing a</font>

00:43:09,340 --> 00:43:14,230

you find in a regular balanced scorecard

1034

1035
00:44:21,880 --> 00:44:26,950
that the post GRC world will be ushered

1036

1040
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:45,910
the enterprise it's very pragmatic

00:44:41,050 --> 00:44:48,010
second reporting becomes something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

1042
00:44:45,910 --> 00:44:50,710
we do by measuring a lot of things in

why we if you take that that baseball

1052
00:45:09,010 --> 00:45:12,970
good if he's bad or what have you until

1053
00:45:11,020 --> 00:45:15,190
i<font color="#E5E5E5"> can compare him against a significant</font>

he's better than these five guys he's

1059
00:45:24,520 --> 00:45:32,050
future of GRC is it's basically

models any question

1063
00:45:41,770 --> 00:45:47,020
I have a question yeah so the virus

1064
00:45:45,340 --> 00:45:48,670
right this<font color="#E5E5E5"> isn't a trick this wasn't</font>

1065
00:45:47,020 --> 00:45:51,100
planned<font color="#E5E5E5"> advance I just as he</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was talking</font>

1066
00:45:48,670 --> 00:45:53,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">about so the varus framework I get that</font>

1067
00:45:51,100 --> 00:45:55,420
it's pretty freaking cool you could

1068
00:45:53,020 --> 00:45:59,230
profile an organization based on some

1069
00:45:55,420 --> 00:46:01,930
identifiers about it and sort of

1070
00:45:59,230 --> 00:46:04,630
determine its expected performance based

1071
00:46:01,930 --> 00:46:08,919
on comparing it to a peer group right

1072
00:46:04,630 --> 00:46:13,030
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> how then you go</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay well go back to</font>

1073
00:46:08,920 --> 00:46:14,380
the can we go back to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the slides so it</font>

1074
00:46:13,030 --> 00:46:15,730
looked like you're essentially

1075
00:46:14,380 --> 00:46:18,340
collecting attributes on different

1076
00:46:15,730 --> 00:46:20,680
organizations and their performance

1077
00:46:18,340 --> 00:46:23,200
based on incidence theta experience

1078
00:46:20,680 --> 00:46:25,660
which is essentially how you you know

1079
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:29,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">you would have different we would have</font>

1080
00:46:25,660 --> 00:46:31,839
controls for different types of risk

1081
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:35,140
manifestations and you can then sort of

1082
00:46:31,840 --> 00:46:37,000
determine you know a<font color="#E5E5E5"> different company</font>

1083
00:46:35,140 --> 00:46:38,980
that you don't have data on yet but<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1084
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:41,650
has certain attributes you might expect

1085
00:46:38,980 --> 00:46:43,990
it to perform you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know how it might</font>

1086
00:46:41,650 --> 00:46:45,520
perform relative to a peer group which

1087
00:46:43,990 --> 00:46:47,439
you then you know shown what the

1088
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:49,450
performance of the peer group is that's

1089
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:50,740
useful for you is the new organization

1090
00:46:49,450 --> 00:46:53,620
you say<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay compared to other</font>

1091
00:46:50,740 --> 00:46:56,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">organizations in my fighting weight I</font>

1092
00:46:53,620 --> 00:46:58,240
can expect this kind of knockout I can

1093
00:46:56,290 --> 00:47:01,779
expect<font color="#E5E5E5"> to last this many rounds in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1094
00:46:58,240 --> 00:47:04,149
fight so that's great and that helps you

1095
00:47:01,780 --> 00:47:06,580
maybe quantify your exposure but then

1096
00:47:04,150 --> 00:47:08,620
how does that just do you have

1097
00:47:06,580 --> 00:47:11,020
information<font color="#E5E5E5"> in there that that would</font>

1098
00:47:08,620 --> 00:47:12,700
help an organization figure out where

1099
00:47:11,020 --> 00:47:14,920
they need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to focus in order to improve</font>

1100
00:47:12,700 --> 00:47:17,470
their defenses do you have the sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

1101
00:47:14,920 --> 00:47:20,620
proactive information as well<font color="#CCCCCC"> as the</font>

1102
00:47:17,470 --> 00:47:23,620
incident information because each of

1103
00:47:20,620 --> 00:47:26,109
these represents a sense because each of

1104
00:47:23,620 --> 00:47:28,600
these represents a failure okay we act

1105
00:47:26,110 --> 00:47:34,390
that they actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would think would</font>

1106
00:47:28,600 --> 00:47:38,710
be real right so in fact in terms of

1107
00:47:34,390 --> 00:47:40,660
actual performance metrics anybody in an

1108
00:47:38,710 --> 00:47:43,270
organization that gets those penetration

1109
00:47:40,660 --> 00:47:49,330
testing or gets their systems tested

1110
00:47:43,270 --> 00:47:52,049
regularly handful folks okay<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll ask</font>

1111
00:47:49,330 --> 00:47:59,279
what is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the benefit for you of a</font>

1112
00:47:52,049 --> 00:48:00,779
scary management well<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah I mean really</font>

1113
00:47:59,279 --> 00:48:07,769
you get this route you<font color="#E5E5E5"> get a report back</font>

1114
00:48:00,779 --> 00:48:11,369
what does<font color="#E5E5E5"> that mean to you good to you</font>

1115
00:48:07,769 --> 00:48:14,129
said ometer how not now what I used to<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1116
00:48:11,369 --> 00:48:16,079
used to work with a pen test team and we

1117
00:48:14,130 --> 00:48:18,299
used to express things in sort of well

1118
00:48:16,079 --> 00:48:20,849
there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> only so many so much we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can do</font>

1119
00:48:18,299 --> 00:48:24,089
in a month right we usually scope out by

1120
00:48:20,849 --> 00:48:27,209
month do you<font color="#CCCCCC"> want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> us to go wide or deep</font>

1121
00:48:24,089 --> 00:48:30,390
and and how do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> measure how do you</font>

1122
00:48:27,209 --> 00:48:32,759
balance that depth versus with and if I

1123
00:48:30,390 --> 00:48:35,189
if it takes me a couple weeks<font color="#E5E5E5"> to break</font>

1124
00:48:32,759 --> 00:48:39,029
in right and actually get<font color="#E5E5E5"> to my goal</font>

1125
00:48:35,189 --> 00:48:42,118
right I've only proven one<font color="#E5E5E5"> entry way</font>

1126
00:48:39,029 --> 00:48:44,699
into your organization right so here's

1127
00:48:42,119 --> 00:48:47,160
what I would I've always always thought

1128
00:48:44,699 --> 00:48:48,989
<font color="#CCCCCC">of and getting</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> back to your to answering</font>

1129
00:48:47,160 --> 00:48:50,519
<font color="#CCCCCC">your question one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the things and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

1130
00:48:48,989 --> 00:48:53,459
don't steps here but one of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the things</font>

1131
00:48:50,519 --> 00:48:54,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">that I would assert is if you did it pit</font>

1132
00:48:53,459 --> 00:48:58,890
and this is one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the things</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I hope to</font>

1133
00:48:54,689 --> 00:49:01,828
do with verizon is if you do perform a

1134
00:48:58,890 --> 00:49:04,379
penetration test right I can I can<font color="#CCCCCC"> model</font>

1135
00:49:01,829 --> 00:49:06,269
<font color="#CCCCCC">that I can take the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> various object model</font>

1136
00:49:04,380 --> 00:49:08,069
the attack model and I can say well

1137
00:49:06,269 --> 00:49:09,660
first the pen team just this then they

1138
00:49:08,069 --> 00:49:12,989
did that then they did this they did and

1139
00:49:09,660 --> 00:49:14,489
they got a goal now I've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> 900 cases</font>

1140
00:49:12,989 --> 00:49:16,170
hopefully that's going to grow

1141
00:49:14,489 --> 00:49:18,539
exponentially over the next couple of

1142
00:49:16,170 --> 00:49:22,170
years that I can say oh you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know what</font>

1143
00:49:18,539 --> 00:49:24,719
your pen test was exactly like these 15

1144
00:49:22,170 --> 00:49:26,670
incidents those 15 incidents<font color="#CCCCCC"> cost this</font>

1145
00:49:24,719 --> 00:49:28,439
much money now you have a much more

1146
00:49:26,670 --> 00:49:29,789
informative pen test versus<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay go</font>

1147
00:49:28,439 --> 00:49:32,038
patch these things and hope that the

1148
00:49:29,789 --> 00:49:34,319
vendor doesn't get screwed next month

1149
00:49:32,039 --> 00:49:35,489
and have another vulnerability we're

1150
00:49:34,319 --> 00:49:37,799
just going to patch it over<font color="#CCCCCC"> again</font>

1151
00:49:35,489 --> 00:49:40,499
honestly I'll tell you what after five

1152
00:49:37,799 --> 00:49:42,599
years of working with a pen test team it

1153
00:49:40,499 --> 00:49:44,999
<font color="#E5E5E5">really became fine you know find the</font>

1154
00:49:42,599 --> 00:49:47,699
blank sa password and this was you know

1155
00:49:44,999 --> 00:49:50,189
2000-2005 things are a little different

1156
00:49:47,699 --> 00:49:53,160
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know it really was just this</font>

1157
00:49:50,189 --> 00:49:54,660
very fairly repetitive exercise and what

1158
00:49:53,160 --> 00:49:57,689
I really think is that we should<font color="#CCCCCC"> do</font>

1159
00:49:54,660 --> 00:50:02,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">lightweight very focused pen test based</font>

1160
00:49:57,689 --> 00:50:04,348
on the patterns<font color="#CCCCCC"> that were most concerned</font>

1161
00:50:02,130 --> 00:50:05,819
of the patterns<font color="#CCCCCC"> that show up</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the most</font>

1162
00:50:04,349 --> 00:50:07,979
the patterns<font color="#E5E5E5"> that directly</font>

1163
00:50:05,819 --> 00:50:12,390
relate<font color="#CCCCCC"> to specific impacts that were</font>

1164
00:50:07,979 --> 00:50:13,828
were concerned again and then when you

1165
00:50:12,390 --> 00:50:16,348
think about prevent detect and respond

1166
00:50:13,829 --> 00:50:18,959
right in our ability to do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font>

1167
00:50:16,349 --> 00:50:22,739
<font color="#CCCCCC">in terms of feeding operational metrics</font>

1168
00:50:18,959 --> 00:50:24,538
back into what we can expect in terms of

1169
00:50:22,739 --> 00:50:27,900
performance into a Business Intelligence

1170
00:50:24,539 --> 00:50:29,699
Platform we can take a<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at the</font>

1171
00:50:27,900 --> 00:50:31,709
metrics that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> describe at a discovery</font>

1172
00:50:29,699 --> 00:50:33,869
and mitigation if we truly do red team

1173
00:50:31,709 --> 00:50:35,910
i'm now not a believer at all in blue

1174
00:50:33,869 --> 00:50:38,609
team exercises by the way for this

1175
00:50:35,910 --> 00:50:40,288
reason but<font color="#CCCCCC"> i can get performance</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> metrics</font>

1176
00:50:38,609 --> 00:50:42,449
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i can see if I'm hitting the home</font>

1177
00:50:40,289 --> 00:50:44,999
runs I can see if I'm batting my batting

1178
00:50:42,449 --> 00:50:47,699
average is good especially if now I've

1179
00:50:44,999 --> 00:50:49,919
got a thousand other penetration test

1180
00:50:47,699 --> 00:50:52,499
results from different organizations may

1181
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:54,719
be similar maybe uh not so similar and I

1182
00:50:52,499 --> 00:50:56,910
can benchmark myself against that so

1183
00:50:54,719 --> 00:50:58,769
that that a long way to answer<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

1184
00:50:56,910 --> 00:51:01,890
question but I really do believe that

1185
00:50:58,769 --> 00:51:03,328
that and I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not just not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Varys right</font>

1186
00:51:01,890 --> 00:51:06,839
you can you guys can build models

1187
00:51:03,329 --> 00:51:08,789
yourself it's really you know something

1188
00:51:06,839 --> 00:51:11,430
that that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is kind of enjoyable once you</font>

1189
00:51:08,789 --> 00:51:14,009
get into it but you can certainly do

1190
00:51:11,430 --> 00:51:15,868
this you just have to understand that

1191
00:51:14,009 --> 00:51:17,609
compared to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the analytics is key and to</font>

1192
00:51:15,869 --> 00:51:19,499
some extent the ice axe are trying to do

1193
00:51:17,609 --> 00:51:23,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">this right anybody familiar with the ice</font>

1194
00:51:19,499 --> 00:51:25,259
axe yes no they're just groups of

1195
00:51:23,609 --> 00:51:27,869
security folks so you get together and

1196
00:51:25,259 --> 00:51:29,519
talk high level but the ice axe are

1197
00:51:27,869 --> 00:51:31,410
trying to do this and there are plenty

1198
00:51:29,519 --> 00:51:35,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">of groups that are trying to do that so</font>

1199
00:51:31,410 --> 00:51:37,529
anyway<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I answer your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> question in</font>

1200
00:51:35,430 --> 00:51:40,348
that rambling sorry ya know you did it's

1201
00:51:37,529 --> 00:51:42,150
it basically it's um you would take the

1202
00:51:40,349 --> 00:51:46,289
results and then you can sort of tailor

1203
00:51:42,150 --> 00:51:49,109
your defense plan to what didn't work

1204
00:51:46,289 --> 00:51:52,440
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> others or I mean</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you can you can</font>

1205
00:51:49,109 --> 00:51:54,269
emphasize the threats that manifested

1206
00:51:52,440 --> 00:51:57,390
for other organizations similar to yours

1207
00:51:54,269 --> 00:51:59,160
it helps you prioritize<font color="#CCCCCC"> your plans sure</font>

1208
00:51:57,390 --> 00:52:02,430
and we and we might say<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we know</font>

1209
00:51:59,160 --> 00:52:05,098
<font color="#E5E5E5">that the numbering breaks down here but</font>

1210
00:52:02,430 --> 00:52:07,469
we might say<font color="#CCCCCC"> one two and three we know</font>

1211
00:52:05,099 --> 00:52:08,819
that what we're concerned about right

1212
00:52:07,469 --> 00:52:10,259
we're susceptible to maybe that's what

1213
00:52:08,819 --> 00:52:11,910
came up penetration<font color="#E5E5E5"> to us or what have</font>

1214
00:52:10,259 --> 00:52:14,579
you or<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe that's what we're seeing</font>

1215
00:52:11,910 --> 00:52:15,989
now as a result of sucking in all of

1216
00:52:14,579 --> 00:52:18,539
this information into a data warehouse

1217
00:52:15,989 --> 00:52:19,400
right well if we know that we can see

1218
00:52:18,539 --> 00:52:22,730
that pattern 12

1219
00:52:19,400 --> 00:52:26,150
three and then we have a fourth event

1220
00:52:22,730 --> 00:52:29,029
that typically happens well now we

1221
00:52:26,150 --> 00:52:31,339
should<font color="#E5E5E5"> go say up now we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can't have if</font>

1222
00:52:29,029 --> 00:52:33,020
you remember me saying so you know some

1223
00:52:31,339 --> 00:52:35,240
analysts jump up out of the cube and run

1224
00:52:33,020 --> 00:52:39,079
down to the sock going wow you know

1225
00:52:35,240 --> 00:52:42,649
watch out right in you know out of<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

1226
00:52:39,079 --> 00:52:45,260
know 10,000<font color="#E5E5E5"> different you know instances</font>

1227
00:52:42,650 --> 00:52:46,940
I ran a hundred thousand simulations in

1228
00:52:45,260 --> 00:52:49,940
two-tenths of a second<font color="#E5E5E5"> and by golly</font>

1229
00:52:46,940 --> 00:52:51,500
forty percent of the time we saw number

1230
00:52:49,940 --> 00:52:59,289
four come up and we've got a number for

1231
00:52:51,500 --> 00:52:59,289
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that means bad yes sir</font>

1232
00:53:20,720 --> 00:53:26,450
yeah and then really what you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking</font>

1233
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:28,910
about is is you know kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of data</font>

1234
00:53:26,450 --> 00:53:31,339
obsolescence and there are<font color="#CCCCCC"> certainly</font>

1235
00:53:28,910 --> 00:53:34,220
plenty of Social Sciences as plenty of

1236
00:53:31,340 --> 00:53:37,130
teachers in that regard about how you

1237
00:53:34,220 --> 00:53:39,259
might apply that it's not perfect again

1238
00:53:37,130 --> 00:53:40,790
all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of these models are just hypotheses</font>

1239
00:53:39,260 --> 00:53:44,240
and they<font color="#CCCCCC"> always are constantly getting</font>

1240
00:53:40,790 --> 00:53:47,869
falsified are should be as well good

1241
00:53:44,240 --> 00:53:49,939
yeah so models regularly degrade that's

1242
00:53:47,869 --> 00:53:53,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">absolutely true it's part of why it's</font>

1243
00:53:49,940 --> 00:53:55,670
important to continue to have feedback

1244
00:53:53,300 --> 00:53:58,010
loops to let to keep you understanding

1245
00:53:55,670 --> 00:53:59,780
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> your performances and then you go</font>

1246
00:53:58,010 --> 00:54:03,320
back<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you retrain your models based</font>

1247
00:53:59,780 --> 00:54:05,960
on fresher data I mean it doesn't stop

1248
00:54:03,320 --> 00:54:07,580
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of like virus software you</font>

1249
00:54:05,960 --> 00:54:09,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">have to keep updating it because yours</font>

1250
00:54:07,580 --> 00:54:11,390
you know new signatures come out you

1251
00:54:09,500 --> 00:54:13,430
need new signature files or whatever

1252
00:54:11,390 --> 00:54:16,000
here at six your virus scanning engine

1253
00:54:13,430 --> 00:54:16,000
is using

1254
00:54:19,150 --> 00:54:30,190
yep you can retire our old data you can

1255
00:54:27,670 --> 00:54:32,530
retire old cases or you can you can

1256
00:54:30,190 --> 00:54:33,640
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> factor that into the equations</font>

1257
00:54:32,530 --> 00:54:36,040
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> come out of the modeling exercise</font>

1258
00:54:33,640 --> 00:54:38,500
if you've actually got like<font color="#CCCCCC"> a real like</font>

1259
00:54:36,040 --> 00:54:40,240
statistical model you can actually decay

1260
00:54:38,500 --> 00:54:43,510
the variables associated with older data

1261
00:54:40,240 --> 00:54:45,490
so that it has less weight associated

1262
00:54:43,510 --> 00:54:46,870
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> that that's a pretty common</font>

1263
00:54:45,490 --> 00:54:49,209
technique to have sort of decay

1264
00:54:46,870 --> 00:54:53,170
variables and then it<font color="#CCCCCC"> just decays out of</font>

1265
00:54:49,210 --> 00:54:58,210
your out of your sample set yeah

1266
00:54:53,170 --> 00:54:59,830
absolutely that's why modeling is an

1267
00:54:58,210 --> 00:55:01,630
iterative exercise so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you can</font>

1268
00:54:59,830 --> 00:55:03,490
always figure out<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know these</font>

1269
00:55:01,630 --> 00:55:05,200
variables are decaying faster than this

1270
00:55:03,490 --> 00:55:10,029
variable so they need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be retired</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> up</font>

1271
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:12,430
faster well complet it can be complex it

1272
00:55:10,030 --> 00:55:15,670
may be it may be simpler we<font color="#E5E5E5"> just don't</font>

1273
00:55:12,430 --> 00:55:17,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> yet then we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think I was trying to</font>

1274
00:55:15,670 --> 00:55:19,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">get it up on the screen but in the in</font>

1275
00:55:17,620 --> 00:55:23,890
this year's data breach report on page

1276
00:55:19,210 --> 00:55:27,220
21 we're showing it shows basically the

1277
00:55:23,890 --> 00:55:28,930
varus threat actions and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're at a</font>

1278
00:55:27,220 --> 00:55:31,029
high level<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're malware they're</font>

1279
00:55:28,930 --> 00:55:33,100
hacking their social there's misuse

1280
00:55:31,030 --> 00:55:34,960
there's physical there's air and

1281
00:55:33,100 --> 00:55:36,460
environmental and it shows their changes

1282
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:38,440
over time and one of the cool things

1283
00:55:36,460 --> 00:55:42,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">over the last two years we've seen this</font>

1284
00:55:38,440 --> 00:55:44,200
huge spike in malware justjan<font color="#CCCCCC"> Ormus and</font>

1285
00:55:42,220 --> 00:55:46,480
so what you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do is you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have to</font>

1286
00:55:44,200 --> 00:55:49,899
see you have to see that<font color="#E5E5E5"> trend and make</font>

1287
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:52,570
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> decision we've got something happening</font>

1288
00:55:49,900 --> 00:55:56,020
over time does this mean that 2005

1289
00:55:52,570 --> 00:55:58,270
models the tax are informative or not

1290
00:55:56,020 --> 00:56:02,200
maybe they still are the other thing

1291
00:55:58,270 --> 00:56:06,700
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting is is i've been i've</font>

1292
00:56:02,200 --> 00:56:09,580
been in security since 94 95 and back

1293
00:56:06,700 --> 00:56:11,620
then a firewall was thought to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be it I</font>

1294
00:56:09,580 --> 00:56:14,770
that was my first job out of college was

1295
00:56:11,620 --> 00:56:16,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">to educate customers as why they needed</font>

1296
00:56:14,770 --> 00:56:18,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get rid</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of just the pack of filter on</font>

1297
00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:21,610
their routers and Biden's $50,000

1298
00:56:18,370 --> 00:56:27,339
gauntlets right I worked for<font color="#E5E5E5"> an ISP and</font>

1299
00:56:21,610 --> 00:56:29,320
at that point<font color="#E5E5E5"> that was the the gauntlet</font>

1300
00:56:27,340 --> 00:56:31,660
far was the creme de la creme of how you

1301
00:56:29,320 --> 00:56:32,270
defended your network but what<font color="#E5E5E5"> happens</font>

1302
00:56:31,660 --> 00:56:33,799
is over

1303
00:56:32,270 --> 00:56:36,259
time and you'll see this actually in

1304
00:56:33,800 --> 00:56:39,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">data from the data breach board not to</font>

1305
00:56:36,260 --> 00:56:43,220
keep bringing it up it supports this is

1306
00:56:39,710 --> 00:56:45,350
that we tend to create Maginot Line the

1307
00:56:43,220 --> 00:56:50,240
I obvious idea with firewalls is the

1308
00:56:45,350 --> 00:56:52,460
weld port 8443 now your firewall is neat

1309
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:54,229
that it blocks all these other<font color="#CCCCCC"> things if</font>

1310
00:56:52,460 --> 00:56:55,760
it's configured properly and if it

1311
00:56:54,230 --> 00:56:59,960
doesn't have vulnerabilities propping up

1312
00:56:55,760 --> 00:57:01,700
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> really you've just kind of these</font>

1313
00:56:59,960 --> 00:57:04,160
attacks<font color="#E5E5E5"> have gone from and if you think</font>

1314
00:57:01,700 --> 00:57:05,899
<font color="#CCCCCC">about it in a normal</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> distribution these</font>

1315
00:57:04,160 --> 00:57:08,720
attacks<font color="#E5E5E5"> have gone from being the most</font>

1316
00:57:05,900 --> 00:57:11,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">sophisticated attacks available to being</font>

1317
00:57:08,720 --> 00:57:14,540
just noise basically in your<font color="#CCCCCC"> logs right</font>

1318
00:57:11,990 --> 00:57:16,879
same<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> AV right we don't really</font>

1319
00:57:14,540 --> 00:57:19,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">worry about you know Code Red that much</font>

1320
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:20,810
anymore why because it became it had

1321
00:57:19,340 --> 00:57:22,790
this life span from being a very

1322
00:57:20,810 --> 00:57:25,310
sophisticated piece to being something

1323
00:57:22,790 --> 00:57:27,980
that AV generally picks up and helps us

1324
00:57:25,310 --> 00:57:31,040
detect and respond to<font color="#E5E5E5"> very quickly so</font>

1325
00:57:27,980 --> 00:57:32,660
one<font color="#E5E5E5"> other comment on the actually is</font>

1326
00:57:31,040 --> 00:57:34,040
that that there's a there's also a

1327
00:57:32,660 --> 00:57:36,859
problem with the reverse you can have

1328
00:57:34,040 --> 00:57:38,390
data that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is too new it has an age</font>

1329
00:57:36,860 --> 00:57:41,120
appropriate it's sort of there's sort of

1330
00:57:38,390 --> 00:57:43,759
a seasoning process if you will that you

1331
00:57:41,120 --> 00:57:46,759
can see sort of outlier data if the data

1332
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:48,380
is too new as well<font color="#E5E5E5"> so there's kind of a</font>

1333
00:57:46,760 --> 00:57:49,910
timing thing there that's why it's

1334
00:57:48,380 --> 00:57:54,860
important to sort of<font color="#CCCCCC"> weight your sample</font>

1335
00:57:49,910 --> 00:57:57,879
sets appropriately question<font color="#E5E5E5"> I choose for</font>

1336
00:57:54,860 --> 00:57:57,880
strike<font color="#CCCCCC"> yes</font>

1337
00:57:58,220 --> 00:58:06,189
no no no<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so</font>

1338
00:58:56,220 --> 00:59:05,910
right so that's that's why we release

1339
00:59:03,390 --> 00:59:08,009
the framework right<font color="#E5E5E5"> because we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> had that</font>

1340
00:59:05,910 --> 00:59:09,750
same problem right we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have any</font>

1341
00:59:08,010 --> 00:59:11,340
data but<font color="#CCCCCC"> we want data out of it we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want</font>

1342
00:59:09,750 --> 00:59:13,170
to do quant analysis you want to do

1343
00:59:11,340 --> 00:59:15,510
these<font color="#CCCCCC"> things right so the first thing</font>

1344
00:59:13,170 --> 00:59:17,550
was well how do we go get it right<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

1345
00:59:15,510 --> 00:59:20,250
that's what's cool about this year's

1346
00:59:17,550 --> 00:59:21,869
data breach report is is yeah there's

1347
00:59:20,250 --> 00:59:24,750
lots<font color="#E5E5E5"> of great stats I hope you read it I</font>

1348
00:59:21,869 --> 00:59:27,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">hope you love those things but to me as</font>

1349
00:59:24,750 --> 00:59:29,520
kind of a dork one of the coolest things

1350
00:59:27,090 --> 00:59:31,500
is we actually went<font color="#E5E5E5"> to a separate</font>

1351
00:59:29,520 --> 00:59:34,980
organization we gave them a framework

1352
00:59:31,500 --> 00:59:39,270
for which they could collect metrics

1353
00:59:34,980 --> 00:59:42,750
from you know basic analog experience

1354
00:59:39,270 --> 00:59:44,430
right and they<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually did</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it with a</font>

1355
00:59:42,750 --> 00:59:45,750
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit of training you know they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> had</font>

1356
00:59:44,430 --> 00:59:48,569
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> figure it out but they actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> did</font>

1357
00:59:45,750 --> 00:59:50,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">it so it what I would offer is what</font>

1358
00:59:48,570 --> 00:59:52,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">you're you're talking frustration and I</font>

1359
00:59:50,670 --> 00:59:55,260
feel it and you're talking frustration

1360
00:59:52,560 --> 00:59:57,960
or two things one models aren't helping

1361
00:59:55,260 --> 01:00:00,240
you get quant data right why because

1362
00:59:57,960 --> 01:00:01,740
it's well what's likely at iona ten

1363
01:00:00,240 --> 01:00:03,629
percent that sound good to<font color="#E5E5E5"> everybody in</font>

1364
01:00:01,740 --> 01:00:05,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">the room yeah it's ten percent great you</font>

1365
01:00:03,630 --> 01:00:08,190
have nothing there's no structure to get

1366
01:00:05,640 --> 01:00:11,730
you at that um there's a there's a basic

1367
01:00:08,190 --> 01:00:14,640
theorem and that says if there's a model

1368
01:00:11,730 --> 01:00:16,950
right and you and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I both are given that</font>

1369
01:00:14,640 --> 01:00:18,660
model the way to execute an outcome of

1370
01:00:16,950 --> 01:00:20,220
the model and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same data you should</font>

1371
01:00:18,660 --> 01:00:22,230
be able to go in<font color="#CCCCCC"> that room I should be</font>

1372
01:00:20,220 --> 01:00:23,609
in this room we should have cones of

1373
01:00:22,230 --> 01:00:26,369
silence and we should come out with

1374
01:00:23,609 --> 01:00:28,740
relatively similar results maybe our

1375
01:00:26,369 --> 01:00:30,869
monte carlo simulations will be slightly

1376
01:00:28,740 --> 01:00:33,689
different or whatever but we should have

1377
01:00:30,869 --> 01:00:35,790
relatively similar results there isn't

1378
01:00:33,690 --> 01:00:36,900
there are very few out let me<font color="#E5E5E5"> back off</font>

1379
01:00:35,790 --> 01:00:38,070
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> that because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I know a couple of</font>

1380
01:00:36,900 --> 01:00:39,930
people with good models but there are

1381
01:00:38,070 --> 01:00:41,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">very furious management programs that</font>

1382
01:00:39,930 --> 01:00:44,220
are that sophisticated yet and very very

1383
01:00:41,970 --> 01:00:47,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">very few models that you can do that</font>

1384
01:00:44,220 --> 01:00:50,700
with very<font color="#E5E5E5"> few so veras it was built now</font>

1385
01:00:47,760 --> 01:00:55,710
when I say it's freely available varus

1386
01:00:50,700 --> 01:01:00,000
framework dot wiki zoho com it's all

1387
01:00:55,710 --> 01:01:02,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">right there yeah it's linked all over</font>

1388
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:03,990
the all over the report in fact we<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk</font>

1389
01:01:02,520 --> 01:01:06,450
we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> little call outs and we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> talk</font>

1390
01:01:03,990 --> 01:01:09,508
about the data collection strategy and

1391
01:01:06,450 --> 01:01:11,609
so forth so you have a model problem

1392
01:01:09,509 --> 01:01:14,069
yeah but you also have the models also

1393
01:01:11,609 --> 01:01:16,919
<font color="#CCCCCC">giving contacts right so one of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1394
01:01:14,069 --> 01:01:19,529
reasons why we don't know<font color="#CCCCCC"> where to go</font>

1395
01:01:16,919 --> 01:01:22,739
because the models are ridiculous as

1396
01:01:19,529 --> 01:01:25,409
well so there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are several several</font>

1397
01:01:22,739 --> 01:01:27,599
problems and it just takes kind of

1398
01:01:25,409 --> 01:01:48,539
rational critical thinking<font color="#E5E5E5"> moving</font>

1399
01:01:27,599 --> 01:01:51,869
forward yes sir right no no no sir no

1400
01:01:48,539 --> 01:01:54,509
sir and that's that's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is one of</font>

1401
01:01:51,869 --> 01:01:56,880
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> most wonderful problems I think we</font>

1402
01:01:54,509 --> 01:01:58,949
<font color="#E5E5E5">have I think as an industry we really</font>

1403
01:01:56,880 --> 01:02:03,389
have one big problem and that is

1404
01:01:58,949 --> 01:02:06,209
quantifying the effectiveness efficacy

1405
01:02:03,389 --> 01:02:08,369
<font color="#CCCCCC">of people use different words but of a</font>

1406
01:02:06,209 --> 01:02:09,569
control right because<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's no</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> longer one</font>

1407
01:02:08,369 --> 01:02:11,519
hundred percent you have a complex

1408
01:02:09,569 --> 01:02:14,399
system of controls which is why I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

1409
01:02:11,519 --> 01:02:17,428
PCI is a model of a complex system of

1410
01:02:14,399 --> 01:02:19,859
controls<font color="#E5E5E5"> because you have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mass</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> no lines</font>

1411
01:02:17,429 --> 01:02:22,829
in in this year's data breach report out

1412
01:02:19,859 --> 01:02:25,259
of people who are<font color="#CCCCCC"> PC i had</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> PCI concerns</font>

1413
01:02:22,829 --> 01:02:28,109
ninety percent<font color="#E5E5E5"> of them were compliant</font>

1414
01:02:25,259 --> 01:02:30,449
with in to end encryption encryption of

1415
01:02:28,109 --> 01:02:31,979
data and trap and transit which is you

1416
01:02:30,449 --> 01:02:33,329
know you hear this<font color="#E5E5E5"> Indian encryption is</font>

1417
01:02:31,979 --> 01:02:35,129
going to solve<font color="#E5E5E5"> it all no it's another</font>

1418
01:02:33,329 --> 01:02:38,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">imaginal line it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just like port 80</font>

1419
01:02:35,130 --> 01:02:43,469
just like your AV they will adapt it's a

1420
01:02:38,939 --> 01:02:45,899
complex adaptive system anyway back to

1421
01:02:43,469 --> 01:02:47,519
what you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> saying that's why I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

1422
01:02:45,899 --> 01:02:50,308
interested in like Jean Kim's were

1423
01:02:47,519 --> 01:02:51,839
visible ops for security I'm talking

1424
01:02:50,309 --> 01:02:53,549
about effectiveness it's got to be

1425
01:02:51,839 --> 01:02:56,788
evidence-based it's got to be studied

1426
01:02:53,549 --> 01:02:58,649
that's one of what my risk team and my

1427
01:02:56,789 --> 01:03:00,749
intelligence team is what we're working

1428
01:02:58,649 --> 01:03:02,759
on as<font color="#CCCCCC"> well and trying to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> figure that out</font>

1429
01:03:00,749 --> 01:03:05,279
the other thing that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting is is</font>

1430
01:03:02,759 --> 01:03:09,089
you think about the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ability to prevent</font>

intelligent attacker for something you

1434
01:03:12,659 --> 01:03:16,499
have to actually worry about there is<font color="#E5E5E5"> no</font>

1435
01:03:13,949 --> 01:03:18,539
first level present prevent and you have

1436
01:03:16,499 --> 01:03:20,189
prevent detect and respond in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the first</font>

1437
01:03:18,539 --> 01:03:21,809
level detect and respond only gets you

1438
01:03:20,189 --> 01:03:25,259
to a second level prevent if

1439
01:03:21,809 --> 01:03:29,339
good enough right and if<font color="#E5E5E5"> it modeling can</font>

1440
01:03:25,259 --> 01:03:33,630
can can show you that but a the point

1441
01:03:29,339 --> 01:03:34,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">being detect and respond are we can get</font>

1442
01:03:33,630 --> 01:03:36,930
success metrics that's why i love

<font color="#E5E5E5">penetration testing now after hating it</font>

1444
01:03:36,930 --> 01:03:40,529
for so long<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's why i believe in red</font>

1445
01:03:38,880 --> 01:03:44,849
team testing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's why i want to</font>

1446
01:03:40,529 --> 01:03:47,069
understand if we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can put models together</font>

1447
01:03:44,849 --> 01:03:49,140
in a business warehouse and track

effectiveness of spawned processes

1449
01:03:49,140 --> 01:03:53,759
automated spawn processes and so forth

1450
01:03:51,180 --> 01:03:57,180
excuse me<font color="#CCCCCC"> i get passionate</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's cool</font>

1451
01:03:53,759 --> 01:03:59,249
it's cool set it<font color="#E5E5E5"> down so it can it can</font>

1452
01:03:57,180 --> 01:04:01,948
be done it probably will be<font color="#E5E5E5"> done I mean</font>

1453
01:03:59,249 --> 01:04:03,660
this is I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and you know the various</font>

1454
01:04:01,949 --> 01:04:06,539
frameworks come<font color="#E5E5E5"> a long way Alex but it's</font>

1455
01:04:03,660 --> 01:04:08,189
still in early stages very rivers we're

1456
01:04:06,539 --> 01:04:10,109
still in a problem of if you're trying

1457
01:04:08,189 --> 01:04:12,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do pattern detection you have to at</font>

1458
01:04:10,109 --> 01:04:13,799
least in retrospect after some amount<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

1459
01:04:12,150 --> 01:04:18,119
time know if you made<font color="#E5E5E5"> a right versus</font>

1460
01:04:13,799 --> 01:04:21,930
wrong decision right so in after some

1461
01:04:18,119 --> 01:04:24,119
time more sophistication data sorry more

1462
01:04:21,930 --> 01:04:28,109
data I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I think that it will</font>

1463
01:04:24,119 --> 01:04:31,229
become clearer what the success stories

1464
01:04:28,109 --> 01:04:34,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">are so in in transaction modeling in</font>

1465
01:04:31,229 --> 01:04:37,109
fraud for example we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to know in at</font>

1466
01:04:34,650 --> 01:04:38,880
the end<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the day whether we made right</font>

1467
01:04:37,109 --> 01:04:41,189
or wrong decisions because it costs us

1468
01:04:38,880 --> 01:04:43,769
money either way so since we're trying

1469
01:04:41,189 --> 01:04:46,199
to optimize this decisions based on you

1470
01:04:43,769 --> 01:04:48,178
know a<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple of factors but at those</font>

1471
01:04:46,199 --> 01:04:52,019
factors become money for us<font color="#E5E5E5"> very quickly</font>

1472
01:04:48,179 --> 01:04:54,839
we want to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> very precise right if we</font>

1473
01:04:52,019 --> 01:04:57,629
were highly highly risk averse and there

1474
01:04:54,839 --> 01:05:00,390
was no cost to say declining good

1475
01:04:57,630 --> 01:05:02,219
transactions to us then we would we

1476
01:05:00,390 --> 01:05:04,890
would optimize our models in order<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1477
01:05:02,219 --> 01:05:07,049
minimize loss as low as possible right

1478
01:05:04,890 --> 01:05:10,469
but obviously<font color="#CCCCCC"> when you cut off a good</font>

1479
01:05:07,049 --> 01:05:14,519
transaction that costs you a lot as well

1480
01:05:10,469 --> 01:05:16,049
so finding that balance point then it

1481
01:05:14,519 --> 01:05:18,689
becomes the challenge but right now I

1482
01:05:16,049 --> 01:05:21,089
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're still in in kind of not out</font>

1483
01:05:18,689 --> 01:05:22,439
of the woods yet as far as what are the

1484
01:05:21,089 --> 01:05:24,538
what are the patterns that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're trying</font>

1485
01:05:22,439 --> 01:05:27,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">to isolate and so as we get better at</font>

1486
01:05:24,539 --> 01:05:28,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">that then we'll get better at you know</font>

1487
01:05:27,299 --> 01:05:30,749
there's the patterns we're trying to

1488
01:05:28,920 --> 01:05:33,660
isolate and they're differentiated from

1489
01:05:30,749 --> 01:05:34,618
the rest of operations which if they're

1490
01:05:33,660 --> 01:05:35,710
not the product we're trying to isolate

1491
01:05:34,619 --> 01:05:39,190
is probably

1492
01:05:35,710 --> 01:05:41,170
good stuff that makes sense great which

1493
01:05:39,190 --> 01:05:43,420
is why I was stoked about the one go of

1494
01:05:41,170 --> 01:05:44,950
the data warehouse yeah that's pretty

1495
01:05:43,420 --> 01:05:47,500
cool<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm preventing zoos how many</font>

1496
01:05:44,950 --> 01:05:50,680
terabytes of data lot who do clusters

1497
01:05:47,500 --> 01:05:52,390
yep yep<font color="#E5E5E5"> but that's why</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm hearing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

1498
01:05:50,680 --> 01:05:54,819
<font color="#CCCCCC">that because you know Zeus Zeus</font>

1499

infections that are ACH transfers

1500
01:05:54,820 --> 01:05:58,000
that'll ruin a business you know that'll

1501
01:05:56,320 --> 01:06:01,630
in dental in careers that'll ruin lives

1502
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:04,660

1503
01:06:01,630 --> 01:06:06,520
pattern matching he's got he understands

1504
01:06:04,660 --> 01:06:11,220
you know what's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on and he's got a</font>

1505
01:06:06,520 --> 01:06:11,220
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> good success rate so anyway yes sir</font>

1506
01:06:29,300 --> 01:06:33,860
sure and I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got I've got actually a</font>

1507
01:06:31,550 --> 01:06:38,570
several years<font color="#E5E5E5"> of experience and training</font>

1508
01:06:33,860 --> 01:06:40,580
that I will tell you that for financial

1509
01:06:38,570 --> 01:06:44,690
institutions Security department's I've

1510
01:06:40,580 --> 01:06:47,509
seen it be very easy depending on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1511
01:06:44,690 --> 01:06:48,740
bureaucracy involved and and how big the

1512
01:06:47,510 --> 01:06:50,660
security department is and if

1513
01:06:48,740 --> 01:06:52,339
everybody's playing ball and the siso

1514
01:06:50,660 --> 01:06:56,029
really says this is how life is going to

1515
01:06:52,340 --> 01:06:57,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">be where else it can be really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> easy it</font>

1516
01:06:56,030 --> 01:06:59,870
you know we've done two day trainings

1517
01:06:57,920 --> 01:07:02,030
for sophisticated risk models and had

1518
01:06:59,870 --> 01:07:03,500
success we've done you know kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a</font>

1519
01:07:02,030 --> 01:07:06,080
couple morning trainings on the varus

1520
01:07:03,500 --> 01:07:07,250
framework we're developing software for

1521
01:07:06,080 --> 01:07:10,430
training that's going to make it even

1522
01:07:07,250 --> 01:07:12,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">easier for folks so it can be done</font>

1523
01:07:10,430 --> 01:07:14,750
fairly easily just depends<font color="#E5E5E5"> on kind of</font>

1524
01:07:12,890 --> 01:07:15,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">the width of the security department and</font>

1525
01:07:14,750 --> 01:07:18,130
the breadth<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the training that you're</font>

1526
01:07:15,890 --> 01:07:18,129
<font color="#CCCCCC">giving</font>

1527
01:07:31,240 --> 01:07:35,680
yeah yeah I do and I don't have any

1528
01:07:33,520 --> 01:07:37,630
answers for you other than the fact that

1529
01:07:35,680 --> 01:07:38,680
if there are already people who are I

1530
01:07:37,630 --> 01:07:42,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">know that there are people were</font>

1531
01:07:38,680 --> 01:07:43,690
committed to<font color="#E5E5E5"> sharing data and one of the</font>

1532
01:07:42,100 --> 01:07:46,330
things that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I hope</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do is to be able</font>

1533
01:07:43,690 --> 01:07:49,600
to evangelize I use the word sorry

1534
01:07:46,330 --> 01:07:51,790
everybody but I hope<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be able to show</font>

1535
01:07:49,600 --> 01:07:53,529
people will look this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

1536
01:07:51,790 --> 01:07:55,330
informative I'm glad you spent all this

1537
01:07:53,530 --> 01:07:57,460
money but look how much better it gets

1538
01:07:55,330 --> 01:08:00,190
with comparative analytics right and

1539
01:07:57,460 --> 01:08:01,900
guess what yeah there's a data set that

1540
01:08:00,190 --> 01:08:03,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">you can get for free verizon is always</font>

1541
01:08:01,900 --> 01:08:06,220
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to give you something free but if</font>

1542
01:08:03,190 --> 01:08:08,920
you want real-time operational stuff

1543
01:08:06,220 --> 01:08:11,259
right you're going to have to share back

1544
01:08:08,920 --> 01:08:15,040
and that's just the way it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

1545
01:08:11,260 --> 01:08:17,200
it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be a meritocracy and</font>

1546
01:08:15,040 --> 01:08:19,839
that's how<font color="#CCCCCC"> I hope to approach it will at</font>

1547
01:08:17,200 --> 01:08:22,479
work I have no idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm optimistic and</font>

1548
01:08:19,839 --> 01:08:24,670
so far you know senior management at

1549
01:08:22,479 --> 01:08:34,540
verizon is you know full steam ahead

1550
01:08:24,670 --> 01:08:41,890
oracle try something else that's true is

1551
01:08:34,540 --> 01:08:45,310
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it can once twice I'm just kidding</font>

1552

I'm hat Alex Hutton on<font color="#CCCCCC"> Twitter and if</font>

1559
01:08:58,720 --> 01:09:04,720
usefulness of my answer because pretty

01:09:02,920 --> 01:09:06,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">spent at this point and I have a</font>
