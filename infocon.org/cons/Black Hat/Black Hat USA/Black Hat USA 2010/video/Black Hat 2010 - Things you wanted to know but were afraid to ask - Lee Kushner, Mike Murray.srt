but the one thing that we do on a

31
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:31,170
regular basis on the blog is we do

32
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:36,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> called career advice Tuesday</font>

and we'll post it up the site basically

38
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:52,439
anonymously oh it's bad already but you

39
00:01:51,329 --> 00:01:55,589
know we posted on the site anonymously

40
00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:58,020
and really you know what we try to do is

41
00:01:55,590 --> 00:02:00,119
to take personal questions<font color="#E5E5E5"> and give them</font>

42
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:01,890
a little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a broader appeal so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

43
00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:04,740
everybody can benefit from the advice

49
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:19,200
interesting to the person sitting next

50
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:21,268
to you so when we<font color="#CCCCCC"> talked to Jeff and</font>

here and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know give the audience and</font>

55
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:31,349
<font color="#E5E5E5">the attendees a chance to ask whatever</font>

questions that they want about<font color="#E5E5E5"> their</font>

57
00:02:31,349 --> 00:02:38,220
careers and we thought it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was a good</font>

58
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:40,799
idea and look anything that so that the

59
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:43,590
basis of the session here is really<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

60

know it's your session now I to ask<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

61
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:47,129
you know the one ground rule is that you

62
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:49,980
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> whatever happens here kind of stays</font>

63
00:02:47,129 --> 00:02:52,440
here I didn't I didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that up but</font>

64
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:54,510
um<font color="#CCCCCC"> but just the idea is that you know</font>

65
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:56,310
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> are going to ask some questions</font>

66
00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:59,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">that are personal to them just to make</font>

67
00:02:56,310 --> 00:03:03,269
sure that you know nobody judges anybody

68
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:05,549
and you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> as much as you want to talk</font>

69
00:03:03,269 --> 00:03:08,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">about you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the specifics of your</font>

70
00:03:05,549 --> 00:03:10,530
personal<font color="#CCCCCC"> view of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your questions we'd be</font>

71
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:13,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">happy to go into as much detail as</font>

72
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:15,420
possible if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we run out of questions Mike</font>

73
00:03:13,890 --> 00:03:17,458
and I have some<font color="#CCCCCC"> questions that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we've</font>

74
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:20,760
built<font color="#E5E5E5"> on our own that might help that</font>

75
00:03:17,459 --> 00:03:23,849
<font color="#CCCCCC">are common questions that we get but in</font>

76
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:27,959
general<font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean I guess the best way to</font>

77
00:03:23,849 --> 00:03:29,459
say is this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is that I guess to start to</font>

78
00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:34,980
give you guys maybe a little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a</font>

79
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:37,829
backdrop we did this talk we did this

80
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:40,138
compensation survey this<font color="#E5E5E5"> past oh</font>

81
00:03:37,829 --> 00:03:43,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">goodness what it was the spring of this</font>

82
00:03:40,139 --> 00:03:45,389
year right and the survey itself we I

83
00:03:43,799 --> 00:03:46,440
mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it was just kind of interesting</font>

84
00:03:45,389 --> 00:03:48,450
point because people have some very

85
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:51,030
interesting gears of ideas about

86
00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:52,980
compensation and it was just a 15

87
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:55,650
question survey that we put together and

88
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:58,379
it was really talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about people's</font>

89
00:03:55,650 --> 00:03:59,639
attitudes towards compensation I just

90
00:03:58,379 --> 00:04:01,950
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to give</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you guys</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a little bit of</font>

91
00:03:59,639 --> 00:04:04,950
data from that I think you<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys might</font>

92
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:06,510
find interesting so and a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of these</font>

93
00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:10,828
questions really kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of come out about</font>

94
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:13,530
perception on the perception of which

95
00:04:10,829 --> 00:04:15,299
are you in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Provence Liza I mean and</font>

96
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:17,039
<font color="#CCCCCC">really talking about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the individual</font>

97
00:04:15,299 --> 00:04:19,228
nature of the careers about what really

98
00:04:17,039 --> 00:04:22,289
<font color="#E5E5E5">matters</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to the individual themselves and</font>

99
00:04:19,228 --> 00:04:25,590
so we asked the question say instead of

100
00:04:22,289 --> 00:04:28,400
money if you had to accept less

101
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:30,530
compensation for your job

102
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:33,979
what would you be willing to<font color="#CCCCCC"> trade and</font>

103
00:04:30,530 --> 00:04:36,919
you know we found some interesting stuff

104
00:04:33,979 --> 00:04:40,039
we found<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the number one answer that</font>

105
00:04:36,919 --> 00:04:42,349
we received was forty-nine percent

106
00:04:40,039 --> 00:04:44,300
people said and you could you could pick

107
00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:46,520
as many question answers as you wanted

108
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:49,280
but forty-nine percent of the

109
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:51,620
respondents basically said I take more

110
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:54,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">money to less money</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to save my own ass I</font>

111
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:57,440
thought<font color="#CCCCCC"> that number would be higher but</font>

112
00:04:54,919 --> 00:04:58,729
I thought<font color="#CCCCCC"> that was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> fair I think that</font>

113
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:00,380
that kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of showed a lot of confidence</font>

114
00:04:58,729 --> 00:05:02,870
that people felt that they could get

115
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:04,310
another<font color="#E5E5E5"> job that if they were told that</font>

116
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:06,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">they had to take less money that they</font>

117
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:08,630
would sooner go out and get other

118
00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:10,550
employment but I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think the thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

119
00:05:08,630 --> 00:05:14,210
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> the most fascinating</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thing to both</font>

120
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:16,490
of us was that forty-seven percent

121
00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:18,859
almost the same amount of people said

122
00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:21,770
that they would take less money in their

123
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:26,210
job if they got more education and more

124
00:05:21,770 --> 00:05:30,530
training so the concept is this is that

125
00:05:26,210 --> 00:05:34,460
say getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> more training is basically</font>

126
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:36,169
equivalent to saving your own ass it's

127
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:38,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of interesting that it's so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> close</font>

128
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:40,010
but it shows how<font color="#E5E5E5"> important that training</font>

129
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:43,430
education and professional development

130
00:05:40,010 --> 00:05:45,800
is to information security professionals

131
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:49,099
as a whole and then the other stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

132
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:50,630
was interesting is that about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same</font>

133
00:05:49,099 --> 00:05:52,969
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know between 35 and thirty-eight</font>

134
00:05:50,630 --> 00:05:56,810
percent of the folks said that things

135
00:05:52,970 --> 00:05:59,930
like work less hours more vacation time

136
00:05:56,810 --> 00:06:01,729
the ability<font color="#CCCCCC"> to telecommute that all</font>

137
00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:05,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">those three main quality of life issues</font>

138
00:06:01,729 --> 00:06:08,599
became very important you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know we're</font>

139
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:10,729
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> important that was kind of</font>

140
00:06:08,599 --> 00:06:12,800
interesting<font color="#CCCCCC"> stuff we also got another</font>

141
00:06:10,729 --> 00:06:14,659
<font color="#E5E5E5">piece of information that was you know</font>

142
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:17,270
we started to talk to people<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

143
00:06:14,659 --> 00:06:20,150
information security professionals

144
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:21,740
attitudes towards compensation and I

145
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:24,409
<font color="#CCCCCC">think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that the one thing that we kind of</font>

146
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:26,960
found was there were some real big

147
00:06:24,409 --> 00:06:31,580
perception issues yeah no no question I

148
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:34,190
mean we we tend<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be very we believe</font>

149
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:37,729
<font color="#CCCCCC">that as security people we are more</font>

150
00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:39,529
valuable than our peers and<font color="#E5E5E5"> IT that we</font>

151
00:06:37,729 --> 00:06:42,110
because we're security people we deserve

152
00:06:39,529 --> 00:06:44,719
more than the other IT people

153
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:46,400
I mean so listen<font color="#CCCCCC"> so so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> let's just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> do a</font>

154
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:48,140
random sampling because there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

155
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:51,229
be some audience participation anyway so

156
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:53,479
just ask a couple of questions right so

157
00:06:51,230 --> 00:06:56,090
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're an information security</font>

158
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:59,000
professional how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you believe</font>

159
00:06:56,090 --> 00:07:01,549
that you should earn more money than

160
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:04,700
somebody with the same skills but

161
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:05,930
another IT professional but who doesn't

162
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:10,700
have security as part of their

163
00:07:05,930 --> 00:07:15,200
discipline how many people<font color="#CCCCCC"> believe that</font>

164
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:17,090
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> shown a lot more money right so in</font>

165
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:18,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">our survey right fifty percent half the</font>

166
00:07:17,090 --> 00:07:20,929
audience responded said that they

167
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:24,200
believe that they should earn a<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit more</font>

168
00:07:20,930 --> 00:07:26,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">than I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> T and thirty-three percent said</font>

169
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:30,140
that they should earn a lot more<font color="#CCCCCC"> because</font>

170
00:07:26,690 --> 00:07:31,880
their security so total of eight what

171
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:34,250
was at eighty-three percent is like five

172
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:37,430
as like basically five out of six which

173
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:38,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">is pretty</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting right and so</font>

174
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:40,190
here's another question we asked how

175
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:45,349
<font color="#CCCCCC">many people feel that they're underpaid</font>

176
00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:46,700
in their job about half the room how

177
00:07:45,350 --> 00:07:51,950
many people<font color="#CCCCCC"> feel that they're overpaid</font>

178
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:53,599
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> zero me so I mean in the survey</font>

179
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:56,180
right sixty percent of the respondents

180
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:57,500
felt that they were underpaid and only

181
00:07:56,180 --> 00:08:01,220
three percent of the folks thought they

182
00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:02,870
were overpaid and so last year here's

183
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:08,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">another one how many</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people got a salary</font>

184
00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:13,970
increase last year only like about half

185
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:16,130
got a salary increase anything but so

186
00:08:13,970 --> 00:08:18,770
let me of everybody who had a salary

187
00:08:16,130 --> 00:08:21,409
<font color="#CCCCCC">increase how many</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people were</font>

188
00:08:18,770 --> 00:08:25,640
disappointed in the amount<font color="#E5E5E5"> of their</font>

189
00:08:21,410 --> 00:08:27,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">salary increase about half of that how</font>

190
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:31,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">many people were pleasantly surprised</font>

191
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:33,559
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> so the ratio is basically</font>

192
00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:36,409
somewhere between five and six to one of

193
00:08:33,559 --> 00:08:37,669
disappointed to surprise in our survey

194
00:08:36,409 --> 00:08:41,000
fifty percent of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the folks were</font>

195
00:08:37,669 --> 00:08:45,410
disappointed and only ten percent were

196
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:47,810
pleasantly surprised so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the</font>

197
00:08:45,410 --> 00:08:50,150
one<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing that we can see here when you</font>

198
00:08:47,810 --> 00:08:53,349
look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at this data is that there's some</font>

199
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:58,510
really big strong messaging<font color="#E5E5E5"> diskette</font>

200
00:08:53,350 --> 00:09:03,190
between<font color="#CCCCCC"> peoples individuals perception</font>

201
00:08:58,510 --> 00:09:05,980
and the marketplace perception and I

202
00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:09,070
think that<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's one of the big reasons</font>

203
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:12,010
are the big divides when it comes down

204
00:09:09,070 --> 00:09:13,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">to job satisfaction when it comes down</font>

205
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:16,180
to people feeling good about the work

206
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:17,860
that they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing and getting really</font>

207
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:21,069
maximum value out of their<font color="#E5E5E5"> information</font>

208
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:24,100
security career was so don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> take</font>

209
00:09:21,070 --> 00:09:25,600
questions<font color="#CCCCCC"> no yeah I mean so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you want to</font>

210
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:28,360
go through you want to go through that a

211
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:30,160
little bit my cuz no<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was gonna wait</font>

212
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:31,870
let's let's do some let's do some live

213
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:36,040
questions if anybody's got one anybody

214
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:37,930
got a question yeah hold<font color="#E5E5E5"> on before you</font>

215
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:39,219
ask it i'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> gonna</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do the van</font>

216
00:09:37,930 --> 00:09:41,020
a white thing and run<font color="#CCCCCC"> around and</font>

217
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:46,720
actually make sure that you end up on

218
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:48,760
Mike<font color="#E5E5E5"> the people at home yeah so you</font>

219
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:52,660
started out at the start by comparing

220
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:57,460
salaries of infosec professionals to IT

221
00:09:52,660 --> 00:10:00,280
professionals and I voted that info SEC

222
00:09:57,460 --> 00:10:06,070
professionals should be paid<font color="#E5E5E5"> more and my</font>

223
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:12,400
perception just is that there's many

224
00:10:06,070 --> 00:10:15,850
more people in IT and much more of just

225
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:17,350
many more people a few inserted there

226
00:10:15,850 --> 00:10:20,170
fewer information security for your

227
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:24,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">information security sure so wouldn't</font>

228
00:10:20,170 --> 00:10:26,740
that justify higher pay in in infosec if

229
00:10:24,850 --> 00:10:28,690
there's a higher demand well if you're

230
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:30,490
an information security professional it

231
00:10:28,690 --> 00:10:32,680
justifies that to you but in corporate

232
00:10:30,490 --> 00:10:36,130
HR functions they don't differentiate

233
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:38,890
yeah so I'm I think it's a

234
00:10:36,130 --> 00:10:41,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">specialization you would you say by</font>

235
00:10:38,890 --> 00:10:43,960
saying<font color="#E5E5E5"> aye everybody in IT is</font>

236
00:10:41,290 --> 00:10:46,060
specialized your DBA your security

237
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:47,650
person it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> any different but we</font>

238
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:50,079
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> our specialization is somehow more</font>

239
00:10:47,650 --> 00:10:52,660
valuable than the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other ones right it's</font>

240
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:55,240
not it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> that there are there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

241
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:58,810
probably not that many more<font color="#CCCCCC"> DBAs in the</font>

242
00:10:55,240 --> 00:11:00,130
world or<font color="#CCCCCC"> son you know son unix</font>

243
00:10:58,810 --> 00:11:02,500
administrators in the world and there

244
00:11:00,130 --> 00:11:03,939
are security people everybody's got

245
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:06,910
their own specialization so the idea

246
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:08,740
that our specialization is somehow more

247
00:11:06,910 --> 00:11:10,120
well then all<font color="#E5E5E5"> the other ones that and</font>

248
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:13,030
that's where what Lee was just saying

249
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:14,980
the corporate I the corporate HR

250
00:11:13,030 --> 00:11:16,870
function goes well this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is just one more</font>

251
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:19,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">checkbox on my list the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> quote</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

252
00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:21,370
company doesn't really care so when we

253
00:11:19,390 --> 00:11:22,900
work with a large company if we work

254
00:11:21,370 --> 00:11:26,200
with a large financial services

255
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:28,900
institution or a large retail company

256
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:31,600
when they're hiring for security they

257
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:35,140
basically have<font color="#E5E5E5"> did anybody have salary</font>

258
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:37,330
bands in their jobs or salary numbers

259
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:40,449
that come so those numbers<font color="#E5E5E5"> are not</font>

260
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:43,090
security specific numbers those numbers

261
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:45,730
from an HR perspective cut across the

262
00:11:43,090 --> 00:11:48,670
entire company so when they're figuring

263
00:11:45,730 --> 00:11:51,310
out what to pay you they're looking

264
00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:55,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">there's something that they refer</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to is</font>

265
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:57,459
called internal equity and what they're

266
00:11:55,090 --> 00:12:00,280
trying to do is<font color="#CCCCCC"> to create more of a</font>

267
00:11:57,460 --> 00:12:04,450
standardized blueprint across the

268
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:07,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">company to manage costs and to make sure</font>

269
00:12:04,450 --> 00:12:10,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">that there becomes a degree of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> normalcy</font>

270
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:14,260
throughout the organization and security

271
00:12:10,450 --> 00:12:16,810
in the 90s maybe the early 2000s we're

272
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:21,010
able to get more of a<font color="#CCCCCC"> skillset premium</font>

273
00:12:16,810 --> 00:12:23,949
but now as security has become you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

274
00:12:21,010 --> 00:12:27,340
we've accomplished our goal we've become

275
00:12:23,950 --> 00:12:29,020
more<font color="#E5E5E5"> mainstream we're more accepted by</font>

276
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:31,480
corporations corporations have a

277
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:34,449
security function and because we've been

278
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:36,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">so good at making ourselves a standard</font>

279
00:12:34,450 --> 00:12:39,160
or a component of corporate

280
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:42,430
infrastructure we have to play by the

281
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:53,350
same rules so thinking that we<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't is</font>

282
00:12:42,430 --> 00:12:57,729
a big fallacy sir oh this isn't really a

283
00:12:53,350 --> 00:13:03,520
money thing but uh so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I guess if you are</font>

284
00:12:57,730 --> 00:13:04,960
oh sorry about<font color="#CCCCCC"> that if you're a security</font>

285
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:07,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">professional in a corporate environment</font>

286
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:10,300
not a government environment whether it

287
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:11,680
be network security what have you in

288
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:14,709
your head you're thinking to yourself

289
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:18,609
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay my job is to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> protect this company</font>

290
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:20,440
so in that light I deserve more than the

291
00:13:18,610 --> 00:13:20,800
guy who is selling the product<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this</font>

292
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:23,740
company

293
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:26,170
because what I do actually has a bigger

294
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:29,019
stake if what I do if I slack off or if

295
00:13:26,170 --> 00:13:31,329
I don't do my job correctly bad things

296
00:13:29,019 --> 00:13:32,890
could<font color="#CCCCCC"> really happen whereas if that guy</font>

297
00:13:31,330 --> 00:13:34,870
doesn't do his job maybe he doesn't sell

298
00:13:32,890 --> 00:13:37,569
as much well if there's no sales then

299
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:39,940
you all don't have jobs that's true so I

300
00:13:37,570 --> 00:13:41,589
mean everybody is the thing is this is

301
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:44,649
<font color="#CCCCCC">that we have we all have our own vanity</font>

302
00:13:41,589 --> 00:13:47,589
we all<font color="#E5E5E5"> believe that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we're more important</font>

303
00:13:44,649 --> 00:13:50,440
than we truly are I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that everybody</font>

304
00:13:47,589 --> 00:13:53,050
who comes<font color="#CCCCCC"> to work has a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> certain sense of</font>

305
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:55,450
professional pride so they believe

306
00:13:53,050 --> 00:13:57,699
there's a sense of importance that if I

307
00:13:55,450 --> 00:14:00,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't do my job then this is the</font>

308
00:13:57,700 --> 00:14:05,079
consequence but those consequences can

309
00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:07,120
be applied to every position so I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

310
00:14:05,079 --> 00:14:09,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">that you know one of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the bigger trends</font>

311
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:10,810
in corporate America would be instead of

312
00:14:09,430 --> 00:14:12,310
and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably a different way to</font>

313
00:14:10,810 --> 00:14:14,500
think but when we start hiring

314
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:16,930
executives Security leaders chief

315
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:20,290
security officers they stop thinking

316
00:14:16,930 --> 00:14:23,079
about how the chief security person can

317
00:14:20,290 --> 00:14:25,810
save the company money or protect them

318
00:14:23,079 --> 00:14:28,359
security professionals have to begin to

319
00:14:25,810 --> 00:14:31,479
<font color="#E5E5E5">think about how is security going to</font>

320
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:33,700
enable the business to make money so

321
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:36,160
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is definitely a bigger shift</font>

322
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:38,410
that's happening right<font color="#CCCCCC"> now is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that when</font>

323
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:41,620
we look for chief security officers and

324
00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:43,899
I sit with CFOs and CEOs of companies

325
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:46,000
and saying we need to fix our security

326
00:14:43,899 --> 00:14:49,060
problem we<font color="#CCCCCC"> need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to make this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

327
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:52,450
world-class security function instead<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

328
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:55,239
<font color="#E5E5E5">asking for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a security</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> professional who</font>

329
00:14:52,450 --> 00:14:57,730
understands<font color="#E5E5E5"> business they ask us for a</font>

330
00:14:55,240 --> 00:15:01,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">business leader who understands security</font>

331
00:14:57,730 --> 00:15:04,870
so it becomes<font color="#CCCCCC"> theirs becoming a shift in</font>

332
00:15:01,690 --> 00:15:07,690
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> market</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that should really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> start</font>

333
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:12,399
permeating how we think of our careers

334
00:15:07,690 --> 00:15:15,070
ultimately you know that shift towards

335
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:18,160
towards moving out of the cost<font color="#E5E5E5"> Center</font>

336
00:15:15,070 --> 00:15:19,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">role and moving towards being a business</font>

337
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:21,189
driver is something we really haven't

338
00:15:19,930 --> 00:15:22,779
talked<font color="#CCCCCC"> about as an industry we're all</font>

339
00:15:21,190 --> 00:15:24,579
still our head space<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean even this</font>

340
00:15:22,779 --> 00:15:27,880
whole conference our head<font color="#E5E5E5"> space is in</font>

341
00:15:24,579 --> 00:15:31,239
technology and<font color="#E5E5E5"> how we do all the cool</font>

342
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:33,279
stuff far too few of us are thinking all

343
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:34,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">right how does what I do make the</font>

344
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:40,450
company money

345
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:42,700
just not seeing it oh sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> it does but</font>

346
00:15:40,450 --> 00:15:46,329
well it isn't it isn't let me give you

347
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:48,490
an example<font color="#E5E5E5"> I worked for for a large</font>

348
00:15:46,329 --> 00:15:51,849
insurance company<font color="#CCCCCC"> for a while</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and one of</font>

349
00:15:48,490 --> 00:15:53,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">the things that we tried to push for</font>

350
00:15:51,850 --> 00:15:57,459
security was that security allowed us to

351
00:15:53,950 --> 00:16:00,130
negotiate better contracts with certain

352
00:15:57,459 --> 00:16:02,859
vendors we were able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to because we could</font>

353
00:16:00,130 --> 00:16:05,380
position ourselves as as having less

354
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:07,839
risk we<font color="#E5E5E5"> were a less risky business</font>

355
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:09,820
partner at this point we're driving the

356
00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:11,620
company's revenue generation right we're

357
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:13,450
actually we're putting ourselves in a

358
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:15,579
position where that risk management

359
00:16:13,450 --> 00:16:18,010
function allows the company to be more

360
00:16:15,579 --> 00:16:19,660
competitive<font color="#E5E5E5"> within the field of offering</font>

361
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:22,360
different you know incentives in the

362
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:24,010
contract I'll ask the kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of thought</font>

363
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:26,350
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the kind of thinking that we need</font>

364
00:16:24,010 --> 00:16:29,019
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> start to go towards so I a lot of</font>

365
00:16:26,350 --> 00:16:32,560
times at the executive level in security

366
00:16:29,019 --> 00:16:35,529
security gets baked into key customer

367
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:37,599
pursuits because the vet just<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the</font>

368
00:16:35,529 --> 00:16:43,240
very reasons that<font color="#E5E5E5"> mica-lined right there</font>

369
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:46,390
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ability for a secure partner</font>

370
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:49,480
to be seen as a business advantage over

371
00:16:46,390 --> 00:16:54,189
against against other weaker partners

372
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:56,829
sometimes it's more about having better

373
00:16:54,190 --> 00:16:58,540
than your competitors but being able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

374
00:16:56,829 --> 00:17:00,459
articulate that message in a

375
00:16:58,540 --> 00:17:04,510
multi-hundred million dollar type

376
00:17:00,459 --> 00:17:06,129
contract win that becomes humongous so I

377
00:17:04,510 --> 00:17:08,890
mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's just one example but</font>

378
00:17:06,130 --> 00:17:12,760
security is getting more<font color="#CCCCCC"> and more baked</font>

379
00:17:08,890 --> 00:17:14,500
into the acquisition process<font color="#CCCCCC"> as opposed</font>

380
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:16,119
to the defense process it's the same

381
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:18,849
thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that businesses went through in</font>

382
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:21,668
the 80s with quality you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know up until</font>

383
00:17:18,849 --> 00:17:23,290
up until the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the Japanese revolution in</font>

384
00:17:21,669 --> 00:17:25,240
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> eighth he's a quality was really</font>

385
00:17:23,290 --> 00:17:26,889
looked at as something that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you didn't</font>

386
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:28,150
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to spend on because you</font>

387
00:17:26,890 --> 00:17:30,220
could spend a<font color="#CCCCCC"> whole lot of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> money and get</font>

388
00:17:28,150 --> 00:17:33,010
quality but then you'd lower your profit

389
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:34,990
margins and then they figured<font color="#E5E5E5"> out the</font>

390
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:37,150
slogan from the Deming people was

391
00:17:34,990 --> 00:17:39,669
quality is free that if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> put in</font>

392
00:17:37,150 --> 00:17:41,320
enough quality more<font color="#E5E5E5"> people will buy your</font>

393
00:17:39,669 --> 00:17:43,390
product more people<font color="#CCCCCC"> will be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> interested</font>

394
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:45,730
in you and you will end up making more

395
00:17:43,390 --> 00:17:46,929
money by putting that investment in and

396
00:17:45,730 --> 00:17:48,310
you're right<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's risk management</font>

397
00:17:46,929 --> 00:17:50,020
quality is risk man

398
00:17:48,310 --> 00:17:52,570
insecurities risk management ultimately

399
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:54,610
all it is is managing your company

400
00:17:52,570 --> 00:17:58,060
effectively managing your company well

401
00:17:54,610 --> 00:18:00,280
and that's a business advantage that's a

402
00:17:58,060 --> 00:18:01,600
business driver and if you can are if

403
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:03,610
you can teach the organization to

404
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:06,790
articulate that to their customers and

405
00:18:03,610 --> 00:18:08,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">in the sales cycle you become part</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

questions hold on thank you in my world

413
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:35,590
what I see is the headcount for

414
00:18:32,110 --> 00:18:36,909
pure-play<font color="#CCCCCC"> infosec people dropping and I</font>

415
00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:38,290
was wondering that that's in my small

416
00:18:36,910 --> 00:18:40,570
world and you're a broad view of the

417
00:18:38,290 --> 00:18:43,060
industry what are you seeing especially

418
00:18:40,570 --> 00:18:45,909
looking after the five to 10-year time

419
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:47,560
on are you<font color="#E5E5E5"> seeing more in for playing</font>

420
00:18:45,910 --> 00:18:49,780
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> such jobs get rolled back into IT</font>

421
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:54,940
making security part of everyone's job

422
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:56,590
I'll tell put my spin on this I've said

423
00:18:54,940 --> 00:19:00,190
for a while that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> infosec is</font>

424
00:18:56,590 --> 00:19:02,740
going away as a pure discipline there

425
00:19:00,190 --> 00:19:05,260
are two real functions in our world

426
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:08,620
today there is the risk management

427
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:10,210
function and the thinking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about limiting</font>

428
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:13,179
business risk limiting risk of loss

429
00:19:10,210 --> 00:19:14,710
compliance you know governance things

430
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:17,080
like that and then there's the

431
00:19:14,710 --> 00:19:19,900
operations function well we've already

432
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:21,909
started to<font color="#E5E5E5"> see the model of this things</font>

433
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:25,960
that used to be traditional<font color="#CCCCCC"> infosec</font>

434
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:27,730
things like firewall management well how

435
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:29,110
many how many of you<font color="#CCCCCC"> guys your firewall</font>

436
00:19:27,730 --> 00:19:30,250
management group doesn't report to<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

437
00:19:29,110 --> 00:19:35,350
C so it reports to your network

438
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:36,400
operations guy right a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> almost most</font>

439
00:19:35,350 --> 00:19:39,010
of the big companies<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I work with</font>

440
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:41,980
they're rolling firewall management into

441
00:19:39,010 --> 00:19:44,110
network engineering they're rolling you

442
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:46,780
know what used to be vulnerability

443
00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:49,840
management into server ops just as the

444
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:52,540
patch cycle and so these operational

445
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:54,340
things move towards that the risk

446
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:57,399
management things move towards the

447
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:59,560
governance group legal compliance

448
00:19:57,400 --> 00:20:01,270
financial risk management if you're at a

449
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:02,200
financial<font color="#E5E5E5"> services firm they're already</font>

450
00:20:01,270 --> 00:20:03,490
doing a lot of that there

451
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:05,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">we have a lot of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people thinking about</font>

452
00:20:03,490 --> 00:20:07,150
similar problems in different areas so I

453
00:20:05,890 --> 00:20:10,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">think you're gonna</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> see a lot of the</font>

454
00:20:07,150 --> 00:20:13,210
infosec thinkers move more into more

455
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:16,360
into that<font color="#E5E5E5"> group you you see there being</font>

456
00:20:13,210 --> 00:20:19,180
less role for that<font color="#CCCCCC"> pure-play infosec</font>

457
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:21,399
person and you end up being yourself the

458
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:23,080
question do I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be an IT infosec</font>

459
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:25,720
person what do I want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be a risk</font>

460
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:28,000
management info<font color="#E5E5E5"> SEC person and over the</font>

461
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:30,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">next 10 20 30 years i think we probably</font>

462
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,810
find that that the pure play I mean

463
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:33,520
there's always going to be a role<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

464
00:20:31,810 --> 00:20:36,520
the pure play information<font color="#E5E5E5"> security</font>

465
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:40,120
person but it's not going to be I

466
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:42,700
remember like five six years<font color="#E5E5E5"> ago people</font>

467
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:45,580
used to talk about how<font color="#E5E5E5"> infosec would be</font>

468
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:47,350
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> biggest group with nit I think</font>

469
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:51,159
that's I think that's a ludicrous idea

470
00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:52,780
so I'll give you I have a client and a

471
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:57,220
friend of mine somebody know for about

472
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:59,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">12</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 15 years he's the sea so of a call</font>

473
00:20:57,220 --> 00:21:01,480
to fortune 50 large financial so one of

474
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:06,340
the largest companies in the world and

475
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:09,700
his<font color="#E5E5E5"> last role was to be the senior VP of</font>

476
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:11,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">security operations and he said to me</font>

477
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:12,790
called me up one day said you know I

478
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:14,949
<font color="#E5E5E5">haven't a very interesting job he said</font>

479
00:21:12,790 --> 00:21:17,230
the more<font color="#E5E5E5"> I figured the more efficient</font>

480
00:21:14,950 --> 00:21:19,750
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I am and my</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> job will be you know</font>

481
00:21:17,230 --> 00:21:21,940
will<font color="#E5E5E5"> be when I actually worked myself</font>

482
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:25,180
out of a job and his job<font color="#CCCCCC"> was to</font>

483
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:30,550
eliminate all the IT security operations

484
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:35,590
functions or to outsource them to Indian

485
00:21:30,550 --> 00:21:36,760
Asia and so do i<font color="#E5E5E5"> think that there and so</font>

486
00:21:35,590 --> 00:21:38,709
it's kind of interesting right you know

487
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:41,710
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> government is that the big articles</font>

488
00:21:38,710 --> 00:21:43,990
before the show with about 20,000 people

489
00:21:41,710 --> 00:21:46,510
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> need the government needs</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they've</font>

490
00:21:43,990 --> 00:21:50,020
assessed<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we need 20,000 information</font>

491
00:21:46,510 --> 00:21:54,550
security professionals so who's right

492
00:21:50,020 --> 00:22:00,129
and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> answer is this is that</font>

493
00:21:54,550 --> 00:22:03,220
security will continue to be a

494
00:22:00,130 --> 00:22:06,250
discipline but it will be rolled into it

495
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:10,600
become a component of other positions

496
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:12,640
and you know I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that you</font>

497
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:14,620
might not have dedicated more dedicated

00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:15,309
security headcount your security

499
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:18,549
headcount might be

500
00:22:15,309 --> 00:22:22,690
come more strategic as opposed to<font color="#E5E5E5"> last</font>

501
00:22:18,549 --> 00:22:24,309
as opposed to more tactical so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font>

502
00:22:22,690 --> 00:22:27,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">that that's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> something that we have to</font>

503
00:22:24,309 --> 00:22:29,918
think about<font color="#E5E5E5"> with our careers</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you know I</font>

504
00:22:27,009 --> 00:22:33,429
mean you have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> think about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that in a</font>

505
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:37,419
broader horizon what's the shelf life<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

506
00:22:33,429 --> 00:22:39,820
my technical skills what's the law of

00:22:37,419 --> 00:22:42,460
diminishing returns how much<font color="#E5E5E5"> would</font>

508
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:46,178
somebody really be willing to pay me if

509
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:49,240
I'm the best insert technical skills

510
00:22:46,179 --> 00:22:53,200
technical security seal here person and

511
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:55,419
we I<font color="#CCCCCC"> mean that's the the firewall</font>

engineer model is a is a good one to

513
00:22:55,419 --> 00:23:00,789
look at if you go back to nineteen

514
00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:02,799
ninety-seven firewall engineers were hot

515
00:23:00,789 --> 00:23:04,658
if you could<font color="#E5E5E5"> do firewall engineering you</font>

516
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:08,139
were you know you were very employable

517
00:23:04,659 --> 00:23:10,149
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> weren't very employee you were I</font>

00:23:08,139 --> 00:23:12,248
mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> you could write</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your own ticket in</font>

00:23:12,249 --> 00:23:15,730
somebody put people with five been

00:23:13,779 --> 00:23:17,470
recruiting since 1996 in this space

522
00:23:15,730 --> 00:23:19,749
right but we were<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to find people</font>

that checkpoint firewall skills in<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

524
00:23:19,749 --> 00:23:27,789
time 130 140 150 and up and because it

525
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:30,129
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> supply demand right and now it's a</font>

526
00:23:27,789 --> 00:23:32,110
it's a component of the network

527

engineering job and it's sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you</font>

528
00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:36,008
know entry level skill it's expected

529
00:23:34,029 --> 00:23:37,869
right you'd be expected to know how to

530
00:23:36,009 --> 00:23:40,450
administer a firewall how much<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">that same model 13 years from now let</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me</font>

533
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:46,479
<font color="#CCCCCC">think about pen testing right think</font>

534
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:51,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">about the shift in pen testing from</font>

software security you're starting<font color="#CCCCCC"> to see</font>

537
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:58,509
look web apps are still<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty hot but</font>

538
00:23:56,799 --> 00:24:01,600
they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> fizzling a little bit you know</font>

539
00:23:58,509 --> 00:24:06,429
web app security web app pen testing was

540
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:07,959
a lot hotter three years ago<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you</font>

541
00:24:06,429 --> 00:24:09,340
start thinking about where it is now and

542
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:12,129
now you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> seeing a little bit more</font>

that are kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of moving so i think that</font>

ground and I really thought<font color="#CCCCCC"> that that</font>

575
00:25:42,759 --> 00:25:48,129
was a poignant idea<font color="#CCCCCC"> I I don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

576
00:25:45,909 --> 00:25:52,029
we've I don't think<font color="#CCCCCC"> we've really shifted</font>

577
00:25:48,129 --> 00:25:53,649
that much in terms of<font color="#E5E5E5"> our role in cloud</font>

578
00:25:52,029 --> 00:25:56,169
security because cloud security is

579
00:25:53,649 --> 00:25:58,119
ultimately just a question of you the

580
00:25:56,169 --> 00:25:59,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">data is in a different place the data</font>

581
00:25:58,119 --> 00:26:02,649
has different exposure how's that any

582
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:04,989
different than what we've had to do as

583
00:26:02,649 --> 00:26:07,238
Pete as data got more mobile you know

584
00:26:04,989 --> 00:26:09,970
you we have to deal with USB keys and

585
00:26:07,239 --> 00:26:12,519
USB drives and data<font color="#E5E5E5"> moving more easily</font>

586
00:26:09,970 --> 00:26:14,230
it's just a new storage location for

587
00:26:12,519 --> 00:26:17,799
data I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't think that there's</font>

588
00:26:14,230 --> 00:26:19,659
a radical redesign in the entire the

589
00:26:17,799 --> 00:26:22,629
principles<font color="#E5E5E5"> of risk threat vulnerability</font>

590
00:26:19,659 --> 00:26:24,129
and and value still there's they're the

591
00:26:22,629 --> 00:26:26,759
same it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just a slightly different</font>

592
00:26:24,129 --> 00:26:26,759
calculation

593
00:26:57,630 --> 00:27:01,920
it's always prudent if I so it depends

594
00:27:00,510 --> 00:27:03,810
on what you're at what you're asking

595
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:05,190
from a career perspective it's always

596
00:27:03,810 --> 00:27:07,590
prudent to be studying<font color="#E5E5E5"> what the next</font>

597
00:27:05,190 --> 00:27:09,540
thing is I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think you kind of have to</font>

598
00:27:07,590 --> 00:27:11,459
especially in our<font color="#E5E5E5"> industry</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I rant about</font>

599
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:13,440
our industry a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot because I think our</font>

600
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:16,020
industry is probably one of the hardest

601
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:20,400
industries in in the entire world to

602
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:22,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">make a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> career Ian because the security</font>

603
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:26,550
issue is always in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> new technology</font>

604
00:27:22,770 --> 00:27:28,230
it's never in you never very rarely see

605
00:27:26,550 --> 00:27:30,090
something that's oh this is a

606
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:31,680
vulnerability in a<font color="#E5E5E5"> 13 year old piece of</font>

607
00:27:30,090 --> 00:27:35,189
technology that no one's ever found

608
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:36,960
before it's always<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the new stuff so</font>

609
00:27:35,190 --> 00:27:38,940
unlike accounting where the rules have

610
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:41,250
basically been the same other than a few

wouldn't even<font color="#E5E5E5"> be worth talking to so is</font>

616
00:27:52,830 --> 00:27:57,270
that might be a little bit everybody's

617
00:27:54,570 --> 00:27:58,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">we're talking to well you know as far as</font>

perspective you would be so far behind

621
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:07,230
the game that you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not even relevant</font>

622
00:28:03,870 --> 00:28:09,929
whereas in lots of other fields that's

623
00:28:07,230 --> 00:28:12,240
not five years<font color="#E5E5E5"> is nothing but in ours</font>

624
00:28:09,930 --> 00:28:15,360
five years is huge so the idea of<font color="#CCCCCC"> being</font>

625
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:17,910
ahead of it absolutely you're and you're

626
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:19,110
you're bang-on cloud and moving to

627
00:28:17,910 --> 00:28:21,180
converge environments and the whole

628
00:28:19,110 --> 00:28:22,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">thing is going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to change our skill set a</font>

629
00:28:21,180 --> 00:28:23,850
lot we're gonna have to learn a whole

630
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:25,679
lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> new stuff that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we've never</font>

631
00:28:23,850 --> 00:28:26,909
learned before does<font color="#CCCCCC"> it change</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> our role</font>

632
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:29,400
completely<font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't think so i think</font>

633
00:28:26,910 --> 00:28:32,130
we're still the same people<font color="#CCCCCC"> we but but</font>

634
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:34,170
it's the same question<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you I bet if i</font>

635
00:28:32,130 --> 00:28:36,750
was if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we had time machine and I could</font>

636
00:28:34,170 --> 00:28:38,370
have done<font color="#E5E5E5"> this talk in 2003 you would</font>

637
00:28:36,750 --> 00:28:41,490
have asked me the same question about

638
00:28:38,370 --> 00:28:44,909
wireless networks and they in a

639
00:28:41,490 --> 00:28:46,050
different form yeah but it's the same it

640
00:28:44,910 --> 00:28:47,880
would have<font color="#E5E5E5"> been the same kind of</font>

641
00:28:46,050 --> 00:28:49,290
question now everything's going to be

642
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:51,690
Wireless how does that change our world

643
00:28:49,290 --> 00:28:52,980
it didn't we had to learn a whole bunch

644
00:28:51,690 --> 00:28:55,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">of new stuff we had to deal with a whole</font>

645
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:59,100
bunch of you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> Oh crack oh crap WEP</font>

646
00:28:55,890 --> 00:29:00,990
is cracked let's we got now our wireless

647
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:02,699
is all messed up we're gonna have to

648
00:29:00,990 --> 00:29:04,920
learn<font color="#CCCCCC"> that stuff there's lessons there</font>

649
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:06,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is the same kind of lessons we've</font>

650
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:08,490
learned with other new technologies

651
00:29:06,060 --> 00:29:10,560
along the way so<font color="#E5E5E5"> the so the key here is</font>

652
00:29:08,490 --> 00:29:11,200
this right<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean so like to take you</font>

653
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:14,799
into

654
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:17,950
the value<font color="#CCCCCC"> cycle within an organization</font>

655
00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:20,320
or as companies look for skill and look

656
00:29:17,950 --> 00:29:23,740
for talent right so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I could put that</font>

657
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:26,529
spit on it is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that when companies go out</font>

658
00:29:23,740 --> 00:29:31,450
and they're hiring right when something

659
00:29:26,529 --> 00:29:33,039
new is a new technology a new technology

660
00:29:31,450 --> 00:29:36,220
a new business function whatever it

661
00:29:33,039 --> 00:29:38,649
might be initially what they do is they

662
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:43,720
need to start seeking out people who can

663
00:29:38,649 --> 00:29:46,779
<font color="#CCCCCC">help them solve their problem</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and the</font>

664
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:49,539
more current your skills relate to the

665
00:29:46,779 --> 00:29:55,809
future problems that a company will have

666
00:29:49,539 --> 00:29:58,000
the more leverage or the more in demand

667
00:29:55,809 --> 00:30:01,840
it's a supplied emits a simple supply

668
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:05,769
demand scenario so the idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> being</font>

669
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:08,408
able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> position yourself in a way where</font>

670
00:30:05,769 --> 00:30:10,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">you can become more valuable and that</font>

671
00:30:08,409 --> 00:30:14,110
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> leverage the skill set that you</font>

672
00:30:10,450 --> 00:30:15,940
currently have to look forward I think

673
00:30:14,110 --> 00:30:18,039
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's a big thing right looking forward</font>

674
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:20,260
I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think a lot of people get enamored</font>

675
00:30:18,039 --> 00:30:22,210
with their press clippings and they talk

676
00:30:20,260 --> 00:30:24,039
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> how many articles they wrote and</font>

677
00:30:22,210 --> 00:30:26,110
how many conferences that they spoke at

678
00:30:24,039 --> 00:30:29,679
and all this other stuff at the end of

679
00:30:26,110 --> 00:30:32,439
the day it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> really about your skill and</font>

680
00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:35,049
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really about your ability to solve</font>

681
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:37,899
somebody's problem and if<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

682
00:30:35,049 --> 00:30:40,658
<font color="#CCCCCC">case the employer will get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> something</font>

683
00:30:37,899 --> 00:30:44,799
that they need and you can leverage<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

684
00:30:40,659 --> 00:30:46,419
skill to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> something that you want you</font>

685
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:48,399
think about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you think about all</font>

686
00:30:46,419 --> 00:30:52,149
when you're selecting a position<font color="#CCCCCC"> right</font>

687
00:30:48,399 --> 00:30:53,799
what do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you guys think about when you</font>

688
00:30:52,149 --> 00:30:57,120
select that way if you're changing jobs

689
00:30:53,799 --> 00:30:57,120
one of the things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think about</font>

690
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:03,520
you

691
00:31:08,269 --> 00:31:12,619
but when you're making a decision if I

692
00:31:10,940 --> 00:31:14,029
was going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to leave my employer to go to</font>

693
00:31:12,619 --> 00:31:16,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">another employer that's what you're</font>

694
00:31:14,029 --> 00:31:24,919
thinking you're thinking what's the the

695
00:31:16,940 --> 00:31:26,389
vendor doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> where was ok so you're</font>

696
00:31:24,919 --> 00:31:28,519
<font color="#E5E5E5">trying</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to think like what can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out</font>

00:31:26,389 --> 00:31:32,649
<font color="#CCCCCC">of it that I don't already have ok</font>

698
00:31:28,519 --> 00:31:32,649
that's good anybody else back

699
00:31:45,389 --> 00:31:56,070
so you're looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> for commitment that's</font>

700
00:31:48,149 --> 00:32:03,359
commitment anybody else before travel

what's in<font color="#E5E5E5"> it for me type of scenario</font>

self-preservation is our greatest drive

707
00:32:23,820 --> 00:32:32,790
so the best part about these answers is

708
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:36,479
that all these answers are unique to the

709

individual and they're all right and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

710
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:40,230
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the one thing that you can</font>

711
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:43,260
pull from these things is that you have

<font color="#CCCCCC">to determine your list of things that</font>

00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:53,400
is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to sound completely crazy</font>

716
00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:56,970
coming from somebody who makes their

717
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:59,430
living off people changing positions the

718
00:32:56,970 --> 00:33:02,940
best advice<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I give most people is</font>

719
00:32:59,430 --> 00:33:07,260
to remain in their<font color="#E5E5E5"> job and to make their</font>

720
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:09,600
job work for them it's crazy right I

721
00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:12,960
mean that was<font color="#CCCCCC"> just crazy right but the</font>

722
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:18,270
idea is this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you build internal</font>

723
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:21,330
brand in your<font color="#CCCCCC"> job people know you they</font>

724
00:33:18,270 --> 00:33:23,879
count<font color="#E5E5E5"> on you they already know what they</font>

725
00:33:21,330 --> 00:33:28,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">can go to you for you built</font>

726
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:31,230
relationships those types of things have

727
00:33:28,260 --> 00:33:33,720
a tremendous<font color="#E5E5E5"> amount of value so in a lot</font>

728
00:33:31,230 --> 00:33:38,730
of cases what happens is people give up

729
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:41,430
too early what you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be able to do</font>

730
00:33:38,730 --> 00:33:45,360
is figure out<font color="#E5E5E5"> how to social engineer</font>

731
00:33:41,430 --> 00:33:49,140
your position<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get the skills out of</font>

732
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:50,820
it that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you want and after you try and</font>

733
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:53,520
try and if you can't do that at that

734
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:57,330
point in time you should look elsewhere

735
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:59,700
but when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you look elsewhere make sure</font>

736
00:33:57,330 --> 00:34:04,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">that when you look elsewhere you're</font>

to<font color="#CCCCCC"> get something</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for that risk and</font>

739

sometimes<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can change jobs for money</font>

741
00:34:12,989 --> 00:34:18,929
sometimes you can change jobs for

00:34:16,110 --> 00:34:23,640
quality of<font color="#E5E5E5"> life or commute or to learn a</font>

new skill or for a different program but

744
00:34:23,639 --> 00:34:27,629
you have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that before you</font>

745
00:34:25,469 --> 00:34:30,449
go out<font color="#CCCCCC"> and change you should have a game</font>

746
00:34:27,630 --> 00:34:32,460
plan for doing so the last<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing you</font>

747
00:34:30,449 --> 00:34:34,199
want to do is<font color="#CCCCCC"> change jobs and what all</font>

you got was a new golf shirt

749
00:34:34,199 --> 00:34:39,239
you got the same job but just a

00:34:36,119 --> 00:34:48,899
different color golf shirt me think

751

about that sir don't hurt yourself Mike

00:34:48,899 --> 00:34:55,918
<font color="#CCCCCC">all right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cool does your advice</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

753

people vary by their age and<font color="#E5E5E5"> what I'm</font>

it's illegal United States you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know it's</font>

756
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:03,869
it's much harder<font color="#E5E5E5"> to hold down that info</font>

00:35:05,099 --> 00:35:10,589
corporate environments to 50 and 60 and

760
00:35:07,650 --> 00:35:11,520
beyond what I'm getting at there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

761
00:35:10,589 --> 00:35:13,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">guess the second part of my question</font>

762
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:15,270
have you feel about advising on

763
00:35:13,710 --> 00:35:16,890
moonlighting you have to go build your

764
00:35:15,270 --> 00:35:19,710
own job later in case you get displaced

765
00:35:16,890 --> 00:35:23,848
permanently as you go to 50 55<font color="#CCCCCC"> 16 beyond</font>

766
00:35:19,710 --> 00:35:25,500
well so let<font color="#E5E5E5"> me address that right so</font>

767
00:35:23,849 --> 00:35:26,609
obviously just from<font color="#CCCCCC"> your two questions</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

768
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:28,980
could tell that that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> something that's</font>

769
00:35:26,609 --> 00:35:32,759
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> creeping right so let's just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> say</font>

770
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:37,140
a couple things it's good I mean look<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

771
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:39,030
ignore that ageism racism gender<font color="#E5E5E5"> ISM</font>

772
00:35:37,140 --> 00:35:41,220
whatever you want to call it low to

773
00:35:39,030 --> 00:35:44,280
ignore that that's something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

774
00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:47,700
doesn't exist behind all the EoE

775
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:49,589
statements that are out there<font color="#E5E5E5"> you after</font>

776
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:52,710
15 years of doing that you can't

777
00:35:49,589 --> 00:35:54,359
convince me that it doesn't right and

778
00:35:52,710 --> 00:35:56,190
I've worked<font color="#E5E5E5"> with very small companies</font>

779
00:35:54,359 --> 00:35:58,650
I've worked with very big companies I

780
00:35:56,190 --> 00:36:01,589
work with very structured HR functions

781
00:35:58,650 --> 00:36:05,760
and very non existent HR functions right

782
00:36:01,589 --> 00:36:09,810
I think when it<font color="#CCCCCC"> comes down to this is</font>

783
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:13,530
that when you look at any skill you look

784
00:36:09,810 --> 00:36:15,810
at value and I think that<font color="#CCCCCC"> instead of</font>

785
00:36:13,530 --> 00:36:18,329
moonlighting to go out and trying to

786
00:36:15,810 --> 00:36:21,420
head your bed a little bit I think you'd

787
00:36:18,329 --> 00:36:25,410
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> better off making yourself so</font>

788
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:27,480
valuable to your organization that they

789
00:36:25,410 --> 00:36:29,640
can't afford<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get in other words</font>

790
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:32,400
they're better than any<font color="#E5E5E5"> other existing</font>

791
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:34,259
option and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can say to somebody so</font>

792
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:37,500
look I'm a at this point in my career

793
00:36:34,260 --> 00:36:40,260
I'm not interested in promotions I'm you

794
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:43,650
can have many people don't communicate

795
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:45,599
openly with their employers a lot of

796
00:36:43,650 --> 00:36:47,920
managers believe that their employees

797
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:53,830
want the same exact things out of<font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font>

798
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:55,930
careers as they want for theirs so if

799
00:36:53,830 --> 00:36:58,210
you're in a<font color="#CCCCCC"> situation where you're</font>

800
00:36:55,930 --> 00:37:01,149
saying hey look I really like my job and

801
00:36:58,210 --> 00:37:04,030
I would just get so down good at it that

802
00:37:01,150 --> 00:37:08,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">when they say who's the best person on</font>

803
00:37:04,030 --> 00:37:10,630
the team you're the guy so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

804
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:12,910
if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you could</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> take</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that effort that you</font>

805
00:37:10,630 --> 00:37:16,540
might divert other<font color="#E5E5E5"> weres whether way and</font>

806
00:37:12,910 --> 00:37:19,240
push it<font color="#CCCCCC"> down into your job and into your</font>

807
00:37:16,540 --> 00:37:21,820
own development if you do<font color="#E5E5E5"> that and your</font>

808
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:23,649
<font color="#CCCCCC">company doesn't like you you're going to</font>

809
00:37:21,820 --> 00:37:26,770
be valuable outside the other employers

810
00:37:23,650 --> 00:37:28,870
to you could go do 1099 contracting

811
00:37:26,770 --> 00:37:31,030
because in those situations they don't

812
00:37:28,870 --> 00:37:34,029
care about career development they just

813
00:37:31,030 --> 00:37:35,980
care about skill<font color="#E5E5E5"> I actually I got a good</font>

814
00:37:34,030 --> 00:37:39,610
example of that I worked<font color="#E5E5E5"> with a guy at</font>

815
00:37:35,980 --> 00:37:43,180
one point who was one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> three experts</font>

816
00:37:39,610 --> 00:37:46,600
in the world on a particular part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

817
00:37:43,180 --> 00:37:48,850
mainframe security I mean uber uber

818
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:51,549
specialized but I mean this guy was the

819
00:37:48,850 --> 00:37:55,330
best of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> best you can write your own</font>

820
00:37:51,550 --> 00:37:58,900
ticket on that one thing so the question

821
00:37:55,330 --> 00:38:01,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">is you know what do you want to be known</font>

822
00:37:58,900 --> 00:38:02,650
for we<font color="#CCCCCC"> talked a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lot about branding we</font>

823
00:38:01,180 --> 00:38:04,509
talked a lot about the importance of

824
00:38:02,650 --> 00:38:09,640
being known for something being known as

825
00:38:04,510 --> 00:38:12,700
something specifically and we talked a

826
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:14,710
lot about that because ultimately what

827
00:38:12,700 --> 00:38:16,450
you're known for will if you if you can

828
00:38:14,710 --> 00:38:21,640
establish a brand whatever that brand is

829
00:38:16,450 --> 00:38:23,890
best guy on the team for<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing X if X is</font>

830
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:26,920
a valuable thing you will<font color="#E5E5E5"> always have a</font>

831
00:38:23,890 --> 00:38:28,839
position I mean you know and whether if

832
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:30,400
the position is not their position will

833
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:39,640
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> somebody somewhere else you're going</font>

834
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:41,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> say something here you're saying that</font>

835
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:44,470
you should make yourself valuable to

836
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:46,480
your company right so are you<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking</font>

837
00:38:44,470 --> 00:38:49,750
more at the managerial director vp

838
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:51,760
because your<font color="#CCCCCC"> vp may think ok my team the</font>

to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go out and build and make some more</font>

857
00:39:35,820 --> 00:39:43,440
investments in yourself yes you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can get</font>

858
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:45,960
red lines but if you get redlined you

859
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:49,800
should go ah if something bad comes down

860
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:52,650
what are my options and I think that

861
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:55,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's our own kind of career contingency</font>

862
00:39:52,650 --> 00:40:00,270
plan right so it's about planning you

863
00:39:55,410 --> 00:40:01,589
have to think<font color="#CCCCCC"> advance so yes we can all</font>

864
00:40:00,270 --> 00:40:04,230
you know I mean think about all those

865
00:40:01,590 --> 00:40:07,710
god I I mean it's a perfect example I

866
00:40:04,230 --> 00:40:10,860
mean this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is like real life right so in</font>

867
00:40:07,710 --> 00:40:14,070
New York<font color="#E5E5E5"> City the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> two places that you</font>

868
00:40:10,860 --> 00:40:15,510
really could never ever pull people out

869
00:40:14,070 --> 00:40:17,400
of work Goldman Sachs and Lehman

870
00:40:15,510 --> 00:40:19,500
Brothers and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> only places that those</font>

871
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:23,250
guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> would go would be to each other</font>

872
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:26,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">because their teams were so great Lehman</font>

873
00:40:23,250 --> 00:40:29,070
Brothers doesn't exist anymore a lot of

874
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:30,420
those<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys didn't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know what to do they</font>

875
00:40:29,070 --> 00:40:31,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">wound up going to a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> different</font>

876
00:40:30,420 --> 00:40:34,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">like I know a lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of guys that are</font>

877
00:40:31,830 --> 00:40:36,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">excellent brothers guys now that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are in</font>

878
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:38,250
Philadelphia that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are in Washington DC</font>

879
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:41,549
that are in all these other places

880
00:40:38,250 --> 00:40:43,320
because they got so caught up<font color="#CCCCCC"> with the</font>

881
00:40:41,550 --> 00:40:46,500
fact that things were going so good

882
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:49,950
internally that they didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think about</font>

883
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:52,710
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> would happen if if I had to look</font>

884
00:40:49,950 --> 00:40:55,049
for a job<font color="#CCCCCC"> where would</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i look where what</font>

885
00:40:52,710 --> 00:40:57,390
my skills be valid<font color="#E5E5E5"> and who could pay me</font>

886
00:40:55,050 --> 00:41:00,870
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to be a what I need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to earn</font>

887
00:40:57,390 --> 00:41:04,259
you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to think that way because</font>

888
00:41:00,870 --> 00:41:06,240
unfortunately the only career that we

889
00:41:04,260 --> 00:41:09,060
only thing that we control is our skills

890
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:10,839
we did this talk earlier today I don't

891
00:41:09,060 --> 00:41:13,240
know if anybody was here or not but

892
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:14,830
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> top was focused the title of the</font>

893
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:19,390
talk was your career is your<font color="#CCCCCC"> business</font>

894
00:41:14,830 --> 00:41:22,060
and the concept is is that you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

895
00:41:19,390 --> 00:41:26,080
manage<font color="#E5E5E5"> your career as it is a business</font>

896
00:41:22,060 --> 00:41:28,060
you that's the one thing that you own is

897
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:32,529
your skill development it's your money

898
00:41:28,060 --> 00:41:35,799
maker you control that you don't control

899
00:41:32,530 --> 00:41:37,810
the ecosystem of the company you<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font>

900
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:40,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">control the ethics of the company you</font>

901
00:41:37,810 --> 00:41:41,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">don't control the financial viability of</font>

00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:44,170
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> commanding your company to get</font>

00:41:41,890 --> 00:41:46,569
bought it could get acquired it could go

904
00:41:44,170 --> 00:41:49,600
under bit cost-cutting I mean if you

905
00:41:46,570 --> 00:41:50,980
work<font color="#CCCCCC"> for BP they lost I mean a lot of</font>

906
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:54,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">people going to lose their jobs over</font>

907
00:41:50,980 --> 00:41:56,080
there when<font color="#CCCCCC"> that happens something like</font>

908
00:41:54,460 --> 00:41:58,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">that happens</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you have to keep your head</font>

909
00:41:56,080 --> 00:42:01,540
up and looking for things to say what is

910
00:41:58,870 --> 00:42:03,370
the long-term viability of my company

911
00:42:01,540 --> 00:42:06,220
what's the sustainability of my company

912
00:42:03,370 --> 00:42:09,160
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> what becomes my contingency plan in</font>

913
00:42:06,220 --> 00:42:11,020
in reference to that talk earlier we in

914
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:14,980
if you think about your career as a

915
00:42:11,020 --> 00:42:16,900
business you are<font color="#E5E5E5"> the product you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are the</font>

916
00:42:14,980 --> 00:42:19,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">product you sell to your to your current</font>

917
00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:21,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">employer who is your customer think</font>

918
00:42:19,990 --> 00:42:23,919
about it<font color="#E5E5E5"> from a product management</font>

919
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:25,270
perspective if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you were going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to build</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

920
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:28,030
product would you build a product that

921
00:42:25,270 --> 00:42:30,880
was only valuable to one employer to one

922
00:42:28,030 --> 00:42:32,860
customer maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> if the customer was big</font>

923
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:34,390
enough and you trusted them but probably

924
00:42:32,860 --> 00:42:36,610
not this is where you're moonlighting

925
00:42:34,390 --> 00:42:38,830
question comes along do i do<font color="#E5E5E5"> I go out</font>

926
00:42:36,610 --> 00:42:40,360
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> have five different businesses so</font>

927
00:42:38,830 --> 00:42:42,670
that I have five different things so

928
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:45,340
that if one of them goes away I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

929
00:42:42,670 --> 00:42:48,250
no probably not because<font color="#E5E5E5"> then you're</font>

930
00:42:45,340 --> 00:42:50,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">diffusing your mouth your ability to</font>

931
00:42:48,250 --> 00:42:53,440
really focus and specialized and become

932
00:42:50,380 --> 00:42:55,300
known as one thing though there's

933
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:57,640
there's an expression<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I liked is</font>

934
00:42:55,300 --> 00:43:02,020
Yoda you could only run ride one horse

935
00:42:57,640 --> 00:43:03,670
with one ass yeah and and really so but

936
00:43:02,020 --> 00:43:05,140
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> the question</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and what Lee's saying</font>

937
00:43:03,670 --> 00:43:08,140
is if you think about<font color="#E5E5E5"> yourself from a</font>

938
00:43:05,140 --> 00:43:09,940
product management perspective how can

939
00:43:08,140 --> 00:43:12,819
you build the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next version of yourself</font>

940
00:43:09,940 --> 00:43:14,320
such that there are a whole lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

941
00:43:12,820 --> 00:43:16,540
potential customers<font color="#CCCCCC"> who are looking for</font>

942
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:19,150
you or at least you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know who the</font>

943
00:43:16,540 --> 00:43:21,910
potential customers are you know that

944
00:43:19,150 --> 00:43:24,430
I'm really great I'm a really great

945
00:43:21,910 --> 00:43:27,009
security architect for

946
00:43:24,430 --> 00:43:28,690
our health<font color="#E5E5E5"> care so I would be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> fantastic</font>

947
00:43:27,010 --> 00:43:32,290
in these types of<font color="#CCCCCC"> health care</font>

948
00:43:28,690 --> 00:43:34,510
organizations well so if your particular

949
00:43:32,290 --> 00:43:36,850
organization your current client

950
00:43:34,510 --> 00:43:39,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">redlines</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the whole department and you</font>

951
00:43:36,850 --> 00:43:41,259
your job disappears you have a list<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

952
00:43:39,310 --> 00:43:42,940
potential prospects<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you're going to</font>

953
00:43:41,260 --> 00:43:44,530
call on I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> like if you were in</font>

954
00:43:42,940 --> 00:43:46,960
health care right now right I mean if

955
00:43:44,530 --> 00:43:48,790
that was your thinking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about electronic</font>

956
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:50,650
you know electronic medical records

957
00:43:48,790 --> 00:43:52,810
security I'd be thinking about

958
00:43:50,650 --> 00:43:56,050
frameworks like high trust and high-tech

959
00:43:52,810 --> 00:43:57,790
I would make sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> staying on</font>

960
00:43:56,050 --> 00:44:00,400
some of the leading edge of those<font color="#E5E5E5"> types</font>

961
00:43:57,790 --> 00:44:02,410
of developments because at some point in

962
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:04,720
time my career<font color="#CCCCCC"> is going to intersect</font>

963
00:44:02,410 --> 00:44:07,240
with the market and I think that you

964
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:09,490
know a lot of security people say oh

965
00:44:07,240 --> 00:44:11,680
yeah I'm a business person 2 and they

966
00:44:09,490 --> 00:44:15,009
throw that around like oh yeah I'm a

967
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:17,529
business person but being a business

968
00:44:15,010 --> 00:44:20,680
person really means understanding the

969
00:44:17,530 --> 00:44:25,570
core business of your company at a macro

970
00:44:20,680 --> 00:44:28,299
level thinking about how the company is

971
00:44:25,570 --> 00:44:30,910
positioning themselves for the future

972
00:44:28,300 --> 00:44:33,940
what business initiatives are going to

973
00:44:30,910 --> 00:44:38,049
be on their plate and how does security

974
00:44:33,940 --> 00:44:40,840
play an integral role in making those

975
00:44:38,050 --> 00:44:44,200
businesses profitable and successful and

976
00:44:40,840 --> 00:44:46,960
you have to think that way it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> more of</font>

977
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:48,700
a mindset because the one constant in

978
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:50,560
all of<font color="#E5E5E5"> our careers no matter if you're</font>

979
00:44:48,700 --> 00:44:54,910
just starting out or you're getting

980
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:58,450
towards retirement is time you think

981
00:44:54,910 --> 00:45:00,009
about that right i mean throughout your

982
00:44:58,450 --> 00:45:04,000
career going to make a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of different</font>

983
00:45:00,010 --> 00:45:05,260
decisions and time remains that constant

984
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:08,110
it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to you know you're going to</font>

985
00:45:05,260 --> 00:45:11,110
work 25 35 I mean people might work 35

986
00:45:08,110 --> 00:45:12,970
40 years now you start thinking about

987
00:45:11,110 --> 00:45:16,990
that all the<font color="#E5E5E5"> decisions that you make</font>

988
00:45:12,970 --> 00:45:21,069
have upside and reward and have

989
00:45:16,990 --> 00:45:23,109
consequences so thinking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about how</font>

990
00:45:21,070 --> 00:45:26,800
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> making those decisions and</font>

991
00:45:23,110 --> 00:45:29,380
planning<font color="#CCCCCC"> for that is a key component on</font>

992
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:31,360
how you manage your career yeah the

993
00:45:29,380 --> 00:45:34,930
amount of<font color="#E5E5E5"> time available for you to do</font>

994
00:45:31,360 --> 00:45:38,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">things is finite you I actually i read a</font>

995
00:45:34,930 --> 00:45:40,540
statistic one at one point that mo

996
00:45:38,260 --> 00:45:44,500
people unless you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> an insanely</font>

997
00:45:40,540 --> 00:45:48,790
dedicated reader you will read less than

998
00:45:44,500 --> 00:45:52,600

1080
00:49:31,360 --> 00:49:35,560
thing that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can think about your</font>

1081
00:49:32,740 --> 00:49:41,589
certifications is your certifications

1082
00:49:35,560 --> 00:49:47,470
signal theory they don't get you

1083
00:49:41,590 --> 00:49:49,570

1086
00:49:53,080 --> 00:49:58,420
certification I think they're all great

1087
00:49:55,030 --> 00:49:59,800
it shows to me in my line of work that

1088
00:49:58,420 --> 00:50:03,160
somebody's committed

1089
00:49:59,800 --> 00:50:05,350
to their profession do I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think that</font>

1090

there<font color="#CCCCCC"> does that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> them great do I say</font>

1091
00:50:05,350 --> 00:50:12,069
wow they're persons<font color="#E5E5E5"> a cissp no because</font>

1092
00:50:07,750 --> 00:50:15,520
everybody's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a cissp and if you're not I</font>

1093
00:50:12,070 --> 00:50:19,030
don't care because my clients don't care

1094
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:21,550
a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people a lot of people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> rail on</font>

1095
00:50:19,030 --> 00:50:25,690
certifications you know I the jokes

1096
00:50:21,550 --> 00:50:27,670
about MC SES abound but a certification

1097
00:50:25,690 --> 00:50:29,620
Lee mentioned signal theory I don't know

1098
00:50:27,670 --> 00:50:31,990
probably most<font color="#E5E5E5"> people don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

1099
00:50:29,620 --> 00:50:35,109
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a branch of economics that asks</font>

1100
00:50:31,990 --> 00:50:39,669
the question what signal does a

1101
00:50:35,110 --> 00:50:43,090
particular credential hold let's just

1102
00:50:39,670 --> 00:50:46,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">play a game imagine</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for a second you're</font>

1103
00:50:43,090 --> 00:50:47,980
presented with two resumes on one resume

1104
00:50:46,210 --> 00:50:50,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">is an mba from the university of phoenix</font>

1105
00:50:47,980 --> 00:50:55,030
on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> other one is an mba from harvard</font>

1106
00:50:50,440 --> 00:50:56,980
how does<font color="#CCCCCC"> that what preconceived notions</font>

1107
00:50:55,030 --> 00:50:58,930
did you have about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the two people</font>

1108
00:50:56,980 --> 00:51:01,330
holding those credentials what do those

1109
00:50:58,930 --> 00:51:04,240
credentials say when you see them and

1110
00:51:01,330 --> 00:51:07,270
we've made a mistake for a long time

1111
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:09,970
that certification equals competence it

1112
00:51:07,270 --> 00:51:12,430
doesn't certification is a signal as<font color="#E5E5E5"> Lee</font>

1113
00:51:09,970 --> 00:51:14,799
said for I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> willing to invest in myself</font>

1114
00:51:12,430 --> 00:51:19,060
and I'm willing<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be to announce myself</font>

1115
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:22,120
as part of the community I am saying I

1116
00:51:19,060 --> 00:51:23,980
by getting a cissp I'm sticking my hand

1117
00:51:22,120 --> 00:51:25,990
up and I'm saying I'm a security<font color="#CCCCCC"> person</font>

1118
00:51:23,980 --> 00:51:27,370
and I'm not just<font color="#CCCCCC"> a technical person I</font>

1119
00:51:25,990 --> 00:51:29,649
want to be seen as<font color="#CCCCCC"> a security person</font>

1120
00:51:27,370 --> 00:51:33,040
with some breath that's all it<font color="#CCCCCC"> says</font>

1121
00:51:29,650 --> 00:51:34,660
doesn't say you're any good at it so all

1122
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:37,750
your certifications carrier brand

1123
00:51:34,660 --> 00:51:40,990

1124
00:51:37,750 --> 00:51:42,820
come up<font color="#CCCCCC"> with are all our wisdom and back</font>

1125
00:51:40,990 --> 00:51:45,279
and forth on different talks and

1126
00:51:42,820 --> 00:51:46,870
conferences three key rules or

1127
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:48,970
guidelines to follow when you're

1128
00:51:46,870 --> 00:51:51,490
thinking about making career investments

1129
00:51:48,970 --> 00:51:53,470
right so the first one is this is that

1130
00:51:51,490 --> 00:51:58,540
if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to make yourself better</font>

1131
00:51:53,470 --> 00:52:00,790
that's a good<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing so cissp sans</font>

1132
00:51:58,540 --> 00:52:04,450
training course conference business

1133
00:52:00,790 --> 00:52:06,310

1134
00:52:04,450 --> 00:52:08,770
whatever you decide to do to make

1135
00:52:06,310 --> 00:52:13,029
yourself better hey it could<font color="#CCCCCC"> be golf</font>

1136
00:52:08,770 --> 00:52:15,009
lessons it could be wine tasting

1137
00:52:13,029 --> 00:52:17,229
and that kind of sounds crazy but if

1138
00:52:15,009 --> 00:52:18,789

at all all we're saying is this is that

1157
00:53:01,299 --> 00:53:08,619
if you had to interview one person for<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

development and companies are becoming a

1185
00:54:18,069 --> 00:54:23,019
lot less loyal you know it's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> days</font>

00:54:27,310 --> 00:54:31,990
the company helped define the company

with indigo<font color="#E5E5E5"> the company give them</font>

1192
00:54:31,990 --> 00:54:35,470
leadership training because they give

1193
00:54:34,150 --> 00:54:37,270
them leadership training because they

1194
00:54:35,470 --> 00:54:40,089
already<font color="#CCCCCC"> had picked out the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> next job for</font>

that person companies aren't doing that

1196
00:54:40,090 --> 00:54:47,260
now so whatever that amount is<font color="#E5E5E5"> in your</font>

1197
00:54:44,380 --> 00:54:49,330
mind you have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> think of investment</font>

1198
00:54:47,260 --> 00:54:51,520
like I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know if you're saving up</font>

1199
00:54:49,330 --> 00:54:53,590
for something you should allocate a

1200
00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:57,880
certain component of your compensation

1201
00:54:53,590 --> 00:55:00,610
towards making yourself better because

1202
00:54:57,880 --> 00:55:03,310
if you do that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> will accelerate your</font>

1203
00:55:00,610 --> 00:55:05,470
career you<font color="#E5E5E5"> will eventually earn more</font>

1204
00:55:03,310 --> 00:55:09,190
money significantly more money and

1205
00:55:05,470 --> 00:55:11,799
you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be smarter but don't</font>

1206
00:55:09,190 --> 00:55:15,280
pick investments that are garden variety

1207
00:55:11,800 --> 00:55:17,830
because garden-variety only guarantee

1208
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:20,440
you sustainability<font color="#E5E5E5"> some somebody said</font>

1209
00:55:17,830 --> 00:55:22,750
earlier invest for something unique on

1210
00:55:20,440 --> 00:55:24,850
your resume you know to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be different</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

1211
00:55:22,750 --> 00:55:27,070
differentiate that's a good<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing it is</font>

1212
00:55:24,850 --> 00:55:30,520
a it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> always a good</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thing to have</font>

1213
00:55:27,070 --> 00:55:32,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">something that makes you different so</font>

1214
00:55:30,520 --> 00:55:35,290
you have to think<font color="#E5E5E5"> about you know it was</font>

1215
00:55:32,890 --> 00:55:38,049
a key somebody mentioned sacrifice which

1216
00:55:35,290 --> 00:55:40,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">I thought was great because you know you</font>

1217
00:55:38,050 --> 00:55:42,490
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to start thinking like the two</font>

1218
00:55:40,090 --> 00:55:45,880
components of sacrifice are basically if

1219
00:55:42,490 --> 00:55:47,680
you ask me our money and time I would

1220
00:55:45,880 --> 00:55:51,790
argue that time is more valuable than

1221
00:55:47,680 --> 00:55:53,169
money personally I would argue that but

1222
00:55:51,790 --> 00:55:55,029
you start thinking about when you're

1223
00:55:53,170 --> 00:55:57,040
selecting your career investments right

1224
00:55:55,030 --> 00:55:59,380
these are the things you<font color="#CCCCCC"> should start</font>

1225
00:55:57,040 --> 00:56:01,630
thinking about so what's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be if</font>

1226
00:55:59,380 --> 00:56:04,690
I get this certification or if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I get</font>

1227
00:56:01,630 --> 00:56:06,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">this i do this investment what's going</font>

1228
00:56:04,690 --> 00:56:10,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">to be my payback it's going to be my</font>

1229
00:56:06,940 --> 00:56:15,430
return right and i<font color="#CCCCCC"> think that the you</font>

1230
00:56:10,540 --> 00:56:17,440
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> i put these in order i purposely</font>

1231
00:56:15,430 --> 00:56:19,240
listed these in order<font color="#E5E5E5"> because i think</font>

1232
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:21,340
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> these are the ways you should look</font>

1233
00:56:19,240 --> 00:56:24,790
at things<font color="#E5E5E5"> i don't think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that you should</font>

1234
00:56:21,340 --> 00:56:28,780
do take a career investment strictly for

1235
00:56:24,790 --> 00:56:31,120
money I think you want like I know a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot</font>

1236
00:56:28,780 --> 00:56:35,350
of folks have gone back to get MBAs and

1237
00:56:31,120 --> 00:56:37,390
after they get their MBA what they find

1238
00:56:35,350 --> 00:56:40,100
out is that the job that they come back

1239
00:56:37,390 --> 00:56:42,980
to is the same job that they left

1240
00:56:40,100 --> 00:56:46,130
they don't own any more<font color="#E5E5E5"> money they're a</font>

1241
00:56:42,980 --> 00:56:48,380
little bit further<font color="#E5E5E5"> behind the folks that</font>

1242
00:56:46,130 --> 00:56:53,450
didn't leave the company to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get their</font>

1243
00:56:48,380 --> 00:56:55,280
MBA and they say way I just spent all

1244
00:56:53,450 --> 00:56:57,980
this money I didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> get anything for it</font>

1245
00:56:55,280 --> 00:57:00,920
because they're doing it for the wrong

1246
00:56:57,980 --> 00:57:02,420
reasons so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you know when</font>

1247
00:57:00,920 --> 00:57:04,460
you start thinking about these you know

1248
00:57:02,420 --> 00:57:06,800
I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that money becomes a component I</font>

1249
00:57:04,460 --> 00:57:09,710
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it's an important component I</font>

1250
00:57:06,800 --> 00:57:11,270
mean but when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you start thinking about</font>

1251
00:57:09,710 --> 00:57:14,660
these<font color="#CCCCCC"> things all these things career</font>

1252
00:57:11,270 --> 00:57:17,690
acceleration building experience getting

1253
00:57:14,660 --> 00:57:20,450
more access getting better respect I

1254
00:57:17,690 --> 00:57:21,950
mean you think<font color="#CCCCCC"> about it right you know</font>

1255
00:57:20,450 --> 00:57:23,870
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> think about how companies are making</font>

1256
00:57:21,950 --> 00:57:26,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">decisions for their security leaders</font>

1257
00:57:23,870 --> 00:57:30,500
when they look at<font color="#CCCCCC"> it they're trying to</font>

1258
00:57:26,630 --> 00:57:32,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">say hmm we have a candidate that's done</font>

1259
00:57:30,500 --> 00:57:34,640
the same things in their career as a

1260
00:57:32,210 --> 00:57:38,150
security professional as we've done in

1261
00:57:34,640 --> 00:57:41,600
ours as a CFO chief marketing officer

1262
00:57:38,150 --> 00:57:44,210
chief operations officer vs the person

1263
00:57:41,600 --> 00:57:47,779
who's made investments that don't align

1264
00:57:44,210 --> 00:57:51,350
with anybody else in the boardroom you

1265
00:57:47,780 --> 00:57:53,120
don't want to be unique that much you

1266
00:57:51,350 --> 00:57:56,480
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be able to assimilate to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

1267
00:57:53,120 --> 00:57:58,220
certain set it to a certain extent to

1268
00:57:56,480 --> 00:58:02,780
the people who you'll be ultimately

1269
00:57:58,220 --> 00:58:05,359
trying to impress but you have to have

1270
00:58:02,780 --> 00:58:07,670
that that has to be self-driven you have

1271
00:58:05,360 --> 00:58:09,530
to want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do something don't make</font>

1272
00:58:07,670 --> 00:58:14,210
investments because somebody<font color="#CCCCCC"> else wants</font>

1273
00:58:09,530 --> 00:58:16,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to make them do them for yourself so</font>

1274
00:58:14,210 --> 00:58:19,070
that assimilation is exactly was talking

1275
00:58:16,280 --> 00:58:21,710
about earlier in terms of if you want to

1276
00:58:19,070 --> 00:58:24,230
be a be in a leadership role in security

1277
00:58:21,710 --> 00:58:27,920
these days you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to look more</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like a</font>

1278
00:58:24,230 --> 00:58:30,410

1313
01:00:43,820 --> 01:00:48,170
what drives us right<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean and that I</font>

listening<font color="#CCCCCC"> to people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> too i mean that's</font>

1320
01:00:59,060 --> 01:01:04,220
it's worth it for me<font color="#CCCCCC"> i mean in my own</font>

1321
01:01:01,490 --> 01:01:07,520
just just knowing i mean but i don't

1322

1323
01:01:07,520 --> 01:01:17,090
investments have to align with the

1324
01:01:09,350 --> 01:01:31,520
expectation sir we'll call him the man

1325
01:01:17,090 --> 01:01:33,200
in the orange shirt anonymously depends

1326
01:01:31,520 --> 01:01:35,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">on how much of a masochist you are to</font>

1327
01:01:33,200 --> 01:01:42,259
some extent so is<font color="#E5E5E5"> your friend wearing a</font>

1328
01:01:35,300 --> 01:01:47,210
black shirt right now okay<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay yeah so</font>

1329
01:01:42,260 --> 01:01:50,900
okay so you've gotten a bunch of some

1330
01:01:47,210 --> 01:02:02,290
your friend has gotten a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> work</font>

1331
01:01:50,900 --> 01:02:02,290
dumped on them okay okay

1332
01:02:05,210 --> 01:02:10,160
so I completely<font color="#E5E5E5"> agree and this is</font>

1333
01:02:07,910 --> 01:02:11,390
something I keep going back to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the model</font>

1334
01:02:10,160 --> 01:02:13,310
we were using this morning because I

1335
01:02:11,390 --> 01:02:15,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">think it's a really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> effective model if</font>

1336
01:02:13,310 --> 01:02:20,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">you think about it like a company thinks</font>

1337
01:02:15,770 --> 01:02:22,490
about it often accompany will take less

1338
01:02:20,330 --> 01:02:24,860
on a deal initially with the promise

1339
01:02:22,490 --> 01:02:26,450
that they'll make more later right

1340
01:02:24,860 --> 01:02:28,430
you're not going to you're not going to

1341
01:02:26,450 --> 01:02:30,319
do that indefinitely you're not going to

1342
01:02:28,430 --> 01:02:31,490
lose money<font color="#E5E5E5"> on a deal you're not going to</font>

1343
01:02:30,320 --> 01:02:35,000
you're not going to go into bankruptcy

1344
01:02:31,490 --> 01:02:37,759
to make sure that<font color="#CCCCCC"> that happens but there</font>

1345
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:39,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">is always a good reason to have some</font>

1346
01:02:37,760 --> 01:02:41,900
short-term pain to prove that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can</font>

1347
01:02:39,410 --> 01:02:44,810
handle<font color="#CCCCCC"> the responsibility</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and then after</font>

1348
01:02:41,900 --> 01:02:48,260
some amount of time expand that deal

1349
01:02:44,810 --> 01:02:50,210
larger and get more compensation so so

1350
01:02:48,260 --> 01:02:53,150
here's like my favorite right and I've

1351
01:02:50,210 --> 01:02:55,640
like the hardest thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> for me and owning</font>

1352
01:02:53,150 --> 01:02:57,950
my own business that I thought was going

1353
01:02:55,640 --> 01:02:59,870
to be easy was managing people and it

1354
01:02:57,950 --> 01:03:01,490
took<font color="#CCCCCC"> me like I mean I don't think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

1355
01:02:59,870 --> 01:03:04,520
I'm really<font color="#E5E5E5"> great at it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> now but I'm</font>

1356
01:03:01,490 --> 01:03:07,069
getting better at it right but I think

1357
01:03:04,520 --> 01:03:09,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting thing is that a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

1358
01:03:07,070 --> 01:03:12,710
folks they believe that if I ask<font color="#E5E5E5"> you to</font>

1359
01:03:09,680 --> 01:03:15,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">take on responsibility as soon as I ask</font>

1360
01:03:12,710 --> 01:03:18,350
you to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do that pay me and then I'll go</font>

1361
01:03:15,590 --> 01:03:21,680
do it now the way it really works though

1362
01:03:18,350 --> 01:03:24,950
in business is that I give you the

1363
01:03:21,680 --> 01:03:27,859
opportunity and that's what they have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

1364
01:03:24,950 --> 01:03:30,710
look at is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the opportunity</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to build more</font>

1365
01:03:27,860 --> 01:03:34,760
Skills take on more responsibility and

1366
01:03:30,710 --> 01:03:37,520
show my value once I'm able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do that</font>

1367
01:03:34,760 --> 01:03:41,270
now I've created two forms of value I've

1368
01:03:37,520 --> 01:03:45,830
created internal value and now your

1369
01:03:41,270 --> 01:03:49,670
friend has that's gotten external value

1370
01:03:45,830 --> 01:03:52,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">too so even if your friends current</font>

1371
01:03:49,670 --> 01:03:55,400
employer doesn't see the value that

1372
01:03:52,700 --> 01:03:59,089
person now has more market place value

1373
01:03:55,400 --> 01:04:00,980
so you have to tell your friend with

1374
01:03:59,090 --> 01:04:03,500
three kids to look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at it as an</font>

1375
01:04:00,980 --> 01:04:06,260
opportunity and make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure your friend</font>

1376
01:04:03,500 --> 01:04:09,650
takes his wife out to dinner me

1377
01:04:06,260 --> 01:04:11,510
ultimately ultimately we're not paid on

1378
01:04:09,650 --> 01:04:14,030
our potential were paid on what we've

1379
01:04:11,510 --> 01:04:16,250
done not on<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we're going to do but</font>

1380
01:04:14,030 --> 01:04:18,650
on what we've done I my company doesn't

1381
01:04:16,250 --> 01:04:20,360
get paid based on

1382
01:04:18,650 --> 01:04:22,760
we think you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> gonna be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> good at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

1383
01:04:20,360 --> 01:04:24,800
pen test we get paid because we've

1384
01:04:22,760 --> 01:04:27,170
demonstrated a whole lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of success at</font>

1385
01:04:24,800 --> 01:04:30,830
doing that kind of thing Lee doesn't get

1386
01:04:27,170 --> 01:04:32,450
paid<font color="#E5E5E5"> randomly to hire</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people he gets</font>

1387
01:04:30,830 --> 01:04:33,950
paid you know that's that's why they

1388
01:04:32,450 --> 01:04:36,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">don't hire lead to do pen tests and me</font>

1389
01:04:33,950 --> 01:04:39,770
to recruit<font color="#E5E5E5"> thank God we both we both</font>

1390
01:04:36,950 --> 01:04:42,500
have the potential I'm sure but because

1391
01:04:39,770 --> 01:04:44,750
we've demonstrated that we're good at

1392
01:04:42,500 --> 01:04:47,540
one thing and we have a long<font color="#CCCCCC"> history of</font>

1393
01:04:44,750 --> 01:04:49,580
that we get paid well for it and it's

1394
01:04:47,540 --> 01:04:52,490
it's one of those situations if you're

1395
01:04:49,580 --> 01:04:54,380
not able to demonstrate it yet they're

1396
01:04:52,490 --> 01:04:57,140
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to pay you for it yet and so</font>

1397
01:04:54,380 --> 01:05:02,000
you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that opportunity as as</font>

1398
01:04:57,140 --> 01:05:03,859
a sum as a somewhat variable window to

1399
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:08,180
give yourself<font color="#CCCCCC"> the time to actually</font>

1400
01:05:03,860 --> 01:05:10,850
generate the history to say okay I have

1401

<font color="#E5E5E5">done</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pay me not I could do this</font>

1402
01:05:10,850 --> 01:05:14,509
someday payment you know the biggest

1403
01:05:12,710 --> 01:05:17,120
thing that Isis guys go back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get</font>

01:05:54,800 --> 01:06:00,680
that you've seen<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the past really you</font>

1419
01:05:58,880 --> 01:06:02,780
want to take<font color="#CCCCCC"> them I think it really</font>

1420
01:06:00,680 --> 01:06:05,509
depends a career investments are so

1421
01:06:02,780 --> 01:06:07,340
personal that it depends on the job one

1422
01:06:05,510 --> 01:06:09,290
of the most effective career investments

1423
01:06:07,340 --> 01:06:12,590
I ever did was<font color="#CCCCCC"> I became a certified</font>

1424
01:06:09,290 --> 01:06:14,270
hypnotherapist you're all getting random

1425
01:06:12,590 --> 01:06:16,370
you're all gonna give Mike your money at

1426
01:06:14,270 --> 01:06:18,410
all that's very profitable that way eat

1427
01:06:16,370 --> 01:06:21,259
more popcorn no and it was an incredibly

1428
01:06:18,410 --> 01:06:23,600
profitable thing for me because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I do a</font>

1429
01:06:21,260 --> 01:06:26,480
lot of social engineering<font color="#CCCCCC"> work it tied</font>

1430
01:06:23,600 --> 01:06:31,730
in very directly to what I do it's also

1431
01:06:26,480 --> 01:06:32,600
way out there for this industry<font color="#E5E5E5"> I know</font>

1432
01:06:31,730 --> 01:06:34,400
of three other p

1433
01:06:32,600 --> 01:06:35,600
well in the industry who are like you

1434
01:06:34,400 --> 01:06:39,170
know who are like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we talked about</font>

1435
01:06:35,600 --> 01:06:41,330
being unique some<font color="#E5E5E5"> but but it's personal</font>

1436
01:06:39,170 --> 01:06:43,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">I wouldn't recommend to any of you in</font>

1437
01:06:41,330 --> 01:06:45,380
the audience to go do that because that

1438
01:06:43,370 --> 01:06:47,509
probably wouldn't do you any good so

1439
01:06:45,380 --> 01:06:55,730
let's apply<font color="#CCCCCC"> it to you what do you see as</font>

1440
01:06:47,510 --> 01:06:59,290
your<font color="#E5E5E5"> long-term career goal okay what you</font>

1441
01:06:55,730 --> 01:06:59,290
have an intermediate career goal

1442
01:07:12,369 --> 01:07:18,430
so here's the thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hard to</font>

1443
01:07:15,549 --> 01:07:21,220
put in context what a good investment is

1444
01:07:18,430 --> 01:07:23,890
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> had we had</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a slide in the deck</font>

1445
01:07:21,220 --> 01:07:25,240
earlier with a Yogi Berra quote if you

1446
01:07:23,890 --> 01:07:26,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't know where where you're going</font>

1447
01:07:25,240 --> 01:07:28,779
you're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to you're going to end</font>

1448
01:07:26,980 --> 01:07:30,549
up everywhere something like that I

1449
01:07:28,779 --> 01:07:33,640
remember the quote was but basically you

1450
01:07:30,549 --> 01:07:36,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't have a goal it's really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hard to</font>

1451
01:07:33,640 --> 01:07:38,950
assess the return on investment and

1452
01:07:36,609 --> 01:07:40,660
whether<font color="#CCCCCC"> or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not you can get there yeah</font>

1453
01:07:38,950 --> 01:07:43,348
it's in the planning slides Lisa what's

1454
01:07:40,660 --> 01:07:43,348
up earlier

1455
01:07:55,320 --> 01:07:57,830
up

1456
01:07:59,400 --> 01:08:05,010
so here's the<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing if you want to be in</font>

1457
01:08:02,309 --> 01:08:06,990
management the one of the things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1458
01:08:05,010 --> 01:08:10,529
made me a much more effective manager

1459
01:08:06,990 --> 01:08:13,439
was going and learning about finance go

1460
01:08:10,529 --> 01:08:15,930
take a an entry-level college course on

1461
01:08:13,440 --> 01:08:17,489
accounting so so if you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get</font>

1462
01:08:15,930 --> 01:08:19,799
involved what's a cloud computing and

1463
01:08:17,488 --> 01:08:22,979
study so one inch you know the cloud

1464
01:08:19,799 --> 01:08:25,290
security alliance I'd volunteer for a

1465
01:08:22,979 --> 01:08:27,658
project of some sort that would be a

1466
01:08:25,290 --> 01:08:29,759
very low cost<font color="#E5E5E5"> career investment that you</font>

1467
01:08:27,658 --> 01:08:31,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">will probably get a huge return on if</font>

1468
01:08:29,759 --> 01:08:33,929
you take<font color="#CCCCCC"> it seriously and you're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

1469
01:08:31,830 --> 01:08:36,568
<font color="#E5E5E5">to get around some really smart people I</font>

1470
01:08:33,929 --> 01:08:38,790
mean if you're into application security

1471
01:08:36,569 --> 01:08:41,759
maybe volunteer for an o hospitai

1472
01:08:38,790 --> 01:08:44,278
project I mean those are those are like

1473
01:08:41,759 --> 01:08:56,219
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you might apply to your</font>

1474
01:08:44,279 --> 01:08:58,679
desired area go ahead I think my cissp

1475
01:08:56,219 --> 01:09:01,920
when I got it was really valuable um I

1476
01:08:58,679 --> 01:09:03,870
was four<font color="#CCCCCC"> years</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> into my career and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1477
01:09:01,920 --> 01:09:07,408
was an increment back then I was like

1478
01:09:03,870 --> 01:09:08,608
the 11,000 cissp so the ranking system

1479
01:09:07,408 --> 01:09:12,179
was a little shorter back then so it

1480
01:09:08,609 --> 01:09:16,109
actually meant like was as high as 962

1481
01:09:12,179 --> 01:09:19,140
but not yeah I had<font color="#CCCCCC"> that bad I had that</font>

1482
01:09:16,109 --> 01:09:21,600
bad losing streak so so for me right I

1483
01:09:19,140 --> 01:09:25,049
mean some career I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've been very</font>

1484
01:09:21,600 --> 01:09:28,350
fortunate to have exposure to<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of</font>

1485
01:09:25,049 --> 01:09:31,500
whether it's through my recruiting job

1486
01:09:28,350 --> 01:09:34,770
or through my personal people that I

1487
01:09:31,500 --> 01:09:37,890
know some really successful business

1488
01:09:34,770 --> 01:09:41,460
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> who I've done nothing but listen</font>

1489
01:09:37,890 --> 01:09:43,890
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have breakfast with some have been a</font>

1490
01:09:41,460 --> 01:09:45,929
little bit closer<font color="#E5E5E5"> than others and people</font>

1491
01:09:43,890 --> 01:09:48,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> taken me into the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> development of</font>

1492
01:09:45,929 --> 01:09:50,940
their company the development<font color="#CCCCCC"> of their</font>

1493
01:09:48,029 --> 01:09:53,609
people their challenges so I can't say

1494
01:09:50,939 --> 01:09:56,790
that that was a structured but I took a

1495
01:09:53,609 --> 01:09:59,610
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of time away from what I did to make</font>

1496
01:09:56,790 --> 01:10:01,920
sure that when I had that<font color="#E5E5E5"> access I was</font>

1497
01:09:59,610 --> 01:10:04,080
able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to utilize that I'll actually put</font>

1498
01:10:01,920 --> 01:10:06,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">it put another one out there because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

1499
01:10:04,080 --> 01:10:09,900
think it's instructive I at one point

1500
01:10:06,840 --> 01:10:13,260
took a job that I absolutely<font color="#E5E5E5"> despised</font>

1501
01:10:09,900 --> 01:10:15,210
for an entire year because I knew I

1502
01:10:13,260 --> 01:10:18,900
spent most<font color="#E5E5E5"> of my career early career</font>

1503
01:10:15,210 --> 01:10:21,270
running rd for a product company that's

1504
01:10:18,900 --> 01:10:23,580
where<font color="#CCCCCC"> i came up one of the security</font>

1505
01:10:21,270 --> 01:10:25,380
vulnerability management vendors<font color="#CCCCCC"> now</font>

1506
01:10:23,580 --> 01:10:28,110
it's been a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of time on the on the</font>

1507
01:10:25,380 --> 01:10:29,940
product vendor side of the world<font color="#CCCCCC"> i had</font>

1508
01:10:28,110 --> 01:10:31,710
been a consultant then<font color="#CCCCCC"> i had been in a</font>

1509
01:10:29,940 --> 01:10:33,570
product<font color="#E5E5E5"> company and I knew if I really</font>

1510
01:10:31,710 --> 01:10:36,690
wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to advance my career I had to</font>

1511
01:10:33,570 --> 01:10:39,480
spend some<font color="#E5E5E5"> time</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> as a customer I had to</font>

1512
01:10:36,690 --> 01:10:41,070
if I really wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get it and I knew</font>

1513
01:10:39,480 --> 01:10:43,110
I wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to run</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my own businesses at</font>

1514
01:10:41,070 --> 01:10:45,420
some point I knew that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was my plan if I</font>

1515
01:10:43,110 --> 01:10:48,210
really wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get why does a sales</font>

1516
01:10:45,420 --> 01:10:49,740
cycle take nine months sometimes why you

1517
01:10:48,210 --> 01:10:51,450
know what are the internal problems I

1518
01:10:49,740 --> 01:10:55,110
had to go<font color="#E5E5E5"> live that for a long</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> time and</font>

1519
01:10:51,450 --> 01:10:57,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">that was the most frustrating year of my</font>

1520
01:10:55,110 --> 01:10:59,610
life it's like method acting it really

1521
01:10:57,330 --> 01:11:02,220
is yeah it was awful it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> absolutely</font>

1522
01:10:59,610 --> 01:11:04,620
awful and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I and said I introduced Mike</font>

1523
01:11:02,220 --> 01:11:06,810
to that<font color="#E5E5E5"> gym he actually did it it's the</font>

1524
01:11:04,620 --> 01:11:09,390
one time he and I work together well you

1525
01:11:06,810 --> 01:11:11,640
know in all offense in all honesty

1526
01:11:09,390 --> 01:11:14,010
though the chief security officer who

1527
01:11:11,640 --> 01:11:17,610
directly hired Mike who they were like

1528
01:11:14,010 --> 01:11:19,470
kindred spirits he actually left his job

1529
01:11:17,610 --> 01:11:21,780
basically like three weeks after Mike

1530
01:11:19,470 --> 01:11:23,070
started and I that was unbeknownst<font color="#CCCCCC"> to me</font>

1531
01:11:21,780 --> 01:11:25,230
yeah I was kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's kind of fun that</font>

1532
01:11:23,070 --> 01:11:28,530
was weird but anyhow but the point is

1533
01:11:25,230 --> 01:11:31,469
sometimes sometimes an investment is the

1534
01:11:28,530 --> 01:11:33,450
next job you take that that was a detour

1535
01:11:31,470 --> 01:11:35,460
on my career path<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I knew precisely</font>

1536
01:11:33,450 --> 01:11:37,679
what I would wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get out of it and</font>

1537
01:11:35,460 --> 01:11:40,410
I knew what I was sacrificing was not a

1538
01:11:37,680 --> 01:11:41,880
fun year um so there's a question<font color="#CCCCCC"> over</font>

1539
01:11:40,410 --> 01:11:47,040
here okay good because we only have like

1540
01:11:41,880 --> 01:11:48,540
five minutes yeah okay yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> thanks um</font>

1541
01:11:47,040 --> 01:11:50,970
not<font color="#CCCCCC"> really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so much of a question but in</font>

1542
01:11:48,540 --> 01:11:53,490
terms of your investment this is going

1543
01:11:50,970 --> 01:11:54,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">back to time into your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> point one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

1544
01:11:53,490 --> 01:11:57,900
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that i have found to be a</font>

1545
01:11:54,720 --> 01:11:59,520
significant advantage of is internal or

1546
01:11:57,900 --> 01:12:00,389
external if you can find a committee

1547
01:11:59,520 --> 01:12:03,300
like with what you were<font color="#CCCCCC"> just talking</font>

1548
01:12:00,390 --> 01:12:05,850
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> on cloud security audit committee</font>

1549
01:12:03,300 --> 01:12:08,250
which generally<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to happen is</font>

1550
01:12:05,850 --> 01:12:11,430
you're going to now be at a peer level

1551
01:12:08,250 --> 01:12:13,950
with individuals that line item wise are

1552
01:12:11,430 --> 01:12:16,740
going to be considerably higher than you

1553
01:12:13,950 --> 01:12:19,080
so you<font color="#CCCCCC"> by direct correlation you're</font>

1554
01:12:16,740 --> 01:12:22,559
you're getting basically free marketing

1555
01:12:19,080 --> 01:12:24,540
for yourself you're creating a network

1556
01:12:22,560 --> 01:12:26,760
and you're also enhancing your skills

1557
01:12:24,540 --> 01:12:28,470

in learning opportunities than others do

01:14:16,170 --> 01:14:20,460
I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the most important thing</font>

1602
01:14:18,570 --> 01:14:22,830
that you can do<font color="#E5E5E5"> earlier your career is</font>

find a place that will give you the

ability to learn that will give you

access and give you ability to maximize

01:14:28,170 --> 01:14:34,770
your value I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that if you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> want you</font>

really tried<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do those things</font>

1610
01:14:40,110 --> 01:14:43,500
I think that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know you can take your</font>
