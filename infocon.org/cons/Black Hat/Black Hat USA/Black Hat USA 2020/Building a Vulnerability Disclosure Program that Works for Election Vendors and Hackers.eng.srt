00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:11,920
all positions worried about security

28
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:16,240
networking and improving the security of

29
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:20,000
our infrastructure

30
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:21,920
hi everybody my name is mark core i'm

31
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,520
the co-founder and chief technology

32
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,280
officer at synac

33
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:26,880
synack is a leader in the crowdsource

34
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,880
security space what we do is

35
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:32,079
is recruit retain and vet a global

36
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:33,840
community of security researchers and

37
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,680
bring them on to our software platform

38
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:36,560
to find

39
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,000
exploitable vulnerabilities in our

40
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,119
customers applications and

41
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:40,240
infrastructure

42
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:41,759
prior to this i was at the national

43
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:43,759
security agency doing

44
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:45,360
hands-on keyboard exploitation

45
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,759
operations and also worked as an analyst

46
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:48,479
and what you

47
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:50,399
realize doing that job is that it really

48
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:52,799
matters the type of team you can bring

49
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:54,720
to bear on a problem

50
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:57,280
and and really focused on the mission

51
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,079
and this

52
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:00,320
this talk is meant to you know help

53
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,680
improve public

54
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,600
awareness of what we're doing to improve

55
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:06,399
the security of our election systems

56
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:08,720
and as the most sacred aspect of our

57
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,479
democracy it's super important and i'm

58
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:11,520
proud to present

59
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,560
uh with esns on this topic on what we

60
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,080
can do to make this better

61
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,319
the relationship between the security

62
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:19,360
vendors

63
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,120
the security research community the

64
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,560
election vendors

65
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:25,280
and overall the federal government local

66
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,720
and state governments to make

67
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,959
our elections the most secure uh that

68
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:30,080
they can be

69
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,000
uh prior to this i also worked in the in

70
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,840
the government at defense information

71
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,200
systems agency

72
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,840
um and and in that role in a command and

73
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:38,480
control

74
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:41,440
capacity as a systems engineer you start

75
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:42,640
to realize that

76
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:45,280
everything is connected everything is

77
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:47,040
interconnected and intertwined and we

78
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,200
must take a comprehensive approach

79
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,680
to securing our infrastructure next

80
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:54,000
slide

81
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,720
the state of election security is

82
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,720
definitely improving especially in the

83
00:02:58,720 --> 00:02:59,519
relationship

84
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:01,599
with security researchers you know if

85
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:04,480
you take a look back at the early 2000s

86
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:07,760
we had the the election in florida uh in

87
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,120
the in the 2000

88
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,360
presidential election where we had some

89
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,120
issues with hanging chats

90
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:16,560
and this you know led us to move from a

91
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:19,280
physical ballot to more of an electronic

92
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,800
method for counting

93
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:24,000
and tallying our votes this

94
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,360
you know led to the establishment of the

95
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,040
election assistance commission

96
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:30,560
and over the years we have seen that

97
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,640
more electronic voting is more prevalent

98
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,560
and you can vote online you can vote by

99
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:34,959
mail

100
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:36,560
using online registration and voter

101
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,959
registration databases it's all moving

102
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:42,000
into the internet era um one of the

103
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:42,799
things that

104
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:44,480
you know this this timeline is meant to

105
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,000
show though is that

106
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,560
this is all intertwined the evolution of

107
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,080
voting infrastructure

108
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,560
and the relationship of the government

109
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,400
uh with the security research community

110
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:54,879
is all

111
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:56,879
intermingled and what we're looking at

112
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:59,040
over the last 20 years but specifically

113
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,319
in 2016 is

114
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:01,920
the federal government launches the hack

115
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,519
the pentagon program to start working

116
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:05,200
with security researchers

117
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,200
on critical infrastructure on defense

118
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,439
systems you know leveraging that talent

119
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:10,959
in a crowd-sourced way

120
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:13,040
to find vulnerabilities that an

121
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,159
adversary could find

122
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:16,639
but we're trying to find them in advance

123
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:18,720
and if you apply this to our elections

124
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,079
infrastructure

125
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:21,918
it's also designated as critical

126
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:24,080
infrastructure by dhs

127
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,080
in response to russian interference in

128
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:29,440
the 2018 and 2016 elections

129
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,040
you know so what we're seeing is you

130
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,479
know there is a

131
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:34,160
a match made in heaven here between the

132
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,000
security research community

133
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,919
and the the government bodies that

134
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:39,919
manage our elections infrastructure

135
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:41,600
and what we're trying to do is advance

136
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,040
that and

137
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,960
improve that collaboration because it

138
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,639
can be quite valuable

139
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:48,479
um you're seeing that the security

140
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:50,160
vendors are

141
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:53,360
you know actually stepping up to offer

142
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,520
pro bono services to states as well

143
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:58,240
you know microsoft launches a bug bounty

144
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:58,720
on this

145
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:02,000
in in 2019 on election guard um synack

146
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:02,240
and

147
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,400
and cloudflare offering you know pro

148
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,080
bono services to states which we're

149
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,600
going to get into more later

150
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,160
um itisac starts to recognize that this

151
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,759
is such an important issue for the

152
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:13,039
general public that

153
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:16,240
we must have an answer for how we're

154
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,759
going to do vulnerability disclosure

155
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:18,400
programs

156
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:21,600
with election security in mind

157
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,440
and how we're going to integrate the

158
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,800
vendor relationship and the

159
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,639
researcher researchers that are out

160
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:28,160
there doing great work

161
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,800
into a more comprehensive solution and

162
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:31,919
this has led to

163
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:34,000
you know darpa getting involved and

164
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,160
really advancing the state of the art

165
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,080
in computer security which we're going

166
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,759
to touch on as well because it's highly

167
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:41,280
integrated with some of the

168
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,960
the voter registration systems and

169
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,440
protecting that critical infrastructure

170
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:46,479
and then we're going to talk about the

171
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:48,880
esn s partnership and what esns is doing

172
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:49,680
to really

173
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,280
improve their relationship with security

174
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:52,720
researchers

175
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,720
overall though this is dramatically

176
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,319
improved uh given

177
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:58,639
public pressure on on election security

178
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:00,240
and uh the voting

179
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:03,520
uh you know voting systems

180
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,120
being a primary target for our

181
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,120
adversaries this is this is something

182
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:09,440
that should not be overlooked

183
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,759
um and and i'm glad to see it improving

184
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:13,440
now with all that in mind i'd like to

185
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,720
touch on what

186
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:17,759
uh crowdsource security actually is

187
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:19,600
there's a lot of a lot of terms floating

188
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,120
around and i want to make sure we level

189
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,720
set before we jump into

190
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,160
you know what this can actually mean in

191
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,400
practice in general

192
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,840
you know the you start out with

193
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:28,880
something called a vulnerability

194
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,240
disclosure program

195
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,960
and these are basic policies and

196
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,800
procedures for

197
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,720
external security researchers to report

198
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,319
vulnerabilities to

199
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:41,520
uh vendors uh to you know the government

200
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,280
and and this is a see something say

201
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:44,880
something equivalent

202
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:47,440
your your c an issue you report it then

203
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,680
we evolved that model to an open bug

204
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:50,960
bounty model where

205
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,720
researchers are compensated for their

206
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,080
findings they're given

207
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,639
a payment for finding and this is

208
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:57,840
allowing us to

209
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:00,000
incentivize that research a little bit

210
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,039
more

211
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:04,240
but there's a there's a lot less control

212
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,160
and if you need a model that is very

213
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,319
focused on specific use cases or you

214
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:09,919
have sensitive systems that you're not

215
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:10,960
willing to put

216
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,639
on the external internet you might move

217
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:13,919
to the next model which is an

218
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:15,440
invite-only bug bounty

219
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,759
which allows us to you know privately

220
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:19,360
select a crowd of researchers with

221
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,720
specific skills

222
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,160
and incentivize them to go after

223
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,840
specific attack factors that are of

224
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,360
particular interest

225
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,880
maybe maybe things that have come up in

226
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,240
our threat modeling that we know the

227
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,360
adversaries are

228
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:32,880
are focused on this is primarily what

229
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:35,599
um what has been used by the by the

230
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:37,039
pentagon and by other government

231
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:39,199
agencies on critical infrastructure

232
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:41,759
and then this model evolves to a more

233
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:43,520
comprehensive offering that

234
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,360
that i like to call manage crowdsource

235
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,520
pen testing you know pen testing has

236
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:50,400
pro traditionally been an approach uh

237
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,479
led by consultants where a consultant

238
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:54,800
comes in and runs through a checklist

239
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,720
and you know compares that checklist to

240
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,080
you know various compliance standards

241
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:00,240
whether it's nist 853

242
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:03,840
or pci and that's great but it also

243
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:06,479
in this model also integrates open

244
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:08,240
vulnerability discovery where we're able

245
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,800
to incentivize researchers

246
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,360
to find vulnerabilities that are

247
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,039
interesting and also

248
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:17,360
you know exploitable then we also

249
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,800
integrate into this model

250
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:21,039
automated scanning there's definitely a

251
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:22,400
place for automated vulnerability

252
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,479
scanning and the integration of the open

253
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:25,440
volume discovery

254
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,280
the automated scanning and the

255
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,520
compliance driven checklist approach is

256
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:30,800
is what makes this model

257
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,719
quite different and more comprehensive

258
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:34,080
in addition you layer in

259
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,000
analytics and auditability and

260
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
trackability with firm controls over the

261
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,120
rules of engagement

262
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,919
to get the most comprehensive matrix

263
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:43,679
team approach to

264
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:46,800
to your pen test thanks mark

265
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:49,200
i am proud of the work the progress that

266
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,320
esns has made

267
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:53,680
to establish an internal vulnerability

268
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,839
uh disclosure program

269
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:58,640
to communicate those the availability of

270
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,959
that program and to collaborate with

271
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:03,600
researchers that collaboration is

272
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,640
working

273
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:07,360
and we i have four quick examples to

274
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,640
share with you today

275
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,959
about how researchers are not waiting

276
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:13,279
for a policy to put in place

277
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:15,200
they are actively working on election

278
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,800
security issues

279
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,360
and i'm proud to report uh that that

280
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,640
collaboration

281
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:24,160
is working i'd also like to point out

282
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,920
that crowdsource pen testing at the

283
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:26,720
state level

284
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:29,360
is in play the state of colorado is

285
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,640
working with synac

286
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:33,279
uh to pen test to use crowdsource pen

287
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:34,080
testing

288
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,320
specifically as a crucial part of their

289
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,000
cyber security program

290
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,240
i'm quoting the colorado secretary of

291
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,320
state chief information officer

292
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:45,279
trevor timmons where synack is making

293
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:47,200
inroads and working with states

294
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,040
specifically to improve

295
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:52,240
the election security posture of

296
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:55,600
state election systems my first example

297
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,600
is the citrix net scalar

298
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,240
widely advertised back in december and

299
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,079
january of 2020

300
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:04,160
a researcher by the name of jack cable

301
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:06,320
well-known well-respected part of

302
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,160
hack the pentagon and other important

303
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,440
initiatives

304
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:12,800
reached out to esns to alert us to a

305
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:15,839
citrix netscaler vpn

306
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:19,120
potential vulnerability with malware

307
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:22,079
we worked with jack to identify the the

308
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:23,680
vulnerability the device

309
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:27,120
that was involved and to ensure

310
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,200
that a vulnerability a patch of

311
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,200
mitigation was in place

312
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:35,360
and then test it jack was very effective

313
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,440
and professional in communicating with

314
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:40,480
esns he was uh helped us

315
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,920
understand the vulnerability the

316
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:44,079
seriousness of it explained

317
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:47,440
uh his uh

318
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,680
the way that he used to uh find that

319
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:52,160
vulnerability and then work with us

320
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:54,959
to mitigate it

321
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:58,240
example two comes from two professional

322
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,000
researchers kevin scoglin and

323
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,440
tony adams kevin and tony worked for

324
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:04,320
about a year

325
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,640
scanning the internet using a

326
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:07,839
methodology that

327
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:10,640
you can see on the slide here to scan

328
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:11,600
for

329
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:14,959
ports 22 and 443 that

330
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:16,560
with specific responses could

331
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:19,279
fingerprint firewalls that may be used

332
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:20,720
by election officials in the

333
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:23,279
communication of unofficial results

334
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:25,760
because without proper security controls

335
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:28,079
or misconfigurations

336
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:31,040
these devices could be vulnerable to

337
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,240
abuse

338
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:35,760
by external threat actors we worked with

339
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:39,839
kevin and tony who also reported these

340
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:42,720
issues to the e i i isac to customers

341
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:43,920
and to dhs

342
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:46,720
we worked with this group to make sure

343
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,560
and help our customers

344
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:52,079
address this vulnerability

345
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:54,079
example three also comes from kevin

346
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:55,760
scotland and tony adams

347
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:58,399
they did a great job reviewing the

348
00:11:58,399 --> 00:11:59,920
documentation that

349
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:02,320
election technology vendors submit to

350
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,000
the eac

351
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,839
in anticipation of a certification event

352
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:09,360
kevin and tony reviewed this

353
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:12,079
documentation and and discovered that a

354
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:14,079
certain model of a zebra

355
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:17,200
qr code scanner uh out of the box

356
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,920
uh coming direct from the factory could

357
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,200
have a vulnerability

358
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:24,240
when using configuration barcodes these

359
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,560
are special manufacturer divine barcodes

360
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:28,480
which can be scanned by the scanner

361
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:31,600
to perform perform ad administrative

362
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:35,519
functions kevin and tony alerted us to

363
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:36,320
this

364
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,880
and working together we reviewed our

365
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:41,279
implementation of these zebra scanners

366
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:44,639
to make sure that our our implementation

367
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:46,720
did not or would not be susceptible to

368
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,000
this vulnerability

369
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,040
and we actually used kevin's suggestion

370
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,320
about how to mitigate this

371
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,720
recommendation so i i thank kevin and

372
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:55,839
tony

373
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:58,399
for their proactive approach to working

374
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:00,639
with technology manufacturers

375
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:02,560
to ensure that we're doing everything as

376
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:04,720
securely as we can be

377
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:07,519
my final example comes from a a high

378
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:10,079
school kid named hunter osmera

379
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:12,959
hunter was reviewing uh voter view

380
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:14,880
application websites

381
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:17,040
and found that if he put random

382
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,160
characters

383
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:21,600
into the name fields of a voter lookup

384
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:24,720
uh website that he could return

385
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:28,560
uh names and voter information of

386
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,959
voters in that jurisdiction kevin

387
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:32,000
alerted us to this

388
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,560
uh function this vulnerability and we

389
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:35,839
worked with him to

390
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:38,639
make sure that special characters would

391
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:39,600
be ignored

392
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:42,160
and the search parameter tightened up to

393
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:44,240
make sure that only

394
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,639
authentic characters input into these

395
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:49,920
fields would return the desired results

396
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:53,120
hunter as i mentioned a high school kid

397
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:55,760
proactive professional willing to work

398
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:58,160
with the technology manufacturer

399
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:00,639
to ensure that our systems are as secure

400
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:02,320
as they can be

401
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,079
very important now but especially

402
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:05,440
important as we move

403
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:08,720
towards november

404
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,880
thank you chris as you can see there are

405
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,399
a lot of vulnerabilities up and down the

406
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:13,199
stack

407
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:15,360
here from everything from from code

408
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,240
readers

409
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:18,959
to you know voter registration systems

410
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:20,639
to voter registration databases these

411
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:22,480
are very complex systems

412
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,959
uh that are interwoven and you know to

413
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:26,639
tackle such a problem is that we really

414
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:27,519
need

415
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:29,519
an aggressive approach that allows us to

416
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:31,519
be as comprehensive as possible and it

417
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:33,199
is a united effort

418
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:35,040
across the vendor community the the

419
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,800
government community and the researchers

420
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,079
in order to do this

421
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:40,639
in order to further this uh cenac is

422
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:41,519
going to launch

423
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:43,360
secure the election initiative that is

424
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:44,959
updated to include vulnerability

425
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:46,560
disclosure programs

426
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:49,600
as well as a pro bono penetration test

427
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,920
included in this package this is going

428
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:52,800
to help us

429
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:55,680
push for the idea that states should be

430
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:57,120
working with

431
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,279
that external researcher community to

432
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:00,800
find these vulnerabilities ahead of the

433
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:03,040
adversary and help make our elections

434
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:06,160
the most secure they can be this is not

435
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:08,800
a a new initiative but it is updated to

436
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:09,839
include

437
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:12,160
even more comprehensive penetration

438
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:13,040
testing

439
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:15,040
with a crowd of researchers and

440
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,720
incentivized discovery

441
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:19,600
so this is a way for us to help the

442
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,760
states move into a modern era of pen

443
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:22,800
testing and

444
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:25,519
follow the lead that colorado has set by

445
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:26,000
moving

446
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,920
and making this part of their core

447
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:30,399
security platform

448
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:32,000
the end result will hopefully be

449
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,680
vulnerabilities found ahead of

450
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:35,519
our adversaries and a more secure

451
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:40,880
elections infrastructure

452
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:42,320
that said i want to talk a little bit

453
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,480
about the future where do we go

454
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:47,600
to secure uh the future of our elections

455
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,040
infrastructure beyond just better

456
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:51,519
collaboration between researchers and

457
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:54,240
the vendors the defense advanced

458
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:56,480
research projects agency

459
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:59,040
has been working on a very interesting

460
00:15:59,040 --> 00:15:59,920
project

461
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:02,639
to integrate formal methods a formal

462
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:03,199
valid

463
00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:06,720
validation of uh pro program flow

464
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:09,360
into hardware to start to prevent

465
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:10,240
vulnerabilities

466
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:13,040
in software with a hardware approach

467
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:13,920
this program

468
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:16,399
is is really on the cutting edge and is

469
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:17,600
designed to

470
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:20,839
help us eliminate whole classes of

471
00:16:20,839 --> 00:16:22,000
vulnerabilities

472
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,639
from from the average series toolkit

473
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:25,279
this is

474
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:28,240
especially relevant for voting

475
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:29,600
infrastructure and other critical

476
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:30,720
systems

477
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:33,120
as a part of this and to validate that

478
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:33,759
the approach

479
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:36,480
is effective senec will be working with

480
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:37,759
darpa on a

481
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:40,320
bug bounty focused on this and a voter

482
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,360
registration

483
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:44,000
database use case that allows us to

484
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,480
validate that this approach can be used

485
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,240
in that type of model in these types of

486
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,480
systems that esns builds

487
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:52,959
this is meant to advance and further

488
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:53,759
harden

489
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:56,480
these systems against future attacks and

490
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:57,120
just like

491
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:59,279
you know we'd expect from from darpa

492
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:01,199
they're way ahead of the curve here

493
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:03,680
we're excited to work with them to make

494
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:05,280
sure that these hardware

495
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:08,880
vulnerabilities can be implemented

496
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,959
in a way that allows software to be

497
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:12,240
loaded on top of them and

498
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,919
and prevent whole classes of

499
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:15,760
vulnerabilities next i want to go into

500
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:16,640
what those

501
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:19,520
those are this you know this darpa

502
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:20,480
research has

503
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,720
focused on eliminating things like

504
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:24,000
buffer overflows

505
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,079
information leaks anything that that

506
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:27,520
could be done you know at the

507
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:29,440
programmatic level and numeric errors

508
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:30,480
code injection

509
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:33,039
even cryptographic errors that lead to

510
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:34,320
code execution

511
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:35,919
this is going to hopefully allow us to

512
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:37,919
focus on other vulnerability classes

513
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:39,200
like

514
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,200
business logic or functional abuse that

515
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:44,080
may be abused in a fraud type scenario

516
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:46,160
given our focus on on these

517
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:48,080
vulnerabilities and darpa's

518
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:50,880
ability to bring a more hardware driven

519
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,240
approach we're hoping that

520
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:55,200
in time for the the 2024 elections we'll

521
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:55,840
be able to have

522
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:58,840
an even more secure infrastructure for

523
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:00,400
this

524
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:03,200
thanks mark as mark mentioned at the at

525
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,679
the top of the presentation the iti

526
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:08,320
sac uh has taken a special interest in

527
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,400
vulnerability disclosure programs and is

528
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,760
leaning in

529
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:14,240
helped form a election industry special

530
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:15,360
interest group

531
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,440
and has brought a number of election

532
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:19,840
technology providers together

533
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:22,799
to develop a coordinated vulnerability

534
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:25,360
disclosure disclosure program

535
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:27,520
which will move the industry forward

536
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,200
towards a vdp

537
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:31,440
i'm also excited to announce that esn s

538
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:32,960
is partnering with synac

539
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:35,200
to test our newest generation electronic

540
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,240
poll book

541
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,480
these poll books are in wide use across

542
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:39,360
the country

543
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:42,559
they are the perimeter or the front line

544
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:45,600
of election technology where voters

545
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,679
enter a polling place and are checked in

546
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:50,000
using an electronic poll book

547
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,480
we want to make sure that everything

548
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:54,480
that can be done to harden and protect

549
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,320
these electronic poll books

550
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:58,640
and their communications methodology

551
00:18:58,640 --> 00:18:59,360
with a

552
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:02,080
central voter registration database are

553
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:03,600
as absolutely secure

554
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:07,200
as they can be thanks chris we're

555
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,919
excited to get to work on that project

556
00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:12,400
as the next step i'd like to talk about

557
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,760
where we can go

558
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:16,559
next in terms of the policies especially

559
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:18,000
when it comes to the federal testing

560
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:18,880
programs

561
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:21,200
you know there are certainly certainly

562
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:23,120
been a lot of progress made in the last

563
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,679
you know five years on this we certainly

564
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:26,160
have

565
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:28,880
you know seen that researchers can get

566
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,400
involved with the vendors we've seen

567
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,280
that

568
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:32,720
researchers can get involved with the

569
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,000
state and local governments and work

570
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,039
with them to make this

571
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:38,720
more secure you know orchestrated

572
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,640
voting uh election infrastructure

573
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:41,760
however

574
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:43,840
there are more things we can do the

575
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:45,520
testing timelines are

576
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:48,720
are just too elongated we need to have

577
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:51,520
the ability to do continuous testing on

578
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:53,200
these products we need to be able to

579
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,160
push

580
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:57,360
patches to the field very quickly

581
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:59,760
the continuous testing model is is being

582
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:00,720
adapted by

583
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:03,120
adopted by a lot of people and critical

584
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:04,960
infrastructure is a great place to start

585
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:07,039
for this type of testing because

586
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:09,840
we know that it has ramifications if a

587
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:11,760
vulnerability is found and we know that

588
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:13,760
changes need to be

589
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:15,679
you know controlled that makes sense but

590
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:17,039
we also need to be able to validate

591
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:18,320
those changes work

592
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:20,799
and marry that with continuous security

593
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:21,679
testing

594
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:24,240
the incorporation of federal standards

595
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,840
on this type of

596
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:27,760
product is also needed you know right

597
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:30,159
now states do not have to buy

598
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:32,320
voter voter registration systems that

599
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:33,200
are

600
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,880
you know rigorously security tested

601
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:36,559
there's a lot of optional requirements

602
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:37,760
and i think we can move

603
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:39,280
most of the optional requirements to

604
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:41,679
mandatory ones uh with with little

605
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:43,120
downside risk

606
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:45,520
we ought to be able to you know push the

607
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:46,559
envelope here

608
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:49,600
especially on this this type of system

609
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:50,159
where we

610
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:52,640
the the public demands that we deliver a

611
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:54,320
more secure voting infrastructure

612
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:56,400
they do not want to see adversaries

613
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,240
meddle with our elections

614
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:59,919
and we just need we owe it to the

615
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:02,240
general public to do a much better job

616
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:05,200
public awareness is rising and you know

617
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:07,200
if the states and the and the vendors

618
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,480
are more proactive

619
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,240
i think we'll see some very positive

620
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:13,760
results from the general public

621
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:16,159
thanks mark another topic that's closely

622
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:18,400
related to discovering vulnerabilities

623
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:20,320
before our adversaries do

624
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:23,440
are supply chain security considerations

625
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:25,120
and we want to take the last portion of

626
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:25,520
our

627
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:27,120
our presentation here to talk to you

628
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,799
about all that's going on in

629
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:31,360
supply chain security and what esns is

630
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:32,000
doing

631
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,080
to make sure that the parts that we use

632
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,120
in our equipment

633
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:38,480
are absolutely secure and trustworthy

634
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:40,559
our product life cycle begins at the

635
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:43,280
design phase when we

636
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:45,600
develop requirements in conjunction with

637
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,440
what our customers those state and local

638
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:48,159
election

639
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:50,320
officials are demanding in terms of

640
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:51,280
security

641
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:54,880
we put that through a rigorous review we

642
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:57,679
bid for the parts that are used to

643
00:21:57,679 --> 00:21:59,600
develop these systems

644
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,440
we make sure that the development and

645
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:03,760
the quality assurance is absolutely

646
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:05,520
airtight using the highest

647
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:07,679
federal and quality quality assurance

648
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:08,799
standards

649
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:12,159
every machine that we make every every

650
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:14,159
piece of software that we develop goes

651
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:15,280
through rigorous

652
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:17,760
federal testing and certification and

653
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:19,440
then we sustain these uh

654
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:21,840
these pieces of equipment that have

655
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:24,840
generally a 10 or 15 year product life

656
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:26,480
cycle

657
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:28,159
as is the case with many critical

658
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:30,159
infrastructure sectors

659
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:33,280
esns has a global supply chain we work

660
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:34,159
very hard

661
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:36,159
to make sure that each and every part

662
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:38,320
that goes into our equipment

663
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:42,000
is absolutely safe trustworthy

664
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,799
free of malware or manipulation to make

665
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:45,280
sure

666
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:48,240
that when our election technology

667
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:50,480
reaches the customers hands and voters

668
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:51,200
use it

669
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:53,440
they can rest assured that a all the

670
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,600
controls that can be in place to protect

671
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,360
these parts and services

672
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:01,840
are in fact in place and tested

673
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,799
some of the things that we do at esns i

674
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:08,320
personally conduct a

675
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:11,440
a review of our supplier partners

676
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:14,640
supply chains i have visited these sites

677
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:17,120
where these components are made to

678
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:18,480
ensure that

679
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:22,960
no malware is is nefariously implanted

680
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:25,520
on these device no rogue or counterfeit

681
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:29,039
components i i take pictures i i review

682
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:29,440
these

683
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:32,640
uh my surveys and supply chain reviews

684
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,640
uh with our engineering and management

685
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:36,960
team to make sure number one that our

686
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,640
suppliers are doing everything that they

687
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:40,720
are contractually required to do

688
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:43,039
and two is there anything else that we

689
00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:44,080
can look at

690
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:46,799
or or ask for that helps ensure the

691
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:49,200
security of the supply chain

692
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:52,159
the audits that i do are both on-site uh

693
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:54,480
with the manufacturers teams

694
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:58,320
and through surveys and reviews that we

695
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:00,080
conduct remotely

696
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:02,000
and then spot check to make sure that

697
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,440
our manufacturers

698
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:07,039
are providing pristine malware-free

699
00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:09,679
components

700
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:12,799
once all these parts come together in

701
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:13,840
omaha

702
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:15,919
we have several teams that review them

703
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:17,200
and we do something

704
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:19,440
extra that i think you'll find very

705
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:20,240
interesting

706
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:22,640
we take a random sample of these parts

707
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:24,799
and we extract any firmware

708
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:27,039
and review it against a golden standard

709
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:28,640
to make sure that the firmware is not

710
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,080
manipulated or

711
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:33,120
uh somehow uh

712
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:36,320
nefariously changed to induce an

713
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:38,000
undesired result

714
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,919
we check our programmable logic devices

715
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:43,120
to make sure

716
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:45,520
that they only contain the firmware that

717
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:46,799
we authorize

718
00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:49,760
and nothing else

719
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
i would be remiss if i didn't mention

720
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,880
that the dhs

721
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:57,679
sysa and the election task force have

722
00:24:57,679 --> 00:24:58,720
produced

723
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:00,640
a number of guidelines for state and

724
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:02,799
local officials to

725
00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:06,480
learn about and help work through supply

726
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:06,960
chain

727
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:10,640
management issues i invite everybody

728
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:12,880
on this presentation to take a look at

729
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:14,480
what dhs

730
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:16,559
sysa and the election task force have

731
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:18,799
produced when it comes to ensuring that

732
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:19,919
the supply chain

733
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:23,120
of the technology provided by the

734
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:26,000
vendors is absolutely trustworthy

735
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,080
there's a lot of good information that

736
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:30,080
cisa and the election task force has put

737
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:32,799
out uh in the last several months

738
00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:35,200
of course related to covet and managing

739
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,279
elections during a pandemic

740
00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:38,960
but they have a deep history a deep

741
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:41,360
experience in a number of critical

742
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:42,240
infrastructure

743
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:45,440
security initiatives please check out

744
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:45,760
the

745
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:49,279
dhs sysa website and look at

746
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:51,360
all the products that they have produced

747
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:53,200
regarding vulnerability disclosure

748
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:57,039
and supply chain security and with that

749
00:25:57,039 --> 00:25:58,559
mark and i would like to take your

750
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:00,720
questions

i think we're on mark

752
00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:11,840
do we have any questions

review for us any questions that may

756
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:21,760
have been submitted during the

757
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:22,840
presentation

758
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:28,240

chris i think you've got a few in the in

761
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:49,440
the queue here

762
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:54,240
i am not seeing those uh

763
00:26:55,440 --> 00:27:07,840
i've got both uh both screens up

764
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:37,760
i see the live discussion now and the

765
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:40,399
questions

766
00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:46,480
uh i'll go ahead first uh michael

767
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:48,640
asks what is the sns done to ensure that

768
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:50,720
patches created from the disclosure

769
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:52,480
program are applied

770
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:55,279
by local effect election officials

771
00:27:55,279 --> 00:27:56,880
michael when a vulnerability is

772
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:58,480
disclosed to us

773
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:01,600
and we determine that it is valid and

774
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:02,000
affects

775
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,799
uh equipment in the field uh we work

776
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:05,679
hard with

777
00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:08,240
the uh a product team to develop a

778
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:10,080
mitigation and test it to make sure that

779
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:11,679
it doesn't break anything

780
00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:14,720
uh that we then apply it to uh if

781
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,880
required to the uh

782
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:19,600
voting system test lab so that they can

783
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:21,279
test it to make sure that it doesn't

784
00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:24,720
uh uh uh

785
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:27,279
undo any uh functionality any

786
00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:29,440
environmental controls any

787
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:31,440
accessibility controls and then we

788
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:32,960
package that together

789
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:36,080
uh to the eac for approval where

790
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:36,960
appropriate

791
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:39,440
and then we shotgun it out to uh to our

792
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:41,760
customers in one of two ways

793
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:45,440
we deliver the patch to the customer

794
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:49,440
via physical media or in some cases

795
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:52,720
we will let that patch

796
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:55,520
we transmit that patch to customers who

797
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:57,360
are able to do so through a secure file

798
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:58,240
transfer

799
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:00,799
and they can apply it on their own but

800
00:29:00,799 --> 00:29:01,919
in either case

801
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:03,919
we don't send those patches over the

802
00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:06,640
internet or over the wire or anything

803
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:09,600
they are they are delivered via physical

804
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:10,480
media

805
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:13,760
or encapsulated in an sft

806
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:15,840
a secure file transfer encrypted and

807
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:17,520
then sent to customers

808
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:22,080
i hope that answers your question

809
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:26,480
next question uh for me looks like it

810
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:27,840
comes from harley

811
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:29,919
asking will esns commit to supporting

812
00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:31,760
protections for security researchers

813
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:33,600
under the dmca

814
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:36,480
the answer to that is yes today during

815
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:38,799
our presentation the esn s

816
00:29:38,799 --> 00:29:40,480
coordinated vulnerability disclosure

817
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:42,000
program was

818
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,240
posted to our website on the security

819
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:47,840
page if you go to esnsvote.com

820
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:49,840
uh go to the security page and scroll

821
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:51,279
down you'll see

822
00:29:51,279 --> 00:29:54,559
a a website and a link to our cvdp

823
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:58,080
policy which does uh exempt

824
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:00,720
security researchers and provides safe

825
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:01,600
harbor

826
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:04,799
uh for those provisions of the dmca so

827
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:09,840
that we can work together

828
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:14,320
next question is from joe joe asks if

829
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:16,720
esns currently has a vdp and is it

830
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:19,279
available online yes

831
00:30:19,279 --> 00:30:22,000
we have posted that policy online we've

832
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:22,720
been doing

833
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:25,919
vdp with synac and others for

834
00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:28,480
some time and we expect this partnership

835
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:29,600
to grow

836
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:31,840
especially as a regards as it relates to

837
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:34,240
synac our partnership with them

838
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:36,480
testing electronic poll books is the

839
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:37,919
first step and what i hope is a

840
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:40,480
continuing partnership

841
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:43,200
to test to conduct electing election

842
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:46,240
security testing

843
00:30:49,039 --> 00:30:52,080
scrolling down uh joe asks again

844
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:53,919
where do you stand on an industry-wide

845
00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:55,200
vdp joe

846
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:57,679
our discussions with the iti sac and

847
00:30:57,679 --> 00:30:58,799
other vendors

848
00:30:58,799 --> 00:31:01,039
have uh have shown us that it's a lot

849
00:31:01,039 --> 00:31:02,080
harder to

850
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:05,039
produce a vdp for the industry than it

851
00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:07,279
is for the individual companies

852
00:31:07,279 --> 00:31:09,279
so uh individual companies were

853
00:31:09,279 --> 00:31:11,519
encouraged to establish vdp

854
00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:14,880
to work with uh companies like uh synac

855
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:16,559
if they choose to do so because they

856
00:31:16,559 --> 00:31:18,080
have access to a

857
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:19,919
very good talent pool of security

858
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:22,000
researchers that's what esns

859
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,399
is doing

860
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:33,840
over to you joe

861
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:44,840
i'm looking for other questions in the

862
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:47,840
chat

863
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:49,760
i think that answers them you know the

864
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:52,480
end the end goal here is

865
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:54,080
setting the talk as chris just mentioned

866
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:56,000
is to set up a full program testing an

867
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,600
end-to-end system and

868
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:59,120
you know this is starting with the

869
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:00,559
electronic poll book but we're going to

870
00:32:00,559 --> 00:32:01,440
hopefully

871
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:02,960
be able to expand this over time to

872
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:04,799
include a full end to end system of the

873
00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:05,840
esns stack

874
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:07,919
and while it's a very complicated thing

875
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:09,120
to set up

876
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:10,720
we're excited to get researchers

877
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:13,600
involved and really make a difference

878
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:16,240
the state of our election security

879
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:16,960
thanks joe

880
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:20,720
i just see a new question from eric eric

881
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:23,760
apologize for the confusing comments

882
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:27,519
esns has been doing vdp for a while

883
00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:29,760
uh going back 18 months or more we have

884
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:31,279
been in contact with security

885
00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:32,480
researchers

886
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:36,399
who have posted uh or alerted us to

887
00:32:36,399 --> 00:32:37,519
vulnerabilities

888
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:39,919
and we've been working on those uh and

889
00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:41,679
communicating with security researchers

890
00:32:41,679 --> 00:32:42,159
for

891
00:32:42,159 --> 00:32:44,559
more than 18 months the partnership with

892
00:32:44,559 --> 00:32:46,320
synac is new

893
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:48,080
last month we signed a contract with

894
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:49,600
synac to conduct

895
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:51,519
security testing of our electronic poll

896
00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:53,120
books and we believe that

897
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:55,600
is the first step in a partnership with

898
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:56,320
synac

899
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:58,240
i hope that helps i apologize for the

900
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:00,720
confusion

901
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:08,159
i can take the uh the next one here from

902
00:33:08,159 --> 00:33:09,360
from brian

903
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:11,519
uh the mo the model definitely works for

904
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:13,279
aviation vendors as well i mean we

905
00:33:13,279 --> 00:33:15,200
we've done this with uh with the air

906
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:16,320
force and

907
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:19,039
and different aviation companies um and

908
00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:20,159
and the model is

909
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:21,919
is such that you want to get things set

910
00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:23,360
up you want to have a simulation or

911
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:24,960
emulation of the system

912
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:26,799
and be able to get a full end-to-end

913
00:33:26,799 --> 00:33:29,360
test as close to the near production

914
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:30,559
system as you can

915
00:33:30,559 --> 00:33:32,480
and that that model can be applied to a

916
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:38,880
variety of industries

917
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:40,799
i see another question from joe where do

918
00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:43,360
we stand on the industry-wide bdp and

919
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:45,120
do i have an estimate on when that will

920
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:46,960
come i really don't joe

921
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:50,640
uh the iti sac is coordinating this

922
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:52,240
effort for the industry

923
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:55,279
and we meet regularly to discuss

924
00:33:55,279 --> 00:33:58,559
the uh the methods in which we establish

925
00:33:58,559 --> 00:34:01,440
a vdp for the industry

926
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:03,200
we have a number of different members

927
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:05,279
who are in different

928
00:34:05,279 --> 00:34:08,719
places of maturity esns has had a

929
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:11,359
vulnerability ingestion and processing

930
00:34:11,359 --> 00:34:13,520
evaluation

931
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:16,719
workflow for some time other election

932
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:19,679
technology providers are just getting to

933
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:23,520
to have a that process in place

934
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:25,760
you must have the process in place to

935
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:27,520
ingest evaluate

936
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:29,599
and then act upon vulnerabilities before

937
00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:31,199
you open the door

938
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:33,520
to allow those reports to come in and

939
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:34,960
then i want to

940
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:37,520
re-emphasize something that mark said we

941
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:39,040
still need the eac

942
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:42,639
to work with election officials and

943
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:46,639
vendors and provide a path for the rapid

944
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:49,760
ingestion and patching if it's needed

945
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:53,599
that that has not come to fruition yet

946
00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:55,520
but the eac and their partners are

947
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:57,440
working very hard on it

948
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:00,000
and once they do we think that will be a

949
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,599
gateway

950
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:04,240
to allow for security researchers

951
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:06,000
working under cbdp

952
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:09,119
policy uh under the safe harbor rules

953
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:11,119
and meeting our expectations and us

954
00:35:11,119 --> 00:35:11,839
theirs

955
00:35:11,839 --> 00:35:14,000
be able to communicate vulnerabilities

956
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,240
that uh

957
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:20,240
that are can be acted upon quickly

958
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:24,960
uh next question looks like it's from

959
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:25,520
kim

960
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:28,000
she asks chris how does the sns do a

961
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,520
spot check on firmware to make sure it

962
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:30,720
hasn't changed

963
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:32,480
can you describe that verification

964
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:33,839
progress yes

965
00:35:33,839 --> 00:35:37,599
uh so we work with our manufacturers to

966
00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:40,800
establish the golden build or the

967
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:44,480
the firmware uh golden edition

968
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:47,040
to to make sure that we check it line by

969
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:49,040
line to make sure that any firmware

970
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:51,599
has only what we place in there and

971
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:52,720
nothing else

972
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:55,599
we deposit that firmware we escrow it in

973
00:35:55,599 --> 00:35:57,359
a couple of different places

974
00:35:57,359 --> 00:35:59,200
and then when the hardware comes to

975
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:01,520
omaha for final assembly

976
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:04,079
we do a statistically random sample of

977
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:04,800
equipment

978
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:07,440
we take that equipment off of the truck

979
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:09,280
after its final assembly

980
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:12,800
we we have a third uh security company

981
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:14,960
extract the firmware from those uh

982
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:16,000
components

983
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,560
and compare it against the golden build

984
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:20,560
uh and then they tell us they they give

985
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:21,760
us reports

986
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:25,200
of uh of how complete how accurate

987
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:27,119
uh have there been any changes and so

988
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:29,359
far well that program has been in place

989
00:36:29,359 --> 00:36:32,400
about 18 months and all of the equipment

990
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:33,920
that we have checked have not had

991
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:34,960
firmware

992
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:38,880
uh manipulated or otherwise

993
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:41,440
otherwise changed from the golden build

994
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:42,480
that

995
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:44,800
that we have established hope that

996
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:55,839
answers your question

997
00:37:09,359 --> 00:37:11,760
uh mark over to you for uh closing

998
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:13,839
comments

999
00:37:13,839 --> 00:37:16,400
yeah i you know i just want to recognize

1000
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:16,960
you know

1001
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:20,839
historically i know there's been some

1002
00:37:20,839 --> 00:37:24,000
um you know some consternation

1003
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,359
you know with the researcher community

1004
00:37:25,359 --> 00:37:27,440
on on how this is tested you know how

1005
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:28,480
open it is

1006
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:31,040
and and this is a this is a process and

1007
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:32,079
this is a great

1008
00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:35,520
uh first step uh for esns and and we're

1009
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:38,800
excited to work with them on this um and

1010
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:40,400
you know we recognize this is an

1011
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:42,000
important problem uh

1012
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,839
for our country and we need to make sure

1013
00:37:43,839 --> 00:37:45,440
that we get it

1014
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:48,480
as open as we can within the constraints

1015
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:48,880
that

1016
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:51,359
that makes sense for a commercial entity

1017
00:37:51,359 --> 00:37:53,760
and for such sensitive equipment

1018
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:56,320
so i think we're on the right path we

1019
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:57,440
recognize we're not

1020
00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:00,000
where we want to be yet but we're making

1021
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:00,880
strides to

1022
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:02,720
to make the process of working with

1023
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:05,040
researchers on such sensitive equipment

1024
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:07,520
more streamlined uh more scalable and

1025
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:08,480
more

1026
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:11,520
uh i you know just just more mimicking

1027
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:13,200
what the adversary is going to do to us

1028
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:15,119
and that's that's the key to this whole

1029
00:38:15,119 --> 00:38:17,200
