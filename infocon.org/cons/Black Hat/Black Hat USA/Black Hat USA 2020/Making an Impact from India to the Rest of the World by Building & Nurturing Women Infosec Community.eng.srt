00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:16,320
hi everyone today's talk is about making

3
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:16,560
an

4
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,080
impact from india to the rest of the

5
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:20,400
world by building and nurturing women

6
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,320
infosec community

7
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:23,760
we all know that women are

8
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,439
underrepresented in the information

9
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:28,080
security sector

10
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:30,320
the world average female literacy rate

11
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:32,479
is 79.7

12
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:34,480
while in india the average female

13
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:36,040
literacy rate is just

14
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:39,760
65.46 percent as per women's web

15
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:42,480
in india a million engineers graduate a

16
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:43,200
year

17
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,000
but there are only 10 of them are women

18
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,039
in it

19
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:49,840
now after the 10 percent we will only

20
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:50,320
find

21
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:53,680
0.5 percent in n46 that's how the stats

22
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:55,120
are more or less

23
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:57,280
the ratio in the cyber security teams

24
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:58,879
are really dim

25
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:01,440
everyone knows about it and it's widely

26
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,199
recognized

27
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:05,119
now i have some questions for the women

28
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:06,560
in the audience

29
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:08,400
have you ever felt that you are one

30
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,720
among like thousand people

31
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:12,560
have you ever felt that you needed a

32
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:15,840
mentor but couldn't find one

33
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,240
you wanted to talk to somebody what was

34
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:20,320
hesitant in speaking

35
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:22,960
thinking that or they might judge me or

36
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:24,960
i wouldn't be able to articulate the

37
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:27,520
things well

38
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:29,600
everybody knows that this field that

39
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,360
women role models

40
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,600
and how many intersex women champions

41
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,439
are there especially when we talk about

42
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:38,720
india handful of them there are so many

43
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:40,079
unconscious bias we

44
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:42,560
all have whether i'm inadequate to be

45
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:43,360
part of i.t

46
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:46,479
or infosec whether i'm good at it or not

47
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:48,159
we are hesitant in speaking with the

48
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:49,920
people who are not like us

49
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:53,040
we always look for safe space to speak

50
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,479
without feeling being judged we as women

51
00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:58,479
always want to be 10 or 10

52
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:00,719
be family meet workplace feed anywhere

53
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:01,600
else

54
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,600
everything should be well at home

55
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:04,880
husband to be best in

56
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:08,080
space child to be have the best of

57
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:10,800
life which leaves very less space for

58
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,640
our own aspirations

59
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:15,280
weekdays are hectic weekends are even

60
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,120
more hectic

61
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,200
especially to think about anything else

62
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,560
than family

63
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:23,280
now according to one of the surveys

64
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,239
women represent

65
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:27,040
only a quarter of the overall workforce

66
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,480
in cyber security

67
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:31,040
this is significantly a higher number

68
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,120
than 2017 which was just

69
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,959
11 but we still have a long way to go

70
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:39,920
i also felt all of that and that's what

71
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,680
motivated me to take up

72
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:44,400
a new a community which can help

73
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,200
bringing more women in cyber security

74
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:50,720

75
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,560

other initiatives

106
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:02,239
apart from that i regularly host speak

and a part of be part of multiple local

108
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:09,280
and international conferences

109
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:13,120
now i wanted to portray

110
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:16,320
infosec rules in one of the pictures now

111
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,959
when i try to search and when i try to

112
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:20,079
visualize

113
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:23,120
this one gif does the job brilliantly

114
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,600
than anything else it sums up and for

115
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,520
cigars really well

116
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:30,080
now what is infrastructure it's a

117
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,400
community which is always thriving

118
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,400
and working hard to support women and

119
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:37,120
students to be part of infosectors

120
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:41,199
and part of infosec now the core aim of

121
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:44,320
is to encourage them make sure they

122
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,880
don't leave the infrastructure space

123
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,800
we started infrastructures with the idea

124
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,960
of giving the safe space to women

125
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:54,960
but then we expanded it to the students

126
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:57,840
in a short span of four years we have

127
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:58,880
been able to

128
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:02,000
uh leverage our own community and bring

129
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:02,800
together

130
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:06,240
uh many people we have provided

131
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,840
one-to-one mentoring

132
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:10,960
to more than 200 women there have been

133
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:13,440
multiple career counseling sessions

134
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,759
which then resulted in more than 20

135
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:17,360
final job offers

136
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,600
we have built a thriving community of

137
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,639
speakers

138
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:22,800
more than a dozen out of them have gone

139
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,919
out and spoken at global conferences

140
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:29,039
infosec girls started in 2014

141
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:31,680
we had a downfall for some time but then

142
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,800
we rejuvenated back to community in

143
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,199
2017.

144
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:37,600
since then every year we are trying to

145
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:40,800
uh outgrow the number from the past year

146
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,720
we started the community with only

147
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,840
bangalore chapter

148
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:46,479
as there were multiple questions in mind

149
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:47,919
how many participants

150
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:51,039
and speakers would be coming and

151
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:54,240
with our regular jobs and family how are

152
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,400
we going to manage all of this

153
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:00,000
some of our some of us including myself

154
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
had more than a fair share of family

155
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,280
responsibilities

156
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,840
including infants so hence we started

157
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:08,400
the humble goals to begin with

158
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:11,600
and preferred slow and steady growth

159
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,240
wherein we're trying to achieve few

160
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,039
numbers

161
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:18,319
every year now we have over 15 chapter

162
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:19,680
leaders around the world

163
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:22,000
covering multiple cities in india we've

164
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,440
trained over 3000

165
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:27,039
women across the globe everything was

166
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:28,319
not a rosy picture

167
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:31,759
along the journey we did face our fair

168
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:32,400
share of

169
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:36,080
struggles we did had ours we did have

170
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:39,680
our own uh downfalls and issues

171
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:42,479
along the journey and when we talk about

172
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:43,759
building a community

173
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:46,080
or running a community the biggest

174
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,120
challenge is

175
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:51,440
that when it starts and where will it go

176
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:54,400
unlike an exam we study the courseware

177
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,039
and we know

178
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:58,000
whether we'll pass we will fail or we

179
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,520
will get the definition

180
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,919
but with the communities anything better

181
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:03,199
than yesterday

182
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:06,080
is good enough but how to keep that

183
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:08,240
going

184
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,479
now the first challenge was gathering

185
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:12,160
the people

186
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:15,280
sparking the initial interest making

187
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:16,240
sure that

188
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,880
we are trying together more people we

189
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:21,520
are trying to spread the awareness

190
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:24,720
so another big challenge was how they're

191
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,240
going to balance the family

192
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:29,599
how we are going to balance the families

193
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:33,120
especially to come to the mains and

194
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,599
when we talk about less number of women

195
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:36,800
in security so how

196
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,720
have how we can actually bring all of

197
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,960
them together

198
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,680
another big challenge was the venue how

199
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,599
are we going to find a space

200
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:47,919
to collaborate and come and meet with

201
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:49,599
each other

202
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:52,479
so when we started hosting meets uh

203
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:53,759
first time

204
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:56,639
we had a lot of concerns especially from

205
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:59,120
the venue providers like

206
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,199
there were a lot of trust concerns like

207
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:03,199
what this community is about

208
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:05,120
how it's going to cater to the goals

209
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,639
that they have

210
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:09,440
and especially there were a lot of

211
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:10,560
people

212
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:13,039
who asked the uh who asked for the money

213
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:14,319
from us

214
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:18,160
and we didn't have money another thing

215
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,000
came into picture wherein

216
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,479
how we will find a venue which is like

217
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:24,160
centrally located

218
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,319
and people can come there because

219
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:29,840
reaching a venue is one important thing

220
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:32,880
another big challenge was now we had

221
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,640
figured out okay this is how we're going

222
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:35,919
to gather the people

223
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:37,919
this is the venue that where we will be

224
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:39,200
hosting our meetup

225
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,599
but finding the speakers who can

226
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:44,159
actually have confidence in our own

227
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:47,680
goals and vision that we had so

228
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,600
there were so many people who had

229
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,760
preconceived notions

230
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:54,080
especially women like i would like to

231
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,519
mention the disparity

232
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:58,160
traces back into the school i've often

233
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:58,800
heard

234
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,839
that people preaching uh that women

235
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:04,160
are not meant for tech and especially

236
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,240
not for infosec

237
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:09,920
it has nothing to do with gender and

238
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:12,160
another big question was that people

239
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,160
didn't know about that there can be

240
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,880
a women community or actually women can

241
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,720
support each other

242
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:21,120
another most important factor was

243
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,880
apprehension

244
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:25,600
if we were rude or bullied for speaking

245
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,640
something which

246
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:29,360
which was not right and everyone has it

247
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,000
even i

248
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,800
did have it not just women men also have

249
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,720
the same thing

250
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:37,839
time management how will i be able to

251
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:38,880
manage the time

252
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:42,080
with the family we had very low

253
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,360
participation

254
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:46,240
due to the less outreach and less people

255
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,080
knowing about the cause

256
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,080
we did not realize that spreading

257
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,880
awareness was very important

258
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:55,120
we were not following multiple mediums

259
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:57,279
to reach the audience

260
00:09:57,279 --> 00:09:58,880
in the beginning it was difficult to

261
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,720
bring in like more than

262
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:03,279
three or four people we had like a bunch

263
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:05,200
of people coming into the means

264
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:08,320
but we never lost hope we never

265
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:13,120
uh stopped trying hard

266
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:16,240
now two of the founders started the infa

267
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,040
figures

268
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:20,959
they tried something did a few things

269
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:23,200
he had an idea but could not take it

270
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,880
forward due to the personal and

271
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,560
professional reasons

272
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:29,839
or commitments at some point

273
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:33,040
infrastructural stopped we rejuvenated

274
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:33,360
it

275
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:36,640
but after that we were worried how to

276
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:37,839
stop the same

277
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:40,720
uh happening the same again hence the

278
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,720
sustainability plane plan had to be

279
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:43,519
there

280
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:46,560
how to make it run for a longer period

281
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:51,120
and another point how to stay motivated

282
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:54,560
we did receive the acceptance after a

283
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:55,519
while

284
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:58,079
when people started showing interest in

285
00:10:58,079 --> 00:10:59,360
the community

286
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,760
they started reaching out to us they

287
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:02,480
started

288
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:05,760
uh asking that how i can be part of it

289
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:08,959
when your providers started trusting us

290
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:11,440
and supporting us like with sponsorships

291
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,079
and

292
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:14,640
telling that okay you can use my venue

293
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,399
now we do have four to five venues

294
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:18,160
available in most cities that we have

295
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,839
our employee girls

296
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:23,040
and we host meetups they were saying

297
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,120
keep doing the work good work don't wait

298
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,079
for the reward

299
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:28,320
things will automatically turn out to be

300
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,880
positive and that's what happened to us

301
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:34,160
and you can see in the uh on the screen

302
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:37,760
now we as part of the emphasis girls

303
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:40,959
do contribute in some other way and

304
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:42,720
the things that we do i would like to

305
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:45,360
share with you all

306
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:48,800
so what do we do we do host regular

307
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:49,839
meetups

308
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:53,839
and as part of the regular meetup we try

309
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:56,800
and meet and connect with each other to

310
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,880
share the technical knowledge

311
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:02,560
we also connect over uh informal lunches

312
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:06,079
so that we have a human touch we get to

313
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:07,120
know each other

314
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:10,560
and bond with each other we also

315
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:13,600
do meet over uh ideas and we

316
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,480
share ideas like i have some idea but

317
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,639
you might have a better idea

318
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:21,279
so we just talk about it how we can

319
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:22,079
actually

320
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:25,200
or bring in something new so that's all

321
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:28,639
or we do it at our meetups and

322
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:31,519
uh at discover time it's really not

323
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:33,440
possible to meet in person

324
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:38,160
so uh we felt the same way back in 2017

325
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:38,959
that

326
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:41,279
not all of us would be able to join

327
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:42,639
in-person meetups

328
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:44,959
so we started the virtual meets wherein

329
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:46,000
uh

330
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,040
we started our own youtube channel

331
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:52,160
and we started hosting all those

332
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:55,200
global meets wherein women around the

333
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,720
world can chime in and connect with the

334
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:57,600
indian women

335
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,680
so at every need there is one indian

336
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,440
women for sure

337
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:04,000
and out of those all the sessions that

338
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:04,720
we had

339
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,720
there are 80 percent of them are like

340
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:09,920
first-time speakers

341
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,920
we started collaborating with schools

342
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,120
universities

343
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:19,360
and many such places so

344
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:22,560
not much has been done in um

345
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,639
educating the students especially about

346
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:25,839
cyber security

347
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:28,800
we do have a lot of things going on okay

348
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:29,839
let's do this

349
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:31,680
let's do a hackathon let's develop

350
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,120
something but how about

351
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,519
imparting cyber security knowledge and i

352
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:36,160
believe

353
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:38,720
there has to be a separate program for

354
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,639
bringing up cyber security awareness

355
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:43,199
amongst the kids and students

356
00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:46,000
especially college students the pros and

357
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
cons of cyber security needs to be

358
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,040
assimilated deep down into the roots

359
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:53,600
right from the start from the school

360
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,600
this is how we can make a change

361
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:58,959
and make our nation's cyberspace

362
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:01,040
one more approach other than the

363
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,720
awareness program would be giving them

364
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:05,360
the exposure to unmediated scenarios

365
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:07,600
in the form of games or challenges this

366
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,199
will catch their attention

367
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:11,600
and make them brainstorm about the

368
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:14,240
importance of cyber security

369
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:16,079
we started bringing cyber security to

370
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:17,440
the college students

371
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,199
and giving them opportunities before

372
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:21,440
even moving out of the college

373
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:24,560
and hence entire team of employee girls

374
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:28,399
spanning across india and outside

375
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:31,279
is trying to bridge that gap we

376
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:32,959
collaborate with international

377
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:34,800
institutes

378
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:37,120
when we talk about cyber security it's

379
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,800
all about ideas

380
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:42,160
and idea rules the world

381
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:44,720
learning is a lifelong process the

382
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,079
earlier it starts

383
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:48,720
the better so how about providing

384
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,880
scholarships and sponsorships to the

385
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:51,920
students

386
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:54,320
and women as part of infosec girls we

387
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:56,720
provide scholarships to

388
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:59,680
for various forums and conferences we

389
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:00,639
collaborate

390
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:02,959
with many conferences and colleges to

391
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:04,000
make sure that

392
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,360
uh students and women go out and be part

393
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:08,800
of the bigger conferences bigger

394
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,959
community and experience

395
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:12,880
how the world looks like when we talk

396
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:14,480
about infrastructures

397
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:17,360
it's not just a cocoon come out of your

398
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,120
cocoon and talk with people

399
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:22,560
share your ideas so

400
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:25,600
now the gap has been identified

401
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,920
our mission is to bridge that gap and

402
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:28,639
educate

403
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:31,360
more and more women passionate towards

404
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:32,560
security

405
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:36,000
by providing them the training via meets

406
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,199
and workshops

407
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:38,959
so we started giving workshops and

408
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:40,800
trainings at different cities

409
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,600
colleges and other conferences we have

410
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,040
given many workshops

411
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:48,160
at global conferences as well so these

412
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,600
are some of the trainings that we have

413
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:50,000
given

414
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,680
around the world in india outside india

415
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:57,120
like us egypt or israel

416
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:02,079
uh south africa and many more countries

417
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:05,440
now the tech uh industry is actually

418
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,519
grappling with two bike challenges

419
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:10,800
first it's struggling to make sure that

420
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,399
we have the right set of people

421
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:14,639
in information security how we can have

422
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:16,399
diverse set of people

423
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:19,279
so we started giving our free training

424
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:19,920
at

425
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:23,120
the conferences and colleges

426
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:26,399
so today i want to share

427
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:28,320
what this training was all about so here

428
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,079
is the link for our web application

429
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:30,959
security

430
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:34,399
for the people to get started and

431
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:36,639
you can actually see there's a flow

432
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:39,199
step-by-step process to start off

433
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:41,040
what is web application security what is

434
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,959
a proxy um

435
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:46,320
what is an attack look like what is sql

436
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:46,959
injection

437
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:48,720
what is a class site scripting what is

438
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:51,519
an idol what is an xxc

439
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:54,000
so everything is documented step by step

440
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,440
how you can replicate it

441
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,279
you've used multiple vulnerable weather

442
00:16:57,279 --> 00:16:59,199
applications to train people

443
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:02,000
so we have outsourced everything here

444
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,440
you can take a look at it

445
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,119
and if you have any confusion you can

446
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:07,280
reach out to us anytime so this is the

447
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:08,959
link for our training which we wanted to

448
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:10,640
release

449
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:13,839
and um so today we are making our course

450
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:14,880
content public

451
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,959
to the wider community and world so that

452
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:18,079
they can go

453
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:20,799
get benefit from it and train other

454
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:21,599
people

455
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:23,199
especially for college students if you

456
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:24,720
want to kick-start your career in an

457
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,240
application theory

458
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:28,880
you can actually take a look at it we've

459
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,400
also helped

460
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,880
some of the organizations and colleges

461
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:35,360
to perform ctf capture the flags

462
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:38,160
so we've done partnership with them for

463
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:38,799
what

464
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:40,720
to encourage the diverse candidates

465
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,000
including students around

466
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,559
infosec these challenges really really

467
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:45,120
helped

468
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:49,760
and especially bring curiosity in them

469
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:54,480
when we talk about the infosec skill gap

470
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,400
people really talk about it especially

471
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,919
from past few years we've been talking

472
00:17:57,919 --> 00:17:58,320
about

473
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,720
there's a skill gap but how to address

474
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:01,600
that

475
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,840
that's the number one problem now

476
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,200
another problem is

477
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:08,320
how to fix that gap both of the problem

478
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,080
are even more acute

479
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:12,640
when it comes to cyber security there

480
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:14,559
are more than one million cyber security

481
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:15,200
jobs

482
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,600
that needs to be filled which is like

483
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,360
projected

484
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:23,360
and now when we have such a huge gap

485
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:25,280
to fill those one million cyber security

486
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:26,799
jobs the industry must

487
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:30,240
look at crosstalk people bring people

488
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:33,520
from diverse groups fresh ideas

489
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:36,559
so how do we actually bring them

490
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:39,440
to increase the number first step is

491
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:40,400
like

492
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,640
we have to approach the people who are

493
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:43,600
there

494
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:46,000
to make them active okay yes you can be

495
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,600
part of him for psycho

496
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:50,480
now once you have active people how

497
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:51,120
about

498
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:53,600
converting converting in inactive people

499
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,200
to the active people

500
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:58,160
branching out reaching out to the people

501
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:00,160
who don't know about infosec

502
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:03,919
i have trained myself like the qa

503
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:06,559
to bring them to security developers to

504
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:08,240
bring them to security

505
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:10,480
people who are part of system admins to

506
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,400
be part of network security

507
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,799
so it's like cross-training people

508
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:17,200
there's nothing more beautiful than that

509
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:20,960
now what better way to show you the

510
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:21,840
impact

511
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:24,240
from the ideas and thoughts of people

512
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:25,120
who have been

513
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:29,679
impacted by us so about jasmine

514
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:32,559
she started uh coming to imperfect girls

515
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:33,039
and

516
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:36,240
she felt that yes she can actually

517
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:39,360
overcome her stage fear she had a

518
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:42,480
huge stage fear but we helped her in dry

519
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:44,720

she is one of the director for for a

527
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:04,400
company but she did not feel that

528
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:07,520
there is an age gap irrespective of

529
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:09,679
any age group this community supports

530
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:10,799

00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:46,320
she felt formed

546
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,960

572
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:49,280

but during the time of covid we do the

578
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:01,120
meetups

579
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:03,120
every two weeks so that we can connect

580
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:05,919
with the global audience

581
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:08,880

we've also uh tried and connected

588
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:27,280
uh and tagging up with multiple colleges

589
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:29,600
across india and abroad to spread the

590
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:30,960
knowledge to restrain

591
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:33,600
students and we try and help the

592
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,280
colleges refine their curriculum

593
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:35,919
especially

594
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:39,280
when it comes to cyber security united

595
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:40,640
we stand

596
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:43,360
if i'm managing alone i will fail i

597
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:44,960
would never be able to perform

598
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:47,120
what i really want to do especially when

599
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:48,880
it comes to a community

600
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:51,760
so with unity as and when there have

601
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:52,080
been

602
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:55,360
any or mishappenings or any uh

603
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:58,159
criticization we always have been there

604
00:22:58,159 --> 00:22:59,280
for each other

605
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:01,600
we always have been there and stood for

606
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:02,960
each other

607
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:06,320
whenever any leader felt low

608
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:09,120
we always strive and talk to each other

609
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:09,840
whenever

610
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:12,640
uh we are trying to coordinate a session

611
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,640
we make sure we learn from the session

612
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:17,919
not just coordinate we all

613
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:20,400
work together and we all respect each

614
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,679
other

615
00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:23,760
whenever there's a leader who's stepping

616
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:26,240
down we respect them

617
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:29,039
we help them look for the future

618
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:30,720
endeavors whenever they want to come

619
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:31,200
back

620
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:34,559
the place is theirs now the recipe for a

621
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:36,480
strong community is their

622
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:39,600
passionate people leaders

623
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:42,799
and compassion we create grooming the

624
00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:43,840
new speakers

625
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:46,159
doing the dry runs with them before the

626
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:47,440
even talk happens

627
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:49,039
to help them gain confidence because

628
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:50,799
that's very very important

629
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:53,200
when i gave my first talk i couldn't

630
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,960
even look at the audience

631
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:58,240
i was dead nervous now

632
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:00,400
we try to make sure we bring the

633
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,400
confidence in them

634
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:05,440
now people who are hesitant in speaking

635
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:07,760
we help them in understanding okay this

636
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:09,840
is how the first time ever speaker is

637
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:11,840
doing this is how you can actually give

638
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:13,200
your presentation

639
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:16,559
so we help them in their talks

640
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:18,960
we keep experimenting we keep

641
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:21,840
experimenting with our own formats

642
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:25,120
like uh when we create banners or we

643
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:28,080
we find new speakers every time we keep

644
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:29,279
grooming them

645
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:32,159
and now we experiment with the new

646
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:33,919
avenues venues

647
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:37,679
like right now we are in the kobe times

648
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:39,279
we've been experimenting with different

649
00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:41,840
platforms that how to stream live

650
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:44,640
on a channel how to do the live

651
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:45,520
trainings

652
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:48,400
how to perform the meets how to connect

653
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,159
with a wider audience

654
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:53,679
now when we talk about infosec girls

655
00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:56,799
chapters we have over like as i said

656
00:24:56,799 --> 00:24:58,559
15 chapters and these are some of the

657
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:01,440
leaders around the globe that we have

658
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:05,679
without them infosec girls wouldn't have

659
00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:06,799
been possible

660
00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:09,120
and wouldn't have been existing or

661
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:11,840
sustaining

662
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:14,880
so what we really do with the community

663
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:17,440
we always ask for feedback

664
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:20,480
we ask them what we can do better

665
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:23,200
what can be important what all things

666
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,240
can be done

667
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:28,240
especially when we what new we can bring

668
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:30,559
now as for the feedback from the

669
00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:31,840
relevant uh

670
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:36,640
feedback we embed in our own journey

671
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:40,559
we all uh we all take a tab on

672
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:46,000
the feedback and keep enhancing on that

673
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:49,520
now we all have a question

674
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:52,400
when we talk about community should i

675
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,000
start a community of my own

676
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,320
or should i contribute to an existing

677
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:57,120
one

678
00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:00,480
now i have something to tell you or

679
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:01,760
you should ask these questions to

680
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:04,320
yourself why would you create a new

681
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:06,400
community

682
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:09,200
if there is no community around if there

683
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:11,360
is a community

684
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:13,360
then toss it matches your vision and

685
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:16,080
goal or what you want to do

686
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:19,440
test the goal of the community matches

687
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:22,799
the core values of myself if no

688
00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:24,960
then do we have the bandwidth to start a

689
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:27,039
new community

690
00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:29,600
however building a community is a giant

691
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:30,960
effort

692
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:33,919
so if you start a community ensure you

693
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:35,520
keep it running

694
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:38,400
now if the goal matches we can join the

695
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:39,760
community

696
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:42,559
so we started taking the steps in

697
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:45,360
building the community a few years ago

698
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:47,440
we had a lot of questions a lot of

699
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:49,120
challenges along the journey

700
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:51,760
which we tried to solve with this

701
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:53,039
particular framework

702
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:56,240
we're trying to help you with your

703
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:58,799
journey of infosec

704
00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:01,440
so the first thing is there are four

705
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:02,400
pillars

706
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:05,600
which make this framework building

707
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:09,279
managing improving and before that

708
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:13,039
sustenance now when we talk about

709
00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:14,720
building

710
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:16,320
naming the community is the most

711
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:18,159
important thing finding the right name

712
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:18,640
for it

713
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:21,360
which can match the goal and the vision

714
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:23,360
that you have in your mind

715
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:28,080
finding a venue plan the meetups

716
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:30,159
creating a mailing list creating the

717
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:32,399
social media handle so that

718
00:27:32,399 --> 00:27:34,559
you people get to know that you are

719
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:36,399
going to start a new community

720
00:27:36,399 --> 00:27:37,679
there's a community that they can

721
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:39,919
resonate to

722
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:42,880
announce the meetups partner with the

723
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:44,240
venue providers so that the

724
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:46,880
meetups can keep on going find

725
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:49,279
colleagues community is not a one-man

726
00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:49,679
show or

727
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:54,559
not women one women show it has to be

728
00:27:54,559 --> 00:27:57,440
with multiple leads so that it keeps on

729
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:59,200
running

730
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:01,279
planning the frequency of the meat is

731
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:02,720
very very important whether it's going

732
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:03,760
to happen

733
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:06,080
every month every two months every three

734
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:08,880
months what platform we would be using

735
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:11,120
announcing the meat on the website on

736
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:13,679
all the social media handles

737
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:16,399
now when you have on the social media

738
00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:17,919
handles

739
00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:20,880
you should have a code of conduct that

740
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:22,559
yes this is how we all are going to

741
00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:23,200
behave

742
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:26,399
when we talk about the meetups we

743
00:28:26,399 --> 00:28:28,559
are going to have meetups every now and

744
00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:31,600
then but how about sustaining it

745
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:34,880
we had our downfall but we came up with

746
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,000
a plan so that

747
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,080
we can actually keep the community

748
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:40,399
running so we have to discuss with all

749
00:28:40,399 --> 00:28:41,840
the leads that how should we keep it

750
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:43,440
running for longer time

751
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:45,440
we can have shorter goals okay let's

752
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:46,960
keep it running for one year

753
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:49,120
let's keep it running for two years now

754
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:50,880
now what new we can bring in the

755
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:52,640
community

756
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:54,880
then how we can improve on the feedback

757
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:56,000
from the community

758
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,559
that's what keep the interest of the

759
00:28:58,559 --> 00:28:59,600
people

760
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:02,080
yes the community is actually my

761
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:03,039
community

762
00:29:03,039 --> 00:29:04,480
people are listening the leads are

763
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:07,039
listening and i can be a lead one day

764
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:09,360
it's very very important to take the

765
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:12,320
feedback and work on that these are some

766
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:13,679
of the ethos

767
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:16,240
uh that we have built for our own

768
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:17,360
community

769
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:19,760
and which can resonate with any of the

770
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:21,039
communities

771
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:22,799
we should always give back to the

772
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:25,039
community in some form or the other

773
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:26,799
like we have learned from the community

774
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:28,559
now let's give it back

775
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:31,840
now community is inclusive of everyone

776
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:34,880
right from a common college student to

777
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:38,960
a old age person it can include anyone

778
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:41,440
there's no age for learning something

779
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:42,799
new

780
00:29:42,799 --> 00:29:45,679
the enthusiasm of the community members

781
00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:48,799
we have to keep it running

782
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:52,720
we have uh we have created a future

783
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:54,159
roadmap for us

784
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:57,360
a goal for us a vision for us so that

785
00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:00,480
we don't have a downfall again or we

786
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:01,520
don't see

787
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:04,880
the downfall again so uh we have a plan

788
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:06,399
for the next ten years okay

789
00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:09,840
let's keep these many chapter leaders

790
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:12,960
going we have 15 capital leaders how

791
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:14,000
about reaching

792
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,480
every part of the country especially

793
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:17,840
stats from india

794
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:21,120
and every part of the globe there are

795
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:23,520
uh so many unsung areas where people

796
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:25,120
don't think of going

797
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:28,399
how about reaching those areas host free

798
00:30:28,399 --> 00:30:30,480
conferences for the community to learn

799
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:33,440
and share knowledge encourage more and

800
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:35,520
more participants

801
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:38,640
and let them speak at the

802
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:41,279
conference at the means give them a

803
00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:43,120
space to speak

804
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:45,520
focus on educating underprivileged

805
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:47,840
people

806
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:50,799
there are some key takeaways now we've

807
00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:51,360
heard

808
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:53,360
all the things that infosect girls have

809
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:55,600
been doing or what we should be doing

810
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:58,799
how about we pay it forward showcase

811
00:30:58,799 --> 00:31:01,679
the positive differentiation by making

812
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:02,799
security

813
00:31:02,799 --> 00:31:06,080
much more secure and if not

814
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:07,600
let's take help from different

815
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:09,360
organizations how about

816
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:12,880
partnering with them we are making good

817
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:13,600
progress

818
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:16,799
but we do have a long way to go there is

819
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:18,960
a lot of work that needs to go

820
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:23,360
in there is a mantra

821
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:26,880
that we that we consider

822
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:30,640

to identify why women are not pursuing

856
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:20,799
infosec

857
00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:23,279
so i would like to say yes there are a

858
00:33:23,279 --> 00:33:25,279
lot of challenges first of all

859
00:33:25,279 --> 00:33:27,600
a lot of women are not aware that this

860
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:28,720
is the field wherein

861
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:32,000
they can experiment uh so

862
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,360
that's what we are trying to do we are

863
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:35,120
trying to make them aware about that

864
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:37,200
there is a field that exists

865
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:41,120
uh and we need to take a step forward

866
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:43,279
and be part of this industry because

867
00:33:43,279 --> 00:33:45,200
this industry need

868
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:48,559
creative mindset which we have

869
00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:50,720
and people are so supportive in their

870
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:52,080
this industry that

871
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:54,320
if you want to come forward and be part

872
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:55,519
of infosec

873
00:33:55,519 --> 00:33:58,880
everyone supports there's no gender bias

874
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:00,799
there are few things which we hear but

875
00:34:00,799 --> 00:34:03,360
then uh the community that i have been

876
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:03,760
with

877
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:08,239
they're all supportive and

878
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:11,599
we all need to work towards bringing

879
00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:14,159
people from college and telling them

880
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:15,040
that yes

881
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:16,879
you can be part of information security

882
00:34:16,879 --> 00:34:18,960
there is a domain that exists

883
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:23,040
there are colleges who are who have

884
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:25,918
courses on information security but then

885
00:34:25,918 --> 00:34:28,000
we still have a long way to go

886
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,760
so that we can have more and more

887
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:31,280
diverse candidates

888
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:35,839
in information security

889
00:34:47,839 --> 00:34:50,159
so um now while we are getting more

890
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:52,399
questions i would like to say that

891
00:34:52,399 --> 00:34:54,719
if uh you want to know more about the

892
00:34:54,719 --> 00:34:56,560
framework which i have shared i would

893
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:58,320
love to discuss about it

894
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:01,040
um and especially i would say or please

895
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:03,119
look at the training that we released

896
00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:05,440
because uh if you are getting into

897
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:07,200
application security

898
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:09,520
that is a good training to get kick

899
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:10,480
start your uh

900
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:12,160
career in application security and i

901
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:14,480
have a few other resources which can

902
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:15,599
help you

903
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:17,599
getting started in application security

904
00:35:17,599 --> 00:35:21,040
there are a few resources i have for

905
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:24,160
docker container security so i can share

906
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:30,960
it with you

907
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:33,839
and uh even though we do have leaders in

908
00:35:33,839 --> 00:35:36,000
india and few other part of the world

909
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,400
uh few other parts of the world but we

910
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:40,480
still have less hands

911
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:43,920
so we would love to get we would love to

912
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:45,520
get you on board

913
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:49,040
take your feedback and if you want to

914
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:51,440
volunteer you want to be part of it

915
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:53,920
it's everyone's community even though we

916
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:54,560
started in

917
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:59,200
india but we wanted to go global

918
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:02,000
we want people to know okay uh there are

919
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,760
some resources which are available which

920
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:04,960
we can leverage

921
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:06,880
and it's not that that we are not

922
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:08,560
joining hands with other communities

923
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:11,440
it's always good to have collaboration

924
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:13,040
with other communities as i mentioned

925
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:13,520
that

926
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:15,359
it's always good to have multiple hands

927
00:36:15,359 --> 00:36:18,960
multiple eyes supporting each other

928
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:27,040
absolutely we are anticipating um and we

929
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:28,640
are releasing more trainings in the

930
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:29,920
coming up sessions

931
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:32,320
so that people can take help from it uh

932
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:33,920
if you want to have virtual machines

933
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:35,200

934
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:38,160

972
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:23,520
