hey everyone

3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,560
my name is ron and i'm a principal

4
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:23,039
research manager in the cyber security

5
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:25,199
research center at ben gurion university

6
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:26,480
of the negev

7
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:29,760
my research group focus on utilizing ai

8
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:30,000
for

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,360
cyber security purposes my talk today

10
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:35,920
is based on our recent activity in the

11
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:37,680
domain of human factors

12
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:41,280
and cyber security social engineering

13
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:42,079
attacks

14
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:44,320
have changed in recent years

15
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:46,559
specifically social engineering attacks

16
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:50,000
goes way beyond phishing examples for

17
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,360
other attack vectors

18
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,039
that exploit the human factor

19
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:55,840
vulnerability are password cracking

20
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:58,079
derived by download attack permission

21
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:02,320
abuse and certificate manipulation

22
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:04,720
in addition social engineering attacks

23
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:07,439
are no longer limited to pieces

24
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:09,439
in recent years we have noticed said

25
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:11,280
that common social engineering attack

26
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,000
vectors

27
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,560
have variants to smartphones in social

28
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:15,439
media

29
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:17,600
for instance by exploiting the android

30
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,360
permission mechanism to acquire

31
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:20,960
sensitive permission

32
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:23,520
or by exploiting facebook posts and

33
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:27,840
messages to initiate phishing attacks

34
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:30,159
after analyzing multiple social

35
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:32,079
engineering attack case studies

36
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:34,159
and their implementation on different

37
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:35,119
platforms

38
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:38,640
we had one main conclusion the skills

39
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:39,360
needed

40
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,840
by a user to mitigate different type of

41
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:42,720
attacks

42
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,920
are not necessarily the same in other

43
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:46,799
words

44
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:49,920
it is quite possible that a user

45
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,720
will own the skill required to mitigate

46
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,320
one type of attack

47
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:56,880
and at the same time missing the skills

48
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:59,680
required to mitigate another attack

49
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:03,119
as a result we believe that the security

50
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:04,560
awareness of user

51
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:07,280
cannot be measured accurately using a

52
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,758
unified measure that do not distinguish

53
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:13,280
between different attack vectors

54
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:16,480
despite those changes most existing

55
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:17,280
solutions

56
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,200
do not distinguish between different

57
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:23,360
type of attacks and platforms

58
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:26,480
existing solutions can be classified

59
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:30,560
into two classes evaluation tools

60
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:34,480
and mitigation tools evaluation tools

61
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:37,040
are methods that can be used to identify

62
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:39,120
the vulnerable users

63
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:42,160
this mess these methods include

64
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,400
self-reported measures such as

65
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,440
interviews

66
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:48,840
surveys and questionnaires and attack

67
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:51,680
simulations

68
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:54,400
mitigation tools are methods that can be

69
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,200
used

70
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,840
for increasing the security awareness of

71
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:58,879
users

72
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:01,360
such as training workshop or method that

73
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,519
can be used to reduce the attack surface

74
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:05,599
by preventing the exploitation

75
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:07,920
of the human factor vulnerability such

76
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,159
as email protection tools or browser

77
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:12,239
isolation

78
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:16,840
however existing solutions has several

79
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:19,840
limitations

80
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:23,360
for instance questionnaires

81
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,680
and surveys are based on the

82
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:29,120
self-reported behavior of the user

83
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,040
and require the subject active

84
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:34,159
involvement and collaboration

85
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:37,840
these methods tend to be very subjective

86
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,640
biased and consuming significant human

87
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,640
resources

88
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:45,680
therefore they are less scalable and

89
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:49,440
cannot be performed continuously

90
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:53,680
attack simulation measure the momentary

91
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,760
behavior of subjects during specific

92
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,040
events

93
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:00,959
and they are mostly limited to fishing

94
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:03,840
these methods are very sensitive to

95
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,959
environmental and contextual factors

96
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:10,799
and therefore can be very biased

97
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:13,360
in addition they cannot be used to

98
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,120
evaluate the information security

99
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:18,160
awareness of users continuously

100
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,560
besides that since most of the

101
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,600
simulations

102
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,919
are based on phishing attacks they

103
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:26,160
cannot be used to evaluate the security

104
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,320
awareness of user to other attack

105
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,800
vectors

106
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,160
security awareness training workshops

107
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,880
are usually performed using videos

108
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:39,280
games and posters in a controlled

109
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:42,320
training environment

110
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:45,600
the problem with training workshops is

111
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,520
that the behavior of users in the

112
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,840
workshops does not necessarily reflect

113
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,199
the behavior of user

114
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:54,639
in his natural environment in addition

115
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:57,040
the fact that the employer forced the

116
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,960
employees to participate in the

117
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:01,280
in the workshop caused lower user

118
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,400
engagement

119
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:06,320
to the training process in addition

120
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,400
the fact that the employer forced the

121
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,880
employee to participate in the workshop

122
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,800
cause low user engagement to the

123
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,680
training process

124
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,039
methods that are used to reduce the

125
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:20,639
attack surface such as

126
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:23,360
email protection and browser isolation

127
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,080
can prevent

128
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:26,960
a specific exploitation technique

129
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,240
however

130
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:31,919
they leave the vulnerability unpatched

131
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:35,120
in addition these methods are mostly

132
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:35,919
limited

133
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:39,520
to specific such as the usual working

134
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,840
environment

135
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:44,160
when leaving the vulnerability and patch

136
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,280
the attacker

137
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:47,280
can exploit the vulnerability using

138
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,520
other exploitation techniques

139
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:50,960
which are not covered by the

140
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:53,840
counter-measure in addition

141
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:56,400
most counter-measure cannot be used to

142
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,680
protect the user

143
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:00,160
in other environments such as when

144
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:03,280
working from home

145
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,960
in order to address those limitations we

146
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:07,600
develop

147
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,800
safe mind safe mind

148
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,280
is an automated framework for

149
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,400
continuously

150
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,639
and objectively evaluating the

151
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:17,600
resilience of

152
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,000
users to specific type of social

153
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,960
engineering attacks

154
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:26,479
at the early beginning of the research

155
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:27,520
we defined

156
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:30,560
three critical success factors

157
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:33,520
the first one is understanding what to

158
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,360
measure

159
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:38,240
concretely what are the criteria for a

160
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,080
security aware user

161
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,000
and what are the importance of different

162
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,560
criteria in mitigating different type of

163
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,400
attacks

164
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:49,199
the second critical success factor is

165
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:50,080
understanding

166
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:54,160
how to evaluate those criteria

167
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,479
and the final success factor is

168
00:06:56,479 --> 00:06:58,240
understanding how to make

169
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:02,160
a behavioral change that will last long

170
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:05,919
in this talk i will focus on the first

171
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:09,680
two critical success factors

172
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:14,080
in order to define the criteria for a

173
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:16,479
security aware user

174
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:18,880
we systematically explored social

175
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:19,919
engineering attack

176
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:22,319
case studies and identified the

177
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:23,680
technologies

178
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:27,360
that are compromised by the attacker

179
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:30,479
next we enumerated security counter

180
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:31,440
measures

181
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,280
that can be used to protect these

182
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:34,720
technologies

183
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,680
and identify human factor

184
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:38,000
vulnerabilities

185
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,199
that are exploited by the attacker

186
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:44,000
based on these vulnerabilities we

187
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,080
formulated the criteria

188
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,479
required from a user to mitigate the

189
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:50,800
attack

190
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:57,360
the outcome of this procedure

191
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:00,560
is more than 30 criteria for a security

192
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:03,360
aware user

193
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:08,960
after formulating the criteria there is

194
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,000
a need

195
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,879
to estimate the importance of different

196
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:14,240
criteria

197
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,479
in mitigating different type of social

198
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:19,440
engineering attacks

199
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:22,960
in order to tackle this problem we

200
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:23,759
develop an

201
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:27,039
expert-based procedure for ranking

202
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:29,840
the criteria with respect to the

203
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:32,080
different attacks

204
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:35,279
the procedure was based on a well-known

205
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:36,159
technique

206
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:40,159
called ahp which allowed us

207
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:42,719
to reduce the ranking time to few

208
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:43,599
minutes

209
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:46,800
instead of few hours

210
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:51,519
we let 17 security experts to rank the

211
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:52,560
criteria

212
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:56,080
using our methods here you can see

213
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,519
definite models

214
00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:00,399
created to four different attacks

215
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:02,360
password-based attacks

216
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:04,959
application-based attacks phishing

217
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:05,920
attacks

218
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:09,120
and many-in-the-middle attacks as

219
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:12,480
can be naughty said the models are quite

220
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,000
different

221
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,519
and the importance of criteria

222
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:20,839
is distributed differently across those

223
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:23,839
models

224
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:27,600
here you can see the different models

225
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,080
created for many in the middle attacks

226
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:33,279
and phishing attacks with respect to the

227
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:35,440
browser technologies

228
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:38,560
as you can see for the phishing attack

229
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:41,760
the dominate criteria where it does not

230
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:45,920
send sensitive information via http

231
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:48,880
and does not insert private information

232
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:49,200
on

233
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:53,760
unvalidated websites in contrast

234
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,560
for the men in the middle attacks the

235
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,240
dominate criteria

236
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:01,519
were different for instance delete

237
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:04,160
unknown certificate from the device and

238
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,440
does not approve

239
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:08,640
unknown certificates

240
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:13,519
after understanding what to measure

241
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:16,240
we can now focus on the second critical

242
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,839
success factor

243
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:19,760
understanding how to measure those

244
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,600
criteria continuously

245
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,560
and objectively

246
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,959
we developed three complementary

247
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:28,240
solutions

248
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:31,279
an endpoint solution a network-based

249
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:32,399
solution

250
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:36,160
and the tax simulation framework

251
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:40,640
the endpoint solution include agents

252
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:44,399
for smartphones and pc they collect

253
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:48,320
multiple sensors data from the device

254
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:51,279
including the install application their

255
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:52,480
permissions

256
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:56,800
source and rating mail activity

257
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:00,720
security settings password management

258
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:04,480
social network activity and many more

259
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:08,640
using these sensors we created a profile

260
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:11,839
of the user with respect

261
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:15,839
to the different criteria

262
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:19,440
the endpoint solutions can derive a very

263
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:23,680
accurate profile of the user however

264
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:26,880
there are slightly intrusive

265
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:30,640
and require prior installation

266
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:33,519
we want to take the assessment one step

267
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:34,800
further

268
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,880
and derive a profile of the user

269
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:39,360
passively

270
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:42,800
to do so we develop network-based

271
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,320
solution

272
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,320
which derive a profile of the user

273
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:50,800
solely by analyzing his network traffic

274
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:53,760
in order to evaluate the criteria we

275
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:54,560
utilize

276
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:57,320
common techniques such as domain

277
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:59,040
categorization

278
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:02,560
the packet inspection and the assessment

279
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:06,319
of application level protocols

280
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,680
in addition we develop an attack

281
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:11,920
simulation framework

282
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:15,360
within this framework we implemented 20

283
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,160
variants

284
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:20,000
of attacks including permission abuse

285
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,279
for mobile and pc

286
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:26,800
certificate alerts word macros

287
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:30,399
and malicious pdf documents and phishing

288
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:33,760
through email sms and even facebook

289
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:36,160
posts

290
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:39,760
here is a short demo of the attack

291
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:42,800
simulation framework

292
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:46,079
on the left side we can see the operator

293
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:48,800
dashboard that can be used to configure

294
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,720
the attack

295
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:53,440
on the right side we can see the

296
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:56,800
employee's smartphone

297
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:01,120
which receives a notification

298
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:03,519
claiming that your facebook session was

299
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:04,959
expired

300
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:07,920
when the user press on the notification

301
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,519
the phishing webpage

302
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:12,399
is presented

303
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,920
for the evaluation we conducted an

304
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:16,959
experiment

305
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:20,079
involving 160 participants

306
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:22,000
that installed the framework for a

307
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,880
duration of seven weeks

308
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,959
we simulated four different attacks on

309
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:29,040
the we on the users

310
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:32,160
phishing spam permission abuse

311
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:35,600
and certificate manipulation

312
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,600
in addition to the endpoint the network

313
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:38,800
solutions

314
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,480
we use the traditional security

315
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:44,160
questionnaires for baseline

316
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:48,240
in figure 1 the upper figure

317
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:50,959
we classify the subject into three

318
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:53,440
security awareness level

319
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:57,120
low medium and high

320
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,839
this classification was based on the

321
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:00,880
score

322
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:04,800
derived by the framework then

323
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:07,279
we calculated the success rate in

324
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:09,600
mitigating the attack simulation

325
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,959
for each security awareness level

326
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:16,800
the results show that users

327
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:20,079
classified as with high awareness using

328
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:20,959
the endpoint

329
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:23,680
and network based solution which

330
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:24,800
described

331
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:28,240
by the purple and blue bars were more

332
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:30,720
likely to mitigate the attack

333
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:33,600
in compared to users classified as with

334
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,760
low awareness

335
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:38,800
in figure 2 below we

336
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:42,959
analyze the score in higher resolution

337
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:46,399
using moving average as can be naughty

338
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:47,360
said

339
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:50,079
the success rate of users in mitigating

340
00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:51,120
the attack

341
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:54,560
is very correlative to the score derived

342
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:55,680
using the endpoint

343
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:58,800
network based solutions

344
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:02,000
in other words users

345
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,839
with i-score were more likely to

346
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:07,839
mitigate the attack

347
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:11,680
and users with low score was more likely

348
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:12,000
to

349
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,720
fail in the attack on the other end

350
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:20,000
the classification made

351
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,720
based on the security questionnaire

352
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,399
which described by the

353
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:27,680
red bar was not correlative to the

354
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:28,720
success rate

355
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:32,320
in mitigating that attack

356
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,759
the main conclusions from the evaluation

357
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:39,839
are that self-reported behavior of

358
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:41,560
subjects may differ

359
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:46,399
significantly from their actual behavior

360
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:50,240
in contrast security awareness scores

361
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:53,600
derived from objective measures such as

362
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:54,000
data

363
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,079
collected by endpoint and network-based

364
00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:57,440
solution

365
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:00,320
are highly correlated with the user's

366
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:01,279
success

367
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:05,360
in mitigating social engineering attacks

368
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:09,839
thank you very much

369
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:15,360
everyone thank you for participating

370
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:19,120
virtually in my talk today and

371
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:21,839
i would like to refer several questions

372
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:23,120
that raised by the

373
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:26,160
attendance so

374
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:30,000
the first question asked by fernando

375
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,800
was how do you balance the holistic

376
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,240
aspect of attacks

377
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:37,040
with the privacy need of individuals

378
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,320
beyond their role

379
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:41,839
as employees so i will

380
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:44,880
distinguish between uh the two

381
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:47,759
different cases of the study or or the

382
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:49,040
the two different

383
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:51,519
scenarios in the study in the first

384
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:52,720
scenario

385
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:55,600
we collect all the information all the

386
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:56,720
raw data

387
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,480
in order to conduct the research in

388
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:00,079
order to understand

389
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:03,600
uh what are the criteria that we need

390
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:07,839
to make to analyze and to

391
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:10,959
be included in the score uh that will

392
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:13,439
later reflect the security awareness

393
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:15,119
their ability to

394
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:17,760
mitigate the different type of attacks

395
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:19,520
the reason for collecting all the raw

396
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:20,559
data is because we

397
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:23,599
we cannot know in advance uh

398
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:26,480
what are the exact measures and how to

399
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:27,599
uh

400
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:29,919
analyze all the data and how to create

401
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:30,720
the features

402
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,640
that can be later be used to calculate

403
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,559
this code however

404
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:37,840
a in the system that will

405
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:41,360
eventually run on the employee a

406
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:44,840
phone or pc we can only

407
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:47,840
a use in

408
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:50,960
aggregated data or use the extract

409
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:53,679
the feature the features on the device

410
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:54,480
and send

411
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:58,240
only aggregated data to the

412
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:00,799
employer system in order to create the

413
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:01,760
assessment

414
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:03,679
and is in this way we can create a

415
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:05,360
profile of the user

416
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:08,000
without revealing private other private

417
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,799
attribute of the user

418
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:13,840
a second question asked by fernando was

419
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:14,320
about

420
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:17,600
the demographics of the participant in

421
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:18,640
the study

422
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:23,039
so in this study we use a ungraduated

423
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:25,840
and graduated students from two

424
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:29,039
universities in israel uh

425
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:32,559
they was at the age between

426
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:35,679
a 20 to 35

427
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:38,320
and they have a different uh they are

428
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:39,280
they were comforted

429
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:42,000
from a different faculties so they have

430
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,120
a

431
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:47,520
different knowledge about security

432
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:49,679
if you want to get into the details of

433
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:51,600
all the demographic

434
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,520
attributes of the of the user that they

435
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,280
participate in this research you can

436
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:56,160
refer to the

437
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:58,480
the paper that we publish and you have

438
00:18:58,480 --> 00:18:59,840
all the

439
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:02,320
information about the demographic and we

440
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:03,840
also analyze the

441
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,760
impact of different demographic

442
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:08,880
attributes on the

443
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:12,160
security awareness of users okay this is

444
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:12,720
the two

445
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,559
questions that were asked during the

446
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:16,160
session and let me see

447
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:18,960
if i missed anything from the start of

448
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,559
the talk so

449
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:24,400
uh okay we appreciate

450
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:27,840
any peer review paper so as i said

451
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:31,200
before we publish two academic papers

452
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:34,240
one uh present all the

453
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:37,840
a theoretical background and theoretical

454
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:40,720
theoretical aspects of calculating the

455
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:41,760
score

456
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:44,000
especially how to calculate different

457
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,280
scores

458
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:48,320
for a different type of attacks and how

459
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:49,360
to

460
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:51,679
enumerate all the criteria for a

461
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:53,440
security aware user

462
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:56,880
and the second paypal

463
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:01,360
that recently published on kai

464
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:04,080
is talk about the measurements and the

465
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:05,760
experiment so

466
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:09,039
i will put into the chat links for

467
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:12,320
both of these papers so you can get into

468
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:14,080
all the details of this

469
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:17,440
research and we also have a patent

470
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:18,320
approved

471
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:21,440
that describe all the framework and the

472
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:23,440
idea of continuously

473
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:26,799
uh analyzing user behavior

474
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:30,159
in order to measure its robustness to

475
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:33,120
social engineering attacks let's see if

476
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:34,080
there is any

477
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:36,879
other question

478
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:40,799
thank you for all the participants

479
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:43,520
that enjoyed the session it's really

480
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:45,039
really nice to hear that

481
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:48,320
and so i see that there isn't any

482
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:51,039
other question that uh asked by the

483
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:52,240
audience

484
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:56,240
so uh i think we can end for now

485
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:59,039
and thank you very much all of you for

486
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:01,280
participating in this session

487
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:03,840
goodbye
