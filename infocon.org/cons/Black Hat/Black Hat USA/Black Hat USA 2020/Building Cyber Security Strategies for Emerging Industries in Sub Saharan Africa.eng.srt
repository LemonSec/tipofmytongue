2
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:17,279
hello blackheart community

3
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:19,119
thank you for giving us an opportunity

4
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:21,680
to speak at blackheart usa 2020.

5
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:23,840
today we'll be tackling the topic of

6
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:25,840
building cybersecurity strategies for

7
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:27,840
emerging industries in sub-saharan

8
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:29,119
africa

9
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:31,359
i'm laura teach and i'll be speaking

10
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:33,200
alongside evelyn killel

11
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,600
we are the co-founders of she hacks ke

12
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:37,680
which is a community of women in cyber

13
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:39,200
security in kenya

14
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,520
we have different programs for our women

15
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,360
where we bring together learners and

16
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:44,960
experts to share their knowledge and

17
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:46,640
experiences through

18
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:51,039
webinars bootcamps or mentorship

19
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:59,120
so why this talk towards the end of last

20
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:00,800
year and the beginning of this year we

21
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,960
were trying to come up with a curriculum

22
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:03,359
for the

23
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:05,760
for our community members uh we wanted

24
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:06,799
something that could

25
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:09,600
fit the needs of the industry so we went

26
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:10,159
uh

27
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:12,880
looking for data um to give us

28
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:14,720
information about how the security

29
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:16,640
landscape in sub-saharan looks like

30
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:19,680
africa looks like and in that process we

31
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,680
found it difficult to get data that

32
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:25,280
were specific to sub-saharan africa

33
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,680
we started asking ourselves the question

34
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:30,240
if we do not have data about sub-saharan

35
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:30,880
africa

36
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,640
how then can we come up with proper

37
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,799
strategies for the cyber security

38
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:36,320
industry

39
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:38,560
the other reason we submitted this talk

40
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,479
is to create awareness on the cyber

41
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:42,799
security industry and communities across

42
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:44,320
sub-saharan africa

43
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:46,240
we wanted people to know that there is

44
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:49,200
an existing cyber security industry here

45
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,840
and as much as it needs better or more

46
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:52,799
expansion

47
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:55,840
we still exist and we need to work

48
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,360
together to come together with the

49
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,640
different stakeholders

50
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:01,119
to make the industry better and the

51
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:02,640
third reason is to encourage

52
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,200
professionals in sub-saharan africa

53
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,680
professionals and enthusiasts so we

54
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,679
wanted people to see that there's

55
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:12,000
an existing community and the industry

56
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,520
needs more professionals

57
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,680
so we want to encourage more people to

58
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,640
try uh

59
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:19,360
join the industry to join communities in

60
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,760
cyber security in sub-saharan africa

61
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,760
and to work together to build this

62
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:24,420
industry

63
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:26,720
[Applause]

64
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:29,599
so where do we start we came up with

65
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:31,840
four questions that could help us

66
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:34,640
come up with a curriculum so we the four

67
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:35,680
questions would

68
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:38,560
all together work to come up with a

69
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,200
proper

70
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,519
solution for the industry in terms of

71
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:43,280
building the curriculum and building the

72
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,319
strategies

73
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:46,480
the questions are the first one was what

74
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:48,640
are some of the most used technologies

75
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:51,440
now this would give us an idea of what

76
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:52,239
the

77
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:53,840
technology landscape looks like in

78
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,000
sub-saharan africa what are the most

79
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,159
used technologies so that we get to

80
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:00,159
understand what threats come with these

81
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:01,440
technologies

82
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,280
the second question what does the threat

83
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,480
landscape look like

84
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,560
now after figuring out what the

85
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:09,120
technologies are that we use the most

86
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,200
then we get to find out what the threat

87
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,760
landscape in the region looks like

88
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:16,159
the third one was what are some of the

89
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:17,200
effects of

90
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,760
cyber threats now this is not just to

91
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,360
the economy but to the different

92
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,040
stakeholders the governments

93
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,519
the companies and even to individuals we

94
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:27,360
wanted to figure out what are some of

95
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,080
the effects

96
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,799
or what effects have cyber crime

97
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:32,319
activities have

98
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:35,360
had in in sub-saharan africa region and

99
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,360
the fourth and final one is what has

100
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,720
worked in the past

101
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,879
because we do not want to come up with

102
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:42,640
uh strategies from scratch

103
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,879
we are going to repurpose the ones that

104
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:47,120
the activities that have worked in the

105
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:47,599
past

106
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:49,280
or the solutions that have worked in the

107
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:51,360
past so we are going to discuss

108
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,920
all these four questions in detail as we

109
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,760
go by

110
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:58,159
i now welcome eve to take us to the

111
00:03:58,159 --> 00:03:58,879
threat

112
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:01,200
landscape in sub-saharan africa thank

113
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,560
you

114
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,480
thank you laura for kick-starting the

115
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,680
presentation

116
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:08,480
my name is evelyn killel once more and

117
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,319
i'll be taking you

118
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:11,840
through the cyber threat landscape in

119
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:14,080
sahara sub-saharan africa

120
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:17,279
so before that i'll take you through the

121
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:19,440
prediction of the i the prediction of

122
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:22,240
growth in the ict market in the region

123
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:26,080
so um the total sub-saharan ict market

124
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,440
is predicted to grow

125
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:30,560
from 95.4 billion

126
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:34,320
in 2020 to 104.2 billion

127
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:38,040
by 2023 so and this is due to the rapid

128
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,759
digitization

129
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:45,520
and falling costs of the ictf of the ict

130
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:49,199
ict market so the key areas of growth in

131
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:51,120
the region is mobile

132
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,120
the key areas of good in the region is

133
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,479
mobile money

134
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:57,199
why has it penetrated the sub-saharan

135
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:58,400
africa is

136
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:01,440
because of the unbanked population

137
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,840
in the region that have that are that

138
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,479
are able to access the

139
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:09,039
the different finances through mobile

140
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:10,639
money platforms

141
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:14,320
so as the key example of mobile

142
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,080
money penetration in the region is

143
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:19,039
impressa which is the leading in kenya

144
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:22,880
and it has more than above 30 million

145
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:26,160
consumers in the region

146
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,639
additionally there are new other

147
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:30,400
technologies that are being adapted

148
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,560
in the region one of them is cloud

149
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,680
technology

150
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:36,960
which is highly adopted by their small

151
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:40,400
medium enterprises why cloud technology

152
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,400
for these small medium enterprises

153
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:45,759
this is because of the ease ease of use

154
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:46,160
for

155
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:49,360
of the cloud platform that we have

156
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,440
so uh also to that the new other

157
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,639
technologies

158
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:55,360
one of them is blockchain and big data

159
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,639
these new technologies

160
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:58,240
introduce new threats and

161
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:00,000
vulnerabilities which

162
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,520
uh ensure a uh ensures that uh

163
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,520
which is an indicator that we need to

164
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:10,400
build a better and robust cyber security

165
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:13,520
frameworks to support in the in the new

166
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,440
vulnerabilities that are introduced by

167
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,000
the

168
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,160
new technologies that these markets

169
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,199
consume

170
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:21,520
so additionally to that most

171
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:22,639
organizations

172
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:25,759
have not really considered the the

173
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:29,600
cyber security the cyber security

174
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:32,800
impact cyber security impact in

175
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,680
in the region that means this need to to

176
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:36,319
have more

177
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:38,800
investments for cyber security in the

178
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:39,680
region

179
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:42,800
with regards to that i introduce uh

180
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,840
i let laura to take over the common

181
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,240
threats in sub-saharan africa

182
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,160
so eve has taken us through what the

183
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,599
threat landscape looks like in

184
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:53,039
sub-saharan africa

185
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:54,479
now we're going to talk about the

186
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:57,520
threats that are common in the region

187
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:00,319
an organization called syriano came up

188
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:00,720
with

189
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:03,440
data that that showed that the most

190
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:06,000
commonly targeted industry in the region

191
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,479
in terms of cyber security government

192
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:10,080
and the banking sector

193
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,400
now eve has taught talked about the

194
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,280
mobile money

195
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,840
market in the industry there's an 82

196
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:18,160
percent penetration of mobile money

197
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,960
in the sub-saharan africa region and

198
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:23,039
with this came the installation of new

199
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:24,400
atms because

200
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:27,360
people needed to convert the money the

201
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,759
digital money into physical cash

202
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:33,680
now this brought about new um other new

203
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:36,800
threats or attacks in that sector now

204
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:37,520
most

205
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,039
countries in the region have taken

206
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:41,680
advantage of mobile telecommunications

207
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,360
to expand their businesses

208
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,520
and attackers are using this as an

209
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:46,879
avenue to get

210
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:48,960
money and to get sensitive information

211
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,560
from these people

212
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:53,919
now one of the common attacks

213
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:56,319
are of course social engineering you've

214
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:58,560
heard of the sakawa boys or the

215
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:01,680
famous yahoo boys the nigerian prince

216
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:04,240
where they manipulate people into giving

217
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,039
them

218
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:06,720
sensitive information and most

219
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,319
importantly money

220
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:10,160
now the same threats are common in the

221
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,000
region where

222
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,879
in in like the m-pesa case you get

223
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:16,400
someone calling you

224
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,960
pretending to have sent you money and

225
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,080
then they ask for

226
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:23,199
for uh for a refund now for most people

227
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:25,759
or for most mobile security mobile

228
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:27,120
service providers

229
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,919
they have services that allows you

230
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:31,759
allows money to be refunded without the

231
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:34,080
customer actually refunding it back

232
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,479
themselves but most most people are not

233
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:37,519
aware of this

234
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:39,919
and they end up sending back money that

235
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:41,679
wasn't sent to them in the first place

236
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:42,880
and that's how people

237
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:45,920
end up losing money another

238
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:48,959
common thread is

239
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:52,160
sim swap now this is especially common

240
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:54,240
to people who use mobile money which as

241
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,920
i said are very many people

242
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:59,120
in in the sub-saharan africa region how

243
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:01,120
this works is that someone

244
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:03,519
um social engineers you by sending you

245
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:04,640
phishing links

246
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,160
and you end up giving them your

247
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:08,080
sensitive information mostly

248
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,440
your passwords and pin and other

249
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:12,000
identification

250
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,440
now using this identification uh they

251
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:19,600
they take your or steal your

252
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:21,760
your information and then call the

253
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,600
mobile service provider

254
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,080
asking them to block the sim card and

255
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:26,800
they say

256
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,720
i am the owner of the sim card these are

257
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,560
my registration details and they give

258
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,560
all these details that they have stolen

259
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:35,600
from the victim mainly their identity

260
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:38,720
their pins and passwords and all this

261
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:41,600
other identifying information now having

262
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,279
this information the mobile service

263
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:44,080
provider

264
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:47,120
will know that this is a legitimate case

265
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:50,240
of of someone who's lost their sim card

266
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,399
who who's lost their phone so they end

267
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:53,839
up blocking the

268
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:55,839
number of the person who's the

269
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:58,240
legitimate owner of this number

270
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:00,240
and then the attacker who now has the

271
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,279
new number

272
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:03,120
uses this new number to generate

273
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,480
one-time passwords

274
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,160
and with this one-time password they are

275
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,480
able to get into the victims

276
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:11,760
banking um online banking and steal

277
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:14,800
cash from them now that is one way that

278
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,839
attackers can get money from

279
00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:20,480
unsuspecting clients the other way

280
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,640
or one of the other common threads is

281
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,560
internal fraud which is more common in

282
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:26,399
the banking sector as well

283
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:30,959
here usually employees of banks or even

284
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:32,880
mobile service providers work with

285
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:35,680
outside attackers and they liaise and

286
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:38,079
they end up stealing money from

287
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:41,519
victims they mostly target diseased

288
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:42,480
clients

289
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:45,440
who may not someone may not be able to

290
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,200
follow up with this person's money

291
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,040
and that's how money is lost in the

292
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,399
banking sector

293
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:52,160
now we talked about the government being

294
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:54,480
one of the other hardest hit

295
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,959
industries last year in kenya for

296
00:10:56,959 --> 00:10:58,959
example that is in 2019

297
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:02,079
19 government sites were hacked in one

298
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:02,640
day

299
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:05,120
so these threats are common not just in

300
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:05,760
kenya but

301
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,920
other countries in sub-saharan africa as

302
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,440
well where

303
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:12,240
governments are targeted for information

304
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,120
for fun

305
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:15,839
and just for stealing sensitive

306
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:16,480
information

307
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,320
in case they have stored any of this

308
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:21,519
information in their sites

309
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,079
now what are some of the economic

310
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:26,160
effects of cyber crime

311
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:28,560
in sub-saharan africa a lot of countries

312
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:29,440
have lost

313
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:32,079
a big amount of money to cyber crime

314
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:34,800
south africa for example lost an 80

315
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:38,720
they lose an estimated 573 million

316
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:42,160
dollars annually while nigeria loses

317
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:45,040
500 million dollars annually as well and

318
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,800
kenya loses 36

319
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:49,200
million dollars annually now this in

320
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,519
proportion to the gdp of these countries

321
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:55,680
uh is very big lost to to cyber crime

322
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:56,639
and

323
00:11:56,639 --> 00:11:59,519
besides the economic losses there's also

324
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:01,680
um losses to individual companies where

325
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:02,320
they still

326
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,399
they they lose sensitive information

327
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:05,760
they lose clients

328
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:08,000
and they lose money as well so there are

329
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,160
a lot of um

330
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:14,079
very many cyber effects to cyber crime

331
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:15,519
that has affected the people of

332
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:18,800
sub-sahara and africa

333
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:21,200
so if he's going to take us through some

334
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,240
of the challenges

335
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,160
and some of the things that have worked

336
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,680
in the past

337
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:28,000
so i'm going to take you through the

338
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,360
different challenges

339
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:32,240
uh that the sub-saharan africa region

340
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:34,480
faced with regards to cyber security

341
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:35,360
threats

342
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,760
one of them is poor data security

343
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:38,959
practices

344
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:41,920
so with that fraudulent parties can

345
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:42,720
access

346
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:45,200
our personal data which leads to

347
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,480
identity theft

348
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:49,200
and with identity theft it can lead to

349
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,000
sim swap

350
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,800
as laura mentioned earlier secondly we

351
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,560
have skills gap

352
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:57,120
with skills gap most in most tertiary

353
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,959
institutions do not offer

354
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:01,519
cyber cyber security courses as part of

355
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:03,600
the curriculum at the moment

356
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:06,560
and also employers are not focused in

357
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:08,399
training the different staff that they

358
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:09,279
have

359
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:12,320
with regards to cyber security also

360
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,560
there's a lack of awareness part most

361
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,480
organizations are not aware

362
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,639
about their cyber security threats they

363
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:20,800
face on a day-to-day activities

364
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,839
which creates a point of

365
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:26,320
failure with regards to managing cyber

366
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,360
threats in

367
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,920
the different organizations that we have

368
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,040
there's also

369
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:33,200
the poor implementation of cyber

370
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,399
security tools

371
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:37,440
with regards to poor implementation

372
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,519
there's the aspects as i mentioned

373
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:40,959
earlier

374
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:45,760
known as as skills gap with skills gap

375
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:49,199
with a skills gap aspect not many staff

376
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:52,480
are are are able to

377
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:55,920
manage setting up the cyber security

378
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:58,079
solutions in the organizations

379
00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:00,320
according to the required format and

380
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:02,560
also most organizations just implement

381
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,079
cybersecurity tools

382
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:07,120
as part of compliance to ascertain a

383
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,360
risk or gap that was identified in the

384
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,839
organizational systems

385
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:14,880
so additionally we have most

386
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,480
organizations in

387
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:20,079
in sub-saharan if africa region have

388
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:24,880
limited budget to cyber security

389
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:27,760
it's now 96 percent of african

390
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:30,399
organizations have an annual budget of

391
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:33,600
five thousand dollars for cyber security

392
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,360
there's also the aspect of use of

393
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:38,079
generic accounts with generic accounts

394
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:41,040
um use of generic accounts and shared

395
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,000
passwords

396
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,040
so with generic accounts um anyone and

397
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:45,600
everyone

398
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,920
anyone who has access to that particular

399
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,199
generic account

400
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:53,360
can access the different uh

401
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,279
systems in the organization that could

402
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:57,199
be one of them could be co-banking

403
00:14:57,199 --> 00:14:58,240
platforms

404
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:00,880
uh in the different banking sectors that

405
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:01,680
we have

406
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:04,320
and also as laura mentioned earlier this

407
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,519
could lead to

408
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:08,639
internal fraud which which

409
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:11,519
impacts organization and leads to loss

410
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:12,639
of revenue

411
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:16,079
and economical and has a higher impact

412
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:16,560
on the

413
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:20,240
economy for that particular organization

414
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:22,959
there's also the lack of segregation of

415
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:23,920
duties

416
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:26,959
with that i t secure

417
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:29,440
cyber security is is part of the i.t

418
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:31,120
operations team

419
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:33,759
in that way there's no team that is

420
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:34,720
fully focused

421
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:38,480
to set up cyber security solutions for

422
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,480
the organization

423
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,639
okay let's look at what has worked in

424
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:45,199
the past with regards to cyber security

425
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:46,320
awareness in the

426
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:49,120
sub-saharan africa region among the key

427
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,880
drivers for that is

428
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:53,600
communities communities offer trainings

429
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,199
and also

430
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:57,040
offer trainings to the different

431
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,240
community members

432
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,759
which creates more awareness with

433
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:02,160
regards to cyber security in the region

434
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:04,720
so among the communities are shahax

435
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,560
which laura mentioned earlier

436
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,639
and also we have other communities in

437
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:10,079
kenya namely

438
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:12,959
afrika hakone and kcsfa there are also

439
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:14,639
communities in nigeria

440
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:18,079
that is ashish secures and niger second

441
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:20,880
there's also hackathon girls in gambia

442
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,480
so with these communities

443
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,800
they are key drivers of creating cyber

444
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,800
security awareness in the region

445
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:29,519
so with more cyber security awareness

446
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:31,519
different community members are able to

447
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:32,959
adapt to professional

448
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:36,000
cyber security certifications but that

449
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,079
creates better opportunities

450
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:41,199
in their field for the different

451
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:44,639
community members additionally there's

452
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:45,279
also

453
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:48,959
local support one of the key examples is

454
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:51,120
equal innovation hub that offer

455
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,320
mentorship

456
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:56,000
and also of mentorship and training to

457
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,360
the local talent

458
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:00,160
they also offer opportunities to their

459
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:00,720
local

460
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:04,559
talent we also have safaricom that have

461
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:07,439
a bounty program where local security

462
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:09,359
researchers are able to

463
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:11,760
participate in it and identify the

464
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,599
different threats

465
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:15,760
with with regards to the items that are

466
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:18,079
exposed publicly for them to

467
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:21,760
to look at there's also

468
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:23,039
there's also the aspect of

469
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:25,359
collaborations so um

470
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:27,439
with regards to communities we have

471
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:28,960
local collaborations

472
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:31,600
with the different communities in the

473
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:32,720
region

474
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:36,880
um this is there's also an example of

475
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:40,320
cross-continent um collaboration

476
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:43,360
one of the key examples is of course who

477
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:44,000
have

478
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,600
really supported different communities

479
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:51,600
in kenya and also in somalia

480
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:56,240
other key drivers are conferences and

481
00:17:56,240 --> 00:18:00,000
in kenya last year we had we annually

482
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,799
we have conferences that protect this

483
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:03,600
this uh

484
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,440
the aspect of building creating more

485
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:06,880
awareness

486
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:09,360
with regards to cyber security in the

487
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:10,160
region

488
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:13,360
so uh last year she has had hack first

489
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:16,640
that created more awareness to different

490
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,160
members in the community

491
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:20,320
we also had africa harcon which is an

492
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:22,080
annual conference also

493
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:24,559
additionally outside the the kenyan

494
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:25,520
region we have

495
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:28,080
other regions like nigeria who normally

496
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:28,799
have

497
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:32,160
niger second annually to bring together

498
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:34,080
community members and

499
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,679
create more awareness with regards to

500
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:37,760
cyber security

501
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:40,720
yeah they're also locally built tools

502
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,880
one of them is smart framework that was

503
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,720
developed by christian

504
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:48,400
and that is that is mostly focused

505
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:52,000
on mobile security testing we also have

506
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,600
[Music]

507
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:56,559
our top 10 vulnerability scanner that

508
00:18:56,559 --> 00:18:57,600
was developed by

509
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:00,880
one of the security searches called unir

510
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:04,160
in the region we also have a security

511
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:04,799
scanner

512
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:08,160
for a big big

513
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:13,120
for big f5 uh big ip devices

514
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:16,240
ff5 notably by

515
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:19,760
one of the security such as in nigeria

516
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:20,240
by

517
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:23,440
the name rotimi they're also

518
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:25,600
there are also regulatory bodies that

519
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,280
provide guidance

520
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:32,000
with regards to cyber security and

521
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,630
the key elements that different

522
00:19:34,630 --> 00:19:36,240
[Music]

523
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,400
different organizations have to comply

524
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,559
with one of the key examples in the

525
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:43,200
eastern africa region is central banks

526
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:46,880
central banks of offer regulatory

527
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:49,039
regulatory guidelines to the different

528
00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:50,640
banking institutions

529
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:53,440
so the different banks in the region are

530
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:54,880
required to

531
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:58,640
to to to do an annual security and

532
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:01,840
its it audit for

533
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:05,360
it audit for those organizations yeah

534
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:07,600
so with regards to that um this creates

535
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,280
a better landscape

536
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:12,080
a better robot a better and robust cyber

537
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:13,280
security

538
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:17,679
um posture in the region

539
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:21,679
so um i know

540
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:23,679
welcome laura to take us through how we

541
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:25,360
can make

542
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:27,120
the different solutions in the region

543
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:28,480
better

544
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:31,120
so now that we have looked at one of

545
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:32,480
some of the things that have worked in

546
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:33,200
the past

547
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,919
how can we make these solutions better

548
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:38,240
so in the beginning of this presentation

549
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:40,159
we mentioned the four questions that we

550
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:41,200
came up with

551
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:44,320
to to try and figure out how we can

552
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:46,559
create strategies create curriculum for

553
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:48,080
the cyber security industry

554
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:51,280
in sub-saharan africa we talked about

555
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:53,600
the threat landscape in the region we

556
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,440
looked at some of the

557
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:57,760
technologies that are most used in the

558
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,840
region we also looked at things that

559
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:01,679
have worked in the past

560
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:05,440
so how do we make the solutions better

561
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:08,480
the first way or the the place to start

562
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,240
is to have more conversation

563
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:11,919
which is what we are actually doing now

564
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:13,600
with this conference we are trying to

565
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:16,080
reach out to more stakeholders

566
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:17,760
namely governments education

567
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,840
institutions the different

568
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:21,760
experts cyber security experts that we

569
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:23,039
have in the region

570
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:25,360
and policy makers as well we are trying

571
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:27,120
to have these conversations with them on

572
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,880
how can we further develop the cyber

573
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:31,919
security industry in the region

574
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:34,799
the second thing is investing in more

575
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:36,320
research and development

576
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:39,440
this is in terms of the data that

577
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:41,440
we need in order to come up with better

578
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:43,520
solutions and also the tools

579
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:45,600
that we need uh you've talked about some

580
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,720
of the locally built

581
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:50,240
tools like the mara framework and the os

582
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:52,960
uh web application testing framework

583
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,720
that were developed by

584
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:57,520
members of the community so we need more

585
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:59,679
research and development in terms of

586
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:01,360
the tools and the solutions that can

587
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:03,600
work in the region

588
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:06,080
also supporting regional talents is one

589
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:09,760
way that you can make the cyber security

590
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:12,400
stronger in this region so we talked

591
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,120
about how

592
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:16,159
equal innovation hub supports local

593
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:18,320
talent by providing mentorship and also

594
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:19,760
opportunities for them

595
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:21,760
so we need more organizations local

596
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:22,880
organizations

597
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:26,159
to support local talent

598
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:28,640
in the recent past we've had cases where

599
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:31,360
bigger organizations would invite

600
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:35,200
or hire experts from other

601
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:38,080
regions outside of africa to come and do

602
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,200
the different

603
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:41,600
security testing for them now we want

604
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:42,240
them to

605
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:44,000
support local talent because what we're

606
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,400
saying is we have people who are capable

607
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,000
we have people who have the knowledge

608
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:48,960
and the skills

609
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:53,120
to do this for our own organizations

610
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:55,200
the fourth and i believe one of the most

611
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,960
important things that we should look

612
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:00,320
into is education there's luck

613
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:04,080
or very little education with regards to

614
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:06,400
cyber security in the region i'll give

615
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,480
an example of kenya where we only have

616
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:11,520
two or two education institutions that

617
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,679
offer cybersecurity as a course

618
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:16,559
now these two are all both private

619
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:17,600
institutions

620
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:20,400
which means that not everyone can afford

621
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:20,840
to

622
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:24,320
study or to take up cyber security as a

623
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:24,799
course

624
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:27,600
in in college now this is why

625
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:29,120
communities step in

626
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:31,280
but at the end of the day we also need

627
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:33,760
our education system to

628
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:36,640
update their curriculum to include the

629
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:37,200
more

630
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:42,159
recent or some of the most commonly

631
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:44,480
commonly used technologies in this

632
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:45,679
period of time

633
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:47,840
so we need educational institutions to

634
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:48,720
support

635
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,720
or to include cyber security in their

636
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:52,080
curriculum

637
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:55,039
and the fifth one is cheaper solutions

638
00:23:55,039 --> 00:23:56,480
now we talked about how

639
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:59,279
most organizations in sub-saharan africa

640
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:01,440
only set aside a budget of five thousand

641
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:02,000
dollars

642
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,320
annually to support cyber security

643
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:05,279
operations

644
00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:08,880
now this is not nearly enough uh but

645
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:11,200
unfortunately it also reflects our

646
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,240
economy

647
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:14,640
so we need solutions that are more

648
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:15,520
affordable

649
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:18,080
for the different organizations that are

650
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:19,120
more

651
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:22,480
reliable effective and also reachable

652
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:25,679
so we're asking um individuals

653
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:27,440
organizations communities to come

654
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:28,240
together

655
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:31,279
to to look at ways or in which we can

656
00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:32,400
offer

657
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:35,200
affordable cheaper effective solutions

658
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:37,200
to cyber security to the to support the

659
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,960
cyber security market

660
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:41,840
in the sub-saharan region so that has

661
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:43,279
been our presentation

662
00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:45,520
we are hoping that you have learned a

663
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:47,520
little about the cyber security

664
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:50,159
landscape in the sub-saharan region some

665
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:51,520
of the things that have worked

666
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:53,120
and some of the ways that you could

667
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:55,440
support us or we could learn from you

668
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:57,760
in order to implement proper strategies

669
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:59,360
in the future

670
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:01,440
thank you so much and we now open the

671
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,799
flow to questions

672
00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:05,200
thank you

673
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:08,400
hey

674
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:15,840
there we are yeah

675
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:24,240
and thank you so much guys for attending

676
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:24,880
our

677
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:27,679
session today so we've seen a lot of

678
00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:28,960
questions

679
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:33,600
um yes it is so there's some questions

680
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:36,720
um the first one by maddie um i think

681
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:37,600
we've answered that

682
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:39,520
is mobile money meaning like paying with

683
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:41,279
your phone like apple pay

684
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:46,559
um so as we said

685
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:57,840
um

686
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:06,320
there was also a question can you

687
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:08,480
provide example certifications like

688
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:09,039
leverage

689
00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:13,440
to protect our consumers by using and

690
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:25,520
present

691
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:27,679
sorry about that there's a delay in the

692
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:30,080
feedback so we don't know when

693
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:32,400
to start but yeah as you said our

694
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,240
empress our money it's mobile

695
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:37,279
based money transfer and you can pay for

696
00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:38,799
goods using

697
00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:53,840
we have two numbers we have pay bills

698
00:26:59,230 --> 00:27:02,309
[Music]

699
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:07,840
okay

700
00:27:28,399 --> 00:27:34,000
and in here here are so

701
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,520
oh yes if you can go ahead

702
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,440
so um i wanted to point to a question on

703
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:50,559
what are the different ways of um

704
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:55,440
of uh how we protect uh consumers as

705
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:58,559
well using impress so we have uh

706
00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:00,880
two concrete ways one is a platform

707
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:02,159
called pakistan

708
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:04,960
which means uh it gives you a platform

709
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:06,640
to confirm the person

710
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:09,200
you're sending money to or you're

711
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:10,720
transferring money

712
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:13,440
this enables someone to confirm exactly

713
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,159
that

714
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:15,840
the person the recipient of that

715
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:17,360
particular um

716
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:20,000
amount is the same path that they are

717
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:20,640
intending to

718
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:23,520
send to there's also if by any child

719
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:24,000
spend

720
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,520
money to a wrong number

721
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:29,919
the support number two three four that

722
00:28:29,919 --> 00:28:30,640
you stand

723
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:33,840
particular translation so

724
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:37,120
that you're able to get within a limit

725
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:45,840
of one minute

726
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:59,840
um

727
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:15,919
so that we're able to get thinner people

728
00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:38,000
there was also a question he got to find

729
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:41,760
the budget so we try we draw we

730
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:46,240
we establish that figure the different

731
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:47,840
documents that you're able to find

732
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:50,320
online

733
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:52,320
all right so we just share the links to

734
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:53,679
that

735
00:29:53,679 --> 00:29:56,159
and this

736
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:05,760
uh yeah so there's the question of does

737
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:07,760
the use of open security officer

738
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:09,600
security tools help with the needing

739
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:11,760
cheaper tools problem

740
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:14,960
yes there's that and it does

741
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:18,080
help a little bit

742
00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:21,279
um it does help a little bit but some of

743
00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:22,000
these tools

744
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,760
are not really helpful to what we do

745
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:28,880
sometimes so we talked about the mara

746
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:30,559
framework and how

747
00:30:30,559 --> 00:30:33,760
it's um we use it for mobile application

748
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:35,360
security testing

749
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:37,279
and we talked about some of the other

750
00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:39,120
tools that were developed by the os

751
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:42,960
community in kenya so these tools are

752
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:44,960
very helpful but sometimes they're

753
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:46,960
limited in terms of

754
00:30:46,960 --> 00:31:05,840
what we can achieve using them yeah

755
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:08,960
i think what kind of concerns do you do

756
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:09,840
you have about

757
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:13,120
using foreign investments us eu china to

758
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:15,440
support information infrastructure

759
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:18,240
in ssa i think with regards to that um

760
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:20,640
there is already an ongoing

761
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:23,279
way an ongoing conversation with a

762
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:23,919
different

763
00:31:23,919 --> 00:31:27,679
organization like huawei cisco

764
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:29,760
to support us on the different defense

765
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:32,240
mechanisms that we have in the region

766
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:34,240
and most of us are consumers of the

767
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:35,600
products that they have

768
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:38,000
to create a difference in the platforms

769
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:47,840
for the different organization

770
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:17,840
i think there's one last question i can

771
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:18,559
pick

772
00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:22,840
what crowd controls are in place for the

773
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:24,240
electronics

774
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:26,880
so for that one there's always occur for

775
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:27,760
the different

776
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:30,799
transactions that are different from

777
00:33:30,799 --> 00:33:32,640
others

778
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:35,760
so if it first surpasses that there's

779
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:36,480
always

780
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:39,120
an element

781
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:53,840
in the same time so in that you're able

782
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:54,640
to pick a

783
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:59,679
fraudulent activity from the

784
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:07,840
different

785
00:34:43,918 --> 00:34:45,679
um guys we'll get to answer your

786
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:48,000
questions please reach out to us

787
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:51,280

788
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:53,839

789
00:34:53,839 --> 00:34:55,359
up this conversation

790
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:57,040
uh we're going to wrap up now we only

791
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:59,200

792
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:02,400
