1
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:07,120
because uh

2
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:10,719
uh as as an employer

3
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:12,559
i don't i don't want to see deputies

4
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:14,400
going to fake calls

5
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:17,520
at 100 plus miles an hour to get

6
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,039
somewhere when somebody says i'm just

7
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:21,279
checking your response time

8
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:22,720
that doesn't that doesn't work well

9
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:24,000
because if one of your family members

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,760
was t-boned by a deputy

11
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:27,760
you'd be mad especially when you found

12
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:29,279
out it was a fake call or something like

13
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:31,599
that they needed to be rested

14
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:34,719
you're going to try to break in period

15
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:37,760
lock them up i don't care you know

16
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:39,280
we didn't do it we didn't charge these

17
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:41,200
two gentlemen for

18
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,800
because we wanted to or we were trying

19
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,000
to make a statement there's nothing

20
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,280
political or

21
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:46,719
all these things these comments that are

22
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:49,680
being made none of that stuff came into

23
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,280
if you look out there i've never made a

24
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:52,800
single statement period

25
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,640
never done a single press release never

26
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:56,079
done anything

27
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:58,399
you know this is a confusing case

28
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:00,230
hopefully it'll wash out at the end

29
00:01:00,230 --> 00:01:01,680
[Music]

30
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:03,199
this belongs to the corporate county

31
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:13,840
this don't belong to the state mm-hmm

32
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:26,960
the world's a dumpster fire and

33
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:28,720
everybody's mind is gone and if they

34
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:29,360
hadn't said

35
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:32,079
something these guys would have just

36
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:32,400
been

37
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,079
forgotten no other than without the

38
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:35,439
public pressure maybe

39
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:36,640
their their case would have gone a

40
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,640
different way i don't know

41
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,960
um

42
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:45,119
nowadays lawyers still want to squash

43
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:46,720
people and say never talk

44
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:49,119
but if you don't talk everyone else is

45
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:50,320
talking for you

46
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:54,880
and it gets worse and worse

47
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,799
hello everyone i'm justin and i'm gary

48
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:58,479
and we are senior security consultants

49
00:01:58,479 --> 00:01:59,840
with coal fire systems

50
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,360
we are here today to talk to you about

51
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,119
the chronicles of iowa

52
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:05,439
and the events that unfolded there

53
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:06,640
hopefully we're going to dispel

54
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,318
a lot of the misinformation and myths

55
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:09,758
that may have come up and coming to the

56
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:11,520
media's light during that while we were

57
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,520
legally gagged so without further ado

58
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,560
we'd like to walk you through the

59
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:15,520
process

60
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:18,800
well not being gay all right to set the

61
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,080
stage let's go through some of the

62
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,319
engagement details so this is a scoping

63
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:23,840
and charter process that takes place

64
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,360
before we're ever brought onto an

65
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,879
engagement when the client contracts

66
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:27,680
with coal fire

67
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,680
they fill out some forms that details

68
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,200
overall what they're looking for

69
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,800
in this particular engagement it was a

70
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,400
red team engagement which covers all

71
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,680
attack services but the one that we're

72
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:36,080
most

73
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,840
concerned about today is the physical

74
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,760
engagement this is where the client

75
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,519
wanted us to come on site test security

76
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:43,360
of the courthouse's judicial buildings

77
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,640
things of that nature

78
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,239
and from that process see if you can

79
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:48,080
plant a drone on the internal network

80
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,680
and then do the internal network

81
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,440
penetration test down the road

82
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:52,959
so when we're discussing the physical

83
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:54,800
engagement details the client was

84
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,640
specifically requesting please focus on

85
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,319
after hours testing we want to see what

86
00:02:58,319 --> 00:02:58,879
can be done

87
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:01,280
in a real life scenario like that and

88
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,800
some of the confusion that happened in

89
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:03,360
here

90
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,519
was the hours in the daytime the daytime

91
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:07,280
testing versus the evening testing

92
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,720
what was released in the medium

93
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,640
partially from the client's perspective

94
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:11,280
was

95
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,519
well we didn't want nighttime testing

96
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:14,879
and we didn't want after-hours testing

97
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:16,159
was only supposed to be during the day

98
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:16,640
hence

99
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,560
the day in the evening the reality of

100
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,400
that story was when they first came to

101
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:20,640
us

102
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:23,599
they only wanted physical pin testing at

103
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:24,879
night after hours

104
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:27,360
the actuality of what changed was they

105
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:27,920
said

106
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,120
after speaking to us in the charter

107
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,040
calls you know what we really do want

108
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,560
social engineering during the day

109
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,080
we want to test some of our employees we

110
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,000
want to do it during the day so can we

111
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:36,640
add day

112
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,239
and evening to that testing to make sure

113
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:40,239
that we encompass the social engineering

114
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:42,720
so the truth of that story is originally

115
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:43,519
it was night

116
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:45,680
we changed it and amended that to day

117
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,680
and evening to encompass the daytime

118
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:48,319
portion

119
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:50,080
of the social engineering and to

120
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,840
cooperate our story was actually five

121
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,120
people on the phone it wasn't just

122
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,879
us and the client there was two out of

123
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:56,239
the three clients came

124
00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:58,640
um came to the charter call along with

125
00:03:58,640 --> 00:03:59,599
myself

126
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:01,360
justin another pintester who actually

127
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,200
didn't make it due to family issues

128
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,439
our project manager and the director all

129
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:07,760
of them ended up giving out testimony

130
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,280
all corroborating our stories saying

131
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,879
this is exactly what happened just as we

132
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:11,680
said it was

133
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,840
from uh from at least five different

134
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,360
viewpoints from us

135
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:18,079
yep all aligned in that in that idea um

136
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:19,680
so another point of contention that

137
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,839
kind of crept up again related to the

138
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:23,759
hours when judicial branch accused us of

139
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:25,199
being out of scope or testing when they

140
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:26,320
weren't expecting it

141
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,000
was the default boilerplate template

142
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,360
that we have in there says we're only

143
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,800
going to conduct network penetration

144
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,120
testing between 6am and 6pm

145
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,400
when we're on the calls with the client

146
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,600
of course it's understood and we

147
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,639
communicated with them

148
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:38,240
when we're doing a physical engagement

149
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,400
this is likely to occur over 24 hours of

150
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,040
the day

151
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,720
as long as that's amenable to you and so

152
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:43,919
we kind of clear that up and that's

153
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:45,280
where we put that field that can be

154
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,639
during day and evening

155
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:48,160
in relation to the physical penetration

156
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,520
testing where all the virtual stuff

157
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:50,639
we've done before that

158
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:53,440
was within business hours um another

159
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,560
point to that as well

160
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,560
is the social engineer or the letter of

161
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,080
authorization rather

162
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,800
uh scoped us to begin testing on sunday

163
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:01,280
so

164
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,039
if we're coming on site to iowa to

165
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:04,560
assess government buildings

166
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,000
nothing's going to be open on sunday but

167
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,680
that's when we're slated to begin again

168
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,440
because the client wanted us to test

169
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,120
outside of business that's important

170
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:14,000
that comes up later

171
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,199
all right so these are the target

172
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:16,960
locations client had outlined five

173
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,720
locations that they wanted us to assess

174
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,160
we did walk through these individually

175
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,520
we asked questions like who's going to

176
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,039
be there after hours if we encounter

177
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:24,800
anybody are there armed guards what's

178
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,400
the maintenance crew look like what is

179
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,840
it what is the cleaning crew schedule

180
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:28,639
look like

181
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:31,120
um and we have specific uh limitations

182
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,479
on some of these locations so some of

183
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:34,000
those did arise like the criminal

184
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,039
justice center

185
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:36,880
client told us we only own a server rack

186
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,479
inside this building we do not have

187
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:40,160
authorization to perform a physical

188
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,199
penetration test

189
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:42,720
but what you can do is a social

190
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,560
engineering exercise go in

191
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,560
ask them flash them a fake business card

192
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,000
see if you can gain access to the server

193
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:48,639
closet

194
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:50,080
other than that the restrictions were

195
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,360
placed around the judicial branch

196
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,360
building don't access floors three or

197
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,960
four or maybe open a door and take a

198
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,400
proof of concept that you guys could

199
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,199
access that

200
00:05:57,199 --> 00:05:59,120
but don't actually go in as far as

201
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,800
anything else it was full scope

202
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,479
access reach facility and try to gain

203
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:03,840
access to the internal network

204
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,280
and show us what other vulnerabilities

205
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,800
you find while you're on site and this

206
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:07,520
in this

207
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:08,880
conversation that we're having with the

208
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,560
client isn't isn't a

209
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:13,759
quick conversation this is line by line

210
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:15,759
building by building address by address

211
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:17,680
what exactly do you want us to perform

212
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,039
in this building what are the hours you

213
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:20,880
want us to do it what's in scope what's

214
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:21,600
out of scope

215
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,240
per building so if there would have been

216
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,919
a miscommunication which there wasn't at

217
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:26,720
the time

218
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,720
it would have been fleshed out in this

219
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,240
call because we went building by

220
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:30,880
building

221
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,880
exactly what was in scope what wasn't in

222
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,000
scope per building

223
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,360
now what makes it into the actual

224
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,039
contract is a little more generalized

225
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:38,400
which is why we have the scoping call

226
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:41,360
let's learn from this record your calls

227
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:44,080
yeah very important all right so we have

228
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,600
a number of parties involved of course

229
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,039
there's coal fire the company that we

230
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:49,280
work for there's gary and myself who had

231
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,199
charges pressed individually against us

232
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:52,319
that makes an important legal

233
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:53,599
distinction that we'll see there's a

234
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:54,639
difference between the company that

235
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:56,160
you're working for and when charges were

236
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,240
pressed against us as individuals

237
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,840
you have dallas county which was

238
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,840
primarily comprised of sheriff chad

239
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,440
leonard and the county attorney chuck

240
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,160
cenar

241
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,319
we also have the iowa judicial branch so

242
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:07,759
our three points of contact that we were

243
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:09,280
working for mark hedley

244
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,800
john hoover and andrew shirley and

245
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,400
there's also going to be a special guest

246
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,759
appearance from somebody that we'll see

247
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:16,240
later in the presentation

248
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,280
all right so now what we're going to do

249
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,800
is we're going to run you through kind

250
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:19,520
of a real

251
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,840
quick uh story of events on sunday

252
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:22,800
monday and then

253
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,319
a little bit of tuesday before we

254
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:26,560
actually went to new dallas county

255
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,960
to the fabled courthouse sunday we hit

256
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,400
the ground running uh we were there

257
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:31,919
again like we had said before

258
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:34,240
our third teammate had some uh some

259
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,759
family health issues with one of his

260
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:36,319
relatives

261
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:38,800
so he couldn't actually come and the bad

262
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,479
part about that is is he had

263
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:41,840
the drone that we were gonna use so we

264
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:42,960
were still waiting on the drone to come

265
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,479
in the mail on i think it was

266
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:45,759
supposed to be there monday or tuesday

267
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:47,680
which is why we ended up going back to

268
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,199
the polk county courthouse later

269
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:50,960
was to set the drone in the server room

270
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,960
so sunday we hit we hit the ground

271
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:53,520
running

272
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:56,160
we we go after the polk county historic

273
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,039
courthouse

274
00:07:57,039 --> 00:07:59,280
we get in we get in through uh bypassing

275
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,879
it bypassing a door

276
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:02,400
and then we hit all flags we're probably

277
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,919
there until one or two in the morning

278
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:04,960
something like that

279
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,800
um all the value that the customer was

280
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,400
looking for and then some

281
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,000
uh we were able to get in that single

282
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,080
night so for the most part outside of

283
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:14,000
coming back there and placing the drone

284
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,280
that was done and then

285
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:17,680
monday justin will go into all right so

286
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:18,960
we wake up the following day

287
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,960
um that's our first full day while we're

288
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,479
on site so we decided to drive by all

289
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:24,080
the locations make sure the addresses

290
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,759
match up to what we're seeing online and

291
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:27,039
talking with the client about

292
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:28,800
and we just verify everything's there

293
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,319
during public hours we are able to

294
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:32,240
access the judicial branch

295
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:34,399
and the dallas county courthouse during

296
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:35,679
business hours we're able to walk

297
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:37,120
through see some of the stuff

298
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,880
in judicial branch we're escorted by an

299
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,640
armed guard who didn't let us leave

300
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,159
inside and then for the dallas county

301
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:43,919
courthouse it's open public access so we

302
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:45,360
were able to see some of the floors

303
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,880
and the purpose of that is to walk

304
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,080
through get an idea of what we're

305
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,600
working with so when we come back later

306
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,320
that night

307
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,760
we know how to approach it and what to

308
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:54,080
be looking out for so the real me of

309
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,000
tuesday is we enter and we breach the

310
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,200
judicial branch um

311
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,880
actually we arrive on site we're outside

312
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,399
working on a door for about 10 or 15

313
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:00,959
minutes

314
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:02,880
when a state trooper arrives so this is

315
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,240
kind of expected behavior

316
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,839
um the client had informed us there are

317
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:08,399
patrols after hours from 5 pm to 6 a.m

318
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:09,519
at this location

319
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:11,519
you may run into state trooper so he

320
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:13,120
arrives says hey gentlemen how's it

321
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,200
going as we have tools inside a door

322
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,880
we look back and say hey officer how are

323
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,640
you he's like great uh just

324
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,959
checking what you guys are up to is the

325
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:22,880
security testing we say yep we're hired

326
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,959
by coal fire um and hired by the

327
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:26,800
state judicial branch to test security

328
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,800
of some facilities here he says great no

329
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,000
problem that's pretty routine we

330
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,279
actually do this testing regularly

331
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:32,800
sometimes they give us a heads up before

332
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:33,120
this

333
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,880
this time they didn't but do you have a

334
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,320
business card is there some way you can

335
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,279
verify yourselves

336
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:38,640
so give him a business card he's

337
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:39,839
satisfied and that's the end of the

338
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:40,880
encounter

339
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:43,519
um afterwards we end up making access we

340
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:44,399
make uh entry

341
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:46,720
into that building um we go through and

342
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:47,519
again we start

343
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:49,279
elevating privileges checking off

344
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:50,800
findings indoors like we're looking for

345
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,160
clean desk policies

346
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:54,080
uh seeing what a malicious actor could

347
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,600
do while we're actually inside and

348
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,279
telling the client how to remediate

349
00:09:57,279 --> 00:09:58,480
those vulnerabilities

350
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,320
so throughout this process we end up

351
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,560
getting into the iet offices

352
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:03,920
where we find our point of contact's

353
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:05,920
desk uh leave a business card there for

354
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:06,399
him

355
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:07,600
next morning first thing in the morning

356
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,519
when he walks in he sees the card and he

357
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:11,040
shoots me an email he says

358
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,120
well i guess i owe you congratulations

359
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:15,440
i'll be curious to see how easy this was

360
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,360
um well we didn't find out until later

361
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,560
right at that same time

362
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:20,079
uh he actually pulled the guys together

363
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:21,760
all our points of contact they reviewed

364
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,440
the footage they saw how we got in

365
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,880
what tools we were using what we

366
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,399
performed while we were on site and most

367
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:27,200
importantly

368
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,200
the hours and nature of testing so

369
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,200
offensive in nature after hours

370
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,560
and they didn't raise any flags they

371
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,160
didn't decide to call us and say hey

372
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:35,440
stop testing this isn't what we were

373
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,240
expecting

374
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,839
because we were performing the contract

375
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:39,680
exactly how they requested yeah and you

376
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:40,959
couple that with

377
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:43,279
our our get out of jail free card

378
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:44,640
started on sunday

379
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,320
and so you couple that with we're there

380
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,920
on sunday already outside of business

381
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:49,040
hours we're already

382
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,560
we're already doing that now we're in

383
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:51,839
this other building outside of business

384
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:53,600
hours we're testing they saw us there

385
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,519
they gave it a congratulatory emails and

386
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:56,720
we're really looking forward to the

387
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:57,519
engagement

388
00:10:57,519 --> 00:10:59,360
so now we've already have these all

389
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,800
these green flags as far as

390
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,079
we're concerned that everything is going

391
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:04,160
well and everything is great up to and

392
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:04,959
including

393
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:07,519
the state trooper that showed up on time

394
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:08,800
they gave us the time he was supposed to

395
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,320
be there we were expecting him knowing

396
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,920
that he could come around the corner

397
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,920
any minute and lo and behold just when

398
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,760
our client told us that this trooper

399
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:16,399
would be there

400
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:18,640
the trooper ends up showing up and so as

401
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:20,160
of right now to this point in the

402
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:20,959
engagement

403
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:22,480
everything is going along perfectly

404
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,480
exactly how it was said in the chart

405
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,240
right so we wrap things up on monday

406
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:28,000
night end up with the judicial branch

407
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,680
the next day tuesday we come back we

408
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,279
breach a few more facilities so at that

409
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:31,839
point

410
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:33,760
we have reached three facilities no

411
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,360
alarms have gone off that have prompted

412
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,880
a law enforcement response it's just

413
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,240
kind of happenstance that we ran into

414
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,760
the state trooper earlier but we're

415
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,360
becoming very concerned okay we're

416
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,040
assessing government facilities

417
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:45,200
no alarms are going off whatsoever and

418
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,640
we did notice there is an alarm panel

419
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,000
from our walkthrough during the daily

420
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,160
hours at the dallas county courthouse

421
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,079
they do have an alarm system in place

422
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:53,519
when we go up later tonight

423
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:55,279
we're hoping that alarm goes off and we

424
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:57,600
actually see a police response

425
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:01,760
misguided hope yes yep 2020

426
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:05,360
learn some lessons all right so now to

427
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:06,560
the meat of the story what everybody

428
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,000
really wants to hear is what happened to

429
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,120
dallas county

430
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,519
we got there at about 11 30 on tuesday

431
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:12,959
night 11 30 on tuesday night which would

432
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:14,240
have been september 10th

433
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,800
um we walked around we did we did just a

434
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,639
a a brief walk around

435
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:19,760
the building just to make sure that

436
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,600
there was nothing wonky going on we come

437
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:22,880
up to the front door which by the way if

438
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:23,920
you turn if you're looking at the

439
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,279
building like this you turn around

440
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:26,880
the sheriff's department is literally at

441
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,000
our back as we're looking at the

442
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:28,959
courthouse so

443
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:30,320
it wasn't any surprise that the

444
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,399
sheriff's department was right behind us

445
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:34,160
uh we go and justin grabs the door and

446
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:35,920
the door is actually open and we're

447
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:37,680
like oh my goodness look at this but of

448
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,200
course we're not there to

449
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,720
to walk through open doors we're there

450
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,560
to make sure that the the building

451
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,639
once in a secure state is actually

452
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:46,639
really secure so justin closes the door

453
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:48,480
we're able to bypass the door we get in

454
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:51,040
and we hear the initial alarm go off

455
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:53,040
which is that 30 seconds or so that you

456
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:53,440
have

457
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,800
when you open the door the alarm

458
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,320
triggers and then you've got that 30

459
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,680
seconds to actually punch in the code we

460
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:59,600
tried all the default codes that we knew

461
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,519
offhand none of them worked and so

462
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:02,959
eventually the alarm goes off

463
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:04,480
in which case we said well how would you

464
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,079
like to proceed let's just hang out wait

465
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:06,639
and see

466
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:08,399
if there was response because again

467
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:09,839
there hadn't been any response up to

468
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:10,480
this point

469
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,160
we make it to the third floor we bypass

470
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:13,680
a couple doors we're in a courtroom

471
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,440
and at which point we look out and there

472
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,200
is a city police officer that has

473
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,639
already spawned

474
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:20,399
wick responds time too probably the

475
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:21,920
fastest response time

476
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,279
and give credit where credit is due the

477
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:25,360
fastest response time we have ever seen

478
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:28,079
like literally literally three minutes

479
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:28,720
um so

480
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,160
we talk about a little bit about what

481
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:31,360
we're going to do what we don't want to

482
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,279
do is we don't want to surprise

483
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:35,839
any police officers or get surprised by

484
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:37,440
police officers

485
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,519
for everyone right it's not what the the

486
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:41,199
scenario you want to be in so we walk

487
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:42,720
out we walk to the stairwell we shout

488
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,079
down a couple times

489
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:45,600
are there any officers in the building

490
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,120
we're here performing a security

491
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:49,040
assessment and we hear nothing this

492
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:50,560
probably goes on for about

493
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:52,000
five to seven minutes at which point

494
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,360
we're sitting down we're waiting we're

495
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:54,880
listening for doors to open nothing ever

496
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:55,600
happens

497
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,040
we make our way downstairs and what

498
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,320
you're going to see in this clip right

499
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,199
after that

500
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:02,240
right after this is that initial initial

501
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:04,480
contact with the deputy sheriff that's

502
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:05,839
on the south side

503
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:07,440
um of the building which is the opposite

504
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:08,959
door of actually what we came in

505
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:10,320
what you don't see in the clip or

506
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,000
actually here in the clip is when we

507
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,600
come down down you'll see our hands go

508
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:14,880
up like this the sheriff

509
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,720
the deputy sheriff looks at us and i say

510
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,079
would you like us to come out or do you

511
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:18,959
want to come in

512
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:20,720
and he actually waves us out which is

513
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,720
why we come to the door open the door

514
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,399
and then we begin talking all right

515
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:27,440
let's take a look at that footage

516
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:32,240
i've got them here in the south side

517
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,399
how's it going good we just came to find

518
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:38,320
where security we work with

519
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,639
coal fire and the court system had us

520
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:42,160
they're having us test all the buildings

521
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:45,040
they're what having us

522
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,199
i saw the car out there so we thought

523
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:52,959
we'd come find you yeah to come out and

524
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:54,560
go through all the

525
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:57,440
you know yeah is this a little bit yeah

526
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:57,760
12

527
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:00,160
30. well yeah there's nobody here at 12

528
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:01,760
30 while we come here at three o'clock

529
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:02,959
when there's a bunch of people here

530
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:07,040
okay you guys got your id's with you yes

531
00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:13,839
sir

532
00:15:20,110 --> 00:15:23,190
[Music]

533
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:27,920
yeah they're good to go i heard he was

534
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:28,560
in routes

535
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,320
i think dispatch well yeah they call

536
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:32,560
checks

537
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:36,959
where's all that information it goes

538
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:41,839
sounds like you guys are good thank you

539
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:48,399
all right so what you just saw there

540
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:50,160
just in case you missed it right

541
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:52,160
is they let us go the deputy asked the

542
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,600
other w they are good are we waiting for

543
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,360
the sheriff he says no we're not waiting

544
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:56,880
for a sheriff they're good to go

545
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,480
he walks up to us and says you guys are

546
00:15:58,480 --> 00:15:59,680
good everything checks out we've talked

547
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:01,279
to your contact you guys are great

548
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:02,880
the reason that we stuck around is we

549
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,240
were actually having a really good

550
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:05,839
interaction with law enforcement

551
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:07,360
they were asking us a ton of questions

552
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:08,880
they were asking us how we did things

553
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,320
how we bypassed stuff

554
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,079
craziest stories switching area trading

555
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:13,360
war stories between law enforcement

556
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:14,079
officers and us

557
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:15,839
it was actually a lot of fun which is

558
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:17,279
why we were still sticking around there

559
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:18,320
was probably

560
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,639
nine law enforcement officers on the

561
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:22,399
steps of the courthouse it was

562
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:24,000
it ever it was really jovial we were all

563
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,759
smoking a joke and having a good time

564
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:28,160
um and then that mood suddenly switches

565
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:28,800
and it gets

566
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,519
much different real quick uh as soon as

567
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:33,279
you see the sheriff arrive body cameras

568
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:34,079
start going off

569
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:36,079
the mood dramatically changes and we

570
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:37,680
start losing a lot of profession

571
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,680
so let's take a look at debbie and

572
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:40,800
that's what you're going to see right

573
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:41,120
now

574
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:44,880
is some body cam or black drug

575
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:47,199
so their job is to walk around in a

576
00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:50,560
professional burger

577
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:53,279
this ought to be good

578
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:58,000
maybe i'd better shut my videotape off

579
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,519
all right so the sheriff has arrived on

580
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:01,120
site and this is when he decides to

581
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:04,160
wrongfully arrest us so his um

582
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:06,240
rationale behind this is that this is

583
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:08,000
the county courthouse the state doesn't

584
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:08,959
have the authority

585
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:10,720
to provide us with the authorization to

586
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,400
assess this facility

587
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,000
and because of that we were going to go

588
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,839
to jail for burglary now if you know

589
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:16,880
anything about law

590
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,959
you can't have burglary without intent

591
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:20,640
and whether or not the judicial branch

592
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,959
did have the authority to authorize us

593
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:24,880
to perform this testing

594
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,880
we they they assured us that we did and

595
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,799
we had no intent of committing a crime

596
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:29,760
we had intent of

597
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,919
executing on our engagement and facili

598
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:33,120
fulfilling the contract

599
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:34,960
according to the judicial branch's

600
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:37,039
wishes now what's also interesting about

601
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:37,360
this

602
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:39,520
is that despite all the lectures that

603
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:41,360
were given that night about this being

604
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:43,120
county property and not the state

605
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:44,640
there was actually an independent review

606
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,400
by a law firm performed at the request

607
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,679
the judicial branch

608
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:49,120
that took a look at the standing

609
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:51,919
statutes and history of case law in iowa

610
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:53,919
and what they concluded was that it is

611
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:55,360
actually likely the state

612
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:57,440
that has the sole burden of providing

613
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:00,880
security for this courthouse

614
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,720
so what we're going to do now is we're

615
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,320
going to kind of set up the slide that's

616
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:05,280
going to follow which

617
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:07,520
is actually the slide the slide of our

618
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:08,640
arrest

619
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,080
what you're going to see is you're going

620
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,679
to see the sheriff talking to a couple

621
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:12,640
of his deputies

622
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:14,480
his deputies repeatedly tell him that

623
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,640
we've been extraordinarily cooperative

624
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:19,520
and you can see he's very flustered he's

625
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:20,480
he's throwing a lot

626
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,400
out a lot of bad language saying that

627
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,000
they don't have authorization that these

628
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,520
guys really aren't professionals

629
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:26,640
and the reason that we want to point

630
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,320
this out is up until the point where the

631
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:29,280
sheriff arrives

632
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:31,440
we are treated with the utmost respect

633
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:33,120
we are seen as professionals we're seen

634
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:34,240
as doing our job

635
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:36,640
we're questioned about our job asking us

636
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:38,240
advice on how to do things

637
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:39,600
the sheriff shows up and now all of a

638
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,120
sudden like we said before that

639
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,960
mentality shifts it comes to more of a

640
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:43,919
group think

641
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:45,200
and everybody starts following the

642
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,720
sheriff's lead like well these guys

643
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,480
really aren't professionals because they

644
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,480
used a very simple tool to get in

645
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:52,480
and that obviously isn't what a

646
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:53,760
professional would do so that

647
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:55,760
that starts to change a little bit and

648
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:56,640
then of course you're going to see in

649
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:57,600
the slide you're going to see us get

650
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,120
arrested we're going to go through

651
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:01,600
uh the the entire process very quickly i

652
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:02,400
might add

653
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,840
to the very point where the sheriff kind

654
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,760
of makes fun of me outside

655
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,760
in a hallway and again for somebody who

656
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:09,360
said this wasn't personal and it wasn't

657
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:10,320
political

658
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:12,000
it looks very different when you see

659
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:25,840
when you see the actual right

660
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:39,840
let him know

661
00:19:41,050 --> 00:19:43,360
[Music]

662
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:44,640
they've been pretty cooperative so we

663
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,720
can just walk them over

664
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:48,080
they've been pretty cooperative so we

665
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:49,840
can just walk them over

666
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:52,159
okay

667
00:19:52,330 --> 00:20:04,439
[Music]

668
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:07,840
it's all you never saw been in trouble

669
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:21,840
with the law since the day they was born

670
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:39,120
[Music]

671
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:41,600
oh yeah i'll go ahead and i'll let me go

672
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:43,280
grab my pbt and i'll take him out the

673
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:46,480
hallway and all running through

674
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:59,919
so there i am sitting in a holding cell

675
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:02,320
looking at seven years of prison time

676
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:04,720
and i the sheriff comes out right after

677
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:06,080
the the clip that you saw where he's

678
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:07,360
making fun of me in the hallway and he

679
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:08,720
starts questioning me on whether or not

680
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:10,159
i was a marine asking me

681
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:13,280
uh who my ceo was where i was stationed

682
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:14,880
at some point during that conversation i

683
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,480
say hey sir are you going to actually

684
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:17,919
charge us or can you just hold us

685
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:19,679
overnight until we get this figured out

686
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:21,600
he says no no you guys are absolutely

687
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,760
100 getting charged and then he

688
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,760
realizes i believe that i actually was a

689
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:27,039
marine and says

690
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:28,720
i hate putting a good marine in jail

691
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,480
this is his comment

692
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:32,480
to me so that that annoyed me a little

693
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:34,480
bit but from that point on we're able to

694
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:35,679
actually make phone calls so i make a

695
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:37,200
phone call and i get a hold of mark

696
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:37,760
headley

697
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:38,640
and what we're going to do is we're

698
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:40,080
going to play a clip for you right now

699
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:41,840
and i want you guys to make your own

700
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:43,600
decisions here your own judgment on

701
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,120
whether or not this really sounds like

702
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:47,039
somebody who was not expecting us to do

703
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:48,400
any after hours

704
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,720
testing whatsoever so without further

705
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:51,840
ado

706
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:53,840
all phone calls are recorded and are

707
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:56,959
subject to monitoring

708
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:00,799

710
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:04,400
carol from coal fire yes

711
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,720
yeah we're in jail yeah i know i got a

712
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:07,760
call from uh

713
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:11,200
andrew and he told me about that

714
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:12,880
i okay doing anything i can't get ahold

715
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,559
of anybody from my company and this is

716
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:15,679
the first time i've been able to talk to

717
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:17,039
any of you guys

718
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:19,120
yeah well i got it i talked to andrew

719
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:21,039
and i had him and he's supposed to call

720
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:22,480
the sheriff back and talk to him but he

721
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:23,919
had a conversation with the sheriff from

722
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:25,679
the sheriff said that

723
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:26,960
they weren't budging because it was a

724
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:28,799
county building and

725
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:30,240
so there's not much i can do right now

726
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:31,840
until in the morning when i can get

727
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:32,480
somebody

728
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:35,039
to talk with the sheriff to have them

729
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:37,600
try and understand what's going on

730
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:41,039
okay so the sheriff incorrect in his

731
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:42,720
assumption or is he correct and if he is

732
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:45,440
so then why were we sent here

733
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:48,000
no he it is a county building yes he is

734
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:48,799
correct but

735
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:51,919
um the thing is is that

736
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:53,919
i figured that the sheriff would be a

737
00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:55,440
little more understanding in regards to

738
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:56,720
it

739
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,640
okay so gary's made his phone calls he

740
00:22:58,640 --> 00:22:59,919
gets through to people um

741
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:01,760
sets the wheels in motion and we spend

742
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:03,120
the rest of the night in jail so

743
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:04,720
following morning around 9 00 a.m

744
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:06,960
we're arraigned which the process as it

745
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:09,280
follows was we're handcuffed to our to

746
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:10,880
our wrists the chain goes underneath

747
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:12,320
through a belt in your waist

748
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:14,640
and then down to your your ankle cuffs

749
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:16,080
so chained up all the way and then we're

750
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:17,520
strung together and we are paraded

751
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:19,600
across the street in downtown adl

752
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,120
to the courthouse that we've just broken

753
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:23,360
into early that morning

754
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:25,360
uh gary's first up on the docket so when

755
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:27,039
he goes in front of the judge

756
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:29,760
i start explaining immediately she says

757
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:30,480
uh

758
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:31,840
first first they ask you know what's

759
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:33,120
your name where do you work how much

760
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:33,919
money do you make and

761
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:36,640
basically to see if you qualify for um a

762
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:38,240
public defender when you realize that we

763
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:38,880
didn't

764
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:41,200
qualify for a public defender she looks

765
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:44,000
down at her docket and sees what i did

766
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,120
and she is instantly enraged you broke

767
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:48,799
into this courthouse

768
00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:51,120
into my courtroom and just starts

769
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:52,400
berating me right there

770
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,840
when i finally do have a chance to speak

771
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:55,039
i explained to her i said man this is

772
00:23:55,039 --> 00:23:56,320
just a big misunderstanding

773
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:58,000
i work for a cyber security company

774
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,919
called coal fire we were actually

775
00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:01,679
contracted by the state to come in here

776
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:02,320
and do

777
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:04,159
a physical security assessment of this

778
00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:05,520
building and she

779
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:07,919
halts me immediately says you must think

780
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:09,679
i fell off the turnip truck i must be

781
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:12,320
the dumbest person alive etc etc etc

782
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:14,480
i'm just telling you how wrong i was and

783
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:15,520
if any testing

784
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:17,279
of of the sort was going to be done like

785
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:18,960
that they would have let her now

786
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:20,720
out of the 5 000 judges in the state

787
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,240
they would have called her specifically

788
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:22,720
and said

789
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:24,080
hey miss judge they're going to come to

790
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:25,200
your courthouse and they're going to do

791
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,880
this while you're not there after hours

792
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,000
you have nothing to do with security of

793
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,520
the building but that's the way that

794
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:30,640
that is so

795
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:32,640
i get berated by the judge and the whole

796
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:33,840
time

797
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:35,760
i am thinking this is insane i can't

798
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:36,960
believe that the judge

799
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:39,279
would would not at least listen to what

800
00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:40,159
i'm saying

801
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:42,080
at some point she lets me talk again and

802
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:44,080
i look over and i say man because

803
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:45,440
if you're the judge the sheriff is

804
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:47,440
sitting right here in a bench with a

805
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:48,400
gentleman next

806
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,960
and i say ma'am the sheriff verified

807
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:51,679
that we were

808
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:53,360
sent by the state last night his

809
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:54,880
deputies had let us go and they had

810
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,240
verified that we were working under

811
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:57,919
contract from the state

812
00:24:57,919 --> 00:24:59,600
and i look over at the sheriff expecting

813
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,440
him to say something and he's just

814
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:03,120
sitting back like this with a big grin

815
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:05,919
on his face and doesn't say a word which

816
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:07,440
infuriated me like you would not

817
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:09,520
understand so again she says you must

818
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:10,880
think i'm dumb you need to change your

819
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,080
story etc etc

820
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:14,000
and so at which point the gentleman next

821
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,520
to the sheriff stands up and i'm

822
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:16,080
thinking

823
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:17,760
because we had never actually met our

824
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:19,360
contacts in person

825
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:21,279
this must be the gentleman from the

826
00:25:21,279 --> 00:25:22,799
state he's going to set all of this

827
00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:23,440
straight

828
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:26,240
gentleman comes in sits down or stands

829
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:27,200
next to me

830
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:29,039
and looks at the judge and says man

831
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:30,640
these people are a flight risk i want

832
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:32,400
you to increase their bail

833
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:34,640
uh they shouldn't be allowed to leave

834
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:37,200
and so now my heart just sinks because i

835
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,799
thought for sure this was going to be

836
00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:40,480
our client coming here explaining the

837
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:40,960
fact

838
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:42,960
that this is a big misunderstanding the

839
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,799
judge apparently completely agrees with

840
00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:46,400
him and changes our bail from seven

841
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:47,679
thousand dollars each

842
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:50,799
to fifty thousand dollars so to give you

843
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:51,600
a kind of an

844
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:53,760
idea of what a big jump that is in case

845
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,120
you don't know

846
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:56,799
recently in the news there was a

847
00:25:56,799 --> 00:25:58,559
shooting in seattle

848
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:00,640
in the middle of the street two of the

849
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:01,600
two of the people that

850
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,200
got trouble for the shooting actually

851
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:06,080
fled to vegas were captured in vegas

852
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:08,320
and their bail was said can you guess

853
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:10,320
that's right fifty thousand dollars for

854
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:11,840
murder

855
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:14,799
fair i don't know you decide um so after

856
00:26:14,799 --> 00:26:15,520
that point

857
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:17,520
i i see what gary's gone through i'm

858
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:19,120
next online and once i go up

859
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:21,440
i kind of spell the same story and say

860
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:22,960
same result and outcome

861
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:24,640
uh bail has increased to fifty thousand

862
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,960
dollars so up from our original seven

863
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,799
thousand now collectively we're facing a

864
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:30,400
hundred thousand dollars and

865
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:33,279
bond um at which point we're walked back

866
00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:35,120
to the to the jail um

867
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:36,640
up until that point coal fired been

868
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:38,000
trying to work with the state trying to

869
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,919
get them to go down and represent us or

870
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:40,480
at least

871
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:42,480
vouch for us which had not happened at

872
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:43,520
this point we found out they had

873
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:44,480
lawyered up

874
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:47,600
um so same deal early that morning one

875
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:48,799
one of the guys one of our point of

876
00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:49,679
contacts had

877
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:51,760
uploaded a signed contract to the portal

878
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:52,960
it's something we don't normally sign

879
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:54,799
but they wanted our signature on that as

880
00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:55,360
well

881
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:56,480
and that's the document they were going

882
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:58,640
to provide to the county sheriff to say

883
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:00,240
look guys this is all a huge

884
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:02,000
misunderstanding these guys are working

885
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,520
for the state

886
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:05,760
at which point i think they realize they

887
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:06,720
were facing

888
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,480
backlash from the county so it's very

889
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:10,080
clear that the county wanted to attack

890
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:10,880
the state

891
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:13,279
over the altercation that had occurred

892
00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:14,880
and they subsequently removed that

893
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:16,240
document from our

894
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:18,080
portal which we call coal fire one have

895
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:20,320
all those time stamps um so at that

896
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:22,080
point we're back in the jail cells

897
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:23,679
um and now coal fire is working on

898
00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:25,679
actually paying for for our bail and

899
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:27,440
posting bail for us so we can get out as

900
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:28,880
it's very clear that the sheriff isn't

901
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:29,760
going to let us go

902
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:31,200
and judicial branch is coming to the

903
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,440
rescue so we're in jail for

904
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:35,200
another 12 hours after that point for a

905
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:36,720
total of about 20 hours

906
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,799
we end up getting let go late that night

907
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:39,840
around 9 00 pm

908
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:42,480
um after coal fire was able to postpone

909
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:42,960
okay

910
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:44,880
so throughout this entire process we're

911
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,880
also having to remain cognizant of polk

912
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:48,720
county we were inside that courthouse if

913
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:50,080
we were arrested inside the dallas

914
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:51,120
county courthouse

915
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:53,279
it stands to reason that those sheriffs

916
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:55,039
that that county could have also pressed

917
00:27:55,039 --> 00:27:55,919
charges against

918
00:27:55,919 --> 00:27:58,159
us fortunately for us um they were a

919
00:27:58,159 --> 00:27:59,679
little bit more cautious about things

920
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:01,120
they decided to feel it out get all the

921
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:02,559
facts of the case first before they

922
00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:04,240
decided to press charges

923
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:06,399
um throughout part of that process they

924
00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:07,440
they did want to

925
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:09,679
um give us immunity if they decided to

926
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:11,520
go against the state they they asked us

927
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:12,799
hey we'll give you a plea deal if you

928
00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:14,240
guys want full immunity

929
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:16,559
testify against the state and we said

930
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:18,799
guys we're not guilty whatsoever we have

931
00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:19,840
no problems

932
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:21,279
with any of this we have all the

933
00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:22,960
contracts and documentation in the world

934
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:24,320
to back us up whereas

935
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:26,480
some other poor folks at the um

936
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:28,000
discretion of the state might be

937
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,440
run through the legal system and not

938
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:31,360
have all the resources that we have

939
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:33,120
but we know we're innocent and we have

940
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:34,559
all the documentation in the world to

941
00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:35,520
prove it so we said

942
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:37,360
no we don't want any plea deals we don't

943
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:38,640
want immunity from you

944
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:40,080
if anyone wants us to come in and

945
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:42,399
testify and give the facts of the story

946
00:28:42,399 --> 00:28:44,240
we are absolutely willing to do so but

947
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:45,440
it's not going to be to save our own

948
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:46,640
skins because we did

949
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:49,600
absolutely nothing wrong so at this

950
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:51,200
point the da is involved

951
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:53,279
and the da is basically saying

952
00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:54,799
somebody's head is going to roll

953
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:57,039
i don't care who it is but somebody

954
00:28:57,039 --> 00:28:59,039
needs to be held responsible for this

955
00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:01,200
so this all kind of goes away he kind of

956
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:02,640
pushes it towards the lead prosecutor

957
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,399
for the county of for polk county

958
00:29:04,399 --> 00:29:06,720
who actually is a pretty good guy he

959
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:07,520
looks at

960
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:09,760
all the evidence he looks at the uh the

961
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:10,960
detectives that are doing all the

962
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:12,799
investigation and says

963
00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:15,120
justin gary are not guilty they didn't

964
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:17,120
do anything wrong he says there's no way

965
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:19,039
they are they they were burglarizing

966
00:29:19,039 --> 00:29:19,679
anything

967
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:21,520
and even trespassing would be an

968
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:22,880
absolute hail mary

969
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:24,720
that i don't think we would absolutely

970
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:26,000
or we would we would win

971
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,240
in any court um so good on him for

972
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:29,840
taking the time and actually saying that

973
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:31,440
and he actually comes to a point

974
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:32,799
later on down the road where he tells

975
00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:34,720
the d.a he says look if you want to

976
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:36,320
charge these guys you're going to have

977
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:37,600
to find somebody else

978
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:39,279
because i ethically and in good

979
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:41,600
conscience cannot charge them because i

980
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:43,520
don't think they are guilty of anything

981
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:44,000
so

982
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,880
huge thumbs up to the polk county uh the

983
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,559
polk county attorney thank you so much

984
00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:49,200
for

985
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:51,279
at least having the wherewithal and the

986
00:29:51,279 --> 00:29:52,320
common sense to

987
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:54,000
do your due diligence and investigate

988
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,360
everything before you made

989
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:58,080
um made your decisions so a couple other

990
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:00,080
things that happened during this process

991
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:02,080
is we had some threats from the sheriff

992
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:03,520
of polk county too because

993
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:06,240
our ceo tom had released a couple of

994
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:07,520
statements that you might be familiar

995
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:08,000
with that

996
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,720
weren't didn't paint the sheriff of

997
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:12,240
dallas county in the best light

998
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:14,799
um that made the other sheriffs angry

999
00:30:14,799 --> 00:30:16,799
and uh he threatened us and said if we

1000
00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:18,320
release any more or if coal fire

1001
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:20,240
releases any more statements like that

1002
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:22,960
or says anything negative about any

1003
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:24,320
other sheriff's especially the dallas

1004
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:25,039
county sheriff

1005
00:30:25,039 --> 00:30:26,240
that they were going to come at us they

1006
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:27,279
were going to take the gloves off and

1007
00:30:27,279 --> 00:30:28,720
they were going to come and punch it

1008
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:31,360
uh we had that that happened as well um

1009
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:32,880
later on through this and again we're

1010
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:34,720
truncating something that took over six

1011
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:36,000
months all down to this like

1012
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,760
little like two minute little spiel that

1013
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:40,320
we can go into um

1014
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:43,520
at some point um supreme justice

1015
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:45,760
katie comes in our chief justice katie

1016
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:51,100
comes in

1017
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:57,539
[Music]

1018
00:30:58,559 --> 00:31:00,880
non-felonious misconduct while in office

1019
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:02,159
against against

1020
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:04,000
the people who hired us for the state

1021
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,519
are actual contacts that we're working

1022
00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:06,799
with for the state

1023
00:31:06,799 --> 00:31:08,240
something gets delayed that's actually

1024
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:10,159
supposed to happen on the friday after

1025
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:11,200
we gave

1026
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:13,840
our um after we gave our testimony it

1027
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:15,120
was supposed to happen on that friday

1028
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:16,559
something happens the paper

1029
00:31:16,559 --> 00:31:19,200
paperwork gets delayed to the next week

1030
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:20,960
and in between the time that we give our

1031
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:22,399
testimony and the time that that's

1032
00:31:22,399 --> 00:31:24,640
actually supposed to happen

1033
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:27,440
chief justice katie dies like straight

1034
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:29,519
out of a movie the gentleman dies before

1035
00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:30,480
anything can happen

1036
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:32,559
and right at the cusp of us being

1037
00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:34,000
completely vindicated through this

1038
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,360
entire scenario

1039
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:38,479
chief justice katie dies

1040
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:46,159
and everything dies with you just

1041
00:31:46,159 --> 00:31:48,080
all right so at the end of this lengthy

1042
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:49,600
legal process we have some personal

1043
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:50,480
repercussions

1044
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:52,240
uh at this point now we have permanent

1045
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:54,399
felony arrest records anytime we're

1046
00:31:54,399 --> 00:31:56,080
picked up on the job assessing a

1047
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:57,919
facility if police show up and respond

1048
00:31:57,919 --> 00:31:59,120
to our presence there

1049
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:01,760
we provide credentials and our letter of

1050
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:03,440
authorization they may totally buy our

1051
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:05,039
story and be in agreement with us until

1052
00:32:05,039 --> 00:32:05,440
they

1053
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:07,120
run our credentials which comes back

1054
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:08,559
spelling arrest records

1055
00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:10,399
i'm going to be severely detrimental for

1056
00:32:10,399 --> 00:32:12,159
us to ever try to perform these types of

1057
00:32:12,159 --> 00:32:12,799
engagements

1058
00:32:12,799 --> 00:32:14,640
future there's a lot of stuff we need to

1059
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:15,919
undergo for um

1060
00:32:15,919 --> 00:32:17,360
certain departments within the united

1061
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:18,480
states or we're trying to pass a

1062
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:19,600
security clearance

1063
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:21,440
very unlikely we'll be able to do so now

1064
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:23,120
with felony arrest records

1065
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:25,200
uh we have our personal gear which we

1066
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:27,120
bring on on site we supply all that

1067
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:27,760
ourselves

1068
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:29,200
that was held by dallas county for

1069
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:31,360
approximately six months which had other

1070
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:33,039
repercussions we were unable to perform

1071
00:32:33,039 --> 00:32:34,080
other engagements

1072
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:35,760
we're advised not to leave the country

1073
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:37,120
we had to give up on speaking

1074
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:39,440
engagements in belgium and new york city

1075
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:41,600
and mexico as a result of all of this

1076
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:42,880
we are also stripped of our second

1077
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:44,720
amendment rights so even for

1078
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:46,480
months after after felony charges has

1079
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:48,320
been dropped went to misdemeanors and we

1080
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:50,159
shouldn't be able to acquire firearms

1081
00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:52,799
we still got status pending by the atf

1082
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:53,279
we're

1083
00:32:53,279 --> 00:32:54,880
unable to exercise our second amendment

1084
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:56,880
rights even after charges were dropped

1085
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:58,640
entirely still had to wait some months

1086
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:01,279
until those background checks were clear

1087
00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:03,440
and the people as much as we would like

1088
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:04,640
to cry about ourselves

1089
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:07,039
right who for us the people are actually

1090
00:33:07,039 --> 00:33:08,320
getting screwed here are the citizens of

1091
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:08,880
iowa

1092
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:12,159
you have you have a law firm

1093
00:33:12,159 --> 00:33:15,840
and politicians now that have made law

1094
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:19,120
and passed policies within the state

1095
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:22,320
that are more concerned with liability

1096
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:25,840
and zero concern on actual security and

1097
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:27,760
as much as we would like to share all of

1098
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:29,120
the things that we found it would be

1099
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:30,480
irresponsible not

1100
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:32,960
unethical for us to do so but needless

1101
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:33,760
to say

1102
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:36,720
there is a plethora of things within

1103
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:37,679
iowa state

1104
00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:40,399
that need to be fixed and they affect

1105
00:33:40,399 --> 00:33:40,880
each

1106
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:43,919
person there significantly and that's

1107
00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:45,039
not going to happen now because

1108
00:33:45,039 --> 00:33:45,919
basically all

1109
00:33:45,919 --> 00:33:48,640
offensive security whatsoever has been

1110
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:49,120
axed

1111
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:51,039
in the state of iowa and that is the

1112
00:33:51,039 --> 00:33:52,320
real the real

1113
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:55,039
crux of this issue and what what really

1114
00:33:55,039 --> 00:33:56,880
kind of chaps our high to security

1115
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:57,919
professionals right

1116
00:33:57,919 --> 00:33:59,600
every one of us are kind of like you

1117
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:01,120
know the good guy riding in by the horse

1118
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:01,840
to save the day

1119
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:04,640
like i think all of us kind of see

1120
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:06,559
ourselves as that is trying to help

1121
00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:07,840
other people right we're

1122
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:09,839
we're as as much as we like to do the

1123
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:12,159
you know the whole the whole hacker idea

1124
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:13,199
in our mind is

1125
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:14,800
i think everybody in the cyber security

1126
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:16,719
is very altruistic like we want to help

1127
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:17,199
people

1128
00:34:17,199 --> 00:34:18,560
we want to make things better and we

1129
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:20,399
want to protect them and that is

1130
00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:22,320
the exact opposite of what happened in

1131
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:24,159
this entire scenario

1132
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:25,760
and that and that's the real loser in

1133
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:28,000
this whole thing is the citizens of iowa

1134
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,800
so um the last thing that we want to

1135
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,079
bring up is

1136
00:34:32,079 --> 00:34:34,320
is us actually having all charges

1137
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:35,359
dropped

1138
00:34:35,359 --> 00:34:38,000
we had one final shot across our bow

1139
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,839
right before our charges were dropped

1140
00:34:39,839 --> 00:34:42,879
and that was sheriff leonard coming to

1141
00:34:42,879 --> 00:34:43,280
us

1142
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:45,760
and saying if i don't get to talk to the

1143
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:47,280
ceo of coal fire

1144
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:49,520
i'm not dropping charges i'm going to

1145
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:50,960
press charges with this and we're going

1146
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:52,079
to go forward

1147
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:53,760
through your through your hearing as far

1148
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:55,839
as as seeing if there was enough

1149
00:34:55,839 --> 00:34:58,960
if there was enough information or

1150
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:00,320
whatever it is that they look for

1151
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:02,400
right to make sure that we can actually

1152
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:03,760
take him to trial

1153
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:05,359
he holds us hostage and says i'm not

1154
00:35:05,359 --> 00:35:06,960
dropping any charges until i get to talk

1155
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:08,800
to your ceo luckily our ceo tom is a

1156
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:09,839
great guy and he says

1157
00:35:09,839 --> 00:35:11,040
dude that's not a problem whatever

1158
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:12,960
whatever helps you guys out

1159
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:14,720
but you have the same sheriff that set

1160
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:16,240
up an awareness con

1161
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:18,480
saying that it's not up to me i'm not

1162
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:20,320
the one that makes these decisions

1163
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:21,920
i'm not the one that's going to do all

1164
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:23,440
of this this is all probably vegan

1165
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:24,480
misunderstanding

1166
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:26,079
i hope all of this fleshes out in the

1167
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:28,160
end and when it came time

1168
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:30,960
as as deviant's so eloquently put it

1169
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:33,119
took time for him to either take action

1170
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:35,599
or tweet and take a choice between which

1171
00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:37,119
one of those it was

1172
00:35:37,119 --> 00:35:39,359
he chose to hold us hostage and say i

1173
00:35:39,359 --> 00:35:40,960
refuse to drop charges

1174
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:44,480
unless i get my way we have a video next

1175
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:46,240

1176
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:47,280
they could actually drop

1177
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:49,359
charges uh if they waited any longer our

1178
00:35:49,359 --> 00:35:50,640
emotion dismissed would have gone

1179
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:52,240
through we would appear in court and

1180
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:53,599
hopefully have things dropped

1181
00:35:53,599 --> 00:35:55,680
however the last final moment we

1182
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:57,359
actually have on video which we're about

we're actually looking for some help

passed so this doesn't happen to anybody

1240

else

1241
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:18,720
we have seen firsthand what happens when

1242
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:20,480
a client decides to go rogue

1243
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:22,720
and completely disavow somebody most

1244
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:24,400
importantly we never want this to happen

1245
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:24,960

00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:26,960
