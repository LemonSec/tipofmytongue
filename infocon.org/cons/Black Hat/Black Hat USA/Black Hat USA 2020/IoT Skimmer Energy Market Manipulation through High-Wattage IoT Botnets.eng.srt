iot skimmer the energy market

5
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:24,000
manipulation through high wattage iot

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,519
botnets let me start with the iot

7
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:29,279
skimmer team

8
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:32,399
a very group of researchers in the

9
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:34,719
communication assurance and performance

10
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:35,200
group

11
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:38,559
at georgia tech uh i am toy chiakari a

12
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:39,920
phd candidate

13
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:42,719
and my lab mate selena rin who helped me

14
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:44,960
in data analysis and collection

15
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:47,520
and we both are advised by the director

16
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:48,719
of the lab

17
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:53,199
and also our phd advisor dr beta

18
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:55,360
let's start with the brief background on

19
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:57,039
the power grid structure

20
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:00,239
generally every power grid has three

21
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:02,000
main sectors

22
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,040
generation transmission and distribution

23
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:08,080
in the generation section

24
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:10,799
the major portion of the required energy

25
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:12,000
by the customers

26
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,439
is generated by big producers such as

27
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:16,960
nuclear power plants

28
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:20,080
or wind farms solar farms hydraulic

29
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,439
power

30
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:24,560
then the generated power is transmitted

31
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,000
over long distances

32
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,159
using transmission lines or the

33
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:30,560
transmission sector

34
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:34,880
and then when it nears the customers the

35
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:38,320
the voltage is stepped down and

36
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,960
it the energy is distributed among the

37
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,399
end users with

38
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:44,960
distribution lines or in the

39
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,880
distribution sector

40
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:49,680
at the end of this chain we have the

41
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:50,640
commercial

42
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:53,680
or industrial users and also we have the

43
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:54,560
residential

44
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:57,200
customers

45
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:01,119
like any other industrial control system

46
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:04,320
power grid has its own specific

47
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:08,560
and proprietary communication

48
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:12,560
network and also the control algorithms

49
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:15,200
for the communication network that is

50
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,480
responsible for

51
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,720
collecting the measurements throughout

52
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:19,920
the power grid

53
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,080
to make them available for the

54
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,200
monitoring

55
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,200
and decision making purposes in the

56
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,720
control center

57
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:29,840
uh we have a system called supervisory

58
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:32,239
controlled and data acquisition system

59
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:35,920
or scada system and this system is

60
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,440
responsible to collect

61
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,200
different measurements throughout the

62
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,120
power grid from different

63
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:44,480
uh substations and power plants

64
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:47,840
and the raw data then

65
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:51,040
it is they're communicating they're

66
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,360
sent back to the control center they are

67
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,879
being monitored by the

68
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:57,680
human operators and they have automated

69
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:00,879
the manual tools to process the raw data

70
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:04,159
and make controlled decisions on the

71
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:07,040
process data then they send back the

72
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,720
decisions to the

73
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:11,200
to the substations and also the power

74
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,159
plants

75
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:14,480
and the decisions could be switching a

76
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,400
specific power line

77
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:19,519
or even changing the output power

78
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:23,599
generation of a specific generation or a

79
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:26,959
specific power plant

80
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:31,200
with the explosion of the high

81
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,159
performance

82
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:35,360
computing devices and also with the

83
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,239
emergence

84
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:39,920
and explosion of measurement devices in

85
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,599
the power grid

86
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:44,720
uh the concept of the power grid has

87
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,640
changed a lot

88
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:49,200
for example the term of smart grid has

89
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,840
been introduced in recent years

90
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:55,840
which includes the high penetration of

91
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,519
the computing devices

92
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:02,560
and also the measurement devices and

93
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:05,519
we don't have this vertical structure

94
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:06,720
that i mentioned

95
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:09,519
in the previous slide anymore in this

96
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:12,080
new environment

97
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:15,680
the power generation can be

98
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:18,720
partly done in the customer side

99
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,918
and also in the generation side and also

100
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:24,080
we have a much more efficient system

101
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:27,520
in terms of energy consumption and this

102
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:30,800
new smart grid concept provides provided

103
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:31,120
us

104
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:34,639
with cheaper energy

105
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:39,600
now let's talk about electricity market

106
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,639
traditionally

107
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:43,120
everything from the generation

108
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,160
transmission

109
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:47,040
to the end users and the distribution

110
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:47,759
systems

111
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:50,479
were owned by the government-owned

112
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:51,840
parties

113
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:55,680
but in late 1990s the concept of

114
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:58,720
power system was introduced

115
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:04,639
the basic concept was to moving from the

116
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:07,680
government-owned entities to private

117
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:08,240
owned

118
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:11,600
and competitive environment

119
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,160
in this new environment the generation

120
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:14,960
companies

121
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:17,280
and the retailers can participate in the

122
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,720
market

123
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:22,840
and offer their

124
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:25,759
prices and this is a competitive

125
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:26,560
environment

126
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:30,080
which provides us with the with better

127
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,039
prices

128
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:34,720
and also the energy efficiency

129
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:38,639
and according to the

130
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:41,520
united states statistics in the year

131
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:42,560
2018

132
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,639
the total transactions on the

133
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:46,880
electricity markets in the us

134
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:50,240
were more than 168 billion dollars

135
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:53,840
so we have a gen we have a structure

136
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:55,840
similar to this in the electricity

137
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:58,319
market we have some generators we have

138
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:01,919
we have big retailers or resellers

139
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:05,280
and these two part

140
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,759
these two group of players they submit

141
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:08,720
their

142
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,120
bids to the market saying that i'm gonna

143
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:14,319
buy this much of energy for this price

144
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:16,880
i'm i'm going to and the other player is

145
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:17,680
going to say

146
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:20,880
i'm going to sell this much of energy

147
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,960
for this price the market operator

148
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:25,039
clears the market

149
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:28,560
and the price is determined

150
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:31,280
so it's a totally free market and the

151
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:34,080
retailers are responsible for part of

152
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,960
participating in the volatile daily

153
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,240
market

154
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,800
but they're offering usually the fixed

155
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,720
rate to the end users

156
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:46,000
and this makes their work very

157
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,680
very challenging indeed they can't

158
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:52,000
offer very low prices because they may

159
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,759
lose in the market and they can't

160
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:55,919
offer very high prices because they will

161
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:59,120
lose customers

162
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:01,680
this system has been implemented in a

163
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,919
lot of regions around the world

164
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:06,319
the entire system hasn't been

165
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:07,280
transformed

166
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:11,440
into the structured system we still have

167
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:14,080
the traditional structure in some parts

168
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,360
of the board

169
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:18,319
but the most of the power grid in most

170
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:20,720
of the countries have been transformed

171
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:21,919
into the

172
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:23,919
into the new structure for example in

173
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:25,120
the u.s

174
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,919
we have nine different regions that the

175
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:29,759
restructure power grid or the

176
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:32,800
electricity markets have been developed

177
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,880
and two of the biggest ones of course

178
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:37,360
are california market and the new york

179
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,800
market

180
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,440
and each of these markets has two

181
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,639
sub-markets

182
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:45,840
and the day ahead and real time

183
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,879
in the day ahead market uh

184
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:52,400
so the the players participate in this

185
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,120
market

186
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:56,319
one day before the actual operation

187
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:58,639
and they're making bids offers for the

188
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:00,800
next day so they're doing this based on

189
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,720
the load forecasting

190
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,160
the thing is that based on the

191
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,800
historical data the market players can

192
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:07,919
make

193
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:10,319
predictions on the loads for the next

194
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:12,800
day to some extent with a certain

195
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,120
amount of error for example five to ten

196
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,039
percent

197
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:19,280
but there's usually a load forecasting

198
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,560
errors

199
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:24,000
and also there are also unpredictable

200
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,759
events such as the outage of the

201
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:27,919
generators or

202
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:31,520
even outage of a specific transmission

203
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:32,000
line

204
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,360
which might affect the prices

205
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:38,799
so in real time market to

206
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:41,279
to compensate this mismatch between the

207
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:42,320
generation

208
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:45,680
and consumption which happened in real

209
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,839
time because we can't entirely control

210
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:50,560
the load in real time

211
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,959
there is a real-time market again the

212
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:54,000
players submit their

213
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,040
bids the prices might be higher or lower

214
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:00,080
it's more volatile than the day ahead

215
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,440
market

216
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:04,000
uh but it's not the existence is

217
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,200
necessary to make the real-time

218
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:10,800
load balance generation

219
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:17,519
now let's move to the iot botnets

220
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:20,000
iot botanists have been recently

221
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,160
introduced in the into the cyber

222
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,440
security domain

223
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:26,399
the most famous one was mirai botnet

224
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:30,000
which was discovered in august 2016.

225
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,680
and it included over 600 000 compromise

226
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:34,959
devices

227
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:38,480
and it was used indirectly to attack

228
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:41,839
other domains which even properly

229
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:44,720
secured uh such as the brian krebs

230
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:45,360
website

231
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:48,640
was a cyber security journalist also it

232
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,240
was used in another

233
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,480
set of distributed denial of service

234
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:53,760
attacks

235
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,320
uh but after the release of the source

236
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,920
code of the spotlight

237
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:01,040
the the similar botanists have emerged

238
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:04,000
such as lawabad ajima

239
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,839
and they're distributed all over the

240
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:07,600
world so we're going to even hear

241
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,839
more about the iit botanist in the

242
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:11,120
future

243
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:13,120
and this figure shows the geographical

244
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,240
distribution of

245
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:19,519
this market of this partner

246
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:21,440
but for the attack as far as for the

247
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,519
attacks on the financial markets

248
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:25,440
uh there's been a lot of market

249
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,680
manipulation cases

250
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:30,720
uh which can be defined as a deliberate

251
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,000
and malicious interference

252
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,680
with the market values to create an

253
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:36,640
artificial price for a tradable entity

254
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,720
usually distributed denial of service

255
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,720
attacks

256
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:44,399
were launched on to to interrupt these

257
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:45,120
markets

258
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:48,480
and target their availability two of the

259
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,800
most famous ones i've mentioned in this

260
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:53,040
slide

261
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:55,360
attacks on the electricity markets there

262
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,880
has been always

263
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:59,440
market manipulation cases in electricity

264
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,279
markets but we have no

265
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:04,399
proof or evidence of the existence of

266
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:05,760
any significant

267
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:08,560
cyber attack on the on the electricity

268
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,959
market for example in the u.s federal

269
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:14,079
energy regulatory commission

270
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:16,000
reported 16 potential market

271
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,040
manipulation cases to in 2018 and 14 of

272
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:20,800
which were closed

273
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:24,079
with no action but most recently in the

274
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:25,760
past couple of months

275
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:29,600
eucalyptus uk electricity market

276
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,760
experienced the major cyber attack and

277
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,680
you can read the

278
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:38,079
detailed article here so it started to

279
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:43,120
heat up this this specific field

280
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,600
iot botnet attacks on the power grid

281
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:46,560
have been

282
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,720
emerging and studied recently it was

283
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:49,680
introduced by

284
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,760
sultan and his colleagues in princeton

285
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,760
university and the title of the paper

286
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:56,079
was black iot it was presented in using

287
00:11:56,079 --> 00:11:58,079
security 2018

288
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:01,040
the basic idea was that as an attacker

289
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:03,200
you have access to a high wattage iot

290
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,160
botnet

291
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:08,399
whose bots are you consuming high water

292
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:12,399
high watts and they can consume high

293
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:14,720
energy such as hvac systems

294
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:18,160
water heater air conditioner

295
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,160
and it was mentioned in the paper that

296
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,839
if the attacker

297
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:25,440
can simultaneously

298
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:29,440
turn on or off these devices uh

299
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,920
during specific times you can cause

300
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:32,880
blackout

301
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:36,000
uh in the system by giving it a shock

302
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,519
a big shock then one year later

303
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:43,279
a other group of researchers came in and

304
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:46,240
they shown that not it's not as dark as

305
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:49,040
it was shown in the first paper

306
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:52,800
um but because the protection schemes

307
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,639
the underlying protection schemes of the

308
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:56,639
power grid they can withstand against

309
00:12:56,639 --> 00:13:00,480
those attacks to some extent

310
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:03,680
now let's move to our paper our

311
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:08,800
presentation and see what we have done

312
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:11,200
to do so let's talk about the threat

313
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:11,839
model

314
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:14,000
so we want to do the market manipulation

315
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,639
in electricity market but how

316
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:19,360
can we manipulate the prices if you

317
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,000
remember

318
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,399
this scene this is a from famous movie

319
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:24,480
called wolf of walla street

320
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:27,279
this guy jordan belfort was one of the

321
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:29,519
biggest scammers in the stock market of

322
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:30,480
the us

323
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:33,600
he used to manipulate the market prices

324
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:37,120
and used the new prices and manipulated

325
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:40,160
the prices in his own favor

326
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:43,360
for example he was buying a stock in low

327
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:46,079
price and then selling he was selling

328
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:46,800
the same

329
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:51,440
stock after a huge uh manipulated

330
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:54,560
pump in the stock he for example he

331
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:56,560
he could buy stock when the price was

332
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:58,240
two dollars and he could sell it when

333
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,040
the price was

334
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:02,000
three dollars and also he also used the

335
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,040
concept of

336
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:06,800
short selling basically he uh

337
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:10,000
he borrowed the stock from the broker he

338
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,399
sold it at the high price then he dumped

339
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:13,199
the price

340
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:16,320
and he he built again the same

341
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:19,120
stock and give them back to the broker

342
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,320
itself

343
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:22,320
with a lower price so he could make

344
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,920
money in this way as well but

345
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:26,240
can we do a similar thing in electricity

346
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,240
market

347
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:31,760
by studying the the data of the

348
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:34,079
electricity markets we notice that the

349
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:36,639
system demand change in real time or the

350
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:37,279
load

351
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:41,199
forecasting error can affect electricity

352
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:43,839
market prices so if we can somehow

353
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:44,560
control

354
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:47,440
the total power consumption of the power

355
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,560
grid and change it

356
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:52,160
slightly uh we should be able to affect

357
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:54,160
the real-time system

358
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:58,399
uh electricity market prices

359
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:01,120
so if the attacker has access to a high

360
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:04,639
wattage iot botnet

361
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:07,040
we can manipulate the profits of

362
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,560
different players

363
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:10,639
and in this way we can have two

364
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:12,639
different attacker types attacker type

365
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:13,760
one two

366
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,760
mark attacker type one is a market

367
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:18,000
player whose goal is to maximize his own

368
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,760
profit and the second one is a nation

369
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:20,720
state actor

370
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:24,720
which is a part of trade or cold war to

371
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:27,440
uh to damage the other players

372
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:28,639
financially

373
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:31,920
or the entire market

374
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:34,320
but that hacker needs market historical

375
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,240
and real-time data

376
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:38,560
to estimate the key parameters such as

377
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:40,800
the price load sensitivity

378
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,920
system real-time demand and d-hit prices

379
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,920
and one more key point is that the

380
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:48,320
attacker needs to optimize the attack to

381
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,880
maximize the gain and

382
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:55,279
damage on the system

383
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:58,240
so we have two attacker types and

384
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,839
optimization problems would be

385
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:02,560
maximizing the profit of the market

386
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:04,160
player in the first

387
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:06,079
attack type and the constraints are

388
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:08,079
technical due to the market

389
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:11,600
player market rules and the stealth

390
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:14,160
strategies the second one is to maximize

391
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:16,079
the economic damage on the market

392
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:18,000
entire market and the constraints of

393
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,279
market rules and stealth strategies

394
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:23,279
but let's talk about the feasibility of

395
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:25,040
attack

396
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:28,399
uh from the iowa department perspective

397
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:30,880
a successful attack we noticed that it

398
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:33,360
can be done with as low as 50 000

399
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:36,320
baht of course the more you bots you

400
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:38,079
have the more damage or your

401
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:41,920
more profit you can make from the market

402
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:45,120
but the lower number of bus doesn't

403
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:48,320
uh jeopardize the general structure of

404
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,120
the tank

405
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:52,160
and also you can build and rent a decent

406
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:53,040
botnet

407
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:55,680
uh such a botnet with almost four

408
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:58,079
thousand dollars per month

409
00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:00,639
uh but this is even not comparable to

410
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:02,480
the attacking because you can gain

411
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,959
millions of dollars per day with such

412
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:07,280
market manipulation

413
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:09,439
but the key point is that your bots

414
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:12,319
should be high wattage

415
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:14,640
but do we have such number of high

416
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,959
wattage devices

417
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:20,480
for example in the us uh and

418
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:23,199
this right hand side figure shows the

419
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:24,720
total number of the

420
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:27,439
smart thermostats in the north america

421
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:30,160
region and as we can see there are over

422
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:33,280
30 million devices

423
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:35,520
like this in the north america region in

424
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:36,799
2020

425
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:39,039
and this makes it feasible because this

426
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:41,360
is just one of the devices available

427
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:42,880
device imagine that we have

428
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:45,039
hundreds of such devices in the

429
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:46,480
environment and if we

430
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:49,840
if even with if we are able to

431
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:51,440
compromise

432
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:54,320
less than one percent of those devices

433
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:54,960
we should

434
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:59,039
have a very very big partner

435
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:02,240
and also this uh table shows the

436
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:04,880
available botnet rental services

437
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:08,880
and as you can see there are a lot of

438
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:11,120
services for renting it's like different

439
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:12,880
partner size with different

440
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:15,600
rental costs with different duration and

441
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:16,160
why not

442
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:20,400
one note one thing to note here is that

443
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:23,600
these are not necessarily high wattage

444
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:24,960
devices

445
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:29,039
so but we can actually extrapolate this

446
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:29,679
table

447
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:32,400
to estimate the price of a high voltage

448
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,480
device even if the price of renting a

449
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,400
high voltage device is 10 times

450
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:39,039
20 times bigger than this even 100 times

451
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:40,160
bigger than this

452
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,640
it's still feasible to perform the

453
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:44,559
attack and we're expecting

454
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:46,799
uh to see more high wattage devices in

455
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:48,000
the future

456
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:52,799
after the publications of these recent

457
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:56,559
research works from the

458
00:18:56,559 --> 00:18:58,640
power get perspective we can see that

459
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,320
this these two figures

460
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:03,200
show that they had a real-time market

461
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,600
prices of the

462
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:08,880
new york uh market as you can see

463
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:11,679
the day ahead prices are lower than the

464
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:13,280
real-time prices in this

465
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:15,600
specific hour and this is because of the

466
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:18,000
load forecasting error that happened at

467
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,640
that time

468
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:25,360
from the end user's perspective and it

469
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:27,360
the attacks effect on the billing

470
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:31,039
statement uh by some technical analysis

471
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:32,480
we know that the average power

472
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:33,520
consumption

473
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:36,640
of american homes is

474
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:39,679
not almost 900 kilowatt hour

475
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:42,320
and if we assume that we have a hundred

476
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,160
thousand bots each part

477
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:46,799
consuming three kilowatts of power and

478
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:47,280
we

479
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:49,919
perform the attack hundred days per year

480
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:51,440
or eight days per month

481
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:55,520
not every day and each device can

482
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:58,000
be turned on or off for three hours on

483
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,120
average

484
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:01,840
its effect is going to be seven percent

485
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:03,760
increase in the billing statement in the

486
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:06,320
most severe case of the time

487
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:09,039
so it's almost unnoticeable so if you're

488
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:09,919
paying

489
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:13,039
100 for your electricity bill

490
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:15,200
if you have a compromise but in your

491
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,520
house you're going to pay 107

492
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:21,360
which is totally unnoticeable

493
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:24,480
but we need stealth strategies uh

494
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,720
to guarantee the repeatability and the

495
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:27,520
attack

496
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:30,559
uh and this repeatability will

497
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:33,520
increase the attack gain in general and

498
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:33,840
this

499
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:35,679
increase in the attacking will add to

500
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:37,440
the motivation of the attackers

501
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:39,760
and also the stealth would add to the

502
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:42,400
motivation of the attackers to

503
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:46,159
avoid law related repercussions

504
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:49,360
the first stealthy strategy we need to

505
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:52,799
uh hide the attack

506
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:56,720
from the from the market operator

507
00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:00,559
so but can you change the demand of the

508
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:02,799
system severely most likely

509
00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:06,240
no because the the system operator would

510
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:06,880
easily

511
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:09,520
notice there is something weird going on

512
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:10,080
this is

513
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:14,159
not a typical load profile in the system

514
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:16,480
and there's something weird going on so

515
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,720
it's probably an attack

516
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:21,760
so but if we limit the attack and

517
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:25,360
if you limit the many market uh

518
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:27,760
demand manipulation to a typical load

519
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:29,760
forecasting error

520
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:32,400
similar to what we have shown in this

521
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,320
figure it's almost unnoticeable

522
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:36,480
so as a market operator when i'm seeing

523
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:37,679
one of these

524
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:41,600
uh one of these curves here as a load

525
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:44,880
a real-time system load and

526
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:48,240
the black line shows the data head

527
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:51,919
line they had load forecasting line

528
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:53,760
we're changing the system demand in the

529
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:55,840
error bank so it's

530
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:58,720
there's it's almost unnoticeable and you

531
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:01,120
can't distinguish between the

532
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:04,720
actual system change or actual

533
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:08,240
uh load forecasting error or

534
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:11,840
any attacks the second strategy would be

535
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:13,760
the frequency of attack

536
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,919
you can't launch the attack every day

537
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:17,840
because you're incurring too much

538
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:20,400
risk and there's a high chance of being

539
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,240
caught and detected

540
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:24,159
but if you launch the attack 100 days

541
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:25,440
per year

542
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:27,520
it's reasonable because you're launching

543
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:29,520
the tax eight days per month

544
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:33,360
and even if you are too conservative you

545
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:41,840
can reduce this number to 50.

546
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:46,159
uh this the other stealth strategy would

547
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:48,320
be implementing the suboptimal attack

548
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,600
scenarios

549
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:52,000
and we can choose some optimal attack

550
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,120
vector

551
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:55,280
this will make it harder for the market

552
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:57,440
analyzer to detect the attack

553
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,080
and he might find the other innocent

554
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:03,840
players guilty in this case

555
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:08,480
we can also deliberately

556
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:11,840
target the other players uh

557
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:13,520
in this case the attacker might

558
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:16,000
intentionally target his competitors to

559
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:16,559
damage

560
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:19,600
certain companies and players

561
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:22,799
and this will lift the suspicion from

562
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:24,080
himself

563
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:27,280
to the other companies

564
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:32,640
we can we should also uh manipulate

565
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:36,080
in bots in a smart way for example

566
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:38,480
if you categorize different devices and

567
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:42,000
their availability time

568
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,960
you can change them smartly for example

569
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:46,799
for the electric vehicle which

570
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:49,919
has been proven to have a great

571
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:52,240
potential

572
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:54,720
you can change them during the midnight

573
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:55,440
where

574
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:58,159
they're connected to the charger and the

575
00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:01,279
homeowner is usually asleep

576
00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:03,679
but for the other devices such as hvac

577
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:04,799
systems you can

578
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:07,200
change there and manipulate them when

579
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,880
the homeowner is not home

580
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:12,799
usually between 9 a.m to 11 a.m or 12

581
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:13,760
a.m

582
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:16,799
12 p.m it's a good time to turn on or

583
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:18,000
off those devices

584
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,240
so

585
00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:22,880
now let's talk about the numerical

586
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:25,360
results for evaluation purposes

587
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:28,480
we didn't implement the

588
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:30,960
this specific attack iot schema in

589
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:32,080
practice because

590
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:34,640
it has a huge high financial effect on

591
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:35,919
the market

592
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:38,080
and just to avoid the law related

593
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:39,679
repercussions

594
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:42,720
uh we used but we use real world data

595
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:43,919
analysis for

596
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:45,600
showing the effect of the attack from

597
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,600
the two biggest markets in the u.s new

598
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:50,480
york and california markets

599
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:53,520
we collected one-year data from those

600
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:55,840
markets from their official website

601
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:58,159
because they're sharing their real-time

602
00:24:58,159 --> 00:24:59,200
information

603
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,960
officially from their websites and

604
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:02,640
they're updating that

605
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:05,440
and every five minutes and it's just

606
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:07,919
crazy

607
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,480
the first step would be estimating the

608
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:12,640
key parameters based on the historical

609
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:14,159
data the first parameter

610
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:17,279
is the price load sensitivity so

611
00:25:17,279 --> 00:25:19,919
we need to estimate that at every hour

612
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:21,919
if we change the price

613
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:25,039
to a certain point uh if we change the

614
00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:27,360
demand to a certain point how much price

615
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:28,320
is going to change

616
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:31,919
by studying the historical data of the

617
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:33,679
california new york market and

618
00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:35,440
california market

619
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:37,600
we noticed that we obtained these two

620
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:38,559
figures

621
00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:40,640
for the price load sensitivity as you

622
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,000
can see it's different

623
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,120
for different markets but the trend

624
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:48,000
is almost the same but the numbers are a

625
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,400
little bit different so

626
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:53,200
you have to analyze the historical

627
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:55,600
market of each specific market to obtain

628
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:56,960
this parameter it's

629
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:59,520
different for each market and also for

630
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:01,440
estimating the error band and load

631
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:03,360
forecasting error band

632
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:06,159
of different markets we studied again

633
00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:08,240
the historical data and we obtained

634
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:08,799
these

635
00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:10,720
two figures the top figure is for the

636
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:12,240
new york and the bottom figure

637
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:15,919
is for the california market

638
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,919
okay for the attacker type one attacker

639
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:23,360
is a market player

640
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:26,799
and a typical power plant owner

641
00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:30,000
with 2 000 megawatt capacity we assume

642
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,120
that

643
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:34,559
the market player it has this specific

644
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:38,320
characteristic and we showed that for

645
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:41,520
different botnet sizes and for on

646
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:42,799
average different

647
00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:45,440
uh power consumption in each bot one

648
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:47,679
represents one kilowatt two kilowatt

649
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:48,960
three kilowatt for

650
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:51,120
average of the power consumption of each

651
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:53,360
pot and this is the size of the button

652
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:56,159
as the size of the bottleneck increases

653
00:26:56,159 --> 00:26:58,720
we have a bigger

654
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:02,000
a daily additional profit but for a

655
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:02,799
typical

656
00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:06,240
botnet size such as 100 000 watts

657
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:09,600
uh we can make almost uh

658
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:13,600
500 uh 500

659
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:18,559
i'm sorry 50 000 dollars per day or

660
00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:21,279
additional profit for this specific

661
00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:24,080
market player

662
00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:26,640
and at the same time we're keeping the

663
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,399
tax stealthy as you can see

664
00:27:28,399 --> 00:27:32,000
for different attack gains uh we have

665
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,919
uh very still within the error band and

666
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:39,120
the marketplace market operator cannot

667
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:42,640
notice any unusual activity from the

668
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:46,159
load profile of the system

669
00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:49,840
for the attacker uh type 2

670
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:53,360
uh which is a nation-state actor he can

671
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:56,720
do this based on as a part of a trade or

672
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:57,919
cold war

673
00:27:57,919 --> 00:28:00,480
and he wants to target the let's say

674
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:02,799
generation side companies

675
00:28:02,799 --> 00:28:06,559
as you can see in a typical botnet size

676
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:07,279
of 100

677
00:28:07,279 --> 00:28:10,880
000 bots the attacker can make

678
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:14,080
in the new york market he can make

679
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:16,559
almost 2 million dollar economic damage

680
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:17,200
per day

681
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:19,039
that he launched the deck so if he

682
00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:21,039
launched the attack 100 days per year

683
00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:22,480
it's gonna be

684
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:25,840
100 million dollars

685
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:29,200
and uh again the trend

686
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:33,039
is very similar once you increase the

687
00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:36,159
size of the botnet the economic damage

688
00:28:36,159 --> 00:28:37,919
would increase as well

689
00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:40,320
and also what if the average power

690
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,559
consumption of each bot increases the

691
00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:43,440
attack

692
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:46,960
also increases as well

693
00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:50,480
again the attack is stealthy we're

694
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:52,720
changing the system demand in the error

695
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:54,240
band and

696
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:58,000
the system operator cannot

697
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:02,159
notice any change in the system

698
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:08,799
finally we have again the nation state

699
00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:09,520
actor

700
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:12,240
but this time instead of targeting the

701
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:14,720
generation side companies and players

702
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:16,799
he is targeting the demand side

703
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:19,120
companies or the retainers

704
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:22,240
again with a typical botnet size

705
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:27,120
of a hundred thousand hundred fifty 000

706
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:30,880
we have over 2 million

707
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:33,679
economic damage which can be incurred

708
00:29:33,679 --> 00:29:35,039
daily on the

709
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:38,000
on the market players again we have the

710
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,679
similar trend

711
00:29:39,679 --> 00:29:42,559
as the size of the botnet increases the

712
00:29:42,559 --> 00:29:44,880
the gain of the attack increases as well

713
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,559
and also as the

714
00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:49,200
average power consumption of each bot

715
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:51,039
within the botnet increases

716
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:53,520
we have the increase in the attack game

717
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:55,840
as well

718
00:29:57,039 --> 00:30:00,399
but uh we talked about the attack effect

719
00:30:00,399 --> 00:30:01,679
based on the

720
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:04,480
real world data information but what

721
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:06,080
about the countermeasures

722
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:09,200
what we can do to prevent this attack or

723
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:10,159
even

724
00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:14,000
reduce the damaging consequences

725
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,320
the first countermeasure that we propose

726
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:17,600
in this presentation

727
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:20,880
is to develop a real-time iot

728
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:24,559
monitoring database so

729
00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:27,919
what is this concept

730
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:31,120
let's say we convince the big vendors of

731
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:31,919
the iot

732
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:35,440
such as high-wattage iit developers such

733
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:36,080
as

734
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:38,880
honeywell nest or general electric

735
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:40,480
schneider electric

736
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:43,600
to register a portion of their devices

737
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:46,640
in an online database

738
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:49,600
in where we can monitor the real-time

739
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:50,240
behavior

740
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:53,600
of those devices such as if they can

741
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:57,440
be if they're being

742
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:00,720
simultaneously turned on or turned off

743
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:02,799
and in this case if there is any

744
00:31:02,799 --> 00:31:04,240
suspicious behavior

745
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:07,200
in a portion of those devices we can

746
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:08,799
treat it as an anomaly

747
00:31:08,799 --> 00:31:11,760
or we can detect something is going

748
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:13,120
wrong

749
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:16,399
for example if we can only register one

750
00:31:16,399 --> 00:31:18,960
percent of the old high wattage

751
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:22,240
available high voltage iot devices

752
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:25,440
and if we're seeing weird behaviors and

753
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:28,000
simultaneous behaviors in certain hours

754
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,240
in just one percent of those one percent

755
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:32,559
devices

756
00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:34,960
we can conclude that there's something

757
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:38,000
going wrong here

758
00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:40,000
the other countermeasure would be

759
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
revisited market data sharing

760
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:46,240
and in this case we're arguing that the

761
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:49,679
data privacy plans should be developed

762
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:52,399
to not to share this real-time market

763
00:31:52,399 --> 00:31:53,919
data

764
00:31:53,919 --> 00:31:57,039
with everyone in the public this will

765
00:31:57,039 --> 00:32:00,080
almost significantly reduce

766
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:03,039
the risk of nation state attacker even

767
00:32:03,039 --> 00:32:04,559
for the market players

768
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:07,600
uh we propose to release the

769
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:09,840
pre-processed and delayed version of the

770
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:10,320
data

771
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:12,880
instead of the real-time version and by

772
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:14,399
implementing this specific

773
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:16,240
countermeasure we can see

774
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:18,240
the attack game for the nation state

775
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:19,279
actor

776
00:32:19,279 --> 00:32:23,600
is significantly reduced here

777
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:26,880
again the other countermeasure could be

778
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,080
a policy

779
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:30,799
related thing and it's limiting the

780
00:32:30,799 --> 00:32:32,799
price sensitivity in the real-time

781
00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:33,840
market

782
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:36,720
so in this case we don't allow the price

783
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:37,039
a

784
00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:40,159
change from like zero or even

785
00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:44,080
negative to to an astronomical value

786
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:46,240
uh in this case if you can limit the

787
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:48,080
price for example to

788
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:51,760
to to 20 percent the attack gain here in

789
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:54,159
this figure we've shown that it reduces

790
00:32:54,159 --> 00:32:57,840
a lot

791
00:32:57,919 --> 00:33:00,960
finally as far as the conclusions and

792
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:04,159
possible directions

793
00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:07,440
an iot botnet based attack on the

794
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:09,120
electricity market

795
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:12,399
was introduced in this presentation

796
00:33:12,399 --> 00:33:15,600
and it was the first

797
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:18,640
market manipulation cyber attack that is

798
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:20,640
available in the literature

799
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:22,880
its effect was analyzed on two sample

800
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:25,279
big electricity markets in the u.s

801
00:33:25,279 --> 00:33:29,120
california and new york markets

802
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:33,279
as we've seen in by our data analysis

803
00:33:33,279 --> 00:33:36,960
you can close over 24 million dollars

804
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:41,120
you can make over 24 million dollar

805
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:44,559
further yearly profit as a malicious

806
00:33:44,559 --> 00:33:46,880
market player

807
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:49,519
and even for the nation state actor you

808
00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:50,000
can

809
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:54,240
make you can cause a 350 million dollar

810
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:58,640
economic damage on the market players

811
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:02,399
finally we propose the set up practical

812
00:34:02,399 --> 00:34:05,760
countermeasures to to

813
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:08,079
reduce the attacking and to reduce the

814
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:11,359
damaging consequences of the attack

815
00:34:11,359 --> 00:34:13,918
and we hope to raise the attention of

816
00:34:13,918 --> 00:34:16,079
the market operators that this

817
00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:18,560
unnecessary data sharing might be

818
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:20,000
maliciously used by

819
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:23,520
different ways to attack the market

820
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:27,199
but for the future work and possible

821
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:27,918
direction

822
00:34:27,918 --> 00:34:31,839
we we think that the further research

823
00:34:31,839 --> 00:34:34,639
and analysis

824
00:34:35,359 --> 00:34:38,159
are required to develop more effective

825
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:40,159
countermeasures to defend against the

826
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:41,760
iot skimmer attack

827
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:46,399
and the similar attacks in this domain

828
00:34:46,879 --> 00:34:48,719
thank you for listening to our

829
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:50,480
presentation and

830
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:54,960
we're here for the questions thank you
