[Music]

2
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:14,960
okay

3
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:18,480
uh hello everyone uh welcome to our talk

4
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:20,400
uh my name is weibai i'm a software

5
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:21,840
engineer at google

6
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:24,000
uh today omar and i are going to present

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:24,960
our work

8
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:28,840
improving mental models of and encrypted

9
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:30,480
communications

10
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,558
this work is a joint efforts together

11
00:00:32,558 --> 00:00:33,760
with shruti

12
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:36,160
michael and professor mitchell manzurek

13
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:38,000
from university of maryland

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,079
as well as dr patrick gage kelly from

15
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:41,520
google

16
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,840
so the contents we present today are our

17
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:44,640
own opinions

18
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,640
and we do not represent the view of

19
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:49,039
google

20
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:52,000
okay so what is end-to-end encryption uh

21
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:52,960
well

22
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:55,039
this talk is not about the technical

23
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:56,960
details about anton encryption

24
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:59,760
or e2e and i believe you all know what

25
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:00,399
a2e

26
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:02,879
is and why it's important so your

27
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:03,760
messages are

28
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:06,479
protected from end to end and it can

29
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:07,920
protect the users from

30
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,560
various merchant actors such as hackers

31
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:11,439
governments

32
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:14,000
misbehaving employees or the companies

33
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,720
people do not trust

34
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:18,960
um in this talk uh we would like to talk

35
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:22,240
about the adoption of anton encryption

36
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:24,720
but this talk is not focusing on the

37
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,960
people in this room

38
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:28,960
that said this talk is not for the

39
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,159
security experts

40
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:32,799
or people with high computer literacy

41
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:34,079
because we think these people

42
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:36,000
already have enough knowledge to make

43
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,200
informed decisions about

44
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,920
when and how to use this uh such e2e

45
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,840
tools

46
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:44,399
similarly we are not targeting people

47
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:46,880
with special needs of security privacy

48
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:50,240
such as lawyers journalists or activists

49
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,640
who may face life and death scenarios if

50
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,799
their security and privacy breaks

51
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:57,600
well these people are very important but

52
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,119
since they have special needs

53
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:01,040
they should be studied and designed for

54
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,320
separately so

55
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:06,398
these are not the focus in our talk

56
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,720
this talk is about the very general

57
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:09,840
users

58
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,080
and we're interested in theater adoption

59
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,440
of e2e tools

60
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,360
because it improved the privacy for the

61
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,720
masses

62
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:19,120
and all of our studies presented today

63
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:21,040
recruited people with minimal knowledge

64
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,840
of encryption

65
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,720
so do general users adopt android

66
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:27,920
encryption tools

67
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:30,640
well at least we see a trend of adoption

68
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:31,200
increase

69
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,519
over the past two decades and the whole

70
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:35,200
community has helped them to conquer

71
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,239
many hurdles

72
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:39,519
in front of them one of such hurdle is

73
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:41,120
the ui design

74
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,959
the battery ui design may make this

75
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:45,200
system hard to use

76
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,440
however this has been improved

77
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:48,720
significantly

78
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,800
over the past two decades through a lot

79
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,519
of hard work

80
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:55,360
another hurdle is about the key

81
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,760
distribution and the management

82
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:00,159
this is still some problems problems in

83
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:01,840
some certain ways

84
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,239
but centralized directories are we call

85
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:06,640
the key directory based models here

86
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,640
that have been deployed by many popular

87
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,800
messaging services

88
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,959
and even though there are some still

89
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:15,040
some issues like key revocation or key

90
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,080
validation

91
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,400
but generally speaking it has been

92
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,760
solved um

93
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:22,480
kind of well

94
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:24,879
um another hurdle is about the social

95
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:26,640
norms uh well

96
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,360
encryption used to be perceived as weird

97
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,040
or even paranoid

98
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,640
and that may imply that you have

99
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,640
something to hide or even you are a

100
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:35,760
criminal

101
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,400
um but now since the widespread

102
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,760
deployment for the

103
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:42,239
instant messaging services like whatsapp

104
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:43,200
signal

105
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:46,319
facebook messenger secret chat like this

106
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:48,560
so this has made this the situation

107
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:51,760
situations much better

108
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:55,680
okay however recent research has

109
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,680
repeatedly identified that

110
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:00,400
incorrect mental models of a2ee have

111
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,239
become the biggest hurdle now for the

112
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:03,599
adoption for the uh

113
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:06,799
for the general users uh

114
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:09,120
what are mental models well mental

115
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,560
models describes

116
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:13,599
how a user thinks about the problem it's

117
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:14,080
basically

118
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,079
a person's perception about how things

119
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:18,478
work and people use these models to make

120
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:20,238
decisions about the effects

121
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:23,280
of various actions

122
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:26,080
bothers down to securing privacy uses

123
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,440
mental models

124
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:30,080
makes users to make security decisions

125
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,000
and by understanding the user's

126
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,240
mental models it can it can help the

127
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,000
community to categorize

128
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,160
and understand the security problems

129
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:42,000
that result from these decisions

130
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,759
uh and the more specifically about

131
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:46,400
adoption of android encryption tools

132
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,720
why do you incremental uh when why do

133
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,000
incorrect mental models

134
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,120
matter here for adoption uh well here i

135
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,120
list the several evidence that we found

136
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:57,360
from the recent research

137
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,440
first people perceive anton encryption

138
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:00,639
incorrectly

139
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:03,759
in both directions both overestimate and

140
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:06,800
under underestimate its capabilities for

141
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:07,440
example

142
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,520
some users think encryption can protect

143
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,039
them from anything

144
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:12,880
while some other users think encryption

145
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,960
can be trivially broken by anyone

146
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:17,120
who works in the iit industry or even

147
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:20,000
have id background

148
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,800
secondly incorrect mental models makes

149
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,080
it difficult for users

150
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,680
to make thoughtful and informed

151
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:28,320
decisions about what you to use

152
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:31,360
to communicate for example some users

153
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,840
think sms is the most secure messaging

154
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,199
service

155
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:38,160
to that end if these users want to

156
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,360
really want to send some

157
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:42,080
some information um uh important and

158
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,360
private

159
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,199
and they may choose a tool that they

160
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:46,560
think is secure

161
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,479
but actually are not as secure as they

162
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:50,960
expected

163
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,600
uh finally uh some users still struggle

164
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,840
to complete some tasks within these e2e

165
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:56,880
tools

166
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,880
well their struggles are not many

167
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,400
because the ui design

168
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,720
but more because of their broken mental

169
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:03,919
models

170
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:06,080
that's why they have to do these tasks

171
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,479
and what security benefits they can get

172
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:11,919
from these tasks one of one of such

173
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:12,560
examples

174
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,560
is performing the authentic

175
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,160
authentication ceremony

176
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:19,360
within the e2e2 and here is screenshots

177
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:22,960
about this scenario in whatsapp

178
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,120
so to recap uh incorrect mental models

179
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:31,199
uh can prohibit inhibit um general users

180
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:33,120
using the android encryption tools

181
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,120
confidently proactively

182
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:38,880
and correctly so this really motivates

183
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:39,680
our research

184
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:42,479
that we would like to improve user's

185
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:43,600
mental models

186
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,120
and help them get the basic

187
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,360
understanding of e2e

188
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,680
and also the threads into e can and

189
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:52,800
cannot protect against

190
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,400
so that users can have enough

191
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,919
information to make judgments

192
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:58,560
about how to communicate but our

193
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:59,759
educational process

194
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:02,080
we do not expect to turn everyone into

195
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,360
crypto experts

196
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,440
uh we understand it's neither possible

197
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,520
nor desirable

198
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:10,639
and also we do not expect people to sign

199
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:12,560
them for some training modules

200
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,960
because we think that in real life

201
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,000
people may not have

202
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,840
enough time and motivation to do so

203
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:23,199
so our efforts want to improve the user

204
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:24,160
mental models

205
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,639
naturally in a sense that we hope to

206
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:27,759
provide uh youth

207
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:30,800
useful information in smart doses

208
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,639
directly while they're using end-to-end

209
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:35,120
encryption tools

210
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,199
so our research involves multi-stage

211
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:39,440
efforts from the lab study to a field

212
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:43,120
study the first step is the lab study

213
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,599
where we invite participants to our dad

214
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:47,919
and learn an in-depth tutorial

215
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:49,599
and here we would like to understand

216
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:52,080
what contents about about e2e

217
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,759
can be used in the educational

218
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:55,919
intervention

219
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:58,400
based on the lab studies results and we

220
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,759
designed

221
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:03,039
several messages about e2e that have

222
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:04,960
varying in length and contents

223
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:07,120
and then we deploy online service study

224
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,000
and to understand

225
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,639
how people's perceptions are shifted by

226
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:11,599
this

227
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:15,520
by this short messages uh finally uh

228
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:16,800
based on the second

229
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,440
service study we pick several candidate

230
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,160
messages

231
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,800
and fit these messages into a real app

232
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,400
and then we deploy a field

233
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:27,199
study where we ask our participants to

234
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:28,720
use in their real life

235
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:31,199
for around three weeks and by getting

236
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:33,039
their feedback we hope to understand

237
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:34,799
whether our educational intervention

238
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:37,439
works or not

239
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:40,159
so next i'm going to talk about the lab

240
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:40,880
study

241
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,958
and omer will present the details from

242
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:46,800
this survey and a few studies later

243
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:50,320
so lab study uh to recap the goal of

244
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,640
this lab study is to understand

245
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:55,680
what contents of a2e can be used

246
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,760
in the educational intervention and more

247
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:58,800
specifically

248
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,519
we're interesting to get a user's

249
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:02,480
perspective

250
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,959
about what information is important

251
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:06,240
surprising to them

252
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,640
and what contents about e2e can be used

253
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,560
to convey to others

254
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:14,399
uh so each pers so we recruit 25

255
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:16,320
non-expert participants from washington

256
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,800
washington dc area and each participant

257
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,880
was shown a short tutorial

258
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:23,839
about end-to-end encryption

259
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,320
and before and after reading tutorial

260
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:29,120
each participant was giving a short quiz

261
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:32,320
assessing their understanding of e2e so

262
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,240
here we not only

263
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:37,519
care about their quiz answers but also

264
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:39,440
more importantly about the reasons

265
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,200
uh behind the wisely through certain

266
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,440
answers

267
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,680
uh so by comparing the the answers and

268
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:46,640
the reasons behind

269
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:49,120
before and after reading the tutorial we

270
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,080
hope to understand

271
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,720
uh what con what part of the contents uh

272
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:56,320
in the tutorial went through or not

273
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,920
and then we give each participants

274
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:00,320
particip participant a short discussion

275
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,399
and explicitly they ask them their

276
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:04,320
feedback about what contents in a

277
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,720
tutorial is important surprising to them

278
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:09,279
and worth mentioning uh if as if they

279
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:10,000
were um

280
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,440
teaching e2e to others

281
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,160
uh next we give each participant a two

282
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:17,519
short existing

283
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:20,959
explanations about e2e where we got from

284
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:21,279
uh

285
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:24,320
six uh real apps and we got these

286
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,760
explanations from the

287
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:28,720
apps uh description app descriptions uh

288
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:29,279
official

289
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:31,760
websites as well as white papers if

290
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,200
available

291
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,200
and we ask every person to mark any

292
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,959
places they like or dislike

293
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:39,040
so that we can get feedback uh what

294
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:42,000
contents matter to them

295
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,079
uh finally we give each person a short

296
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:46,560
design task and ask them to

297
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,880
design a sample message about e2e

298
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:49,680
education

299
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:52,160
intervention as if they were teaching

300
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:54,880
a2e to their friends or family

301
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:58,000
so with this whole chain of study setup

302
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,079
we hope to get a rich feedback from the

303
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:01,680
participant participants

304
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:05,199
to achieve our goal

305
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:06,720
as we mentioned previously uh the

306
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,800
tutorial was designed by us

307
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:11,200
and we designed a tutorial in a module

308
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,399
based fashion

309
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:15,040
where we included four modules uh a

310
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:15,519
hello

311
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:18,640
overview of what a to e is

312
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:21,440
a block of risks uh that a to e can and

313
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,959
cannot protect against

314
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:25,600
and we got this risk uh risks from the

315
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:26,399
uh uh

316
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:30,880
from the risk communication literature

317
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:33,760
uh and also uh the third module is uh

318
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:34,160
some

319
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,480
common misconceptions about ate where we

320
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,279
also

321
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:39,760
got from prior research and finally a

322
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:43,519
high level description of how e2e works

323
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:46,160
but here we want to emphasize that our

324
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:47,839
goal is not to assess the

325
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:50,480
tutorials itself because the outcome of

326
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:51,120
a study

327
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:54,320
is not to develop a tutorial that can be

328
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,639
used for the educational intervention

329
00:11:56,639 --> 00:11:59,279
but rather we're interested in what

330
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:00,880
information is worthy and important to

331
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,240
our participants

332
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:04,560
so that we can include these specific

333
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:05,600
contents

334
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,680
in the further educational intervention

335
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:11,120
in a natural scenario so as a result

336
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,800
different participants saw different

337
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,720
subsets of these four modules

338
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,160
so that we can have a better

339
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:19,680
understanding of how each module

340
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:23,200
shifted each person's i mean users

341
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:26,560
perceptions about e2e

342
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,440
next i'm going to highlight a couple of

343
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,440
high-level findings from the study

344
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,279
and for the full findings please refer

345
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:35,360
to our paper

346
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,120
first we found that to other

347
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:39,120
participants computationality

348
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,760
is the most significant factor well even

349
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,120
though it's a little bit

350
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:45,680
less surprising to us but to at least to

351
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:46,720
other participants

352
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,880
this thing is really important to grasp

353
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:50,320
grasp concept

354
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:53,600
of e2e at this prism set

355
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,680
the internet service provider and the

356
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:56,720
app company

357
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:59,360
may still get a copy of the message that

358
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:01,040
is protected by this wall

359
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:03,600
that is nearly impossible to break so

360
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,279
they can see you send a message

361
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:08,720
but they can't see what the message says

362
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:11,760
well within this tutorial i mean module

363
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,760
we also found some scientists were

364
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,279
spreading to our participants

365
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:17,920
and even surprised to us for example

366
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:19,839
some participants were surprised that

367
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:23,279
isps are even in domestic past and e2e

368
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:26,399
can protect against them

369
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,839
next we found that explaining risks

370
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:31,279
clearly to our participants

371
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:34,399
is really useful in particular our

372
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:36,079
participants really liked comparison

373
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:38,639
between e2e versus 92e

374
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:41,600
in a sense that how e2e is better as

375
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:42,880
this person said

376
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:45,920
knowing the risks of the non-e2e

377
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:48,240
and then really comparing it to how it

378
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,120
is better

379
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:52,160
that's really the most important

380
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:54,000
uh as we mentioned previously that we

381
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,839
all in the risk module

382
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:58,480
uh we also we detailed what types of the

383
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:59,040
risks

384
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:02,160
that e2e can and cannot protect against

385
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,920
and to our participants it's really

386
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:05,519
important to clarify the

387
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:08,639
weaknesses of e2e as well as benefits

388
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,560
and we think it's important because it

389
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,959
can correct the wrong mental models

390
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:14,800
of both overestimating and

391
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:19,040
underestimating the e2e capabilities

392
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:22,880
however other endeavors about explaining

393
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:24,639
integrity and authenticity

394
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:27,440
were somehow not really successful and

395
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:28,000
the

396
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
and this concept is still confusing to

397
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,519
other participants

398
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:33,680
uh some participants were still uh i

399
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:36,240
mean uh conflicted authenticity with

400
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:39,199
username and password protection uh as

401
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:40,720
this participant said

402
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,800
e2e protects against the message

403
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:45,120
modification and impersonation

404
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,440
not even user names and or passwords can

405
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,600
be stolen or guessed

406
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:52,959
which is clearly wrong

407
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:56,399
finally our module to explain how it

408
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:58,399
works in the high level

409
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:00,240
is a little bit less interesting to

410
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,440
other participants

411
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:04,079
and it can even create more confusions

412
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:04,880
for example

413
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,399
after learning tutorial some

414
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:08,399
participants concerned about the

415
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:10,480
attacker's ability to force the private

416
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:11,680
keys

417
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:13,839
as this participant said if you're

418
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:14,959
working in a locksmith's

419
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:17,600
office you might not have somebody's key

420
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,120
but you would be able to get

421
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:22,000
into the house because you're an expert

422
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:22,240
and

423
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:27,120
you know how to manipulate systems

424
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:30,160
so to really quit so to recap i was with

425
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:32,480
this uh high-level pieces of information

426
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,639
about successful and non-successful

427
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:35,440
information

428
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:38,560
uh during the initial study uh we found

429
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:40,920
that uh explaining um

430
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:43,680
connecting is the most significant

431
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:44,560
factor

432
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:46,560
and explaining risks clearly to other

433
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:47,839
users is really

434
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:50,720
uh useful uh and in particular our

435
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:53,199
participants really like the comparison

436
00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:55,759
e to e versus nine into e in a sense how

437
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:57,600
it is better

438
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,360
and also it's important to clarify the

439
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:01,360
weaknesses of e2e together with its

440
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,959
benefits

441
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:04,959
but in the same time we also found some

442
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:06,480
pieces of information

443
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:09,199
may not worth mentioning uh including

444
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:11,440
integrity authenticity and how each

445
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:14,240
year works at least in our study uh we

446
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,839
do not find strong evidence

447
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:17,920
that this contents can improve the user

448
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:19,839
mentors mental models very

449
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:23,279
very well okay so uh

450
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:25,440
next uh omer will present how our

451
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,759
findings from the lab study

452
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:30,240
can be applied to the large scale and

453
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:30,880
i'm going to

454
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:34,240
hand up to omer hi everyone

455
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:36,399
i'm omer i'm a graduate assistant at the

456
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:38,480
university of maryland and i'll be

457
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:42,079
presenting the rest of this talk

458
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:46,000
so like we mentioned before the

459
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,720
this effort of trying to shift mental

460
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,240
models of users

461
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:52,160
about end-to-end encryption it's a

462
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:53,759
three-stage approach

463
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:55,600
the first was a lab study we already

464
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,440
described that now we're going to move

465
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:58,480
on to the

466
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:01,519
online survey study so the results we

467
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:03,440
obtained from study one they feed

468
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:04,959
directly into study two

469
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:06,959
the questions we're going after here are

470
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:08,400
pretty similar we're trying

471
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:11,039
still trying to shift uh mental models

472
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:12,160
of users

473
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:15,679
uh uh mental models users have about

474
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:18,240
end-to-end encryption

475
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:20,079
but this time we're trying to shift them

476
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:22,799
with short messages that are easy

477
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:24,720
that can be easily integrated into

478
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,640
applications

479
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,880
we design a couple different length

480
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,720
messages uh we have the

481
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:34,559
long message which is intended to cover

482
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:36,480
uh basically all the points that we

483
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,480
found effective from study one

484
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:42,080
um it's intended for say an applications

485
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:43,280
info web page

486
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:46,240
kind of like a more about page we have

487
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:47,440
short messages

488
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:50,000
that cover single concise talking points

489
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,080
uh kind of like the modules uh from the

490
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:52,880
tutorial

491
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:56,160
it just talks about one thing and these

492
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,679
are intended to be used

493
00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:00,880
in loading screens or you know as tool

494
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:01,600
tips

495
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:04,400
maybe notifications uh so easily

496
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,160
integrate them into the application we

497
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,840
have medium length messages

498
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:09,919
which are somewhere in between they

499
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:11,520
don't cover all the topics but they

500
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:11,919
cover

501
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:15,520
more than one topic we are interested in

502
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:17,600
how effective these messages are how the

503
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,200
different lengths compare

504
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,960
and uh for what purposes they can be

505
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,400
used for

506
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,480
we it's important to note here that we

507
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,320
don't want to oversell security and

508
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:28,160
sharing encryption is great but it also

509
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:29,600
has its limitations

510
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,679
and we definitely want to communicate

511
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:33,840
that

512
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,520
now let's let's look at the setup of

513
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,520
study2 uh well it's an

514
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:39,200
online study and we recruit our

515
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,440
participants through crowdsourcing

516
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:44,160
uh it's it's a we recruit specifically

517
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,679
from a platform called

518
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:49,200
uh prolific and we have 461 participants

519
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,720
who participate in this study

520
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:53,120
so it's a more large-scale study we

521
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:54,400
designed a couple different

522
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:58,480
uh messages for each message length

523
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:01,440
and we'll get back get to that later

524
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,280
these messages all refer to a

525
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:05,440
hypothetical messaging app called text

526
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:05,760
lite

527
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:08,640
and we do this to remove any brand bias

528
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:10,320
that people might have

529
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:12,160
towards certain messaging brands

530
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:14,880
messaging apps

531
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,799
it's a between subject's design which

532
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:18,000
basically means

533
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,039
that each participant gets to see

534
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:23,360
one version of the message and they

535
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:24,799
don't know the existence of the other

536
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:27,120
messages this allows us to compare

537
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:30,640
the different groups to each other and

538
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,240
basically be able to compare the

539
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:34,480
different messages and reason which one

540
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,240
was better

541
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,799
we quiz our participants before and

542
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:40,480
after reading the message this is how we

543
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,320
measure their changes in their mental

544
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:43,039
models

545
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:45,280
uh the quiz essentially asks about

546
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:46,720
various adversaries and their

547
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:47,840
capabilities

548
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:49,919
over the application and asks

549
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:51,360
participants

550
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:53,760
to indicate how much they agree with

551
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:54,960
certain statements

552
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,160
about these adversaries and their

553
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:58,240
capabilities

554
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:00,640
we measured the change in score by

555
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,799
essentially subtracting the scores they

556
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:04,159
got from the quiz

557
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:07,039
from the after quiz uh we subtract uh

558
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:09,360
the after quiz from the before quiz

559
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:10,720
or it's the other way around we subtract

560
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,400
the before quiz one after quiz

561
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,960
all right so from the participant's

562
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:17,039
point of view this is what it looks like

563
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:19,360
uh they see the adversary capability

564
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:20,080
questions so

565
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:23,200
for instance here uh it says indicate

566
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,440
whether you agree or disagree that

567
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:27,039
hackers who have compromised the text

568
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:27,840
light servers

569
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:29,600
have the following abilities the first

570
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,520
ability is being able to see that a

571
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:32,400
message was sent

572
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:35,840
without seeing the content

573
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:39,760
and this person is in the middle

574
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:41,440
they read the message about end-to-end

575
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,120
encryption and then

576
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:44,880
they take the exit survey which is again

577
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,880
the same questions here you can see they

578
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,000
say they agree that

579
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,039
they can know that the message was sent

580
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:54,080
without knowing the content all right so

581
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:56,080
that's it for the participants

582
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,600
now let's look at some of our message

583
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,679
types that we've developed

584
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:01,120
like i said there are a couple different

585
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:02,720
lengths uh the short ones

586
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:05,039
the first short message talks about how

587
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:06,559
only you and the recipient

588
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:08,559
can see the messages uh this is kind of

589
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:10,159
a general overview of what end-to-end

590
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:10,880
encryption is

591
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,720
the second one talks about metadata

592
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:14,080
risks uh

593
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:16,480
for insta for instance the employee

594
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,640
adversary uh being able to

595
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:22,320
see a message was sent uh we also talked

596
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:24,159
about uh endpoint risks

597
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:27,200
uh so this is uh just referring to the

598
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,880
fact that end-to-end encryption can't do

599
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:29,520
much

600
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:32,400
if the end points are compromised we

601
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,320
talk about the key lock metaphor this is

602
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:35,360
again similar to

603
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,520
one where it gives an overall view of

604
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:39,679
what end-to-end encryption is

605
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:42,159
without giving any technical details and

606
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:43,679
then we have the last one which is

607
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:45,440
comparing end-to-end encryption

608
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:47,919
to tools that are not antoine encrypted

609
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:49,440
we have two mid-length

610
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:52,320
medium length messages and uh these are

611
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:52,880
basically

612
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:55,679
combinations of the short messages um

613
00:21:55,679 --> 00:21:57,440
without including all of them

614
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:00,320
the long message uh has all of the short

615
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:01,600
messages in it

616
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:04,640
it's more uh it has a better flow and it

617
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:07,679
has extra emphasis it talks about all

618
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:08,799
the points

619
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:10,880
to provide a more complete view of what

620
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,159
antoine encryption is

621
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:14,400
we also have a control message which is

622
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,679
there to essentially

623
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:18,080
uh compare to all the other message

624
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:18,880
types

625
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,400
so that we can see if they were

626
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,480
effective or not it just describes

627
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:24,320
non-security features of text like such

628
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:26,080
as you know group chats or how it's

629
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:27,760
great for sending memes and stuff like

630
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:29,360
that

631
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:30,559
all right let's look at some of our

632
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:32,640
short messages uh this is the first one

633
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:34,320
so this is supposed to give an overview

634
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:35,840
of what end to end encryption is it

635
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:36,559
reads

636
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:38,159
messages and text are end-to-end

637
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:40,559
encrypted this ensures that only you and

638
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:42,400
the person you're communicating with

639
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,480
can read the messages you send and

640
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,080
receive

641
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:48,159
nobody in between can see the content of

642
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:49,679
your messages

643
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:51,280
we have another one again this is

644
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:53,440
similar to short v1

645
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,360
before a message ever leaves your device

646
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:56,799
it's secured with a lock

647
00:22:56,799 --> 00:22:58,799
and only you and your recipients have

648
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:00,799
the keys to open the message and read it

649
00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:02,960
again it's just trying to give the same

650
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:05,039
guarantees here

651
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:07,760
all right so before we move into our

652
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:10,080
results we're gonna i want to talk about

653
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:12,159
this plotting scheme that we use pretty

654
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:13,039
often

655
00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:15,600
um first of all we can see that this is

656
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,440
referring to the participants that were

657
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:19,440
in the control group uh so that's the

658
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:19,840
text

659
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:22,400
down below up top we can see which

660
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,240
employ which adversary we're talking

661
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:26,000
about and what capability so in this

662
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,840
case it's the employee adversary so the

663
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,600
malicious employee

664
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:31,760
and their capability of reading or

665
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:33,360
interfering altering

666
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:37,039
altering messages the dots you see here

667
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:37,840
in the graph

668
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:39,600
indicate the differences for each

669
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:40,960
participant again

670
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:43,760
that's the after quiz score minus the

671
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:44,799
before quiz

672
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:47,600
score uh so this one person is right in

673
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:49,360
the middle they didn't change their idea

674
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:52,000
about this adversary capability pair

675
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,159
you can see that the median is the red

676
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:56,400
square it's in the middle here

677
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,960
and this big red arrow shows the

678
00:23:58,960 --> 00:23:59,679
direction

679
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:01,919
we would expect the mental models or we

680
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:04,880
would hope the mental models to shift in

681
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:06,720
so in this case we would want them to

682
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:08,720
shift negative this is the control group

683
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,240
so it just pulls in the middle which is

684
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,559
what you would expect

685
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:14,400
all right let's look at our results well

686
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,320
we see that for the long message

687
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:19,360
indicated with the red box here

688
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:22,000
that it almost always works uh better

689
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,279
than control

690
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:25,919
so over here you can see that we expect

691
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:28,559
the mental models to shift negative

692
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:30,720
and the differences to shift negative

693
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,640
and that's exactly what we see the long

694
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,720
is more it's bulging towards the

695
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:37,360
negative compared to control

696
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:39,840
with medium length messages we see a

697
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:40,720
similar case

698
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:43,360
too long uh it's again better than

699
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:45,279
control the longs here are indicated

700
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:46,080
with the golden

701
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:49,279
box and

702
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:51,279
it's not much worse than long it's

703
00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:54,080
actually pretty comparable to long

704
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:56,960
sometimes the significance levels the

705
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,720
effect sizes aren't as big

706
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:00,640
but it's pretty comparable so it's still

707
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:03,360
shifting negative as we would expect

708
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:05,360
what about the short messages well with

709
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:06,799
some of the short messages there's a

710
00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:09,919
similar case to the mediums

711
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:12,240
for instance with these two short v1 and

712
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:14,320
v4 that we read earlier

713
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:17,279
compared to control it's better and

714
00:25:17,279 --> 00:25:19,039
they're not much worse than long

715
00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:21,360
it's still shifting negative which is

716
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:22,320
great

717
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:25,360
we also see that short v1 and v4

718
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:28,320
uh indicated here they outperform some

719
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,919
of the other messages because they give

720
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:30,640
a more

721
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:33,520
general overview they outperform them

722
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:34,159
just

723
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:37,440
in a general sense we see that when we

724
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:38,080
talk about

725
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:41,200
specific address theories and the

726
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:43,279
is topical to this adversary or this

727
00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:44,320
capability

728
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:47,360
um that the short messages can

729
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:49,440
outperform all the other message

730
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:52,400
versions uh for instance short v2 here

731
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:53,760
and short v3

732
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:56,080
uh they target specific battery series

733
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:58,480
and capabilities short v2 was targeting

734
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:01,200
uh the metadata uh capability and short

735
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:03,120
v3 was talking about the endpoint

736
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:04,000
adversaries

737
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,080
which is what malware is if it's on your

738
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:07,440
phone

739
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:08,880
you can see they're both shifting

740
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:10,960
positive which is what we would expect

741
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:14,240
as you can tell from the arrow direction

742
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:16,080
now there is some additional risk of

743
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:18,240
over correcting and we see that in our

744
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:20,720
in our results this is not only true for

745
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:21,440
shorts

746
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:24,080
but also for longs and mids you can see

747
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:26,159
that these two are kind of

748
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:27,840
sort of the short view ones highlighted

749
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:29,760
here with the blue are kind of shifting

750
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:30,720
towards the

751
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:33,039
negative but we would expect we would

752
00:26:33,039 --> 00:26:34,960
want it to shift positive

753
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:36,480
which is not great we need to take care

754
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:38,880
of that okay what are our takeaways from

755
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:41,760
study two well it's that the messages

756
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:43,840
work in a controlled environment so

757
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:46,880
quiz show the messages quiz again uh

758
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:48,559
it's very controlled there aren't many

759
00:26:48,559 --> 00:26:51,679
external factors the messages work great

760
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:53,360
we see that the short messages work

761
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:55,200
surprisingly well especially when

762
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,640
they're topical when they're referring

763
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:00,080
to a specific adversary or capability

764
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:01,679
we can we think we can show these

765
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:03,679
messages one by one in order to not

766
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:06,640
overwhelm users just easily integrate it

767
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:09,120
into the ui of an application

768
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:11,600
and this would also because we're

769
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:13,360
showing all the messages it would form a

770
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:14,880
complete mental model

771
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:16,960
right so we're done with the survey

772
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:18,960
study now we're going to move on to the

773
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:20,399
field study which is the last study

774
00:27:20,399 --> 00:27:23,520
we're going to talk about today

775
00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:25,840
so the results again from study two they

776
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:29,440
feel it directly into study three

777
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:31,120
are the questions we're asking about

778
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:32,799
here is how well

779
00:27:32,799 --> 00:27:34,880
what messages we've identified from

780
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:36,159
study to

781
00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:39,279
integrate into the application work in

782
00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:42,000
the real world

783
00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:45,520
we are also interested in going after

784
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:46,720
why these messages

785
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:48,799
might work in an application why it

786
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:50,159
might not

787
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:51,840
and how we can improve it further

788
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:53,840
perhaps okay

789
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:56,159
so here's what our setup looks like for

790
00:27:56,159 --> 00:27:57,919
study three

791
00:27:57,919 --> 00:27:59,840
we incorporate successful messages from

792
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:02,240
the online study into the app

793
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:06,159
you can see a short message integrated

794
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:08,480
in the screenshot to your right well you

795
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:09,919
don't have to read the message

796
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:12,640
it's in the blue box we read it earlier

797
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,080
it's the same message

798
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:16,000
when you click on it opens the long

799
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,760
message again you don't have to read it

800
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:19,360
it's it contains the messages from

801
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:20,159
earlier

802
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:22,799
uh and in order to integrate uh these

803
00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:24,720
messages into an end to an encrypted app

804
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:25,919
we actually

805
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:28,240
we modify signal we rebrand it so this

806
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:30,559
is what signal looks like on the google

807
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:31,520
play store

808
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:33,840
uh without any modifications and this is

809
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:35,840
what text light looks like so it's quite

810
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:37,440
different again this is done

811
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:40,320
to remove any brand bias this is by no

812
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:40,799
means

813
00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:43,600
intended to be a product we're just uh

814
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:44,159
trying

815
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:46,960
to come up with something for our

816
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:48,960
experiment uh in fact it's not on google

817
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,880
play anymore

818
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:53,360
all right so we also develop a control

819
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:55,120
version of the application

820
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:58,799
uh which is there so that we can compare

821
00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:00,559
the experimental group to something and

822
00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:03,600
see the changes in mental models

823
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:05,679
we ask our participants to use the app

824
00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:06,880
for three weeks

825
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:09,600
they do short texting sessions daily

826
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:11,279
with a researcher although they don't

827
00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:13,840
really know that

828
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:16,559
we measure the changes in mental models

829
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:18,720
of encryption just like in study two so

830
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:21,200
quiz before and after

831
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:23,279
so from the participants point of view

832
00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:24,720
this is what it looks like

833
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:27,200
they would be introduced to text light

834
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:28,720
and be told that it's end-to-end

835
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:29,520
encrypted

836
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:32,320
they would be quizzed about certain

837
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:34,720
address series and capabilities

838
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:37,200
then they would remotely install text

839
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:38,000
lite

840
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:41,279
register to it they would use it for a

841
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:42,799
daily chat they would

842
00:29:42,799 --> 00:29:45,600
send messages back and forth every day

843
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:46,480
and then

844
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:49,120
after 20 days about three weeks they

845
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:49,840
would take an

846
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:51,520
exit survey which is again the same

847
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:53,600
adversary capability questions

848
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:55,679
and we would optionally interview uh

849
00:29:55,679 --> 00:29:57,360
some of our participants

850
00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:00,480
from the experimental group and that's

851
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:01,919
it for the participants

852
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:04,799
uh well how did the experiment go well

853
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:07,440
we had 61 participants and 32 of them

854
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:09,360
were in the experimental group

855
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:11,120
the rest of them were in control as

856
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:12,480
expected

857
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:14,640
we see that there is no usability

858
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:16,080
difference reported when we try to

859
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:19,120
measure the usability of the application

860
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:20,960
this just means that the messages we've

861
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:22,720
added about entering encryption didn't

862
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:23,840
change the usability

863
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:25,360
or at least we couldn't measure any

864
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:26,960
difference

865
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:30,000
participants used the app on average uh

866
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,320
about 18 and a half days the median was

867
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:33,120
20 so

868
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:34,880
almost everyone used it during the

869
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:37,200
entire duration every day

870
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:39,679
on average one participant during the

871
00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:40,960
entire three weeks

872
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:44,320
spent 2.6 hours just looking at the app

873
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:46,240
the standard deviation is quite high so

874
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:48,080
some people spent 10 hours some people

875
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:50,320
spent one

876
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:52,000
our participants were required to send

877
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
about 100 messages and they ended up

878
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,360
saying about

879
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:59,360
sending about 138 on average

880
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:01,840
so they did more than that was expected

881
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:02,720
from them

882
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:06,000
all right let's move into our results

883
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,480
we see that statistically unlike in the

884
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:10,080
survey study there's no

885
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:11,679
almost no difference between the

886
00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:15,600
experimental and the control groups

887
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:17,279
although there's more to say about this

888
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:18,799
it's kind of similar to what we see in

889
00:31:18,799 --> 00:31:19,679
the survey study

890
00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:22,320
in some aspects the interviews also tell

891
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:24,000
us more about this

892
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,880
now this is all of our results the grays

893
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:28,159
are the control group

894
00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:29,760
the brownish red colors are the

895
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:31,200
experimental you see them as

896
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:34,000
in pairs and you see that almost all the

897
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
pairs are basically the same shapes the

898
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
same lines

899
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
except these three right here let's

900
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:43,279
compare these to the survey study

901
00:31:43,279 --> 00:31:46,559
so here i put the graphs about the same

902
00:31:46,559 --> 00:31:48,159
adversary capabilities

903
00:31:48,159 --> 00:31:51,279
uh in the survey uh to the right and

904
00:31:51,279 --> 00:31:53,600
from the app study uh to the left with

905
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:56,159
the purples

906
00:31:56,159 --> 00:31:58,080
first let's talk about the top four up

907
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:00,320
top here so

908
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:02,720
note that the direction we expect mental

909
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,640
models to shift is negative here

910
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:06,240
we see that the employee and the

911
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:07,840
government address series

912
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:10,640
uh with interception or you know being

913
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:11,919
able to read messages

914
00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:13,360
it's shifting in the right direction

915
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:15,840
just like in the survey study

916
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:17,519
what's interesting here is that these

917
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:19,279
address series show the biggest effect

918
00:32:19,279 --> 00:32:21,200
sizes from the survey study

919
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:22,880
which just means that these were the

920
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:24,640
easiest to learn about in the survey

921
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:25,120
study

922
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:27,039
and that kind of makes sense that this

923
00:32:27,039 --> 00:32:29,600
effect that was the easy it was easiest

924
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:31,039
to learn the survey study and people

925
00:32:31,039 --> 00:32:33,120
also learned it um

926
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:36,240
in the app study looking at the plots

927
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:37,360
down below here

928
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:39,279
uh this time the arrow direction is

929
00:32:39,279 --> 00:32:40,799
reversed so we're talking about the

930
00:32:40,799 --> 00:32:41,679
metadata

931
00:32:41,679 --> 00:32:43,440
and 200 encryption isn't that great

932
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:44,960
against metadata

933
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:47,279
so we would expect these mental models

934
00:32:47,279 --> 00:32:48,640
to shift positive

935
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,720
but they shift the wrong way and this is

936
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:52,559
again similar to the survey study

937
00:32:52,559 --> 00:32:56,559
we try to not fall into this

938
00:32:56,559 --> 00:32:59,600
uh this pit of overselling security

939
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:02,960
but uh unfortunately we do uh and again

940
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:03,679
you can see

941
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:05,840
the long message in the survey study the

942
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:07,519
brown one is kind of shifting towards

943
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:08,399
the negative

944
00:33:08,399 --> 00:33:11,039
uh and so is the experimental version in

945
00:33:11,039 --> 00:33:12,720
the metadata

946
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:15,840
oh sorry in the app study all right

947
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:17,360
what about the interviews well we

948
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:19,840
interviewed 19 out of 32 experimental

949
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:21,200
participants

950
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:23,519
and 10 out of 19 participants were able

951
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:25,120
to generalize the concept of end-to-end

952
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:26,720
encryption to some degree

953
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:28,640
for instance this person said it

954
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:30,720
protects from probably anyone who would

955
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:31,360
interrupt

956
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:33,919
or interfere in between the messaging in

957
00:33:33,919 --> 00:33:35,919
between where you sent it and someone

958
00:33:35,919 --> 00:33:39,840
else received it

959
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:43,360
uh we see that 14 out of 19 participants

960
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:45,679
knew the unlocked phone and this is just

961
00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:47,919
someone having access to your phone

962
00:33:47,919 --> 00:33:50,559
which is unlocked they they knew that

963
00:33:50,559 --> 00:33:52,799
this advertiser was quite powerful

964
00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:56,080
which is great we see that nine out of

965
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:58,159
19 so almost half of our participants

966
00:33:58,159 --> 00:33:59,679
got at least something wrong about

967
00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:01,120
end-to-end encryption

968
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:03,600
for instance uh this person said it

969
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:05,519
protects from people hacking into your

970
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:07,279
phone from either reading the messages

971
00:34:07,279 --> 00:34:09,040
or altering the contents of the message

972
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:10,960
so this person is clearly confused about

973
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:12,399
other capabilities of entertainment

974
00:34:12,399 --> 00:34:13,119
encryption

975
00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:15,440
if the endpoint is compromised uh say

976
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:17,440
with with a malware on your phone

977
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:19,199
uh then enter an encryption can't do

978
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:20,879
much against it

979
00:34:20,879 --> 00:34:23,440
we see that again the same number of

980
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:24,639
participants

981
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:26,639
said they didn't read the messages or

982
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:28,399
they simply weren't interested in these

983
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:30,079
messages

984
00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:32,800
this person voiced it with say by saying

985
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:33,119
i

986
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:34,800
obviously didn't pay a lot of attention

987
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:36,800
to it

988
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:38,639
all right what are our takeaways here

989
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:40,399
well statistically there are no

990
00:34:40,399 --> 00:34:42,320
significant changes in mental models

991
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:44,480
but we see that the strongest effect

992
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:46,239
sizes so the things that are easiest to

993
00:34:46,239 --> 00:34:48,000
learn about in the survey study

994
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,918
they show they themselves in the app

995
00:34:49,918 --> 00:34:51,280
study as well uh

996
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:54,639
we see there are some overselling um

997
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:57,520
what anton encryption can provide and uh

998
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:59,359
we also see that some participants had

999
00:34:59,359 --> 00:35:01,119
decent mental models when we interviewed

1000
00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:03,359
them when we talk to them

1001
00:35:03,359 --> 00:35:05,680
we think messages might have to be made

1002
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:07,920
more obvious

1003
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:10,160
this is uh even if this means

1004
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:11,920
sacrificing usability a bit

1005
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:15,040
we think this because some of our users

1006
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:17,440
in fact almost half of our users simply

1007
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:19,680
ignored the messages

1008
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:21,200
all right so those are our takeaways

1009
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:22,880
from study three

1010
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:25,920
to sum up the entire presentation what

1011
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:26,560
we

1012
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:28,720
know is mental models of secure

1013
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:30,320
communications especially end-to-end

1014
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:31,359
encrypted ones

1015
00:35:31,359 --> 00:35:33,680
are not functional enough people have

1016
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:35,040
misconceptions

1017
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:36,560
and uh they can't make adequate

1018
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:39,119
decisions because of this

1019
00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:41,599
we investigate if small nudges that are

1020
00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:42,240
easily

1021
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:44,640
integrated into existing systems and

1022
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:46,400
user-centered design

1023
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:49,839
can improve things user-centered design

1024
00:35:49,839 --> 00:35:51,680
is again just basically

1025
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:54,720
involving participants in the process

1026
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:59,040
and we think it maybe can

1027
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:01,520
our initial qualitative study was done

1028
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:03,520
to identify topics and messages that

1029
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:06,240
users might be interested in and think

1030
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:08,320
are worth learning about

1031
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:10,800
we conducted an online study to examine

1032
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:12,560
messages that we specifically craft

1033
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:14,000
based on study one

1034
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:17,200
and we design a study that's done over a

1035
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:19,440
period to test real world effectiveness

1036
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:21,200
of these messages

1037
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:23,680
we identify these key items to teach

1038
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:24,240
users

1039
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:27,359
in study one we see that

1040
00:36:27,359 --> 00:36:29,280
what in a controlled environment these

1041
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:30,720
messages work well

1042
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:32,640
about end-to-end encryption they do

1043
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:34,720
change mental models

1044
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:37,440
and we see that integration uh into

1045
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:39,359
applications might need to be more

1046
00:36:39,359 --> 00:36:41,280
obvious

1047
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:43,520
perhaps by sacrificing usability a bit

1048
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:44,800
because again

1049
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:47,680
some users signal simply uh ignore these

1050
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:51,119
messages about internal encryption

1051
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:53,760
all right so with that uh that'll be the

1052
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:55,359
end of my presentation

1053
