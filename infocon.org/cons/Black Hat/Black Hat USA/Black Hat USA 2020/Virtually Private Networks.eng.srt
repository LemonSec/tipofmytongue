2
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:17,520
well hello everyone

3
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,840
my name is charlton avaltz i'm joined

4
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:22,080
today by my colleague vickers ross

5
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:24,160
we are both researchers for orange cyber

6
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:26,080
defence which is the cyber security

7
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:26,640
division

8
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,160
of orange mobile we greet you today from

9
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:33,200
the beautiful city of cape town which is

10
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,719
in south africa

11
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:36,880
uh please take a moment to follow us on

12
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:38,320
twitter our handles at the bottom of the

13
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:39,760
page

14
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:42,800
vickers knows something about almost

15
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,719
everything and i

16
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:48,239
know vekus but we really appreciate you

17
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:52,718
reaching out and linking up online

18
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:56,399
so research is really the

19
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:59,680
story of how we seek answers to

20
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:02,960
questions and the story we want to tell

21
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:03,520
you about

22
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:06,240
today is how we've been trying to

23
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,400
discover the answer to the question

24
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,920
do vpn technologies actually work

25
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:14,240
and we'll not be talking today about

26
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,000
bugs or vulnerabilities in specific

27
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,200
technologies

28
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,439
but really examining the question of

29
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:22,479
whether a specific class of technologies

30
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:24,840
provides the kind of protection that we

31
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,479
expect

32
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:29,200
in a scenario that we believe is common

33
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,960
used in a way that we believe is common

34
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,400
and from places that we

35
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,360
believe is common

36
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:39,600
and our story has a lot to do with

37
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:40,240
travel

38
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:42,560
as professionals and like many of you

39
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,720
vicus and i spend a lot of time

40
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:47,680
traveling in fact if you live as far

41
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:48,640
away from

42
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:51,200
everything as we do you pretty much have

43
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,399
to get on a plane

44
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:54,799
just to get a mcdonald's so we spend a

45
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:55,840
lot of time

46
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:58,159
flying and if you spend a lot of time

47
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:00,640
flying like i'm sure many of you do

48
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:03,920
then you also encounter this a lot

49
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:07,360
it's free wi-fi in fact i think we all

50
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,479
know how it works

51
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:11,920
as soon as you get off the plane first

52
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,599
thing you need is a toilet

53
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:15,040
the next thing you need is a coffee and

54
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,959
then right after that it's

55
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:20,480
free wi-fi except as we know

56
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:23,120
the public wi-fi that we use is almost

57
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,160
never

58
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:26,319
actually free there's always some kind

59
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:28,000
of transaction involved

60
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,640
you either have to pay i suppose then

61
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:31,680
it's not free

62
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,760
or you have to provide some personal

63
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,120
information or at very

64
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,680
least you need to accept the terms and

65
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,800
conditions that this

66
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:42,319
access point demands from you

67
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:43,440
and so we interact with something that's

68
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,120
called the captive portal we all know

69
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,400
what i'm talking about

70
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,480
captive portal is that web application

71
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,000
where you're asked to provide some

72
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,440
information about yourself accept the

73
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:52,879
terms and conditions

74
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:56,480
uh perhaps into some credit card details

75
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,400
but whatever the case is there's a

76
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,080
transaction happening and it's being

77
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,080
facilitated by this

78
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,760
by this technology the captive portal

79
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:06,319
technology and the word that i want to

80
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:09,120
focus you on is that word captive

81
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,560
because it really captures a lot of what

82
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,800
we'll be talking about today the captive

83
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,080
portal puts you in this

84
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:17,599
kind of weird purgatory state where

85
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:20,080
you're sitting between a space where

86
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,159
you've connected to the wi-fi lan

87
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:24,080
you've got network settings your machine

88
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,840
believes it's connected

89
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:28,159
but in fact you don't have access to the

90
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:30,560
internet and you're in this in-between

91
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,560
state that we'll we'll be referring to

92
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:33,599
as captured

93
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:35,440
so bear that in mind as as you listen to

94
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:38,560
the rest of our presentation

95
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,640
and it creates all kinds of weird

96
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:41,680
scenarios

97
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,440
so what you're seeing here is a

98
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:46,640
screenshot of a typical windows machine

99
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,560
that has in found itself in this

100
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,400
captured state between connecting to the

101
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,440
wi-fi network

102
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:54,000
and being on the internet and the

103
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:54,959
dialogues you're seeing

104
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:56,640
all the sort of windows gadgets and

105
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,400
widgets and applications and browser

106
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,439
tabs

107
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:02,959
going crazy because they are connecting

108
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:03,599
to

109
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:06,000
a server that's presenting the wrong ssl

110
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:06,959
certificate

111
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:08,159
and that's happening of course because

112
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:10,000
the captive portal has redirected that

113
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:10,720
traffic

114
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,319
to itself it's serving its own

115
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:14,000
certificates and applications

116
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,519
have recognized that that certificate is

117
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:18,000
not correct

118
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,600
as a sort of curious aside one of the

119
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:22,000
things that i find relatively amusing is

120
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,080
how readily and desperately these

121
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,759
applications want you to accept that

122
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:26,560
state

123
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,560
by giving you that yes accept connect

124
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,000
proceed button

125
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,320
i was particularly amused by zoom who

126
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,199
make their button

127
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:35,120
big and blue and bold so you can hardly

128
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:38,160
miss it but also by that vpn provider on

129
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,440
the bottom right there

130
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:42,000
who not only invites you to connect but

131
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,280
also invites you to remember that

132
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:44,880
setting so that you can

133
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:47,199
continue connecting to the wrong vpn

134
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:48,400
server

135
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:51,040
forever without any inconvenience but

136
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:51,680
this is just

137
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,800
one example of the sort of curious state

138
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,000
that captive portal puts

139
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,320
us in this one is a little harder to

140
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,040
grasp

141
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:02,639
but it involves the dhcp settings that

142
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:03,440
are

143
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:07,039
sent by the wi-fi ap to your uh to your

144
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:09,440
endpoint and we we know what happens

145
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,440
with dhcp it's all the typical things

146
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,639
you get given your ip address your

147
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:14,800
subnet mask default routes

148
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,039
dns servers but i want to draw your

149
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:19,039
attention to this other setting here

150
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:20,240
also which is the

151
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:24,320
domain search suffix option 15 i think

152
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:27,520
um and you'll note that what the search

153
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,199
suffix is used for

154
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:31,440
is when your machine tries to access a

155
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,639
resource

156
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:35,120
on the network via a name that's not

157
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,960
fully qualified in other words

158
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,800
the first part of the dns name and not

159
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,120
the back end of the dns name

160
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:44,080
then this search suffix will be appended

161
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:44,560
to

162
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,479
the name that you entered and that will

163
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:48,960
be used to resolve dns and

164
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,840
provide you with an ip address in the

165
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:52,160
end

166
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:55,440
and where that becomes problematic

167
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:58,880
is what we'll see in the next uh example

168
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:01,600
is when the the asset that you're

169
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,360
accessing

170
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,759
is being accessed by a name which is not

171
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:06,639
qualified

172
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:08,240
and in this example what you're seeing

173
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,759
is a user connecting to

174
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:11,520
a printer a corporate printer called

175
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,039
printer hq

176
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:15,840
that printer is captured in their config

177
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:18,319
without a fully qualified domain name

178
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:20,400
now those without the end bit and so

179
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,440
what's happening is

180
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:24,880
the um the stack is adding that dna

181
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:28,240
suffix to the end and resolving that

182
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,919
and what ends up happening in this case

183
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:32,560
is that that fully qualified name

184
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,960
does get resolved results in an ip

185
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,800
address which is an entirely different

186
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:37,600
place

187
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,280
in this case an ip address on the on the

188
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,520
internet and vicus will go into this in

189
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:42,560
more detail but i think

190
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,919
you can start to understand why that

191
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:47,280
could be problematic

192
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:50,560
and the what what these examples led us

193
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,199
to in our

194
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:53,360
in our story is to start asking the

195
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,960
question uh what

196
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:57,120
is the role that the vpn technology

197
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,000
should play

198
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,960
in a scenario like like this because

199
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,000
notionally it would

200
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,639
it would seem to us that in establishing

201
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:06,400
this you know this encrypted and secure

202
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:06,880
tunnel

203
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:09,680
between the end user and the corporate

204
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,199
network

205
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:13,599
what we expect is a kind of a network

206
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:14,960
and security

207
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:18,720
equivalency where the the set of network

208
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,479
conditions and security conditions

209
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:24,319
that a user on the wi-fi lan

210
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:26,880
experience should be equivalent to what

211
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:27,680
a user

212
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,440
connected to the corporate land should

213
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,919
experience that that in our mind is

214
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:34,960
is notionally the expectation that a vpn

215
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:37,039
creates and it's that notional

216
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:38,560
expectation that we want to

217
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:41,680
test in our research and that

218
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,280
network and security equivalency is

219
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,960
achieved by the vpn

220
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,680
by providing three things it's

221
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,080
confidentiality

222
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:52,800
integrity and access control

223
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,440
so diving in to a little more detail

224
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,520
about the the research we will be

225
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:58,879
presenting today

226
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:00,319
uh the first thing i need to just touch

227
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:02,000
on very briefly is some of the

228
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,680
assumptions that we're that we're

229
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,039
working from

230
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:06,879
um and we're going to these in a lot

231
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:08,960
more detail on the website that we've

232
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,639
created for this research but just very

233
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:12,000
quickly

234
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,280
we're proceeding from the assumption

235
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,840
that working from home via wi-fi

236
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:18,479
is is common and under covert 19 you

237
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:19,840
know we think that's a safe assumption

238
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:20,800
to make

239
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,039
um in normal life when we're all

240
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:26,160
traveling around we believe that working

241
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,840
via wi-fi access points that have

242
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,919
captive portals is common that's a

243
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:32,000
scenario you encounter

244
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,279
on a daily basis and it's growing

245
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:37,679
we believe that home routers and that

246
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:39,599
kind of home router technology stack

247
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:43,599
is uh can be expected to be insecure or

248
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:44,880
at least purely con

249
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,959
poorly configured it's not a technology

250
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:48,320
that we have control over like we have

251
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,640
control over our corporate technologies

252
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,839
we believe those kinds of technologies

253
00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:54,560
are

254
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:57,200
frequently talk targeted we've seen

255
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,200
examples of that mirai the morai botnet

256
00:08:59,200 --> 00:08:59,680
being

257
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:02,480
the most recent example and we believe

258
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,760
that when vpns

259
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:07,040
are are deployed in corporates it's

260
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,800
it's common practice for those vpns to

261
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,959
use split tunneling uh which v

262
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:12,160
vicus will go into a little bit more

263
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,080
detail i just want to make one more

264
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,519
point here which is that

265
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:18,000
although our story started off by us

266
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,160
examining the scenario of the captive

267
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,200
portal

268
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,959
it soon became clear to us that there's

269
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:24,959
actually at a theoretical level

270
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:27,680
no difference between a captive portal

271
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,440
which is built for that purpose

272
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:32,720
and a and a home router wi-fi ap that's

273
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:35,680
been compromised and is

274
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,360
reconfigured to act in the same way as a

275
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,800
captive portal so

276
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,240
when we talk about captive portals and

277
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,000
we talk about home routers

278
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,440
that have been compromised we're talking

279
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,279
kind of about the same thing so it's

280
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:47,440
either compromised or malicious

281
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:51,440
wi-fi access points

282
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:54,560
and then given that scenario we want to

283
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,000
argue that there are

284
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,360
six specific technical threats that we

285
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,440
believe a vpn should be able to protect

286
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,279
us against

287
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:04,880
obviously other scenarios but these are

288
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,720
the six specific scenarios

289
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:09,120
uh that we identified for our research

290
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,200
and which our results will be based on

291
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,440
uh the first is that we think the vpn

292
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,519
should prevent sniffing

293
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:17,279
from happening an attacker should not be

294
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:19,200
able to glean information

295
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,600
on the network about your host because

296
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,800
of this tunnel that's supposed to

297
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:23,279
protect

298
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:25,839
us secondly we think the vpn should

299
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:27,120
protect us from

300
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:30,560
sort of dns meddling attacks right when

301
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:31,120
you

302
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:34,720
send out a request for a dns name to be

303
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:35,600
resolved

304
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:38,000
the response that you get when you're

305
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,200
sitting in that

306
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,120
on that wi-fi ap and using the vpn

307
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,320
should be the same

308
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,079
as the response that you expect to get

309
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:45,600
if you were sitting in the corporate

310
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:48,399
network and if that's not the same then

311
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:49,760
then we failed on that

312
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:52,720
uh in that scenario uh thirdly we

313
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,320
believe the vpn should be protecting us

314
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:54,880
against

315
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,800
kind of spoofed websites websites for

316
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,480
phishing um

317
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,640
any kind of meddling with a web

318
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:03,120
interface that happens between the user

319
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,160
and the corporate

320
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,800
network and again the the the litmus

321
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,480
test here is equivalency

322
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:11,120
we're not talking about uh spoofing

323
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,079
sites

324
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:14,560
that occur once use is broken out onto

325
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:15,680
the internet

326
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,680
um we're talking about scenarios that

327
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,600
are possible because the user is in this

328
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,279
wi-fi

329
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:23,519
state on this wi-fi network and not on

330
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:26,560
the on the vpn

331
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:29,920
we think there's a very real risk of

332
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:33,040
responder attacks um being launched in

333
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:33,360
this

334
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:36,240
scenario and so we want to test and

335
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,120
ensure

336
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:39,440
verify that a user who's connected to

337
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,120
this remote lan

338
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:44,720
is not more susceptible to smb responder

339
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:45,680
type attacks

340
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,440
than a user that's sitting in your

341
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,120
private network

342
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:51,680
we want to ensure we want to test that

343
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:52,800
the

344
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:55,200
interaction with the with the captive

345
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,279
portal doesn't introduce the

346
00:11:57,279 --> 00:11:58,880
opportunity for an attacker to inject

347
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:01,279
malicious javascript into the browser

348
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:03,200
and therefore repurpose the browser into

349
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,800
some sort of attack tool

350
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,880
typically for example tunneling via the

351
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:09,440
browser into the corporate network

352
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,360
and then finally we want to examine the

353
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,600
role that ipv6 plays

354
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:17,519
in this captured state and

355
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:20,639
we would expect that a host that is

356
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:23,279
on a wi-fi network should not be more

357
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:24,000
susceptible

358
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,560
to attacks or interaction with its ipv6

359
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:27,120
stack

360
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,480
than a host that's on the corporate

361
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,800
network so those are the six

362
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,320
specific threat scenarios that we're

363
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,760
interested in examining and those are

364
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:34,079
the

365
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:35,760
scenarios that our tests will be based

366
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,279
on

367
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:38,639
in terms of an approach we don't have to

368
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:40,720
go into this in in too much detail

369
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,800
but basically what we wanted to do was

370
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,320
create a standard set of

371
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:46,560
scenarios and a standard set of tests

372
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:49,279
and repeat those tests against a range

373
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:50,160
of

374
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:53,440
significant vendors in this space

375
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,600
we have at this point that we're

376
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:56,959
recording this video

377
00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:00,399
we've identified cisco pulse checkpoint

378
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:03,600
fortinet and polo ultra networks

379
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:07,040
our our goal is to expand that over time

380
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:10,000
and so again we would we would ask you

381
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,839
to visit our website we will be keeping

382
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:14,160
this research updated

383
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,000
and effectively what we want to do is

384
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,279
identify

385
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:19,360
standard equivalent configurations

386
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,959
across these

387
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:23,680
vendors that we can compare with each

388
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:24,399
other

389
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:26,399
in the context of those six threat

390
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:27,680
scenarios that

391
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:30,959
that we identified once again

392
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:34,240
here it is big and bold uh our most

393
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:37,120
current data will be reported on our

394
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:39,120
website we're recording this

395
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,760
some time before you will be watching it

396
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:42,160
so

397
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:43,519
if you if you want the updated

398
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:45,199
information please take a moment to

399
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:46,160
visit the site

400
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,920
i will also be sharing other resources

401
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:50,000
videos examples pcaps

402
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,079
those sorts of things there you can take

403
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:53,199
a photo

404
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:56,959
of your computer screen and so

405
00:13:56,959 --> 00:13:59,199
finally before i hand over to vickers in

406
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:00,880
terms of summarizing the

407
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:02,240
the research question that we're looking

408
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:04,160
to answer today

409
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:06,800
what we're saying is that if the vpn can

410
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,399
be considered the logical

411
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:10,399
extension of the private network to

412
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:12,320
another location

413
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,480
if we expect if it's reasonable for us

414
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:15,519
to expect network

415
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:18,320
and security equivalency when the vpn is

416
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,360
established

417
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,120
and if we assume that that other

418
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,880
location is a wi-fi network that's

419
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:25,199
either malicious or compromised

420
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:26,720
then the question we're trying to answer

421
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:28,399
is how much protection

422
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:31,360
do these vpn is enterprise vpn

423
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:32,959
technologies provide

424
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:35,279
against the common and realistic threats

425
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:36,959
that we think we would expect

426
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:40,639
to encounter today and with that

427
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:43,199
i'm going to hand over to my colleague

428
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:45,839
vickers ross

429
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:48,800
thank you sean and let's now dive a bit

430
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,480
into the technical concepts that's

431
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:51,839
pertinent to this

432
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:54,160
research let's start off looking at

433
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:55,920
captive portals

434
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:58,320
captive portal can be described as a

435
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,519
very simple

436
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:01,680
piece of setup kit typically like an

437
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:02,720
access point

438
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:05,920
a router with wi-fi a firewall and maybe

439
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:06,959
a website

440
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:10,639
on it now charles described scenarios

441
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:11,600
earlier on how

442
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:12,880
you would interact with the capital

443
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:15,120
portal but let's look at it a little bit

444
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:15,680
deeper

445
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:19,120
in a technical context after your wi-fi

446
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:21,680
after your device connected to the wi-fi

447
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:24,320
you would typically require dhcp

448
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:26,000
configuration or network configuration

449
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,120
and this is provided by the dhcp service

450
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:32,720
hosted on the captive portal the

451
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:35,199
next part is the operating system on

452
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:36,000
your device

453
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,480
will try and determine whether or not it

454
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,160
has internet access

455
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:42,880
that internet access test resolves it

456
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:45,440
basically requires it resolving a url

457
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,680
and getting a response from it before

458
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,680
you can get the url it needs to have the

459
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:50,320
dns

460
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:53,120
settings resolved of the host interested

461
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:56,079
in so it uses basically the dns

462
00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:58,800
server of the captive portal to get an

463
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,079
ip address

464
00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:02,240
this app ip address is now used to do an

465
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,279
http

466
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:05,519
request and this is where the captive

467
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:06,880
portal actually starts

468
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:09,519
meddling with this whole process it

469
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:10,720
effectively

470
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:13,920
intercepts that http request and

471
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:16,399
it presents a response and http response

472
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:17,519
back with a

473
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:20,639
status code of 302 meaning temporarily

474
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:22,639
moved somewhere else and it provides a

475
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:23,839
new location

476
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:26,480
for this website as being the capital

477
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:27,839
portals website

478
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:30,320
the os detects that this shenanigans is

479
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,079
going on and it realizes well i was

480
00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:33,600
testing whether or not we're behind the

481
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:34,880
captive portal so

482
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:37,440
this is probably indicative that we are

483
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:38,639
it will then

484
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:41,040
launch a browser which it presents the

485
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,480
captive portal interface

486
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:45,519
to to you as the user on the device

487
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:47,440
you now have to satisfy the captive

488
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,880
portal

489
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:51,040
questions accept terms and conditions

490
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:53,120
and then if the capital portal is happy

491
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:56,000
allows you internet access so now your

492
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,600
operating system

493
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,279
knows it's online because while you're

494
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:01,040
trying to resolve this capped portal

495
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:01,759
state

496
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:04,480
it literally hammers that same request

497
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:05,359
over and over until

498
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:07,039
it sees well connections are being

499
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:10,000
accepted and i'm happy with the response

500
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,319
so let's look at the next concept which

501
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:15,199
is important is the dhcp aspect that we

502
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:17,359
encountered earlier in this capture

503
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:18,480
portal state

504
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,720
dhcp is important here because that's

505
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,720
probably one of the first

506
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:24,720
packets that gets broadcast by your

507
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,160
client when it reaches

508
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:29,360
the captive portal wi-fi the

509
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:32,320
device on your side asks for a dhcp

510
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:34,000
service to provide it with certain

511
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,120
options

512
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:36,960
at the same time it divulges some

513
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,799
information about itself

514
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:41,760
the capital portal service dha dhcp

515
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:42,559
service

516
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:45,360
responds back saying oh by the way here

517
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:46,799
are the options you're looking for

518
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:48,400
and this includes important information

519
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,919
like your ip address

520
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:52,720
dna servers and here's the mo important

521
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:53,360
part of

522
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:55,760
protein and for our research being the

523
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:56,640
domain name

524
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:59,440
and the dna search suffixes options 15

525
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:00,600
and options

526
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:04,000
119 which all indicated to earlier

527
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,559
those dna suffixes are important when

528
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:07,840
trying to resolve

529
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:11,120
unqualified domain domain names

530
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:12,559
and we'll see how that plays out a

531
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:14,320
little bit later other information

532
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:15,280
provided includes

533
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:18,240
mtu's routing etc it's quite a rich set

534
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:21,039
of options available to us

535
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:24,000
next let's look at vpn tunneling

536
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,760
configurations

537
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:28,640
we'll probably see two most pertinent

538
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:29,440
ones being

539
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:31,440
split tunneling and full tunneling and

540
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:32,880
i'm going to go out on the limia saying

541
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,240
that split tunneling is probably the

542
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:35,360
most

543
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:38,480
dominant configuration set out there but

544
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:42,080
it's not the only one split tunneling

545
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:44,480
you're probably all familiar with you in

546
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:45,440
information or

547
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:47,360
packets or traffic directed at the

548
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:49,760
corporate land goes over the vpn

549
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:52,000
and all the other traffic goes directly

550
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,280
to the internet

551
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:55,520
full tunneling as it suggests all the

552
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:57,600
traffic goes to the vpn

553
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:00,080
uh server on the corporate land side and

554
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,120
at that point

555
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:04,240
the policies and routing rules apply

556
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:06,559
as the corporate uh dictates so it might

557
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:08,240
even allow internet traffic to be routed

558
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:09,679
back out into the internet

559
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:11,520
so that's the important concept to

560
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:14,480
understand as well

561
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:17,840
next is the role that ip6 plays

562
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:20,080
in captive portals it's not that common

563
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:20,880
at this stage

564
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,720
but we believe it is becoming more and

565
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:24,799
more more and more common

566
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:28,320
ipv6 is a very chatty protocol uh unlike

567
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:31,760
ipv4 ipv6 relies on neighbor

568
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:34,720
solicitation and root acceleration

569
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,960
elicitation

570
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,960
packets to be broadcasted and it gathers

571
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:41,200
information that way

572
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,679
so it fills the space where arp would

573
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:44,640
normally play

574
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:47,840
that role for us ipv6 can also be

575
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:51,280
configured using dhcp v6

576
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:54,480
which has the similar type of dna suffix

577
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,480
options available to it and then there

578
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,240
are all sorts of other options also

579
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,200
available to us

580
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:02,720
but ipv6 typically is seldomly

581
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:05,840
considered in security configurations up

582
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:06,720
front it

583
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,960
tends to become a question later down

584
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:11,200
the line so that's why we included ipv6

585
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,840
as a consideration

586
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:16,720
another interesting topic is captive

587
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:17,520
portal

588
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,919
lockdown configuration or sometimes

589
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:21,039
referred to as

590
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:24,000
mitigation mode these are a set of

591
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:24,559
features

592
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:28,480
or are options that is enabled on the

593
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:32,000
vpn client as well as enforced by the

594
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,039
vpn server

595
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:35,360
to be able to protect against certain

596
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:36,400
scenarios that

597
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,960
we will highlight later down the line so

598
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:40,080
these are specific sets of

599
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:41,039
configurations

600
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:44,880
to to deal with that mode specifically

601
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,840
which we applied to captive portals as

602
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:48,799
well

603
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:50,960
some just a comment on when we looked at

604
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:52,080
configuration

605
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:55,200
of captive portals in lockdown mode we

606
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,880
looked charlie said we looked at five

607
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:57,840
vendors

608
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:00,480
vpn vendors what was notable there were

609
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:01,600
two of those vendors

610
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:06,080
actually had a reasonable set of

611
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:08,159
lockdown modes up front and was clearly

612
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:10,159
documented and clearly visible

613
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:13,200
in its configuration sets

614
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:15,679
they also included what we call captive

615
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:16,320
portal

616
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:18,559
mini browsers these are proprietary

617
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:19,360
browsers that

618
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:21,600
is used for when you engage with captive

619
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:22,400
portals

620
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:25,679
so it is a buffer or a sandbox

621
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:26,559
environment in which

622
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:29,039
a browser is displayed to the user as

623
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:31,120
opposed to using your default browser on

624
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:31,919
your desktop

625
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:34,000
that might be manipulated in other ways

626
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,440
later down the line

627
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,280
other two other vendors that we looked

628
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:38,960
at didn't have this feature

629
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:40,559
and they didn't speak directly to

630
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:42,000
lockdown

631
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,480
configuration as well but they allowed

632
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:46,400
you with a very rich set of features

633
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,840
that you could configure

634
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:50,080
how you chose to based on the scenarios

635
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:51,919
you're trying to mitigate

636
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:53,679
interestingly one of the other vendors

637
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:55,600
the vpn vendors didn't have

638
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:58,960
a ipv6 out of the box mitigation

639
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:01,520
directly for ssl vpns it was only

640
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:03,440
applicable when looking at

641
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:06,159
ipsec vpns we predominantly looked at

642
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:08,960
ssl vpns because

643
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:11,520
ssl vpns tend to be the most compatible

644
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:12,880
when dealing with capital portal

645
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,400
environments

646
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:17,440
vendor five we're still busy testing

647
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:20,000
so by the time that you reached our

648
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,120
website that shall

649
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:23,360
point it out you should see an updated

650
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:25,200
version of configuration or updated

651
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,000
findings for

652
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:30,080
this vendor now going on to our research

653
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:32,799
and findings

654
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:37,039
we selected in this matrix you'll see we

655
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:38,159
selected a set

656
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:40,400
of features and that's what we refer to

657
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,720
as our lockdown features that we believe

658
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:45,360
speaks to the test cases that you would

659
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:46,159
probably

660
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:48,320
encounter in a malicious captive portal

661
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,280
environment

662
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:51,600
this is by no means a complete set of

663
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,280
features but these were pertinent in our

664
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:54,880
testing and we feel that they

665
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:57,600
cover the most scenarios that is out

666
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,919
there and is applicable

667
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:03,760
also this table is it might change by

668
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:05,760
the time that you view the website

669
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:07,520
at the time of this recording this was

670
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:09,039
the state of

671
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:11,919
our findings with one vendors findings

672
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:13,600
totally

673
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:17,760
outstanding next so let's

674
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,360
revisit the question that shell asked

675
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:21,280
earlier about why do we expect

676
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:24,400
vpns to do and how do they function in

677
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:26,640
there if you recall shaw mentioned that

678
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:28,880
we expect basically vp and resource the

679
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:29,679
vpn to

680
00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:31,760
allow us to access the corporate

681
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:32,880
resources

682
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,480
these corporate resources should

683
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:36,159
basically give us the same type of

684
00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:38,240
capabilities as if we were in that land

685
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:40,640
environment

686
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:43,679
so in evaluating that vpn in

687
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:45,600
in the in the environment that we're

688
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:46,799
looking at

689
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:51,120
we saw three categories that we

690
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:53,279
that we used in each category we had

691
00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:56,000
certain conditions that we tested for

692
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,159
in the first category being

693
00:23:57,159 --> 00:23:59,679
confidentiality we had we looked at

694
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:01,919
whether or not the vpn played any role

695
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:03,120
in mitigating

696
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:06,159
spurious broadcasts of the client

697
00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:07,679
then we also looked whether or not the

698
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:10,159
vpn played a role in mitigating

699
00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:12,480
dhcp settings specifically dna search

700
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:13,600
traffic settings

701
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:17,600
that was supplied initially

702
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:19,120
thirdly for that category we also look

703
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:20,880
if the vpn plays a new role in

704
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,000
preventing

705
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,760
the broadcast or the leakage of

706
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:25,760
sensitive information

707
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:29,120
next under at integrity

708
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:31,360
we determine whether or not the

709
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:33,039
traditional or typical

710
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:34,559
person in the middle style attack

711
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:36,240
applies here and whether the

712
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:40,400
resilience uh changes for uh

713
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,559
credential captures or residential theft

714
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:43,600
evpns are

715
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:47,120
in play lastly with access control

716
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:50,000
we looked at whether or not the man in

717
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,279
the middle

718
00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:53,039
style type of attacks as well as

719
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:55,120
malicious attackers could use

720
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:58,880
the vpn tunnel to actually

721
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:01,039
get into the corporate land while

722
00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:03,440
whatever mechanisms they chose

723
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:05,679
so let's look at the test environment

724
00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:07,279
quickly our test environment

725
00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:09,360
was very basic very simple we had a

726
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:11,600
virtual machine that was

727
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:14,559
served on a desktop with vmware and it

728
00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:16,720
had a usb

729
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:18,720
wi-fi adapter plugged into it that

730
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:19,840
allowed it to bridge

731
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:21,520
network connectivity to our captive

732
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,760
portal a captive portal was basically

733
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:25,039
just a simple

734
00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:28,320
off run-of-the-mill router paired with

735
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:30,240
the kali linux environment that played

736
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:31,120
the role of the

737
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:34,240
malicious attacker and the

738
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:37,600
virtual machine environment hosted our

739
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:40,320
endpoint servers and in a cloud

740
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:42,159
environment that we could use for our

741
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:44,159
testing and that basically simulated our

742
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:46,159
lab environment

743
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:48,400
our test approach in this matrix here is

744
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:50,080
important for basically describing

745
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:52,559
the four types of scenarios that we

746
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:53,840
tested so let me

747
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:56,880
describe the what you see here on the

748
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:57,840
left hand side

749
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:01,039
you see a column that says cap captured

750
00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:02,559
and online

751
00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:04,480
these are connection states so in other

752
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,240
words captured state is a very important

753
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:07,520
state that shall

754
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:10,320
alluded to earlier this alludes to the

755
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:12,240
fact whether or not we are

756
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:14,240
inside the capital portal state and we

757
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:16,159
don't have internet access so in other

758
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:16,640
words

759
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:18,640
you're sitting in a holding pattern

760
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:21,039
almost and you only interact with that

761
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:23,200
captive portal and maybe some resources

762
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:25,120
on that network you do not have internet

763
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:26,080
access

764
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:29,120
next online means that you actually can

765
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:30,559
get onto the internet which means you

766
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:33,440
satisfy the capital portal state

767
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:35,679
the standard mode and the lockdown mode

768
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:37,600
is the configuration of the vpn

769
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,919
that we actually applied so which means

770
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:41,440
we have

771
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:43,840
four sets of tests that we do and each

772
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:46,320
for each set of configuration and each

773
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:49,520
state connection state so for example in

774
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:50,400
the

775
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,080
captured state with standard mode

776
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:54,400
basically no internet access

777
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:56,240
uh and assuming split tunneling coming

778
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:58,159
back to us saying that we assume split

779
00:26:58,159 --> 00:27:00,480
hunting is a default state

780
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,799
using off-the-shelf configuration no

781
00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:04,799
extra configuration it was added just

782
00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:06,159
what the vendor provided

783
00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:09,120
and based on the guidance so if the vpn

784
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:10,880
vendor or the

785
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,480
configuration suggests that we should

786
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:14,960
use a different tunneling mechanism

787
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:17,600
we try to follow that in the lockdown

788
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:18,640
section

789
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:20,720
you see we tried the best vpn

790
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:21,840
configuration

791
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:24,720
for captive portal environments which

792
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,159
means that

793
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:27,760
it should speak to the test that we

794
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:29,440
throw at it and we should be able to see

795
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:30,720
how they respond to that

796
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:32,559
so that's the best way that you can

797
00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:33,760
actually protect

798
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:37,039
the user let's look now how actually how

799
00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:37,520
our

800
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:39,760
test cases stacked up and what our

801
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:40,559
results was

802
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:42,559
so this slide here is basically our

803
00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:44,880
findings the tldr

804
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,320
in a nutshell this there's a lot

805
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:48,000
happening on this slide but it's a

806
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,679
it's basically just taking what we

807
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:51,200
showed you in the previous slide

808
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:54,240
with our findings um colored in there so

809
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,320
you'll see

810
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:58,480
in the one quadrant here the first

811
00:27:58,480 --> 00:27:59,840
scenario that i suggested with the

812
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:00,640
capture

813
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,559
state with the standard mode

814
00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:05,120
configuration there's there's a grid

815
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:08,080
with six columns and six rows the

816
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:10,320
columns indicate our test cases

817
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:13,440
the rows indicate the vendor the vpn's

818
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,880
that we tested

819
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:17,919
the red color suggests a state outcome

820
00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:19,039
state or failed

821
00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:21,039
while the green color speaks to a

822
00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:22,559
successful outcome

823
00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:24,960
and the gray would indicate we haven't

824
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,240
tested that vendor

825
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:29,279
which this slide might change at the end

826
00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:32,399
by the time you visit it um but for now

827
00:28:32,399 --> 00:28:33,600
this is more or less at the time of

828
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:35,039
recording what we found

829
00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:38,000
and in this state with scenario one

830
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,520
being the one we highlighted here

831
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:42,399
basically our initial concern about vpns

832
00:28:42,399 --> 00:28:42,720
uh

833
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:45,200
during contribute almost nothing to

834
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:46,000
actually the

835
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,200
you know protecting the user

836
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:51,520
in the second state i like to deal with

837
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:53,600
online and still in standard mode

838
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:56,720
there is some improvement but not not

839
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:58,320
much so even a pairless

840
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:01,840
configuration of your vpn would resemble

841
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:02,960
something like this

842
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:04,960
even if it's not in the captured state

843
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:08,399
so not that much better

844
00:29:08,399 --> 00:29:10,799
looking at a captured state but with

845
00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:12,399
lockdown configuration

846
00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:15,360
we see there is a there's an improvement

847
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:16,159
but still

848
00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:17,679
there are some test conditions in

849
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:19,520
captured state that

850
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:21,600
cannot be mitigated even though the

851
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:22,880
configuration of this

852
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:26,240
in all those features were enabled

853
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:28,720
moving on to the final configuration

854
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:29,600
tests

855
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:32,960
test set we see that there's a drastic

856
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:33,919
improvement

857
00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:36,320
for online configuration in lockdown

858
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:38,559
mode but even with this the vendors

859
00:29:38,559 --> 00:29:40,320
features and stuff don't always work

860
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:42,480
consistently as you would expect them to

861
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:43,440
move to work

862
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:45,919
but is in this is in improvement

863
00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:47,200
nonetheless

864
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:49,200
coming back to shoal's earlier statement

865
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:51,440
about a responder style attack

866
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:53,520
the column i highlighted there speaks to

867
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:54,480
a test case

868
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:57,600
that that we used the responder in to

869
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:58,320
test with

870
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:00,880
the responder is a very well known well

871
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:01,600
understood

872
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:04,720
test scenario involving a tool that

873
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:05,600
mimics

874
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:08,880
certain types of services for example

875
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:12,240
it mimics a windows server with the

876
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:13,760
intention of soliciting

877
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:16,960
a divulging of hashes it's

878
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:20,559
in intel m v2 hashes for example

879
00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:22,080
and as you can see in the highlighted

880
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:24,240
that column first for that scenario

881
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:27,440
it failed even in that in that mode as

882
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:28,320
well it failed

883
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:30,320
and it marginally start improving as we

884
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:32,159
go to stricter configuration

885
00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:34,559
but also as we move from capture into an

886
00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:35,760
online state

887
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:38,399
so let's see how this actually looks

888
00:30:38,399 --> 00:30:39,840
when we apply this

889
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:43,679
uh in a in an environment

890
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:45,840
looking at a the demo videos are showing

891
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:46,960
you that will be available on the

892
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:48,080
website in that

893
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:50,880
in the in the url that we provide so we

894
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,799
will just look now at some screen

895
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:54,320
captures

896
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:56,640
here you'll see a vpn client that

897
00:30:56,640 --> 00:31:00,159
realizes it is behind the captive portal

898
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:02,960
it indicates that also by popping up the

899
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:04,000
captive portal mini

900
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,240
browser highlighted here and it

901
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:08,240
resembles a web browser to some degree

902
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:11,600
but this is this is purely a proprietary

903
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:15,760
interface for that specific vpn

904
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:18,960
next we highlight the fact that the dns

905
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:21,039
cache is still active the dns cache is

906
00:31:21,039 --> 00:31:22,720
not flushed and it's probably still

907
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:24,000
resolving in the background

908
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,159
which means we can speak to a dna server

909
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:29,120
most likely the captive portal

910
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:31,760
here we enact the actual test to see

911
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:33,120
whether or not

912
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:36,720
uh we can solicit uh a dns responder

913
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:37,840
attack

914
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:40,799
by doing a connection attempt to an

915
00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:42,159
unqualified

916
00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:45,200
unc path highlighted here which means

917
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:47,600
that it should try and connect and find

918
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:48,799
a connection

919
00:31:48,799 --> 00:31:52,320
in the wireshark trace what we show

920
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:53,039
there is

921
00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:54,880
actually if you notice that the

922
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,640
unqualified hostname and all of a sudden

923
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:58,720
have a fully qualified hostname

924
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:00,640
and that's important to realize that all

925
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:02,159
of a sudden a domain name

926
00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:04,480
now appears as part of that host name

927
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:06,880
where did that get that from

928
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:10,640
remember our option 15 and option 119

929
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:12,240
that we spoke about

930
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:16,559
basically the dhcp settings of the vpn

931
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:19,360
provider as well as the dhcp settings of

932
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:20,559
the

933
00:32:20,559 --> 00:32:22,720
of the capture portal provided these

934
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:23,679
options

935
00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:25,919
and it is injected in the configuration

936
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:28,080
and now our host is trying to say well

937
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:30,240
does anybody know who this host with

938
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:31,279
this suffix is

939
00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:33,120
and it try and iterate iterate until it

940
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:34,480
gets a an ip

941
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:36,559
resolve and then if it resolves it

942
00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:37,919
actually just connects to that

943
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:40,559
and this is where the dna suffix plays a

944
00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:40,960
role

945
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:44,159
in actually allowing us to solicit

946
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:47,760
unwanted or solicit traffic so

947
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:50,320
coming back to that you can see the same

948
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:51,679
same attack or same

949
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:54,159
test repeated with the wireshark trace

950
00:32:54,159 --> 00:32:55,279
in the background showing

951
00:32:55,279 --> 00:32:56,880
actually a successful connection

952
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:58,559
established to our responder

953
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:00,480
and here's the responder window with the

954
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:02,480
intel m v2 hash

955
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:06,640
captured now let's look at this

956
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:10,240
attack in a lock down mode while it's

957
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:13,519
connect while the vpn is connected

958
00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:14,880
so we're going to basically have the

959
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:16,799
same attack play out

960
00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:18,960
this states you can see the vpn realizes

961
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:20,640
it's connected to the internet

962
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:23,600
it has established its vpn vpn is

963
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:24,000
running

964
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,720
full lockdown mode should uh now be

965
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:27,919
engaged

966
00:33:27,919 --> 00:33:30,559
but when we when we run our test trying

967
00:33:30,559 --> 00:33:32,039
to do the same

968
00:33:32,039 --> 00:33:35,519
unqualified unc path connection

969
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:37,200
we see that in the background of

970
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:39,120
wireshark it actually successfully

971
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:40,559
establishes a connection

972
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:42,880
with our responder and the same scenario

973
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:44,080
played it's

974
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:48,559
played out some observations

975
00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:53,279
in dealing with these vpn configurations

976
00:33:53,279 --> 00:33:55,679
when i realized i'm dealing with quite a

977
00:33:55,679 --> 00:33:57,279
complex set of features there's

978
00:33:57,279 --> 00:33:59,919
overwhelming number of knobs and bobs

979
00:33:59,919 --> 00:34:00,960
that you have to

980
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:02,480
tweak to get some of these things to

981
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:05,039
behave in the way that you wanted to do

982
00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:06,799
especially in this type of test cases

983
00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:08,399
that we set up

984
00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:10,960
that was quite overwhelming also it

985
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:12,239
speaks to the fact that

986
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:15,839
training is matters experience matters

987
00:34:15,839 --> 00:34:17,520
as well as support from your vendors

988
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:19,599
that you engage with

989
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:21,679
that ultimately qualifies selecting your

990
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:23,918
vendors matters as well

991
00:34:23,918 --> 00:34:26,079
the another comment on captive portal

992
00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:27,280
mini browsers

993
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:29,599
they tend to be inconsistent in their

994
00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:30,719
behavior

995
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:32,879
that might give a problem or might have

996
00:34:32,879 --> 00:34:34,079
a user experience

997
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:37,280
problem for non-technical users that

998
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:39,119
might be presented in my case i've seen

999
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:40,480
the default browser pop

1000
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:42,000
up before the capital portal mini

1001
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,839
browser pop-up and that can cause

1002
00:34:43,839 --> 00:34:45,119
confusion

1003
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:48,560
another comment on mobile

1004
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:50,320
devices that we just tested to see how

1005
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:52,480
they interact with captive portals in a

1006
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:53,280
similar way

1007
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:56,000
we noticed that capital portals behavior

1008
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,320
inside op mobile operating systems

1009
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:00,640
are a lot more natural well taken care

1010
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:02,640
of it feels more baked into it

1011
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:05,760
so this is a lot to be said about the

1012
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:07,599
desktop environments that we find

1013
00:35:07,599 --> 00:35:09,839
ourselves in and how that speaks to

1014
00:35:09,839 --> 00:35:12,160
captive portals

1015
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:16,320
thank you very much joel

1016
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:19,599
awesome thanks vickers uh so it's for me

1017
00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:22,640
to try and uh wrap this up for us

1018
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:23,839
i need to take a few more minutes of

1019
00:35:23,839 --> 00:35:25,680
your time

1020
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:27,760
if we if we summarize what what we're

1021
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:28,800
saying

1022
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:31,040
said a lot but we summarize it basically

1023
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:32,000
we're arguing that

1024
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,960
we believe that there is a realistic and

1025
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:35,760
common set

1026
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:39,599
of conditions or it's a common scenario

1027
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:41,760
where users are working from either

1028
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:43,599
compromised or malicious wi-fi access

1029
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:44,480
points

1030
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:46,400
and we think that scenario needs a place

1031
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:49,280
in the corporate threat model

1032
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:51,520
captive portal is common as we've argued

1033
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:53,119
and we think it's becoming more common

1034
00:35:53,119 --> 00:35:55,680
but to be clear captive portal

1035
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:57,359
represents

1036
00:35:57,359 --> 00:36:00,000
an example of this state of this

1037
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,280
captured state it's not

1038
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:05,280
it's not a prerequisite for um

1039
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:06,320
for the set of problems that we're

1040
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:09,280
talking about um and then

1041
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:10,800
i think what's really important is we

1042
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:12,560
we're arguing that we believe

1043
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:14,640
that this expectation of network and

1044
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:17,440
security equivalency that we spoke about

1045
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:19,599
which is supposed to be provided by the

1046
00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:21,359
um vpn

1047
00:36:21,359 --> 00:36:24,880
we think that's realistic and so um

1048
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:26,880
we think that there's a realistic

1049
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:28,720
expectation that the vpn should protect

1050
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:30,160
us against the threats that we

1051
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:33,920
that we outlined um and then if we if

1052
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:35,680
i just draw your attention again to this

1053
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:39,359
um to this table that that vic has

1054
00:36:39,359 --> 00:36:42,079
shared with us the the first thing

1055
00:36:42,079 --> 00:36:43,359
you've got to take away from this is in

1056
00:36:43,359 --> 00:36:45,280
that top left quadrant where you see

1057
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:48,240
all of that red that's the vpn not

1058
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:49,280
protecting you

1059
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:50,800
against any of the threats that we

1060
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:52,880
outlined for any of the vendors that we

1061
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:55,839
tested for and of course it's perhaps

1062
00:36:55,839 --> 00:36:57,520
not reasonable that the vpn

1063
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:59,200
can protect you at that point because

1064
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:00,640
it's not connected

1065
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:03,040
but the point is there is an expectation

1066
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:04,800
of equivalency and that expectation is

1067
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,560
fundamentally not being met

1068
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:08,400
and then as vekas pointed out as we

1069
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:09,760
traverse through

1070
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:11,599
those four quadrants from top left to

1071
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:13,119
bottom left and then up the top right

1072
00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:14,800
and then down to bottom right

1073
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:16,079
what you see is that there's less and

1074
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:18,560
less red and more and more green

1075
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:20,839
so we are experiencing higher levels of

1076
00:37:20,839 --> 00:37:22,320
security

1077
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:24,800
but at no point do all the vendors

1078
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:26,400
protect us against

1079
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:28,400
all of the tests even right down to that

1080
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:30,000
bottom right hand quadrant

1081
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,160
where we're in lockdown mode and though

1082
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:33,839
it's all the appropriate features have

1083
00:37:33,839 --> 00:37:34,640
been

1084
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:36,960
put in place and the vpn is established

1085
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:38,079
even at that point

1086
00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:39,760
there are still some of these threats

1087
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:42,720
that we're not being protected against

1088
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:45,280
so the effectiveness of these offerings

1089
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:46,560
varies substantially and

1090
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:48,160
frankly quite erratically across the

1091
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:50,640
different vendors

1092
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:54,079
what do we do about that well i think

1093
00:37:54,079 --> 00:37:55,440
there's some basic technical things that

1094
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:56,800
should be quite obvious by now so i'm

1095
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:58,880
not going to spend too much time on them

1096
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:00,320
firstly you've got to understand and

1097
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:02,079
you've got to use these lock down

1098
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:04,079
features and i'm not saying that's easy

1099
00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:05,839
or that your users are going to like it

1100
00:38:05,839 --> 00:38:07,200
but understand that without those

1101
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:09,119
lockdown features enabled uh

1102
00:38:09,119 --> 00:38:10,800
things are looking pretty bleak for you

1103
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:12,560
in terms of the protections that we

1104
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:14,960
think you're probably expecting

1105
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:16,160
you've got to in doing that you've got

1106
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:17,440
to make sure that you control and

1107
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:18,000
centralize

1108
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,320
dns a lot of these attacks pivot on our

1109
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:22,240
ability to manipulate dns

1110
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:24,400
and if you can prevent that from

1111
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:25,599
happening then you're

1112
00:38:25,599 --> 00:38:28,000
looking much better in doing that you

1113
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,040
want to make sure that you're fully

1114
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:31,680
qualifying your internal dns names

1115
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:34,160
again domain search suffix poisoning is

1116
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:35,520
not essential to this

1117
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:38,480
but it's certainly a very easy way to

1118
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:39,760
enact some of these

1119
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:41,920
threats so if you can fully qualify your

1120
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:43,119
internal domain names that's going to

1121
00:38:43,119 --> 00:38:44,880
make your life better

1122
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:47,280
you want to avoid split tunneling if you

1123
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:48,640
can i know that's a

1124
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:52,240
there's a resource constraint but um

1125
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:54,480
certainly and we will publish a version

1126
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:55,920
of this chart

1127
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:58,320
where we have full tunneling enabled in

1128
00:38:58,320 --> 00:38:59,680
all cases and you'll see it looks a lot

1129
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:00,320
better

1130
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:03,599
than when you're using split tunneling

1131
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:04,960
you want to you want to be careful of

1132
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:06,320
session timeouts one of the things that

1133
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:08,000
we noticed which is quite curious

1134
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,240
is that if you allow your vpn session to

1135
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:11,119
time out

1136
00:39:11,119 --> 00:39:13,599
say every 24 hours then you end up in a

1137
00:39:13,599 --> 00:39:15,040
state where the user's got his laptop

1138
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:16,720
connected to the wi-fi goes to sleep or

1139
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:17,760
goes to the toilet

1140
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:19,839
comes back and the session is timed out

1141
00:39:19,839 --> 00:39:22,160
and and it all drops into the clear

1142
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:25,040
again so i'm not sure why vpn sessions

1143
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:26,480
time out but they shouldn't

1144
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:28,000
and then finally i think what should be

1145
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,760
apparent is that you want in addition to

1146
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:31,839
your vpn you want to have some kind of

1147
00:39:31,839 --> 00:39:35,200
edp edpr firewall something

1148
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:37,119
that's not only protecting you against

1149
00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:38,800
inbound traffic

1150
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:40,400
but it's also preventing data from

1151
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:42,160
leaving the machine particularly that

1152
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:45,280
like 445 outbound is a big problem

1153
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:47,440
at a slightly higher level tactically um

1154
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:49,040
you

1155
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:50,560
what's clear here is that we need to

1156
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:52,320
understand and remap

1157
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:53,920
the threats that we're facing to the

1158
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:55,440
technologies that we're

1159
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:58,320
using um it's a complex it's a complex

1160
00:39:58,320 --> 00:39:59,359
jigsaw and because

1161
00:39:59,359 --> 00:40:01,680
spoke about how you know how nuanced and

1162
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:03,200
how many knobs and bobs they were

1163
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:05,040
in that vpn configuration each of those

1164
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:07,440
knobs and bobs has a specific impact

1165
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:10,000
on what element of the threat model is

1166
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:10,800
being addressed so you need to

1167
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:11,839
understand that

1168
00:40:11,839 --> 00:40:13,040
you probably want to engage with your

1169
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:14,880
vendors to help you with that

1170
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:16,480
because it's there's the level of

1171
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:20,000
complexity is quite overwhelming

1172
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,200
and you probably need to think carefully

1173
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:23,280
about your vendor choices also because

1174
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:24,240
as we said the

1175
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:27,599
the behavior varied quite a lot um and

1176
00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:27,920
so

1177
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:29,200
you're probably going to want to look at

1178
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:30,800
this almost at a feature by feature

1179
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:31,440
level

1180
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:33,440
to determine which vendor is is going to

1181
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:34,800
give you the

1182
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:36,960
the right mix of features for the for

1183
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:38,000
what you understand your threat

1184
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:41,200
model to be um and then and i'll go into

1185
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:41,520
this

1186
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:43,440
in my final and next and final slide but

1187
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:45,520
um we really think that

1188
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:46,880
what this illustrates is that perhaps

1189
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:49,119
it's time to uh revisit

1190
00:40:49,119 --> 00:40:51,520
the paradigms that that we're applying

1191
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:52,319
here

1192
00:40:52,319 --> 00:40:53,599
and maybe there's fundamentally

1193
00:40:53,599 --> 00:40:54,880
different ways to think about this

1194
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:55,599
problem

1195
00:40:55,599 --> 00:40:57,200
like uh instead of trying to protect our

1196
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:59,200
vet uh our users in the

1197
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:01,359
in the on the free wi-fi uh maybe we

1198
00:41:01,359 --> 00:41:03,680
just get them to avoid free wi-fi

1199
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:05,599
completely and instead of trying to

1200
00:41:05,599 --> 00:41:06,960
force them into this tunnel and bring

1201
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:08,560
them into the corporate network maybe we

1202
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:10,319
leave them out of the corporate network

1203
00:41:10,319 --> 00:41:12,079
and just use kind of basic controls like

1204
00:41:12,079 --> 00:41:13,599
ssl certificate pinning and strong

1205
00:41:13,599 --> 00:41:15,359
authentication

1206
00:41:15,359 --> 00:41:17,280
to facilitate access to the resources

1207
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:19,359
they need if we can get rid of

1208
00:41:19,359 --> 00:41:21,680
active directory and all of those

1209
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:23,359
microsoft protocols

1210
00:41:23,359 --> 00:41:26,000
um when the when the user's not on the

1211
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:26,880
network

1212
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:29,040
you know again a lot of this stuff goes

1213
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:30,240
away

1214
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:31,839
and of course that leads towards the

1215
00:41:31,839 --> 00:41:33,280
whole discussion around zero

1216
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:35,839
trust which is a much bigger topic for

1217
00:41:35,839 --> 00:41:38,079
us to discuss today

1218
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:40,720
um i do i do want to sort of claim my

1219
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:42,079
time and claim the privilege

1220
00:41:42,079 --> 00:41:44,400
of of just kind of reflecting on this uh

1221
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:45,920
at a slightly higher level

1222
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:48,240
uh maybe a little philosophically um

1223
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:49,680
before we're done

1224
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:51,440
you know it occurs to me that the whole

1225
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:53,200
notion of free wi-fi

1226
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:54,960
emerging has become popular because

1227
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:57,280
businesses see it as a way to attract

1228
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:58,800
clients you've got to be able to give

1229
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:00,800
your clients free wi-fi

1230
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:02,000
otherwise you know they're not going to

1231
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,160
come and drink your coffee um

1232
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:07,200
and and as that grew what emerged was

1233
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:07,839
these

1234
00:42:07,839 --> 00:42:10,319
these legal and liability concerns if

1235
00:42:10,319 --> 00:42:11,680
somebody's using my wi-fi am i

1236
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:12,960
responsible for them if they do

1237
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:13,839
something bad

1238
00:42:13,839 --> 00:42:16,000
you know who the police gonna ask etc

1239
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,079
and so what the lawyers did is they

1240
00:42:18,079 --> 00:42:19,599
they insisted that there'd be some kind

1241
00:42:19,599 --> 00:42:21,359
of transaction between the wi-fi

1242
00:42:21,359 --> 00:42:22,400
provider and the

1243
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:25,040
user and how that was enforced was via

1244
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:26,560
this idea of a captive portal which is

1245
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:28,160
actually a relatively new idea

1246
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:31,680
i think the rfc dates back to 2015.

1247
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:34,560
um so the so the capture portal was put

1248
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:35,440
in place to

1249
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:37,440
to formalize the transaction between the

1250
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:39,440
user and the and the provider

1251
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:41,680
once the capture portal is there of

1252
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:43,200
course the business has other ways to

1253
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:45,359
monetize that transaction now

1254
00:42:45,359 --> 00:42:47,440
by collecting your your data exhaust

1255
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:49,280
your your behavioral data

1256
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:51,440
uh or selling you ads or you know

1257
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:53,040
whatever the case may be but

1258
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:54,960
the it's it's driven by business

1259
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:56,720
requirements of the provider

1260
00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:59,839
not by user requirements and it creates

1261
00:42:59,839 --> 00:43:01,359
this awkward state this purgatory this

1262
00:43:01,359 --> 00:43:03,760
technical purgatory that we spoke about

1263
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:05,599
and so what happens is the vpn providers

1264
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:07,119
who who are really used to dealing with

1265
00:43:07,119 --> 00:43:08,720
the previous version the internet

1266
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:10,960
now have to pivot to deal with this new

1267
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:12,400
reality where you sit in

1268
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:15,200
you know wi-fi purgatory and and they do

1269
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:16,880
that by implementing all of these

1270
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:19,440
highly complex nuanced you know

1271
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:22,319
technical features

1272
00:43:22,319 --> 00:43:25,440
which our research shows really

1273
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:27,680
don't work because fundamentally the

1274
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:29,200
odds are stacked against them in that

1275
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:30,560
state where the

1276
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:33,440
machine is captured on the wi-fi network

1277
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:34,880
but can't talk to the internet

1278
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:37,200
uh the vpn technology really just can't

1279
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:38,720
do anything

1280
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:40,240
and so we stand here today saying to you

1281
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:41,520
well actually what you need is more

1282
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:42,800
technology you need to add

1283
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:46,160
uh edp or edr or firewalls or whatever

1284
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:48,560
to protect you in in that scenario um

1285
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:50,319
and so this sort of cycle continues but

1286
00:43:50,319 --> 00:43:51,680
really what's happening is we have a

1287
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:53,440
struggle between two business models

1288
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:54,720
there's the business that wants to

1289
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:56,640
provide you free wi-fi

1290
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:59,599
because respectfully it serves them and

1291
00:43:59,599 --> 00:44:00,800
then you have the businesses that want

1292
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:02,240
to sell you protections

1293
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:04,640
uh because that's what they what they do

1294
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:05,839
and you're kind of struck

1295
00:44:05,839 --> 00:44:08,480
between the two and it requires us that

1296
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:10,800
if all you did was take the free wi-fi

1297
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:13,119
out and then all of these other things

1298
00:44:13,119 --> 00:44:14,000
would also just

1299
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:17,040
uh disappear um and so

1300
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:18,400
i think this kind of speaks to the point

1301
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:20,079
of maybe readjusting our paradigms a

1302
00:44:20,079 --> 00:44:21,119
little bit

1303
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:22,800
and asking ourselves the question you

1304
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:24,560
know is is free wi-fi

1305
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:27,839
really free i guess uh and then finally

1306
00:44:27,839 --> 00:44:29,040
on a closing note i just want to take

1307
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:31,040
one minute to say thank you very much to

1308
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:32,960
the vendors that supported us all of the

1309
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:34,160
vpn vendors

1310
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:36,079
uh have been engaging with us they've

1311
00:44:36,079 --> 00:44:38,480
been assisting us in in numerous ways

1312
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:39,760
but i also want to give a particular

1313
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:42,240
shout out to the team at finite state

1314
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:45,040
uh they're an iot vulnerability

1315
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:46,480
assessment company

1316
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:50,000
that assisted us in analyzing almost 800

1317
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:53,119
vpn firmwares

1318
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:54,640
to try and understand some of the things

1319
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:56,400
that that we're looking for they

1320
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:57,920
have a remarkable data set and

1321
00:44:57,920 --> 00:44:59,680
remarkable technology and we just wanted

1322
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:00,720
to say thanks to them

1323
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:02,560
and encourage you to have a look at what

1324
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:04,720
they're doing

1325
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:06,880
and with that we're out of time all

1326
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:07,760
that's left us

1327
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:09,359
for us is to say buy a donkey which is

1328
00:45:09,359 --> 00:45:11,040
afrikaans for

1329
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:13,520
thank you and we look forward to hearing

1330
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:15,759
your

1331
00:45:16,839 --> 00:45:18,160
questions

1332
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:20,160
hi everyone uh thanks for joining us

1333
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:22,319
tonight uh we have just one

1334
00:45:22,319 --> 00:45:24,560
uh minute i think for questions so if

1335
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:26,400
there's anyone with a question or

1336
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:27,760
comment then uh

1337
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:33,839
then shoot and i'll make vicus answer

1338
00:45:35,359 --> 00:45:38,960
no comments

1339
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:42,800
all right well um let me just leave it

1340
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:44,079
to say uh

1341
00:45:44,079 --> 00:45:46,480
as we said numerous times the updated

1342
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:48,480
findings are on the website

1343
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:50,480
uh we're continuing to test with the

1344
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:52,640
fifth vendor and we hope to add more

1345
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:56,160
so visit us there from time to time

1346
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:58,960
also i've updated the white paper with a

1347
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:00,079
copy of that summary

1348
00:46:00,079 --> 00:46:02,000
table so if you download the white paper

1349
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:03,280
you should expect to see that summary

1350
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:04,560
table

1351
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:08,160
right front and center sort of

1352
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:15,280
near the top of the paper

1353
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:17,920
daniel's uh question there or statement

1354
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:20,400
it is important uh

1355
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:22,880
to to combine uh different solutions

1356
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:25,040
because i mean to be fair vpns

1357
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:27,280
are aren't a single solution for

1358
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:28,640
everything and they

1359
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:30,480
address a specific need which is grown

1360
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:32,000
out of a

1361
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,480
a long history of uh requirements built

1362
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:36,480
up over time so i think

1363
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:40,079
vpns alone can't do the job and it's

1364
00:46:40,079 --> 00:46:43,200
a it's a good indication as well that we

1365
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:44,800
need to combine our efforts and

1366
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:45,440
understand

1367
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:48,800
our threat landscape that we

1368
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:57,839
know how to address these things

1369
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,400
any more
