00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:16,800
hi everyone

3
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,880
i'm nate p trustmoreland and today i'm

4
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:20,800
presenting hacking the voter

5
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:22,560
lessons from a decade of russian

6
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,800
military operations

7
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:27,680
over the next 35 minutes i'll cover what

8
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:29,359
prompted today's talk

9
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:31,359
the importance of the information space

10
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:33,600
in russian strategic thought

11
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,520
how this thinking plays out in russian

12
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,280
military election interference

13
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:38,320
operations

14
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:40,480
and what we should be doing based on

15
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:42,559
these insights

16
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:44,640
as a brief introduction i want to point

17
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,399
out a few parts of my bio that i think

18
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:48,079
are relevant to today

19
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:49,840
i have a little hands-on experience with

20
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:51,920
elections having done field organizing

21
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:55,360
on the 2008 obama for america campaign

22
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:57,600
after that youthful diversion i did

23
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,199
graduate research at yale

24
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:02,079
on chinese cyber strategy and have since

25
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:02,960
worked at

26
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:06,320
booz allen on cti for more than a decade

27
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:08,400
running several ocean teams and

28
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,920
presently serving as the head of

29
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:12,799
strategic cyber threat intelligence

30
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:15,600
as you can see my academic background in

31
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:16,159
history

32
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:18,400
in international relations is not

33
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,080
technology

34
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,320
this is translated to a research focus

35
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,080
on looking for not just the

36
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:26,720
how of cyber operations but the bigger

37
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:27,439
picture

38
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:31,200
why like why conduct a particular

39
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,320
operation

40
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,400
in the first place when an adversary

41
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,600
could be doing anything

42
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:39,520
else why take action at any given time

43
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:42,720
like why release stolen documents open

44
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,200
breakers or release wipers on one day as

45
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,119
opposed to any other day

46
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:50,560
once you have the ability to do so

47
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:53,600
why use these tactics

48
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,920
how does this help achieve whatever goal

49
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,000
the adversary has

50
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,399
what was the objective like what was the

51
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:01,600
point of it all

52
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,680
and how does this operation relate to

53
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,759
other ones not just in terms of tactics

54
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:08,239
but also the motivation

55
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:10,239
today's presentation was inspired by a

56
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:12,160
report my company published in march

57
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:14,800
that tried to answer those questions

58
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,640
we synthesized more than 15 years of

59
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:19,120
publicly documented activity attributed

60
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:21,760
to russia's military espionage and

61
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:22,800
special forces

62
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,480
agency the gru we wanted to figure out

63
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:27,840
what the gru was

64
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,560
thinking to do this we essentially took

65
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:31,920
them at their word

66
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:34,959
you see public russian policy documents

67
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:37,200
detail the military's high-level logic

68
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,480
and world view

69
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,239
they describe what prompts the military

70
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:42,480
to take action and how the military sees

71
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:43,360
its tactics

72
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:46,720
advancing its mission the gru's mission

73
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,480
is to identify and then

74
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,879
neutralize or counter threats to russian

75
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:52,959
national security interests

76
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:55,519
very long story short the gru has been

77
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:57,440
doing essentially what the military says

78
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,200
it's going to do

79
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,959
today's presentation draws on the

80
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:02,959
report's findings to narrowly look at

81
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:05,040
one gru focus

82
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:08,080
elections now

83
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,080
russian covert election influence

84
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,879
activities didn't start in the cyber era

85
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:15,280
the soviet union's intelligence agency

86
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,720
is engaged in covert election

87
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:19,519
interference as far back as the 1920s

88
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:21,840
and sarah the case of washington senator

89
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:22,959
henry scoop

90
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:26,000
jackson in 1976 he ran

91
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,840
for the democratic party's nomination

92
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,040
for president

93
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:31,120
he was a russia hardliner and so

94
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:33,760
according to archival kgb documents

95
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,840
the soviet union aimed to derail his

96
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,680
candidacy

97
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:40,480
at the time the kgb frustratingly noted

98
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,400
that he had never been involved in any

99
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,879
major political or personal scandal

100
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:47,200
so they went digging for dirt they

101
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,599
looked everywhere even digging down

102
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:51,680
records in norway where his family had

103
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,840
migrated from almost 100 years

104
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:56,640
earlier eventually they settled on

105
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:57,920
discrediting him

106
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:00,879
by portraying him as being secretly gay

107
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:03,120
he had married late in life and earlier

108
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,280
in his career rumors had circulated in

109
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,040
dc that he was a

110
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,760
confirmed bachelor having lived with

111
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:12,239
male roommates at times

112
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:15,120
so the kgb forged several documents to

113
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,238
confirm this narrative

114
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:18,478
including a memo from fbi director j

115
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:19,839
edgar hoover

116
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,680
the kgb then sent the files to

117
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,639
newspapers and his political opponents

118
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:26,720
as far as i can tell the files were

119
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:29,040
never published but jackson's campaign

120
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:29,840
failed to gain

121
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:33,440
traction regardless in short

122
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,759
russian foreign election interference

123
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:36,800
isn't new

124
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,320
nor are many of their fundamental

125
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,080
strategies what

126
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,880
has changed is who's doing it and what

127
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,320
tools they use

128
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:47,440
in september 1985 then cia deputy

129
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,440
director for intelligence robert gates

130
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:50,320
told congress

131
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:52,560
that the primary soviet organizations

132
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,680
responsible for

133
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,680
foreign political influence activities

134
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,440
were the kgb

135
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,759
and the soviet communist party's

136
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:01,680
political organizing and propaganda

137
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,360
departments

138
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:06,400
so then the question arises how did

139
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,560
covert election interference become a

140
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,320
military mission

141
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,160
to answer those questions a good place

142
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:15,120
to start is the late 1990s

143
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,600
around this time russian foreign policy

144
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,360
elites began to coalesce around a

145
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,680
concept called

146
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:23,680
informatsone protifoborstvo

147
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:26,000
commonly translated as information

148
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,080
confrontation

149
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,160
this argues that international relations

150
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,000
are fundamentally a struggle between

151
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,759
states over what is known

152
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:36,800
perceived believed and felt for those of

153
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,000
you kremlinologists

154
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,759
concerned with the russian psyche the

155
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:42,000
choice of word protivo borztebo is

156
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,320
interesting it connotes a sense of

157
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,120
fighting in

158
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,440
opposition rather than a clash of two

159
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:48,240
systems

160
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,120
suggesting a world view of russia

161
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,600
responding to an

162
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,639
informational assault hence a more

163
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:56,560
literal translation is closer to an

164
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:00,000
informational counteraction the struggle

165
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,120
is continuous

166
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,880
existing beyond traditional concepts of

167
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:05,280
delineated war and peace

168
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,639
for this reason the sometimes

169
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:08,720
translation of the term as information

170
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,039
warfare can mislead about the concept as

171
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:12,880
it erroneously suggests that russo

172
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:13,759
perceived

173
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:16,160
itself as being in a uniquely heightened

174
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,919
state of conflict

175
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:20,319
a wartime battlefield clash of armies so

176
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:22,560
to speak represents just a fraction of

177
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:25,199
modern military engagement

178
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:26,960
former chief of the military's general

179
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:29,680
staff yuri bolyevsky noted in a 2017

180
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:33,039
interview that quote the victory over

181
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:34,000
the enemy in this

182
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,479
conflict can be much more important than

183
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:39,360
victory in a classical military conflict

184
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:42,479
because it is bloodless yet the impact

185
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:44,639
is overwhelming and can paralyze

186
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:46,840
all of the enemy state's power

187
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,080
structures

188
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,400
in short then international relations

189
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,400
for russia is a conflict over the

190
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,199
political or

191
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:56,400
national capacity to oppose ignore

192
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:59,520
or support its agenda contrast the

193
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:00,960
sweeping concept

194
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,960
of a nation struggling for an advantage

195
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,560
in the information space

196
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,720
with the much narrower and more siloed

197
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,800
western concept of agencies and

198
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:09,680
organizations

199
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:12,960
securing cyberspace

200
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:15,280
the russian military buys into

201
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:17,440
information confrontation

202
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,680
here's something they wrote in 2000 in

203
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:20,479
the national

204
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:24,080
information security doctrine quote

205
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,520
information conflict is the

206
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:28,000
confrontation between two or more states

207
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,599
in the information space

208
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:32,319
with the purpose of inflicting damage to

209
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:33,840
information systems

210
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:36,479
processes and resources critical and

211
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:37,759
other structures

212
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:40,160
undermining the political economic and

213
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,840
social systems

214
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:44,879
a massive psychological manipulation of

215
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:46,240
the population

216
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:49,360
to destabilize the state in society as

217
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,639
well as coercing

218
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:52,319
the state to take decisions for the

219
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:54,879
benefit of the opposing force

220
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:56,639
similar language has continued to

221
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:59,039
permeate military documents from

222
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:01,360
you know through the present day

223
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,199
furthermore it's helpfully defined by

224
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:04,960
the russian military's

225
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:07,759
website this is why according to its

226
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:08,479
doctrine

227
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:10,400
the russian military's responsibilities

228
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,319
now include protecting

229
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:14,479
russian historical spiritual and

230
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:15,840
patriotic traditions

231
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:18,479
and guarding against russian cultural

232
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:20,080
strife

233
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,759
that's hardly the stuff of traditional

234
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:24,240
western concepts of military security

235
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,240
generally defined as defending against

236
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,000
armed foreign aggression

237
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,680
and the ability to enforce policy

238
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,840
through the use of force

239
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:34,320
now russian strategists note that the

240
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,320
information conflict is waged with two

241
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,240
classes of capabilities

242
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,880
first informational psychological which

243
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,880
controls the information itself

244
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,880
informational technical which controls

245
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:47,120
the systems by which information is held

246
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:49,920
transmitted or processed it's probably

247
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,680
not a coincidence then that the two

248
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:52,399
primary

249
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:54,720
activity groups within the gru best

250
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,160
known to the public as apt

251
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:59,440
28 and sandworm closely aligned with the

252
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:02,240
psychological and technical capabilities

253
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,399
generally speaking then apt-28

254
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:05,440
operations

255
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,440
control the information environment with

256
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:10,320
espionage data leaks and disinformation

257
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,720
sandworm however controls the

258
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,880
information environment with destruction

259
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:18,000
and disruption

260
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,240
the goal of the information conflict is

261
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,279
shaping national

262
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:23,839
psyches and perceptions over the long

263
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:24,800
run

264
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:27,440
for this reason achieving quantifiable

265
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,399
measurable

266
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:30,560
traditional victories probably are not

267
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,080
the whole game

268
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,720
what about swinging outcomes this is

269
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,320
probably an ideal result

270
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,000
where some certain candidates are

271
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,560
elected and referendums are not passed

272
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:43,519
however in an information conflict it

273
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:46,240
needn't be the only winning scenario

274
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,480
furthermore numerous studies have shown

275
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,920
that moscow's likely preferred

276
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:52,000
candidates have rarely won despite

277
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,480
russian interference

278
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,480
other valuable impacts of information

279
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,240
operations include

280
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:01,360
one the clash of power

281
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:04,480
information operations undermined social

282
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,800
cohesion and tarnished the reputation of

283
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:09,279
opponents leaders and institutions

284
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:11,839
thereby russia weakens the ability of

285
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:13,600
its opponents to lead their own

286
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:14,320
countries

287
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,160
as well as to build and lead

288
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:17,600
international institutions and

289
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,480
coalitions

290
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:21,600
like the eu and nato

291
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,600
thus by shaping the information

292
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,519
landscape russia diminishes the ability

293
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:28,160
of its opponents to oppose it

294
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,839
second these operations are

295
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:32,000
opportunistic

296
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,160
they serve to periodically shake the

297
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:36,480
dynamics of international relations to

298
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:36,880
create

299
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:40,079
new opportunities for russian influence

300
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:41,839
many political scientists describe

301
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:43,760
international relations as being like a

302
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,600
high-powered card game

303
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,839
you can peek at your opponent's cards

304
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:50,480
signal like i have a great card

305
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,640
signal cards or change the game in your

306
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:55,760
favor perhaps by shuffling the deck

307
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:59,440
i see or i think that we're seeing

308
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:02,800
russia playing with a weak hand of hard

309
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,720
and soft power capabilities

310
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,399
so it may be attempting to disrupt the

311
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:07,920
fundamental dynamics where the

312
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,920
proverbial deck can feel stacked against

313
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,440
it

314
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:14,240
thirdly information operations may have

315
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,120
a domestic

316
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:17,600
angle remember that an information

317
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,800
conflict is both

318
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:22,000
offensive and defensive election

319
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,839
interference likely in part serves to

320
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:25,360
maintain the current leadership in

321
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,079
russia

322
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:28,160
the resulting narratives perhaps serve

323
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,240
to signal to russians that fair

324
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,320
free and truly competitive democratic

325
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,240
systems are not desirable

326
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:37,600
or perhaps not even possible

327
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,279
with these ideas of information

328
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:40,959
confrontation in mind

329
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:42,720
let's see how that perspective has

330
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,959
shaped several gru election interference

331
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:47,279
operations

332
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:49,920
in february 2014 after several months of

333
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:50,720
protests

334
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,639
a popular uprising known as the euro

335
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:55,279
maidan overthrew ukraine's pro-russia

336
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:57,040
president viktor yanukovych

337
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:59,920
sending him fleeing to russia mass

338
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,920
demonstrations denounce his resistance

339
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:04,320
to closer eu ties and is fostering of

340
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,800
widespread oligarchic corruption

341
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,720
the revolution then installed a new

342
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:11,120
government that was eager to politically

343
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:13,279
militarily and economically distance

344
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:14,800
itself from russia

345
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,880
immediately signaling its intention to

346
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,000
join the eu

347
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,760
and it was soon after muse about

348
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:22,639
pursuing a nato membership

349
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:26,000
this was a huge problem for russia

350
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,600
russia declared that the new government

351
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,120
was illegitimate

352
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,880
furthermore moscow claimed that the new

353
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,720
ukrainian government was comprised of

354
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:33,519
extreme

355
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:37,120
ukrainian nationalists quote fascists

356
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:40,800
nazis neo-nazis and anti-semites end

357
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:41,519
quote

358
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:43,600
who would persecute ethnic russians and

359
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:46,240
other ethnic minorities

360
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:48,560
russia promptly responded by using gru's

361
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,880
special forces wearing unmarked uniforms

362
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:53,360
to destabilize eastern ukraine and annex

363
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,200
the crimean peninsula

364
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,760
well given that yanukovych had left the

365
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,360
country it was necessary to hold a

366
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,959
presidential election which was

367
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:02,000
scheduled for

368
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,760
may 25th according to ukraine's cert

369
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:08,000
in mid-march just as russian forces were

370
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:08,959
rolling in

371
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:10,959
the gru began laying the technical

372
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:12,160
groundwork to interfere with the

373
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:14,079
election

374
00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:16,560
the plan went into action just days

375
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,079
before the election

376
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:20,240
details what exactly unfolded have

377
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,399
become a little confused and available

378
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:23,440
public sources

379
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:26,399
but as best as i can determine here's

380
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:27,920
what happened

381
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:31,200
on may 22nd the gru used a wiper with

382
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:34,079
hard-coded administrative passwords to

383
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:36,399
disrupt systems at ukraine's central

384
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:37,440
election commission

385
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:40,720
the cec according to ukraine's national

386
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:43,519
security service the sbu

387
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:45,680
the attackers appeared to focus on the

388
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:46,639
elections

389
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:49,279
analytics system used to aggregate voter

390
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:50,399
data

391
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:53,680
about 20 hours later the cec was up and

392
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:55,199
running again having restored from

393
00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:56,959
backups

394
00:13:56,959 --> 00:13:59,839
on the morning of may 23rd the gru in

395
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:02,800
the guise of hacktivist cyberbear coupe

396
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,480
published a statement claiming to have

397
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:07,920
destroyed the cec's vote counting system

398
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,519
as proof they provided plenty of

399
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:11,760
internal data such as admin passwords

400
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,519
and network diagrams

401
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:15,360
the ukrainian government about an hour

402
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,920
or so later issued two statements

403
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:21,199
the cec attested that there had been

404
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:24,240
some technical problems quote unquote in

405
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,240
the elections and voting systems

406
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,760
and functionality had been fully

407
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:30,880
restored the sbu noted that they had

408
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,480
discovered and stopped what sounds like

409
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:33,519
a logic bomb

410
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:35,440
that would have gone off on election day

411
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:38,320
and destroyed the elections results

412
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,800
the sbu blamed conspirators working with

413
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:44,800
the yanukovych government for the attack

414
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,600
the next day march 24th the personal

415
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:50,160
website of interior minister arson

416
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:52,560
alvakov was modified with a statement

417
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,160
about the attack

418
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,560
the blog post indicated that cec vote

419
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:58,639
counting systems had been destroyed and

420
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:01,040
could not be recovered by the election

421
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:02,000
nevertheless

422
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,279
the election could process and proceed

423
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:05,839
with an

424
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:09,279
entirely manual vote count the

425
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:11,360
statement blamed the situation on the

426
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:12,880
criminal negligence

427
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:15,839
of certain cec officials and bemoaned

428
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:17,760
the security agencies had been slow to

429
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:20,160
release appropriate details

430
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:22,639
russian government media like rt and

431
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:23,839
arya navosti

432
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:26,240
picked up on this apparent confirmation

433
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:28,320
amplifying it

434
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:31,040
later that day avocados official

435
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,240
facebook account

436
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:34,399
stated that his website had been defaced

437
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:36,160
and disavowed the content

438
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:39,680
quote they posted fake statements by me

439
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:40,000
about

440
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,120
the election it's fake aimed at creating

441
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:45,199
information chaos and disrupting the

442
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:48,000
normal election process

443
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
he further noted that cec was

444
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,839
functioning and the election would occur

445
00:15:52,839 --> 00:15:56,000
normally then came election day

446
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,560
march 25th that morning cyber recruit

447
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,639
leaked emails allegedly showing an

448
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:02,480
attempt by government officials to boost

449
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:03,120
correct

450
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:06,240
candidates in the election the documents

451
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:07,839
allegedly contained instructions to

452
00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:09,360
ensure the victory of an extremist

453
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,279
ukrainian nationalist political group

454
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:13,360
affiliated with pravi sector

455
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:15,199
a fringe political party and

456
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:18,160
paramilitary group

457
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:20,720
election day thus proceeded throughout

458
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:21,279
the day

459
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:24,160
the cec's website showed various 404 not

460
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:25,120
found errors

461
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:29,199
then 12 and between 12 and 40 minutes

462
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:30,560
before polls closed

463
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:33,759
at 8 pm that evening the cec website was

464
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:35,360
defaced to show that

465
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:37,759
exactly as russia and the cyber burkhood

466
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:39,360
fake divis had warned

467
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,360
a fringe nationalist candidate

468
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:43,199
representing the province sector party

469
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:43,920
had

470
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:46,560
inconceivably won the election with 37

471
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,079
percent of the vote

472
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:50,079
this was impressive because he had been

473
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:51,839
pulling in just the single digits

474
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:55,600
days earlier the vote rigging cyber

475
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,519
burkuk claimed would happen appeared to

476
00:16:57,519 --> 00:16:59,120
have come to pass

477
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,680
immediately russian state broadcast or

478
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:02,560
channel 1

479
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,400
relayed the results in a live news

480
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,160
bulletin further adding a sheen of

481
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,520
authenticity

482
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:09,760
but this wasn't the end as the manual

483
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,760
vote trickled in that night

484
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:15,359
the gr use launched a ddos against

485
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:18,400
the vote towing system from three one to

486
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,839
three am local time

487
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:21,439
hindering the transfer of vote tallies

488
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:23,839
from ukraine's districts to the cec

489
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:25,679
thereby further delaying the publication

490
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:27,359
of the real vote

491
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:29,520
side note in fact the province sector

492
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:31,280
candidate had actually come in

493
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:33,760
11th place with less than 1 percent of

494
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:35,120
the vote

495
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:37,360
in sum russia had dominated the

496
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:38,960
information landscape through a

497
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:41,200
carefully planned operation

498
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,960
and identified narratives that

499
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,640
threatened the perceived fairness of the

500
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:45,280
election

501
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:47,679
and legitimacy of the government as well

502
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:49,600
as issues that divided the ukrainian

503
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:50,720
people

504
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:53,120
it then took steps to cede evidence

505
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:54,720
through technical and psychological

506
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,480
means to support these narratives

507
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:58,160
and hinder its opponent's ability to

508
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,600
respond

509
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:03,200
to quote the immortal 1984 fantasy film

510
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,480
the dungeon master

511
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:07,520
the gru had declared i reject your

512
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,280
reality and insert my

513
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:13,760
own in 2015 bulgaria held a two-round

514
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:16,080
country-wide local election

515
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,760
at the time the country's ruling party

516
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:19,600
had taken a policy tact

517
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,840
of distancing bulgaria from russia on a

518
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:22,640
promise of

519
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,559
benefits of closer alignment with the

520
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:25,679
west

521
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:27,039
earlier that year the government had

522
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:29,360
denied the russian military access to

523
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:30,640
bulgarian airspace

524
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,480
citing its objection to russia's bombing

525
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:34,559
campaigns in syria

526
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:37,120
in this context the election was seen as

527
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:39,280
a referendum on the country's

528
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:42,799
ruling coalition distancing from russia

529
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:44,480
the bulgarian government alleges that

530
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:46,400
the gru attempted to interfere with this

531
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:47,840
election

532
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:50,080
on october 25th the first round of

533
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:52,559
voting massive ddos attacks hit

534
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:53,840
government websites

535
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:56,160
the ddos hit the interior ministry

536
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,120
foreign ministry

537
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:59,039
the central election commission and the

538
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:00,559
government organization that tells

539
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:02,240
voters their polling station

540
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:05,039
and their voter registration status

541
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:06,720
according to the election commission

542
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,000
the traffic on their website was

543
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,080
equivalent to 65

544
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:13,039
million active sessions at once that's

545
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:14,799
mighty impressive for a country with a

546
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:19,280
population of only 7 million people

547
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:22,640
the ddos reportedly changed multiple

548
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,400
times in apparent response to the site

549
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,240
administrators varying their defenses

550
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:27,440
leading government officials to

551
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:29,679
hypothesize that maybe insiders were

552
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:31,280
providing information on counter

553
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:32,799
measures

554
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:34,640
a week later during the second voting

555
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:37,440
round another smaller ddos targeted the

556
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:38,080
cec

557
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:41,039
and the bulgarian president's website in

558
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:41,679
some

559
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:43,440
these operations appear designed to

560
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:44,880
block access to

561
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,880
key authoritative sources of information

562
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:48,320
about the election

563
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,480
as no counter narrative appeared to our

564
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,720
knowledge it's possible that the attack

565
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:55,360
may have variously served to frustrate

566
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,679
bulgarian voters raise concerns about

567
00:19:57,679 --> 00:19:59,120
legitimacy of their vote

568
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:01,919
and impose costs on their leadership by

569
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:02,559
the way

570
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:03,919
the voters rallied around the

571
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:05,760
pro-western government expanding its

572
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:06,400
repute

573
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,480
its representation in local governments

574
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:11,520
throughout bulgaria

575
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:14,080
in november 2016 france's centrist

576
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:16,240
finance minister emmanuel macron

577
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:18,799
joined a crowded field of candidates for

578
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:20,000
the may 2017

579
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,880
presidential election at the time the

580
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,640
leading candidate appeared to be marine

581
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:25,440
le pen

582
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:28,480
an overtly pro-russia anti-eu candidate

583
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:30,880
macron a dark horse candidate rapidly

584
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,720
gained in the polls and became a leading

585
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:34,400
candidate by the end of the year just

586
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,080
behind le pen

587
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:38,559
macron had not positioned himself as

588
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:40,799
being particularly anti-russia

589
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:43,120
he but he did however threaten russian

590
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:45,360
strategic interests by being a fervent

591
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:46,880
supporter of the eu

592
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:50,240
and internationalism in december as

593
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:52,320
macron rose in the polls the gru began

594
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:54,080
fishing macron's campaign and in

595
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:54,880
february

596
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,720
the campaign publicly accused russia of

597
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:59,280
attempting to breach its systems

598
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:02,080
concurrently pro-kremlin media blasted

599
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:03,760
macron with constantly changing

600
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:05,200
allegations

601
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:07,600
including among other things that he was

602
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:08,720
secretly gay

603
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:11,360
an american spy being supported by a

604
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:13,760
global cabal of jewish bankers

605
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:16,559
you name it it probably didn't matter if

606
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:18,880
the public accepted any given falsehood

607
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:20,480
but rather that they felt there was

608
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,880
something unsavory about macron

609
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:26,000
given all these stories they'd heard

610
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,039
on may 3rd an anonymous user posted

611
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:31,039
documents on 4chan reporting to show

612
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:32,480
that macron had an

613
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:34,320
undisclosed offshore account in the

614
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:36,240
bahamas le pen

615
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:37,919
referenced the documents in that

616
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:40,559
evening's debate security researchers

617
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:42,320
later assessed that the documents may

618
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:43,600
have been forged or digitally

619
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:47,039
manipulated versions of real documents

620
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:49,679
on may 5th the leaker published a higher

621
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:51,679
resolution version of the document as

622
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:52,320
well as

623
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,640
9 gigabytes of macron campaign

624
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:56,000
communications

625
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,400
this news was amplified on social media

626
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,600
by leak sites

627
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,440
fringe political commentators and

628
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:04,880
accounts displaying bot-like behavior

629
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:06,960
note that france has a legal moratorium

630
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,080
on campaigning

631
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:09,760
and campaign press coverage during the

632
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:12,000
final 48 hours prior to national

633
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,880
elections the leaks went viral before

634
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:16,080
that deadline

635
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:17,840
although the macron campaign was able to

636
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:19,360
issue a brief statement before the

637
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:21,120
deadline french media were largely

638
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:24,480
unable to comment on the leak

639
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:26,880
the campaign also had an informational

640
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,400
technical opponent about which

641
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:32,080
much less is publicly known the nsa has

642
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:34,000
publicly confirmed in general terms that

643
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,919
russian hackers had penetrated some

644
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:36,720
french

645
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:40,559
infrastructure related to the election

646
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:43,120
montenegro has a complex relationship

647
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:44,159
with russia

648
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:45,760
russia promotes the country's shared

649
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,919
orthodox heritage invests heavily in

650
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:49,760
many sectors and sends tourists to

651
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:51,600
account for a quarter montenegro's

652
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:52,480
visitors

653
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:54,960
despite these overtures montenegro has

654
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:57,520
followed a clearly pro-west trajectory

655
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:58,960
the country is headed towards eu

656
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:01,120
membership and most relevant to this

657
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:01,679
example

658

659
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:06,559
montenegro

660
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:08,480
held parliamentary elections that would

661
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:09,919
determine whether the pro-west

662
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:11,840
government would remain in power

663
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:14,480
and complete its nato membership process

664
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:16,320
preventing the expansion of nato is a

665
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:17,120
core

666
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:19,600
russian national security concern

667
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,440
according to montenegro and the united

668
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:22,000
kingdom

669
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,320
russia attempted to disrupt this pivotal

670
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:25,919
election

671
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:28,000
in a manner similar to what happened in

672
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,080
bulgaria on the three days leading up to

673
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:30,720
the election

674
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:33,120
russian operators allegedly directed

675
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,480
ddos attacks

676
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:37,360
disrupted media websites the companies

677
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:39,520

non-governmental organization or ngo

680
00:23:45,279 --> 00:23:47,200
that was promoting the election

681
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:51,279
and the ruling pro-nato party

682
00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:53,279
additional unattributed ddos attacks

683
00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:54,960
targeted the montenegrin government's

684
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:56,720
web portal for two days following the

685
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:58,080
election

686
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:00,159
in addition to this russia attempted to

687
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:02,000
manipulate montenegro's political and

688
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,679
social environment by allegedly

689
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:04,640
funneling money

690
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,880
into opposition political groups and

691
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,960
seeking to coordinate with politicians

692
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:12,159
clergy ngos and media outlets

693
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:14,640
most disturbingly the gru allegedly

694
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:16,640
planned to use political violence

695
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,480
montenegro claims that the gru had

696
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,640
recruited serbian nationals to dress in

697
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,960
police uniforms and occupy parliament on

698
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:25,440
the night of the election

699
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:27,200
a russia-friendly political party would

700
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:29,039
then use messaging services like

701
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:29,919
whatsapp

702
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:31,840
to call upon its members to storm the

703
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:34,240
building the fake police would then fire

704
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:36,000
upon the protesters sparking an

705
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,679
anti-government groundswell

706
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:39,120
and thus prevent the real election

707
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:41,440
winners from taking power

708
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:44,159
the coup thankfully didn't occur

709
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:46,000
montenegrin law enforcement acting on

710
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,520
tips from several nato countries

711
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:49,679
arrested two gru officers and their

712
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:52,080
agents shortly before the election

713
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:54,000
furthermore the montenegrin government

714
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,279
preemptively blocked

715
00:24:55,279 --> 00:24:57,919
national access to whatsapp and viber on

716
00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:00,320
election day

717
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:04,080
now of course we can't talk about gru

718
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:05,760
election interference without discussing

719
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:08,720
the 2016 us presidential election

720
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:10,799
rather than rehash all of the tactics

721
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:11,760
let's put a few

722
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,120
in the light of information

723
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:15,360
confrontation and the other examples we

724
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:18,000
just discussed

725
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,880
the gru used many tactics we just

726
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:22,400
examined to control and manipulate the

727
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:24,640
information environment around the us's

728
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:25,919
election

729
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:28,880
the gru stole emails working documents

730
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,400
and other sensitive data

731
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,000
and laundered it into the american

732
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,919
public discourse

733
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:35,440
the group published directly through

734
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:37,360
personas like cyberbrick

735
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:40,559
dc leaks and guccifer or guccifer

736
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:44,320
2.0 and like-minded leak sites the gru

737
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:45,919
also reached out to journalists

738
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:47,679
politically connected individuals and

739
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:49,279
other shapers of american public

740
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:50,080
discourse

741
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:52,799
who published commented on and amplified

742
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:54,320
these leaks and the narratives

743
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:56,640
associated with them

744
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:58,880
the gru attempted to convince americans

745
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:00,240
that their elections were

746
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:02,799
rigged leaking emails from democratic

747
00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:05,039
party leaders and members of the media

748
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:07,200
which the gru claimed was evidence of

749
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,080
coordinated

750
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:10,720
coordinated favoritism for candidate

751
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:11,600
clinton

752
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:13,679
this sure sounds a lot like those emails

753
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:15,600
the gru leaked on the morning of the

754
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:19,120
2014 ukrainian election

755
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:21,279
the other half of this campaign the

756
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:23,120
informational technical aspects however

757
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:24,480
i think haven't received enough

758
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:25,840
attention

759
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:27,840
that summer and fall the gre breached or

760
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:29,520
conducted reconnaissance at numerous

761
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:31,840
elections infrastructure targets

762
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,679
last year the senate's intel committee

763
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:35,279
concluded that gru operators had

764
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:37,440
performed reconnaissance on and in some

765
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:39,200
cases attempted to access

766
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:41,120
elections related networks and

767
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:44,320
infrastructure in all 50 u.s states

768
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:46,960
they targeted state voter registration

769
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:47,919
databases

770
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:51,120
state and local voting databases a

771
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:55,039
vendor of software used to verify

772
00:26:55,039 --> 00:26:57,279
voter registration data and election

773
00:26:57,279 --> 00:26:58,480
administration

774
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:01,919
organizations and personnel other than

775
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:03,840
exfiltrating some voter registration

776
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:04,880
data which is

777
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:06,720
generally public information to begin

778
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,799
with there's no reporting that they

779
00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:12,480
did anything with their access

780
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:15,120
but the ground was set to so fear

781
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:16,240
uncertainty and

782
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:18,240
doubt about voter access and the

783
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:20,000
legitimacy of the vote

784
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,399
perhaps not coincidentally that summer

785
00:27:22,399 --> 00:27:24,320
inauthentic social media accounts linked

786
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:25,200
to the ira

787
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:28,399
or the russian troll farm amplified

788
00:27:28,399 --> 00:27:30,399
statements by leaders of american

789
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:32,640
public discourse that there was going to

790
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:34,000
be large-scale

791
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:38,000
voter fraud and vote rigging finally

792
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,960
what does russia do when it gets caught

793
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:42,559
in the cold war the soviets often

794
00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:44,000
responded to foreign criticism by

795
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,080
charging its critics with doing the same

796
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:47,039
thing

797
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:49,440
you call us human rights violators are

798
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:51,279
you not a country that lynches black

799
00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:52,399
people

800
00:27:52,399 --> 00:27:54,720
russia and the gru did the same thing

801
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:56,799
when russia's state-sponsored doping

802
00:27:56,799 --> 00:27:57,440
program

803
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:59,919
was uncovered they leaked medical use

804
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:01,919
exemptions of athletes from russia's

805
00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:02,720
rivals

806
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:05,039
to which russian diplomats literally

807
00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:05,840
tweeted an

808
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:09,120
image of the word hypocrisy

809
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:11,840
well based on the mueller report on june

810
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:12,399
6

811
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:15,120
the gru intrusion at the dnc reached its

812
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:16,240
high watermark

813
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:18,640
and four days later the remediation

814
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:19,760
phase of the breach

815
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:22,000
response began kicking them out of the

816
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,120
network

817
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:25,120
the gre had already been caught and

818
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:27,200
needed to get ahead of the news

819
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:28,799
that they were interfering in the

820
00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:31,520
election perhaps not coincidentally on

821
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:34,720
june 7th gru front dc leaks began

822
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:37,760
leaking data from democratic or from a

823
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:39,440
democracy promotion group

824
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:41,360
open societies foundation which is

825
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:45,200
funded by george soros dc leaks noted

826
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:47,520
that its information its data showed

827
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:48,320
that

828
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:51,120
quote soros is named an architect and a

829
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:52,240
sponsor of almost

830
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:54,240
every revolution and coup around the

831
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:56,720
world for the past 25 years

832
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:59,200
the usa is thought to be a vampire due

833
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:00,799
to him and his puppets not a

834
00:29:00,799 --> 00:29:03,919
lighthouse of freedom and democracy

835
00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:06,720
then in october after the us publicly

836
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:08,159
accused russia of interfering in the

837
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:10,399
election the gru struck again

838
00:29:10,399 --> 00:29:12,880
as cyber burkut it leaked data from the

839
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:14,640
national endowment for democracy a

840
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:16,480
federally funded democracy promotion

841
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:17,600
group

842
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:19,200
this leak went right to the heart of

843
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,960
russia's counter-narrative

844
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:22,720
according to cyberbear cout their leaks

845
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:25,440
allegedly revealed covert u.s operations

846
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:27,760
to stoke protest movements and influence

847
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:29,360
elections worldwide

848
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:30,960
with an emphasis on upsetting the

849
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:32,960
russian political order

850
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:35,840
in short the narrative is how can the

851
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:36,399
u.s

852
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:39,200
say that russia is a bad guy for

853
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,880
meddling in u.s elections

854
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:43,200
if u.s funded groups also attempt to

855
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:45,600
influence elections

856
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:48,880
now now that we've looked at what the

857
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:50,720
gru has done during elections let's

858
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:52,320
consider how they could reapply their

859
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:55,279
other information confrontation tactics

860
00:29:55,279 --> 00:29:56,720
to elections

861
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:58,399
we've shown today that russian

862
00:29:58,399 --> 00:30:00,559
operations often play into existing

863
00:30:00,559 --> 00:30:02,000
narratives

864
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,600
consider them that in the last year

865
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:05,600
alone ransomware attacks impacted more

866
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:08,159
than 100 u.s state and local government

867
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:10,159
we know that the gre sand worm group

868
00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:12,000
really likes to use wiper malware and

869
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,919
has designed it sometimes to look like

870
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:14,799
ransomware

871
00:30:14,799 --> 00:30:16,720
such as in the not petty and bad rabbit

872
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:18,320
campaigns

873
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:20,240
it would be conceivable that this

874
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:22,000
scourge of criminal ransomware would

875
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,240
provide ample cover for attacking

876
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:26,080
election infrastructure like state and

877
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:28,559
local elections boards

878
00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:30,960
a favorite gru strategy to authenticate

879
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:33,200
and propagate disinformation is to push

880
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:35,039
information through publicly trusted

881
00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:37,039
sources such as government websites and

882
00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:38,720
the media

883
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:41,440
well one tactic the gru has previously

884
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:42,480
used was taking

885
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:44,960
over a maryland television station's sms

886
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:46,000
alert system

887
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,840
using it to send subscribers threatening

888
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:50,320
text messages seen here

889
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:53,039
this technique may might just as easily

890
00:30:53,039 --> 00:30:55,120
be used to send fake news alerts

891
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:57,120
consider how the gru planned to direct a

892
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:59,120
montenegrin political party to use its

893
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:00,320
whatsapp group

894
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:02,159
to organize a coup in response to

895
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:04,480
fabricated news

896
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:07,519
finally let's open the spectrum really

897
00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:08,640
wide

898
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:11,120
what else might be possible the gru has

899
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:13,120
twice disrupted election

900
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:17,039
electric disrupt distribution in ukraine

901
00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:18,799
would there be value in conducting such

902
00:31:18,799 --> 00:31:21,760
an attack say during an election

903
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:24,799
i don't mean like a countrywide blackout

904
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:26,640
but perhaps a low-key targeted

905
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:27,760
disruption

906
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:30,960
in localized swing areas if this were a

907
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:32,799
country where electronic voting machines

908
00:31:32,799 --> 00:31:34,799
are used it would force a last minute

909
00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:36,960
switch to paper ballots

910
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:39,039
it's easy then to imagine long lines of

911
00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:40,880
frustrated voters and dimly lit

912
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:42,640
schools and community centers trying to

913
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:44,159
vote

914
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:46,399
it may be easy to dismiss this as russia

915
00:31:46,399 --> 00:31:48,480
risking massive blowback if it were

916
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:50,799
to do this say in the united states what

917
00:31:50,799 --> 00:31:52,960
about other countries such as georgia

918
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:55,840
nato or any of the other non-nato states

919
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:58,480
with tense russia relations

920
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:01,440
now how can you prepare to defend

921
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:03,200
against such attacks

922
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:05,120
a good place to start is to recognize

923
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:07,679
that all adversaries including the gru

924
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:10,559
are goal oriented they typically work

925
00:32:10,559 --> 00:32:12,159
backwards from their objective to

926
00:32:12,159 --> 00:32:14,159
identify the most likely pathway for

927
00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:14,880
success

928
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:16,480
looking for the biggest bang for their

929
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:18,799
buck consider then what your

930
00:32:18,799 --> 00:32:20,799
organization has to offer

931
00:32:20,799 --> 00:32:22,880
don't take it personally oftentimes you

932
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:25,840
may just be a pawn in a larger game

933
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:28,480
look not just for at your own internal

934
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:30,480
assets like your data and platforms

935
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:32,480
but look at the role you play in

936
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:33,840
delivering services or

937
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:35,919
value to other organizations and the

938
00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:37,679
general public

939
00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:40,399
think about all the downstream parties

940
00:32:40,399 --> 00:32:42,000
and processes that you

941
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,799
impact then take a step back and

942
00:32:44,799 --> 00:32:46,880
consider what kinds of threat actors

943
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:49,039
may be interested in influencing any of

944
00:32:49,039 --> 00:32:51,919
those organizations and operations

945
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:54,240
many of the gre's operations begin with

946
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:55,600
existing narratives

947
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:57,200
consider the current zeitgeist that

948
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:58,880
drives popular discourse

949
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,880
especially around elections and current

950
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:02,960
polarizing hot button issues

951
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:04,880
it's much easier to confirm something

952
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:07,039
people already suspect than to introduce

953
00:33:07,039 --> 00:33:08,559
new narratives

954
00:33:08,559 --> 00:33:10,559
the gru often seizes on these

955
00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:12,480
opportunities to provide new information

956
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:12,799
or

957
00:33:12,799 --> 00:33:14,720
amplifies stories that undermine

958
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:17,519
confidence in and the reputation of

959
00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:20,320
leaders democratic institutions and

960
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:21,440
processes

961
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:24,559
and international partnerships

962
00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:27,679
examine how your informational assets or

963
00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:29,440
those of your downstream partners could

964
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:31,840
be used to confirm or amplify damaging

965
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:34,000
rumors divisive narratives and negative

966
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,679
perceptions

967
00:33:35,679 --> 00:33:38,880
finally look at campaigns around

968
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:42,240
the world that would be considered

969
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:45,039
targeting low-risk or traditional

970
00:33:45,039 --> 00:33:46,240
targets

971
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:48,080
how are your countries adversaries

972
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:50,080
already attempting to influence their

973
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:51,600
own populations

974
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:53,279
and their long-standing international

975
00:33:53,279 --> 00:33:55,200
opponents especially those with little

976
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,360
power to retaliate

977
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:59,519
operations tend to be bolder when

978
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:01,039
there's little chance of significant

979
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:02,320
consequences

980
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:04,399
even if the aggressor is ultimately tied

981
00:34:04,399 --> 00:34:05,440
to the activity

982
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:08,320
see montenegro if you know that an actor

983
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:10,079
has a capability or ttp

984
00:34:10,079 --> 00:34:12,560
consider it to be fair game potentially

985
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:13,280
for use

986
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:15,520
in other applications against other

987
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:16,480
countries

988
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:20,079
like yours so in conclusion

989
00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:22,639
election interference isn't just about

990
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:23,918
changing election

991
00:34:23,918 --> 00:34:26,800
outcomes attackers maximize the

992
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:29,280
strategic value of their tactics

993
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:32,879
targets and timing and strategic

994
00:34:32,879 --> 00:34:34,719
opponents demand strategic

995
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:37,520
defenses thank you and i look forward to

996
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:40,399
your questions

997
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:47,199
hi everyone i hope you enjoyed the talk

998
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:49,199
uh see we've got a lot of

999
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:53,040
questions going on in the q a so

1000
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:56,320
i just want to tackle a few of them here

1001
00:34:56,320 --> 00:35:00,160
uh so let's see what do we have here we

1002
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:02,000
have a question about

1003
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:05,040
uh what

1004
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:07,520
are uh some of the other things that

1005
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:09,280
have actually been accomplished here

1006
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:10,000
besides

1007
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,400
actually you know if you're not actually

1008
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:13,839
getting your preferred candidates

1009
00:35:13,839 --> 00:35:15,119
elected

1010
00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:18,560
uh so i think one so we of course

1011
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:20,160
talked about in the presentation there's

1012
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:21,920
those three categories of

1013
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:25,599
uh the of actions that i think the gru

1014
00:35:25,599 --> 00:35:26,720
is targeting but

1015
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:28,720
i think the most difficult question here

1016
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:30,640
is actually evaluating

1017
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:34,160
whether or not uh the gru

1018
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:36,240
the russian view about how to take

1019
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:38,240
action whether or not it's actually

1020
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:40,480
having an impact you know it's very

1021
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:41,760
difficult to say whether

1022
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:44,560
x caused why it's a classical political

1023
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:45,680
science problem

1024
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:48,560
but to speak anecdotally uh you know i

1025
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:50,000
mean how many of us

1026
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,839
uh security professionals have been

1027
00:35:51,839 --> 00:35:53,280
asked by our friends

1028
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:56,400
colleagues family uh you know did

1029
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:58,160
you know especially our families the you

1030
00:35:58,160 --> 00:35:59,680
know did uh

1031
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:02,800
did the russians hack the election and

1032
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:05,839
you know there's no actual evidence that

1033
00:36:05,839 --> 00:36:06,640
i've seen

1034
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:08,880
there you know votes were ever changed

1035
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:10,240
in this election

1036
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:12,320
uh you know the real vote totals much

1037
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:14,160
less in any of these other examples we

1038
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:15,040
looked at but

1039
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:17,280
the fact that this question continues to

1040
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:19,200
be asked again and again i think

1041
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:21,839
really exemplifies this problem that

1042
00:36:21,839 --> 00:36:22,480
people

1043
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:25,839
did have vote they did have doubts sewn

1044
00:36:25,839 --> 00:36:26,960
in their minds

1045
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:30,720
and that is a goal that we assess

1046
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:34,320
is of the russian uh you know election

1047
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:36,640
interference activities

1048
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:40,560
uh so let's see another question

1049
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:44,560
we have uh question what is the role

1050
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:45,280
that the us

1051
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:48,320
military has in all of this

1052
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:51,359
well i think first and foremost it's

1053
00:36:51,359 --> 00:36:53,440
that the us military

1054
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:55,920
is an intelligence arm of the united

1055
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:57,839
states you know that is task mother

1056
00:36:57,839 --> 00:36:59,200
thing among other things

1057
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:02,240
with monitoring the capabilities

1058
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:05,520
intentions and activities of

1059
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:08,800
its military competitors so um

1060
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:10,320
one of the critiques that it would you

1061
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:12,320
know you often get out of the

1062
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:16,079
2016 16 election was that the us was

1063
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:18,880
you know caught off guard if you watched

1064
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:21,520
chris krebs's presentation earlier today

1065
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:24,320
uh you know he was talking about how in

1066
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:25,839
2016 there was just this

1067
00:37:25,839 --> 00:37:28,320
general perception that there wasn't a

1068
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:29,040
threat here

1069
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:31,599
in the united states that it wasn't uh

1070
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:32,800
anticipated

1071
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:34,880
so something that the military

1072
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:36,400
absolutely has to focus on is

1073
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:38,079
identifying

1074
00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:40,880
what what is next what is the mil what

1075
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:41,760
are our for

1076
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:44,480
what are the us's foreign adversaries

1077
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:45,599
going to do

1078
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:49,040
how are they going to do it and how uh

1079
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:50,720
you know and what sort of evidence do we

1080
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:52,160
have you know that can lead us that

1081
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:52,880
conclusion

1082
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:55,280
and so what we need to do is look at

1083
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:56,079
those other

1084
00:37:56,079 --> 00:37:58,240
countries uh that are already being

1085
00:37:58,240 --> 00:37:59,119
targeted those

1086
00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:02,400
um you know what is china

1087
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:05,680
doing with taiwan what is

1088
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:09,680
russia doing in uh eastern europe and in

1089
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:10,800
other countries

1090
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:12,880
and how we can use that as opportunities

1091
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:14,640
to identify what are

1092
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:18,079
uh likely targets in the future

1093
00:38:18,079 --> 00:38:19,839
methods that are going to be used so

1094
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:21,920
that we can plan at a strategic level

1095
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:22,880
for

1096
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:26,320
what's next um

1097
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:29,440
let's see questions uh

1098
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:31,440
let's see we have a question about how

1099
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:33,040
do we deter

1100
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:36,880
uh so deterrence is a really messy

1101
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:40,400
issue in uh in the cyber community

1102
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:41,440
because

1103
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:43,760
so much what we're dealing with is

1104
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:46,160
subterfuge and espionage

1105
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:49,599
uh with a lot of not clear bright lines

1106
00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:51,920
so in deterrence it's a matter of

1107
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:54,160
shaping your adversary's risk

1108
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:57,119
calculus so if one wanted to engage in

1109
00:38:57,119 --> 00:38:58,800
deterrence need to be able to clearly

1110
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:01,359
state what are your bright lines

1111
00:39:01,359 --> 00:39:03,440
uh demonstrate you can actually you can

1112
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:05,440
attribute violations of those bright

1113
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:06,320
lines

1114
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:09,520
and demonstrate that you know you

1115
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:11,280
are willing to follow through and take

1116
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:13,280
actions on violations of those bright

1117
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:14,880
lines i'll leave it to

1118
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:16,960
the policy makers to decide what those

1119
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:18,480
bright lines are but

1120
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:21,760
if we if you know any uh country want to

1121
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:22,480
engage

1122
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:24,480
in deterrence you have to be able to

1123
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:28,640
take action on those three areas

1124
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:31,920
uh let's see what other questions do we

1125
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:33,040
have

1126
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:35,279
uh

1127
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:39,920
do you have slides and references uh

1128
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:40,640
this

1129
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:41,520
question do you have slides and

1130
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:43,200
references bill this will be available

1131
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:43,839
after the

1132
00:39:43,839 --> 00:39:47,040
presentation uh let's see

1133
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:49,119
other countries i think there was

1134
00:39:49,119 --> 00:39:50,960
something about that

1135
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:53,280
um

1136
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:58,320
how to deter uh

1137
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:03,599
other goals uh has the us

1138
00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:05,760
considered using these techniques given

1139
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:08,839
perceptions of success

1140
00:40:08,839 --> 00:40:10,800
um all right so

1141
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:12,560
given the perceived success of the greu

1142
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:14,079
and russia's operations in this area are

1143
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:15,599
we at risk of other national actors such

1144
00:40:15,599 --> 00:40:17,119
as china beginning to adopt the same

1145
00:40:17,119 --> 00:40:17,920
tactics

1146
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:19,839
uh i believe that is something that we

1147
00:40:19,839 --> 00:40:22,400
absolutely need to be on the lookout for

1148
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:25,280
uh you know they're you know for example

1149
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:27,520
china is something top of mind for me

1150
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:31,040
in terms of what has uh what have its

1151
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:34,640
groups been potentially doing to uh

1152
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:37,599
in inter-taiwanese relations with hong

1153
00:40:37,599 --> 00:40:39,119
kong with other countries

1154
00:40:39,119 --> 00:40:41,280
uh in terms of say influencing their

1155
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:42,319
elections or

1156
00:40:42,319 --> 00:40:44,319
say more generally about shaping the

1157
00:40:44,319 --> 00:40:45,359
information

1158
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:48,319
space uh you know in order to take like

1159
00:40:48,319 --> 00:40:49,359
firm action

1160
00:40:49,359 --> 00:40:51,200
uh you know it would be nice to have

1161
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:52,880
some public attribution to back it up

1162
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:53,280
but

1163
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:56,319
so for example the rumors about uh you

1164
00:40:56,319 --> 00:40:59,839
know say the wintee group going after

1165
00:40:59,839 --> 00:41:03,200
the nebulous winte group going after

1166
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:06,560
uh energy groups in

1167
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:10,800
uh taiwan uh uh basically

1168
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:12,240
whether or not they're going to engage

1169
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:15,359
in more uh destructive activities using

1170
00:41:15,359 --> 00:41:16,319
more gru

1171
00:41:16,319 --> 00:41:17,920
ways of using destructive activities in

1172
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:19,359
order to influence

1173
00:41:19,359 --> 00:41:23,520
uh the you know

1174
00:41:24,079 --> 00:41:26,480
strategic calculus of their adversaries

1175
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:28,800
that is something to keep an eye out

1176
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:32,640
on and

1177
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:35,520
all right so you know thank you everyone

1178
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:36,079

1179
