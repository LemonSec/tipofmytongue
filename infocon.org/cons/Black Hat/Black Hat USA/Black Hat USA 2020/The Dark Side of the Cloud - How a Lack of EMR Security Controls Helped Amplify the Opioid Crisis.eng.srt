2
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:14,400
the dark side of the cloud

3
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,239
how a lack of emr security controls

4
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:18,160
helped amplify the opioid crisis

5
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:21,199
and what we can do about it so

6
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:23,600
why are we here today the opioid crisis

7
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:24,320
has caused

8
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:25,519
mass addiction of prescription

9
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:27,760
painkillers tens of thousands of people

10
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:30,000
have died from opioid addiction

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,079
we've seen families broken apart we've

12
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:33,040
seen children

13
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:35,440
being born addicted i mean there's a

14
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:36,160
dedicated

15
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:38,160
daycare for children of addicts in west

16
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:39,440
virginia

17
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:42,000
the social support network that we had

18
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,520
it has been stretched to its breaking

19
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:44,000
point

20
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,440
if not beyond we have every reason to be

21
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:50,000
here today in every obligation

22
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,520
so why am i talking about this at

23
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:53,840
blackhead because one of the major root

24
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:55,360
causes of this was because of

25
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:56,879
underhanded manipulation of an

26
00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:58,160
electronic medical record

27
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:00,719
system that's normally used to assist

28
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:03,280
physicians in prescribing medications

29
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:05,040
so a few months ago in february an

30
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,640
electronic medical records company

31
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:09,439
settled for 145 million dollars with the

32
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:10,640
justice department

33
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,320
because they allowed the marketing

34
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:14,080
department of one of these companies to

35
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:14,479
me

36
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:16,560
to manipulate the system to recommend

37
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:17,759
their products

38
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:21,119
consistently people died and became

39
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:24,400
addicted because of this manipulation

40
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,080
and this subversive manipulation we're

41
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:28,080
talking about it's a security issue

42
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:30,159
and we have not addressed that for

43
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:31,600
smaller organizations and we're going to

44
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,520
go over that today

45
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:35,920
so who was the cmr company company's

46
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,280
name was practice fusion

47
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,200
they're now a division of all scripts

48
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,640
they started off as an independent

49
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:41,360
company

50
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:43,439
they provided an ad-supported free

51
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:45,119
electronic medical record system for

52
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:46,720
smaller practices

53
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,720
however this was not without controversy

54
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,159
in the beginning

55
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:52,000
they were considered controversial

56
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,520
because of perceived violations of

57
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:54,000
what's known

58
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
as the stark act and the anti-kickback

59
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,079
statutes because they were displaying

60
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:01,920
advertisements as part of the emr

61
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:05,040
and 2015 they missed their financial

62
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,680
goals their ceo and founder stepped down

63
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:10,000
and in 2018 they were acquired by all

64
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,319
scripts for 100 million dollars

65
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:13,680
under a cloud of suspicion of

66
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,680
investigations

67
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,239
our research showed it was 1 15 their

68
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:19,040
expected

69
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:23,840
market value so who were their customers

70
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,599
they had a lot of smaller practices that

71
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:28,080
couldn't afford the large emr systems

72
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,760
or to even lease them from the larger

73
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,840
providers such as upmc or mercy

74
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,440
technology services

75
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:35,440
they had a hundred thousand practices as

76
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:38,239
customers in 2018.

77
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:40,480
so here's some numbers why is this

78
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,319
important so part of our research we

79
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:43,680
took a look at the american medical

80
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,440
association's policy research

81
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:46,959
perspectives report on ownership

82
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:48,519
benchmarks

83
00:02:48,519 --> 00:02:51,519
56.5 of patient care physicians worked

84
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:53,680
in practices of 10 or fewer physicians

85
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:54,959
in 2018

86
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:57,760
and that's with a sample size of 33.39

87
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,440
and from that same source

88
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:02,560
54 of them own their own practice again

89
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:06,800
sample size 3 500. and from the ama's

90
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,040
policy resource perspectives report on

91
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:11,440
physician compensation but this is 2016

92
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,159
data didn't have 2018.

93
00:03:13,159 --> 00:03:16,319
64.2 of these owners based their salary

94
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:19,200
on personal productivity aka

95
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,680
seeing patients with a sample size of 2

96
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,519
900.

97
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:25,680
so what does this mean to us this means

98
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,200
that physicians they work to pay the

99
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,799
bills just like the rest of us

100
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:30,560
and their income is based on how many

101
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:33,680
patients they see and how much they bill

102
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,280
and the margins you have to hire

103
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,120
employees when the owners are working

104
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,000
that much

105
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,599
it's not going to be good enough to have

106
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:41,200
the specialists you need for an

107
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,879
electronic medical record system that

108
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:44,239
you're going to have in a large health

109
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:45,120
system

110
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,360
and in addition i want to put some more

111
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,360
sobering economic facts out there

112
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,720
according to our friends at the american

113
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,480
hospital association in their

114
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:55,760
2018 chart book 26.4 of hospitals have

115
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:56,799
negative total

116
00:03:56,799 --> 00:03:59,840
margins and 30.6 percent have negative

117
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,280
operating margins

118
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,519
this means a lot of hospitals out there

119
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:04,879
that you may go to

120
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:07,599
are losing money yet we have the same

121
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:09,200
requirements for electronical medical

122
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:09,920
records

123
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:13,120
across the board whether you're a small

124
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:16,399
practice or a large hospital

125
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:18,639
so what is an electronic medical record

126
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:20,320
i realize i got this far i didn't even

127
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:21,918
give you a definition

128
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:23,919
so this is a digital version of the

129
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:25,759
paper charts in the clinician's office

130
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:26,960
it has your medical and treatment

131
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,000
history

132
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,840
in one practice and it's got advantages

133
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,040
over these paper records

134
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:34,400
so for example they allow doctors to

135
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:37,199
track data over time identify who's

136
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:37,759
needed

137
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:39,840
to go see them for preventative

138
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,280
screenings or checkups

139
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,120
check to see how well patients are doing

140
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,560
such as on their blood pressure readings

141
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,000
or vaccinations or

142
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,160
overall physicals and monitor and

143
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,400
improve overall quality of care within

144
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,360
the practice

145
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,120
tied into an initiative from a few years

146
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,880
ago called core measures

147
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,639
they now also now interface with other

148
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:58,080
health systems payers

149
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,400
and business associates and as we've

150
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,919
seen with coven 19

151
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:04,080
also now medical devices and remote

152
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,240
monitoring systems

153
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,960
so how do they work how does a doctor

154
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,720
actually use this they can bring up

155
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:11,840
remote desktop

156
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:14,880
vdi or citrix interface they can bring

157
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:15,840
it up on the web

158
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,440
they have their mobile device apps or

159
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:18,960
their desktop apps

160
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,160
and there's a lot of interfaces they

161
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,080
have to other to med devices

162
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:25,039
billing systems and pretty much anything

163
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:26,400
you can think of

164
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,840
and they normally authenticate from a

165
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,680
central directory service

166
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,600
usually microsoft active directory

167
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,520
although you can authenticate off of

168
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:34,960
samba

169
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,639
they also have remote access from off

170
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:38,000
site and a major

171
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,840
demand has been for physicians to

172
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,840
complete charts after hours

173
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:44,400
so personal example i've worked on

174
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,960
several emr go lives of my career

175
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:49,280
almost every single time i have put the

176
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:50,240
mrn

177
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,800
it has come with a number of doctors

178
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,600
wanting me to help them get their

179
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,600
personal devices up and running so they

180
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,360
can access their emr because they got

181
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,919
four hours of charging to do tonight

182
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:04,080
and that's been a hallmark of working

183
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:07,680
with a number of people on medical staff

184
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:10,639
so we have some security holes we're

185
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:11,680
going to talk about

186
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,840
first of all emrs need to be certified

187
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,680
to be eligible for federal reimbursement

188
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:16,400
dollars

189
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,240
and actually for use to store patient

190
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,400
records so there's a

191
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,560
non-profit that does this on behalf of

192
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,840
the us government called the

193
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,759
certification commission on health

194
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:28,240
information technology

195
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,720
however this is only the one part you

196
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,240
can't just use a certified system and

197
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,280
get money

198
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:35,039
you have to complete annual risk

199
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:36,880
assessments and complete your risk

200
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:37,840
management plans

201
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:40,319
and follow up on your security findings

202
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:40,880
failure

203
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:43,039
to do so will result in fines from our

204
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:45,280
friends at the office for civil rights

205
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,120
of the department of health and human

206
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,680
services

207
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:52,800
so we took a deeper look at this

208
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,560
because we're not going to sit there and

209
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,479
just not give you data

210
00:06:56,479 --> 00:06:58,160
we went through every health and human

211
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,599
services press release on hipaa

212
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:01,840
settlements issued since 2015 from their

213
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:02,720
websites

214
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,880
and we identified the following five key

215
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,319
factors that

216
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:09,039
were and were for ocr penalties number

217
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:09,520
one

218
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:12,240
no risk assessment completed number two

219
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,560
no risk management plan completed

220
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,560
number three was not following up on

221
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:17,919
risk assessments

222
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:20,479
number four was not properly reporting

223
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:22,319
your breaches within 60 days

224
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:24,319
and finally number five was under

225
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:26,080
reporting the number of patients

226
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:26,639
affected

227
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:28,800
by a breach and many of these

228
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,319
organizations that we took a look at

229
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:33,599
were multi-billion dollar companies so

230
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:35,039
if these multi-billion dollar companies

231
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:37,199
can't do these five things

232
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:39,440
what are the odds of a smaller practice

233
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:42,240
being able to do so

234
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,680
if they're not doing these they're also

235
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,840
not reviewing changes to the emr system

236
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,120
they're not reviewing changes to

237
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,960
clinical decision support alerts they're

238
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:51,039
not reviewing who has access

239
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:52,560
and they're not providing relevant

240
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,639
training for the purposes other than

241
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:55,120
checking

242
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:58,720
a box and here's another complicating

243
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,000
factor i want to bring up and this is

244
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,280
something that's been actually been very

245
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,960
prevalent over the past few years we

246
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:06,080
call it pre-texting attack what we've

247
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,599
seen here is because of the large amount

248
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:09,199
of information that's made available

249
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:11,199
about our medical staffs on the internet

250
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:12,400
there's been a very sharp

251
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,639
uptick in pre-texting calls a lot of

252
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:16,160
these criminals claim to be government

253
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,919
regulatory agencies or professional

254
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:20,080
associations that call up

255
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,759
asking people to update their

256
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:24,160
information using a spoofed caller id

257
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,639
or emails i've personally seen state

258
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:28,560
agencies get spoofed

259
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:31,440
and emails they get some pretty similar

260
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,039
looking domain names

261
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:34,880
and it's not difficult to get personal

262
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,559
info using this method

263
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:38,479
and it's not difficult to call up a help

264
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:40,159
desk when you have all this personal

265
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:41,760
information to get a hold of someone's

266
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,279
username and password

267
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:46,080
and therefore get yourself system access

268
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,200
so as my friends

269
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,800
the underpants gnomes will be glad to

270
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:51,360
hear there is a phase two

271
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,200
phase one get national practice

272
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,880
identifiers and public information from

273
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,000
the internet

274
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,640
number two call practices and get

275
00:08:58,640 --> 00:08:59,600
personal info

276
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,399
using spoofed caller ids and number

277
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:03,120
three

278
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,279
profit especially when the practice

279
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:08,160
doesn't have two-factor authentication

280
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,920
what are some of your other complicating

281
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,200
factors

282
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,040
number one is the lack of two-factor

283
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:15,279
authentication for system access

284
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:18,320
while the actual prescription process

285
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,320
needed to prescribe opioids requires

286
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,160
two-factor authentication

287
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:25,279
based system access often doesn't that

288
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:26,560
means you can make changes to those

289
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,080
processes requiring this

290
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,000
with not actually needing two-factor

291
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,600
authentication to do so

292
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,200
including administrative access to the

293
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,880
emr this

294
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:37,760
is not a failing of the emr itself this

295
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:38,000
is

296
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,839
a failure in how we protect them

297
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:44,560
isn't this just theoretical no practice

298
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:45,600
fusion gave us a

299
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,399
pretty much a clinic on how to do it and

300
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:48,880
this

301
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,720
was very significant because it revealed

302
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,959
flaws in how we secure emrs that we're

303
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:54,780
going to talk about how to fix today

304
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:55,920
[Music]

305
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:58,240
so who were they again companies started

306
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:00,320
in 2005 by ryan howard

307
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,399
definitely not the ex phillies mvp

308
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:04,000
provided that ad supported free

309
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,480
emr to doctors in the cloud which meant

310
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,240
less it investment

311
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,760
which is key when two-thirds of your

312
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:12,160
salary is based on seeing patients

313
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,760
you have to see a lot of patients to

314
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:16,079
afford i.t and keep the lights on

315
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:17,600
so a little bit of personal background

316
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,040
here i worked in the doctor's office

317
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:21,040
about 17 years ago

318
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:22,320
one of the items i remember at the

319
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,399
doctor's office is the doctor himself

320
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:27,040
was running from office to office like

321
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,320
ping pong

322
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,279
because he was seeing a patient every 20

323
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:33,519
minutes and there were two other doctors

324
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:36,640
seeing patients with him so the amount

325
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,160
of work it takes to

326
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,640
run a small physician practice is not

327
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:41,920
appreciated

328
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:44,560
no one there is lazy it is absolutely

329
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:45,680
crazy

330
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:48,079
they have to keep people paid and the

331
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:49,600
only way to do it is by seeing more and

332
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,720
more patients

333
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,720
burnout with a small physician practice

334
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:53,760
is very

335
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:56,240
real and the truth is if you're spending

336
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,839
money to keep that office staff and you

337
00:10:57,839 --> 00:10:59,200
have to run around like that to make

338
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,079
money

339
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:02,240
you're not spending money on compliance

340
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,959
and you're not affording a high-end emr

341
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:06,720
and again most of the revenue for a

342
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,079
practice fusion according to the

343
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:09,120
washington post

344
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:12,000
came from advertisements that's a

345
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,200
problem isn't it

346
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,640
so according to the anti-kickback

347
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:17,440
statute 42us 30 1320a

348
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:21,200
7bb yes the translation of the paragraph

349
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,560
i have right there is

350
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,560
ads in the product used to receive money

351
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,480
from federal incentive programs is going

352
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,399
to land you in serious trouble

353
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:31,600
because it could influence how the

354
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:32,160
service

355
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:35,040
is provided that's essentially what it

356
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,640
comes down to

357
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,160
you put ads in there you have a chance

358
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,680
of influencing how

359
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:42,640
federal money is being used and not in a

360
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,800
good way

361
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,880
so another line of business practice

362
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,480
fusion had according to the department

363
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,320
of justice settlement

364
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,720
was by marketing themselves to drug

365
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,160
manufacturers as

366
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,600
willing to customize the clinical

367
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,839
decision support alerts

368
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:00,399
now pharma company x according to this

369
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:01,040
settlement

370
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:03,279
paid a million dollars to add a custom

371
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:05,040
clinical decision support alert to their

372
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,320
emr

373
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,760
and the reason we're not naming that

374
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,360
company is because first of all the

375
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,160
justice department

376
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:13,200
has it second of all there's four

377
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,399
companies in that space

378
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:17,519
we want to give you the right answer and

379
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:19,839
third of all as part of the settlements

380
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:22,000
practice fusion is being required by law

381
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:22,480
to make

382
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,320
officers and anyone else involved in the

383
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:27,200
company available to doj as part of this

384
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,560
investigation

385
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,480
which means the company is under an

386
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,560
active criminal investigation

387
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,560
so why is this important because these

388
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,639
alerts they paid a million dollars for

389
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:39,440
written by marketing people recommended

390
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:42,040
extended release opioids to doctors

391
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:46,000
230 million times between july 2016

392
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,279
and the spring of 2019 and they were

393
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:51,120
able to statistically prove

394
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:53,360
that doctors who received these alerts

395
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,680
prescribed extended release opioids

396
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:59,120
at a higher rate than those that didn't

397
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,639
so a little bit of background look i

398
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:02,560
came from philly i came from philly back

399
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:03,519
when they had an

400
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:06,720
opioid crisis in the late 90s extended

401
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,639
release opioids were killing

402
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:12,000
teenagers back then and

403
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,200
what they called an oxy80 back in philly

404
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,600
caused a lot of teenagers to lose their

405
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:18,399
lives

406
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:20,720
so this is something that people from

407
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:21,440
the east coast

408
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:24,639
been seeing for years but unfortunately

409
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:25,839
the rest of the country is

410
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:28,160
now seeing what we saw that long time

411
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:30,000
ago

412
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,279
so deception equals death subversion of

413
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:34,399
this computer system

414
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:36,800
used to provide false information it

415
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,959
caused a false prescription of extremely

416
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:40,160
addictive drugs

417
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:43,199
in the middle of a crisis and i put this

418
00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:43,920
here

419
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,680
i wish they had the flash tag in

420
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:48,000
powerpoint because people died and

421
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,360
became drug addicts because of a

422
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,720
marketing department

423
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:53,360
i don't know a better way of saying that

424
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,279
and it illustrated a lot of security

425
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:56,480
holes that affected

426
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:59,680
smaller providers so how are we going to

427
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:01,040
address this

428
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,399
we're going to talk about how to do this

429
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:04,079
using four methods

430
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:06,079
first of all we're going to provide more

431
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:07,600
clarification of this

432
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:10,959
starkx safe harbors to allow larger

433
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:12,800
providers to provide cybersecurity

434
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,720
services to smaller ones

435
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,079
we're going to talk about having smaller

436
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:17,839
providers leverage the resources of

437
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:20,160
smaller one of larger ones to provide

438
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,839
clinical decision support services to

439
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:23,680
their emr instances

440
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:25,360
and we're going to include privacy and

441
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,279
monitoring services as part of the

442
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:29,360
bundles of services sold

443
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:30,880
and we're going to talk about how we can

444
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,959
increase security in the emr itself to

445
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:33,519
require

446
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:35,839
two-factor authentication and increased

447
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:37,760
logging around creating alerts

448
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:41,519
or making these configuration changes

449
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:44,959
so we found three parts of the starcat

450
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:47,519
safe harbor wording that were relevant

451
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:48,959
first one requires

452
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:50,959
fair market remuneration for equipment

453
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:53,199
rental it is not based on the volume or

454
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:55,040
value of referrals

455
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:57,760
second one is that they require fair

456
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:58,240
market

457
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:00,000
value remuneration for management

458
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,160
services and the third requires that

459
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:03,040
practices pay

460
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:07,120
15 of the cost of services up front

461
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,720
have you seen what privacy and security

462
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,800
software costs lately

463
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,320
have you worked in a small doctor's

464
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:15,360
office asking someone to pay 15

465
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,199
up front for some of these services

466
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:19,680
that's not going to happen

467
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:22,320
that is the number of practices are

468
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,440
going to do this

469
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:27,440
is asymptotically approaching zero

470
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:30,240
so what's being proposed in october of

471
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,920
2019 the department of health and human

472
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,759
services proposed an amendment

473
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:36,240
to these laws i just talked about to

474
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:38,079
allow for a donation of cyber security

475
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:39,519
products and services

476
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:41,839
however this did not allow for patching

477
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:42,959
maintenance or hardware

478
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:45,440
aka will give you equipment but you

479
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,120
can't update it

480
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:50,000
as we've seen with a number of issues

481
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,759
very specifically the fact that

482
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:53,759
windows 7 is no longer supported that's

483
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:55,920
a losing proposition

484
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,839
so in january 2020 our friends at the

485
00:15:57,839 --> 00:15:59,440
health sector coordinating council

486
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,040
proposed some further amendments

487
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:04,079
including allowing for a donation of

488
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:05,199
patching and maintenance

489
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:07,120
allowing for donation of hardware and

490
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:09,120
more importantly liability protection

491
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:10,240
for donors

492
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:12,399
aka we give a smaller practice something

493
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:13,360
and something happens

494
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:16,240
they can't sue us

495
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:19,600
so we didn't think this went far enough

496
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:22,079
so we're going to propose two further

497
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:23,360
amendments

498
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:25,519
first one is to include the version

499
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:26,720
monitoring software

500
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:29,519
as part of cyber security services and

501
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:31,279
to allow for donation of services to

502
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:32,959
include drug diversion monitoring and

503
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:33,680
practices

504
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:36,160
and alerts of potential issues a lot of

505
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:38,000
larger health systems are putting this

506
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,040
in already excellent excellent software

507
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,320
cuts the time for diversion

508
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,920
investigation down from

509
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:47,759
a month to literally less than a day

510
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:50,000
and privacy monitoring a lot of

511
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,399
practices don't have this

512
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:53,920
and you ought to be able to have the

513
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:55,839
practices to be able to monitor and be

514
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:57,759
alerted to potential patient privacy

515
00:16:57,759 --> 00:16:59,279
violations

516
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:01,360
and have this donated so they can

517
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,959
actually do so

518
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:05,679
why why is this important the link below

519
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:07,039
talks about a case that happened in

520
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:08,799
florida where a woman was just sentenced

521
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:10,480
to a couple of years in prison

522
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:12,720
because she worked at a bunch of smaller

523
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,000
practices

524
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,799
and what she would do is she would take

525
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:18,240
pictures on her smartphone

526
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:20,880
of the patient's personal information so

527
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,720
what she ended up doing is

528
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:24,400
taking his personal information and

529
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,400
committing identity theft

530
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:29,760
why is this relevant because they

531
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:32,240
found out about this from a confidential

532
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:34,160
informant

533
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:37,919
not from the emr not from the practices

534
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:40,320
somebody who told the police they saw

535
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:42,000
the records

536
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,200
no practice even knew she was doing this

537
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,039
and if a confidential informant has to

538
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:48,799
be notifying

539
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:50,480
the practices and the police of what's

540
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,400
going on there's a really

541
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:55,440
big problem

542
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:58,240
so brings us to larger providers

543
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:59,919
leverage the partnerships or reseller

544
00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:00,720
agreements with

545
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,160
larger health systems or service

546
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:04,799
organizations to use their emrs

547
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:07,840
why because a doctor that is literally

548
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:09,919
ping-ponging between offices

549
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:11,200
is not going to be spending that much

550
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,880
time monitoring the cds alerts they're

551
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:15,039
going to pay someone else to do it

552
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:17,679
use their expertise use their staffing

553
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:19,600
pay them for the service

554
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,440
to help monitor these alerts and

555
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,440
leverage their order sets and alerts to

556
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:23,919
reduce

557
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:26,320
opioid prescriptions a number of the

558
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:27,840
larger health systems in the united

559
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:28,960
states

560
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:31,280
have done significant work and have

561
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:33,120
great programs

562
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:34,960
that reduce the amount of opioid

563
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,480
prescriptions

564
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,240
and they're worked on by some of the top

565
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:39,840
emergency medicine

566
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:41,440
and addiction medicine physicians in the

567
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,280
country leverage

568
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:46,080
that whenever you can because you're not

569
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:48,880
going to be able to do what they do

570
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:51,600
and privacy and diversion monitoring

571
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:52,559
services i

572
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:54,559
was doing a lot of research in this and

573
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:56,000
could only find the most

574
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,799
recent survey from 2016 was from the

575
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:00,799
ponemon institute which indicated that

576
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:03,280
56 of providers had sufficient privacy

577
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:04,799
protection

578
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:06,160
however when you took a look at the

579
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:08,000
actual data behind it two percent of

580
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,919
respondents to that survey with a sample

581
00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:11,120
size of 90

582
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:13,280
were from organizations less than 100

583
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:14,720
people

584
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,799
so brings me to a point about health

585
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:18,799
care a lot of the benchmark surveys

586
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:20,400
are normally based towards larger

587
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,880
institutions which means we don't have

588
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:25,360
data demonstrating the real situation

589
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:26,640
and we've got to make sure that these

590
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,799
services are being offered to smaller

591
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:30,320
practices

592
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:33,600
and diversion monitoring is new however

593
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:36,080
there is a demonstrated need for this

594
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:38,720
and practices

595
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:41,600
and brings us to privacy and diversion

596
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:42,720
monitoring

597
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,640
you can't talk about security on its own

598
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,400
without these two

599
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,559
you're protecting against malware worms

600
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:50,160
and ransomware we're doing a pretty good

601
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,679
job of it actually

602
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:53,360
however we're not protecting against

603
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:55,280
identity theft diversion and their

604
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:56,880
cascading effects

605
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:59,280
and definitely as we just explained not

606
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:00,960
curious team members looking at medical

607
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:02,799
records and using that info for their

608
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:05,360
personal gain

609
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:08,480
so i want to start off here and say i've

610
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,159
worked with most of the major emr

611
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:12,000
companies

612
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,159
they have done an incredible job

613
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:15,919
improving security over the past five

614
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:17,760
years i've actually

615
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:19,919
they have to be applauded for the work

616
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:21,679
they've done

617
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:24,400
and they've taken this from being mainly

618
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,720
desktop-based applications to

619
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:28,960
best-in-class and security in a number

620
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:31,039
of areas

621
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:33,200
and we have two-factor authentication

622
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,120
for prescribing opioids and we have a

623
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:36,480
lot of great companies selling great

624
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:37,679
solutions for it

625
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:39,440
however we still have room for

626
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:42,799
improvement we can't rest on our laurels

627
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:44,640
and talk about emr security we'll talk

628
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:47,200
about four areas we can improve on

629
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,039
number one is obviously requiring that

630
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:50,960
two-factor authentication

631
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:52,799
to make administrative reconfiguration

632
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:55,440
changes not just prescribing

633
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:57,280
we need to limit who can make changes in

634
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:59,200
emr so

635
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:01,120
as part of your cyber security services

636
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:02,799
provided you need to have this in there

637
00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:04,960
and again another real life example

638
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:07,360
i'm going to talk about was with a

639
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:09,440
radiologist i worked with

640
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:11,919
we were talking about pax security and

641
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:13,520
pax authentication

642
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:15,600
and one of the items he brought up was

643
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,919
that normally in a lot of these types of

644
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:19,039
systems

645
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:21,440
you give excessive access so people can

646
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:24,320
get access to what they need

647
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:26,480
so part of that comes when you give

648
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:28,320
access to somebody to make a change in

649
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:29,440
one area

650
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:31,360
you can actually also give them access

651
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:33,679
to make changes to clinical content

652
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:36,080
that was what this doctor had pointed

653
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:37,440
out to me

654
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:39,360
so we need to be very clear about who

655
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:41,039
has access to make changes and make sure

656
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:41,919
we don't have any

657
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:45,120
quote-unquote hidden surprises because

658
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:46,720
we gave someone access to a certain

659
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:48,000
screen

660
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,679
well now they have access to make rules

661
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:51,440
changes and alerts changes

662
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:54,640
so yes this really does happen and we

663
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:55,919
also have to make sure

664
00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:58,159
that we provide good configuration

665
00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:01,039
change reports of what changes were made

666
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:02,880
right now a lot of larger organizations

667
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:05,039
rely on their internal governance to be

668
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:05,919
able to do

669
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:08,880
change management properly what that

670
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,640
means for us

671
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:13,200
is that people are not getting human

672
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,799
readable results out and they're relying

673
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:15,520
on systems

674
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:18,640
outside the emr to do so there's not a

675
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:20,000
very very simple way

676
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,919
for somebody to hit a button and get

677
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:23,440
that report that says

678
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:25,360
these were the following changes made in

679
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:26,799
the past week

680
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:28,000
so we need to be able to get that

681
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,840
configuration change report that shows

682
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:30,720
who changed

683
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:33,360
what so you can verify it against your

684
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:34,159
existing

685
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:36,559
governance systems this is something

686
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:37,440
that i've been

687
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,840
working on a lot and also comes over to

688
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:42,159
user access review as well

689
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:44,559
part of the hipaa security rule requires

690
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:45,520
us

691
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:48,400
to be able to review for access over the

692
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,360
past

693
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:53,200
year at least so

694
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:55,039
what we have to do there is get that

695
00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:57,360
report out there you can't have a staff

696
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:58,559
member that is

697
00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:01,679
overloaded take a look and see

698
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:03,760
oh these this access is right when i got

699
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:05,760
to look at 700 people

700
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:07,760
there's going to be errors you need to

701
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:09,679
make sure that you break things down so

702
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:10,960
that it's

703
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:13,280
better for the medical staff or better

704
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:14,880
for the administrators

705
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:17,120
that are overworked to be able to

706
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:17,919
actually

707
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:21,360
see what they need to do

708
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:24,799
and the user interface biggest challenge

709
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:26,400
in security

710
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,960
but we need to improve that and we need

711
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:30,960
to also continue to work with providers

712
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,480
to ensure that their access to their

713
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:33,120
systems

714
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:36,320
is fully secured and using two-factor

715
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:39,440
authentication it's too easy to do a

716
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:41,120
pre-texting attack

717
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:43,120
and it's too easy to get access to a

718
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:44,320
system

719
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:47,520
and yes two-factor does help i always

720
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:49,200
reference microsoft in their

721
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,440
presentation at rsa earlier this year

722
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:54,080
discussing how out of all the account

723
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:56,039
compromises

724
00:23:56,039 --> 00:23:58,320
99.9 percent of them occurred with

725
00:23:58,320 --> 00:23:59,360
people

726
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:01,360
that did not have two-factor

727
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:02,559
authentication

728
00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:04,240
when your sample size is a billion

729
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:05,679
accounts

730
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:09,360
that's a pretty good sample size

731
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:11,520
so we have to work to make sure that

732
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:14,000
access is secured and using two-factor

733
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:14,880
authentication

734
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:18,159
even with smaller practices

735
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:20,559
so what are our takeaways biggest one

736
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:22,000
right here is that

737
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,320
smaller practices are more susceptible

738
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:25,760
to electronic subversion of their

739
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:27,360
critical systems because

740
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:29,840
there's a lack of resources to actually

741
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:32,240
take a look at how they operate so in

742
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:33,919
other words it's easy to make changes

743
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:36,240
when you know no one's looking

744
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:37,760
and you need to have those partnerships

745
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:39,440
with the larger health systems

746
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:41,039
because it's key to addressing the

747
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:42,720
resource needs

748
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:45,440
to properly operate an emr not just with

749
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:47,919
cyber security but also with governance

750
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:50,320
management and avoiding subversion like

751
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:51,440
exactly

752
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:54,480
what happened here this was a case of

753
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:56,159
a company taking advantage of the fact

754
00:24:56,159 --> 00:24:58,799
they knew no one was looking

755
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:01,840
and well they did what they did with

756
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:03,760
tragic consequences

757
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:07,039
and also getting that stark provision

758
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:08,480
for cyber security

759
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:10,799
getting some additional provisions for

760
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:12,720
privacy and diversion monitoring added

761
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:14,240
so that we can help out those smaller

762
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:16,159
providers and help them address what

763
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:17,279
we've discussed

764
00:25:17,279 --> 00:25:20,640
along with security issues

765
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,240
this is where you see a lot there

766
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:24,240
because realistically

767
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:26,840
privacy and diversion software are very

768
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:28,320
expensive

769
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:31,039
and if we can get it in the hands of the

770
00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:32,559
smaller practices

771
00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:36,400
aka over half of the practices in the us

772
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:39,840
we're going to greatly help these people

773
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,520
understand what's really going on and

774
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:42,960
not have it so we have a case where

775
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,720
confidential informant

776
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,960
is informing the police who then have to

777
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:48,000
notify

778
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,520
medical practices of data breaches

779
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:53,600
we don't want to be in that place we

780
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:54,880
need to be in a place

781
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:58,080
where those people like that are caught

782
00:25:58,080 --> 00:25:59,039
immediately

783
00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:01,679
and aren't working the relationship

784
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:02,480
between

785
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:04,480
a medical practice and a doctor and a

786
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:07,039
patient is a relationship of trust

787
00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:11,279
and what we're doing here breaks trust

788
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:13,279
it breaks trust and it breaks confidence

789
00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:14,799
and we

790
00:26:14,799 --> 00:26:17,919
tell our medical we tell our doctors

791
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:20,960
everything about our lives they know

792
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:23,120
more about us than almost anyone else

793
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:24,640
they know a lot of very personal things

794
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:25,760
about us

795
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:29,520
and when you break that trust between

796
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:34,000
a doctor and a patient it's

797
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:35,600
there's no other way to put it it's

798
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:38,640
tragic and what we're doing right now

799
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:41,840
is where we are tactically enabling that

800
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:42,799
to happen and we

801
00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:45,360
need to stop that and we can also do

802
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:45,919
that

803
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:48,880
by improving security in several areas

804
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:52,080
with the emrs which we've discussed

805
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:54,960
so with that thank you very very much

806

00:27:44,399 --> 00:27:49,840
any further questions

825
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:56,080
paul thank you very much hi valerie you

826
00:27:56,080 --> 00:28:03,840
have a question

827
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:13,760
thank you rashid thank you very much

828
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:17,840
thank you robert

829
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:25,679
and so the question how do you feel

830
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:27,760
about the future of this problem i feel

831
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:28,720
that

832
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:31,679
we've made some significant advancements

833
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:33,039
here

834
00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:35,360
i think with the up with a lot of

835
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:37,679
diversion software that if we get it out

836
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:39,120
to the right people we have privacy

837
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:40,320
monitoring software after the right

838
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:41,919
people and we

839
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:43,679
get the appropriate staffing in place

840
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:46,559
that we can help manage this problem

841
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:48,080
and if you want a double system your

842
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:49,600
doctor's using valerie

843
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:51,840
ask them there's a few major ones out

844
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:54,559
there obviously the big three are

845
00:28:54,559 --> 00:28:56,799
epic cerner and metatech and there's

846
00:28:56,799 --> 00:28:57,600
also

847
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:01,279
ones like athena health but just ask and

848
00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:03,440
so sean my specific recommendation for

849
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:04,960
emr using the cloud is

850
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:07,520
partner with a good vendor that knows

851
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:08,480
what they're doing

852
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,320
or a partner with a larger academic

853
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:11,520
health system that can help

854
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:13,520
that can help you because emr in the

855
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:15,679
cloud it's a lot more complex than

856
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:16,880
people

857
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:20,559
lead on so paul

858
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:22,080
also go into your question explaining

859
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:24,399
what the version software is the version

860
00:29:24,399 --> 00:29:26,399
software software that analyzes the

861
00:29:26,399 --> 00:29:28,640
transactions that take place

862
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:31,200
in an electronic medical record system

863
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:33,679
and oftentimes will reconcile them with

864
00:29:33,679 --> 00:29:36,159
a medication suspension system dispense

865
00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:38,480
dispensaries such as pixis or one of the

866
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:40,320
other products out there

867
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:43,840
to detect discrepancies so you're right

868
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:46,480
nina you're

869
00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:51,120
and so nina to make your answer your

870
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:52,159
question i've been answering the

871
00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:53,440
questions in the question tab as they've

872
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:55,600
been coming in as well

873
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:59,200
and so monaca you monitor configuration

874
00:29:59,200 --> 00:29:59,679
change

875
00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:01,440
electronic medical record systems are

876
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:04,000
required to keep logs of transactions

877
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:07,200
that occur that's part of the hipaa

878
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:08,559
security where you're supposed to keep

879
00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:10,720
those logs it's just supposed to review

880
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:12,640
those logs as well so that's how the

881
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,159
version software works it goes through

882
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:15,919
monitoring the same logs that you would

883
00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:17,520
for

884
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:20,720
activity or privacy monitoring so

885
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:21,200
