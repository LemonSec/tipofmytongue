2
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:17,199
my first call is lead paramedic

3
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:20,800
yeah it was pretty bad so my partner and

4
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:22,400
i we got paged out for

5
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:24,880
an altered mental status just outside of

6
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:26,320
golden colorado

7
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:28,880
pull up to this mobile home and the

8
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:30,080
patient's neighbor met us down the

9
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:31,599
bottom she called us in

10
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:32,960
because she'd gone in to check on her

11
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:34,960
neighbor and found her kind of

12
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:37,760
semi-conscious sitting in her kitchen

13
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:39,520
walk in and i can i can still picture

14
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:41,600
the patient sitting in a chair

15
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,520
it was on a formica floor in a very

16
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:44,640
well-kept kitchen

17
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:47,039
some of those 70s style tables that's

18
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:49,039
got the metal rooms around the edges

19
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:51,120
and from a distance it looked like it

20
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:52,079
was probably going to be

21
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:55,120
a diabetic emergency so this is pretty

22
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:56,960
straightforward for us to go ahead and

23
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,000
take care of

24
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,120
first thing i would do is check the

25
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:01,039
patient's glucose and if her blood

26
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:02,879
sugar's super low we give her what's

27
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:04,959
called an amp of d50

28
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:08,479
it's 25 grams of dextrose high octane

29
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:10,080
sugar that's so concentrated when you

30
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,520
put it in through the iv

31
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:12,960
if you actually mess up and miss you'll

32
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,040
kill all the surrounding tissue

33
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:17,360
well sure enough her blood glucose was

34
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:18,880
low and everything's going fine at this

35
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:20,240
point

36
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:23,520
then i really messed up

37
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:27,040
and everything went wrong i got it into

38
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:27,920
my head

39
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:30,240
that to treat the patient i wanted to

40
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:31,200
start the iv

41
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,880
and give her the d50 in the back of my

42
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:35,600
ambulance now there's reasons for this

43
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:38,000
that sugar is so pure it's very fast

44
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,520
acting but it also wears off really

45
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:40,240
quickly

46
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:42,159
so if the patient doesn't manage their

47
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:43,600
sugar for the longer term

48
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,280
they can end up right back where they

49
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,960
started and you really should be checked

50
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:48,159
out at the hospital

51
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:49,840
and the patient's not really with it so

52
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,439
she can't tell me we have what's known

53
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:52,640
as implied consent

54
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,759
that she doesn't want to go to the

55
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:56,240
hospital but if you've ever had low

56
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,200
blood sugar

57
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,439
you know how angry you get and so i told

58
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:00,799
my partner let's get her out let's get

59
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:02,000
her in the back of the ambulance i'll

60
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,200
take care of her

61
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,119
and she started fighting and the

62
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:06,960
neighbor is wondering why we're dragging

63
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,720
this poor woman out of her house

64
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:09,919
bringing her into the back of the

65
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:12,480
ambulance and it was ugly and i still

66
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,840
remember us just kind of pulling her

67
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:14,959
down the stairs

68
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:16,400
and my partner looking at me like i was

69
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:19,200
crazy because i was

70
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,200
because maybe i could have given her the

71
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,280
d50 in the house

72
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,440
her neighbor is right there and made her

73
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,840
a sandwich or given her a bowl of cereal

74
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,319
and kept an eye on her instead i made

75
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:32,160
that decision for the patient

76
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,000
put her in the back of my ambulance

77
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,200
started the iv

78
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:38,400
she wakes up and she is even angrier

79
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,519
albeit fighting us a little bit less the

80
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:43,440
reality is is i did not manage that call

81
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:44,160
well

82
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,680
that partner never wanted to work for me

83
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,360
again and i had actually caused me

84
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:50,080
problems in that job in the longer term

85
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:53,120
it took me about a year or two before i

86
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,640
think i became a competent paramedic i

87
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:55,840
went out to the east coast i worked some

88
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,599
high volume places like the jersey city

89
00:02:57,599 --> 00:02:58,959
medical center

90
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:00,720
before coming back to colorado doing a

91
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,000
little more work and then eventually

92
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,280
going back to college

93
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,040
and when i went back to college i

94
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:07,440
dropped down after my paramedic expired

95
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:08,560
to emt

96
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,480
so and got a part-time job as a pc

97
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:11,760
technician because it was just

98
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:14,080
really too hard to work as a paramedic

99
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,480
while going to school at the same time

100
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,159
but over those years i stayed active in

101
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:19,760
emergency services i did about five

102
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:20,319
years of

103
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:22,879
volunteer firefighting uh 12 years with

104
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:24,480
rocky mountain rescue group five years

105
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,239
on the copper mountain ski patrol

106
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:28,640
now 20 years as a federal disaster

107
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,599
responder

108
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:31,040
and for a couple of years i've been a

109
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,480
member of team rubicon and actually

110
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,920
deployed with them recently up to the

111
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,200
navajo nation

112
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,840
also got my paramedic back about two

113
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,120
years ago

114
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,680
so over this time period i built up my

115
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:42,720
it career

116
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:45,680
as well eventually starting securosis

117
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:46,000
and

118
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,280
the cloud security company disrupt ops

119
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:51,280
and i realize as i've lived these

120
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,879
parallel lives

121
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:55,280
one foot in emergency services one foot

122
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,720
in cyber security

123
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,799
that the lessons i was learning from

124
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:00,080
each profession

125
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,159
were helping me in the other profession

126
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:03,200
and to be honest

127
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,720
i think i got more out of emergency

128
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,560
services than i've gotten out of the

129
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,319
security industry improving my job as a

130
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:09,840
paramedic

131
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,280
and it's because there's a lot of

132
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,680
similarities between the two

133
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,120
i mean first of all they're both very

134
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,959
young professions

135
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:18,798
but when i first started getting

136
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:20,399
interested in emergency services i was

137
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:21,600
just a little kid and i was watching

138
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,080
this show emergency with johnny and roy

139
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,639
and it turns out that that was kind of

140
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:28,320
the start of paramedics in the u.s

141
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:31,520
back in the early 1970s that tv show was

142
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,120
actually about an experimental program

143
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,400
in los angeles

144
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,400
and that wasn't even covering the entire

145
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,880
city and if you tried to call 9-1-1

146
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,240
after watching that show

147
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,560
the odds were nobody's going to answer

148
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:43,919
even after the show went off the air in

149
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:45,600
1979.

150
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,919
so i became a paramedic about 20 years

151
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:50,000
after the profession started

152
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,759
when i started in security around the

153
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:53,120
year 2000

154
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,199
we were still in our infancy as a

155
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:56,720
profession as well

156
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,560
and we had really only been around for

157
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,880
10 15 maybe 20 years if you count some

158
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:01,840
of the government

159
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:04,720
aspects of it but that's just the start

160
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,160
of these parallels not only are both

161
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,039
industries

162
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:09,120
relatively new in security newer than

163
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,320
emergency medicine

164
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:11,919
we both have our roots in the government

165
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:14,080
and military ambulances start over in

166
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,600
the military in the battlefield where a

167
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,280
lot of what we have taken from i.t

168
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,160
security

169
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,600
actually started with government and

170
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,120
government computing systems because

171
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,080
they're the first ones that had the

172
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,240
money for computers

173
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,639
both professions also have their feet in

174
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:27,919
two different worlds

175
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:30,639
as a paramedic i split the difference

176
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:31,680
between the

177
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:35,280
fire and rescue world and the continuity

178
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:36,080
of care

179
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:38,320
and the medical world of in hospitals

180
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,759
and they're very very different

181
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:41,199
and that's really similar to how in

182
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:43,360
security we have the requirements to be

183
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,560
able to talk to and work with the

184
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,120
business

185
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,039
but we also the very technical aspects

186
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:48,960
of our job particularly those of us that

187
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:49,759
are dealing with

188
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:51,280
things like on the incident response

189
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,440
side and both jobs

190
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,919
are highly technical be it the years it

191
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:58,000
takes many months to years to learn how

192
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,120
to read an ekg

193
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,639
it's very similar to looking at packet

194
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:02,960
captures or writing code

195
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:06,240
and across both professions we deal with

196
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,639
incidents as well as longer term issues

197
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:10,000
although to be honest as paramedic i

198
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,840
deal more with the short-term incidents

199
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:14,319
but again in both there's the how do i

200
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:16,000
solve this problem today

201
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,479
to what are the larger issues that i

202
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:19,360
have to look i

203
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,919
look at to protect my organization or as

204
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:24,560
a medic to protect my community

205
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,919
but there's downsides to these

206
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:28,000
similarities the biggest being around

207
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:28,960
mental health

208
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:32,000
and burnout we have huge problems in

209
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:32,880
both fields

210
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:35,120
with burnout and with mental health and

211
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,479
i think it's worse than emergency

212
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:37,199
services

213
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:39,360
but we have a growing recognition of

214
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,560
burnout issues

215
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:44,000
in information security i think

216
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,600
the reason these two fields are so

217
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,000
similar is we share one really core

218
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,280
aspect the job is never done

219
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:54,479
we are always pushing the rock uphill

220
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:56,639
we're always treating the next patient

221
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:58,240
or solving the next incident

222
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:00,319
or securing the next technology and we

223
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:01,360
don't get that

224
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,039
same sense of satisfaction you might get

225
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:04,960
if you deploy a new application

226
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:07,360
or you release some new kind of business

227
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,400
product

228
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:11,280
and whatever our plans are in either

229
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:11,919
field

230
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:13,199
we never know when the meteorites are

231
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:15,039
going to come in and blow them apart we

232
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:16,880
don't really have full control over our

233
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,319
environment we're dealing with

234
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:21,120
a certain level of chaos and that takes

235
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,919
a certain kind of a personality

236
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:26,160
and so as i've lived both of these lives

237
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,680
and learned the lessons across both of

238
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:28,960
these communities

239
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,720
i think not only can we learn from each

240
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,800
other but i do think emergency services

241
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,479
is a little further ahead

242
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:36,400
uh the profession's just been around for

243
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,520
about 15

244
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,759
20 years longer than cyber security has

245
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:40,720
been around

246
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,800
and i think we can learn the lessons

247
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,160
from emergency services

248
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,400
emergency medical services and apply

249
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,400
those to what we do in cyber security

250
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,720
to improve how we do our jobs but also

251
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:51,599
to

252
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:53,919
help us in the long term to help us with

253
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:54,879
our mental health

254
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:57,759
and in the development of our careers

255
00:07:57,759 --> 00:07:59,520
i've realized that there's

256
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:02,319
four phases to our career in these

257
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:04,000
professions

258
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,199
and not everybody makes it through all

259
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:07,280
of these some of us stall out at these

260
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,479
different steps

261
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:11,520
and i recognize these earlier in ems

262
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,120
but i think they apply to security as

263
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,560
well

264
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:17,759
and the first one of those is enthusiasm

265
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:20,800
because when you first start the very

266
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,000
first time i sat on

267
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,479
as a paramedic in that right hand seat i

268
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:26,000
can't tell you how exhilarating

269
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,080
it was and yeah my first call didn't go

270
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,400
very well but eventually my calls did go

271
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,039
out

272
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:33,039
by the way it's really important to my

273
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:34,320
kids that i tell all of you

274
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,159
that that's our cat his name is goose

275
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:38,000
he's very cute and yes he does wear a

276
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,679
harness

277
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:42,240
when you first start we're really

278
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,000
enthusiastic because

279
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,839
we had to do incredible things as

280
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:49,680
in ems and particularly after i got my

281
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,760
paramedic i got to fly around in

282
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,040
helicopters and

283
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,640
drive around with lights and sirens and

284
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,080
sit in the back of that fire truck for

285
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,360
the first time with the air pack and the

286
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,399
bunker gear on

287
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:00,399
i mean this is every kid's little dream

288
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:02,080
or many kids dreams

289
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,839
when we first get into cyber security we

290
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:06,480
have a real similar

291
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:09,040
issue we are we we have real similar

292
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:09,680
advantages

293
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:11,920
we're dealing with aspects of technology

294
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,519
that others don't get to see or play

295
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:14,000
with

296
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,080
be it hacking tools and packet captures

297
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,360
and seeing everything that's going on in

298
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,720
our organizations

299
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,399
so we're really enthusiastic we're very

300
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:22,320
eager to learn and we really want to use

301
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,600
these new skills

302
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,959
i mean when i got out of paramedic

303
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:26,480
school i couldn't wait to innovate and

304
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:27,920
start ivs and when we come out of

305
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,600
security training you can't wait to use

306
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,720
those latest tools

307
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,320
and to run a penetration test against

308
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,920
your organization

309
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,920
we're also really flexible in this phase

310
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,839
our minds aren't really locked into any

311
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:39,279
particular way of doing things we're

312
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:40,800
still looking for role models we're

313
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:41,920
still figuring out

314
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,760
you know how the profession works and

315
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,760
and how the job works

316
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:48,080
which means we tend to be inexperienced

317
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:48,959
because we're new

318
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:52,399
very task focused very skills focused

319
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:54,240
so what are some of the challenges that

320
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,000
we face during this time and one of the

321
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,440
biggest ones is the skills without

322
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,399
context

323
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:01,120
it's the i want to use the new toys i

324
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,800
want to use the new skills

325
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:05,760
i want to innovate a patient while i'm

326
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,200
wearing full hazmat gear

327
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,959
and that's great i've never done that on

328
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:10,560
a real patient in my career

329
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:11,600
although some of those skills are

330
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,040
actually helping now during the covet

331
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:13,760
era

332
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:16,399
but it's the understanding when to use

333
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:18,000
these tools we don't really yet and we

334
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:18,640
tend to over

335
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,640
treat and we tend to overuse our tools

336
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,320
and tend to over rely

337
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,160
on our technologies versus seeing that

338
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:26,079
larger context

339
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:28,079
another really dangerous problem is

340
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:31,040
picking the wrong role models

341
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:34,480
people who are burnt out and cynical

342
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:37,680
they have a particular magnetism to them

343
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:40,240
they come across as the old crusty seen

344
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:40,959
it all

345
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:43,040
done it all they are the han solo

346
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:45,120
characters that we try to emulate

347
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,880
but the problem is is they're not going

348
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,240
to be good role models

349
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,320
they tend to think rigidly they have

350
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,279
kind of turned their brains up to

351
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:52,560
learning they're in this survival

352
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:53,680
mindset

353
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,760
and so we have to be very cautious who

354
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,920
we pick for those role models

355
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,519
and so to get through these challenges i

356
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:01,120
think there's some things we can do

357
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,720
that will not only help us through this

358
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,959
enthusiasm phase to move on with our

359
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:05,519
careers

360
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:06,959
but actually you're building the

361
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:08,640
foundation for

362
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:11,360
the rest of our time in the profession

363
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,240
one of the first is

364
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,920
you just got to know the job as a

365
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:16,079
paramedic i have to know my protocols i

366
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:17,519
have to know my drug doses

367
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:19,120
i can't be messing around with those in

368
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,880
the slightest i may not always know the

369
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,720
context i may go down the wrong protocol

370
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,160
i may mess up an assessment

371
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:25,680
but if i fundamentally don't know those

372
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,360
it's a problem and in security

373
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,720
particularly for those of us on the

374
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,079
incident response side

375
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:31,760
it's really important know our playbooks

376
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,440
nor run books know our standards know

377
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,560
our technologies

378
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,880
you just have to know those that's level

379
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,880
one for being able to move forward as

380
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,480
professional

381
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,240
now one thing that's becoming more

382
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,760
recognized in the medical community is

383
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:44,720
the use of checklist

384
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,160
particularly for complex and harder

385
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:48,079
procedures i know i've actually started

386
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:49,200
building a lot of these

387
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,800
when i do security work particularly

388
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,800
hands-on so that i don't miss steps and

389
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,240
i don't make mistakes

390
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,079
because no matter how much experience

391
00:11:56,079 --> 00:11:58,079
you have you might still make a mistake

392
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:00,800
this is a checklist built by a physician

393
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:01,200
who's

394
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,399
one of the probably the best in the

395
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:04,639
country at managing airways as for rapid

396
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:07,040
sequence innovation it's where we sedate

397
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:08,639
and then we paralyze a patient something

398
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:10,720
paramedics do it's something physicians

399
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,959
do and think about it they can't breathe

400
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:14,639
anymore so if i don't have every piece

401
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:15,760
of equipment i need

402
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,360
and through two or three layers of

403
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,120
backup equipment that i might need

404
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,800
if i screw up i can easily kill that

405
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,240
patient and

406
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,279
checklists are the kind of thing you

407
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:24,560
don't just use in the beginning of your

408
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:25,360
career

409
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:27,200
you can use them throughout your career

410
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,720
just go ask the nest pilot

411
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,160
next time you get on an airplane if we

412
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:32,240
ever get on airplanes again

413
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,839
now there's another skill that you want

414
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:35,600
to try to start developing at this phase

415
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:36,720
which is harder

416
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,480
that's the idea of zooming out is can i

417
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,160
take a step back and look at the bigger

418
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:40,880
picture

419
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,959
it's what i didn't do when i dragged

420
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:45,519
that poor woman out of her house

421
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:47,920
i was on a mountain rescue call once it

422
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:48,800
was a

423
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:51,440
kind of a sketchy on edge weather sort

424
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:52,639
of day and the call came in the

425
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:53,600
afternoon

426
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,200
for some people shouting for help

427
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,560
somewhere up in the mountains i mean

428
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:57,839
deep in the mountains just west of

429
00:12:57,839 --> 00:12:58,959
boulder colorado

430
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:01,040
and nobody saw anybody her they just

431
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:02,639
heard the shouts for help

432
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:04,560
so a bunch of us went out and me and

433
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:06,160
another gentleman were partnered up and

434
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,279
we went out we were one of the

435
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:08,639
we're the second and third people out

436
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:10,320
the door with some medical equipment and

437
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:10,880
clothes

438
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,240
we're thinking we're out for a nice hike

439
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,440
you get these calls all the time there's

440
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,560
no one there

441
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,160
well somebody ahead of us called out on

442
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:18,000
the radio they found two patients

443
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,519
we got there pretty quickly and i had to

444
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:21,360
do the medical assessment

445
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,360
my first patient had an injured ankle

446
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,880
second patient two injured ankles and it

447
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,480
smashed his chest these guys were

448
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:28,480
trying to slide down a permanent snow

449
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,160
field lost control and smashed into the

450
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:31,360
rocks at the bottom

451
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,880
and the second patient he was pretty

452
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,160
banged up and he was having trouble

453
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:35,279
breathing

454
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:37,600
i looked up at the sky and there's bad

455
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:38,800
weather coming in

456
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:41,600
and we're losing light so i went over to

457
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,040
the guy with the injured ankle

458
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:44,560
i didn't take his boot off i didn't

459
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,240
assess his ankle i just made sure there

460
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:46,959
was no blood

461
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:48,399
no bone sticking out look how i go can

462
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:50,320
you walk he goes yeah go good

463
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,600
go with this guy and hike down the

464
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,440
mountain stop if you need help and call

465
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,199
for it on the radio

466
00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:57,120
i zoomed out because at that point in

467
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,959
time the best thing for that patient

468
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:00,240
wasn't following my protocol and

469
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,920
treating that ankle which it turns out

470
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:02,880
was broken

471
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,079
it was getting him out of there as

472
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:06,160
quickly as possible before we had a very

473
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:06,959
complicated

474
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:09,680
complicated evacuation and the rescue

475
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:11,360
for his partner ended up being overnight

476
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:12,959
and almost resulted in a helicopter

477
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:14,959
crash

478
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:16,639
from the mental health side we also want

479
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:19,360
to start building our skills early

480
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,720
mental health skills need to be built

481
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,959
just as much as your technical skills

482
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:24,399
some of the things that can help find

483
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:26,639
positive mentors and make sure you

484
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:28,240
understand those procedures and

485
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:30,160
processes start learning why

486
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,600
you have those protocols the way they

487
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,040
are don't just know what the steps are

488
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:35,120
know why you have those steps

489
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,279
and start really learning continuously

490
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:38,399
don't assume because you got out of

491
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:39,680
school or you passed a few tests

492
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41,360
that you actually know what's going on

493
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:43,120
medicine changes technology changes

494
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:43,680
there's always

495
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,839
opportunities to learn new things this

496
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:47,279
is also really important time to create

497
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:48,560
biased defenses

498
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:50,480
now this is huge in all public safety

499
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:52,240
emergency services as we've seen in the

500
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,120
news lately

501
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,320
when you're dealing with certain user

502
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:56,320
populations socioeconomic and even

503
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,079
racial classes

504
00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:00,079
you can get a very biased view of them

505
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:01,680
because of the nature of only seeing

506
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,040
people at their worst

507
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:05,600
in security we face the same issue how

508
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,040
we look at our developers how we look at

509
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,399
different business units how we look at

510
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:09,920
auditors others in the business

511
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:11,760
i know we have a lot of biases i know we

512
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:12,959
like to victim blame

513
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:15,040
and the earlier you recognize this and

514
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,639
you don't get into that habit

515
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:17,760
the better and it's something you have

516
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:20,000
to fight all the time and then we want

517
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,279
to embrace this concept of

518
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:23,120
anti-fragility

519
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:25,519
if i'm resilient i can keep taking hits

520
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:26,399
and i don't change

521
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:28,720
it's like that simpsons episode where

522
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,240
homer simpson is fighting

523
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:33,120
the fake mike tyson and the only reason

524
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,240
he's in the ring is because he's the

525
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:35,120
only one that wouldn't

526
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:37,120
go three rounds without dying but if he

527
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,480
went to round four he'd die and

528
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,160
moe threw in the white towel and rescued

529
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:41,519
him with well they flew

530
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:44,880
out of the anyway it's the simpsons but

531
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:47,759
resiliency is you are inflexible and you

532
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:48,959
can take the hits

533
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:51,600
anti-fragility is all about thriving in

534
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,440
chaos and uncertainty

535
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:56,399
it's where you look for that uncertainty

536
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:58,000
and when something happens

537
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,079
you take the hit and you learn from it

538
00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:01,199
and you adapt from it

539
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:03,199
and you move forward and it really is a

540
00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:04,240
mindset that

541
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:08,079
mindset that i absolutely prefer

542
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:11,839
now the next phase is ego

543
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:13,519
as a paramedic this is where you're

544
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:15,920
going to get your first clean kill

545
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,279
this is where i'm going to make a

546
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:20,399
mistake because i'm burned out

547
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:22,000
what we found when i first started as a

548
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,839
paramedic i was told

549
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:25,920
average burnout per paramedic is around

550
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:27,199
seven years

551
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:28,720
nobody had done a study on that that was

552
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:31,040
just this person's experience

553
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:32,320
so if you think about it it takes you

554
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,079
one two three to five years to become

555
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:35,199
pretty good at the job

556
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:36,720
and then around five to seven years you

557
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,320
start burning out

558
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,160
and that's going to happen if you don't

559
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:41,360
actively manage

560
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:44,240
and try to prevent that burnout why is

561
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:44,880
that

562
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:47,920
well you've seen a lot and

563
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:49,519
a lot of things that are hard to handle

564
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:50,959
and so you you kind of stop

565
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:52,800
listening you jump to conclusions

566
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,959
because you're seeing this constant

567
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:56,639
repetition of the same things over and

568
00:16:56,639 --> 00:16:57,360
over

569
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:58,880
your sleep can be affected there's

570
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,639
exhaustion maybe it's because

571
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:02,399
of the psychological aspects of the job

572
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:03,279
or maybe it's just because you're

573
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:04,720
rotating shifts so you've got too many

574
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,720
pager calls in the middle of the night

575
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:09,280
this is also where having a beer after

576
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:10,000
work

577
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,280
may become more of a crux and a

578
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,199
dependency because you're now

579
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:15,760
abusing substances as a way to escape

580
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:17,199
from the burnout and your

581
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:18,000
dissatisfaction

582
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,919
with what's going on and you're just

583
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:22,079
caught in this endless cycle

584
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:23,679
seeing the same things over responding

585
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:25,839
the same ways over in a very unhealthy

586
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:27,199
cycle

587
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:28,480
we can measure this something known as

588
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,400
the mask burnout inventory i actually

589
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:31,600
learned about this from

590
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,120
a couple of people in the cyber security

591
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:35,440
industry jack daniel and josh corman who

592
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:36,880
both took time out to give me some

593
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,640
results of a survey that they did

594
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:41,679
around information security and

595
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:43,200
uh josh actually did a great

596
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,120
presentation in 2019

597
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:47,039
with dr maslock who created the burnout

598
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:48,400
inventory

599
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:51,120
what we found or what they found is that

600
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,320
in security

601
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:55,200
we hit all three criteria we're red in

602
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,160
exhaustion

603
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,919
we're red in cynicism to the point of

604
00:17:57,919 --> 00:17:59,200
where jack daniels says

605
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:02,160
cynicism is our core competence and

606
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:02,720
we're

607
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:05,919
low on perceived self-efficiency are we

608
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:07,679
feeling like we are making a change

609
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:09,520
that's actually split there are many

610
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:10,559
people in the security committee that

611
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:11,280
feel like they're

612
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:12,559
making a change those more in the

613
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:14,559
incident response side feel like

614
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:16,400
less like they're making a change and

615
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,520
burnout's something we have to battle

616
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:19,039
all the time

617
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:21,520
so how do we get through this ego phase

618
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:23,120
well it's a combination of

619
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:26,400
mindset and process on the mental health

620
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,840
side this is where we really have to

621
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,440
focus on the fundamentals

622
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:31,440
there's no surprises here people have

623
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:33,280
talked about this over and over again

624
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:34,960
you need to eat healthy you need to

625
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:37,200
exercise you need to sleep

626
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,039
you need to rely on more peer support

627
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:40,640
one of the great things that

628
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:42,480
we can do in some of the places i work

629
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:43,919
ems is for example

630
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:45,440
when i got back from my deployment to

631
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:47,039
puerto rico they

632
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:48,799
actually in the federal there was a

633
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:50,080
database someplace

634
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:51,840
where i got a call a month or two later

635
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,120
just to make sure i was okay with team

636
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:54,720
rubicon that's absolutely essential

637
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,320
there's like monthly buddy checks

638
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:57,600
to make sure people are okay and

639
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,919
mentally okay and picking the right

640
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:00,880
peers

641
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:03,120
can be a very large part of this if you

642
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:04,640
hang out with that cynical burnt out

643
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:05,760
crowd you're going to be cynical and

644
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:06,559
burnt out

645
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:08,000
think about it when you're enthusiastic

646
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,919
you're trying to impress those above you

647
00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:11,280
but when you've been around for a while

648
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,799
you're trying to impress those below you

649
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:14,080
and that can actually

650
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:17,440
get into this vicious negative cycle

651
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:18,960
and then having workplace support really

652
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,640
helps i think we're actually better

653
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:21,919
on this believe it or not in security

654
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:24,480
than in ems particularly some ems

655
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:25,919
companies do a really poor job people

656
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:27,679
don't get time off they're low paid

657
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:29,280
they don't get a lot of benefits and we

658
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:31,280
do we just have more money in security

659
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:34,000
than people in ems have which helps but

660
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,600
both industries also have toxic

661
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,280
environments and we need to recognize

662
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:39,520
that and try to avoid those if we can

663
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:42,559
because you know ego burnout these are

664
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:44,320
rivers that are constantly eating away

665
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:45,280
at our mental health

666
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:47,600
foundations and we need to constantly be

667
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,039
rebuilding and refreshing those

668
00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:50,559
foundations for our career

669
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:52,400
and this is why i say start with that

670
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,160
mental toolkit early recognize these

671
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,039
issues early

672
00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:56,320
be aware of them because it's going to

673
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,240
be a better chance to protect yourself

674
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:00,720
from them as you move forward

675
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,799
now that feeds into some of the process

676
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:03,919
issues because some of the problems you

677
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:05,280
make and the reason as a medic i might

678
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:06,000
get a clean kill

679
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,840
at this phase is i stop paying attention

680
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:09,520
and i stop the fundamentals i start

681
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:10,799
jumping around a little bit

682
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:12,400
because i now have the experience to do

683
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,240
that this is where what i call second

684
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:16,480
level pathways or protocols make sense

685
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:17,520
these are the kinds of things that

686
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,520
physicians are often very good at

687
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:21,679
that we as paramedics need to spend a

688
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:22,880
little more time with

689
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,320
this one's from advanced medical life

690
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:25,760
support and it's a patient assessment

691
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:26,400
pathway

692
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,320
to make sure we're both we're constantly

693
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:30,320
assessing and reassessing patients

694
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:32,240
and we're not missing anything it really

695
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:34,240
comes down to you know making sure that

696
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:36,240
we introduce the right kind of processes

697
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:37,760
and we stick with those

698
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:39,440
even when we start being very very good

699
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:40,880
at our job

700
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,320
information security we don't have a lot

701
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:44,159
of these we have some stuff

702
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:45,919
in incident response we have some

703
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:47,360
written technical processes

704
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:49,760
but i think it's a real big place where

705
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:51,520
we can grow as a profession

706
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:54,080
to start really operationalizing what we

707
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:54,640
do

708
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,799
in both generic ways and in the

709
00:20:56,799 --> 00:20:58,480
individual incident with the individual

710
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:00,400
technologies as well

711
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,159
and now at this ego phaso we are

712
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:04,000
competent at our jobs so this is the

713
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,280
time where we can really build some of

714
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:06,640
these advanced skills

715
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,640
uh i talked about zooming out keeping a

716
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,799
flexible mind continuous learning

717
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:14,000
uh doing drills and exercises this was a

718
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:14,960
great one we did

719
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:16,720
with federal government it was a top off

720
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,640
they called it where we did a simulated

721
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:20,240
weapon to mass destruction it actually

722
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:21,760
involved an attack in multiple states

723
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:22,720
throughout the u.s

724
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:24,799
so i got flown up to seattle and you can

725
00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:25,760
see that i'm in the

726
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:27,840
decontamination tent and our full hazmat

727
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,440
gear taking a picture of the bus that

728
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:31,280
they fake exploded and threw onto its

729
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:31,760
side

730
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:33,280
as we're treating hundreds of fake

731
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:34,880
patients those are the kinds of things

732
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,000
that really make a difference just

733
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,080
drilling in and challenging us mentally

734
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:40,480
to keep us on our toes so we have the

735
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:43,039
flexibility to adapt to new situations

736
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:45,360
and the decisiveness to make a decision

737
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:47,360
and actually act we had an exercise once

738
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:48,720
where the person running it

739
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:51,039
got mentally locked up things didn't go

740
00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:52,159
the way she expected

741
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:54,080
she didn't have that mental flexibility

742
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:55,520
as a result she didn't act

743
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:58,080
and that whole exercise fell apart

744
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:59,760
thankfully it was an exercise and not a

745
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:01,039
real situation

746
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:02,640
but i think we all know that it happens

747
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,720
in real life as well

748
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:07,760
the ego phase some people skip it and

749
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:09,280
some people never leave it

750
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:12,000
this is that really tough area and it's

751
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:12,720
the most

752
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,720
i think personally challenging

753
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:15,840
challenging phase to go into because

754
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:17,039
your ego gets pretty strong because you

755
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:18,159
know what you're doing

756
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:22,159
but you are also fighting those burn out

757
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:23,360
those mental health issues

758
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:25,280
and it can really be a bad combination

759
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,799
and it really comes down to your choice

760
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:28,159
do you want to move forward

761
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:30,400
or do you want to stay locked into that

762
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,320
negative cycle

763
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:33,840
because the next phase has its own

764
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:36,240
challenges and that's empathy

765
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:38,480
this is where you start seeing people as

766
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:39,600
human beings again

767
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:42,400
not as patients with vital signs one of

768
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,919
the first times this really hit me

769
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:46,159
was when i responded hurricane katrina

770
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:48,000
and we actually ended up in houston

771
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:48,880
where we

772
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,960
started off by triaging 900 patients in

773
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:52,080
three hours and they were helping

774
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:52,880
provide medical

775
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:55,039
care in the stadium where all these

776
00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:56,880
evacuees who'd come out of

777
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:59,520
new orleans had gone to and when i'm

778
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:01,280
dealing with 900 patients

779
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:02,559
in a matter of hours i have to do

780
00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:03,919
assessment after assessment after

781
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:04,880
assessment

782
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:06,559
it's important to remember that for

783
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:07,679
almost every one of them that was

784
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:08,559
possibly the worst

785
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:10,480
day of their lives that they were

786
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:13,200
experiencing absolutely horrible things

787
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,360
and really i'm not going to be providing

788
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:16,320
much medical care

789
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:17,760
most of them didn't need any medical

790
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,760
care but what i could bring in is

791
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:21,120
empathy and kindness

792
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:22,720
make them feel like human beings as

793
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:23,760
they're being shuttled around and

794
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:24,640
treated like meat

795
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:26,640
on these buses making just that small

796
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:28,320
difference in someone's day

797
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:30,159
when you start earlier in your career

798
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:32,080
you don't feel personally rewarded

799
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:33,280
by making those kinds of small

800
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:35,520
differences but i really think that

801
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:36,080
that's what

802
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:39,679
separates the true experts in our field

803
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:42,159
from people who are kind of younger and

804
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:43,919
earlier in their career

805
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:45,440
but it's tough because you have to learn

806
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:47,360
how to empathize without

807
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:49,200
sympathizing too much what's the

808
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,799
difference well

809
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:52,320
when i deployed down to puerto rico

810
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,840
things had been torn apart

811
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:55,760
and we ended up in a series of our

812
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:57,440
disaster response tents in the parking

813
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,799
lot of a hospital we were functioning as

814
00:23:58,799 --> 00:23:59,919
an icu

815
00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:01,919
we had a patient come in with diabetic

816
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:03,039
ketoacidosis

817
00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:06,080
uh dka which is high blood sugar versus

818
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:07,360
the patient i talked about earlier with

819
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:08,559
low blood sugar

820
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:10,080
and this woman she was actually from

821
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:12,400
florida she lived now in puerto rico but

822
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,480
she was originally from florida

823
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:16,320
of course florida we'll get there no

824
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:18,720
offense to our watchers from florida

825
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:21,760
but she came in with the high glucose

826
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,520
and she knew she was in a hospital and

827
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:25,520
she quickly became drug seeking

828
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:27,520
and she wasn't very kind to us as the

829
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:28,880
staff even though we were trying to

830
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,640
treat her dignity and respect because

831
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:32,080
however horrible it is in her drug

832
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:33,840
conditions and everything else

833
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:36,000
she still had probably lost her home

834
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,200
like most of the other people they were

835
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,400
dealing with and there was certainly no

836
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,720
electricity or clean water around

837
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:43,760
well at one point the

838
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:47,120
flight nurse and i who are treating her

839
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:49,760
talk to the physician assistant who was

840
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:51,520
responsible for her overall care

841
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:53,120
and he said just give her the meds or

842
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:54,640
like she's drug seeking you don't give a

843
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:56,320
drug seeking patient

844
00:24:56,320 --> 00:25:00,080
uh opioids and he goes look guys

845
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:02,559
we're not changing her life today we're

846
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:04,080
not going to change her life decisions

847
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:05,039
today

848
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:08,159
we need to treat her get her out of

849
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:09,919
our room open up that bed for somebody

850
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:12,240
else and us withholding that drug isn't

851
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:14,320
going to make that situation any better

852
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:18,000
and so we did and i learned

853
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,640
that day to be able to empathize and

854
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,400
treat her like a human being

855
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:24,960
without once justifying her poor

856
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:25,919
decisions

857
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:27,520
and this was hard because i was starting

858
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:30,240
to suffer from compassion fatigue

859
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:31,679
compassion fatigue is really different

860
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:33,919
than burnout think about it is we have a

861
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:36,000
gas tank for empathy we have a gas tank

862
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,039
for compassion

863
00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:38,320
at a certain point you're going to run

864
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:40,159
out of fuel and the more you get into

865
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:41,520
this empathy phase

866
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:42,799
the more that you're going to be

867
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:44,000
challenged with compassion fatigue

868
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,200
because you can't just close yourself

869
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:47,039
off like you do when you're burnt out

870
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:48,799
and compassion fatigue is very well

871
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:49,760
recognized

872
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:51,679
within the medical industry there's

873
00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:53,200
something in the compassion fatigue

874
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:53,760
project

875
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,440
i've got some links actually that that

876
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:57,840
will go out with this presentation

877
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:59,200
and a lot of it comes down to the

878
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:01,600
regular same mental health fund

879
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:04,400
fundamentals now with compassion fatigue

880
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,400
it can be very short term

881
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,880
i did not get compassion fatigue when i

882
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:10,000
was treating those

883
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,600
hundreds of patients from hurricane

884
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:14,640
katrina i did get compassion fatigue

885
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:16,320
from this one patient who was just

886
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:18,080
sucking my life out of me as i was

887
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:19,679
trying to deal with her and as she was

888
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:21,520
trying to get what she wanted

889
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:24,080
out of the system and so it's really

890
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:25,440
important to recognize that and i'll be

891
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:26,640
honest we're

892
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:30,080
really bad at that in security we

893
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:32,240
like to blame victims we like to blame

894
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:33,360
business units

895
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:36,159
when the reality is is in many cases

896
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:37,440
maybe they are making the wrong

897
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:38,320
decisions

898
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:39,679
but maybe if we listen and try and

899
00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:41,200
understand why they're making those

900
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:42,320
decisions

901
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:44,720
we can better manage the situations and

902
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:47,200
be better professionals

903
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:49,360
at this phase our skills actually do

904
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:50,799
really have the potential to start

905
00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:52,799
ramping up so if we can get through

906
00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:54,080
these mental health and the empathy and

907
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:55,039
the sympathy

908
00:26:55,039 --> 00:26:57,679
we know our fundamentals cold we

909
00:26:57,679 --> 00:26:59,200
hopefully are still learning we have

910
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,640
those flexible minds we've kind of

911
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:02,640
graduated from making those ego-based

912
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:03,760
decisions

913
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:05,279
and one of the things that we can start

914
00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:07,120
doing more is moving from pattern

915
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:07,840
matching

916
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:10,400
to reasoning this is something i'm still

917
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:11,919
really working on as a paramedic

918
00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:14,159
i think i'm better at it in security

919
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:15,440
these are those medics

920
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:16,960
when i look at them and if they hear

921
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:18,720
hoof beats they can tell the difference

922
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,880
between a horse and a zebra

923
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:22,960
from across the room because they're

924
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,480
actually able to think through

925
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:26,000
the situations instead of just looking

926
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,080
at the blood values and assuming

927
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:29,120
they are what they are they actually

928
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:30,159
think through the problem and understand

929
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:31,600
the physiology behind it

930
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:33,520
that really just does take a lot of

931
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:34,880
experience a lot of time a lot of

932
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:36,320
continuous learning

933
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:38,720
so this is something that we can strive

934
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:40,320
towards and we can do this in security

935
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:41,039
as well

936
00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:42,240
i think it's one of the things that's

937
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:43,760
helped me a lot in my world when i'm

938
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:44,399
dealing with

939
00:27:44,399 --> 00:27:46,799
cloud security issues is i know the

940
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:49,039
fundamentals of my platform so well

941
00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:50,799
and i can kind of reason through why

942
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:52,000
things are working or not working the

943
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:52,720
way they are

944
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:54,240
and as a result i am able to better

945
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,159
assess risk and be able better able to

946
00:27:56,159 --> 00:27:58,399
manage risk

947
00:27:58,399 --> 00:28:02,240
now the last phase is enlightenment

948
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:05,279
no not cosmic enlightenment but

949
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:08,000
at this point we are hopefully

950
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,520
anti-fragile

951
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:12,399
because you can't get through everything

952
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:13,919
that i've just talked about

953
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:17,120
unless you have learned really strong

954
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:18,399
coping skills

955
00:28:18,399 --> 00:28:21,120
because either you become anti-fragile

956
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:22,480
or you burn out

957
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:24,000
and trust me just because you burnt out

958
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,520
doesn't mean you stop working

959
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:27,120
but you're not going to be a positive

960
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:29,120
influence on your coworkers

961
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:32,559
your patients your organization and

962
00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:35,520
we're have kind of a balance as well as

963
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:36,480
a better

964
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,799
perspective because of all those years

965
00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:40,399
of experience and working through these

966
00:28:40,399 --> 00:28:41,440
issues

967
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:44,960
now at this point we have a lot of

968
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:47,279
baggage

969
00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:48,720
i see some pretty horrible things as a

970
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,640
paramedic plenty of dead bodies

971
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:54,080
dead kids maggots smells

972
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:55,760
rotting flesh like i don't want to go

973
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:57,919
into it you don't care domestic violence

974
00:28:57,919 --> 00:28:59,279
is probably the one that really gets me

975
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:00,720
the most or one of the ones that gets me

976
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:01,600
the most

977
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:04,720
it's pretty bad but i'm okay and i'm

978
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:05,520
okay because

979
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:07,840
for me what i've managed to do is

980
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:09,440
compartmentalize

981
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:11,279
and everybody has different techniques

982
00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:13,440
to do this i use context shifting

983
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:16,640
i try and keep work at work and then i

984
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:17,120
have

985
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:21,200
my home life and my non-medical career

986
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:23,600
and my hobbies on the outside and you

987
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:25,200
really got to break those apart

988
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:28,080
if all you do and we we call them

989
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:30,799
sometimes the rescue randy's in the uh

990
00:29:30,799 --> 00:29:32,240
in the emergency services community

991
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:33,760
where they work all day and then they

992
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:35,440
volunteer and they take pages all night

993
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:36,880
for another agency

994
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:38,320
that's not sustainable you have to have

995
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:39,760
the ability to turn it off and go do

996
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:40,000
other

997
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,679
things and compartmentalize that

998
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:42,960
particularly if you're working in busier

999
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:43,440
areas

1000
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:45,919
when you do that in security as well we

1001
00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:47,360
need to shut the laptop and spend time

1002
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:48,320
with our families

1003
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:50,480
those are things that really help us in

1004
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:51,840
the longer term mental health and the

1005
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:52,799
people who really

1006
00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:54,880
are in this for the long haul and who

1007
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:57,039
are basically well balanced

1008
00:29:57,039 --> 00:29:59,919
you can see that and how they work we

1009
00:29:59,919 --> 00:30:00,640
also

1010
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:03,200
start focusing a bit more on outcomes as

1011
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:04,320
opposed to just

1012
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:07,279
inputs and protocols and numbers in

1013
00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:08,159
medicine we call

1014
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:09,919
science-based medicine this is a a

1015
00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:11,840
combination of you know what if a new

1016
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:13,279
study comes out and and

1017
00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:14,480
you know with all the new covid stuff

1018
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:16,320
coming out this is what i look for

1019
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:19,039
is there a plausible scientific basis is

1020
00:30:19,039 --> 00:30:21,039
there evidence to support it the actual

1021
00:30:21,039 --> 00:30:22,799
numbers and

1022
00:30:22,799 --> 00:30:24,799
are there good outcomes because you can

1023
00:30:24,799 --> 00:30:26,640
actually have a plausible scientific

1024
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:27,440
basis

1025
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:29,039
and evidence but then turns out the

1026
00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:30,720
outcomes are really bad

1027
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:32,080
i think we're actually terrible at this

1028
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:34,080
in security we don't do randomized

1029
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:35,279
control trials

1030
00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:37,760
rely on vendor numbers of of uh

1031
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:39,840
vulnerability counts or

1032
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:42,799
surveys or malware variants that have

1033
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:44,399
been detected we don't do a good job of

1034
00:30:44,399 --> 00:30:45,360
correlating

1035
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:47,039
uh we don't have controls we don't have

1036
00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:48,640
p-values randomized controlled trials

1037
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:50,240
and it's hard to do that but it's not

1038
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:51,679
impossible to do that clearly if we can

1039
00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:53,200
do it on human beings and do it

1040
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:54,159
ethically

1041
00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:55,600
we can probably do it in security

1042
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:57,039
without placing our organizations at

1043
00:30:57,039 --> 00:30:58,240
greater risk

1044
00:30:58,240 --> 00:30:59,760
a great example of this came out

1045
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:00,640
recently it's something called the

1046
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:01,919
paramedic ii trial

1047
00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:03,440
where they actually looked at thousands

1048
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:05,039
of patients who got epinephrine

1049
00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:06,960
pre-hospital in the ambulance when they

1050
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:08,559
were in cardiac arrest

1051
00:31:08,559 --> 00:31:11,039
and it turns out we as paramedics are

1052
00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:12,320
very very very good at getting

1053
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:13,519
heartbeats back

1054
00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:14,960
if i catch you in the field probably

1055
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:16,640
within 10 minutes of you going down i

1056
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:18,080
can almost always guarantee you're going

1057
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:19,360
to have some kind of a heartbeat when i

1058
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:20,960
drop you off at the hospital

1059
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:22,080
but are you going to walk out of the

1060
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:23,840
hospital it turns out the answer is no

1061
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:24,480
there's actually

1062
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:27,039
no difference between placebos and

1063
00:31:27,039 --> 00:31:28,640
epinephrine in patients who

1064
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:30,480
survived with an intact neurological

1065
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:32,720
outcome we were getting heartbeats back

1066
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:34,960
and creating very expensive icu patients

1067
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:37,360
without necessarily actually improving

1068
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:39,600
that overall patient's life

1069
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:41,440
and this one study is not going to

1070
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:42,960
change medicine we're still going to

1071
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:44,559
give epinephrine because now

1072
00:31:44,559 --> 00:31:45,840
we need to move forward to the next

1073
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:46,880
level and figure out what are the

1074
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:48,240
different circumstances

1075
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:49,600
what are the different mechanisms of

1076
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:51,440
action why does this work why doesn't

1077
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:52,799
it not work and is there still a role

1078
00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:54,320
for epinephrine and it's going to

1079
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:55,919
probably take us a decade

1080
00:31:55,919 --> 00:31:57,760
to answer those questions but that's the

1081
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:59,120
difference between science or pure

1082
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:00,080
evidence based which

1083
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:01,760
is if you want to know the difference if

1084
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:03,200
you look at those studies for food

1085
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:05,120
supplements that you can go buy at some

1086
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:05,840
of those

1087
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:08,559
you know at some of the nutrition stores

1088
00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:10,080
they have a lot of evidence and studies

1089
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:10,880
but they're like

1090
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:13,120
us letting the vendors tell us if we

1091
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:16,000
need to worry about malware

1092
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:19,440
an example of this is we force

1093
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:21,120
people to reset their passwords every 90

1094
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:22,399
days even if they have multi-factor

1095
00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:23,519
authentication enabled

1096
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:24,960
i just did work for a client i think it

1097
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:27,120
was every oh it was every 90 days

1098
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:29,200
does that improve security well if they

1099
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:30,880
have mfa turned on

1100
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:34,559
probably not and it is adding

1101
00:32:34,559 --> 00:32:36,640
complexity into a situation without

1102
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:40,000
necessarily improving the outcome

1103
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,519
and if we're really good we've moved up

1104
00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:43,519
at this point into management and we've

1105
00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:45,039
looked at these issues and we have a

1106
00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:47,039
better understanding of our profession

1107
00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:49,519
and we're mentally healthy and one of

1108
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:51,279
the things that

1109
00:32:51,279 --> 00:32:53,760
we can really use do to improve is look

1110
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:55,600
at just culture

1111
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:58,640
just culture is about creating

1112
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:01,919
anti-fragile workplaces so with just

1113
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:03,760
culture the idea is it's the opposite of

1114
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:05,039
blame culture

1115
00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:08,080
if we find that there's an error that

1116
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:09,600
somebody made a mistake

1117
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:12,240
do we blame them for that mistake or do

1118
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:14,080
we take the anti-fragile approach

1119
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:16,799
and find out why that mistake was made

1120
00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:18,640
the classic example of medicine

1121
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:21,919
is medication errors paramedic i work at

1122
00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:22,799
three in the morning

1123
00:33:22,799 --> 00:33:25,679
in bad light i'm now 49 years old so i

1124
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:27,919
don't see as well at night as i used to

1125
00:33:27,919 --> 00:33:29,360
some of my medications depending on

1126
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:30,799
where i'm working they come in vials

1127
00:33:30,799 --> 00:33:32,399
that have the same colored tops

1128
00:33:32,399 --> 00:33:34,240
in the same shape vial and the same

1129
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:35,760
fonts on the labels

1130
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:37,200
it's very easy for me to potentially

1131
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:38,960
make a mistake and if i did make a

1132
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:39,519
mistake

1133
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:41,200
in a blame culture environment i'd get

1134
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,399
yelled at for not checking the

1135
00:33:42,399 --> 00:33:43,519
medication for not

1136
00:33:43,519 --> 00:33:45,519
making sure that i was giving the right

1137
00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:46,640
patient the right medication at the

1138
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:47,600
right time

1139
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:50,320
in just culture they're going to find a

1140
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:51,120
different vial

1141
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:52,240
they're going to put a different color

1142
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:53,840
on the top or maybe we'll put a piece of

1143
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:54,640
tape around it

1144
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:56,080
so that we know the difference so that

1145
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:57,840
i'm not making that mistake it's about

1146
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:59,519
improving the system

1147
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:01,519
it's not about necessarily finding

1148
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:03,519
somebody to blame

1149
00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:05,600
again an area we have a lot of room for

1150
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:07,360
improvement in cyber security

1151
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:10,000
if you use the word shadow i.t you don't

1152
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:10,560
have a just

1153
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:12,879
culture you're blaming users for using

1154
00:34:12,879 --> 00:34:14,399
technologies that they think they need

1155
00:34:14,399 --> 00:34:16,399
to get their job done

1156
00:34:16,399 --> 00:34:19,040
why are they going around in some cases

1157
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:20,800
it could still be recklessness it could

1158
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,000
still be negligence

1159
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,599
but in other cases maybe we're just not

1160
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:24,879
giving them the right tools or not

1161
00:34:24,879 --> 00:34:27,839
understanding their needs

1162
00:34:27,839 --> 00:34:32,480
enthusiasm ego empathy and enlightenment

1163
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:34,159
we don't all go through these phases and

1164
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:35,599
we don't all go through them in the same

1165
00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:37,040
timeframe it's just a way of thinking

1166
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:38,159
about it

1167
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:39,918
myself i don't think i'm in

1168
00:34:39,918 --> 00:34:42,159
enlightenment in emergency medicine yet

1169
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:43,839
i think that moving to a part-time

1170
00:34:43,839 --> 00:34:45,359
paramedic has

1171
00:34:45,359 --> 00:34:47,040
inhibited my ability there's things i

1172
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:49,359
still don't have fully internalized that

1173
00:34:49,359 --> 00:34:51,918
i would like to in terms of my practice

1174
00:34:51,918 --> 00:34:55,760
but i think i've nailed the empathy

1175
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:57,920
recently i was up in the navajo nation

1176
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:59,839
helping with the covet response i was

1177
00:34:59,839 --> 00:35:01,200
out there with team rubicon which is an

1178
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:02,800
amazing organization

1179
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:05,119
and we had one patient that came in

1180
00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:07,200
every night alcoholic

1181
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:08,560
the police were dropping him off because

1182
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:09,680
they were just finding him on the street

1183
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:10,800
wanting to get him out of the way

1184
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:12,240
or he'd wander in because he wanted a

1185
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:14,000
place to sleep this guy's brain was

1186
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:14,880
fried

1187
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:18,320
but he was a nice person and

1188
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:21,119
we i would not have treated him as a

1189
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:22,720
human being earlier in my career

1190
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:24,079
i didn't have the right role models for

1191
00:35:24,079 --> 00:35:25,359
it i didn't even think about it it was

1192
00:35:25,359 --> 00:35:27,440
just another drunk getting in my way

1193
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:29,359
but i tried my best to treat him with

1194
00:35:29,359 --> 00:35:30,640
empathy and compassion

1195
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:32,400
and so did the rest of that emergency

1196
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:33,520
department to the point where people

1197
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:34,400
brought in clothes

1198
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:37,760
and then one night myself at and the emt

1199
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,040
that i was working with

1200
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:41,040
we actually stripped them down and we

1201
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:42,320
cleaned them off with wipes

1202
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:44,800
this is not in any paramedic or nurses

1203
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:45,599
protocols

1204
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:47,119
unless somebody's in the hospital for

1205
00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:49,359
days or weeks we cleaned the guy down

1206
00:35:49,359 --> 00:35:50,800
i even trimmed his fungus ridden

1207
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:53,599
toenails because the thing is is

1208
00:35:53,599 --> 00:35:54,880
we weren't going to make him not an

1209
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:57,280
alcoholic we were

1210
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:58,880
not going to be able to change his

1211
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:00,960
long-term life decisions

1212
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:02,640
i was not going to justify any of those

1213
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:04,480
decisions but

1214
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:06,480
he was a human being who was having a

1215
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:08,480
really bad time

1216
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:10,560
and the best part of that was i got to

1217
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:12,800
do it with this emt

1218
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:16,400
and maybe hopefully i was serving a bit

1219
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:17,440
as mentor

1220
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:19,440
because if you make it this far into

1221
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:20,880
your career

1222
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:22,720
i think we have an obligation to be that

1223
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:24,400
positive role model

1224
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:27,040
to help others throughout their careers

1225
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:28,560
mentoring is one of the best ways to do

1226
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:30,640
that

1227
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:31,920
thank you for your time that's all i

1228
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:33,520
have but i do want to close on one last

1229
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:35,119
note

1230
00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:38,320
we are in the midst of for me what i was

1231
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:39,119
trained in

1232
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:42,560
as the worst possible case scenario and

1233
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:44,079
things are pretty bad out there so i'm

1234
00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:45,599
just going to ask

1235
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:48,079
pay attention think of others and please

1236
00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:48,880
wear your mask

1237
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:50,560
protect yourself protect your families

1238
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:51,839
and protect those of us who have to come

1239
00:36:51,839 --> 00:36:53,359
out and help you

1240
00:36:53,359 --> 00:36:55,839
thank you

1241
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:00,960
hey everyone so thanks for watching the

1242
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:03,760
session this was uh

1243
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:05,520
um it was a big one it was an emotional

1244
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:07,040
one for me to do this after

1245
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:10,240
a few years so i'm gonna blab away until

1246
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:11,839
we have any chat questions

1247
00:37:11,839 --> 00:37:14,000
uh for me i think for infosec

1248
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,280
professionals

1249
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:16,720
i try to cover a bit about like the

1250
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:17,839
lessons i learned about incident

1251
00:37:17,839 --> 00:37:19,040
response and

1252
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:20,720
and kind of some of those skills i think

1253
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:22,000
those have absolutely helped me in

1254
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:22,960
security

1255
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:24,560
but i think particularly for those who

1256
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:26,000
are high level managers the

1257
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,720
just culture concepts uh that that come

1258
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:29,520
in at the end

1259
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:33,520
is probably where we need to focus um

1260
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:34,720
you know i think that that's where we

1261
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:36,560
can really start to make

1262
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:39,599
systemic differences uh into

1263
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:41,839
our environments and and actually you

1264
00:37:41,839 --> 00:37:43,599
know again if you're in a managerial

1265
00:37:43,599 --> 00:37:45,040
position like i get to be

1266
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:47,119
uh these days that you're actually able

1267
00:37:47,119 --> 00:37:49,359
to go through and and make changes and

1268
00:37:49,359 --> 00:37:51,440
induce that kind of a positive

1269
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:52,480
environment

1270
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:56,160
uh you know they

1271
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:58,720
all the other bits i mean um the mental

1272
00:37:58,720 --> 00:37:59,760
health the burnout

1273
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:01,680
i think also with covet and what's going

1274
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:03,200
on are

1275
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:06,160
definitely it's definitely hitting all

1276
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:07,760
of us i mean the the repetition of being

1277
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:08,800
home all the time

1278
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:10,640
is you know this is some of the same

1279
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:12,079
things that we see when you're running

1280
00:38:12,079 --> 00:38:13,760
on calls and everything else

1281
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:15,280
um by the way i appreciate all the

1282
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:16,800
comments in here um

1283
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,160
you know ask questions we got a couple

1284
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:19,839
of minutes left if you have

1285
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:21,200
anything else that you want to hear

1286
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:23,040
about uh you know kind of

1287
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:24,400
uh what went into putting this one

1288
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:26,160
together and everything else but i had a

1289
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:26,960
blast i mean i was

1290
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:28,480
i spent like two three years planning

1291
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:30,640
this um i think like you're saying who's

1292
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:32,480
watching this and a few other people

1293
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:35,119
uh you know many uh conversations

1294
00:38:35,119 --> 00:38:36,960
usually at black hat and defcon and

1295
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:37,920
frequently

1296
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:40,000
uh let's just say well alcohol abuse is

1297
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,200
bad a little bit at

1298
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:43,440
your conferences and stuff uh isn't

1299
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:44,480
always bad if uh

1300
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:46,240
if you're okay with them you know kind

1301
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:47,760
of over those late night drinks talking

1302
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:49,359
about a bunch of these concepts and

1303
00:38:49,359 --> 00:38:50,880
and trying to put it into that framework

1304
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:52,640
of those four phases those were all like

1305
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:54,400
things i really tried to do

1306
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:57,040
to kind of bring it in and i i honestly

1307
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:58,400
until i started seeing the feedback you

1308
00:38:58,400 --> 00:38:59,520
guys are standing here i didn't know if

1309
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:01,119
anyone care about this stuff

1310
00:39:01,119 --> 00:39:02,560
uh you know it's not the same i'm used

1311
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:05,119
to giving technical talks and

1312
00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:08,480
you know and defensive technical talks

1313
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:11,440
so i think am i out of time guys um i

1314
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:13,119
did put the link in the chat room if you

1315
00:39:13,119 --> 00:39:14,079
want to go ahead and

1316
00:39:14,079 --> 00:39:15,599
carry on a conversation but otherwise

1317
00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:17,200
enjoy the rest of black hat and

1318
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:19,040
maybe we'll get the chance to meet each

1319
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:21,680
other they meet up again next year

1320
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:23,200
hopefully we'll be having this stuff

1321
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:25,440
dealt with by next year

1322
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:28,480
with the crispy role models yeah if you

1323
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:30,079
identify you're the crispy role model

1324
00:39:30,079 --> 00:39:31,200
it's time to get mental health

1325
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:35,200
actually uh that's a um

1326
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:37,119
you have to take a step back separate

1327
00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:39,119
yourself and i had that i got in trouble

1328
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:39,520
at

1329
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:41,280
the stuff at securosa's my partners had

1330
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:42,960
to talk to me because i was going down a

1331
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:44,720
bad path unfortunately they did and i

1332
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:46,880
instead of fighting back i recognized it

1333
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:48,800
and i recognized my own issues

1334
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:50,480
uh took some time and was able to come

1335
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:52,800
back uh

1336
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:56,079
so with uh

1337
00:39:56,079 --> 00:39:57,920
i got 10 seconds left so i'm gonna have

1338
00:39:57,920 --> 00:39:59,359
to answer the other questions over in

1339
00:39:59,359 --> 00:40:00,000
