00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:18,320
hello everyone

3
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:21,359
my name is tamagna basu and

4
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:24,800
i'm here to talk about how i use ai to

5
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:25,599
clone myself

6
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:30,240
in the digital chat so let's get started

7
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:32,960
so brief about me i am the cto and

8
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:34,640
co-founder for neoid

9
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:36,719
uh i have like tickets of experience in

10
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:38,079
this industry

11
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:42,719
uh currently i work on neoid as the cto

12
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:45,520
and apart from that obviously i kind of

13
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,120
advise couple of startups

14
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:48,640
and i'm a mentor for stanford cyber

15
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,320
security course as well

16
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:53,039
in terms of domain i do work in cyber

17
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:54,960
security machine learning and you know

18
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,399
i've been working

19
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:58,480
in various domain like finance insurance

20
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:01,359
uh gaming ecommerce etc etc

21
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:04,080
and uh i'm a frequent speaker on

22
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:05,360
multiple conferences

23
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:08,159
i've done it in past and uh primarily i

24
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:09,280
did it because of

25
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,880
obviously as part of my community

26
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:12,320
activities

27
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:14,880
so that you know we learn from community

28
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,479
and we also try to give back

29
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:20,799
to the community right so moving on

30
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:24,159
as part of our current company what i do

31
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:25,520
is

32
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:27,520
we actually work on a science called

33
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:29,439
behavioral science

34
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:32,640
or behavioral analytics as few of

35
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,960
you might be aware of that subject but

36
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:35,920
what i do is

37
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:39,680
we actually try to profile a person

38
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:42,720
based on the behavior they do they

39
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,159
acquire over the time the habits they

40
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:46,320
acquire on devices for example

41
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,960
how you type how you hold the phone how

42
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,159
you walk

43
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:52,000
all these are unique for each individual

44
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,280
so together we

45
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,280
capture all these kind of parameters and

46
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,119
try to build a profile of a person a

47
00:01:57,119 --> 00:01:58,799
behavioral persona

48
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:01,520
and uh and use it for protecting your

49
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,439
identity so that if someone tries to

50
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:04,640
impersonate you

51
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,560
we can identify based on the behavior

52
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,000
saying that is that you

53
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,520
or is somebody else who is trying to

54
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,440
impersonate you

55
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,920
right and why this is important because

56
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:14,959
that's what uh

57
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:18,000
also sets the background of this uh this

58
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,959
this talk so today's agenda is this we

59
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:22,400
will be talking about uh

60
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,560
obviously the background the demo the

61
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:25,760
architecture

62
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,280
and as i mentioned then i will be

63
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,920
releasing the code so i will be showing

64
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:30,640
on the code

65
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:33,680
code base and and obviously

66
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,840
the next steps what are the next thing

67
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:36,959
can be done

68
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:39,120
and and see if any of you would be

69
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,080
interested to

70
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,599
contribute to this or not i'll be more

71
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:43,040
than happy to collaborate and i know

72
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:45,200
secure support of this

73
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:49,200
right uh moving on so the inspiration

74
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:52,400
uh was uh two part

75
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,959
one was as i was mentioning uh while

76
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:56,640
working in new york

77
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,080
where we're trying to do behavioral

78
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,159
analysis so

79
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:03,040
one side we were trying to use behaviors

80
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,959
to protect your identity to prevent

81
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:06,159
identity fraud

82
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:09,120
so our objective was can i use ai to

83
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,239
identify

84
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:12,159
if there is any fraud impersonation

85
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:13,280
happening or not

86
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,200
now while doing it we got this other

87
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,400
idea also

88
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,959
more from an adversarial aspect uh

89
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:19,920
saying that

90
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:23,040
okay uh what if we use it to

91
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,120
replicate an identity what if we can use

92
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,040
it to clone someone right

93
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,840
so that is the kind of idea we had and

94
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:30,480
uh

95
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,640
and you know obviously the uh it got

96
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,720
kicked by this episode of blackmail uh

97
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:35,760
which was actually

98
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,239
season two uh first episode called be

99
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:39,440
right back

100
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:42,159
where uh the story goes like uh this

101
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:43,519
lady martha

102
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:48,480
she uh she lost her boyfriend ash

103
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:51,680
on a car accident and

104
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,560
she was very upset and obviously she was

105
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,920
trying to get back to life but

106
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:59,200
couldn't cope up with the depression now

107
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,959
there was a futuristic company which

108
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:02,560
kind of you know approached

109
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,720
to her saying that i could bring we

110
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,319
could bring back ash

111
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:09,599
to you uh via chats via

112
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:12,640
you know via social media via

113
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,799
video and audio and stuff like that so

114
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:16,959
she registered and the first interface

115
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:18,880
became a chat interface where

116
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:21,358
she could chat with ash over let's say

117
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:23,199
some sort of messenger

118
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:26,240
and moving from there it became a phone

119
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,560
call where they upgrade to a next plan

120
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,840
where you know we can actually have a

121
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:30,400
disc

122
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,720
a phone call with ash uh with ash's

123
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,320
voice and then obviously finally there

124
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:34,960
was

125
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:37,520
a 3d kind of a model that's actually a

126
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,040
person comes

127
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,040
so so that's how the story goes so

128
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,400
definitely this actually

129
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:45,680
uh kind of you know hit me and i thought

130
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,360
okay why don't you start like the same

131
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:47,840
way

132
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:50,080
and see if it's possible or not so i

133
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,680
started like a small experiment

134
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,280
that's uh that's how it started so here

135
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,360
is a quick chat about i created

136
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,759
and i just want to show some of the

137
00:04:57,759 --> 00:04:58,880
sample chats

138
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,800
uh which a conversation happened between

139
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,320
a human and the bot

140
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:05,199
so here it goes this is the first one so

141
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:07,120
so here the left side

142
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,840
of the of the screen was bought and the

143
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:11,600
right side was a human and this human is

144
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,600
a co-founder of mine lsu

145
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,800
so this is a discussion how it unfolds

146
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:20,080
uh so unless you ask something start and

147
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,759
then you say start what

148
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:24,800
then the bot says uh lsu's is bought

149
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:28,000
uh this is what is a guy and uh nice to

150
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,840
meet you bot nice to meet you too

151
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:32,960
so what can i do be a better bot so i'm

152
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:36,000
not about this guy become like you know

153
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,680
say i'm a wrong person so

154
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:40,000
so you can see the it is able to handle

155
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,680
some sort of chit chats

156
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:45,039
a bit a little bit of sarcasm as well

157
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:48,639
and uh then the human says really

158
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:52,240
then it and emphasizes yes

159
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:55,840
i am raw pencil right so uh so nice to

160
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:56,479
meet you

161
00:05:56,479 --> 00:05:59,600
and says yes uh nice to meet you

162
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,520
and uh then comes you seems like an

163
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,520
intelligent guy i says i'm glad you

164
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:04,080
noticed

165
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,720
so where are you i'm at kevin no where

166
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:07,199
are you

167
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:11,120
i'm outside so uh so it looks like a

168
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:14,319
very general conversation uh now what

169
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:16,639
lsu tries to do it try to

170
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:18,560
get into little more knowledge aspects

171
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,000
of the bot so

172
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,360
what he asked that you know are you an

173
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,120
intelligent guy can you tell me about

174
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,560
something are you a cyber security

175
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,600
person

176
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,600
uh bob says no the necessary quantum

177
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,759
physics the bot says yes

178
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:33,680
i'm a quantum physicist then he asked

179
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:37,759
okay can you explain particle anytime uh

180
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:39,919
what says i have no idea what that means

181
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:41,039
so

182
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:43,520
so yeah uh and then since you are not a

183
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:44,880
quantum physicist

184
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,479
so you're about there yes i've been told

185
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:48,080
so right so

186
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,800
uh this this there is a funny aspect

187
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,720
there is a sarcasm there is a normal

188
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,960
kind of chat chat is happening

189
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:57,360
now uh there are further conversations

190
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,120
happened on the similar line with other

191
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,080
people

192
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,319
this is another person uh a discussion

193
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:04,720
happened between bot and another person

194
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:08,080
and uh this guy asked how old are you

195
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:10,319
what says some sort of you know funny

196
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:12,319
joke is just a number

197
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:15,120
uh you're so as also this is but how old

198
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:15,680
are you

199
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:18,160
what do you think how old i am that's 18

200
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,919
and then it cracks a joke it says you

201
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:21,120
know what sounds like you know i can

202
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,440
crack a joke for you

203
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,840
now this is another person and this guy

204
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:26,960
tries to become little more

205
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,000
philosophical

206
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,840
so he says okay fine is that a

207
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,039
philosophical question

208
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:33,599
so this is an interesting question you

209
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:35,039
know do the

210
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:37,120
and there's some random discussion so

211
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,720
that's again

212
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:41,680
uh a behavioral trait which i have let's

213
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:42,080
say

214
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,240
when i talk to my friends randomly you

215
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,240
know switch the topic

216
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,639
show some sort of sarcasm you know be

217
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:50,240
funny at times

218
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,919
so definitely it looks like you know

219
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:53,440
those kind of flavor

220
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:57,199
of behaviors is able to replicate here

221
00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:00,639
right and uh and here is a small social

222
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:01,840
proof of that

223
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:05,039
uh the idea was uh when i built this

224
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:07,599
as sort of a beta testing i tried with a

225
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:09,039
close group of friends

226
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:10,400
and when i said friends they are all

227
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,479
working professionals

228
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:14,800
entrepreneurs as well as cyber security

229
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,160
experts who are you know

230
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,240
friends in my network i've just given

231
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,000
them this

232
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,800
bot over whatsapp or telegram and ask

233
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,240
them to chat with it

234
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:27,120
and and in our common friends group this

235
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,960
is free of the friend has responded back

236
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,000
saying that you know

237
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,799
it feels like uh it looks like you know

238
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:33,839
it's

239
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:35,919
it's not a part but they thought uh it's

240
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:38,000
me actually is chatting uh

241
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,360
with with them right so so although uh

242
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,640
i'm not saying that i have passed the

243
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,880
turing test but uh but definitely this

244
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,399
gives me a to some extent a bit of

245
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:47,519
satisfactory

246
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:50,399
uh result of feelings saying that okay

247
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:51,680
fine you know what it looks like you

248
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:52,320
know it's

249
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:55,760
it's try i'm trying to achieve a part of

250
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:58,880
the objective which i have all right now

251
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:01,040
now here is a small video demonstration

252
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,480
taking it to the furthest so let me show

253
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,240
you the further now what kind of final

254
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,760
outcome we're looking at

255
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,680
and this is actually a bot which is

256
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,360
actually talking over video

257
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:14,399
hey how's it going good how are you

258
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:18,080
i'm doing very well thanks how are you

259
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:21,200
good okay hey

260
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:26,160
need some help if you don't mind tell me

261
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,240
well it's a bit awkward to ask you this

262
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,160
really sorry

263
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:32,880
right so uh we will see this demo

264
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:33,600
further

265
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,120
more details but you can see that you

266
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,880
know it's quite quite achievable

267
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:39,440
and uh it's it's something you know i'm

268
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,320
able to

269
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:43,839
uh able to do uh uh with with

270
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:46,560
with the video and audio um so that's

271
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,560
that's that's the ultimate goal i had so

272
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:48,959
my

273
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:53,120
ultimate objective was can i build a

274
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:56,640
an avatar of mine let's say which can

275
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:59,839
be used uh to actually

276
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:03,600
have a conversation uh over text

277
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,640
voice and video uh as a channel right so

278
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,240
so that's what i know we're trying to do

279
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,320
so so let's deep dive into the

280
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,440
architecture and see

281
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:15,120
how how how this this has been built

282
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,920
right so so at the entire project i have

283
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:20,160
kind of you know split it in three parts

284
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,480
uh i call it the brain the voice and the

285
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:23,360
face

286
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:26,560
all right uh the brain is the engine

287
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:29,760
uh the the nlp engine

288
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:33,040
which is the crux of this entire entire

289
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,240
project where

290
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:37,600
it knows uh a sort of you know what kind

291
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,279
of discussion what kind of questions

292
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:41,519
uh and what kind of answers i should

293
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:44,240
give how we should generate answers

294
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,839
in what context i should generate

295
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:47,760
answers and when i'm generating when i'm

296
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,200
responding to somebody or you know

297
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,560
creating an answer

298
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:53,040
it should resemble uh some sort of some

299
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:55,120
part of my behavioral threats

300
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:57,600
right so this is this is something this

301
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:58,720
is the crux of the

302
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:01,040
entire

303
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:05,279
and the next part is the voice and the

304
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:07,680
face right so the voice comes which is

305
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:08,079
uh

306
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:10,560
about the voice cloning uh where i can

307
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,160
try to then

308
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:14,000
clone my voice and see that we can talk

309
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,360
like uh in an

310
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,360
audio which is sounds like me and

311
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,560
finally the face

312
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,800
where you know can it be in my face you

313
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:21,760
know my uh

314
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:24,959
appearance right now uh just to

315
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:28,399
mention here uh we guys already know

316
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:28,880
about

317
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:31,600
you know defects right you know the uh

318
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:32,399
defect

319
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:35,200
on voice defect on face and audio so

320
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,399
there's a lot of videos like that has

321
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:37,440
been there

322
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,920
so as i said i'm not here to make

323
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:40,880
another

324
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,880
solution which is better than what is

325
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:44,880
there in the industry so i'm pretty sure

326
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,160
defects or you know

327
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:48,320
voice cloning the the neural network

328
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,079
whatever is there is fine

329
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:52,399
which is much better and you know work

330
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:54,240
perfectly fine

331
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,480
the point here i'm trying to make is is

332
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:57,440
can i make it

333
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,600
interactive can i make it more lively

334
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,360
now in the chatbot domain

335
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:03,600
uh this can this kind of concept is

336
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:06,000
called open domain chatbot

337
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,519
now this is one of the most difficult

338
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:09,600
area of research where can i build a

339
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,040
chatbot where you know

340
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:13,040
based on with an nlp and neural network

341
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:16,160
where i can have a free flow discussion

342
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:19,200
right so that's what is the

343
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,880
part which eighty percent of the time

344
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,240
i've spent

345
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:25,360
during this research right so let's dive

346
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:25,920
into this

347
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:28,320
uh this part and see what exactly i have

348
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,519
done right

349
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:31,519
so the brain when i talk about the brain

350
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:32,959
right it is it is

351
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:35,680
the it is an engine which learns from

352
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:36,000
the

353
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,399
my past behavior known as the past

354
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:39,519
behavior

355
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:41,440
it's just my past conversation so what i

356
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,200
did is in terms of in a nutshell is

357
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,120
basically i have kind of

358
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,680
extracted out all my possible lesser

359
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:48,160
chat

360
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:50,480
histories which i have used you know i

361
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,839
have kind of you know spoken to

362
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:52,560
different

363
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:55,839
people in facebook whatsapp linkedin

364
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:58,800
uh over email and i've kind of collected

365
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,079
all this data

366
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:02,720
i have processed this data created in a

367
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,240
meaningful manner saying okay you know

368
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:04,880
what this is

369
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,480
this is the kind of the sample data

370
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:07,920
which you should be trained

371
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:10,000
and with this data you should understand

372
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,240
that my way of saying things

373
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:15,360
right is so that you know somebody

374
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,920
who has already spoken to me in past and

375
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:18,560
the person

376
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,639
again tries to talk to me the person

377
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:22,320
should get the similar feeling right in

378
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,079
terms of you know discussion

379
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:25,839
now then i fade into various kind of

380
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:27,839
model and this part was the tricky part

381
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:28,720
because uh

382
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:32,240
honestly speaking there was not much uh

383
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,160
a good model i was getting so basically

384
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:35,519
i tried multiple model

385
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:38,320
uh sequential model neural machine empty

386
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,199
model

387
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:41,760
uh and then rule and intent based model

388
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:42,880
uh these are model

389
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,560
various kind of you know ways of you

390
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,160
know generating text

391
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:48,639
right in nlp family with nlp these are

392
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:50,480
these are various ways you do it but

393
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:53,040
overall the uh the idea was actually we

394
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,639
use a sequential model

395
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:56,639
uh we try to feed in some context to

396
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:57,920
that and

397
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,560
and then generate an output now the

398
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:02,160
output as i said uh

399
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:05,279
wasn't uh always good so what i tried to

400
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:06,399
do is basically

401
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:08,959
i created multiple model feed in the

402
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:09,680
data

403
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:11,839
uh whenever there's an input comes it

404
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:13,760
generates an output which is a response

405
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:15,920
and then looking at the confidence score

406
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,680
find out what is the best

407
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:20,000
possible answer which i could get and

408
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
then give that back to the

409
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,920
step so that's this is a very basic uh

410
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:28,320
explanation of how it works so this is

411
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,760
the training part once this training is

412
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:30,079
done

413
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:33,360
we generate the model and

414
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,920
we do it now the problem with this is

415
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:37,680
all this model

416
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:40,959
are good in terms of it is able to

417
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:43,680
get the let's say the utterances the the

418
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,839
words kind of words are used and stuff

419
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:46,800
like that

420
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:49,920
however most of the time it

421
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:52,320
is not able to generate a sentence which

422
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,839
makes sense

423
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:57,040
so it generate a collection of words

424
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:59,519
but those words together doesn't form

425
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:00,800
meaningful standard

426
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,560
sentence in that context that was one of

427
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,480
the challenge i had

428
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:06,880
and that then made me you know take a

429
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:09,040
different route for this approach

430
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:11,279
right and and this is where you know

431
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:12,480
that the next

432
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,800
kind of category of approach which i'll

433
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,240
be spending time on

434
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:19,040
so what i try to do first is i try to

435
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:21,120
look into this data and categorize them

436
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,240
into multiple

437
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:25,360
uh branches saying that okay when i'm

438
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,120
having some conversation what

439
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:29,839
kind of conversation mostly i had or i'm

440
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:31,360
kind of you know i can i can feed this

441
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:33,120
into in different buckets

442
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:35,279
so there are four categories uh possibly

443
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:37,360
i could identify one is chit chat

444
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:39,360
chit chat is nothing but simply hi hello

445
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:40,480
how are you

446
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:43,120
those kind of discussion second is

447
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:46,000
historical data historical data means

448
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,120
this is something i have spoken or i

449
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,320
have told

450
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:52,800
or i i kind of had this conversation on

451
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,000
this context

452
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
and the same kind of question was asked

453
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,199
to me again

454
00:15:57,199 --> 00:16:00,480
right so uh so maybe you know something

455
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,880
uh which somebody you know can i come to

456
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:03,920
your house today

457
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:06,160
and you know or shall we meet tomorrow

458
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:07,040
right so

459
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:08,560
something like that which is which is

460
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:10,000
already been discussed or probably you

461
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,759
know in on a specific context right okay

462
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:13,360
fine i am going to this hackathon

463
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:16,160
are you coming to me uh coming to uh

464
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:17,279
join me

465
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:20,000
something like that now comes uh that's

466
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,680
called category two now the category

467
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:22,079
three

468
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:25,360
was a topical factual something like

469
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,720
basically how is the weather today or

470
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,399
what is sequel injection or probably it

471
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:29,279
could be let's say

472
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:31,199
okay how long it will take for you to

473
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:32,720
come from uh

474
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:35,839
bangalore something like that right so

475
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:37,680
there is some part of knowledge is

476
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:38,639
required for that

477
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:41,920
that is category three and uh category

478
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:43,120
fourth was

479
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:46,240
pure generative uh philosophical

480
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:48,800
anything which is not the category one

481
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,000
two or three which is basically is a

482
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,199
free flow chart right

483
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:52,720
it could be you know what is the purpose

484
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,720
of life you know what is love

485
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:57,120
you know defined life something like

486
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,399
that something

487
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:00,959
generic so these are overall the four

488
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:02,160
category and what i

489
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,640
i tried to do is i realized that you

490
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:05,679
know when i

491
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:07,839
i try to create do a different treatment

492
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:09,520
for this different category

493
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:11,919
and uh that's how we can actually you

494
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:12,959
know i try to

495
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:15,439
get a better response or better result

496
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:16,480
of this

497
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:19,839
this engine right now how do i handle it

498
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:22,640
this is how i handled it so rasa is an

499
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:23,839
open source

500
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:26,160
chat chatbot framework using which you

501
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,679
can actually create a chatbot this is

502
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:29,280
mostly used for

503
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:31,919
let's say not open domain but a closed

504
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:33,600
domain chatbot where actually you have

505
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,360
some specifically say a hotel booking

506
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:36,080
board

507
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:37,840
or some business toilet and what people

508
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:40,880
ask it now how it works it has basically

509
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:43,360
there are four three four properties

510
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:45,360
first is called intent

511
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:48,320
this is nothing but okay uh what the

512
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:49,440
user is

513
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,520
want to know or want to do what is the

514
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:52,640
intent of the user

515
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:55,360
so for example if user is saying hey hi

516
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:56,160
how are you

517
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:58,799
good morning what's up intent wants to

518
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:00,400
greet me all right

519
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:03,919
if a user says goodbye good night uh

520
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:06,640
see uh then which means intent means

521
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,000
user wants to

522
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,720
uh say goodbye right so this is called

523
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:11,840
intent

524
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:14,640
now then you define okay if this is the

525
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:15,200
intent

526
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:18,400
what is the response i would i should

527
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,400
i should i should say right if someone

528
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,240
says bye i should say bye

529
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:25,120
if someone says great i should say hello

530
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:26,000
or how are you

531
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,240
or hi just like that right so this is

532
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,240
the responsibility of five

533
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,480
and then you club to stitch them

534
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:34,559
together so this is where you actually

535
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:36,640
this is called stories this is called

536
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:38,480
intent this is called utterances and

537
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:39,679
this is called stories

538
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:41,679
and this story is nothing but you say

539
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:43,600
this is where you say okay this is the

540
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,600
if there is a grid you should do a

541
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,039
respond to it at all to it

542
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:49,600
if there is a tank uh you will play with

543
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:50,640
a turnover is

544
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,640
like that right so that's how you club

545
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,640
it together and say okay if users is buy

546
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:57,120
what says by user says thanks bot says

547
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:58,799
no worries like that

548
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:01,280
so this is where the category one the

549
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:03,120
chit chat can be handled because when i

550
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:05,280
say chit chat hi hello how are you

551
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:07,520
the the majorly the the response will

552
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:08,960
not change right it will be the similar

553
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,320
kind of response

554
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:14,240
so i used rasa for the category one uh

555
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:17,600
kind of records

556
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,120
now comes the category two which is

557
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:21,120
historical data

558
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:22,720
so this is where a lot of data

559
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:24,320
processing uh

560
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:27,440
comes so what i've did is we

561
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:30,320
we as i said no we used multiple data

562
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:31,039
sources like

563
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:34,080
my whatsapp chat history facebook chat

564
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:36,480
history

565
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:39,280
linkedin you know discussions or over

566
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:40,400
messages

567
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,640
and we kind of pass all this thing

568
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:43,679
together and uh

569
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:46,640
and i know i created this this format

570
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,320
say okay this is the message and this is

571
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:49,280
the response

572
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:51,440
which essentially means that okay this

573
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,360
is what i was asked to me

574
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:56,720
in past by somebody and this was the

575
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,559
response i have given

576
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:02,559
in return so so for example someone says

577
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:04,159
thanks boss then i said okay

578
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:05,840
why thanks this is a little bit of hindi

579
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:07,760
but thanks sorry for not getting much

580
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:08,320
involved

581
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:11,600
stuff like that right so yes can we meet

582
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:14,080
let everything say sure come over

583
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:17,360
this is hindi right so so this is what

584
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:19,360
uh the format of the structure i added

585
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:21,039
the structure and created

586
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:23,760
now what i use this for now there is

587
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:25,440
another open source chatbot

588
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:28,240
framework called chatterbot i use this

589
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:28,799
for

590
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:30,880
handling this because what it does is

591
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:31,919
this is where

592
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:34,960
you can actually give a collection of

593
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:35,840
user

594
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:39,120
uh a free flow question answer and get

595
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:39,360
it

596
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:43,039
right and what happens is so that next

597
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:44,240
time

598
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:46,960
if someone ask any of this the first one

599
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:48,720
then the respond will be second one

600
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,559
if someone says third one the response

601
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:52,000
will be the fourth one

602
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,440
so like that excuse me uh chatterbot uh

603
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:58,480
works uh so this this is where i handled

604
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:01,919
historical uh data and the conversations

605
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:04,640
right we use chatterboard for that

606
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:07,280
now third is the if you remember third

607
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:08,960
one was the topical they're asking the

608
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,400
questions right you know how far

609
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,080
bangalore is from delhi

610
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:13,760
or how far less anywhere is from

611
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:15,520
california but what is the time right

612
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:16,640
now in

613
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:20,320
in san jose uh something like that

614
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:23,600
so uh for that uh we again use

615
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,679
rasa but rasa has a different component

616
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:27,200
called custom actions

617
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,559
what is that means this is where you

618
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:30,799
define a structure in terms of

619
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:33,120
you can call a third party api right you

620
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:34,880
can call a third party

621
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:38,159
service to gather data and using the

622
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:39,440
data you can actually

623
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:42,880
uh identify uh the response and do it so

624
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:44,480
for example this is one

625
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:48,799
uh kind of action create i created which

626
00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:50,799
is which goes in wikipedia and get to

627
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:52,480
get the result out of wikipedia

628
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:54,240
so if you ask something which is let's

629
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:56,320
say what is uh

630
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:57,840
i don't know maybe same thing what is

631
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:59,679
particle

632
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:01,280
quantum physics or particle entangle

633
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:03,360
entanglement uh it will probably go to

634
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:05,039
wiki and it will get the response and it

635
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:06,480
will send it back to me

636
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:09,200
right so this is called custom actions

637
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,799
uh that's what i used

638
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:12,880
now comes the fourth floor fourth

639
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,480
category which is free flow

640
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:16,240
now free flow is very interesting as i

641
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:17,600
say uh

642
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,120
this is where you know it is it can be

643
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:20,640
any discussions

644
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:24,320
now uh for that uh already there are

645
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:26,960
two interesting you know model i found

646
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:27,840
one is paul

647
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:30,960
ai parlia is created by facebook

648
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,640
uh it's an open source free flow open

649
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:34,159
domain chatbot

650
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:36,720
and these are some examples given so if

651
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:38,559
you go to the website

652
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:40,480
you can actually see that you know this

653
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:41,760
this this actually

654
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:44,640
talks uh in engineering so there is not

655
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:45,440
much

656
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:48,320
uh other thing but when basically i say

657
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,840
can you have a dinner and so it's a

658
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:50,720
tough one okay

659
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,799
interesting choice so what question do

660
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:54,159
you ask him okay i would like to know

661
00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:55,600
how he came up with the idea

662
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,919
for the ipod okay to diaper change the

663
00:22:57,919 --> 00:22:59,440
way everyone listens to me so you can

664
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:01,280
actually have a discussion

665
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:03,840
uh like that why did the mushroom go to

666
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,760
the party i'm not sure but i'm glad

667
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:08,480
it did uh like that no it was supposed

668
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:09,840
to be a joke

669
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:11,200
sorry i didn't get it what kind of joke

670
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,880
it was i like jokes

671
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:15,919
so so this is how uh it was so basically

672
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:17,919
the blue ones are the

673
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:20,840
bot and the the gray one is the human

674
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:22,240
right so

675
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:24,000
you can have a normal conversation here

676
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,159
so that is what you do

677
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:29,760
however there is another model i found

678
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:30,559
which is

679
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:33,200
called dialog gpt which is uh created by

680
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,559
microsoft

681
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:37,679
and uh this guy also does the same thing

682
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:40,000
and you can have so this is some samples

683
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,440
where you know you can actually

684
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:43,679
see how it works users does my money buy

685
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:44,559
happiness

686
00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:46,000
what says depends how much money you

687
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,679
spend on it right

688
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:48,960
this is what is the best way to buy

689
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,880
happiness so you just have to be a

690
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:51,760
millionaire

691
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:54,240
by your early 20s and then being happy

692
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:56,320
so you can see that you know there is a

693
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:57,679
to some extent an intellectual

694
00:23:57,679 --> 00:23:59,679
conversation you can have

695
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:02,880
and and this is this is the two model we

696
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:03,440
found

697
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:06,159
now gpt has multiple version gpu and

698
00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:07,120
gpt2

699
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:11,279
and most recently now openai is kind of

700
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:13,360
about to release i think with gpd3 also

701
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:15,120
and that's this much more bigger and

702
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,440
better so gpt is a model which

703
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:19,440
allows you to generate text and what

704
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:20,880
they are saying now the gp23 can

705
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,880
generate any kind of articles

706
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:25,919
uh statements uh uh poetry and stuff

707
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:26,799
like that so

708
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:29,600
so it's very interesting uh things are

709
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:31,440
happening there

710
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:33,120
now for free flow i had these two

711
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:35,039
choices and out of these two two choices

712
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:36,880
i personally favored uh

713
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:40,159
microsoft dialog gpd because power line

714
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:41,120
was good

715
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:43,840
uh it has more but it sounds more formal

716
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:45,200
however like when i'm talking to my

717
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:47,200
friends this i don't want to be

718
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,880
very formal right i want to be more like

719
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:50,320
in whatsapp dude kind of

720
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:52,880
a conversation right so dialogue gbt has

721
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:54,880
that kind of you know

722
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,080
intimacy in terms of you know

723
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:58,240
conversation so overall

724
00:24:58,240 --> 00:24:59,679
i kind of created this as an

725
00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:02,480
architecture so the way it works is

726
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:06,159
uh we first is the interface so i have

727
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:08,400
exposed it over to whatsapp and telegram

728
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,320
whatsapp white will you one telegram

729
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:12,720
flash because python class server could

730
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:13,360
create

731
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:15,919
so we created an api gateway where this

732
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:17,039
comes and this is where the user

733
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:18,559
identification happens so based on the

734
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:18,960
number

735
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:20,559
or the username i recognize which is the

736
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:22,960
user because based on that user you can

737
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:23,679
actually

738
00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:25,200
send some context right the previous

739
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,360
history chat history of that person

740
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:29,520
that defines the context or probably you

741
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:30,400
know the data

742
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,080
which control and then we do some

743
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:33,679
logging and stuff

744
00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:37,120
then it goes to rasa and it first gets

745
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:37,919
checked you know is it

746
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:40,559
category one or category three and based

747
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:42,000
on that it responds back from

748
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,799
here but it says no it's not cat 1 or

749
00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:46,320
cat 3 then it goes to

750
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:49,520
chatterbot for the category 2. you get

751
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:51,679
the data back from here

752
00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:54,880
and then it

753
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:56,960
responds back and then for category four

754
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,720
it can use either one of this so right

755
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:00,000
now i'm showing people

756
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,640
uh the one but this one also kind of you

757
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:03,200
know

758
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:05,039
uh in the process of integrating so both

759
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:07,120
both of these this together can

760
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:09,200
do it now what happens here is there is

761
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:11,200
a scoring mechanism also so what happens

762
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:13,440
is it gets the response from here

763
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,360
uh every time i get a response from one

764
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:17,600
engine i check the confidence scope

765
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:19,679
uh if you confirm set a threshold there

766
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:21,440
so this let's say the threshold is 80 or

767
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:22,000
higher

768
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
then only i'll get that accepted

769
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,679
response and send it back

770
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:27,360
because it may happen that you know i am

771
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:29,360
able to get a response from one model

772
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:31,279
but the problem is you know it may get a

773
00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:33,120
response which doesn't make sense

774
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:34,640
uh and the way to define is and

775
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:37,360
obviously the the confidence it

776
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:40,640
it has on the response so uh

777
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:44,159
so that's how the structure works now

778
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:46,880
this was almost near real time so you

779
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:48,400
can actually have a conversation you

780
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:50,320
could have a conversation over chat

781
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:52,799
over this interfaces and do it so so

782
00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:53,760
that's what uh

783
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:56,640
that's what uh that's how it works now

784
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,880
moving on one thing was missing so far

785
00:26:58,880 --> 00:26:59,200
was

786
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:02,480
context right so so if you see the data

787
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:03,440
structure although

788
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:05,440
so far i have been this is a q a kind of

789
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:06,720
option right this is the question as

790
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,000
this was the answer this is the question

791
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,360
this is the answer

792
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:11,520
so there was no way i could actually

793
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:12,880
establish a context

794
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:14,799
now this was another model i tried and

795
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:16,240
this was actually already there

796
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:19,520
uh it's a transformer model where uh the

797
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:20,559
idea is

798
00:27:20,559 --> 00:27:22,080
let's say there is a discussion happen

799
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:24,000
you had a chat

800
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,520
now uh whatever response you have given

801
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:30,720
the previous four or five or six

802
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:33,120
defending you can depend define what is

803
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:34,399
the number of context

804
00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:36,159
statements you want to do those

805
00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:38,480
statements become the context for to

806
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:41,200
get this as a response so essentially

807
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,399
the idea here is

808
00:27:42,399 --> 00:27:44,799
saying that you know what i will only

809
00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:45,600
say this

810
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:48,720
when i have this as a context

811
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:50,159
so there is a discussion there is a

812
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:52,240
history i'm talking about right

813
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:54,159
uh so there could be references of

814
00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:56,000
something which i know five statement

815
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:56,640
backgrounds

816
00:27:56,640 --> 00:28:00,159
you spoke about so this context this can

817
00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:01,919
actually give you a sense of

818
00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:03,279
conversation

819
00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:06,080
so this is one concept which takes your

820
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:07,360
uh

821
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:10,960
takes your uh takes your chat from a q a

822
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:12,720
perspective to a conversation

823
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:13,600
perspective

824
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:15,840
right so this is what again you know

825
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:17,360
another thing has been tried

826
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:21,279
and uh unfortunately i did not get

827
00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:24,720
good results however it was uh it was

828
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:25,679
okay

829
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:28,720
uh so so this part can be you know

830
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:30,080
fine-tuned and improved

831
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:32,640
know which can be what can be done so so

832
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,480
yes so overall this is

833
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:37,520
what generates the the engine right the

834
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:38,720
the context

835
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:41,200
uh the chat engine now moving on the

836
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:41,919
voice

837
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:44,640
the voice part is uh there are primarily

838
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:45,760
three model

839
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:48,240
uh which i've tried which is one is taco

840
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:49,919
tron two which is again you know it's a

841
00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:50,320
google

842
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:52,240
google publish this model for voice

843
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:53,360
cloning

844
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:56,480
uh this requires a lot of data uh

845
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:58,960
so i tried uh with let's say around 500

846
00:28:58,960 --> 00:28:59,679
samples of

847
00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:03,039
my my talk i've recorded with let's say

848
00:29:03,039 --> 00:29:05,360
a speech or five to 15 seconds each and

849
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:07,760
then i try to feed it with tacotron i

850
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:09,039
didn't get much uh

851
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:10,720
a good result because they say that i

852
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:12,640
need at least i don't know maybe some

853
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:15,279
10 hours of recordings uh which is

854
00:29:15,279 --> 00:29:16,880
pretty tiresome for me

855
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:20,320
so i couldn't do that real time voice

856
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:21,840
cloning the third one was a very

857
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:22,720
interesting though

858
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:26,159
this thing this is uh which

859
00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:29,279
works at the very less data uh and uh

860
00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:31,679
it actually can generate a voice which

861
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:34,159
is sounds like a cloned voice of yours

862
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:36,080
however the problem is uh this the

863
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:37,520
pretend model was

864
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:40,000
on u.s accent unfortunately being an

865
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,919
indian i have an accent problem right so

866
00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:44,559
uh so my accent doesn't fit well there

867
00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:45,279
now that's why

868
00:29:45,279 --> 00:29:47,120
right now as we speak that there's a

869
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:48,480
training going on on the

870
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:50,000
the middle mall model which is called

871
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,640
cycle gun the cycle gang is

872
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:55,200
actually uh transforming so gang is

873
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,320
actually a

874
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:59,120
category of you know neural network

875
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:00,960
generative

876
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:02,799
adversarial network which is basically

877
00:30:02,799 --> 00:30:04,720
uh what they do is uh

878
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:07,360
they actually transfer your properties

879
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:08,640
of your voice

880
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:11,919
to a pre-recorded voice and and it's

881
00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:14,399
supposed to work with much lesser uh

882
00:30:14,399 --> 00:30:16,960
lesser uh data so this training is going

883
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:18,159
on uh

884
00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:19,679
although there is too much of error so

885
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:22,000
here is a small sample i could get

886
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,360
this is what i'm going to play for you

887
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:26,000
guys so here it out

888
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,320
this is the original one printing in the

889
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:30,240
only sense with which we are at present

890
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:32,320
concerned differs from most if not from

891
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:34,240
all the arts and crafts represented in

892
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:36,480
the exhibition

893
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:38,720
all right and this is the generated one

894
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:51,039
as of now

895
00:30:51,039 --> 00:30:54,240
so as you see there is too much of loss

896
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:56,480
and it was actually not so i could i

897
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:57,519
could make

898
00:30:57,519 --> 00:31:01,120
figure out the wordings sounds

899
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:03,760
sound the voice sounding is slowly

900
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:04,240
getting

901
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:07,120
towards my way of saying however you

902
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:09,360
know the clarity is missing and

903
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:12,000
it it's still getting trained so i hope

904
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,480
you know it will improve over the time

905
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:17,039
so so over the time what so this is the

906
00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:18,799
second level of architecture and voice

907
00:31:18,799 --> 00:31:20,799
with it so assuming the stackatron i

908
00:31:20,799 --> 00:31:22,240
have enough data i can train i am pretty

909
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:23,840
confident that this works

910
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:25,760
now people have tried it and as i said

911
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:27,760
you know my job is not to prove that why

912
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:29,279
is cloning work because there's already

913
00:31:29,279 --> 00:31:31,200
a model it's a matter of data

914
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:34,080
and time and gpu and cost my objective

915
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:36,159
was to build this chat engine

916
00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:37,919
or the conversation engine which can

917
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:39,519
actually have a conversation with

918
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:41,519
it so now what i did i club this thing

919
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:42,960
together and create this as an

920
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:44,080
architecture

921
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:45,679
where what you do is you can actually

922
00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:48,000
talk uh say something

923
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,640
and it can do a speech to text uh

924
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:51,600
conversion

925
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:54,720
uh using google's uh google's api a

926
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:55,760
speech to text

927
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:57,919
then the text goes to this engine and

928
00:31:57,919 --> 00:32:00,159
this engine generates the

929
00:32:00,159 --> 00:32:03,120
response this response then goes to that

930
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:04,399
voice model

931
00:32:04,399 --> 00:32:06,960
and the voice will actually you know

932
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:08,880
will take the text and generate a voice

933
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:11,919
out of output of that

934
00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:14,640
saying that same text and that gets uh

935
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:15,919
replied back

936
00:32:15,919 --> 00:32:18,320
so while this is happening this training

937
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:19,360
is going on

938
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:22,080
just for the demo what i did is i use a

939
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:22,799
google

940
00:32:22,799 --> 00:32:24,720
this another hack i did which is i used

941
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:26,880
google text to speech

942
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:30,559
as a service and i try to take the

943
00:32:30,559 --> 00:32:32,240
so thanks to speech google as multiple

944
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:34,320
person you can actually figure out

945
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:36,559
get defined that you know you can you

946
00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:38,159
want an indian speaker you want an

947
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:40,640
indian speaker with a bengali accent

948
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:43,679
or uh let's say a south indian accent so

949
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:44,000
i

950
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,159
i'd experiment with them and try to get

951
00:32:46,159 --> 00:32:47,600
one which actually

952
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:49,600
has as a probably a similar accent or

953
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:50,960
similar voice

954
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:53,039
right so together with this it can

955
00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:55,600
actually you know create a voice engine

956
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:58,720
which works perfectly fine now comes the

957
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:00,080
face

958
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:02,240
this is very interesting now again i say

959
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:03,600
deep freak and those kind of things

960
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:06,080
already there that was not my objective

961
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:07,679
my objective here was to

962
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:11,919
can i generate a a face

963
00:33:11,919 --> 00:33:15,200
in the real near real time uh so that i

964
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:16,399
can simulate a call

965
00:33:16,399 --> 00:33:19,279
let's say a zoom call or hangout call

966
00:33:19,279 --> 00:33:19,840
and

967
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:22,320
and it should be able to say whatever

968
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:23,039
you know i am

969
00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:26,080
i want them to say uh in terms of lip

970
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:27,760
syncing in terms of you know generating

971
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:28,640
the voice and

972
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:30,720
i know syncing the lips as if it looks

973
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:33,600
like you know i'm saying that

974
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:37,200
so i have used uh two uh uh

975
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:39,919
two libraries uh a project there's a

976
00:33:39,919 --> 00:33:41,440
leap can an audio driven topping

977
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:42,720
headphones

978
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:45,840
now out of these two uh

979
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:49,440
the the lead gun was uh actually a

980
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:51,519
project which gave some more

981
00:33:51,519 --> 00:33:55,200
more realistic result so uh so here is

982
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:55,919
some demo

983
00:33:55,919 --> 00:33:57,919
uh so initial first one is the audio

984
00:33:57,919 --> 00:33:59,760
driven talking get post the first one

985
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:02,240
hello how is life whether is going today

986
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:04,880
when two so today i am not here over who

987
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:07,120
are you where is your house

988
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:09,199
as you can see the face is a little bit

989
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:11,199
shaky uh so it is not actually

990
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:13,760
giving me a good result so this is the

991
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,199
second one

992
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:18,719
today today i am not a robot who are you

993
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:21,599
where is your house so this was much

994
00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:23,119
better but still you know i could see

995
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:24,480
that you know there is a little bit of

996
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:27,520
uh shake and uh it was it was not very

997
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:30,639
very convincing so then uh the lead gun

998
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:32,239
was more convincing so these are the two

999
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:34,560
demo first one was on best generator

1000
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:35,520
from a picture

1001
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:37,918
so let's show you how is it environments

1002
00:34:37,918 --> 00:34:39,520
pack provides it is one of the most

1003
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:42,320
interesting that has been working before

1004
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:44,239
okay as you can see the leap movement

1005
00:34:44,239 --> 00:34:45,918
was you know kind of uh

1006
00:34:45,918 --> 00:34:47,839
realistic now putting it together on a

1007
00:34:47,839 --> 00:34:49,440
video this is how it looks

1008
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:51,440
the examination and testimony of the

1009
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:53,679
experts enabled the commission to

1010
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:54,639
conclude

1011
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:57,760
that five shots may have been fired

1012
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:59,520
so here you can clearly see the lip

1013
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:01,200
syncing was much better

1014
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:03,599
and it was very convincing uh to some

1015
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:05,280
extent right so

1016
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:07,760
so definitely this this overall between

1017
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:09,119
these two model lip can

1018
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:12,480
give us a much better result so now uh

1019
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:14,320
now i club this thing together right so

1020
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:15,920
let's stitch it together so the winter

1021
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:17,599
flow the way it works is

1022
00:35:17,599 --> 00:35:20,400
uh first it uh as i said the brain which

1023
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:21,920
generates the response

1024
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:23,440
then it should go to the voice engine

1025
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:25,119
which will generate the voice

1026
00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:27,200
and then it will should feed this voice

1027
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:28,960
uh into the

1028
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:31,920
to the face engine where it should take

1029
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:33,280
the face video

1030
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:35,760
and impose this voice and it will do a

1031
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:36,720
lip syncing

1032
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:38,880
uh so that uh finally i'll get a video

1033
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:40,079
which looks like

1034
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:42,720
in real time you know it's saying what

1035
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:44,320
i'm saying

1036
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:46,880
now how do i club it together uh for

1037
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:48,240
let's say take it further is

1038
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:49,760
this is where you know the the next

1039
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:51,119
component comes which is the video

1040
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:52,000
streamer

1041
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:55,839
uh cam twist uh with this

1042
00:35:55,839 --> 00:35:58,480
what i do is i created an app uh which

1043
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:00,720
stream between two videos so there's one

1044
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:02,560
video which is a silent video

1045
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:05,359
uh listening as if that i'm just you

1046
00:36:05,359 --> 00:36:07,440
know staring at the camera and listening

1047
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:10,000
to uh what the other person is saying uh

1048
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,240
that's a listening video and

1049
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:13,920
what it does you know it keeps listening

1050
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:15,839
and saying no that video gets to played

1051
00:36:15,839 --> 00:36:16,320
uh

1052
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:18,800
and using cam twist i made it as a as a

1053
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:19,839
virtual camera

1054
00:36:19,839 --> 00:36:22,480
uh to to list a hangout uh so that you

1055
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:23,119
know hang out

1056
00:36:23,119 --> 00:36:25,440
whenever switches on the camera somebody

1057
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:26,400
will see that

1058
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:29,440
this this video a streaming video now

1059
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:30,720
the other thing was this

1060
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:32,720
clone engine which is has a speech to

1061
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:34,320
text recognition and stuff

1062
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:36,720
so the way it works is uh let's say i'm

1063
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:37,920
talking to you

1064
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:41,280
uh so in in hangout you will say hi basu

1065
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:43,440
so my speech recognition module will

1066
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:45,760
take that it will generate the text it

1067
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:47,280
will go to that engine

1068
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:49,040
engine will generate the response that

1069
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,560
will go to the video

1070
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:53,200
uh video will generate the video saying

1071
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:54,320
the response

1072
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:56,640
and then my streamer will switch from

1073
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:58,400
the silent video to the

1074
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:00,320
talking video as if that you know i'm

1075
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:02,160
just stopping it so this is how this

1076
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:03,280
entire model work

1077
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:05,280
and let's see it live in action how it

1078
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:08,000
works so this is a call between lseo and

1079
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,240
me and instead of me it was my bot who

1080
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:23,839
is talking to lsu

1081
00:37:43,839 --> 00:37:46,560
hey how are you

1082
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:51,119
i'm doing very well thanks how are you

1083
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:53,440
good

1084
00:37:58,079 --> 00:38:05,839
tell me

1085
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:12,499
[Music]

1086
00:38:16,839 --> 00:38:19,839
well

1087
00:38:27,359 --> 00:38:29,920
i have no other options for now i am

1088
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:32,640
asking few close friends can you help me

1089
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:34,320
on this

1090
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:34,780
okay

1091
00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:37,760
[Music]

1092
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:41,119
i just need it for this month

1093
00:38:41,599 --> 00:38:43,599
we'll play back in 10 days once i get

1094
00:38:43,599 --> 00:38:47,839
from fox to from me

1095
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:01,839
okay

1096
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:06,480
thanks again so what's new in your life

1097
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:10,640
call me once you are free we'll talk

1098
00:39:12,839 --> 00:39:14,400
bye yo

1099
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:16,400
you are the funniest person i have ever

1100
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:18,640
seen

1101
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:22,160
right so yeah so this is what uh is a

1102
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:24,000
prototype which i have created now as

1103
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,520
you can clearly see here you know there

1104
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:27,200
is always a gap

1105
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:30,240
however this gap was in terms of uh

1106
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:32,800
making the voice more convincing uh

1107
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:34,720
making the facial expressions

1108
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:36,160
probably you know adding some more

1109
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:38,480
emotions to to the

1110
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:40,320
to the voice so those are the things

1111
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:42,079
which is in the roadmap which definitely

1112
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:44,000
you know has to be done now if you

1113
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,599
really want to try it this is the source

1114
00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:46,160
code and

1115
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:48,400
this is uh in my cheetah now if you go

1116
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:50,079
to this date of titan lambda identity

1117
00:39:50,079 --> 00:39:50,720
cloning

1118
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:53,839
you get all the documentation and and

1119
00:39:53,839 --> 00:39:57,119
the steps to set it up and run it uh

1120
00:39:57,119 --> 00:40:00,000
on your own right road ahead as i said

1121
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:00,640
you know

1122
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:02,880
expression uh you know probably

1123
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:04,000
bypassing some

1124
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,160
biometrics those are the things we can

1125
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:07,200
try it out

1126
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:10,160
and as i said i'll be happy to uh happy

1127
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:11,040
to

1128
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:13,839
hear your suggestions on this now last

1129
00:40:13,839 --> 00:40:15,440
but not the least uh

1130
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:16,880
obviously our vision was create

1131
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:18,480
futuristic technology that's what is

1132
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:19,760
neoid is for

1133
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:22,319
and we are doing behavioral biometrics

1134
00:40:22,319 --> 00:40:24,160
and also prevention mechanism to such

1135
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:26,079
kind of adversarial attacks

1136
00:40:26,079 --> 00:40:28,319
so we would definitely need support so

1137
00:40:28,319 --> 00:40:29,200
we're looking for

1138
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:30,800
obviously angels and other people who

1139
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:32,960
can support us to build this kind of

1140
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:34,000
technologies

1141
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,480
right these are various references and

1142
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:38,800
the community support i got

1143
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:41,359
in terms of this idea to prototype and

1144
00:40:41,359 --> 00:40:42,800
building and all this

1145
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:46,000
and last but not the least as i said no

1146
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:46,800
i

1147
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:48,000
with my knowledge and understanding

1148
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
whatever i have i would definitely

1149
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
try to you know kind of build it as a

1150
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,280
course as a workshop

1151
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:56,240
which which i give conduct in various

1152
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:57,200
times so

1153
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:59,920
so thank you so much uh i appreciate
