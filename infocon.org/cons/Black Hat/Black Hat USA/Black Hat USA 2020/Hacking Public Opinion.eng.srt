00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,360
in 1999 we launched the first ever sas

00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:05,200
security solution

4
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:06,960
since then we've been diligently

5
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:08,639
expanding our cloud platform

time

00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:15,200
the result one integrated cloud-based

platform for it

security and operations

11
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:22,640
today we extend the unifying power of

our cloud platform to edr

by this global pandemic

24
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:03,840

jeff moss

66
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:29,200
welcome back it's day two of black cat

67
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,400
briefings

68
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:34,239
usa virtual event okay

69
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:35,920
yesterday we heard from matt blais

70
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,360
keynote around

71
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,519
election integrity today it's going to

72
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:41,440
be hearing about

73
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:44,640
misinformation with renee darista

74
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:47,120
so everybody has a different opinion on

75
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,120
what this information is

76
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:52,160
some people refer to it as information

77
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,480
operations some people it's cognitive

78
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,239
warfare

79
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:58,720
but whatever it is there's not enough

80
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,480
actual research being developed

81
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,040
and studied to inform policy makers to

82
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,720
tell us what to do about it

83
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:07,440
so this one social media company thinks

84
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:08,879
they've found a solution

85
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:11,760
another one thinks they'll label uh fake

86
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:12,480
news

87
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,000
another one thinks they'll ignore fake

88
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,400
news and let the wisdom of the crowd

89
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:19,360
tag the news and fix it for us everybody

90
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,640
has a different approach

91
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,400
and that's exciting because we can test

92
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,840
a lot of different hypotheses but we

93
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:24,640
don't

94
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,640
actually have enough academic rigorous

95
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,239
work being done

96
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:30,319
that's why for me it's pretty exciting

97
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:31,519
to introduce

98
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:34,480
rene desresta who is doing that work at

99
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,280

100
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,680
is part of the internet observatory

101
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,040
trying to determine

102
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:42,319
uh what works and what doesn't how

103
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:44,319
social media platforms are influenced

104
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:46,480
and by what kind of narratives

105
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,959
and so i'm going to introduce you to

106
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:50,080
introduce you to her

107
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,680

116
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,920

117
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,439
narratives across social and media

118

121
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,600
and economic incentives intersect and

122
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,358

138
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:52,320
sorry council on foreign relations as a

00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,840
term member

140
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:56,560
so with that i'd like to introduce you

141
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:59,040
to renee

142
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,759
hi i am honored to be joining you

143
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:06,080
virtually today my name is rene deresta

144
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,840
i am the research manager at stanford

145
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,600
internet observatory

146
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,160
at sio we study the abuse of current

147
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:14,000
information technologies with a focus

148
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,280
on social media and today i'm going to

149
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,199
talk about the evolution of modern day

150
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:21,919
information operations so influence

151
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:24,000
activities executed by state actors

152
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,560
in service to geopolitical goals and i'm

153
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,919
going to discuss the systems and the

154
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:29,600
tactics involved

155
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,199
because information operations

156
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:33,520
increasingly involve the full spectrum

157
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,680
of overt to covert propaganda

158
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:38,160
mass media as well as social media agent

159
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,680
of influence activities

160
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:43,440
and at times network infiltration

161
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,800
so i'm going to start off with a few

162
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,960
definitions first we'll go with

163
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:48,240
misinformation

164
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,600
so this is something that's in the news

165
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,360
a lot lately particularly in the context

166
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,120
of covid19

167
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,880
it's information that's inadvertently

168
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:57,280
wrong and people are usually sharing it

169
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,639
because they want to inform their

170
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:00,639
communities they see it as

171
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:02,080
kind of altruistic they're helping

172
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,319
people understand what's going on in the

173
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:04,960
world

174
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:07,039
even if the information is inadvertently

175
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:08,720
wrong

176
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,280
but disinformation is information that's

177
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,880
deliberately misleading

178
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:15,199
so the person who's sharing it has the

179
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:16,720
intent to influence

180
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:19,120
and the intent to deceive they know the

181
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:19,840
information is

182
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:22,000
wrong they know the information is

183
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,759
misleading or malign

184
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:25,360
or not coming from the source they're

185
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,880
claiming it comes from but they're

186
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:29,120
sharing it anyway

187
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,600
and then there's propaganda so this is a

188
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,960
term that carries a lot of weight it's

189
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,240
very loaded

190
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:37,039
originally when it was first the first

191
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:39,280
kind of first incarnations of the term

192
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:42,160
it was not a pejorative it's come to be

193
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,039
seen that way

194
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:44,880
but i'm going to use it to describe

195
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,840
information with an agenda

196
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:49,680
information where the specifics of the

197
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,520
agenda varies but the intent of the

198
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:52,560
communication

199
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,720
is to persuade someone or to distract

200
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,560
them or to make them take an action or

201
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,560
feel a certain way

202
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,479
propaganda is not always factually

203
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:02,800
inaccurate it's not always deceptive

204
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,080
and we're going to discuss that a little

205
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,000
bit in this talk

206
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,120
and then finally agents of influence so

207
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:09,680
this is

208
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,199
somebody who works to influence an

209
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:13,440
audience and unbeknownst to that

210
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:14,400
audience

211
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:17,520
they're beholden to somebody else so

212
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,960
they're operating in service to a

213
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,560
powerful figure uh

214
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,160
an intelligence agency a state

215
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,759
government and so

216
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:26,160
this is information and persuasion in

217
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,240
service to an agenda

218
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,360
and then the last thing that we're going

219
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,680
to talk about are is network

220
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:32,639
infiltration

221
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:34,080
which i don't think i need to define for

222
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,639
this audience

223
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:40,240
so propaganda disinformation using false

224
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,240
identities to influence communities

225
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:45,120
these are all very old phenomenon uh one

226
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,199
popular term describing their strategic

227
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:47,840
use

228
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:50,240
active measures comes from the cold war

229
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:50,879
um

230
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:53,280
but the process of shaping public

231
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,360
opinion by creating propaganda

232
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,199
distributing it in the media spreading

233
00:07:57,199 --> 00:07:59,840
it via via peer-to-peer transmission

234
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,120
can actually be traced back to the

235
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:04,080
emergence of the printing press

236
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,080
so we can think of how information

237
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,199
reaches audiences

238
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:10,319
as kind of a staged process there is

239
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:13,599
uh the creation phase somebody produces

240
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:14,400
the content

241
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,639
there's the dissemination phase uh

242
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:18,080
somebody kind of puts the content out

243
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,280
into the world

244
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:21,120
in our olden days era of the printing

245
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,120
press the last you know the last

246
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:25,039
kind of stage was really hope hope that

247
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:26,400
it reached somebody

248
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,919
the dissemination phase during the

249
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:29,599
printing press era was literally handing

250
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:31,039
off pamphlets to people

251
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:33,440
in bars and pubs so this is where you

252
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,360
start to see

253
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,719
that dissemination piece being

254
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:38,479
absolutely critical to actually getting

255
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:40,719
a message to propagate and spread

256
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:43,760
so the process was very slow back in the

257
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:44,720
era of

258
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:47,279
of print media with the era of broadcast

259
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:47,760
media

260
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,920
like television and radio what you start

261
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,120
to see is

262
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,880
increases in the size of the audience

263
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,640
you can reach a lot more people

264
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,640
with a lot less effort but ultimately

265
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,480
the process was the same

266
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:01,120
there were significant gatekeepers both

267
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:03,279
financially and in terms of editorial

268
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:04,650
control

269
00:09:04,650 --> 00:09:05,920
[Music]

270
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,920
but then we skip ahead to the era of the

271
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:08,959
internet

272
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:11,680
and so in the early 2000s we get to the

273
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:13,200
kind of dawn of the blogosphere maybe

274
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,040
late 1990s actually

275
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,640
um so we get to the emergence of a

276
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,160
technological system

277
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:20,080
designed for the effortless creation of

278
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,200
content

279
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:24,959
so blogs offer zero cost publishing

280
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:27,120
anybody can set one up there's you know

281
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,560
basically no hosting costs if you're

282
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,000
using a service like geocities or

283
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,120
blogger

284
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:33,200
everybody writes what they want to but

285
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,120
ultimately the blogosphere is still very

286
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,240
decentralized

287
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,880
and if you had one like i did you

288
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,399
probably know that almost nobody ever

289
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:42,959
read your stuff

290
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:46,160
but a few years after that we hit the

291
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,920
era of the social networks the social

292
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,040
platforms

293
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:53,040
and these sites start out

294
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,399
as ways for people to just kind of

295
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:55,600
connect with their immediate friends

296
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,279
their immediate social circle

297
00:09:57,279 --> 00:09:59,279
but in a way they begin to kind of solve

298
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:00,720
distribution

299
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,880
so all of a sudden i have platforms that

300
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,959
are inviting me to share my thoughts

301
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:07,200
and there's a built-in audience instead

302
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,959
of me writing a blog post and emailing

303
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:09,920
it out to people

304
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:12,720
instead what happens is i write a really

305
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,399
short snippet how are you feeling today

306
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:15,600
what are you thinking about you know

307
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,959
these are the prompts

308
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:18,160
and then the platform automatically

309
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,839
pushes it out to the people who follow

310
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:22,160
me or who are in my friend circle

311
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:25,920
so the feeds are designed for engagement

312
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:28,240
the platforms want to keep people online

313
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,920
and so they built in these tools

314
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:30,640
gradually

315
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,640
but over the first few years of platform

316
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:33,839
you know kind of social platform

317
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:34,720
development

318
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,560
you start to see content creation get

319
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:38,240
even easier the barriers to entry

320
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,519
reducing even more

321
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:40,560
and they begin to solve that

322
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,880
dissemination piece

323
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,880
people become an integral part of the

324
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,800
process of pushing content along

325
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,720
we begin to see the idea of virality i

326
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:49,839
hit the share button

327
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:51,519
and all of a sudden all of the tens of

328
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:53,279
thousands of people potentially

329
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:55,120
in various kind of cascades through my

330
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:57,040
social network see the stuff that i care

331
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,320
about

332
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,320
so we wind up at this point with a glut

333
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,760
of material uh

334
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,120
we've eliminated the editorial

335
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,880
gatekeepers we've eliminated the cost

336
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,079
barriers to entry

337
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:07,920
and so what we begin to have is

338
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,920
algorithmic curation

339
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:12,480
algorithms surface and recommend and

340
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:13,519
rate content

341
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:15,680
they rank it and then they help amplify

342
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:16,720
and disseminate it

343
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,560
so this becomes a very kind of tech

344
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,240
mediated process

345
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,320
that that ensures that information hits

346
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:25,120
large numbers of people

347
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:27,760
so in summary we have individual

348
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:28,560
platforms

349
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,560
each with a large standing audience

350
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:31,839
precision targeting

351
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:33,200
and then algorithms that play a

352
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,680
significant role in deciding what we see

353
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,279
and those algorithms of course are

354
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:39,120
gameable which we're going to talk about

355
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:42,480
as this talk progresses

356
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:45,120
so each individual platform kind of has

357
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,399
those three criterias

358
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:48,480
and then in aggregate the platforms

359
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,399
comprise a social media communication

360
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:51,760
ecosystem

361
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:54,320
so each of the platforms up here on my

362
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:54,959
slide

363
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:56,480
has some variation in what kind of

364
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,160
content it specializes in

365
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,399
how it's disseminated but ultimately

366
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:02,800
this collection of apps and platforms

367
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:05,440
together comprises a very low cost

368
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:06,399
convenient way

369
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:08,639
to reach massive numbers of people at a

370
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:11,440
global scale

371
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,839
and it's the structure of this system

372
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:16,399
the features the policies the design

373
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:18,160
that set the rules of engagement for

374
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:21,040
modern influence

375
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:24,240
so anyone politicians marketers

376
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,040
activists

377
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:27,839
can use the system the ways that we

378
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:29,600
exert influence the forms that

379
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:30,880
propaganda takes

380
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,639
are determined by the information

381
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:34,000
environment of the day

382
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,040
that's been true for centuries but

383
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,720
as we move from just the idea of

384
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,720
influence to the idea of information

385
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,480
operations specifically

386
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,560
again operations conducted by state

387
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:47,519
actors in service to geopolitical goals

388
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:50,320
what you start to see is it goes from

389
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,760
shaping public opinion

390
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:52,880
to what we're going to call hacking

391
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:55,279
public opinion using manipulative

392
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:58,240
misleading tactics to kind of commandeer

393
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,079
that ecosystem that i've described

394
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:01,600
those technological processes i've

395
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,839
described and put to use kind of

396
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:06,000
achieving the information aims

397
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,279
of a particular state actor so

398
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:12,399
as early as 2004 state actors begin to

399
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:13,360
realize

400
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,800
that this infrastructure is at their

401
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,560
disposal as well and that

402
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,880
they can turn the social web into a vast

403
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:21,440
propaganda and disinformation machine

404
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,680
they can use fake accounts so fake

405
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,120
accounts are the kind of modern

406
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,079
incarnation

407
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:28,720
of agents of influence they can game the

408
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,000
algorithms

409
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,320
they can create front media properties

410
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:34,480
that actively mislead the public

411
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,399
which is another very very old tactic

412
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:37,760
that suddenly become effortless to

413
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:39,120
execute

414
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,800
and they can do all of this quickly and

415
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,800
cheaply because they're ultimately using

416
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:43,440
the system

417
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:46,639
as it was designed to be used

418
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:48,560
so the campaigns that state actors run

419
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,560
generally take one of four forms

420
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:52,560
we see distraction which is trying to

421
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,160
make a target audience pay attention to

422
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,279
something else

423
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:56,880
we see persuasion which is trying to

424
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,880
convince people to believe a certain

425
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,079
fact or

426
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:03,360
feel a certain way we see entrenchment

427
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,959
this is where there's the creation of

428
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:06,800
groups dedicated to particular types of

429
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,320
identities in particular

430
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,519
where what you start to see is

431
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:10,959
entrenching people in a position

432
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:12,959
entrenching people in an identity

433
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:15,600
and then divide using that entrenchment

434
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:16,320
to kind of

435
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,959
cast uh to kind of highlight divisions

436
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:20,560
between different groups of people

437
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:24,120
amplifying existing social fissures

438
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:25,760
[Music]

439
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:27,920
so if we were to go back to our creation

440
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:28,959
dissemination

441
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:31,760
kind of hope model from the era of the

442
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,040
printing press and update it for the

443
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:35,279
modern era of the internet

444
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:37,120
now what we see in information

445
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:39,519
operations is state actors that create

446
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:41,040
personas

447
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:43,519
they create content they seed that

448
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:45,279
content to social media they seed it to

449
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:47,680
an initial standing target audience

450
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:50,240
they coordinate amplification usually

451
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,600
through something like algorithmic

452
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:52,560
manipulation

453
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:55,120
or kind of mass posting in a variety of

454
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:56,720
different groups at one time

455
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,000
but then what happens is they get

456
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,839
organic shares

457
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:01,600
so this is where as much as you know

458
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,360
early conversations about russia focused

459
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,240
on the ads

460
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,639
only a hundred thousand dollars of ads

461
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:07,760
the real

462
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:10,000
lift there didn't come from the ads at

463
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,920
all it came from creating content that

464
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:13,680
was compelling to people

465
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,440
and then people serving as the

466
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:16,800
transmission vector

467
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,160
so this peer-to-peer kind of

468
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:20,000
participatory propaganda model

469
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,240
that pushes this content out because it

470
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:24,560
resonates with people

471
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,720
and then after a certain kind of

472
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:28,399
critical mass of people is talking about

473
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:29,199
a topic

474
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:31,199
you'll often see mass media pickup and

475
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:32,320
so we're going to talk about that as

476
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,920
well

477
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:35,680
one of the things that we do at stanford

478
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:36,959
internet observatory

479
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:38,639
is we try to understand processes like

480
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:41,199
this almost in a

481
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:43,360
kind of like a staged path that certain

482
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,199
actors follow consistently

483
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:46,560
so we can think about it almost like a

484
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:47,839
kill chain like where could you

485
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:48,720
intervene

486
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,930
at the various steps in this process

487
00:15:50,930 --> 00:15:52,240
[Music]

488
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:54,000
if you wanted to stop people from

489
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,600
creating personas how would you think

490
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,519
about what that creation process looks

491
00:15:57,519 --> 00:15:59,040
like or what those personas look like

492
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:00,320
and think about ways to intercede at

493
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,720
that point

494
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,199
but ultimately there is a lot more than

495
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:07,519
simply social media at work here

496
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:09,759
so that last hop that hopped from

497
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:11,839
organic shares to broadcast media to

498
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:13,040
mass media pickup

499
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:16,000
is actually critically important the

500
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,920
relationship

501
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:19,680
between broadcast media and i'm

502
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,279
including print in that there's there's

503
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:22,000
no good term

504
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,079
for everything but social um but the

505
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:27,680
in a way there probably shouldn't be

506
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,600
right so mass media does include social

507
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:30,240
media

508
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,240
and so what we want to think about as we

509
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,920
talk about full spectrum influence

510
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:35,680
operations or full spectrum information

511
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:36,720
operations

512
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:39,279
is the way in which the broadcast

513
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:40,160
portion

514
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:42,800
of a state's propaganda apparatus feeds

515
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:45,279
into the social media operation

516
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:47,519
and then the ways that social media

517
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:48,639
offers significant

518
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:50,880
kind of options for agents of influence

519
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:54,560
and persona based persuasion

520
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:57,040
so we're going to switch here from

521
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:58,240
theory to case studies

522
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:59,680
and just kind of walk through what that

523
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:00,740
looks like

524
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:03,440
[Music]

525
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:06,319
so let's start with china uh china is

526
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:08,240
emerging as a powerful player in the

527
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:09,839
information operations arena

528
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:11,599
it's a lot of conversation about what

529
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:12,959
china is doing with information

530
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:14,480
operations right now

531
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,319
those of you in the audience are already

532
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:18,079
familiar with their network infiltration

533
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,439
capabilities

534
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:21,679
which again they split between the pla

535
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:23,119
some military entities and private

536
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:24,959
contractors

537
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:26,799
there are some similar splits in how

538
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:27,919
they think about their propaganda

539
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:29,919
apparatus

540
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:32,160
so when we talk about that broadcast or

541
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,240
mass media capability

542
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:36,559
um china has decades of experience in

543
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:38,080
both overt and covert narrative

544
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:39,120
management

545
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,799
the government has prioritized it for

546
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:42,799
decades particularly

547
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:45,120
inward looking so a lot of china's

548
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:47,200
capabilities were developed

549
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,400
for the purpose of controlling

550
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,559
information within china

551
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:53,360
and so what we're seeing now is how

552
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:54,799
they're taking those inward-facing

553
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:56,160
capabilities

554
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:58,000
and beginning to expand outward

555
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,520
beginning to kind of deploy those same

556
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:00,559
tactics

557
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:02,080
in areas and regions where they want to

558
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:05,360
have influence outside of their borders

559
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:08,000
so when we talk about media based

560
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:08,880
propaganda

561
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,960
there's a metaphor that researchers like

562
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:14,320
to use of a monochromatic spectrum and

563
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:17,200
that monochromatic spectrum corresponds

564
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,559
to how attributable

565
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:21,760
the content is so on the

566
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:24,640
left over here we have overt content

567
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:27,200
like china daily or the people's daily

568
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,280
the ccp spends billions of dollars on

569
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:31,120
dozens and dozens of these newspapers

570
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:33,120
and broadcast channels

571
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:35,120
they are regionalized for areas of

572
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:36,880
interest

573
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:39,600
they are language localized but they are

574
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,520
very very obviously

575
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:44,000
attributable to the chinese communist

576
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:44,640
party

577
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,799
so there's no concealment of where that

578
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:49,600
information is coming from or what it is

579
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,039
so this is what we call white propaganda

580
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:52,799
sometimes

581
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:54,320
but then we get into that gray area in

582
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:56,000
the middle and for

583
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,600
china this takes the form of things like

584
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,280
content farms

585
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:02,480
which are websites that echo ccp talking

586
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,799
points with kind of uncanny frequency

587
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:07,200
or they push out fake political stories

588
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,080
about uh

589
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,960
rivals rival government ministers people

590
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,559
who have in some way you know

591
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:14,000
taiwanese politicians who have

592
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,760
displeased beijing

593
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:17,440
but it's really hard to tell whether

594
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:19,200
they're actually attributable

595
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:22,559
as mouthpieces of the state sometimes

596
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:23,919
digging shows that there's a financial

597
00:19:23,919 --> 00:19:26,400
relationship or ties between the owner

598
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,240
of the site and a government minister

599
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:30,080
but the attributability of the message

600
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,360
remains concealed

601
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:34,480
and that's our kind of gray area and

602
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:35,919
then finally there's the wholly

603
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:36,880
unattributable

604
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:39,360
dark part of the spectrum which usually

605
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:40,320
involves

606
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:42,799
very active misdirection so this is

607
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:43,840
where you hear

608
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:46,080
the word inauthentic being tossed around

609
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:47,760
right so

610
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:50,400
the example i picked here it says dream

611
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,120
news

612
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:53,360
that site doesn't appear to exist it

613
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:55,520
existed largely as a twitter property

614
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,440
to talk about the hong kong protesters

615
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:58,559
and ultimately

616
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:01,039
twitter attributed it to the ccp and

617
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:03,840
took down the account

618
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:07,440
the overall goal of that entire

619
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,039
broadcast apparatus

620
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:11,840
is to tell china's story well so

621
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:13,919
referring back to the distract persuade

622
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:15,440
and trench divide framework

623
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:16,720
china's primarily concerned with

624
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:20,400
persuasion sometimes distraction

625
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,720
and when we think about the intersection

626
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,159
of that overt

627
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:26,400
broadcast propaganda ecosystem and then

628
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,640
even the kind of more subversive gray

629
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:31,360
and and black media kind of properties

630
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:32,080
on the

631
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:34,320
far side of that monochromatic spectrum

632
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:35,760
the

633
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,280
there's an intersection with social

634
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:38,799
media so

635
00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:41,600
the overt propaganda properties even

636
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:43,679
though facebook is banned in china

637
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:46,640
all have absolutely massive facebook

638
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:47,600
pages

639
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:50,400
so cgtn for example has 106.7 million

640
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:51,840
followers

641
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:53,840
so since these platforms are banned in

642
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:54,880
china this is

643
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:57,360
quite clearly intended for audiences

644
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:58,880
outside of china so this is how we think

645
00:20:58,880 --> 00:20:59,600
about

646
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,360
full spectrum information operations in

647
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,120
the form of using

648
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:06,400
these powerful broadcast tools on social

649
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:07,120
media

650
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:09,919
and they can they they persist in trying

651
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:11,600
to grow their follower accounts

652
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,840
uh trying to amass influence globally

653
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:15,120
and you can go and you can look at the

654
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:16,480
ads that they run and you can see where

655
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:17,840
they're targeting the ads

656
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:19,520
and so you can see the amassing of

657
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,280
audiences beyond the borders

658
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,039
using the ad tools that facebook makes

659
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:25,039
available to them

660
00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:27,039
so they're running ads to kind of boost

661
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:30,559
their content to the rest of the world

662
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:32,559
but beyond the expansion and to overt

663
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:34,480
social media there's also the

664
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:38,000
kind of uh dark spectrum of social media

665
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:38,720
as well

666
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:41,840
so ccp has expanded uh to

667
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:44,799
into beginning to incorporate troll

668
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:45,360
accounts

669
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:48,000
and fake cutout media properties so this

670
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,679
is in a way an outgrowth of a strategy

671
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:50,559
that they've deployed

672
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:53,440
inwardly since 2004 there's the 50 cent

673
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:54,159
party or the

674
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:56,480
mal the kind of fake commenter army used

675
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:57,679
to distract

676
00:21:57,679 --> 00:21:59,919
within china and we see that tactic

677
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:00,960
being ported

678
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:03,919
to facebook and twitter so the hong kong

679
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:04,960
protests

680
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:08,320
these are all this is the images on the

681
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:09,840
slide are collateral

682
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:12,400
from twitter takedown and a facebook

683
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,360
takedown in

684
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:16,159
august and september of 2019. so this is

685
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:17,200
attributable

686
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:20,799
subversive uh kind of black propaganda

687
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:22,960
from you know deployed on social media

688
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:25,679
in the form of these fake accounts

689
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:28,480
so hong kong protests were the first

690
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:30,400
topic on which western social media

691
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,200
platforms

692
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,880
concretely attributed activity to the

693
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:35,600
ccp the hong kong protests attracted

694
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,200
worldwide attention

695
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,600
and what you began to see was as western

696
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,520
media and others began to talk about

697
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:42,400
them

698
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,320
these twitter accounts would kind of

699
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:45,600
come out of the woodwork

700
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:48,559
to to respond to the journalists to tell

701
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:50,159
them no they had it wrong

702
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:52,640
or regular people who expressed sympathy

703
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:54,000
or solidarity with the hong kong

704
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,400
protesters would be deluged by these

705
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:57,120
accounts

706
00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:00,400
telling them that high profile

707
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,919
incidents you know kind of clashes

708
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:03,760
between protesters and police

709
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:06,080
were being misreported by western media

710
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:07,760
pretending to be local people on the

711
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:08,080
ground

712
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:10,080
in hong kong who just wanted to set the

713
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:12,720
record straight

714
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:17,039
so after the first twitter takedown

715
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:20,480
in august and september of 2019

716
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:22,400
those of us who researched the

717
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,400
operations looked at the accounts

718
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:27,679
were given a second data set in june of

719
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:30,240
2020 so just about a month ago

720
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:34,080
and the image on screen here

721
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:36,320
is something that we produced where we

722
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:37,120
looked at

723
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:38,720
the topics that the accounts were

724
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:40,640
talking about when the accounts were

725
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:41,679
created

726
00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:44,880
so what you started to see was the

727
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:47,200
immediate reconstituting of the account

728
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:47,679
so they

729
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:49,919
lost their hong kong bots so to speak

730
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:51,200
hong kong personas

731
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:53,760
in the early takedown and immediately

732
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:55,679
the creation dates of the accounts that

733
00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:57,279
came down in june 2020

734
00:23:57,279 --> 00:23:59,039
uh date back to 2019 a lot of them were

735
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:00,960
created in 2019.

736
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:03,440
so what we start to see is again the

737
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:05,279
pink accounts are talking about

738
00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:08,400
hong kong the green accounts are

739
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:12,159
are attacking a a dissonant uh going way

740
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:14,720
the kind of dark blue and yellow as you

741
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,159
see appear off to the side

742
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:17,440
that's around the time of the taiwan

743
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:20,480
election and then the last

744
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,159
uh the last group of accounts that are

745
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:24,320
created and kind of turned on to talk

746
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:26,240
about topics of interest to china talk

747
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:28,480
about covet 19.

748
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:31,200
so again what we see here is a

749
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,159
commitment

750
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:35,279
to turning on these accounts they're not

751
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:37,120
developed over kind of a long time

752
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,559
horizon with a lot of forethought

753
00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:40,960
they're very much a reaction to a

754
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,559
precipitating crisis that the government

755
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:44,320
feels it has to respond to

756
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:46,799
or a topic of interest that it feels

757
00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:48,480
that it needs to address

758
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:51,200
and so the coved crisis you know these

759
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:54,080
accounts are created in january of 2020

760
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:56,320
um the pandemic has been a domestic and

761
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:58,159
international crisis for china

762
00:24:58,159 --> 00:25:00,480
it was accused of cover-ups domestically

763
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:02,400
of mishandling the pandemic

764
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:04,799
both domestically and internationally

765
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:06,159
and there were of course claims that it

766
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:07,360
was culpable

767
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:10,000
for a global disaster so it began this

768
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,200
full court press

769
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:13,440
to kind of hack public opinion with

770
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:17,039
regard to covet 19 narratives

771
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:20,240
and what we see is the entirety of the

772
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:22,960
broadcast ecosystem the social ecosystem

773
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:24,799
all of the overt and covert means at its

774
00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:27,039
disposal put to use pushing out a

775
00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:28,240
particular narrative

776
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:31,679
about coronavirus so we see in trench

777
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:33,360
persuade distract divide you know all of

778
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:33,840
the

779
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:36,400
methods kind of put to work across the

780
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:38,720
entire spectrum here so we have

781
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:41,840
within china oops within china we have

782
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:43,600
the sort of censorship of individuals

783
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:45,200
and information channels

784
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:47,279
to control the domestic perception so in

785
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:48,559
the center there

786
00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:50,080
you see one of the whistleblower doctors

787
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:52,159
who then unfortunately went on to pass

788
00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:53,840
away from the virus

789
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:57,440
um you see massive english language

790
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:58,720
state media pages

791
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:00,559
writing posts about the world health

792
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:04,080
organization praising china's response

793
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:05,919
those posts were then boosted on

794
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:07,760
facebook using facebook's ad tools to

795
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:09,440
ensure that they reached large global

796
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:11,039
audiences

797
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:13,440
there were overt attributable social

798
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,520
media accounts belonging to

799
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:17,760
uh chinese diplomats minister of foreign

800
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:19,120
affairs down there

801
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:22,080
um you see you know they're using kind

802
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,039
of

803
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:25,279
they they flip back and forth between

804
00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:26,640
funny things that are likely to be

805
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:28,480
retweeted because they're engaging

806
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:29,919
uh this there's they're tweeting

807
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:31,600
conspiracy theories they're linking to

808
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:32,559
kind of

809
00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:35,520
um media sites like global research a

810
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:37,840
kind of known conspiracy theory site

811
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:39,919
they're being a lot more aggressive in

812
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:41,360
their communications

813
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:42,960
and then what you'll see a lot of the

814
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:44,880
time is when these prominent

815
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:47,440
figures tweet uh the kind of bot

816
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:48,480
accounts kind of come out of the

817
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,080
woodwork to retweet and amplify so

818
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:51,279
that's an interesting dynamic that

819
00:26:51,279 --> 00:26:52,000
happens

820
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,080
where does the lift come from again if

821
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:56,159
you make a if you if you create a

822
00:26:56,159 --> 00:26:57,679
sufficient amount of lift

823
00:26:57,679 --> 00:27:00,720
using inauthentic accounts it will often

824
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:01,360
times

825
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:03,679
create this uh indication that a lot of

826
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:04,799
people have been talking about or

827
00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:05,600
tweeting this

828
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,600
you know retweeting this this content

829
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:09,120
that makes real people begin to pay

830
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:09,760
attention

831
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:11,520
and then real people begin to retweet

832
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:12,720
and that's how you kind of cross that

833
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:13,440
chasm from

834
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:15,440
inauthentic into authentic and get

835
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:16,880
additional lift

836
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:18,799
and then of course from the prior slide

837
00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:20,720
covert twitter accounts were revealed to

838
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:22,850
have praised china's pandemic response

839
00:27:22,850 --> 00:27:24,640
[Music]

840
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:27,679
but now i want to caveat something so

841
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:30,720
the june dataset june 2020 takedown

842
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:34,399
consisted of 23 800 followers i'm sorry

843
00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:37,919
23 800 accounts but 92

844
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:39,760
of those accounts had less than 10

845
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:41,279
followers

846
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:44,080
that's that's pretty terrible um the

847
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:45,360
accounts tweeted

848
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:48,240
about 350 000 times and the average

849
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:49,760
engagement per tweet

850
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:53,120
was 0.81 so most of the tweets didn't

851
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:54,159
even have a single

852
00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:57,600
like retweet or favorite um

853
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:01,279
the max tweet engagement was 3700

854
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:04,559
so across the entirety of this you know

855
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:05,360
kind of

856
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:08,720
almost six to nine month operation

857
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:12,399
um they really didn't do a very good job

858
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:14,799
at actually getting real people to pick

859
00:28:14,799 --> 00:28:16,080
up their content and amplify

860
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:18,080
it this is relatively terrible

861
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:20,320
engagement

862
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:22,880
so one of the reasons for that the graph

863
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:23,760
i've got up here

864
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:27,279
is a retweet ring so the

865
00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:29,440
six accounts in the center are kind of

866
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:30,880
irrelevant to the point of this but

867
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:32,559
what you see around there are the names

868
00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:35,120
of the accounts that are retweeting them

869
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:37,679
and as we look at the dynamics around

870
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:38,559
the retweets

871
00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:41,120
you see accounts that were all created

872
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:42,159
on the same day

873
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:44,480
at the same time they use blocks of

874
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:45,840
related usernames

875
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:49,200
stock profile photos primitive

876
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:50,399
biographies if they even have a

877
00:28:50,399 --> 00:28:51,440
biography

878
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:53,360
so these are barely agents of influence

879
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:54,640
this is actually kind of

880
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:58,080
shockingly poor and the point is while

881
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:00,240
china excels in certain areas

882
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:01,840
you know the broadcast propaganda

883
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:04,640
audiences are massive um the engagement

884
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:07,279
is actually not as as significant as you

885
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:08,159
would think

886
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:10,960
so press frequently compares chinese

887
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:13,039
activities to the russia activities

888
00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:15,840
but this kind of sloppy social media

889
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:18,720
activity actually more closely mirrors

890
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:21,600
saudi arabia which kind of pumps out low

891
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,039
quality bot content when it needs to

892
00:29:23,039 --> 00:29:24,159
distract somebody

893
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:25,520
like around the time of the murder of

894
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:27,440
jamal khashoggi

895
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:29,039
so how do we think about this as we

896
00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:30,960
develop our understanding of

897
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:34,559
modern information operations china is a

898
00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:36,480
well-resourced state adversary

899
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:39,039
it has developed significant

900
00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:40,480
capabilities in certain parts of the

901
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:41,760
ecosystem

902
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:43,840
the respawn of the accounts indicates

903
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:45,440
that this is a strategy that it is now

904
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:46,480
committed to

905
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:47,919
and will likely be trying to get better

906
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:49,520
at

907
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:50,960
they're updating their capabilities

908
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:52,480
they're modernizing tactics that they've

909
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:53,600
used for decades

910
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:54,960
to fit the modern information

911
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:58,080
environment but at the same time

912
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:00,080
we shouldn't overstate the impact of the

913
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:01,679
efforts

914
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:02,799
a lot of times you'll see kind of

915
00:30:02,799 --> 00:30:05,039
breathless press coverage talking up

916
00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:07,120
some metric from the operation 300

917
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:08,159
thousand accounts or

918
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:10,159
thirty thousand uh tweets you know

919
00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:11,360
millions of tweets

920
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:14,559
that kind of breathless

921
00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:17,039
um kind of pumping up uh elevating it to

922
00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:18,240
something it wasn't

923
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:20,080
really in some ways helps the adversary

924
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:21,679
makes them seem a lot more powerful than

925
00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:23,200
they actually are

926
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:25,120
so what we want to do as we think about

927
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:26,559
this as infosec professionals and

928
00:30:26,559 --> 00:30:28,720
information operations researchers

929
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:30,399
is recognize that we expect china to

930
00:30:30,399 --> 00:30:32,559
improve we should study the content

931
00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:34,159
we should work on identifying the kind

932
00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:36,320
of ttps that indicate that

933
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:38,480
that the uh that an operation is coming

934
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:39,360
from china

935
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:41,200
but we have to remain clear-headed about

936
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:42,640
how impactful the

937
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:45,120
activity actually was and in the context

938
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:46,960
of the chinese operations that i've been

939
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:47,919
discussing

940
00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:50,960
the social media component really was in

941
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:52,910
large part a failure

942
00:30:52,910 --> 00:30:55,760
[Music]

943
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:57,360
the press compares china to russia

944
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:58,799
though because russia is

945
00:30:58,799 --> 00:31:01,200
at the moment kind of best in class for

946
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:03,039
information operations

947
00:31:03,039 --> 00:31:04,880
they've also demonstrated not only a

948
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:07,360
commitment to full spectrum propaganda

949
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:10,000
but to far more sophisticated activities

950
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,840
related to agents of influence

951
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:13,519
to media manipulation and then

952
00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:15,679
ultimately to network infiltration as

953
00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:16,399
well

954
00:31:16,399 --> 00:31:19,039
and so i want to talk about the ways in

955
00:31:19,039 --> 00:31:19,919
which

956
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:21,600
russia has managed not only to hack

957
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:22,960
public opinion

958
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:26,559
by uh kind of working the social

959
00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:27,679
ecosystem

960
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:30,159
but to hack public opinion by hacking

961
00:31:30,159 --> 00:31:32,080
public officials and institutions

962
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:34,960
and using the information it obtains in

963
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:36,640
information operations deployed on

964
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:38,580
broadcast and social media

965
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:41,760
[Music]

966
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:43,360
so we can go through that same process

967
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:44,799
of looking at our kind of monochromatic

968
00:31:44,799 --> 00:31:46,399
spectrum and

969
00:31:46,399 --> 00:31:48,720
um and examining what russia has in this

970
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:49,440
regard

971
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:51,600
so they spend a fraction of the budget

972
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:53,039
that china does on their

973
00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:54,880
on their state media properties but they

974
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,720
do have a full spectrum of narrative

975
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:59,440
capabilities for outwardly focused

976
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:02,080
communications so over there on the left

977
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:03,679
and the broadly attributable space we've

978
00:32:03,679 --> 00:32:05,039
got rt

979
00:32:05,039 --> 00:32:08,159
um in the middle this is a

980
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:11,200
uh this is a blog called off guardian or

981
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:13,600
micro publication called off guardian

982
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:15,200
what's interesting about this is

983
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:16,640
it's an astonishingly sympathetic

984
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,880
publication and the article that i've

985
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:20,799
got up here terrorists are equipped

986
00:32:20,799 --> 00:32:23,440
uh with western weapons in syria is

987
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:24,159
written by

988
00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:25,760
a journalist to purport a journalist

989
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:28,000
named anazionger from inside syria

990
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:31,279
media center and as it turns out inside

991
00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:33,360
syria media center is a gre front

992
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:36,240
on a junger does not exist but numerous

993
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:37,519
of these properties

994
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:39,840
would take and run content from inside

995
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:41,120
syria media center

996
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:43,760
kind of serving as a conduit for the

997
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:44,880
information

998
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:47,039
from this fake front operation to be

999
00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:48,080
laundered through

1000
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:52,000
to uh to kind of real media properties

1001
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,279
with

1002
00:32:53,279 --> 00:32:56,559
you know undiscernable ties and then

1003
00:32:56,559 --> 00:32:57,760
finally on the right we have the

1004
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:59,039
complete misdirection

1005
00:32:59,039 --> 00:33:01,600
this is a site called black matters us

1006
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:03,200
it was purportedly run

1007
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:05,039
by black lives matters activists in the

1008
00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:07,519
u.s in reality it was later attributed

1009
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:09,279
to internet trolls operating out of the

1010
00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:10,000
internet research

1011
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:13,120
agency in st petersburg so again the

1012
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:14,799
kind of dark side of that broadcast

1013
00:33:14,799 --> 00:33:16,159
propaganda spectrum

1014
00:33:16,159 --> 00:33:18,480
this website that theoretically looks

1015
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:20,640
like it's run by american activists

1016
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:25,679
in reality run by a russian contractor

1017
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:27,200
here again here's our state media

1018
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:30,320
outlets as they appear on facebook

1019
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:32,480
the top one is rt arabic the second is

1020
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:34,320
rt espanol

1021
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:36,960
third is rt english just the kind of

1022
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:38,559
main property

1023
00:33:38,559 --> 00:33:40,080
interestingly you do see you know you

1024
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:41,840
can kind of first you'll notice it's a

1025
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:44,000
fraction of the size of the 100 and

1026
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,240
you know 100 and something million that

1027
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:47,919
we see from the chinese pages

1028
00:33:47,919 --> 00:33:49,760
but interestingly actually the

1029
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:52,320
engagement on the russian sites

1030
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:54,159
is an order of magnitude higher than the

1031
00:33:54,159 --> 00:33:56,159
engagement on the chinese sites

1032
00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:59,440
and so on the chinese facebook pages

1033
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:01,600
what we see from rt is they have far

1034
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,039
more engaged audiences

1035
00:34:03,039 --> 00:34:05,279
particularly on youtube and there's this

1036
00:34:05,279 --> 00:34:07,200
range of subsidiaries that are

1037
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:09,520
really dedicated to using social media

1038
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:11,599
to reach very specific

1039
00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:14,000
regional ideological and demographic

1040
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:14,960
subsets

1041
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,800
so in the now for example the fourth one

1042
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:18,800
on that list really prioritizes video

1043
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:19,679
creation

1044
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:22,079
for young millennials particularly on

1045
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:23,280
the left

1046
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:25,040
and so they produce content that

1047
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:26,560
regularly goes viral

1048
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:29,359
within those targeted audiences this is

1049
00:34:29,359 --> 00:34:30,879
the idea of

1050
00:34:30,879 --> 00:34:33,918
you don't want to look at a metric just

1051
00:34:33,918 --> 00:34:35,280
like follower count

1052
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:37,040
and assume that it's having significant

1053
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:38,639
impact you really have to do

1054
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:40,960
a lot more research into understanding

1055
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:42,560
is the content resonating

1056
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:44,960
within the target sphere and is the

1057
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:46,239
target sphere

1058
00:34:46,239 --> 00:34:48,079
then in turn sharing out to their own

1059
00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:49,359
communities because

1060
00:34:49,359 --> 00:34:50,879
that's how the that's how the

1061
00:34:50,879 --> 00:34:52,480
information is actually

1062
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:55,359
effectively spread

1063
00:34:55,918 --> 00:34:58,480
so on the covert side of social media

1064
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:00,720
there's the internet research agency

1065
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:03,359
so russia uses the plausible deniability

1066
00:35:03,359 --> 00:35:04,880
of contractor agencies

1067
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:08,160
organizations like the ira which are not

1068
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:08,800
directly

1069
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:11,359
connected to the russian government they

1070
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:13,040
afford a kind of

1071
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:14,800
plausible deniability well we didn't

1072
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:15,839
tell them to do that they're just

1073
00:35:15,839 --> 00:35:18,720
patriotic trolls who go out and do it

1074
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:21,760
the ira is a fascinating organization so

1075
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:25,760
this is purely social first content

1076
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:29,359
the social media environment

1077
00:35:29,359 --> 00:35:31,200
lends itself to certain formats of

1078
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:33,119
information and

1079
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:35,920
one of the things that we kind of divide

1080
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:37,440
you know divide research along

1081
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:39,839
is narrative propaganda versus memetic

1082
00:35:39,839 --> 00:35:41,040
propaganda

1083
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:44,079
is it a is it information that requires

1084
00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:46,160
someone to sit and read which is less

1085
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:47,280
frequently shared

1086
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:48,960
or is it something like a meme where you

1087
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:50,560
can kind of capture the essence

1088
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:52,720
in about you know six words it makes

1089
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:54,240
somebody feel a certain way and they

1090
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:55,599
share it along because they think it's

1091
00:35:55,599 --> 00:35:56,960
funny or ironic

1092
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:58,640
or it really kind of summarizes how they

1093
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:00,800
feel about a particular issue

1094
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:04,240
so here we see again

1095
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:07,599
900 000 engagements 988 000 engagements

1096
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:11,200
on the yosemite sam meme and we see 720

1097
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:12,160
000 engagements

1098
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:15,200
on the meme of the veteran and what's

1099
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:16,560
interesting about this is as you look at

1100
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:18,160
the content

1101
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:20,640
you see that it's very identity focused

1102
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:22,560
so it's really trying to entrench people

1103
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:23,359
into

1104
00:36:23,359 --> 00:36:25,760
a particular um you know they have a

1105
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:27,280
particular political opinion

1106
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:29,280
that they hold as a kind of deeply held

1107
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:31,440
belief and this really kind of

1108
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:33,599
the content is consistently reinforcing

1109
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:35,680
that identity reinforcing that belief

1110
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:37,359
and so when you share it you're sort of

1111
00:36:37,359 --> 00:36:39,520
signaling membership in that group

1112
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:41,520
and one of the ways that the ira

1113
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:43,760
operated was by segmenting american

1114
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:44,480
society

1115
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:47,119
into these groups and creating content

1116
00:36:47,119 --> 00:36:48,079
both on the left

1117
00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:50,880
and on the right so with the chinese

1118
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:52,560
content you see persuasion

1119
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:53,839
you know trying to tell the story of

1120
00:36:53,839 --> 00:36:56,480
china and how good china is for the

1121
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:57,119
world

1122
00:36:57,119 --> 00:36:58,960
you don't see that happening in the

1123
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:01,200
russian subversive propaganda

1124
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:03,119
or in the russian memes what you see

1125
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:04,400
instead is

1126
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:06,839
simply dividing the society of the

1127
00:37:06,839 --> 00:37:08,400
adversary

1128
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:10,960
through this process of entrenchment and

1129
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:12,800
exploiting existing existing social

1130
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:13,359
fissures

1131
00:37:13,359 --> 00:37:15,040
so there's very different motivations

1132
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:17,520
very different ways of carrying it out

1133
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:19,599
but ultimately still using the social

1134
00:37:19,599 --> 00:37:21,040
ecosystem to try to achieve this

1135
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:23,839
particular aim

1136
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:29,280
but i want to get into beyond just the

1137
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:31,599
memes and the propaganda

1138
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:34,800
the agent of influence model that we see

1139
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:36,800
happening here as well

1140
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:39,200
so when you follow an internet research

1141
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:40,160
agency page

1142
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:41,839
and maybe you leave a comment you know

1143
00:37:41,839 --> 00:37:45,280
like this meme comment on the meme

1144
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:47,200
what you've just done there is you've

1145
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:49,839
given the person operating the page

1146
00:37:49,839 --> 00:37:51,920
an indication that you're sympathetic to

1147
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:53,680
that point of view

1148
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:56,160
and so what we saw as we did the

1149
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:56,960
research

1150
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:58,240
you know i led one of the teams doing

1151
00:37:58,240 --> 00:37:59,599
the senate intelligence committee

1152
00:37:59,599 --> 00:38:00,720
research into the

1153
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:02,839
operation targeting the us from to

1154
00:38:02,839 --> 00:38:04,240
2014-2016

1155
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:07,119
what we saw over and over and over again

1156
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:08,400
were these kind of

1157
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:11,680
attempts to recruit so

1158
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:14,160
how can they turn their audience into

1159
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:15,599
active participants

1160
00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:19,040
on winning participants in the operation

1161
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:22,960
and so you see this constant outreach

1162
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:25,040
uh ways you know you see them really

1163
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:26,880
trying to develop a much deeper

1164
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:28,560
relationship with the audience

1165
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:30,640
than you would see from a normal

1166
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:32,480
broadcast type or even social media

1167
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:33,839
manipulation operation

1168
00:38:33,839 --> 00:38:36,240
from any other adversary so this kind of

1169
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:37,760
behavior is very unique

1170
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:40,240
this is how you modernize that process

1171
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:41,680
of agents of influence

1172
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:43,760
and what the mueller investigation team

1173
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:45,280
had also

1174
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:47,520
were the direct messages and what you

1175
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:48,880
see in the direct messages

1176
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:51,359
is the operators of the pages offering

1177
00:38:51,359 --> 00:38:53,040
financial resources and offering

1178
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:54,400
logistical support

1179
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:56,480
and really working to infiltrate the

1180
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:58,720
communities that they're targeting

1181
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:01,119
because if you can turn people into

1182
00:39:01,119 --> 00:39:03,520
either unwitting content amplifiers

1183
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:05,440
uh or people who will actually go out

1184
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:06,960
and mobilize in the streets

1185
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:09,839
in support of an idea that's a very

1186
00:39:09,839 --> 00:39:11,119
powerful tool

1187
00:39:11,119 --> 00:39:13,440
and that's the kind of thing that is

1188
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:14,960
increasingly hard to find

1189
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:17,200
you don't see those signals of that

1190
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:18,800
aspect of the operation

1191
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:20,160
when you're just looking at the memes or

1192
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:21,920
looking at the engagement that's the

1193
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:23,280
kind of thing that's happening behind

1194
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:24,079
the scenes

1195
00:39:24,079 --> 00:39:25,760
that really were at this point reliant

1196
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:27,920
on platform companies that have

1197
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:29,440
visibility into those messages

1198
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:32,160
or other forms of outside investigation

1199
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:34,400
to try to provide leads to indicate

1200
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:35,920
that maybe this page isn't really what

1201
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:38,400
it seems

1202
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:42,000
and then there is the kind of way that

1203
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,440
this intersects with

1204
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:46,480
russian military intelligence so

1205
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:48,720
the internet research agency operation

1206
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:49,599
that's the kind of

1207
00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:53,200
um social societal agent of influence

1208
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:54,720
model that's happening

1209
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:57,040
concurrently with a hack and leak

1210
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:58,079
operation

1211
00:39:58,079 --> 00:39:59,359
that's been carried out by russian

1212
00:39:59,359 --> 00:40:01,440
military intelligence and i want to

1213
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:03,280
describe a little bit about how the gru

1214
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:04,319
operated

1215
00:40:04,319 --> 00:40:06,720
both on social platforms in agents of

1216
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:08,560
influence models and then in the hack

1217
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:11,280
and leak the network infiltration piece

1218
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:15,920
so excuse me

1219
00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:24,480
so apt-28 fancy bear beginning in

1220
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:28,240
2012 the gru begins its own efforts

1221
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:30,960
to create fake facebook pages and groups

1222
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:31,440
and

1223
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:34,640
most of them were set up as the kind of

1224
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:36,160
dark propaganda pages

1225
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:38,480
a lot of fake media a lot of fake think

1226
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:39,280
tanks

1227
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:41,520
um they create these pages on facebook

1228
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:42,880
so this is several years before the

1229
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:44,160
official creation of the internet

1230
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:45,359
research agency

1231
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:47,119
russian military intelligence is trying

1232
00:40:47,119 --> 00:40:49,440
out this tactic

1233
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:51,520
and what they do in the in the network

1234
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:52,480
graph

1235
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:55,119
each green dot is a fake persona and

1236
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:56,560
each pink dot

1237
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:58,560
is a place where they successfully

1238
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:00,319
placed content

1239
00:41:00,319 --> 00:41:03,680
so the green fake personas are all set

1240
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:04,720
up as journalists

1241
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:07,040
they all have facebook profiles they all

1242
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:09,359
have networks of fans on twitter who are

1243
00:41:09,359 --> 00:41:11,280
amplifying their content

1244
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:13,040
and what they're doing is they're

1245
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:15,359
writing articles mostly geopolitically

1246
00:41:15,359 --> 00:41:16,640
focused in the early days of the

1247
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:17,440
operation

1248
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:19,680
and they're sharing their content to

1249
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:20,720
their own sites where they're

1250
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:22,880
purportedly journalists for so inside

1251
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:24,160
syria media center

1252
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:26,079
and these front media properties that

1253
00:41:26,079 --> 00:41:27,599
russia has set up

1254
00:41:27,599 --> 00:41:29,920
but then using the credential of being

1255
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:32,160
inside syria media center reporters

1256
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:35,040
they in turn share the content to uh to

1257
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:36,400
western blogs

1258
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:38,640
and to regional blogs that have a wider

1259
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:40,319
audience this is how they're kind of

1260
00:41:40,319 --> 00:41:41,680
doing this process of narrative

1261
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:43,599
laundering

1262
00:41:43,599 --> 00:41:46,400
the gru did not have very much success

1263
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:48,000
in using this kind of narrative

1264
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,560
social media operation and i think this

1265
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:52,079
is why you see the internet research

1266
00:41:52,079 --> 00:41:53,760
agency emerge with that kind of meme

1267
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:56,079
first social first dynamic

1268
00:41:56,079 --> 00:41:58,319
but what was interesting about the gru

1269
00:41:58,319 --> 00:41:59,680
attempt

1270
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:02,000
is that they are out there again trying

1271
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,800
to do this initial emergence of

1272
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:06,480
this sort of full spectrum information

1273
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:08,800
operation

1274
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:10,319
but then the one thing that they have

1275
00:42:10,319 --> 00:42:11,839
that none of the other actors that we've

1276
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:12,560
discussed

1277
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:15,200
have as far as this you know

1278
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:17,040
demonstrable

1279
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:18,640
commitment to full spectrum information

1280
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:21,200
operations is they also go out and hack

1281
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:24,079
and so the this is where information

1282
00:42:24,079 --> 00:42:26,000
operations intersect with infosec very

1283
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:26,800
directly

1284
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:29,200
so the hack and leak operations provide

1285
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:30,000
extraordinary

1286
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
collateral for driving the influence

1287
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,480
operations the gru goes and they hack

1288
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:38,000
a public official public agency

1289
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,160
they take that collateral and then that

1290
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:42,560
in turn is transmitted to

1291
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:45,119
their own personas their own agents of

1292
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:46,480
influence their kind of online fake

1293
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:47,280
personas

1294
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:49,280
who try to communicate it to journalists

1295
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:50,640
this is the guccifer model of

1296
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:53,119
distributing the podesta emails

1297
00:42:53,119 --> 00:42:55,520
then they also the internet research

1298
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:56,480
agency

1299
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:58,240
picks up the content begins to turn it

1300
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:00,480
into memes driving news cycles

1301
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:01,440
domestically and

1302
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:04,079
and facilitating sharing within american

1303
00:43:04,079 --> 00:43:05,200
audiences

1304
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:07,280
and then you have rt and sputnik and the

1305
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:09,119
overt propaganda properties

1306
00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:12,000
that begin to report on the substance of

1307
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:12,800
the hack

1308
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:15,359
while denying who the hacker actually

1309
00:43:15,359 --> 00:43:16,480
was

1310
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:19,520
and so you see this process by which

1311
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:21,119
the entirety of all the kind of

1312
00:43:21,119 --> 00:43:23,440
information manipulation tools

1313
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:26,800
are put to use simultaneously in service

1314
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:27,599
to

1315
00:43:27,599 --> 00:43:30,000
one operation one information operation

1316
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,680
and that's how you use the system

1317
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:33,460
kind of most effectively

1318
00:43:33,460 --> 00:43:34,880
[Music]

1319
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:38,240
so again the documents obtained in the

1320
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:40,079
hack are distributed across the entire

1321
00:43:40,079 --> 00:43:42,960
spectrum of broadcast and social media

1322
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:44,640
you see the subversive personas and

1323
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:46,079
agents of influence engage with the

1324
00:43:46,079 --> 00:43:47,440
journalists

1325
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:49,040
they pass them leaked materials which

1326
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:50,640
are then amplified by the targeted

1327
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:52,079
country's own material

1328
00:43:52,079 --> 00:43:55,119
the stories trend on social and then

1329
00:43:55,119 --> 00:43:58,480
the you know in this case russia's own

1330
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:00,000
propaganda apparatus

1331
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,599
uh begins to tell the story and to

1332
00:44:01,599 --> 00:44:03,280
report on it on their own

1333
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:04,960
media and social media properties as

1334
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:07,119
well

1335
00:44:07,599 --> 00:44:10,079
so to summarize well-resourced state

1336
00:44:10,079 --> 00:44:11,119
adversaries will use

1337
00:44:11,119 --> 00:44:12,560
all the means at their disposal to

1338
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:14,160
execute information operations

1339
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:17,440
in service to geopolitical goals and

1340
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:19,040
in the case of russia in particular what

1341
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:20,960
we see is the exploitation of divisions

1342
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:22,319
in our society

1343
00:44:22,319 --> 00:44:24,319
using vulnerabilities in our information

1344
00:44:24,319 --> 00:44:26,800
ecosystem so because of the way

1345
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:29,040
the social information ecosystem that

1346
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:31,440
sort of peer-to-peer transmission

1347
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:34,160
mechanism works the difficulty of

1348
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:35,280
finding

1349
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:37,359
agents of influence infiltrating groups

1350
00:44:37,359 --> 00:44:39,680
but the ease with which it can be done

1351
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:42,240
really lends itself to these operations

1352
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:43,280
not only

1353
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:45,040
continuing as they are but actually kind

1354
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:46,800
of increasing in potency

1355
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:49,200
as more and more actors realize that

1356
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:51,599
this is a thing that can be done

1357
00:44:51,599 --> 00:44:53,119
so one question that's highly relevant

1358
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:54,560
right now is what does this mean for the

1359
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:56,050
us 2020 election

1360
00:44:56,050 --> 00:44:57,200
[Music]

1361
00:44:57,200 --> 00:45:00,240
so i think there are four kind of

1362
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:02,160
significant things that we may see over

1363
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:03,359
the next few months

1364
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:05,040
two of which are specifically related to

1365
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:06,560
that blend between infosec and

1366
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:08,480
information operations

1367
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:11,599
um so again hack and leak there is you

1368
00:45:11,599 --> 00:45:12,240
know

1369
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:14,319
it is inherently newsworthy it will get

1370
00:45:14,319 --> 00:45:16,160
coverage the content will get pick up

1371
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:18,160
it's a very effective tactic

1372
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:20,319
and it really does change press cycles

1373
00:45:20,319 --> 00:45:22,720
during campaigns

1374
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:24,960
then there's the risk of hacked voting

1375
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:26,800
machines uh you know there's indications

1376
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:28,240
from 2016 that that

1377
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:30,480
did happen that they that that various

1378
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:32,240
actors tried to do it

1379
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:34,880
even more than you know than we

1380
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:36,079
previously thought

1381
00:45:36,079 --> 00:45:38,319
even if not a single vote is changed

1382
00:45:38,319 --> 00:45:39,839
releasing the information

1383
00:45:39,839 --> 00:45:41,280
claiming that you have successfully

1384
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:44,880
hacked the machine will cause havoc

1385
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:45,839
then then there's what i've been

1386
00:45:45,839 --> 00:45:47,520
describing the infiltration of groups

1387
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:49,520
and the amplification of narratives

1388
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:51,920
again what we're starting to see more

1389
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:52,640
and more

1390
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:55,359
is sophisticated information operation

1391
00:45:55,359 --> 00:45:56,240
actors

1392
00:45:56,240 --> 00:45:58,960
hiring locals or paying on winning

1393
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:00,400
locals to

1394
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:03,680
serve as conduits for for their content

1395
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:05,520
or what they'll do is they'll simply

1396
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:07,280
amplify sensational narratives that are

1397
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:08,960
already trending on twitter

1398
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:12,240
as political ideologues domestically use

1399
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:14,079
the same kind of gaming of algorithms to

1400
00:46:14,079 --> 00:46:15,520
try to get their stuff trending

1401
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:16,880
you can just kind of give it an extra

1402
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:19,200
boost

1403
00:46:19,599 --> 00:46:20,960
but ultimately the goal will be to

1404
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:23,359
undermine confidence in the legitimacy

1405
00:46:23,359 --> 00:46:26,000
of the election

1406
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:27,760
so when we talk about information

1407
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:30,000
operations uh it's important to note

1408
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,160
that these personas and their materials

1409
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:35,200
resonate because of underlying existing

1410
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:36,720
societal divides

1411
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:38,319
because of legit like legitimate

1412
00:46:38,319 --> 00:46:40,480
grievances and polarization

1413
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:42,319
and because of low levels of trust in

1414
00:46:42,319 --> 00:46:43,680
institutions and government

1415
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:47,920
so you can't hack a social system

1416
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:50,319
if the social system is resistant to the

1417
00:46:50,319 --> 00:46:50,960
attack

1418
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:53,119
and unfortunately ours at this point

1419
00:46:53,119 --> 00:46:54,560
really is not

1420
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:57,280
so this page here um was one that i

1421
00:46:57,280 --> 00:46:58,880
screenshotted from

1422
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:01,440
an activist page on facebook and at the

1423
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:03,440
time this was 20 2018.

1424
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:05,599
uh i wondered if he was somehow

1425
00:47:05,599 --> 00:47:07,440
connected to the ira because

1426
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:10,240
40 of the content on the page was ira

1427
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:12,000
memes so i thought perhaps this was

1428
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
another ira page

1429
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:15,920
but it turned out no it was you know as

1430
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:17,760
a real person and it was just that the

1431
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:20,480
messages really resonated

1432
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:23,520
so as long as propaganda has existed you

1433
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:25,599
know people have debated its impact

1434
00:47:25,599 --> 00:47:28,640
and we know that people form opinions

1435
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:29,920
and internalize memes

1436
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:32,079
based on repetition particularly if they

1437
00:47:32,079 --> 00:47:33,599
trust the source

1438
00:47:33,599 --> 00:47:35,599
we know that false stories you know

1439
00:47:35,599 --> 00:47:37,200
things like operation

1440
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:39,599
denver or sometimes operation infection

1441
00:47:39,599 --> 00:47:42,079
the idea that the cia created aids

1442
00:47:42,079 --> 00:47:44,400
those false stories are internalized by

1443
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:46,960
real people they continue to spread

1444
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:50,079
long after the operation itself is

1445
00:47:50,079 --> 00:47:51,839
you know the active operations have

1446
00:47:51,839 --> 00:47:53,440
ceased so

1447
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:55,280
we also know that malign actors continue

1448
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:57,359
to prioritize investment in propaganda

1449
00:47:57,359 --> 00:47:58,800
and state media

1450
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:00,800
but there's a lot for us kind of

1451
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:02,160
remaining to study

1452
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:05,119
so in the era of social media we are

1453
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:05,520
more

1454
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:07,839
instrumented than ever before we can

1455
00:48:07,839 --> 00:48:09,680
treat engagement data

1456
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:11,760
as a kind of proxy you know for seeing

1457
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:13,599
how far something spreads

1458
00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:15,760
we can quantify how much reach it gets

1459
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:17,200
we can quantify

1460
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:19,359
how many likes it gets versus angry

1461
00:48:19,359 --> 00:48:20,480
faces

1462
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:23,200
where we can see how people are reacting

1463
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:24,160
to this stuff

1464
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:26,079
but we can't really see is whether it

1465
00:48:26,079 --> 00:48:27,680
changed hearts or minds

1466
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:29,359
we can tell you that it jumped from

1467
00:48:29,359 --> 00:48:31,440
community x into community y

1468
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:33,040
we can map a lot of that stuff out and

1469
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:35,359
that's what we're doing at sio every day

1470
00:48:35,359 --> 00:48:37,440
but it's extremely difficult to

1471
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:38,960
understand the impact

1472
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:42,240
of these campaigns writ large and that's

1473
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:43,520
one of the things that's really kind of

1474
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:45,320
an ongoing area of research

1475
00:48:45,320 --> 00:48:47,440
[Music]

1476
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:49,599
so while i've focused on state actors

1477
00:48:49,599 --> 00:48:51,359
hacking public opinion on political

1478
00:48:51,359 --> 00:48:52,480
topics

1479
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:55,040
um the threat is actually broader so if

1480
00:48:55,040 --> 00:48:56,240
you're a cso

1481
00:48:56,240 --> 00:48:58,559
in an agricultural company an extractive

1482
00:48:58,559 --> 00:48:59,359
industry

1483
00:48:59,359 --> 00:49:01,200
multinational company with global lines

1484
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:02,400
of business that are

1485
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:04,000
you know of interest to uh you know if

1486
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:05,839
you're competing with other governments

1487
00:49:05,839 --> 00:49:07,359
other countries

1488
00:49:07,359 --> 00:49:08,960
companies from those countries

1489
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:11,040
reputational attacks on companies are

1490
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:13,760
just as easy to execute

1491
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:16,400
these the house committee on science and

1492
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:17,440
technology

1493
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:19,440
has a report about russian bots talking

1494
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:20,559
about fracking and

1495
00:49:20,559 --> 00:49:23,760
monsanto for example so there's

1496
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:27,200
ways in which you can see those same

1497
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:29,599
models applied to attack the reputations

1498
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:32,319
of businesses online as well

1499
00:49:32,319 --> 00:49:34,079
companies that take a strong stand on

1500
00:49:34,079 --> 00:49:36,079
divisive social issues

1501
00:49:36,079 --> 00:49:37,839
may also find themselves embroiled in

1502
00:49:37,839 --> 00:49:39,599
social media chatter that isn't

1503
00:49:39,599 --> 00:49:41,440
necessarily what it seems to be

1504
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:44,319
because again you can have amplification

1505
00:49:44,319 --> 00:49:44,880
of those

1506
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:46,480
tensions and of the kind of fraud

1507
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:48,559
conversations on social media

1508
00:49:48,559 --> 00:49:50,079
by additional outsiders who come to

1509
00:49:50,079 --> 00:49:51,760
participate because they see it as a

1510
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:52,880
great way

1511
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:56,960
to erode social cohesion

1512
00:49:56,960 --> 00:49:58,400
very few companies will know where in

1513
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:00,319
the org chart to put responsibility for

1514
00:50:00,319 --> 00:50:02,480
understanding those kinds of activities

1515
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:04,079
um you know just because a lot of

1516
00:50:04,079 --> 00:50:05,359
mentions of your brand are happening

1517
00:50:05,359 --> 00:50:06,559
that doesn't necessarily mean that

1518
00:50:06,559 --> 00:50:07,040
they're

1519
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:09,680
authentic or inauthentic so this really

1520
00:50:09,680 --> 00:50:11,200
kind of falls to the cso at this point

1521
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:12,559
to try to understand

1522
00:50:12,559 --> 00:50:13,839
when these attacks are focused on

1523
00:50:13,839 --> 00:50:16,079
corporations how they should respond

1524
00:50:16,079 --> 00:50:19,359
how they should think about them but the

1525
00:50:19,359 --> 00:50:21,839
question of how to address malign actors

1526
00:50:21,839 --> 00:50:23,599
hacking public opinion isn't purely

1527
00:50:23,599 --> 00:50:25,920
technical and it's certainly not limited

1528
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:27,520
to social media

1529
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:30,720
the agents of influence models uh the

1530
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:31,920
hack and leak kind of network

1531
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:34,000
infiltration in service to information

1532
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:35,280
operations

1533
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:37,760
these are things where that's not just a

1534
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:39,680
social network analysis problem

1535
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:41,359
so we need to be doing more red teaming

1536
00:50:41,359 --> 00:50:43,119
we need to be thinking about

1537
00:50:43,119 --> 00:50:46,160
social and media ecosystem as a system

1538
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:47,839
proactively envisioning what kinds of

1539
00:50:47,839 --> 00:50:50,160
manipulation are possible

1540
00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:52,079
with each emergent app each new feature

1541
00:50:52,079 --> 00:50:53,359
each new policy

1542
00:50:53,359 --> 00:50:55,119
the rules of the game change slightly

1543
00:50:55,119 --> 00:50:56,640
and we need to be thinking proactively

1544
00:50:56,640 --> 00:50:58,480
about how those changes

1545
00:50:58,480 --> 00:50:59,760
impact the kinds of information

1546
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:02,640
operations that we're likely to see next

1547
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:05,119
so we need to increase communication

1548
00:51:05,119 --> 00:51:05,760
between

1549
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:07,440
infosec professionals and information

1550
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:08,960
operations researchers

1551
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:10,400
with the goal of developing a better

1552
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:12,400
understanding of how social network

1553
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:13,680
manipulation

1554
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:15,839
intersects with network infiltration in

1555
00:51:15,839 --> 00:51:17,359
service to

1556
00:51:17,359 --> 00:51:20,640
predicting and mitigating these attacks

1557
00:51:20,640 --> 00:51:23,040
so thanks for listening and thank you to

1558
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:24,960
the black hat organizers for having me

1559
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:27,240
and i look forward to taking your

1560
00:51:27,240 --> 00:51:30,240
questions
