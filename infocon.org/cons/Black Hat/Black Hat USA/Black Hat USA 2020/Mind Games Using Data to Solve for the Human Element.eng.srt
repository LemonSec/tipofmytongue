1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
hi my name is masha sedova

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,359
and today i'm going to be talking to you

3
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:07,520
about mind games how we can use data to

4
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:09,120
solve for the human element

5
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:10,400
before we get started i'd like to tell

6
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:11,759
you just a little bit about myself and

7
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:13,280
how i got to be here

8
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:16,079
i started my 16-year career so far in

9
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:19,039
the security space as a defense analyst

10
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:21,600
focusing on the russian cyber threat

11
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:22,320
from there

12
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,640
i had the opportunity to start and run

13
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:25,760
the security

14
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:27,680
engagement team at salesforce which i

15
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:29,279
did for about five years

16
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:31,920
and in that capacity i got to focus on

17
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:33,440
all the elements of human risk in that

18
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:34,559
organization

19
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:36,880
and getting people to buy in to more

20
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:39,120
secure outcomes and behaviors

21
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,680
my love of the human element then took

22
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:43,520
me to starting elevate security which i

23
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:46,000
did in early 2017

24
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,399
and today elevate security is the

25
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:50,879
leading human risk management platform

26
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:52,640
and throughout my career what i have

27
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:54,480
been really focusing on

28
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:58,000
is the role of the human being in our

29
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,280
defense as well as its weakness

30
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:04,080
in our in securing of our organization

31
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:05,040
and one of the things that i have

32
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,880
noticed time and time again

33
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:10,000
is that often we make our employees do

34
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:10,720
security

35
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:12,000
and i've been really obsessed with the

36
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,360
question of what would it look like if

37
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:15,200
employees wanted to do security instead

38
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,479
of have to

39
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:19,520
and in that question that i i got the

40
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:20,720
chance to explore

41
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:22,320
concepts outside of security like

42
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:23,759
behavioral science and positive

43
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:25,040
psychology

44
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:26,960
that really study how and why we make

45
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:28,560
decisions the way we do

46
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,159
and for the last 10 years i've been

47
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:31,520
knitting together the fields of

48
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:32,720
behavioral psychology

49
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:35,759
and cyber security to create more robust

50
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:36,479
defenses

51
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:38,799
as it relates to the human element so

52
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:39,600
today

53
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,119
i want to tell you a little bit about

54
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:43,040
what i have noticed in my career

55
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:46,479
tackling this problem what i have seen

56
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:47,920
and what i have come to believe is that

57
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,600
human risk is one of the largest

58
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,840
unsolved problems in security

59
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,439
let me tell you a little bit about why i

60
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:54,960
think that is

61
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,799
if you opened up the verizon data breach

62
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:58,560
report this year

63
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,280
you would find that the human element or

64
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,240
human risks

65
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:06,320
associated with human action

66
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:09,598
have the top reason or the top reasons

67
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:10,318
why

68
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:12,560
breaches are successful whether or not

69
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,160
it is phishing

70
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:17,599
credential stealing abuse either

71
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:19,200
privileged abuse intentional or

72
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,640
unintentional through errors

73
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:23,840
or mishandling of sensitive information

74
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:26,959
time and time again it is human

75
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:30,239
errors intentional or otherwise

76
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:32,080
that continue to create a repeated

77
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:34,319
vulnerability in our organization

78
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:36,720
and this year is no exception if you

79
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:37,440
take a look at

80
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,120
any of the last five years you'll find

81
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,599
that phishing and credential stealing

82
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:44,800
tends to be the top three four

83
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,280
five issues time and time again for what

84
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,840
we're trying to tackle as a security

85
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,160
industry

86
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,239
and why do we think this is is it

87
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:53,519
because we haven't invested enough

88
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:54,720
technology

89
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,959
is it because we haven't explored this

90
00:02:56,959 --> 00:02:59,360
problem as effectively

91
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:02,640
i think it is because human risk is the

92
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:03,280
largest

93
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,680
unquestioned and unexplored problem in

94
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,680
the security space

95
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:10,720
i say this because

96
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,319
if you were to go into almost any

97
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:14,720
organization today you will find

98
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:17,040
the same approach to this problem and

99
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,879
that is our employees

100
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:21,040
taking a one-size-fits-annual training

101
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,800
one-size-fits-all annual security

102
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:23,280
training

103
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,519
that they mute skip through to the end

104
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:27,519
and brute force quiz question

105
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:30,080
and this is showing to be completely

106
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,360
ineffective

107
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,680
as it relates to addressing this

108
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,760
pervasive and ubiquitous problem

109
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,440
and the approaches that we have set out

110
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,120
for our employees today

111
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,440
are really compliance oriented hard to

112
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,400
measure their impact

113
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,040
and truly a one-size-fits-all approach

114
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,560
today i want to tell you a little bit

115
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,200
about

116
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,120
a new way we can tackle this pervasive

117
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,239
problem

118
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:52,319
and how we can use the data that we have

119
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:54,480
available to us in our organization

120
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:57,360
to understand the efficacy of accepted

121
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,720
best practices

122
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,720
understand where we can look for human

123
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,560
risk in our organization

124
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:05,040
and explore a variety of effective

125
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,400
remediation techniques

126
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,879
beyond what we consider to be best

127
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:10,879
practices today

128
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:13,360
so to get us started i want to tell you

129
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,799
about a piece of research that i

130
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:16,560
came across that i found incredibly

131
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:19,199
impactful and well researched

132
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:21,199
so one of the things that we do in our

133
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:23,919
society and our security practices today

134
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:26,720
is a concept called mock fishing so what

135
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:27,199
this

136
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:30,639
research did was they found a group

137
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:33,759
of 1500 employees that they sent three

138
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:35,680
targeted spear phishing emails to them

139
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,680
over the course of several months

140
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:40,880
and these spear phishing emails were

141
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,560
claiming to have relevant information

142
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,960
for the employees and the idea of this

143
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,400
particular exercise

144
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,639
was that if the user clicked on the

145
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:50,400
spear phishing email they were provided

146
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,160
a training immediately following

147
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,960
their mistake and if they didn't they

148
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:57,600
would just be notified

149
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,120
they would they wouldn't be notified at

150
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,199
all they would they were hoping to see

151
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:03,280
that if a person received something like

152
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:04,880
this a phishing email would that what

153
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:05,280
would they

154
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,199
do and they were expecting to see is

155
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:08,479
that one

156
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:10,479
a lower clicking click rate of spear

157
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:11,840
phishing links would happen

158
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,840
because people were given training when

159
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,360
they clicked and two

160
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,120
people were going to increase their

161
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,440
reporting of suspicious emails

162
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,919
perfectly reasonable logical

163
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:23,600
expectations and results in fact

164
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,240
this is what most of our security teams

165
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,199
do right now is

166
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:30,479
in practicing phishing resiliency um

167
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:32,320
this is what the interventions look like

168
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,759
for a group of people

169
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:35,680
who they chose not to give training to

170
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:36,800
to see what would happen with the

171
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,160
control group and they just received a

172
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,199
notification

173
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:41,120
what we see on the left hand side here

174
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,360
say hey that was a phishing email and

175
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,400
you clicked on it

176
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,160
on the right hand side the post

177
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,680
compromise training group received this

178
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,600
training email that said

179
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:52,000
um well this was this this is a spear

180
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,199
fishing this is how you could have

181
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:54,400
identified it

182
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,880
and uh how what are things that you

183
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:59,280
could do to protect your coworkers

184
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,520
and what they found was actually quite

185
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:02,880
surprising

186
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:06,400
first of all they found that employees

187
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,560
actually grouped themselves into cohorts

188
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,560
and many employees either clicked

189
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:13,759
all of the links or none of them at all

190
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:15,919
and what the second thing that they

191
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:17,759
found is that the performance that

192
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:20,880
of um an employee's reaction to the

193
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,000
email on the first

194
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,080
on the first email they received was a

195
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,840
very good predictor

196
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,600
of how they would react to the

197
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,280
subsequent spear phishing emails they

198
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,800
received over the course of the next few

199
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:31,440
months

200
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,120
so if you were likely to click on the

201
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,880
first one you are more likely to click

202
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,560
on all future ones and if you

203
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,160
didn't click the first one you were

204
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,400
likely to not click the future ones

205
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,479
and as for the training they found that

206
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:44,560
the training didn't matter at all

207
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:47,039
they found that when an employee clicked

208
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:48,080
uh and was

209
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,160
and received a training and then

210
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,199
received a future

211
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:53,039
phishing email that whether or not they

212
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:54,479
received the training had no

213
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:57,360
impact on their performance and those

214
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,080
employees that

215
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,560
did receive a training spent a mere few

216
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,000
seconds on the page

217
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,720
indicating that they did not bother

218
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:08,160
reading or ingesting any of the content

219
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:11,759
and what what we took away

220
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:13,120
in reading this research and

221
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:15,360
understanding what was done in the space

222
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,440
was a couple of key questions that we

223
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,759
wanted to analyze a little bit further

224
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:23,199
so the first was if people were

225
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:27,039
likely to click all or none can we find

226
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:28,319
predictors

227
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:30,800
of what kind of cohort you as an

228
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,800
employer are going to fall into

229
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,560
are you going to be a good or bad

230
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,080
security performer

231
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,080
across specific security behaviors like

232
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,599
phishing like reporting

233
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:42,560
like malware infection rates and as far

234
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:42,800
as

235
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,120
training if the training content didn't

236
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,800
matter and people were skipping it

237
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,120
are there more effective ways that we

238
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,240
can

239
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,560
create interventions to improve these

240
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,360
skill sets

241
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,360
and the ability to change these

242
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,039
behaviors of employees

243
00:07:57,039 --> 00:07:59,280
so my team at elevate security and i

244
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,199
decided to tackle these two questions

245
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:02,800
and for the rest of the presentation

246
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,479
i want to tell you about our findings in

247
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:06,479
both of these spaces

248
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:08,960
so let's start off with can we predict

249
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,800
security behaviors

250
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,080
before we get into this i want to give

251
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,520
you a little bit of context around how

252
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:14,639
we did this research

253
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:16,720
and the data sets that we're using to do

254
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,000
this analysis

255
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,680
so the elevated security platform

256
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:22,080
integrates with existing security tools

257
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,000
that organizations have and these

258
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,360
security tools map

259
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,879
back to the security actions of

260
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:29,120
employees so in the case of malware what

261
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,479
we're looking at as

262
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:32,799
did an employee download malware was it

263
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:34,880
executed did it have to be blocked

264
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:37,679
in the case of sensitive data handling

265
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:39,279
were there known violations in this

266
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:41,279
space and did someone

267
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:42,958
email things that they shouldn't have

268
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:44,800
did they upload things that they

269
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:45,760
shouldn't have

270
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,200
and so we're looking at a variety of

271
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,880
different behavior sets and then we take

272
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:49,200
that

273
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:52,560
and map it against hr data set to create

274
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,560
risk mappings and heat maps around

275
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:55,920
what's good and bad

276
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:58,959
is trends in an organization so for this

277
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:00,480
particular study

278
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,800
what we did is we took a look at over a

279
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:03,680
million different

280
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:06,959
behavioral actions done by over 80

281
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:09,519
000 different employees across the world

282
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:12,240
observed over a period time of 18 months

283
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,839
and to the best of my knowledge this is

284
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:16,399
the largest behavioral data set

285
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:19,519
observed around human risk to date

286
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:21,440
so with the type of behavior that we

287
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,720
took a look at

288
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:25,519
you can see on um in front of you is a

289
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:27,279
couple of categories first was training

290
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:28,720
did they take the training was it or

291
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:29,760
they completed it

292
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:33,279
on time or late what kind of training

293
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:34,800
was it was it a computer-based training

294
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,160
or was it immersive

295
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:37,760
we took a look at certain security

296
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,440
actions around phishing both mock

297
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,959
fishing and real-world phishing

298
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:42,640
did an employee open it did they click

299
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:45,200
it do they compromise do they report it

300
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,519
password manager adoption did they are

301
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:48,959
they using an account and are they

302
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:50,160
actively using it

303
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:52,240
and then personalized report scorecards

304
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,000
which i'll talk about a little bit later

305
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
did they receive it and did they open it

306
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
as for as far as hr data set

307
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,920
we took a lot of couple took a look at a

308
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,600
couple of things related to

309
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,360
the employee element how long have they

310
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,959
been the company their tenure

311
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:06,560
what geography were they part of are

312
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:09,760
they part of aipac asia pacific emea

313
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:12,000
europe middle east or the americas with

314
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,240
a particular focus on north america

315
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,000
are they a manager and what kind of

316
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,079
contracting status are they are they

317
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:21,200
full-time or part-time

318
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,519
so the first thing we took a look at the

319
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:25,200
data set was

320
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,760
can we predict good or bad behavior

321
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,040
based on

322
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,800
who you are as an employee your hr data

323
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,079
set and

324
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:34,560
and the first thing we looked into was

325
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,480
password manager use who's most likely

326
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,000
to use a password manager

327
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,440
and so we took this data set and we

328
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,519
created a decision tree

329
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:42,959
and the way you can read this decision

330
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:44,880
tree is we split the data

331
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:47,920
based on the most predictive attributes

332
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:51,200
uh and and ways we can group the data

333
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,040
and everything that falls to the left

334
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,560
answers yes to the question everything

335
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:55,519
that falls to the right

336
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:57,360
answers no to the question so the first

337
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,279
way we split the data is are you outside

338
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:00,000
of the

339
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,160
united states then we split that data

340
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,399
set into are you outside of europe or

341
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:05,839
tenure have you been a company less than

342
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:08,079
two years from there we split that data

343
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:08,959
set into

344
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:11,040
ten year different tenure groupings

345
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,560
based on

346
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,880
pools of of employees and as i was

347
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:15,839
mentioning earlier

348
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:18,160
uh most likely predictors and what we

349
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:18,880
found

350
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:22,560
were two categories the least likely

351
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,240
group to use a password manager and the

352
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,480
most likely to use a password manager

353
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,720
and what we found was that employees in

354
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,320
the asia pacific region

355
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,600
that had been with the company for

356
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,360
longer than 1.3 years

357
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:36,000
were the least likely to adopt and

358
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,160
regularly use a password manager

359
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,320
across our data sets employees in the

360
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,279
united states

361
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:42,880
who were with the company longer than

362
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:45,760
1.3 years were the most likely

363
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:48,560
and we found that geography was a much

364
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:49,519
stronger

365
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:52,000
indicator of likelihood of the use of a

366
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,360
password manager

367
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:56,079
us versus apac in this specific example

368
00:11:56,079 --> 00:11:56,880
and tenure

369
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:59,200
while uh being a bit of a predictor had

370
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,680
only a slight effect on

371
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:04,320
on the ability to divide the group the

372
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:04,720
next

373
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,560
thing that we looked into was phishing

374
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,240
attacks who's most likely to fall for a

375
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:09,360
phishing attack

376
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,200
similarly we created a separate decision

377
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,200
tree and split it on a couple of

378
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,160
different

379
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:16,399
splits the first was what's your tenure

380
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:17,760
in the company have you been here less

381
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,440
than three years

382
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,519
are you full-time and are you located in

383
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:22,639
the united states

384
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:24,240
and then through a couple of attributes

385
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,320
including are you in in or outside of

386
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,200
asia pacific

387
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,120
what's your team size and what's your

388
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,959
tenure and what we found

389
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:32,880
again are two groups that are most

390
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,639
likely to click and least likely to

391
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:35,680
click

392
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:38,880
and what we found is for phishing that

393
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,480
the most likely to click

394
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:43,440
are short tenured contractors who are on

395
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,800
large teams

396
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:47,120
the least likely to click are employees

397
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,720
who are in the united states who have

398
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,240
been with their company

399
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:53,600
more than three years but less than 16.

400
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:56,720
and in this case tenure is a much

401
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:57,600
stronger

402
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,720
indication of resiliency to phishing

403
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,399
than any other the uh

404
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:04,079
other attributes what's really

405
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:06,320
fascinating is that

406
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,079
the length of time if you're in the

407
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:09,920
company less than three years

408
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:13,760
or more than 16 have equal amounts of

409
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:14,240
risk

410
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:17,279
for your for your organization so that's

411
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:18,959
based on hr data

412
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:21,440
next question we wanted to ask was are

413
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,680
there behavioral attributes

414
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,360
that an employee exhibits that will

415
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,760
allow us to predict

416
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,519
whether or not they're going to be a

417
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:31,440
good or bad security performers

418
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:35,040
and and one of the things that we had a

419
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,560
lot of data sets around was

420
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:39,360
trainings completed as an employee when

421
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,199
you're assigned a training

422
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:44,240
how um how responsive are you do you

423
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,320
complete your security trainings on time

424
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,399
or do you complete it late and so we

425
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:50,000
took a look at everyone who has

426
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,920
regularly completed their trainings on

427
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,519
time and we found

428
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:56,000
that on average their phishing detection

429
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,240
rate was 91 percent which means

430
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:00,240
that they had an average clicking rate

431
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,519
on phishing attacks

432
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:04,480
at about nine percent they reported

433
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:05,360
phishing attacks

434
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:09,360
about 48 of the time now in comparison

435
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,199
across all of our companies that we

436
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:13,199
looked at and all of the employees

437
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:15,440
if you complete a training late you

438
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:16,480
performed worse

439
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,880
on both detection of phishing attacks

440
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:19,680
and

441
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:22,000
detect and reporting attacks so this is

442
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,440
not a question about knowledge

443
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,279
this is a quote because both groups

444
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:26,959
actually completed the training

445
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:30,000
it's a reflection on how

446
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,079
important do i think security is is it

447
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:33,440
worth my time

448
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,760
will i bother to to do it before the

449
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,680
deadline or will i need to be nagged to

450
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:38,320
do it

451
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:41,760
and so the delta in

452
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,839
there is a there is a clear delta it is

453
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:45,120
not a huge number

454
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,920
two percent and six percent um but it

455
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,440
does clearly show

456
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,440
that if you are late on training you

457
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,440
actually do perform worse on fishing

458
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:56,800
and not worse on reporting and by itself

459
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:59,440
this might be only a small indicator

460
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,240
predictor

461
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,160
but if you take it in connection with

462
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:04,320
the other attributes that we looked at

463
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,959
for example your region or your tenure

464
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:08,959
you can find that these there are more

465
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:11,279
common groupings of people so if we take

466
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:12,160
a set of employees

467
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:14,320
who are new to the company late on

468
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,079
training and located

469
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:17,760
outside of the united states you're

470
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:20,399
going to see much higher

471
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:22,240
clicking rates and much lower reporting

472
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:24,320
rates

473
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:28,000
so now that we've identified groups of

474
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
stragglers around behaviors and ways

475
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,440
that we can predict these kinds

476
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:35,199
of good and bad approaches to security

477
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:37,199
the next question is well what do we do

478
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:39,440
about it how do we design more

479
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,199
effective interventions for our

480
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:42,639
employees

481
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:44,399
if we take a look back to the study that

482
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:46,959
we started this presentation with

483
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:48,639
the approach that we did for an

484
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:50,800
intervention was training

485
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:53,199
so i clicked on the link and i received

486
00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:54,079
a training

487
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:57,040
but what we found in that study was that

488
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,320
employees did not

489
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,560
spend the time consuming the training

490
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,639
and they did not bother

491
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:06,320
to apply the training and subsequent

492
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:08,800
phishing emails that they were receiving

493
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:09,920
so

494
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,920
the thing that training tries to tackle

495
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:13,839
for us is knowledge

496
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:15,600
it is we assume as security

497
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,600
practitioners that if our employees just

498
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,839
know more they would do something

499
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:20,880
differently

500
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:24,160
the thing is knowing isn't enough

501
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:25,759
and it's not really what our employees

502
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:27,920
know but what they do that matters

503
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,639
and if we take a look at knowledge alone

504
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:31,440
we see

505
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,759
that it only gets us a little bit of the

506
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:34,560
way

507
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,560
so lastpass did a really awesome study

508
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,880
in 2017 where they interviewed hundreds

509
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,000
of

510
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,600
users of their platform and what they

511
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:44,480
found was that a huge proportion of

512
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:45,440
their

513
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:48,720
users know what a secure password is

514
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,560
they know that it is important they

515
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,160
understand the risk of reusing the

516
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:54,320
password and yet

517
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:55,440
their knowledge doesn't actually

518
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,519
translate to action because

519
00:16:57,519 --> 00:16:59,120
when you take a look at the passwords

520
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,279
they have they choose easy to remember

521
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:02,079
passwords

522
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:04,240
they reuse them a huge percentage of the

523
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:05,919
time and so the delta

524
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:07,839
of what we know and what we do is

525
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:10,079
significant and we see this time and

526
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:12,319
time again not even just in security

527
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:15,679
if knowledge was enough everyone who

528
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:17,280
was a smoker would receive an

529
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:18,319
advertisement about the fact that

530
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:19,599
smoking kills and we would have no

531
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:20,319
smokers

532
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:23,520
in our in our society and yet that's uh

533
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,599
that's not the reality we have today so

534
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:27,039
so if knowledge

535
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:29,600
isn't enough what is our missing what's

536
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:32,160
the missing puzzle piece

537
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,640
so the thing that we're missing here is

538
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,240
motivation

539
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:39,360
if i am not motivated to learn

540
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:41,520
the information needed and then choose

541
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:42,799
to apply it

542
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:45,600
i will never change my behavior i will

543
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:46,000
never

544
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,160
stop clicking on phishing links i will

545
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:50,320
never start stop reporting no matter how

546
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:51,919
much i know

547
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:54,880
this should be a good practice before i

548
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:55,600
go into

549
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,440
what motivation looks like in

550
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:59,120
implementation i want to give you just a

551
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:01,200
little bit of behavioral science theory

552
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,960
so that you can understand how this maps

553
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,320
to a bigger picture

554
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:07,200
so in behavioral science concept the

555
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,120
formula for behavior change

556
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:10,880
consists of three things that happen at

557
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,480
the exact same time

558
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:14,880
i have to be motivated to do something i

559
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,880
have to have the ability to do something

560
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,960
and i need to have a prompt or trigger

561
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,480
or something that reminds me to do

562
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:21,280
something

563
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:24,000
so if i want to go running i need to be

564
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:24,880
motivated to

565
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:27,440
lose weight i need to have two feet that

566
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,559
work and

567
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:31,840
running shoes that are my size

568
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,600
and i need to be reminded to do it i

569
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:34,799
need to have a friend come over and say

570
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:35,840
let's go for a run

571
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:38,400
i need to have an alarm on my phone says

572
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,400
it's time to go for a run masha

573
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:43,440
and if any one of these things are

574
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:44,320
absent or

575
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:47,200
do are not present in enough proportion

576
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,039
you're not going to see the behavior

577
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:50,799
i may have the ability to go running but

578
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:52,720
if i don't care it doesn't matter you're

579
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:54,320
not going to get me to go running

580
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:56,799
so all of these need to exist in the

581
00:18:56,799 --> 00:18:58,000
right

582
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,440
amount and the right time for this to

583
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:01,120
happen so if we take a look

584
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:03,280
back into the example of phishing

585
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:04,720
training we find

586
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,960
that even if people have the ability

587
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:09,039
they're not motivated to do it

588
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:10,480
it's possible that they have neither the

589
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,240
ability nor the motivation

590
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:14,400
so let's take a look at how we tackle

591
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:15,600
motivation

592
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,200
i want to walk you through three

593
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,840
motivation hacks we've applied in our

594
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:20,640
research

595
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,880
and seen incredible impacts and results

596
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:24,640
in changing people's behavior

597
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,160
and these are all techniques that you

598
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,679
can take home and apply to your own

599
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:28,880
organization

600
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,640
the first and this is one of my

601
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,960
favorites is a motivational hack

602
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:35,440
called social proof now social proof

603
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:36,240
shows up in

604
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,559
so many parts of our lives it's the

605
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:40,720
reason why we are swayed by five-star

606
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,400
reviews on amazon

607
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:45,200
it's the reason when we go to a hotel

608
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,039
booking site and take a look at how many

609
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:48,720
other people are looking at this room

610
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,960
just right now or did you know this room

611
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:53,679
was booked 41 times in a day

612
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:55,919
social proof is the thing that says

613
00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:58,240
other people like you are doing this

614
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,440
behavior

615
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:01,760
and this is what good behavior looks

616
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,600
like this is what normal looks like

617
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:06,000
and we as human beings come from a herd

618
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,600
mentality and are constantly looking

619
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:08,080
around

620
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:11,039
us to say what is acceptable behavior

621
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:12,320
what should i be doing

622
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:15,039
and so advertising marketing and even

623
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:16,880
psychology has figured this out

624
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:19,760
and uses this in communication with the

625
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:20,640
average

626
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:23,280
end user and so we see this time and

627
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:24,640
time again

628
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,799
in motivating people to actually like

629
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:28,720
checking out of a hotel room or buying

630
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,880
purchases one of my favorite examples of

631
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:31,919
social proof

632
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:33,919
is the use in energy bills and energy

633
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:36,000
consumption and the company o power

634
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,520
started applying social proof by

635
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:39,039
comparing your energy use to your

636
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:39,919
neighbors

637
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:42,080
um and letting you know how far off you

638
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:44,400
were from your most efficient neighbors

639
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:48,159
thereby saving billions of dollars in um

640
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:48,480
on

641
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:51,600
in wasted energy use

642
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,120
there was a really great study done

643
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:54,880
about two years ago with a partnership

644
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,480
between facebook and georgia institute

645
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:57,760
of technology

646
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:00,400
that actually tracked using social proof

647
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,440
and the adoption

648
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,520
of multi-factor authentication in the

649
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:04,960
facebook platform

650
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,880
and what they found was that when they

651
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,880
presented

652
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,960
users logging in with a control prompt

653
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:11,919
that said hey

654
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:13,440
security is good for you please adopt

655
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:15,360
mfa they had a certain number of people

656
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:16,240
adopted

657
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:18,559
but when they created social context to

658
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:20,880
it they said hey did you know 108 of

659
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,720
your friends are already using security

660
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:24,400
measure and you should too

661
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:27,760
they had were 1.36 times more effective

662
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:30,799
in driving that adoption of mfa

663
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:32,400
we've applied similar types of social

664
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,159
proof across behaviors including

665
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:34,960
phishing

666
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:38,000
reporting password manager adoption

667
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,559
and so by taking data sets of what

668
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:42,799
employees are doing in an organization

669
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:46,240
you can compare every employee's actions

670
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:49,280
to their peer group and when we compare

671
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:51,919
our actions to people we know we are

672
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:53,440
much more likely

673
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:55,919
to change those behaviors to match our

674
00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:56,720
norm

675
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:59,679
so if by seeing the example in front of

676
00:21:59,679 --> 00:21:59,919
us

677
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:03,520
if you can show me that i compromise my

678
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,039
computer through clicking on

679
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:07,600
spearfishing way more

680
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:09,679
often than the rest of my department and

681
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:11,360
the rest of my company

682
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:13,360
we've we've been finding that employees

683
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:15,120
are much more motivated to engage

684
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:18,400
not in just this concept of of wanting

685
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:19,280
to participate

686
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:21,440
in in changing their behavior they're

687
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,360
also way more motivated to

688
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:26,159
take the follow-on training that helps

689
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:28,320
with course correct for the skill set

690
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:30,320
in fact when we do present these types

691
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:31,679
of messaging

692
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:34,880
we find over 60 engagement rate

693
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:37,039
month after month with participants of

694
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:38,960
this type of communication to see how

695
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:41,120
they're tracking over time

696
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:44,320
we also use a a

697
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:46,559
a social proof concept that is

698
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:48,320
leveraging celebrity social

699
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:51,039
proof and celebrity social proof is when

700
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:52,880
you show me someone rich and famous or

701
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:54,480
someone i know or

702
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,559
obsessively look up to is doing some

703
00:22:56,559 --> 00:22:57,840
kind of behavior that you want me to

704
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:58,480
emulate

705
00:22:58,480 --> 00:22:59,760
we see this all the time in

706
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:02,799
advertisements when a famous

707
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:06,320
sports star is using nike shoes for

708
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:06,960
example

709
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:08,640
and we want to buy those shoes because

710
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,159
if it's good enough for that person it's

711
00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:11,440
good enough for me

712
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:13,919
similarly for password manager adoption

713
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:15,679
we call out the most senior person in an

714
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:17,440
organization that uses this password

715
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:18,320
manager

716
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:20,559
thereby creating a social norm for

717
00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:22,480
employees say oh this is great

718
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:25,200
um and that's how social proof can be

719
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,480
applied

720
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:28,000
the second motivational hack i want to

721
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,400
walk you through is gamification

722
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,720
before i get too far into gamification i

723
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:34,320
want to set the record straight around

724
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:36,720
what gamification is and isn't

725
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:39,280
gamification is not about playing games

726
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:40,480
at work

727
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:43,760
uh and often it's just confused with

728
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:45,840
well if i bring monopoly into the

729
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:47,840
workforce and i gamification it's not

730
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:50,720
what gamification is is taking apart the

731
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:51,440
things that

732
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:54,400
make gaming successful and applying it

733
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:55,440
to business

734
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:58,240
to improve results the reason we take a

735
00:23:58,240 --> 00:23:59,840
look at game mechanics

736
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:02,480
is because games have figured out to a

737
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:04,799
billion dollar industry

738
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:06,880
how we get people to want to do

739
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,880
something instead of have to

740
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:11,360
and the reason that is is because games

741
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:12,000
leverage

742
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,600
something intrinsic to us as human

743
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:15,039
beings it

744
00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:18,240
leverages our desire to

745
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:22,080
be engaged to be motivated and to play

746
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:24,960
but what we've found in the study of

747
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,480
gamification and game design is that

748
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:28,080
there are five key elements

749
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:30,840
to making something successful to be

750
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:32,000
gamified

751
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,480
including in game playing and the first

752
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:36,559
one is autonomy

753
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:40,400
we as players like to have choices

754
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,559
don't tell me what to do give me the

755
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:44,240
choice to go left or right

756
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:47,039
that gives me a sense of ownership of

757
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:48,400
the experience

758
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:51,440
mastery i like to get better at what i'm

759
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:53,279
doing and if you can give me the tools

760
00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:56,400
i will be motivated to improve

761
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,640
we're we don't always love winning the

762
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,640
level we like the attempts at trying to

763
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:01,840
get there

764
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:05,120
feedback what how is my progress on this

765
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:06,640
particular action

766
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:10,159
am i getting better or worse purpose

767
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:12,080
what why am i doing this to begin with

768
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:14,000
what is the meaning behind this

769
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,080
the last thing is social all this means

770
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:18,320
more when we're connected with others

771
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:19,840
so i want to show you what gamification

772
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:22,000
looks like in our daily lives

773
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,400
this shows up everywhere whether or not

774
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:26,400
you you know to look for it

775
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:29,440
it's in our airline points and our miles

776
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:33,360
and this gamifies loyalty it gamifies

777
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:36,240
uh the ability to uh for an airline to

778
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:38,000
continue to drive us to use

779
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:42,000
their airline system and for rewards

780
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,640
status access to lounges and boarding

781
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:45,440
earlier

782
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:47,520
we change our behaviors and our

783
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:49,279
purchasing habits and our flying

784
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:50,320
patterns

785
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:53,600
um to co to allow us to

786
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:56,960
retain greater bonus points or mileage

787
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:57,840
credits

788
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:00,000
same thing with fitbit like approach

789
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,039
that

790
00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:03,200
tracks how many steps we have and

791
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:05,200
compares it to our peers

792
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:08,159
we try to level up it drives our coffee

793
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:10,240
purchasing habits with loyalty cards you

794
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:10,720
know

795
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:12,960
you have a punch card of 10 you get to

796
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,240
the 11th free

797
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:16,000
i'm continually getting feedback okay

798
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,520
i'm 9 out of 10.

799
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:20,880
this is a i'm connecting to the purpose

800
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:21,679
of

801
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:24,640
however however exciting for me is

802
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,000
another free coffee

803
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,440
but i am being gamified to continue to

804
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:31,760
repeat a behavior and even filling out

805
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:33,760
your linkedin profile is gamified

806
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:36,000
look how strong you are you're almost to

807
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,919
that gold star you just need to do one

808
00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:38,799
more step

809
00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:42,240
back to feedback back to mastery being a

810
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:44,720
full percentage uh like full hundred

811
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:46,400
percent filled out profile

812
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,320
so this is how we're using it in

813
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:51,120
business why not in security

814
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:52,960
so let me show you a couple of ways

815
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:55,279
where we've seen this play out

816
00:26:55,279 --> 00:26:57,679
on the left hand side you see a security

817
00:26:57,679 --> 00:26:59,120
strength chart

818
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:00,720
well we found it to be incredibly

819
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,480
effective in communicating the security

820
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:03,600
strength of an employee

821
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:05,360
it could be on one behavior it could be

822
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:07,120
on several behaviors combined

823
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:08,640
but when we can communicate to an

824
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,640
employee did you know

825
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:13,600
that your fishing performance is a two

826
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:14,480
out of five

827
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:15,760
make it a little bit friendlier and say

828
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:18,000
it's a tenuous out of an indestructible

829
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:18,640
scale

830
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:20,720
you got a little ways to go so we're

831
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:22,480
tying in elements of feedback we're

832
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:24,480
tying in opportunities for mastery

833
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:26,000
and we're giving people a sense of

834
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,520
purpose as you can see

835
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:28,799
the reason we need you to get to

836
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:31,039
instructable is because you need to

837
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:34,159
help us protect the company so instead

838
00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:35,760
of just saying hey take this training

839
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:36,799
it's a

840
00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:39,679
here are things you need to do to be a

841
00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:40,720
more resilient

842
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:44,240
security minded employee on the far

843
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:46,880
right side we see a similar kind of

844
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:48,000
leaderboard

845
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,559
so same concept that we would see in a

846
00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:52,640
game where are you on your top ranking

847
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:54,799
uh leaderboard can you do the same thing

848
00:27:54,799 --> 00:27:56,240
tied around behavior

849
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:57,600
i found this to be incredibly effective

850
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:00,000
for executives and for sales people

851
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,360
if you can show them how specific

852
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:04,000
behavior take reporting for example

853
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,720
how are your reporting trends compared

854
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:08,559
to people who look like you

855
00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:11,360
um and where are you on the leaderboard

856
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:13,200
and then the middle one

857
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:16,559
is a status level and

858
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:18,960
uh in in gaming this would be something

859
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,640
that we would call a streak

860
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:23,360
right and we're trying we'd be trying in

861
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:25,840
a game to not break our streak

862
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:27,840
we've seen this play out time and time

863
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:29,520
again around safety

864
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:31,919
right number of days since last accident

865
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:33,360
and yet

866
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:34,799
we haven't ever really seen this applied

867
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:36,559
to security very often

868
00:28:36,559 --> 00:28:38,720
this is a really great way of tying

869
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:40,559
security actions to

870
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:42,640
social which was one of the points or

871
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:44,559
altruism something bigger

872
00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:47,039
that bigger than just myself so if i

873
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:48,080
take a look

874
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:51,760
at how we would apply streaks to

875
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:53,679
security what if we had something that's

876
00:28:53,679 --> 00:28:55,279
in our organization say

877
00:28:55,279 --> 00:28:56,880
number of days since last malware

878
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:59,360
infection so as an employee when i

879
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:02,559
am down when i'm faced with a

880
00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:05,440
opportunity to download something will i

881
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:06,000
pause

882
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,399
just for an extra second because i don't

883
00:29:08,399 --> 00:29:09,840
want to be the person that resets the

884
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:11,120
company clock

885
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:14,480
and so what we're finding is that

886
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:18,000
if you don't just focus on hey take the

887
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:18,720
training

888
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:21,919
but allow motivation like leaderboards

889
00:29:21,919 --> 00:29:23,919
improvement or connecting it to a

890
00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:25,440
greater purpose where you

891
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:27,679
are trying to keep up with the security

892
00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:29,360
posture for the whole company

893
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:31,919
you're applying motivation to the

894
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:34,159
specific action we want

895
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:36,320
the last motivational hack i want to

896
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:37,440
walk you through is positive

897
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:39,039
reinforcement

898
00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:41,440
so when we talk about positive

899
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:43,919
motivation or negative motivation

900
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:46,320
as a security team we have one of those

901
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:47,360
two choices

902
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:49,200
we can either choose to reward a good

903
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:51,840
behavior or punish a bad behavior

904
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:55,279
and very often we see the stick show up

905
00:29:55,279 --> 00:29:57,679
we see that if you violate a policy

906
00:29:57,679 --> 00:29:59,600
you'll hear from the security team

907
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:01,520
but otherwise you're never going to hear

908
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:03,279
from the security team because

909
00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:06,080
to be totally honest security tends to

910
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:08,000
have a whole bunch of stuff to do and

911
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,840
they don't have time to reward people

912
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:10,880
for their good

913
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:13,200
good behavior and instead they're just

914
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:14,399
go you're just going to hear from them

915
00:30:14,399 --> 00:30:15,679
when it's bad behavior

916
00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:16,720
but i want to show you what that

917
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:18,799
actually looks like in changing behavior

918
00:30:18,799 --> 00:30:20,240
and why that may not be the right

919
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:21,600
approach

920
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:23,440
so taking a step back i wanted to define

921
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:25,520
for a second what negative reinforcement

922
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:26,399
looks like

923
00:30:26,399 --> 00:30:28,559
so negative reinforcement is when we do

924
00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:29,679
a behavior

925
00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:32,240
to avoid a negative outcome so as you

926
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:34,399
can see in this illustration

927
00:30:34,399 --> 00:30:36,000
i put on sunscreen not because i love

928
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,440
sunscreen but because i hate getting

929
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:38,399
sunburned

930
00:30:38,399 --> 00:30:41,520
so the the thing i'm reinforcing here is

931
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:44,799
application to avoid pain when we think

932
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:46,320
about security this is how we

933
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:50,159
again often show up i will continue to

934
00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:53,039
um i will change my password when the

935
00:30:53,039 --> 00:30:54,559
policy dictates

936
00:30:54,559 --> 00:30:56,640
because i don't want my access to get

937
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:58,799
locked out that's the negative outcome

938
00:30:58,799 --> 00:31:00,399
i'm going to take this training because

939
00:31:00,399 --> 00:31:03,760
i want my manager to stop nagging

940
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:05,919
so what does the opposite look like so

941
00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:07,440
this is positive enforcement

942
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:08,799
and we've seen time and time again the

943
00:31:08,799 --> 00:31:10,640
positive reinforcement when it applies

944
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:11,360
to

945
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:15,120
training our pets raising our children

946
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:17,919
even teaching us new skills as adults

947
00:31:17,919 --> 00:31:19,600
outside of security

948
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:22,080
works incredibly well in creating new

949
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:23,200
behaviors

950
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:26,320
so positive reinforcement allows us to

951
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:30,159
reinforce when and behavior is done well

952
00:31:30,159 --> 00:31:32,640
so in the case of this illustration

953
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:33,440
whenever

954
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:36,159
the dog spends a day not going to the

955
00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:37,600
bathroom inside the house but goes

956
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:38,240
outside

957
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:39,919
um underneath a tree like expected

958
00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:41,760
they're getting a treat

959
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:42,960
and so instead of being punished for a

960
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:44,720
bad behavior they are looking forward to

961
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:47,039
getting rewarded for the good behavior

962
00:31:47,039 --> 00:31:48,960
so let's apply that again to security

963
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:50,480
what does that look like

964
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:52,960
if you go back to the very first study

965
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:54,640
that we took a look at

966
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:56,880
we were treating training as a negative

967
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:58,559
reinforcement

968
00:31:58,559 --> 00:32:00,240
you clicked on the link now it's time to

969
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:02,799
take a training and so the motivation to

970
00:32:02,799 --> 00:32:03,600
not

971
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:05,039
click the link is to not take the

972
00:32:05,039 --> 00:32:07,279
training so why would the world would

973
00:32:07,279 --> 00:32:07,760
someone

974
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:09,440
possibly want to go through a training

975
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:11,039
when that is what we use

976
00:32:11,039 --> 00:32:14,559
as punishment instead of driving it

977
00:32:14,559 --> 00:32:17,360
as a positive outcome and something that

978
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:19,840
people voluntarily would choose into

979
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:21,360
so instead of taking a negative

980
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:23,200
reinforcement approach to do this or

981
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:24,640
else

982
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:26,320
what if we take security from a positive

983
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:28,799
reinforcement if you take a look at the

984
00:32:28,799 --> 00:32:30,720
times when security has been done well

985
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,240
if you take a look at everyone in the

986
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:34,799
organization who for example did not

987
00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:36,559
click on the phishing link and reported

988
00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:37,039
it

989
00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:39,679
and took that opportunity to give them

990
00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:41,840
kudos and accolades at a company-wide

991
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:42,480
level

992
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:44,640
to reinforce the rest of the company why

993
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:45,919
that is such a

994
00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:48,240
positive behavior that's desirable

995
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:50,159
you're going to begin to see

996
00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:51,840
more of that behavior show up in your

997
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:53,360
organization

998
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:54,880
and what i've seen time and time again

999
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:56,320
is pairing gamification with

1000
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:57,679
leaderboards

1001
00:32:57,679 --> 00:32:59,919
and tying it to all hands presentation

1002
00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:00,720
where you give

1003
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:02,799
positive reinforcement in kudos at a

1004
00:33:02,799 --> 00:33:04,320
company-wide level and saying

1005
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:06,399
these people did a great security

1006
00:33:06,399 --> 00:33:08,799
behavior and we want to call that out

1007
00:33:08,799 --> 00:33:11,200
so it's a shift in the way we approach

1008
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:12,559
this problem set

1009
00:33:12,559 --> 00:33:15,840
because it creates incentive to not just

1010
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:17,360
take the training and improve

1011
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:19,840
but it creates incentive to continue to

1012
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:21,760
the to do that type of behavior

1013
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:24,799
better and more frequently

1014
00:33:24,799 --> 00:33:26,080
and there's been a really great study

1015
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:27,840
done about this in 2014

1016
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:29,840
around using both positive and negative

1017
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:31,919
reinforcement and what this study

1018
00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:35,200
found was that yes punishment can be an

1019
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:37,200
effective tool changing behavior

1020
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:39,519
but it has a side effect where it

1021
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:41,120
reduces morale

1022
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:44,640
and positive reinforcement is is

1023
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:46,960
as effective in increasing uh the

1024
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:48,720
desired behavior but also has a

1025
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:50,799
secondary benefit of creating enthusiasm

1026
00:33:50,799 --> 00:33:52,799
engagement and satisfaction among staff

1027
00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:55,440
which in security is what we need to

1028
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:56,880
start changing our brand from the

1029
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:58,320
department of no

1030
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:01,519
to creating alliances and engaging our

1031
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:02,240
employees

1032
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:05,039
as part of the defense and what we've

1033
00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:05,519
seen

1034
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:08,560
in the dozens of deployments we've seen

1035
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:10,639
we've applied these different techniques

1036
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:13,359
around motivational

1037
00:34:13,359 --> 00:34:14,639
improvements and behavioral science

1038
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:17,199
approaches is time and time again

1039
00:34:17,199 --> 00:34:20,079
significant changes to efficient

1040
00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:22,000
compromises employee reporting

1041
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:25,199
and password manager adoption

1042
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:28,960
so what i want to leave you with are

1043
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:30,480
two sets of findings that we talked

1044
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:32,639
about the first

1045
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:35,599
is the study of cohorts and predictive

1046
00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:36,000
uh

1047
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:39,280
analytics can we understand

1048
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:40,800
who is going to be a good and a bad

1049
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:43,040
security performer and what we found was

1050
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:43,440
that

1051
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:45,760
tenure was in fact a really strong

1052
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:46,960
indicator of

1053
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:49,199
fishing resiliency and those employees

1054
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:50,480
that are accompanied less than three

1055
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:50,879
years

1056
00:34:50,879 --> 00:34:53,679
or more than 16 performed the worst

1057
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:55,520
geography was a really great indicator

1058
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:57,520
of password manager adoption

1059
00:34:57,520 --> 00:35:00,720
and late training had a correlation to

1060
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:02,560
clicking on

1061
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:05,280
phishing links and reporting less and

1062
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:06,480
when we take a look at the second

1063
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:07,359
question of

1064
00:35:07,359 --> 00:35:09,200
well what can we do about our risky

1065
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:11,760
cohorts we're finding that motivation

1066
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:12,720
needs to be applied

1067
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:15,359
in addition to training to get our

1068
00:35:15,359 --> 00:35:16,160
employees

1069
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:19,680
to both want to take the training

1070
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:21,839
and adjust their knowledge levels and

1071
00:35:21,839 --> 00:35:22,880
secondly

1072
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:25,119
to actually apply the things that they

1073
00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:27,200
learned to change their behavior and

1074
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:28,880
want to improve those

1075
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:32,640
those actions and we all have the choice

1076
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:34,960
and the ability to apply techniques like

1077
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:36,079
social proof

1078
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:39,119
gamification and positive reinforcement

1079
00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:40,880
to achieve these types of behavioral

1080
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:44,480
change goals that we're trying to get to

1081
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:46,960
we at elevate security are constantly

1082
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:48,400
keeping on top of

1083
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:50,079
the latest research in the space and so

1084
00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:52,079
if you'd like to follow us and learn a

1085
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:53,520
little bit more about

1086
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:55,520
what we're finding in our data sets and

1087
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:58,079
in our research please follow us here

1088
00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:02,200
and with that happy to take any
