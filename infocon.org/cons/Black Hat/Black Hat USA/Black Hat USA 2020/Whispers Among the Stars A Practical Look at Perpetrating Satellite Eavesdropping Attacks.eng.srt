00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:20,400
2018 a sysadmin logs into the control

00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:21,920
panel of a wind turbine

5
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:23,920
in southern france to update its

00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:25,439
firmware

7
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:28,560
more than 600 kilometers away his php

00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:29,439
session token

00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:32,320
appears on my screen eight months later

10
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:33,920
an egyptian oil tanker

11
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:36,079
pulls into the port of stacks tunisia

12
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:37,760
with a malfunctioning alternator on

13
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:38,640
board

14
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,879
from my vantage point more than 1500

15
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:42,160
kilometers away

16
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:43,760
i learned that the ship will be out of

17
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:45,440
commission for at least a month

18
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:46,879
and i learned the name and passport

19
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:48,800
number of the engineer who's flying in

20
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,320
to fix it

21
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:53,280
just this summer 13 000 meters above the

22
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:54,559
atlantic ocean

23
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:56,320
the accountant of a polish real estate

24
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:58,000
group puts the finishing touches

25
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,640
on their annual financial report the

26
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,320
word document she prepares

27
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:04,799
reaches my computer at the same time it

28
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:06,720
arrives in the inbox of her colleagues

29
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,320
at one of europe's largest commercial

30
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:09,920
real estate groups

31
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:11,840
how does this kind of thing happen and

32
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:13,280
what can we do to protect this

33
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:15,360
information in the future

34
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,600
i'm james pavor i'm a phd student at

35
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:18,799
oxford university

36
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:20,320
where i research satellite cyber

37
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:22,560
security and today i want to talk about

38
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,400
the results of more than two years of

39
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,280
experiments

40
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:26,880
looking at the real world use of

41
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,560
satellite broadband

42
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,400
i do this work with a bunch of talented

43
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,400
people from both the uk and switzerland

44
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,799
and i'm honored to share what we found

45
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:36,640
so this started out as a fairly small

46
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:37,360
project

47
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:39,200
we wanted to replicate some really cool

48
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,680
findings from the mid to late 2000s

49
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:43,280
these researchers discovered that there

50
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,960
were these television satellites that

51
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,799
were being used for internet signals

52
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:48,479
and that if you had the right equipment

53
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:50,240
you could receive deeply sensitive

54
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,040
information

55
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,720
that was being transmitted unencrypted

56
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,159
across these feeds

57
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:56,159
now a lot has changed both about the way

58
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:57,200
we use the internet

59
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,920
and the way we use satellites since 2005

60
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,520
and so what i wanted to do was update

61
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:02,960
this research and take a broader

62
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,640
systemic look at it

63
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,719
so we ended up conducting a series of

64
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:07,680
case studies

65
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,679
looking at different domains

66
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:11,440
specifically people on land

67
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:14,959
at air and in the sea in total we

68
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:16,560
analyzed signals from 18

69
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:19,040
satellites in geostationary orbit with a

70
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:21,280
combined coverage area that exceeded 100

71
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,000
million square

72
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,640
kilometers to put that into perspective

73
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,080
it means we were able to intercept

74
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,160
signals from parts of the united states

75
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,120
the caribbean

76
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,680
china and india a massive potential

77
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:32,720
attack area

78
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,640
and we found across all 18 of these

79
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,800
satellites that sensitive information

80
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,879
was still being leaked in clear text

81
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:40,400
both in those older protocols they've

82
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,760
had vulnerabilities that have been known

83
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:42,959
since the 2000s

84
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:44,480
as well as newer protocols that have

85
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,480
come to replace them and this wasn't

86
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:47,760
just some boring data

87
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,200
these were interesting companies and

88
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,440
interesting individuals we saw sensitive

89
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:52,000
traffic

90
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,599
from at least nine members of the

91
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:55,360
fortune global 500

92
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,599
traffic from passengers flying on six of

93
00:02:57,599 --> 00:02:59,519
the 10 largest airlines in the world by

94
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:01,040
passenger count

95
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,879
sensitive data from maritime companies

96
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:04,560
who together account for more than 40

97
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,040
percent

98
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,640
of the world's cargo shipping capacity

99
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,800
by volume

100
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,159
and even traffic from government

101
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:12,159
agencies like the postal service of an

102
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:13,680
eastern european country

103
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,599
or an air force jet belonging to a north

104
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:16,959
african nation

105
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:19,599
we even saw traffic from people like you

106
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:21,360
people who might be browsing wi-fi in a

107
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,400
remote coffee shop

108
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,080
or updating their instagram while on a

109
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,799
cruise before i delve into the contents

110
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:28,319
of this traffic and kind of how we got

111
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:29,120
at it though

112
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,400
it's important to have a basic

113
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,680
understanding of what satellite

114
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,120
communications look like

115
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,239
so we're going to run through a very

116
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:36,720
simple scenario we have a satellite here

117
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,400
in geostationary orbit

118
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,319
that means it's 30 000 kilometers away

119
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:41,440
from the earth's surface

120
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,040
and always looks like it's in the same

121
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,959
spot in the sky

122
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:46,720
we have a customer here in the middle of

123
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,799
the atlantic ocean on a cargo ship

124
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:50,799
and they want to visit a website hosted

125
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:53,360
in ireland we'll say google.com

126
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,439
to do this they'll use a vsat terminal

127
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:56,400
on their boat

128
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,159
which is provided by a satellite

129
00:03:58,159 --> 00:03:59,840
internet service provider who operates a

130
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:00,720
ground station

131
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:03,200
here in madrid we'll also imagine an

132
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,000
attacker

133
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
way down here in a craw who wants to

134
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,680
intercept this communications despite

135
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,360
being very far away

136
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,920
so how does this all play out first the

137
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,519
customer in the cargo vessel points a

138
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:14,000
satellite

139
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
dish at a spot in the sky and says get

140
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,680
me google.com

141
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,199
the satellite doesn't do much it's

142
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:20,880
essentially a dumb bent pipe

143
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,639
and just beams that signal right back

144
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:24,639
down to the ground station in madrid

145
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:26,400
you'll notice this beam is very narrow

146
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,160
and focused meaning our attacker in a

147
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,840
croc can't intercept this communication

148
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:32,400
it passes right over their head

149
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,759
once a signal reaches the internet

150
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:35,680
service provider in madrid they convert

151
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,280
whatever weird satellite protocols are

152
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,000
being used

153
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,160
to normal ip traffic and route it across

154
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,360
a terrestrial internet

155
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,720
just like you would if you're visiting a

156
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:45,040
website at home the isp gets the

157
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,240
response from google

158
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,600
bundles it back up into satellite

159
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,919
protocols and beams it into space

160
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:51,600
it's worth noting that when i say beams

161
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,840
into space this is not a quick process

162
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,759
geostationary orbit is far away and the

163
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:57,520
speed of light is only so fast

164
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,600
so we're talking about 700 milliseconds

165
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,120
of latency for this kind of

166
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,400
communication

167
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,400
once we finally make it to orbit the

168
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,160
last step is to beam this signal back

169
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,840
down to earth

170
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:10,320
but with a critical difference this time

171
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,000
we're going to send in a really wide

172
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:12,400
beam

173
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,600
because we want to cover as many

174
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,919
customers as possible and satellites are

175
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:17,360
very expensive

176
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,199
so what you see here is that the radio

177
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:21,360
waves carrying that response from google

178
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,440
hit our attacker's dish in ghana at the

179
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,039
same time as they reach our customer in

180
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:26,880
the middle of the atlantic ocean

181
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,320
this is the crux of satellite

182
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,880
eavesdropping an attacker can reliably

183
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,080
expect to intercept

184
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:34,240
one direction of the communications from

185
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,639
a vast distance away from their target

186
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:38,240
if we compare this to a hypothetical

187
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,919
vulnerability and say wi-fi

188
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:42,000
or gsm where the attacker has to be in

189
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,080
your neighborhood or in your city

190
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,440
an attacker listening to satellite

191
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,120
communications could be in a different

192
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,560
country or a different continent from

193
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,720
their victim

194
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,560
so how does this actually play out what

195
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,840
does an attacker need

196
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:55,360
to pull off this attack and listen to

197
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,759
these signals if they're a nation-state

198
00:05:57,759 --> 00:05:58,240
actor

199
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:00,000
all they need is money there are

200
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,520
companies out there that develop these

201
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,280
specialized modems for intelligence

202
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,639
collection purposes

203
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:06,240
that allow governments to essentially

204
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,759
listen to whatever satellite signals

205
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:08,479
they want

206
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:09,919
you build a big multi-million dollar

207
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:11,360
ground station like this one and you're

208
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,800
off to the races

209
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,400
unfortunately they don't give this kind

210
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,319
of equipment to phd students

211
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:17,919
so we had to come up with a way to try

212
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:19,600
to use consumer equipment essentially

213
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,039
home television equipment

214
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:23,360
to listen to these signals we purchased

215
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,360
this simple flat panel satellite dish

216
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,120
although honestly any satellite dish

217
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,560
would do something that's already

218
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,680
rusting on your roof or off of

219
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,039
craigslist or gumtree for

220
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:33,759
basically free and then we used a pcie

221
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:35,199
satellite tuner card

222
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:36,800
these are widely available for people

223
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,160
who want to watch satellite television

224
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,199
on their computer

225
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:41,039
we used a higher end professional model

226
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:43,840
which tends to cost between 200 and 300

227
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,120
but you could get away with a much

228
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,280
cheaper one in the 50 to 80 price range

229
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,720
at the cost of not being able to

230
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,560
reliably listen to some of the more

231
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:53,599
complicated modulation schemes

232
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:55,520
so once we have this equipment the next

233
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:56,639
task is to actually listen to a

234
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:57,840
satellite with it

235
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,199
figuring out where to point our dish is

236
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:00,880
easy the locations of the satellites are

237
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,240
public information

238
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,759
but figuring out what to listen to is a

239
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:05,520
little more complicated so i'll show you

240
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,599
what it looks like in the lab

241
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:09,199
what we're going to go ahead and do is

242
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:11,039
use this tool called ebs

243
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:12,880
pro which is designed to help people

244
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,479
find satellite television channels to

245
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:15,440
listen to

246
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:16,880
and we're going to use it to try to hunt

247
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,800
for some internet feeds we're going to

248
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,400
point our satellite dish at a spot in

249
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,400
the sky that we know has a satellite

250
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,160
and we're going to scan the ku band of

251
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,000
the radio spectrum to try to find

252
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,240
signals against the background noise

253
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,759
this particular satellite is at an

254
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:31,599
unfortunate angle and it has very low

255
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:32,560
signal quality

256
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,160
but hopefully we'll find a couple of

257
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,919
channels that we can delve into a little

258
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:36,960
bit deeper

259
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,720
the way we'll identify channels is by

260
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,400
looking for distinct humps in the radio

261
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,080
spectrum like these

262
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:43,280
because they stick out against the

263
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,560
background noise we can guess that

264
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,240
there's something going on there

265
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,160
we'll tell our card to tune to this one

266
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,520
and treat it as a digital video

267
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,360
broadcasting for satellite feed

268
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,960
after a few seconds we get a lock on

269
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,879
that feed meaning we successfully found

270
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:56,560
and connected to the satellite

271
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,840
what we're going to go ahead and do is

272
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,360
connect to this slightly weaker one

273
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,400
because i know it has something

274
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,000
interesting in it for the demo

275
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,440
you'll see the signal-to-noise ratio

276
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,199
here is atrocious we're likely going to

277
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:06,479
lose a lot of data

278
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:07,759
but hopefully we'll find something

279
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:10,000
interesting anyway i'm going to next

280
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,680
jot down some basic information about

281
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,280
this feed the frequency

282
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,840
the polarization and the symbol rate and

283
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,440
that's because this tool will only take

284
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,080
us so far

285
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,680
it's designed for television and what we

286
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,360
really want is raw data out of that

287
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,440
digital video broadcasting feed

288
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:24,800
to do that we're going to use a tool

289
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,639
that's provided with the pcie card by

290
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:28,319
the device manufacturer as part of its

291
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:30,000
drivers

292
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,680
so i'll go ahead and connect to that

293
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,200
satellite fee that we discovered

294
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,320
and try to make it just a short

295
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,159
recording for us to play around with

296
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:37,760
i'll save it to the desktop now the

297
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,279
amount of data that's going to go into

298
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:40,000
this file is

299
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,360
hugely variable it might be a megabyte

300
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,880
of data in a week it might be a terabyte

301
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,320
of data in a week it really depends on

302
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,519
the satellite you're listening to and

303
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:48,959
the equipment we're using

304
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:50,320
in this case i'm just going to record a

305
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,839
couple of kilobytes and then we're going

306
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:53,120
to see if there's anything in there

307
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:55,120
indicating that it's internet traffic

308
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,360
there's no dark magic to this process

309
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,640
i'm just going to look through that raw

310
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:01,360
binary file for the string http

311
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,800
which we'd expect to see an internet

312
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,320
capture but wouldn't expect to see in a

313
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,920
television feed

314
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,839
and sure enough if we take a look here

315
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:09,279
we see the output of what looks like a

316
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:09,680
soap

317
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:12,080
api at this point we have found a

318
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,519
security vulnerability

319
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:15,360
this is internet traffic that wasn't

320
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,279
intended for us that we were able to

321
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:18,399
intercept using

322
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:20,160
freely available tools and cheap

323
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,760
off-the-shelf equipment

324
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,440
but what we'd want to do as an attacker

325
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,959
is understand a little bit more

326
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:26,880
about the semantics of this connection

327
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,480
what ports are being used which ip

328
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,760
addresses are working together

329
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,839
what do the packets actually look like

330
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:33,279
and to do that we have to look a little

331
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:35,279
deeper into this file

332
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:36,720
so there are two protocols we looked at

333
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,120
the first i'm going to talk about is

334
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,680
mpeg-ts

335
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,279
now you might be saying mpeg isn't that

336
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:42,880
a video streaming format

337
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,959
and you'd be exactly right mpeg is

338
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:46,399
widely used for streaming satellite

339
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:47,920
television feeds as video

340
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,519
as well as many other videos across the

341
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:51,440
web and over the years it's had

342
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,800
additional features built in

343
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,560
things that allow you to say pause live

344
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,080
satellite television

345
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:58,240
and so these interactivity features have

346
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,600
been sort of hacked together

347
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,279
to enable encapsulation layers for

348
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:03,040
sending internet traffic

349
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,640
because mpeg is such a widely used

350
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,560
standard there's great tooling already

351
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:07,920
out there for working with it

352
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,680
in fact if you get a high enough quality

353
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,519
signal recording you may just be able to

354
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:14,880
open the file directly in wireshark

355
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,480
as a result this is where a lot of prior

356
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,079
research has looked the research from

357
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:19,920
the mid to late 2000s that i was talking

358
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:20,399
about

359
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:21,920
was mostly about kind of connecting all

360
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,440
the tools in the right way and then

361
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,959
using wireshark or using one of these

362
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:25,839
existing tools

363
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:28,880
to parse the files however mpeg is sort

364
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:29,519
of dying

365
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:30,800
it's still popular for satellite

366
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,399
internet but it's getting replaced by

367
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:33,920
more intuitive protocols like generic

368
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:36,320
stream encapsulation or gse

369
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,720
gse is much simpler it takes an ip

370
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:39,360
payload

371
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,680
it wraps it in a generic gse stream

372
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,200
which is a bunch of different fragments

373
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,399
and then puts that into the digital

374
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:46,320
video broadcasting feed

375
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,160
this is particularly popular we found

376
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,839
among enterprise customers who rent an

377
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:51,279
entire satellite transponder for their

378
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:52,399
networks

379
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:53,839
these enterprise customers have a lot

380
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:55,360
more money than we do and so they have a

381
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,640
lot nicer equipment

382
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:57,920
they tended to be using receiver

383
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,600
hardware that cost in the tens or even

384
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,440
hundreds of thousands of dollars

385
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,279
and so the signals they were sending had

386
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:05,040
more complicated modulations than our

387
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,640
cheap hardware could keep up with

388
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,640
and we were often losing huge chunks of

389
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:12,160
these feeds resulting in corrupted files

390
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:14,240
to fix this we wrote a forensic tool

391
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,680
called gsextract

392
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:18,000
that tries to reconstruct meaningful ip

393
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,640
data out of a corrupted gse recording

394
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,720
the way it does this is by cheating it

395
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,720
makes some general assumptions about

396
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,800
where the start of an ip packet would go

397
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,000
or where a fragment should

398
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
belong in a stream that wouldn't work if

399
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,440
we were like trying to build a robust

400
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,399
satellite modem

401
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:34,079
but allow us to figure out what to do

402
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:36,560
with between 50 and 70

403
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,560
of the actual packets that we're

404
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:39,920
receiving on our dish

405
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:41,519
which is way better than existing tools

406
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:42,640
that would just kind of throw an error

407
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:43,839
message

408
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:45,200
hopefully by the time you're watching

409
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,959
this presentation gsextract will be on

410
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:48,399
my research groups github

411
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:49,360
we're still going through some

412
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,880
responsible disclosure work to make that

413
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:51,440
happen

414
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:53,200
so it may be a little bit delayed but in

415
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,560
the interim if you're interested in some

416
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:55,760
of the technical details

417
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,360
there's a much more deep technical

418
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,959
description of it in the appendix of an

419
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:00,320
academic paper we published a little

420
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,240
while back

421
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:04,000
all right we're in a pretty good spot

422
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,839
right now we have the equipment we need

423
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:07,200
to listen to satellites

424
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,040
we know that we can parse feeds in the

425
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,880
digital video broadcasting for satellite

426
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:11,680
standard

427
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,279
and depending on what's inside that we

428
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:14,959
can use existing tools or a tool we

429
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:15,839
wrote ourselves

430
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:18,399
to convert it into a pcap file the next

431
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:19,440
step is really to

432
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:22,320
understand what this means for customers

433
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,120
at land

434
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:26,240
at sea or in the sky across all three of

435
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,600
those domains though there's some

436
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,120
general things we found

437
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:31,519
the first is that these satellite isps

438
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:33,120
did not seem to be employing any

439
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,639
encryption by default

440
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:36,720
that is to say customers may choose to

441
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,959
encrypt their traffic but isps were

442
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:41,040
sending traffic over the satellite feed

443
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,800
in the same security characteristics it

444
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,079
had when it reached that modem at the

445
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:45,519
customer's home

446
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:47,200
this isn't to say that there aren't isps

447
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,880
out there that offer encrypted satellite

448
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:49,519
internet

449
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:52,320
just that we weren't looking at them

450
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,000
what this means is that an attacker

451
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,680
who's listening to your satellite signal

452
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,279
gets to see what your internet service

453
00:12:57,279 --> 00:12:58,880
provider would expect to see

454
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,399
every packet that comes to your modem

455
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:01,839
every bit torrent you download every

456
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:03,040
website you visit

457
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,560
passes over that link and could be

458
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:07,040
intercepted but it gets even worse if we

459
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,639
look at enterprise customers

460
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:10,079
because a lot of them were operating

461
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:11,680
what was essentially a corporate land

462
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:14,000
network over these satellite feeds

463
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,079
for example imagine a cruise line that

464
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:17,680
has a bunch of windows devices aboard

465
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:18,639
its ships

466
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:20,399
this windows local area network with

467
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:22,399
like all that internal ldap traffic and

468
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:23,680
ftp traffic

469
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,440
will be broadcast over the satellite

470
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,279
link giving an eavesdropper

471
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:29,839
perspective from behind the firewall a

472
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:31,440
very unique angle for a wireless

473
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:33,440
eavesdropper to get on a corporate it

474
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,440
environment

475
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,639
so let's talk about terrestrial

476
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:38,560
customers what i was really interested

477
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:40,079
in here is privacy because these are

478
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:41,360
kind of your normal home

479
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:43,279
internet users now you might be saying

480
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:44,399
wait a minute james

481
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:46,320
you're just trying to scare me because i

482
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,160
know when i open my browser i see this

483
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,519
nifty lock icon

484
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:50,800
which tells me that my traffic is

485
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,959
encrypted so an eavesdropper can't see

486
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:54,480
its contents

487
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:56,480
i would say to you convenient made up

488
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:58,560
strawman that actually the case is a

489
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,320
little bit more complicated than that

490
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:02,000
because our isp vantage point gives us

491
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,360
some unique perspectives on what you're

492
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,240
doing

493
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:06,480
for example your dns queries are likely

494
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:07,760
still sent unencrypted

495
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,199
so we can piece together your internet

496
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:10,800
browsing history and which websites

497
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:11,839
you're visiting

498
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:13,600
even those tls certificates which are

499
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,360
protecting the contents of your traffic

500
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,040
or also fingerprinting the servers

501
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,639
you're talking to and the services

502
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:19,920
you're connecting to

503
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,839
now this raises some intuitive privacy

504
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:23,120
concerns you don't want just anyone

505
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,720
knowing your web browsing history

506
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,800
but it gets much worse if you ever slip

507
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:27,920
up

508
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:30,160
a good example of this is this lawyer in

509
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:32,160
spain we intercepted this email

510
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:32,959
conversation

511
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:34,320
that he was having with a client about

512
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,160
an upcoming court case now

513
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:37,920
obviously this raises serious concerns

514
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,199
for attorney-client privilege and

515
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:40,880
personal communications privacy

516
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,399
but in our threat model it gets even

517
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:44,399
worse because at this point

518
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:46,480
we know every website this lawyer visits

519
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,000
we have access to the contents of his

520
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,440
email inbox and we know his email

521
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:50,240
address

522
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:52,000
so we can say hey this guy goes to

523
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,279
paypal.com

524
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:55,360
we can go to paypal click that i forgot

525
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,880
my password link

526
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,079
put in the email address that we've

527
00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:00,800
hijacked and steal his paypal account or

528
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,160
any other account

529
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:04,560
this kind of shows how an eavesdropper

530
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:05,920
who's each dropping on all of your

531
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:07,279
connections like an internet service

532
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:08,000
provider

533
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,240
can do significantly worse harm to you

534
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,760
that someone is only a man in the middle

535
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:14,639
on a specific connection

536
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:16,240
another thing we were curious about that

537
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:18,320
didn't really exist back in 2005 when

538
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,519
this research started

539
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:21,360
was iot and connected critical

540
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,639
infrastructure systems

541
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:24,000
and we found that a lot of these were

542
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,680
operating insecurely over the satellite

543
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:26,560
link

544
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:29,040
a good example is this login page for a

545
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,800
cisco router that was being run by one

546
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,079
of europe's largest electricity

547
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:33,120
providers

548
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,959
and what we see here are admin

549
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:36,880
credentials being sent unencrypted

550
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,000
now i've blocked out most of the

551
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
sensitive data but if you have a keen

552
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:40,480
eye

553
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:41,920
you'll note that the host ip address

554
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:43,680
here is publicly routable

555
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,440
meaning anyone with a web browser could

556
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,360
use these credentials to log in and

557
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:48,399
start screwing around with that

558
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:49,600
electricity provider's network

559
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,120
configurations

560
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,560
another good example is something i

561
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,240
mentioned at the start we found that a

562
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,440
lot of wind turbines

563
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:56,959
use satellite which makes sense because

564
00:15:56,959 --> 00:15:58,399
they're in remote locations that may not

565
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:00,079
have a wired connection

566
00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:02,720
these terminals will often also have a

567
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:03,600
connection a

568
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,600
control panel for changing settings of

569
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:06,800
the power station

570
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,399
and we found out that the credentials

571
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:10,079
for these were often being sent in clear

572
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:12,000
text over the satellite link

573
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,440
and that they were publicly routable

574
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,720
meaning that anyone on the internet

575
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,079
could combine that and start messing

576
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:18,160
around with electricity infrastructure

577
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:20,240
now we didn't actually do this so there

578
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,920
may be a second layer of protection

579
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:23,360
behind this login page that we didn't

580
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,240
account for

581
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,320
but it's at least intuitively concerning

582
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,360
that these credentials are being

583
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,920
broadcast in clear text

584
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:32,079
let's head out to see so the maritime

585
00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:33,440
use case is interesting

586
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,120
because each boat is kind of an

587
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,800
independent entity it has its own

588
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,320
operational technology and its own

589
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,079
purpose and its own function

590
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:41,360
and so we had these terabytes and

591
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:43,600
terabytes of maritime traffic

592
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,759
and we wanted to understand kind of how

593
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:47,519
hard it would be to identify specific

594
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:49,920
ships in that massive amount of data so

595
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:52,000
we picked a hundred random ip addresses

596
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,519
and devised a basic fingerprint

597
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:55,519
consisting of dns queries tls

598
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:56,320
certificates

599
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:57,680
and some strings from the first couple

600
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:59,680
of bytes of their traffic to see if we

601
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:01,519
could actually de-anonymize these ip

602
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:03,360
addresses and tie them to specific ships

603
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,720
in the ocean

604
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,240
we were able to do this in a specific

605
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:08,160
case study with about 10

606
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,760
of the vessels we looked at which are

607
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,280
listed here i've blacked out their names

608
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,400
for privacy reasons

609
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,760
but you can kind of get a feeling from

610
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:15,679
this table of the scope of potential

611
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:16,640
impact

612
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,400
so the smallest fleet we looked at was

613
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,959
this single vessel fishing fleet

614
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:22,400
that was using some kind of software to

615
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,839
tell it where fish was over the

616
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:25,119
satellite feed

617
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:27,039
on the flip side we see this massive

618
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:28,960
container ship one of the larger ships

619
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,240
in the world for one of the largest

620
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:31,600
shipping companies in the world

621
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,440
operating in the same ip space as that

622
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:34,960
random fishing vessel

623
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:37,440
beyond just being able to identify ships

624
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:38,960
we were also able to identify

625
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:41,200
operational technology on board them a

626
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,120
good example of what this means is this

627
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:45,200
subsea repair ship operated by a major

628
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,799
petroleum company

629
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:48,960
what we saw on board was traffic that

630
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,400
indicated the presence of a

631
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,240
vulnerable box running windows server

632
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:53,840
2003.

633
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,200
if you were trying to target this oil

634
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,120
company you might consider deploying

635
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:59,840
cves that targeted the specific software

636
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:01,120
not just on that ship

637
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:02,640
but against their entire fleet which

638
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:06,000
likely has a similar software build out

639
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,440
one specific piece of operational

640
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:09,120
technology we're curious about

641
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:10,720
is something called an actus terminal or

642
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:11,919
an electronic chart displaying

643
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:13,280
information system

644
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:14,559
active terminals are essentially like

645
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:16,320
gps nav systems for boats

646
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:17,520
they tell you where it's safe for your

647
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:18,960
boat to go and where it's legal for it

648
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:19,520
to go

649
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:20,799
and there's been a lot of security

650
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:22,480
research on them which makes sense

651
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:22,960
because

652
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,559
if someone messes with your navigational

653
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:26,480
charts and say hides a sandbar and

654
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,240
causes your oil tanker to run around

655
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,640
that could be extremely catastrophic but

656
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,240
we found is that a lot of

657
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:34,720
customers are still using older formats

658
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,000
that don't have the cryptographic

659
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:36,720
protections

660
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,320
that have been designed to protect

661
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:40,320
against these attacks or they're using

662
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:41,520
proprietary formats

663
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:42,960
they don't seem to have ever had these

664
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:45,120
protections now you might be saying wait

665
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:46,000
a minute james

666
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
you're a passive eavesdropper certainly

667
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,200
you might be able to get yourself a free

668
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,559
nautical chart if you wanted

669
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:52,400
but how could you possibly tamper with

670
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,559
the contents of this traffic

671
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:56,480
and it turns out it's not as hard as you

672
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,080
would think because of the way these

673
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:00,160
charts are often updated

674
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:02,559
for example this specific ship got its

675
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:04,480
chart updates via a publicly routable

676
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:07,440
ftp service that was running on board

677
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:08,880
we were able to capture the logging

678
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:10,720
credentials over the satellite feed

679
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,240
and whenever someone sent a chart update

680
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:14,080
they would log into the ftp service

681
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:16,000
copy the files over and then those files

682
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
will be deployed to the actus terminal

683
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,679
deploying a malicious chart or a piece

684
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:21,679
of targeted malware is simply a matter

685
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:22,880
of getting the right username and

686
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:24,480
password and logging in from any

687
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,880
computer connected to the internet

688
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:29,600
likewise a very common mode in the

689
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,280
industry for getting chart updates is

690
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:32,720
via email services

691
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,160
there's nothing inherently insecure

692
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,600
about this you get an email it says

693
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,039
attached to your latest chart

694
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:38,559
you copied onto a flash drive you plug

695
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:40,559
it into your actus terminal but in this

696
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:42,400
case the captain happened to be using an

697
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,400
insecure email server running pop

698
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,160
with no encryption and so we got

699
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,440
essentially a template

700
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:48,960
of the sort of information we need to

701
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:50,799
send to convince them to copy a false

702
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:52,240
chart or a piece of malware

703
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:53,840
onto his ship's critical information

704
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:56,160
systems

705
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,840
so it's fun to talk about operational

706
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:59,679
technology but there are real people

707
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:01,679
aboard vessels with privacy concerns

708
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:03,280
like billionaires aboard their super

709
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:05,120
yachts now i know standing up at a

710
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,000
security conference

711
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,919
and being like think of the billionaires

712
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:09,919
isn't the most popular thing to do

713
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:12,080
but this story is really fun so we were

714
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:13,120
listening to traffic

715
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:15,360
from this greek billionaire's yacht and

716
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:16,799
one day his captain

717
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:19,120
forgot his microsoft account login and

718
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:21,120
so the account reset password was sent

719
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:23,520
over clear text on the satellite feed

720
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:25,120
at this point we had a route where we

721
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:26,400
could have potentially hijacked this

722
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,600
captain's account

723
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,280
and targeting an extremely high net

724
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:30,640
worth individual

725
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,720
via targeted social engineering attacks

726
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:34,640
you might also imagine that billionaires

727
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:35,760
have certain things about their web

728
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,200
browsing history or patterns

729
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,320
that they don't want to be public

730
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,760
knowledge and certainly not at the scale

731
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:42,000
of a satellite signal

732
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,080
another situation that we ran into that

733
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:45,760
was pretty common is crew members have

734
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:47,120
to share certain data with port

735
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:47,760
authorities

736
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,280
about their visa and their passport

737
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:51,440
status this particular port authority

738
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:53,760
had them do that via a public http

739
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:54,880
service

740
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,640
meaning that we were able to get for

741
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,480
example from this cargo vessel

742
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:00,320
lists of all the crew members their date

743
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:02,159
of birth and their passport numbers

744
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:04,240
shouted in clear text across an entire

745
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:06,240
continent

746
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:08,400
let's head out to the skies i was

747
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,840
particularly interested about the

748
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:11,440
aviation case because it's our newest

749
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:12,080
one

750
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:13,600
2020 was going to be the year we

751
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:15,600
collected tons of satellite aviation

752
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:16,159
data

753
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:17,600
and really got a feel for how it's used

754
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,840
in the industry and then

755
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:22,400
people stopped flying on airplanes the

756
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:23,919
coronavirus pandemic meant that the

757
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:25,280
amount of traffic we were getting in

758
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:25,840
april

759
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:27,760
was a tiny fraction of the amount we

760
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:28,960
were getting in february

761
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,480
and i was originally really frustrated

762
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:32,480
about this but then i realized there was

763
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:34,480
a bit of a silver lining here

764
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:36,720
you see back in february the traffic we

765
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,240
were getting had a lot of garbage

766
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:39,760
people browsing facebook on their flight

767
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:41,280
for example which isn't all that

768
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:42,240
interesting

769
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:44,080
but in april when the plane started

770
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:45,280
flying empty

771
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:47,440
the only traffic in these networks was

772
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,039
related to like the operation of the

773
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:50,799
airlines or the airplane it was just the

774
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:52,480
most interesting bits

775
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:54,640
and even now as traffic picks up the

776
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:55,679
sort of people flying

777
00:21:55,679 --> 00:21:57,280
aren't tourists they're people who have

778
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:58,880
important meetings or important business

779
00:21:58,880 --> 00:21:59,600
executives

780
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:00,960
that are leaking somewhat interesting

781
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:03,039
data in their own right

782
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:05,039
since we had this unique opportunity to

783
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:06,880
make airplane networks be quiet so we

784
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,559
could focus on what mattered

785
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:10,640
we wanted to test a theory that comes

786
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:12,240
from a researcher whose work i really

787
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,039
admire

788
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:15,039
ruben santamarta does a lot of satellite

789
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:16,640
communications research on terminal

790
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:18,320
hardware so i think satellite modems and

791
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:19,039
stuff

792
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:20,400
and he has this blog post from a little

793
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:21,840
while back where he looked at in-flight

794
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,200
entertainment systems

795
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,880
now we knew we were seeing traffic from

796
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,400
in-flight entertainment systems

797
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,760
and so this claim he makes in his

798
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:30,080
article intrigued us he posited that the

799
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:30,880
satcom's

800
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:33,440
side of this ife environment might cross

801
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:35,280
a historic red line that separates the

802
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:36,799
parts of the plane that keep you happy

803
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:37,600
and entertained

804
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:38,799
and the parts of the plane that keep it

805
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:40,000
in the sky and going in the right

806
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:40,960
direction

807
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,320
so we wanted to go through our traffic

808
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:44,400
captures and see if there was any data

809
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,159
that crossed this red line and proved

810
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:47,919
that systems on both sides

811
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:50,240
shared the same satellite feeds and we

812
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:51,760
would have missed it if it wasn't for

813
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:53,039
the pandemic

814
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:54,799
but we ended up catching on to something

815
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:56,720
that i'll call the loneliest efb

816
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,799
or electronic flight bag so an

817
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:00,720
electronic flight bag is a terminal in

818
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:01,600
the cockpit

819
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:02,880
that gives important information in the

820
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,559
pilot it's a lot like an actus terminal

821
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:06,400
but for airplanes it has navigational

822
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:07,039
information

823
00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:09,120
and weather updates and this particular

824
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:10,159
chinese airline

825
00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:12,159
had made a mistake someone fat fingered

826
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:14,640
a password and so it wasn't able to log

827
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:16,000
into the wireless network it was trying

828
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:16,880
to connect to

829
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,880
and so every query it send it was

830
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,799
getting bounced off of those satellite

831
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:22,799
dishes and back onto our interception

832
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:23,360
feed

833
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:24,880
and so we're able to fingerprint the

834
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:26,400
traffic patterns understand what the

835
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,760
internal apis were doing

836
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:29,360
and understand what sort of information

837
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:31,200
was being sent across the signal

838
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,640
based off of this we're able to verify

839
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,559
that other efb terminals on other

840
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:36,159
airplanes belonging to this airline

841
00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:37,679
were also operating in the satellite

842
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:39,440
space now

843
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:40,960
what this suggests is that at least in

844
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:42,880
this specific case a piece of flight

845
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,559
critical hardware is operating in the

846
00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:46,240
same underlying network

847
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:47,919
as the person who's four rows back

848
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:49,600
browsing instagram there might be a

849
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:50,000
firewall

850
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,440
in the plane to stop people from messing

851
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:53,360
around but at the satellite level it's

852
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:55,520
one in the same

853
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:57,120
another piece of airplane hardware we're

854
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:58,559
interested in is something called a

855
00:23:58,559 --> 00:23:59,440
femtocell

856
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:00,880
these are essentially miniature cell

857
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:02,559
towers that they put onto airplanes that

858
00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:03,919
you can use your cell phone like you

859
00:24:03,919 --> 00:24:05,120
were on the ground you know send and

860
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:07,360
receive text messages and so forth

861
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:09,120
and often you might connect to one of

862
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:10,720
these accidentally if you like forgot to

863
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:12,400
put your phone in airplane mode

864
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:13,600
and what we found is that the front end

865
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:15,440
of these is still fairly secure it uses

866
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:17,120
gsm or lte which have

867
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:18,640
some built-in security protections

868
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,159
although they may be imperfect

869
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:22,320
but the back end was being sent in clear

870
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:24,000
text over the satellite feed

871
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,760
and were able to intercept text messages

872
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:27,600
that were coming to customers on flights

873
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,039
who may have not even known that they

874
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:30,720
were connected to this cell tower

875
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,400
a great example of how bad this can get

876
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:33,840
is this intercept here

877
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:35,360
this is from a gentleman who received

878
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:36,960
his negative coronavirus test result

879
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:38,159
while he was in a flight

880
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:40,480
now that's a huge relief to anyone

881
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:42,080
sitting next to him on the airplane

882
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:43,600
but for the rest of us who care about

883
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,440
information security it's deeply

884
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:47,440
concerning to see sensitive medical data

885
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:49,200
shout across an entire continent in

886
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:51,679
clear text you might also imagine

887
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:53,600
if you use for example sms as a second

888
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:55,200
factor for authentication

889
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,799
how it could be used in a account

890
00:24:56,799 --> 00:24:59,360
hijacking attack

891
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:01,120
so we've talked a lot about kind of

892
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:02,799
passive eavesdropping attacks

893
00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:04,080
but one thing that i was curious about

894
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:05,360
is can we do anything active in these

895
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:06,880
networks we don't have any equipment to

896
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,480
transmit radio signals we don't have any

897
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:09,520
license to do that

898
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:11,679
but is there another way and we ended up

899
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:13,039
proving is that it's possible to

900
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:14,000
reliably engage

901
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,159
in tcp session hijacking attacks in some

902
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:17,279
of these networks

903
00:25:17,279 --> 00:25:19,840
tcp session hijacking is a fairly simple

904
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:21,840
cyber security attack you intercept tcp

905
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:22,640
sequence numbers

906
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:24,240
which allow you to impersonate the end

907
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:26,320
point of a tcp three-way handshake

908
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:27,840
and essentially play as a party to a

909
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:29,360
connection that you're not

910
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:31,360
we were able to actually do this against

911
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:33,200
our own connections to a device

912
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:35,279
inside a real satellite network although

913
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:36,559
we weren't able to test this in every

914
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:37,760
network because it's a little bit more

915
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:40,000
active and we had to do it responsibly

916
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,840
depending on the network configuration

917
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:43,760
an attacker can reliably hijack and

918
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:45,200
impersonate people who are on the other

919
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,799
side of that satellite hop

920
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:48,480
here's an example of how that might play

921
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:50,960
out so just like before we have someone

922
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:51,760
in ireland

923
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:53,600
but this time it's a maritime office

924
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:55,200
that wants to check a website that's

925
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,080
hosted

926
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:58,320
on the ship in the ocean and so what

927
00:25:58,320 --> 00:25:59,760
they'll do is they'll start a tcp

928
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:01,919
through a handshake with a syn message

929
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:03,679
and this syn message has a sequence

930
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:05,360
number attached that they'll beam up in

931
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:06,320
the space

932
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:07,520
and to prove your party to this

933
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:08,799
conversation you have to essentially

934
00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:10,960
know this randomly selected number

935
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:12,240
so you can prove that you got the first

936
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:14,080
part of this handshake the attacker has

937
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:15,440
no trouble knowing this it hits their

938
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:16,720
satellite dish just like it hits the

939
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:18,240
cargo vessel

940
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,600
but the attacker has a significant

941
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:21,520
advantage because in the next step where

942
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:22,720
they have to prove their knowledge of

943
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:23,760
this information

944
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:25,919
they can go much faster than that signal

945
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:27,039
over the space link

946
00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:28,320
this is because our attacker is

947
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,000
connected to terrestrial internet in

948
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,440
this specific case our attacker is

949
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:32,960
actually in a craw in ghana

950
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:34,880
which has an extremely fast backbone

951
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,559
linked to the uk and is a short hop from

952
00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:37,360
ireland

953
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:39,760
so 100 of the time they can get their

954
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:41,200
spoofed acknowledgement message

955
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:42,720
to the maritime office while the real

956
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:45,520
message is still in space

957
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:47,279
this causes the maritime office to start

958
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:48,559
a conversation

959
00:26:48,559 --> 00:26:50,320
with the attacker thinking they're

960
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:51,679
talking to the ship

961
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:53,120
that acknowledgement message from the

962
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:55,120
office will be dropped by the ship the

963
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:56,799
ship will think oh this is a glitch it's

964
00:26:56,799 --> 00:26:58,559
malicious and just ignore it

965
00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:01,279
but the attacker now has free reign to

966
00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:02,799
pretend like they're the vessel and send

967
00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:04,400
whatever information they want

968
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:07,279
to the maritime back office this shows

969
00:27:07,279 --> 00:27:08,400
how if you think about kind of the

970
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,000
physical characteristics of space

971
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,840
like the fact that orbit is far away and

972
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:12,880
there's a lot of latency in these

973
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:13,520
networks

974
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:15,039
you can come up with some pretty unique

975
00:27:15,039 --> 00:27:16,960
attacks that combine the knowledge you

976
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:17,840
get from space

977
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:19,279
with the access to the internet you have

978
00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:21,200
on the ground

979
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:23,279
so obviously this is research in real

980
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:25,440
world networks and so ethics and

981
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:26,880
legality is an important component of

982
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:29,039
doing it responsibly we were very

983
00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:29,600
careful

984
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:30,880
to adhere to all of our legal

985
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:32,880
obligations and go beyond that

986
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:34,399
in particular you may notice that i

987
00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:36,000
haven't named and shamed any companies

988
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:36,640
today

989
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:38,799
and that's a very conscious choice we

990
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:40,640
don't want this to be a report about

991
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:42,640
x cruise line is leaking your personal

992
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:44,159
information we want to talk about a

993
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:45,520
systemic issue that affects

994
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:47,200
almost every customer of satellite

995
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:49,120
geostationary broadband

996
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,799
we of course responsibly disclose these

997
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:52,480
vulnerabilities reaching out to some

998
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:54,240
companies as much as a year ago

999
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,760
as well as some of the customers who are

1000
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:57,760
most affected by these breaches

1001
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:59,039
and generally people were pretty

1002
00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:00,960
receptive we were able to talk to some

1003
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:02,399
cisos about the vulnerabilities and

1004
00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:03,679
they're at least aware of the risks

1005
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:04,799
although it's unclear what they've

1006
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:06,159
decided to change

1007
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:07,840
and we only had one company threaten to

1008
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:09,520
sue us which is pretty good for this

1009
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:11,600
kind of wide reaching systemic research

1010
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:13,200
we've also kind of explained to them why

1011
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,480
it's in the public interest and we think

1012
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:16,480
they're on our side now

1013
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:18,080
we got a huge boost to our disclosure

1014
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:19,360
effort actually thanks to the federal

1015
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:20,799
bureau of investigation

1016
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:22,320
who released this threat intelligence

1017
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:24,559
notification the interesting thing about

1018
00:28:24,559 --> 00:28:26,080
this notification which they sent to the

1019
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:27,600
maritime industry to describe our

1020
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:28,240
research

1021
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:30,080
was that it came out almost a month

1022
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,840
before our paper was publicly available

1023
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:32,880
online

1024
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:35,279
and yet it cited specific details from

1025
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:37,600
one chart in this pdf document

1026
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:39,120
now the only people with access to this

1027
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:41,360
document were academic peer reviewers

1028
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:42,880
and a handful of organizations we had

1029
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,399
responsibly disclosed to

1030
00:28:44,399 --> 00:28:45,679
so as a researcher it's a little

1031
00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:47,279
concerning how the fbi managed to get

1032
00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:48,880
their hands on this data

1033
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:50,320
but if you're ever curious about whether

1034
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:51,279
or not these threat intelligence

1035
00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:53,120
networks can provide something of value

1036
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:54,399
it's pretty clear that at least in this

1037
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:57,279
case the fbi is able to get a good scoop

1038
00:28:57,279 --> 00:28:59,120
so let's talk about mitigations and how

1039
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:00,960
we can defend against these sorts of

1040
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:01,760
attacks

1041
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:03,760
it's really tempting to say the

1042
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:05,520
satellite operators are just lazy and

1043
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:06,399
incompetent

1044
00:29:06,399 --> 00:29:08,080
they should just encrypt it and it'll

1045
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:10,399
all be better the reality is much more

1046
00:29:10,399 --> 00:29:11,440
complicated

1047
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:12,799
remember how i was talking about how

1048
00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:14,720
space is far away and the speed of light

1049
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:16,159
is only so fast

1050
00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:17,919
and that tcp three-way handshake we were

1051
00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:19,919
targeting it turns out tcp

1052
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:21,919
is really slow over those satellite

1053
00:29:21,919 --> 00:29:23,279
feeds because of all the hops you have

1054
00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:24,720
to make in the sky

1055
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:26,320
and so as a result satellite internet

1056
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:27,760
service providers have built a tool

1057
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:29,840
called the performance enhancing proxy

1058
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:31,600
which is essentially a benevolent man in

1059
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:32,960
the middle attacker

1060
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:34,960
it intercepts and kind of modifies your

1061
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:36,720
tcp sessions on both sides of the

1062
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:37,600
satellite link

1063
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:40,880
to make it feel fast unfortunately

1064
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:42,240
if you use standard end-to-end

1065
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:44,799
encryption like just installing a vpn

1066
00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:46,559
this will stop the isp from being able

1067
00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:48,000
to engage in that benevolent man in the

1068
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:48,799
middle attack

1069
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:50,240
and it will slow your satellite speeds

1070
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:52,000
to a crawl now

1071
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
in reality maybe you should just accept

1072
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,080
this right there's some data that's so

1073
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:57,919
sensitive that it should either be sent

1074
00:29:57,919 --> 00:30:00,159
encrypted or not sent at all

1075
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:02,640
that said for a lot of people it's not a

1076
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:03,760
performance trade-off

1077
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:05,440
for example with those pop emails where

1078
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:07,360
you're intercepting if you used a tls

1079
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:09,120
encrypted email client instead

1080
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:10,240
you wouldn't see a performance

1081
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:11,679
difference but your data would be

1082
00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:12,559
protected

1083
00:30:12,559 --> 00:30:14,559
and finally internet service providers

1084
00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:16,720
can make tiny tweaks to their peps

1085
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:18,640
that improve security against those tcp

1086
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:20,159
sequence hijacking attacks

1087
00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:21,600
by messing with the sequence numbers in

1088
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:22,960
those packets while they're messing with

1089
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:24,080
other things

1090
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:25,840
now we think some isps already do this

1091
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:27,200
probably accidentally

1092
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,880
but it definitely stops that specific

1093
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:31,360
attack in the longer run though

1094
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:33,360
this isn't quite as good as we'd like we

1095
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:35,200
want it to be intuitive and effortless

1096
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,880
to encrypt your traffic so we're

1097
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:39,039
building a tool that we call qpap

1098
00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:40,480
it's a combination of kind of a

1099
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:42,000
performance enhancing proxy and a

1100
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,399
traditional kind of tunneling vpn

1101
00:30:44,399 --> 00:30:46,320
and it uses the quick protocol which is

1102
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:48,720
a udp-based alternative to tcp

1103
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:50,960
that is encrypted by default and the

1104
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:52,559
basic idea here is that individual

1105
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:54,080
customers can protect their data over

1106
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:55,039
the satellite link

1107
00:30:55,039 --> 00:30:56,799
without sacrificing the performance of

1108
00:30:56,799 --> 00:30:58,960
their connections

1109
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:01,200
the idea of qpep is simple we wanted to

1110
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:02,799
build an open source tool this isn't a

1111
00:31:02,799 --> 00:31:04,159
commercial product we're not trying to

1112
00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:05,120
sell anything

1113
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:06,880
instead we want to build a tool so that

1114
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:08,240
people in the security community

1115
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:09,519
have a playground where they can start

1116
00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:11,440
to mess with these sorts of problems

1117
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:12,960
we include a bunch of like python

1118
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:14,559
libraries that you can have a simulated

1119
00:31:14,559 --> 00:31:16,159
test bed without having any satellite

1120
00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:17,200
equipment in your house

1121
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:18,559
just the ability to like run a docker

1122
00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:20,399
container and all the code is written in

1123
00:31:20,399 --> 00:31:21,360
python and go

1124
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:23,039
to make it accessible and easy to hack

1125
00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:24,880
on the end goal is really about

1126
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:25,440
empowering

1127
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:27,279
individuals to encrypt their satellite

1128
00:31:27,279 --> 00:31:29,279
traffic and make conscious choices about

1129
00:31:29,279 --> 00:31:31,679
how their data is being sent

1130
00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:32,720
if we look at just kind of the

1131
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:34,559
difference of using a bespoke tool like

1132
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:35,840
q pep on the right

1133
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:38,000
versus a very good but traditional vpn

1134
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,519
that doesn't think about satellites like

1135
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:40,960
openvpn on the left

1136
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:43,279
you can see why a customer would care

1137
00:31:43,279 --> 00:31:44,480
and you can also see why someone would

1138
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:46,320
be tempted to leave their protocols

1139
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:48,240
unencrypted because the performance

1140
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,080
difference is so enormous

1141
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:51,600
i think recognizing that when

1142
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:53,679
performance and privacy trade off

1143
00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:55,200
there are many people who will choose

1144
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:57,360
performance is an important step into

1145
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:59,039
figuring out how the security community

1146
00:31:59,039 --> 00:32:00,960
can provide solutions to the satcom's

1147
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,559
world and other communications

1148
00:32:02,559 --> 00:32:05,120
environments like it

1149
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:08,000
so to sum things up the basic idea of

1150
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,600
this talk is that satellite traffic

1151
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:10,159
today

1152
00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:11,679
can be intercepted by someone who's

1153
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:13,760
really far away when we talk about those

1154
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:15,600
these geo networks an attacker can be in

1155
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:16,799
a different country or a different

1156
00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:17,519
continent

1157
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:18,720
and still be listening to your

1158
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:20,799
communications yet customers of

1159
00:32:20,799 --> 00:32:22,559
satellite internet are not acting that

1160
00:32:22,559 --> 00:32:23,200
way

1161
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:24,960
from the biggest companies in the world

1162
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:26,880
to individuals in a coffee shop

1163
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,640
people are leaking deeply sensitive

1164
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:30,880
information over satellite feeds

1165
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:33,039
we think that this is solvable we

1166
00:32:33,039 --> 00:32:34,880
understand how these problems arose from

1167
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:36,399
performance considerations

1168
00:32:36,399 --> 00:32:37,919
and we think if we attack that

1169
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:39,840
underlying premise that performance and

1170
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:41,279
security have to trade off

1171
00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:44,000
in geostationary satcoms we can provide

1172
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,679
a solution as a security community

1173
00:32:45,679 --> 00:32:47,840
that fixes this traffic and is easily

1174
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:49,039
adoptable

1175
00:32:49,039 --> 00:32:51,279
so to sum things up i think the core

1176
00:32:51,279 --> 00:32:53,279
message of this talk is very simple

1177
00:32:53,279 --> 00:32:55,679
and that is that the next hop is unknown

1178
00:32:55,679 --> 00:32:57,919
the internet is a weird web of devices

1179
00:32:57,919 --> 00:32:58,799
and systems

1180
00:32:58,799 --> 00:33:00,000
that are connected in ways that you can

1181
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,840
never predict you might connect to a

1182
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:04,159
secure wi-fi hotspot or a cell tower

1183
00:33:04,159 --> 00:33:05,679
but the next hop could be a satellite

1184
00:33:05,679 --> 00:33:08,159
link or a wire-tapped ethernet cable

1185
00:33:08,159 --> 00:33:10,240
having the right the ability and the

1186
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:12,159
knowledge to encrypt your own data

1187
00:33:12,159 --> 00:33:14,640
and choose to do that is critical to

1188
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:16,640
protecting against this class of attack

1189
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:18,799
whatever domain you think about it in

1190
00:33:18,799 --> 00:33:20,080
thank you so much for listening to my

1191
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:20,960
presentation

1192
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:25,840
i'm happy to answer any questions

1193
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:41,760
oh cool um so

1194
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:45,039
yeah i guess one question

1195
00:33:45,039 --> 00:33:47,279
that came up that i thought was pretty

1196
00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:48,640
interesting

1197
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:51,440
is um a couple of people were kind of

1198
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:52,880
asking about the underlying equipment

1199
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:55,120
that we used and i would say

1200
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:56,960
that um we chose to use kind of

1201
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:58,720
commercial general purpose satellite

1202
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:00,159
equipment instead of software-defined

1203
00:34:00,159 --> 00:34:02,159
radios and stuff because the stuff

1204
00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:03,919
the underlying protocols that are used

1205
00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:05,360
are the same ones that you would

1206
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:08,079
expect to see on a television feed and

1207
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:08,560
so

1208
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:12,239
by kind of using the underlying

1209
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:13,599
tools that these c's are designed for

1210
00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:14,800
we're able to kind of get to the

1211
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:16,800
interesting bits a little bit faster

1212
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:19,359
which was really useful another

1213
00:34:19,359 --> 00:34:20,560
interesting question

1214
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:23,918
that i encountered um here

1215
00:34:23,918 --> 00:34:27,599
came from let me see um so there were a

1216
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:28,719
couple of people talking

1217
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:30,639
andrew here in particular talking about

1218
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:32,320
kind of the latency in these tcp

1219
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:32,960
networks

1220
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:34,800
and how easy it is to do session

1221
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:36,159
hijacking attacks and

1222
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:38,000
because geostationary orbit is so far

1223
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,359
away we're talking about 30 000

1224
00:34:39,359 --> 00:34:40,719
kilometers up

1225
00:34:40,719 --> 00:34:42,800
into the sky um you get quite a lot of

1226
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:44,320
time um your terrestrial connection

1227
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:45,599
might have like 70 milliseconds of

1228
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:46,320
latency

1229
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:47,679
where a satellite connection would have

1230
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:49,599
around 500 milliseconds of latency to

1231
00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:50,879
actually get that packet up in this

1232
00:34:50,879 --> 00:34:52,560
space and back and get a response back

1233
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:53,199
to you

1234
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:55,040
meaning that attacker can reliably win

1235
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:56,560
kind of these internet wide

1236
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:59,359
race condition scenarios um another

1237
00:34:59,359 --> 00:34:59,920
question

1238
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:02,640
that i had was kind of around whether or

1239
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:04,160
not it's possible to

1240
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:06,000
intercept like military satellites and

1241
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,200
stuff and um

1242
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:08,800
we encounter like a little bit of

1243
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:10,160
government traffic specifically there

1244
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:11,280
was a north african

1245
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:13,040
nation with an air force jet that we saw

1246
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:15,440
the traffic from but generally there are

1247
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:17,200
like premium services that are offered

1248
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:19,359
by some satellite isps that kind of

1249
00:35:19,359 --> 00:35:21,760
employ encryption protocols or military

1250
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:23,040
providers will have their own sort of

1251
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:24,720
black box encryption products

1252
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:26,240
that prevent these attacks so it's more

1253
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:27,839
the commercial side that we saw

1254
00:35:27,839 --> 00:35:29,359
but that doesn't necessarily mean that

1255
00:35:29,359 --> 00:35:30,720
the tools the military are using are

1256
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:32,240
fully secure just that we haven't really

1257
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:34,560
analyzed the security of them

1258
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:36,880
i guess if i were to answer one last

1259
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:37,760
question

1260
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,760
real quick um there's been some

1261
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:41,040
discussion about whether or not it's

1262
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:43,200
like patchable at the protocol layer

1263
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:44,640
if this is something that vsat providers

1264
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:45,839
could do in the same way that like cell

1265
00:35:45,839 --> 00:35:47,200
tower providers do

1266
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:48,800
and i think this is definitely an option

1267
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:50,000
but because of the way commercial

1268
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,040
incentives work

1269
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:53,359
a lot of satellite isps don't really

1270
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:54,560
feel the need

1271
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:56,400
to encrypt kind of their whole network

1272
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:57,920
especially that has even a small

1273
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:59,040
performance impact

1274
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:00,400
they'd rather say you know customers

1275
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:01,680
know their own risk so they should

1276
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:02,800
encrypt their data

1277
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:04,800
i just think that in reality customers

1278
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:06,320
pretty clearly don't seem to know their

1279
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:08,079
own risk

1280
00:36:08,079 --> 00:36:09,359
um so i'm going to quickly check if

1281
00:36:09,359 --> 00:36:11,440
there are any other questions oh yeah so

1282
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:13,520
um gsextract is not on my github right

1283
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:14,079
now

1284
00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:15,440
unfortunately we're still kind of going

1285
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:16,720
through a process to be sure we don't

1286
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:17,119
release

1287
00:36:17,119 --> 00:36:18,720
an attack tool into the wild before

1288
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:20,320
there are kind of mitigations in place

1289
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:22,160
to stop people from causing harm with it

1290
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:27,839
but i'm really hopeful it comes out soon

1291
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:30,560
and uh there were some questions about

1292
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:32,800
the frequency band um i think that ku

1293
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:34,240
band is not the only environment where

1294
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:34,960
this would apply

1295
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:37,119
i'd expect it to work in ka band and c

1296
00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:38,400
band communications

1297
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:40,160
from geo um but we haven't looked at

1298
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:41,440
those because we just didn't have

1299
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:42,960
the equipment on hand to do it um it

1300
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:44,000
could be pretty interesting to play

1301
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,200
around with that

1302
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:46,880
and in terms of low earth orbit i think

1303
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:48,560
that it's way easier for customers to

1304
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:50,320
use a vpn in leo

1305
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:52,560
um so my hope is that these attacks

1306
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:53,920
would be much harder to pull off it's

1307
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:55,520
also more complicated on the attacker

1308
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:56,480
side because you need

1309
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:57,839
a little bit more sophisticated work

1310
00:36:57,839 --> 00:36:59,359
with equipment especially if you don't

1311
00:36:59,359 --> 00:36:59,920
have

1312
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:01,280
the parts that are actually provided to

1313
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:04,800
you from the service provider

1314
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,880
so awesome thank you all so much for

1315
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:08,000
listening to this briefing

1316
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,160
i um really enjoyed doing this research

1317
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:11,359
and seeing all your questions in the

1318
00:37:11,359 --> 00:37:11,839
chat

1319
00:37:11,839 --> 00:37:13,440
if you have any other questions that i

1320
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:15,760
missed you can always email me my emails

1321
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:17,040
at the end of the slide deck there

1322
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:20,320
james.before cs that ox that act at uk

1323
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:22,000
or i'm on twitter at james before and

1324
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,839
i'd be happy to answer any questions

1325
00:37:23,839 --> 00:37:27,839
thank you so much
