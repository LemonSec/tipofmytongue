00:00:00,719 --> 00:00:02,960
good afternoon i'm michelle and i'm

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:04,080
really delighted to have this

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:06,000
opportunity to talk to you about edtech

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,839
the ultimate apt

5
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:11,040
um if during after the during the

6
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:13,440
talks you have any questions or you wish

7
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,759
to offer any collaboration because we do

8
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:17,680
really really want people to come and

9
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:19,199
help us and work

10
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:21,039
on the security and privacy issues that

11
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:22,480
we're going to talk about now

12
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:24,960
please do message or email me and we're

13
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:26,080
really happy to

14
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:29,119
talk to you and collaborate

15
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:31,119
the main aim of this talk hopefully for

16
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:33,040
the audience uh whoever you are whether

17
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:34,480
you're working on

18
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:37,920
or with uh ed tech platforms or whether

19
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,000
you're an interested party as a parent

20
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
or a student or somebody who knows what

21
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,200
somebody who is

22
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,840
then hopefully this talk will give you

23
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:46,879
the information

24
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:49,120
that you need to understand what the key

25
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:51,199
privacy and security issues are around

26
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:53,920
edtech and there are quite a few

27
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:57,360
and how you can help how you can ask the

28
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:58,559
right questions

29
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:01,359
and how you can when you're in the rooms

30
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:03,039
where things are being

31
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:05,360
onboarded or planned or developed how

32
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:07,200
you can ask those key questions and it's

33
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,680
really important to do so

34
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,920
also what i really want to say before i

35
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:13,680
start is that i'm not at any point

36
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:14,400
saying that

37
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,840
technology is bad i love it as somebody

38
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:19,439
who's worked in education for a long

39
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:20,080
time

40
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:23,119
we have seen how edtech has really

41
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:23,600
increased

42
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:26,479
our accessibility and our inclusion and

43
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:27,920
particularly now

44
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:30,079
with the pandemic we've seen the need

45
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:32,159
for remote learning

46
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:36,079
and online education online learning

47
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:38,079
when i did the cfp i didn't quite

48
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:41,040
realize how relevant it would become

49
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,439
so i'm glad for that it's made this talk

50
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:44,960
a little bit more relevant hopefully and

51
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,560
useful for you but it is a really

52
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:47,439
pressing issue

53
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:49,280
we do have a number of issues that we

54
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,119
need to resolve and we need to be aware

55
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:51,759
of

56
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:53,759
and i don't feel like we're having those

57
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:55,920
conversations

58
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,159
so

59
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:02,159
just a little bit one minute on me

60
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:04,159
briefly is

61
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:06,880
i have had around about 20 years on and

62
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,878
off in and out of education within

63
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:10,878
school public sector and outside in

64
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:12,720
security awareness working with

65
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,319
corporate organizations

66
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:16,959
i now work on digital resilience

67
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:18,800
specifically with young people and

68
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,360
parents offering them privacy advice

69
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:24,080
and how to stay safe online and set up

70
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:27,360
their home networks that kind of thing

71
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,800
i'm a really strong harm reduction

72
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,800
advocate and i really really feel

73
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,519
strongly about privacy i love privacy

74
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:35,760
i love the compliance side of things and

75
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:38,640
i love technology as well as i've said

76
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,480
i think the the blend of those

77
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,160
especially within education is really

78
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,239
something special and as long as we

79
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:47,680
respect that and we act

80
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,360
responsibly i think they're really

81
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:53,040
really good things that we can do

82
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:57,840
so the first thing that i want to say is

83
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:58,319
that

84
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:01,360
data we say often that it's like gold or

85
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,959
it's like oil but those aren't really

86
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:04,640
tangible things most of us will never

87
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:06,239
really touch data or gold

88
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:09,440
oil or gold sorry um when we say that

89
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,400
it's like plasma

90
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,319
or like blood i think a lot of us can

91
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:14,239
imagine it being extracted and we see

92
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:16,959
how infinitely renewable that source is

93
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:18,879
and it really it's personal it touches

94
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:20,400
home

95
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,440
the average student might start around

96
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,360
the world in education around the age of

97
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,440
three they might go into preschool they

98
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,680
might start being tested

99
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:33,200
data is going to be taken on them

100
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:36,159
and they're going to be profiled and

101
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:38,239
there is a really really rich resource

102
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:41,519
in education of data and it's valuable

103
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:44,080
and at any point it can be there's

104
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:46,560
there's constantly new people coming in

105
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,280
and new ways that we can measure them

106
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,239
and look at them

107
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:52,799
and profile them and i think we really

108
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:54,080
need to be aware

109
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:57,040
that when you have data it's like

110
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,799
throwing a pebble into a pond

111
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:00,239
that's the way i think of it that the

112
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:01,840
ripples go out

113
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,080
and one of the key issues and the key

114
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,840
harms that i think we need to really be

115
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:06,720
aware of

116
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:10,000
is looking at when something

117
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,159
happens so when a child goes in and

118
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:13,360
their homework

119
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:16,560
is put online or their achievement in

120
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,320
class or their behavior

121
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,918
is put online or even something as

122
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:22,240
simple as their home address

123
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:25,120
or their special educational needs data

124
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,639
very very simple things

125
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:28,000
that you might not think are very

126
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,160
important or very valuable

127
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:33,040
those form a picture and it ripples out

128
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,639
so a child who

129
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:36,960
is in um he's given some homework who

130
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:38,560
may not do it who maybe gets some

131
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,840
detention points

132
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:42,880
whose parents may not be engaged and

133
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,720
we're measuring all of this by the apps

134
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:47,199
that we that the schools might be using

135
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:48,880
this is all an appearance of that

136
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,080
student

137
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,759
and so we can measure from the

138
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:53,440
individual through to their family down

139
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,120
to their street down to their town and

140
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:57,120
even down to their geographical area so

141
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,880
at state level at national level

142
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:01,440
level at global level we are making

143
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:02,160
decisions

144
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,919
just like decisions have been made and

145
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:05,840
we know about this in insurance and

146
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,120
things like that

147
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,520
upon um whether you should invest in

148
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:10,800
certain areas

149
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,680
or whether you should open a youth

150
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,360
centre in there or whether your tutoring

151
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,039
company is going to

152
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:18,560
be able to earn a lot of money or

153
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,160
whether it's going to be worth opening

154
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,479
that summer camp in that area

155
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:24,320
and these are all um things that really

156
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,520
really matter

157
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:28,479
and they also matter to that individual

158
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:30,479
is going to matter once they get to

159
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:34,000
16 or 18 they'll probably have around a

160
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,759
million data points on them

161
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:37,680
which will affect whether or not they're

162
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,440
sent targeted mailings from certain

163
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,400
colleges

164
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,880
or whether or not even certain places

165
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,720
might send them out information about

166
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:47,440
internships

167
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,520
and i think people do really care about

168
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,759
privacy i don't believe that privacy is

169
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:52,000
ever

170
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,560
dead i do think consumers care about it

171
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,400
but i think it's extremely difficult to

172
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,240
care about something that you don't know

173
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:00,080
is being taken and i think when people

174
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,160
know that their data is being taken

175
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:06,160
they start to care a lot more

176
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:08,000
and leading on from this is the

177
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,160
accountability and transparency that

178
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,080
myself as somebody who works within an

179
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,080
educational setting has to have

180
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:16,639
i have to be 100 transparent and

181
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:18,160
accountable for every single thing that

182
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:18,800
i do

183
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,400
with the students within the rooms and

184
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,319
with their data

185
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:24,080
i'm not even allowed to come in and talk

186
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:26,000
to other students at other schools or go

187
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,520
and speak to the girl scouts or any

188
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,680
other group of students anywhere else

189
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,680
unless they've seen my um criminal

190
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,120
record check

191
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,039
and unless i can prove exactly what i

192
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:36,160
want to do

193
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,639
why i want to do it and what the reason

194
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:41,039
is that i want to do that for

195
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:43,919
and yet pretty much every week i speak

196
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:44,720
to schools

197
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:47,360
or parents who are just downloading or

198
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,360
paying for or even getting

199
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,759
apps and other software and things like

200
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:52,720
that free

201
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:55,599
even because they're nice and blinky and

202
00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:56,319
shiny

203
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:57,680
and they come through the door and there

204
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:01,120
is no accountability and transparency

205
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,280
often there is once you start asking the

206
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,160
questions

207
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,440
but you have to know whether or not

208
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:09,039
you're going to ask the right questions

209
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:12,880
um i was looking for some

210
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,720
really really nice information for you

211
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,639
some statistics and

212
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:19,440
last week a really lovely study came out

213
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:22,160
of barclays part of the pet symposium

214
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:25,360
and it was done by some really wonderful

215
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:28,240
scholars such as amit elazari and joel

216
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,360
reardon

217
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:32,560
and they have found that i won't read

218
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,319
the slide here but

219
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:37,840
nearly 20 of apps that they studied

220
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:41,199
within the us context that were targeted

221
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:42,560
at children and these aren't just

222
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,160
general apps these apps that are

223
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,400
targeted at parents and schools

224
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:49,360
had an sdk that wasn't copper compliant

225
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:49,680
so

226
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:54,240
even though the sdk itself had a

227
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,720
a setup where privacy could be done by

228
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,479
default and by design

229
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:01,360
those defaults and that design was not

230
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,000
used

231
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,800
and so very very important things like

232
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,240
location

233
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,160
and things like that or contact details

234
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,599
were being shared even just by

235
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:12,160
downloading the app before you can even

236
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:15,039
actually create an account or consent or

237
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:16,720
opt-in or opt-out of anything

238
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,960
and that is wrong there is no

239
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,080
accountability

240
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,400
and there is no transparency there and

241
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,759
so when you're asking

242
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:25,599
about these apps and when somebody comes

243
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:26,879
in and says hey we'd like to work with

244
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:28,639
you hey this is a really nice platform

245
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:29,840
hey this is free

246
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:32,159
the question is to ask all well what

247
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:34,240
happens to my data

248
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,399
why do you need this but we'll come back

249
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:38,000
to this

250
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,559
and again it's the trust is really

251
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:41,679
important

252
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:44,399
i think this is a really really critical

253
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:44,880
thing

254
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:47,120
that we need to understand and we need

255
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,080
to accept

256
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,880
that we are there as as educators as

257
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,160
people who look after the children

258
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,760
within educational context or even

259
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,200
within clubs

260
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,600
or anything that works with youth in

261
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,800
loco parentis

262
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,040
so where they put their children as they

263
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,880
cross the school gates

264
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:06,320
they are us they are our responsibility

265
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:10,000
and if we say to a parent download this

266
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,480
use this they will trust it if we say to

267
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,279
colleagues

268
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:15,200
this is now the platform that you are

269
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,399
going to use

270
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:19,200
for your registration for your behavior

271
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,160
for your class

272
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:23,040
seating plans for marking we're going to

273
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,320
use this to

274
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,240
to make sure all our students are going

275
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,240
to be registered by this software

276
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,080
all of this we assume that it's going to

277
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,920
be trusted and let's remember as well

278
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,760
the teachers educators

279
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:36,240
nobody's stupid but it's not like if you

280
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,160
work at netflix or google where maybe

281
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,839
you get your first week is on boarding

282
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:41,360
and you get infinite power points and

283
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,040
infinite training

284
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,360
and and there's lots and lots of kind of

285
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,720
compliance things and

286
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:49,120
and really the level of understanding

287
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,720
that you're expected to have might be

288
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,480
fairly high

289
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:55,519
we get things thrown into schools

290
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:57,839
where quite a lot of schools you know

291
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:00,800
you're barely even using email

292
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,120
or they're still using paper to do a lot

293
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,279
of things and yet you have these

294
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:07,120
apps which are doing other things in

295
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,800
which are very very complex

296
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,480
and maybe people are assuming that

297
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,600
they've been checked and they're

298
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,600
completely safe

299
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,040
i was going to print this out for you

300
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:17,279
and do a really nice graphic

301
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:18,959
unfortunately because of the pandemic

302
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:21,279
ink and paper are quite hard to come by

303
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:22,880
so you'll just have to take my word for

304
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,399
it that the average

305
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:26,079
terms and conditions for education apps

306
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:27,360
and that's whether you're a parent or

307
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,800
whether you're a school looking through

308
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,800
is around five pages and nobody's going

309
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,480
to read that even i don't read all

310
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:33,120
through it

311
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:36,399
okay so it's just

312
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:39,279
not um it's not fair to be taking things

313
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:40,399
into schools

314
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:43,680
and and kind of having them shed out

315
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:46,800
when they're really really not

316
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,640
um when they're very opaque when they're

317
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:49,839
not transparent and they're not

318
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:51,440
responsibly done

319
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:53,200
it's a really really big responsibility

320
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,120
and me myself in my role

321
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:57,279
i feel very responsible if i suggest if

322
00:10:57,279 --> 00:10:58,800
i endorse an

323
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:01,440
app or some software or a company i do

324
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:01,839
that

325
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:03,279
having thought about it very very

326
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:06,959
carefully and ask the right questions

327
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,440
schools are catalysts for inequality as

328
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,480
well

329
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,079
i have just said that we are very

330
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:16,160
accountable and transparent but let's

331
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:18,000
not lie let's not pretend

332
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,680
especially within the current context of

333
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,040
everything else that's going on

334
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:24,160
in 2020 that everybody within schools

335
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,160
is aware of their own bias that

336
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:28,160
everybody is anti-racist that everybody

337
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:29,519
is completely fair

338
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:30,959
i've heard it said that high school days

339
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:32,959
are the best days of your life

340
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:34,399
i think sometimes that's a little bit

341
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:36,240
rose tinted but i think most of us if

342
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,920
we're really honest with ourselves we'll

343
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,519
say we'll remember that school was quite

344
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:40,079
unfair

345
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:41,839
we'll remember maybe things that happen

346
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:44,560
to us and i know that from speaking from

347
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:45,839
parents especially parents with

348
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:47,120
marginalized groups

349
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:49,680
that they feel this inequality today

350
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,760
right now their injustice is going on

351
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:52,560
and so

352
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,480
within any organization where there is

353
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,680
power

354
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,839
be it the police or anything and

355
00:11:57,839 --> 00:11:58,880
teaching is the same

356
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:01,279
there are going to be opportunities for

357
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:02,639
people to

358
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:05,279
kind of abuse that power i'm not trying

359
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:06,160
to suggest

360
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:08,160
that teachers in schools are evil or the

361
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,279
edtech is evil

362
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:10,959
but what i'm saying is we have to be

363
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:12,639
aware that we're not and be

364
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:14,560
mindful that we're not compounding

365
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:17,519
layers of inequality and injustice

366
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:20,800
via technology

367
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,519
the other thing we need to be aware of

368
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:24,480
and this is something that chris

369
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,440
gilliard has

370
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:27,760
or hypervisible on twitter has done

371
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:29,360
quite a lot of work on he coined the

372
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,680
phrase digital redlining

373
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:33,279
which is we we're aware of what

374
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:34,880
redlining is within the financial

375
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:35,680
services

376
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:37,440
but redlining particularly and

377
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,959
especially in the usa

378
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:41,519
there are around 25 states where you

379
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:43,680
cannot get municipal internet because of

380
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,279
laws that were passed to present

381
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:46,560
prevent that and those who should do

382
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:48,240
that entirely to do with corporate

383
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,040
interests

384
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:51,760
and if you listen to podcast like the

385
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,920
1619 podcast and others

386
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:56,000
you'll find out the just the history of

387
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,680
that and where it comes from

388
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:59,600
and so when we are talking about the

389
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,519
ripple effect of

390
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:05,120
um of an individual's data being

391
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:07,200
used and interpreted let's not forget

392
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,959
that you know just because if we're

393
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:10,320
measuring engagement

394
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,399
or whether or not homework was done not

395
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:13,839
only does that assume

396
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:15,760
that the platform itself was working and

397
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,680
we'll come to this later on as well

398
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:19,839
when they don't always work it also

399
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:22,079
assumes that everybody has a fair access

400
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:24,959
to that technology if the student is

401
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:26,800
sharing a device and often just one

402
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,320
mobile device

403
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,320
and it's often android on a lot of

404
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,240
platforms only work with ios or it's a

405
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:33,279
little bit

406
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:36,959
it's not always you know equal and level

407
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:38,800
they might be doing the work they might

408
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,639
be super engaged they might be super

409
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:42,399
determined and really really want to get

410
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:44,079
on that family might really really care

411
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:45,920
about the education of their child

412
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,920
but if they can't get onto the internet

413
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:49,680
if they don't have wi-fi

414
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:52,560
these are all other issues and we'll

415
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:53,920
come on we'll mention this again when we

416
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:56,240
come on to talk about educat

417
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:59,839
exam proctoring so

418
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:01,760
here's the main part now this is not an

419
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:03,519
exhaustive list because it will probably

420
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:06,320
run if i put every single edtech

421
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:09,440
or education linked

422
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,760
platform up here we'd run to around five

423
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,360
or six slides and

424
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:15,920
certainly if i was to show you the third

425
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:18,320
parties who some of these platforms work

426
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,920
with

427
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,920
regardless of consent of users we'd

428
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,120
probably run into

429
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:26,320
an hour talk and about 50 slides because

430
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:29,760
often there are around 200 third parties

431
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,279
that these apps are sharing your

432
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:32,959
information with

433
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:35,279
now on the left hand side of the slide

434
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:36,320
i've put the

435
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:40,320
platforms which are pretty much all

436
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,880
aimed at young people and schools not

437
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,399
exclusively but

438
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:46,000
pretty much that when they were designed

439
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,440
they were designed with young people in

440
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,079
mind

441
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:50,079
so perhaps they're little bits more

442
00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:52,160
structured a little a little bit

443
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:55,360
i'll say inverted commas safer

444
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:58,639
in the middle we are looking at the

445
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:00,720
platforms which work with schools but

446
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:01,839
also outside

447
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:03,760
and notably often some of them with

448
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:05,760
prisons

449
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:08,160
and on the right hand side we have the

450
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:09,360
platforms where

451
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,839
there was absolutely no desire or design

452
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:13,839
to go into education but particularly

453
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:16,880
with the pandemic they have moved into

454
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:19,199
education and there are issues with that

455
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:20,320
too

456
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:23,440
so let me explain to you

457
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,519
why the particularly on the right hand

458
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:27,279
side there are some problems we'll start

459
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:28,639
there

460
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:31,360
so when you have i'm not going to bash

461
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:32,639
zoom we're all aware of

462
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:35,839
um issues and and things that have that

463
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:36,880
have

464
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:40,240
transpired but the problem comes again

465
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,600
with the accountability and the

466
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,440
transparency and

467
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:46,320
also you have to ask yourself why are

468
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,079
people in education

469
00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:51,199
why are there so many of these platforms

470
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:52,480
in these organizations

471
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:54,160
why they why are they in education

472
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:56,160
because when i say i'm a teacher i've

473
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:57,519
spent 20 odd years

474
00:15:57,519 --> 00:15:59,759
in education i'm sure there were two

475
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:01,360
things you might have been thinking

476
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,199
wow i bet her holidays are great and

477
00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:04,720
that's true but also

478
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:07,920
wow she probably doesn't earn very much

479
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:09,920
if i say i work in software development

480
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,199
or i'm an attorney

481
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:12,480
you're probably going to think about

482
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:15,040
stock vests and bonuses and high

483
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,000
salaries

484
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
when you think about education we know

485
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,240
that we don't go into it for the money

486
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:22,880
there is no money to be made if you are

487
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:23,440
working

488
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:27,360
within education um so i could earn

489
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,440
a lot more if i went to work probably

490
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:30,959
for one of these platforms

491
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:35,120
um and so this is the key point here as

492
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,959
well where are they getting their money

493
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:37,440
from

494
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,040
and it's the third parties a lot of the

495
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:41,040
time or it's from

496
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:45,040
just demanding extra amounts of money

497
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:46,079
from

498
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:48,720
different institutions but i don't think

499
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,079
they're getting that from the schools

500
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:52,480
because even if you had a contract with

501
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,320
every school in america which is highly

502
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:55,519
unlikely

503
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:57,440
but even if you did you're not going to

504
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:59,759
get hundreds of thousands out of those

505
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:01,759
schools

506
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:04,319
so we need to ask why why are you in

507
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:06,400
here why are you what's your motivation

508
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,720
um and if you're giving us something for

509
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:09,520
free

510
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:12,720
in a year's time in in six months time

511
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,400
are you going to expect us to pay for

512
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,760
that

513
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:17,359
and i know this because i've worked

514
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:18,880
outside of education but

515
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:21,119
parallel and with non-profits and other

516
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:22,400
companies

517
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:25,520
with america and in within the uk

518
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:28,160
and i have seen how they will put things

519
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,520
in for free

520
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:31,520
and then after a year there'll be a

521
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:32,960
payment expected

522
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:35,280
i have also seen how within and this

523
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,679
comes back to the trust again

524
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:39,200
i've walked into schools as a

525
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,600
representative of a non-profit or an

526
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,039
organization that's working with a

527
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:43,919
school

528
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:45,760
and asked to speak to the principal

529
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,360
because the paperwork hasn't been

530
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:49,440
done properly and the principal hasn't

531
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,039
even been aware that we were working

532
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:51,760
with those

533
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,200
with those students and often we've

534
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:55,200
worked across schools without

535
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,440
the principal ever knowing that we had

536
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:58,559
actual hardware

537
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:00,400
in schools and that their students were

538
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,679
talking often

539
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:04,480
or working with outside people in other

540
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:06,080
companies

541
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:08,000
now happily none of that's ever meant

542
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,520
that anything really really bad has

543
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:10,080
happened

544
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:12,559
but again with the trust if you go in

545
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:14,480
and you say to teachers or education

546
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:15,600
boards

547
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,679
or local authorities i'm coming in i can

548
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:19,200
do this for you

549
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,960
there's a real responsibility there you

550
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,799
have to be really open and to do the

551
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:23,600
best you can

552
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:26,240
and i'm afraid that you leave your you

553
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:27,520
leave educators

554
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:31,039
and students and parents open to harm

555
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:32,880
when you don't do when you just go in

556
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,880
and think that you can walk in and do

557
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:35,360
things

558
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:37,120
so for instance with teams or zoom we've

559
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:38,640
seen because they weren't originally

560
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,880
specifically designed for schools

561
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:42,160
that there were loopholes there were

562
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:44,160
issues and because it's kids

563
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:46,160
people will it attracts the worst type

564
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,840
of people people will do whatever they

565
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:50,320
can to try and do shock or

566
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:54,000
or harm and little things like teams for

567
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,039
instance if you

568
00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:58,640
set up teams and you work

569
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:03,039
i don't know soft bank or somewhere

570
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:05,360
and you want to share your staff meeting

571
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:07,120
just with the organization or with your

572
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:09,039
community or whatever else that's fine

573
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:10,320
but that doesn't work like that for

574
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:12,400
schools if a group of teachers

575
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,559
save their minutes of their video of

576
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:16,640
their meeting at the moment

577
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:18,080
and they're not careful that means the

578
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:20,720
students and the and the parents

579
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:23,120
who have access to that portal can also

580
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,360
see that meeting recorded so

581
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:27,200
there are little things that just don't

582
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,200
work in

583
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:32,320
in the education world that do work for

584
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:34,720
your corporate world

585
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,799
in the middle i really really want us to

586
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:37,919
talk about this because this is one of

587
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:39,280
the ways that you can help and we will

588
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:40,640
look at this at the end of the talk

589
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:41,600
shortly

590
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:43,280
is the proctoring software and the

591
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:46,400
surveillance software

592
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,080
we have a number of issues with

593
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:50,240
biometrics in schools and biometrics

594
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:52,480
basically have no legitimate place it's

595
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:53,440
not proportional

596
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,360
it's not legitimate and that's the same

597
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,760
for copper or gdpr or any of these other

598
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:00,880
regulations or guidelines that we have

599
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:04,159
or legislation there is absolutely no

600
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:05,120
reason why

601
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:08,480
a child needs to have their biometrics

602
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,080
taken so whether it's your

603
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:12,000
thumbprint or fingerprints who pay for

604
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,280
your

605
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:16,080
your food in the canteen or whether it's

606
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:19,039
now with the pandemic your face scan

607
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:21,039
to see if your you belong in the

608
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:23,039
building or your temperature or anything

609
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:24,559
else like that it doesn't belong

610
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:26,159
i can understand why if you work for the

611
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:28,480
fbi you might need to have your face

612
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:30,000
scanned or your biometrics taken

613
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,960
to go into schools no it doesn't belong

614
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,000
and again we have that

615
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,400
position of trust that in loca parentis

616
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,480
schools and exams as well

617
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,400
are rights of passage we can't escape

618
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,240
them even if you're home schooled and we

619
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:43,679
may well have a large amount of people

620
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:45,440
who are homeschooled to avoid this kind

621
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:47,120
of harm

622
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,840
when you need to go for proctored exams

623
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:51,039
you're still going to come up against

624
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:52,880
this biometric

625
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:56,960
or ai as well which is used

626
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,640
and it's really harmful and again it

627
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:01,600
compounds like i said with

628
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:04,960
school being a catalyst for inequality

629
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:07,280
if you are marked as being somebody

630
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:09,600
constantly who doesn't belong if the

631
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,440
facial recognition software and the

632
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:13,039
temperature scan can't

633
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:15,120
recognize your skin or it considers you

634
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:16,960
when you're taking a proctored exam

635
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:18,880
to be doing something that's out of the

636
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:21,200
ordinary it will fail you

637
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:23,440
and that's fine if you're an affluent

638
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:24,640
family in connecticut

639
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:28,000
or california and you have an education

640
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,600
system behind you

641
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,840
or money behind you and you can and they

642
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:33,360
say you failed this exam you have to

643
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:34,080
appeal

644
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,679
and you appeal that you're probably

645
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:37,679
going to be successful

646
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:39,520
and you can probably do it again but i

647
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:41,520
know myself and i think a lot of us are

648
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:42,960
going to find this when we're going

649
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,880
through prompted exams

650
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:48,000
i had one very recently where the

651
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,760
the software started i don't believe it

652
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:51,840
was even prompted and then it crashed

653
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:53,600
and it took me two and a half hours to

654
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:55,440
successfully log out and it's only

655
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,039
because i had a personal connection at

656
00:21:57,039 --> 00:21:57,600
the

657
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,600
one of the companies that i was able to

658
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,600
get a voucher to redo that exam

659
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:04,240
within about three hours whereas if i'm

660
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:05,600
somewhere where has again with the

661
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,200
redlining if i'm somewhere that doesn't

662
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:07,520
have

663
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:10,000
reliable access to the internet if i had

664
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:10,640
to

665
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:12,799
go to extreme lengths to get a quiet

666
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:15,360
room and good internet even if i paid to

667
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:17,200
get that really solid internet to do

668
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:17,600
that

669
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:20,240
two hour exam or whatever else that's

670
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:21,760
really going to affect me especially if

671
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:23,440
i'm supposed to take it to then get the

672
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:26,159
internship to get the visa to get the

673
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:29,520
um the scholarship or whatever else or

674
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:31,360
to get the job it really really affects

675
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:33,600
people these are high-stakes games this

676
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,120
isn't just you know a case of oh i

677
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:36,480
couldn't submit my homework

678
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:39,440
never mind or um the platform didn't

679
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:40,640
work

680
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,159
and we'll come to that so really one of

681
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:43,840
the biggest things i would say is this

682
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:45,679
is a real issue for us within

683
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:49,200
education um the other side of things as

684
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:49,919
well

685
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:52,000
i mentioned briefly with the redlining

686
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,080
as well about how often these platforms

687
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:56,960
don't work we've had issues with um

688
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,159
pearson and other

689
00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:00,000
lots of these other apps which are up

690
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,760
where there's incorrect content where

691
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:03,440
things don't work where you will set

692
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:05,039
work for a group and actually half of

693
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:06,000
them can't see it

694
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,520
and that's probably okay if you're

695
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:09,039
dealing with people in person but when

696
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:10,320
you're dealing with a massive course

697
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:12,080
where you might have thousands of people

698
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:13,919
they might not all be able to reach you

699
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:15,679
or you might not believe them

700
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:17,919
okay because for me often as somebody

701
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:19,679
who works with an education i'll think

702
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:21,039
that something has been set that

703
00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:22,320
something's available

704
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:24,799
but i'll be told by parents and students

705
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:26,159
that it's not the case

706
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:27,919
and again in tech we have this issue

707
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:30,880
where we've you know pushed people away

708
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,720
and people won't complain to us i often

709
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:34,320
say to parents and students well did you

710
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:35,840
complain did you raise a ticket did you

711
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:37,120
flag it and they'll say oh no i just

712
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:38,480
bought a new device or i just

713
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:41,600
i just i just don't use it so we people

714
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,520
will feel stupid or they will replace a

715
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:44,080
device

716
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:46,960
rather than report a complaint or report

717
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:49,360
an issue and that has really really big

718
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:51,440
really kind of big ramifications further

719
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:52,559
down the line because

720
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:53,919
the developers aren't aware that there's

721
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:55,600
the problem even if they are

722
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:59,199
altruistic and want to help

723
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:04,799
so everything's gone sorry that's gone

724
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:07,120
okay very very quickly as well i would

725
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:08,559
like us to denormalize

726
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:10,400
the use of facebook i really like this

727
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:12,640
photo because it shows if you think of a

728
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:15,279
student here instead of mark

729
00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:16,960
that's kind of like the student in front

730
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:18,480
of all the data brokers and they're not

731
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,240
even aware that they're watching

732
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:23,440
they're being watched um but we i'm not

733
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,120
against as a harm reduction advocate

734
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:25,600
having

735
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:28,080
face a facebook presence as a landing

736
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:29,679
page because it means people can find

737
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:31,039
you and navigate to you

738
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:34,400
but we should not be pushing um students

739
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:36,240
and parents towards private facebook

740
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:37,840
groups or even towards creating an

741
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:38,559
account on

742
00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:41,760
on harmful platforms let's be honest

743
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:44,400
which also share their data if you want

744
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:45,440
a facebook

745
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:47,679
site for your school or the school that

746
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:48,640
you work with fine

747
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,400
but then make sure that the information

748
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,080
is available free and that people can

749
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:53,520
interact anonymously

750
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:55,840
and confidentially rather than having to

751
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:57,760
create an account

752
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:59,840
just to access information that's really

753
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:01,520
important it's not

754
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:05,120
equal so and also it's not

755
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:08,080
right because my daughter was told to

756
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:09,279
create an account

757
00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:11,279
several times by her school so that she

758
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:13,440
on facebook that she could access

759
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,840
information for her year group and she's

760
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:16,720
only 12

761
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:18,880
so that's below the terms and conditions

762
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:19,840
of the age

763
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:20,960
in the terms and conditions that

764
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:23,919
facebook suggests

765
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:28,159
so how can i make a difference you ask

766
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:30,559
why you ask how and you ask what for

767
00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:32,240
you say why do you need why do we need

768
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:33,919
this platform you say how are they going

769
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:34,880
to be operating

770
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:37,360
and you ask them what for what's it

771
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:38,720
going to do for us

772
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:41,520
and how long for where is the data going

773
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:42,400
to go

774
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,720
no is also a complete sentence i want to

775
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,480
opt out or i don't want to use this or

776
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:48,320
we shouldn't be using biometrics

777
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:50,240
the use of biometrics in schools for

778
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:51,840
instance for that like i've said for the

779
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:52,880
canteens

780
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:55,760
there should be other options as well um

781
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:56,480
nobody

782
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,799
um i've been all around mansonview and i

783
00:25:58,799 --> 00:25:59,520
have never

784
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:01,520
i think i've ever actually seen could be

785
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:03,200
corrected on this but i think i've ever

786
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:04,720
seen anybody even in google use a

787
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:06,559
biometric to pay for them to use their

788
00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:07,840
food

789
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:10,480
but we ask schools to do it that's not

790
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:11,760
fair for those people who are working

791
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:12,640
outside of

792
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:14,960
banking who maybe have an immigration

793
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:16,240
status that

794
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:17,919
means that they're not able to access

795
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:19,840
that so if you're going to do that

796
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:22,559
then you should have another system i

797
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:24,159
understand the need for cashless within

798
00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:26,880
the pandemic but really biometrics

799
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:29,120
proctoring all of these kind of things

800
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:30,720
no we need to say no

801
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:33,679
and we need to do it now we also need to

802
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:35,279
involve educators

803
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:36,880
in every single decision and every

804
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:38,559
single development that's just not

805
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:39,200
happening

806
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:41,039
it's really really surprising to me when

807
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:42,880
i hear pete and it's lovely when i hear

808
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:43,679
people say

809
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:45,200
oh we're going to work with educators

810
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:46,720
we're going to talk to people

811
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:48,080
but that shouldn't just mean people

812
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:51,200
who've gone through the apple or google

813
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:53,600
educator badge system which actually

814
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:54,720
doesn't talk about

815
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:57,520
privacy or security at all all it does

816
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:59,279
is ask you if you can use google slides

817
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:00,320
and things like that

818
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:02,960
not denigrating it as a level or a badge

819
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,400
but i'm saying that they don't talk

820
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:05,760
about the things or address the things

821
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:09,200
that we really need to be looking at

822
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:11,360
and for the children i get very

823
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:13,120
suspicious and worried when i hear this

824
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:14,960
because i've heard even in the uk the

825
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:16,799
nspcc say this and then they start

826
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:18,320
talking about end-to-end encryption

827
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:19,679
being really bad

828
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:22,320
it's not spelt surveillance we should

829
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:23,840
not put

830
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:26,799
police style software or platforms or

831
00:27:26,799 --> 00:27:28,159
anything

832
00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:30,799
into education it just doesn't belong

833
00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:31,360
okay

834
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:32,960
for the children means we care for them

835
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:34,480
we look after them we look after their

836
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:35,120
data

837
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:36,720
and we educate them and one of the

838
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,559
biggest things we can do is the digital

839
00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:40,399
resilient stuff is teaching them about

840
00:27:40,399 --> 00:27:42,080
their rights it's teaching them about

841
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:42,559
what's

842
00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:45,039
known about them and how they can opt in

843
00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:46,720
or opt out

844
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:48,399
and it's teaching them that kind of

845
00:27:48,399 --> 00:27:50,880
resilience it's not teaching them to go

846
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:52,799
into schools where they're going to be

847
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:55,600
um bullied and surveyed in buildings

848
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:57,760
that basically look a lot like prisons

849
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:59,760
um and however they might have facial

850
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:02,000
surveillance facial recognition

851
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,760
biometrics to get in the building or pay

852
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:05,039
for something as basic

853
00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:07,600
human rights as food or water and where

854
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:09,760
they then might have to take exams

855
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:12,159
where they will have to wait five to

856
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:14,399
seven days for ai to go through that

857
00:28:14,399 --> 00:28:16,080
recording of that exam

858
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:19,279
and decide whether or not they um they

859
00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:20,799
behaved adequately

860
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:22,799
and let's not forget as well looking

861
00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:23,840
around a room

862
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:26,240
with a proctoring software isn't just to

863
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,080
see if you've got note cards or anything

864
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:29,760
else it's also to see the kind of things

865
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:30,960
you've got on your walls

866
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,559
it's to see who else might be in that

867
00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:34,000
room with you

868
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,520
there's a lot of information that you

869
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:37,760
can get on somebody's bedroom or lounge

870
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:39,679
or or the room that they're in

871
00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:40,960
and that's just something we need to

872
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:43,120
protect everybody from and i really

873
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:46,559
really feel strongly about this

874
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:49,120
these are just a few references as well

875
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:50,480
that i hope you'll find

876
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:53,279
useful the qr code that was on the front

877
00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:55,039
slide is here as well where there'll be

878
00:28:55,039 --> 00:28:56,399
a transcript of the

879
00:28:56,399 --> 00:28:59,679
talk and also

880
00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:02,240
links to further resources that i also

881
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,760
update fairly regularly

882
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:05,200
thank you and if you have any questions

883
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:08,880
i'd love to answer them
