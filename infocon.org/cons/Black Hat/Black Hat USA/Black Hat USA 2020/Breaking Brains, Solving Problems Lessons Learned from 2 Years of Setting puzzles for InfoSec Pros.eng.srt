and i am a puzzle addict which is what

17
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:46,719
i'm going to talk to you about today

18
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:49,800
before we get started if you go to

26
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:04,720
not going to be a big prize i'll tell

27
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:06,240
you in advance but you will get

28
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:09,040
a prize and some kudos as well do feel

29
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:11,119
free to make a start during the talk if

30
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:12,640
you find your mind wandering a little

31
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,320
bit as we'll see that can be

32
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:18,158
a good approach to problem solving

33
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:21,040
so in this talk we're going to look at

34
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:22,960
some processes underpinning problem

35
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:23,920
solving

36
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:26,640
the roles of expertise and bias in those

37
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:29,119
processes and problems often generally

38
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:31,920
some strategies for improvement problem

39
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,680
solving as applied to infosec

40
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:34,799
specifically

41
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:37,360
the puzzle program that i run at pwc and

42
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:39,200
then some tips and resources

43
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,520
for creating your own puzzle program in

44
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:44,640
your organization as well

45
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:48,000
so how problem solving works really

46
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,079
all higher level cognition is problem

47
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:51,759
solving to some extent you have

48
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:54,079
some desired end state that you want to

49
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:56,000
get to and in order to get to that end

50
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,200
state you have to solve

51
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,880
problems they may be fairly simple they

52
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,640
may be very complex

53
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,960
and really problem solving is any

54
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,479
activation of concepts

55
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:07,759
in the brain to access further concepts

56
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:09,840
in terms of the brain itself there are a

57
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,520
number of regions associated with

58
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,480
problem solving

59
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:15,520
uh mostly the prefrontal cortex but um

60
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,520
other areas as well and there are

61
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,120
specific regions of the brain which

62
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:19,920
activate

63
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,440
when proper solving is complete that

64
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,599
kind of aha moment when you

65
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:27,040
get the solution and we know that when

66
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:27,599
people

67
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:30,160
try to solve problems there is some form

68
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,000
of abstract representation there's the

69
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:32,560
creation

70
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,879
of mental structures in the mind but the

71
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:36,560
exact mechanisms behind that

72
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:40,080
are not clear it's a bit of a mystery

73
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,120
when it comes to problem solving

74
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,959
particularly with what are called

75
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:46,959
knowledge lean problems which is where

76
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:48,239
you don't need information

77
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:51,360
outside of the puzzle pretext the puzzle

78
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,120
stimulus itself

79
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,040
there are two steps understanding and

80
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,319
searching

81
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:59,440
understanding involves assimilating the

82
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:00,239
stimulus

83
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:02,159
of a puzzle so understanding what it is

84
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:03,440
you're being asked to do and how that's

85
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,239
presented

86
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:05,920
and then forming mental structures to

87
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,519
represent that problem

88
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:09,120
and that can involve a variety of

89
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,360
perceptual processes depending on the

90
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:11,920
media

91
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:14,480
in which the puzzle is presented and

92
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:15,760
then there's searching

93
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,519
so searching is actually finding or

94
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:20,159
calculating a solution

95
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:22,239
um following that understanding of phase

96
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:24,319
and and the process of problem solving

97
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:26,480
is usually a blend of those two things

98
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,879
and it may be a kind of circular process

99
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:30,640
so it's not necessarily

100
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,799
linear it may go back and forth between

101
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:35,680
those two phases

102
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:41,120
so when solving a problem

103
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,280
there is first a definition of a problem

104
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,480
space

105
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,080
and that's the diagram you see here on

106
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,599
the top right an

107
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:50,480
initial problem state is defined you

108
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:53,040
have various operators which can change

109
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:55,599
the state and they may be explicitly

110
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:57,040
given or there may be things that you

111
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:57,920
have to

112
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:01,920
deduce or induce and then you test if

113
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,680
the new state once you've applied those

114
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,519
operators

115
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:08,879
resembles or is the desired

116
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:12,080
solution the desired end state

117
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,519
and there are various strategies you can

118
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:15,120
use when problem solving i've put some

119
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,880
of them here there are others

120
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,399
but these tend to be the most common or

121
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:20,639
the most well-known proceed strategies

122
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:22,720
which is simply a linear

123
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,360
process choosing an operator testing if

124
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,720
it affects the state and whether that's

125
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:27,600
a solution

126
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,000
and then repeating backward chaining

127
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,600
where you start at the solution

128
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,000
if it's known and try and work out how

129
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,560
to get to that in-state

130
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,400
sub-goaling this is where you choose an

131
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,560
operator you try and make it fit

132
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:43,440
if it doesn't fit you try it and make it

133
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:44,479
fit

134
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:47,360
so that becomes a sub goal to the the

135
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,280
end goal of getting to that end state

136
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:50,720
so an example of that applied to

137
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,800
security would be if you're a pen tester

138
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:56,080
testing a web app you might want to try

139
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:59,040
uh sql queries or cross-site scripting

140
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,560
and there might be a web application

141
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,199
firewall

142
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:02,800
that prevents you from running those

143
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,479
types of queries so

144
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:06,720
your sub-goal would be to try and bypass

145
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:07,600
the waff

146
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,280
in order to get your queries to the web

147
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:12,080
app and then further exploit it

148
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:15,360
means end analysis is simply working out

149
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,440
what the difference is currently between

150
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,360
your present state and the end goal and

151
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,440
then trying to reduce that difference

152
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,440
and then finally and probably most

153
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,560
interestingly i think is

154
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:28,000
insight and insight results in a change

155
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,400
in the problem space itself

156
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,639
so to give you an example from the world

157
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:34,240
of riddles and puzzles

158
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,560
um you're probably familiar with the the

159
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,800
riddle of

160
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,280
the boat and the river so you have a

161
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,720
number of items

162
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:45,120
a bag of corn a chicken and a fox and

163
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,400
you have to get them over to the other

164
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,080
side of a river in a boat

165
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,479
but you can only take one item across at

166
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:51,440
a time

167
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,800
and if you leave the corner with the

168
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,479
chicken the chicken is the corn if you

169
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:55,919
leave the chicken with the fox

170
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:58,880
the fox eats the chicken so insight with

171
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,319
that particular riddle is the

172
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:01,360
realization

173
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,400
that as well as taking things from

174
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,720
riverbank a to riverbank b you can also

175
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:07,520
take them back

176
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:09,199
in the opposite direction and that's

177
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:12,960
what opens up a solution in that case

178
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,800
in terms of testing testing and

179
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,400
measuring problem solving ability so

180
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,880
problem solving ability is often

181
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:21,840
it's considered an innate skill it's

182
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,360
something which you either have or you

183
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:23,840
don't

184
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:26,160
you can't teach it and the research

185
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,000
suggests that actually that isn't true

186
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,680
that everyone can get better at problem

187
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,120
solving everyone has the ability to

188
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,199
problem solve and to improve

189
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:34,319
and there are various ways you can

190
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:36,000
measure someone's problem-solving

191
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,680
ability you can measure it by the time

192
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:40,319
it takes them to solve certain problems

193
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:42,000
probably most compellingly their

194
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,759
approach to problem solving

195
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:45,919
but also their comfort level with

196
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:47,759
ambiguity

197
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:49,360
with uncertain situations with

198
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:52,000
unpredictability and that sort of thing

199
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,479
and there are various specific tests

200
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:56,240
that researchers have come up with

201
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:59,280
for perhaps testing out how good someone

202
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,560
is of problem solving

203
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:03,199
a survey of statements testing people's

204
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:04,960
tolerance for ambiguity

205
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,800
and embedded figures tests which may

206
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,160
give you an indication of someone's

207
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,599
ability to deal with

208
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:12,719
unstructured tasks

209
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,400
the role of expertise in problem solving

210
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,400
is an interesting one especially

211
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:21,919
in security so experts

212
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:24,240
tend to know a larger variety of what

213
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,000
are called problem schemas

214
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,960
a schema is a categorization of a

215
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:29,919
problem

216
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:31,759
it's saying oh this is one of those

217
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:33,599
types of problems

218
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:35,120
any evidence suggests that particularly

219
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,720
with experts the triggering

220
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,880
process for those schemas happens

221
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,080
earlier than it does

222
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,479
for non-experts that can lead to

223
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:44,240
problems it can lead

224
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:47,280
people to make assumptions and

225
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:50,720
with some problems those assumptions can

226
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,479
be quite dangerous and particularly

227
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:53,759
again in the world of puzzles and

228
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:55,919
riddles authors of puzzles will often

229
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:57,520
play on those assumptions in order to

230
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:58,080
try and trick

231
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:01,360
you so if you take um the knights and

232
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,160
knaves type

233
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,160
puzzle for example you may have come

234
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,080
across this before this is where

235
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,520
knights always tell the truth names

236
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,759
always lie and you have to try and work

237
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:11,520
out information by asking

238
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:14,319
one of them or both of them the question

239
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:15,039
and

240
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:16,639
typically those sorts of problems there

241
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:19,039
are lots of problems within that kind of

242
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:21,360
that category but those sorts of

243
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,080
problems

244
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:26,560
tend to have one approach and

245
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,319
if you kind of read the set up to a

246
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:29,759
puzzle and you assume oh it's going to

247
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:31,360
be one of those types of puzzles

248
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,719
that can lead you down a path of

249
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:34,399
assumptions which may make it much

250
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:38,080
harder to actually solve the puzzle

251
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,080
some evidence suggests that expertise

252
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,839
might not play a huge role

253
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:43,760
in some problems or some areas of

254
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:46,000
problem solving so there was a study

255
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,200
some time ago where undergraduates and

256
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,200
mathematicians were given algebra

257
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,399
problems

258
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:55,839
and you would expect that the experts

259
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:57,360
the mathematicians

260
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,120
would look at a problem and say oh it's

261
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,800
one of these types of problems and then

262
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:01,760
solve it

263
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,760
but actually that didn't happen what

264
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,279
happened was um

265
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:08,959
that the the experts took about as much

266
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:09,440
time

267
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,680
to solve the problems as the novices as

268
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:12,880
the undergraduates

269
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:15,120
but they made fewer mistakes that was

270
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,720
kind of the key differential

271
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:19,680
um there some other things that experts

272
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,279
tend to do as opposed to novices they

273
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:23,279
tend to sort problems into categories

274
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:25,839
based on solutions whereas novices tend

275
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:28,640
to sort them based on the problem itself

276
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:31,839
experts as i mentioned may perform

277
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:32,399
faster

278
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:34,240
it may be something to do with what's

279
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,320
called memory chunking

280
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:39,519
which is essentially kind of being able

281
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:41,760
to make certain deductive leaps

282
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:44,399
based on putting kind of chunks of

283
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:46,480
memory and chunks of experience together

284
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:49,440
but as i said experts often don't

285
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,600
perform faster

286
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,880
the key difference might be that they

287
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:55,120
just make fewer mistakes experts also

288
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:57,200
tend to be better at self-monitoring so

289
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,040
working out where they're going wrong

290
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,279
and also estimating the difficulty at

291
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:02,640
the start of the process which is

292
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,560
obviously very important particularly as

293
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:08,160
you can imagine in security as well

294
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:11,279
now there are a number of biases which

295
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:12,800
are

296
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,399
particularly applicable to problem

297
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:16,800
solving i've put six here but there are

298
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,399
likely many more

299
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:20,480
so experience bias is something you see

300
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,440
quite a lot

301
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:24,480
with decision makers with management and

302
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:25,680
it's relying on past

303
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:28,399
experience to make decisions again

304
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:29,920
similar to that kind of triggering

305
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:32,000
process of schemas to say oh we've had a

306
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,600
similar situation before

307
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,360
that's how we dealt with it then this is

308
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,040
how we're going to deal with it now

309
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:39,200
and whilst that can be useful it can

310
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,079
also lead to

311
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:42,640
assumptions it can lead to making the

312
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,240
wrong decision

313
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:46,000
and not recognizing that the current

314
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,519
situation is different from previous

315
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:48,880
situations

316
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:51,519
self-serving bias is um almost a kind of

317
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:53,440
ego related one so this is the the

318
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,959
belief that we're making logical and

319
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:56,160
rational decisions

320
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,880
even if we're not necessarily hindsight

321
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,959
bias is putting higher probabilities

322
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:04,240
on known outcomes uh anchoring is a

323
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,920
particularly important one so anchoring

324
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:06,640
is a process

325
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,720
of avoiding what's called cognitive

326
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:11,040
dissonance and cognitive dissonance

327
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,399
there's been a lot of research written

328
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:14,800
about it it's essentially

329
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:18,079
the kind of gap between reality and our

330
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:19,360
beliefs

331
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,839
and understanding that that gap exists

332
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:22,720
and we

333
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:25,200
kind of as a species will go a long way

334
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:25,920
to

335
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:28,000
to avoid cognitive dissonance and that's

336
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,440
particularly the case with uh with

337
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,279
problem solving

338
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:32,959
confirmation bias i'm sure many people

339
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:34,000
have heard of that's kind of

340
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,440
prioritizing evidence

341
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:37,440
that reinforces our beliefs and not

342
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,200
prioritizing or placing

343
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,680
lesser importance on evidence that

344
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,200
challenges our beliefs

345
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,680
and then finally the sunk costs fallacy

346
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,680
so this isn't so much a bias

347
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:50,079
but it is a kind of logical fallacy and

348
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:51,920
it's an interesting example

349
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:54,480
and you may kind of have come across

350
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,920
examples of this

351
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:58,399
in your professional experience the sunk

352
00:11:58,399 --> 00:11:59,279
cost fallacy

353
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:02,079
uh an example that's commonly given is

354
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:03,360
if you work for a company that's

355
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,079
building

356
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:08,480
a new type of plane and this plane is

357
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:09,680
is doing something that's never been

358
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:11,200
done before whatever that is it's some

359
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:11,839
sort of

360
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:15,680
innovation um and you've spent

361
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:18,000
90 percent of your budget um you're

362
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
about two weeks away from launching

363
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,399
this plane uh not literally but you're

364
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:23,680
about two weeks away from actually

365
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:24,800
putting it on the market and selling it

366
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:25,839
to someone

367
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:28,720
and then you hear that your competitor

368
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:29,200
has

369
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:32,160
used exactly the same innovation but in

370
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,839
a much more efficient way they're gonna

371
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:35,440
sell their plane for cheaper

372
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:37,360
it works better it's safer it's more

373
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,680
reliable and they're going to release it

374
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:42,320
in a week's time so the sunk cost

375
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:42,959
fallacy

376
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:44,720
is kind of saying oh well we've come

377
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,079
this far we're going to spend the

378
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:46,959
remaining 10

379
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:48,800
of our budget and we're going to work

380
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,240
the next two weeks

381
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:52,800
to launch our plane anyway even though

382
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:53,519
we know

383
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:55,600
that there's uh you know a far better

384
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:56,800
product that's going to be on the market

385
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:57,760
before that

386
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,680
and it's about kind of weighing up in

387
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:00,959
the long run when it's actually going to

388
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:03,599
cost you more

389
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,240
so improvement strategies generally for

390
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:08,079
problem solving um the first is just to

391
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:08,880
do more so

392
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:11,519
like any cognitive skill or really any

393
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:12,639
motor skill

394
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:15,040
uh the more you do the better you get at

395
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:15,680
it

396
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:17,920
and the more you do you'll find that

397
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:19,120
some of these

398
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:21,279
strategies will kind of come into place

399
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:23,360
almost automatically so compounding for

400
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,079
example

401
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:25,760
this is putting one or more operators

402
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,760
together enabling you to make deductive

403
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:28,320
leaps

404
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,079
that's not something you think about

405
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:31,360
consciously or something that just

406
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,279
happened

407
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:34,639
some things you do need to think about

408
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:36,399
consciously are testing assumptions

409
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:38,320
and changing your beliefs recognizing

410
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,160
that you have a particular perspective

411
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:41,040
on the world

412
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:43,440
and that perspective may inhibit

413
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,399
solutions

414
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:47,839
rather than yield them top-down

415
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:48,639
refinement

416
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:50,959
is another habit of experts in

417
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:51,839
problem-solving

418
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:53,920
it's about looking at the bigger picture

419
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,680
there are also specific strategies you

420
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:56,720
can undertake

421
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:59,600
to help conceptualize problems in order

422
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:00,639
to solve them

423
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:02,320
so again from the world of puzzles and

424
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,639
riddles uh the monty hall problem

425
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:06,560
um i'll let you look up in your own time

426
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,000
i won't go into it here but it's a

427
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,839
problem that asks you to start quite

428
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:10,959
small

429
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:13,600
and actually the answer isn't obvious

430
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:14,560
unless you

431
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:17,600
come at it big so as opposed to three

432
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,040
things which is in the original monty

433
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:19,839
hall problem

434
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:21,519
if you expand that to 100 things it

435
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:23,600
becomes a lot easier to understand

436
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,839
the blue eyes riddle which i'll come on

437
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:27,920
to a little bit later

438
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:30,639
is a logic puzzle which starts with um

439
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:32,399
which starts big with a hundred

440
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:34,720
things and that could be kind of quite

441
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,959
difficult to conceptualize but if you

442
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:38,480
look at it from the perspective of

443
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:40,320
starting small and start with

444
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,480
one thing then it becomes a lot easier

445
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:43,839
to conceptualize and you kind of

446
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:45,199
gradually build up two things three

447
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:46,959
things and so on

448
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:48,639
avoiding rabbit holes is an important

449
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:50,560
one so you know rabbit holes

450
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:52,480
particularly in security we end up down

451
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:53,519
a lot of them

452
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:55,199
particularly for those in technical

453
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:57,360
roles

454
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,959
rabbit holes can be good they're not

455
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:00,480
necessarily bad

456
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:03,440
they can lead you to the acquisition of

457
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,480
very niche

458
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:06,880
and important and otherwise obscure

459
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:07,760
learning

460
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:10,480
that can be very good the issue is when

461
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:11,279
it

462
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:13,600
distracts you from the end goal and when

463
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,040
you end up down a rabbit hole and can't

464
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:15,600
remember

465
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:18,720
how you got there or how to get out so

466
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,720
that's just a conscious thing you have

467
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,000
to be kind of you have to be conscious

468
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,079
of it when you end up down a rabbit hole

469
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:25,519
you have to remember why you went down

470
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:26,800
there in the first place and how to get

471
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,680
back out

472
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:31,120
self-explanation or rubber ducky

473
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:31,839
debugging

474
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:34,880
so anyone in development um will

475
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,639
perhaps be familiar with the concept of

476
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:38,240
rubber ducky debugging

477
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:40,160
you uh you know when you're having a

478
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:41,600
shower or having a bath

479
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:44,160
you explain the problem to an inanimate

480
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:45,920
object like a rubber duck

481
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:49,040
and that helps you to uh hopefully make

482
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:49,920
some breakthroughs in the

483
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:51,440
problem-solving process

484
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,360
by explaining the problem to yourself as

485
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:56,160
if you're explaining it to someone else

486
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:57,920
spontaneous thought i mentioned a little

487
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:59,199
bit earlier this is about

488
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:01,600
letting the problem sort of wash over

489
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:02,800
you and not thinking about it

490
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,560
consciously

491
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:07,440
although the evidence suggests that your

492
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,240
brain will

493
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,360
at least part of your brain will

494
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,519
continue working on that problem um

495
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:15,120
unconsciously and then finally

496
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:17,680
awareness of various biases so including

497
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,279
the ones the six ones that i

498
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:21,120
went through earlier but also just

499
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,800
recognizing in general

500
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:26,240
that we see the world

501
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,600
or tend to see the world through

502
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:30,000
dominant constructs

503
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,920
this means that we have a particular

504
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:34,800
world view which we prefer

505
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:37,759
and dominant constructs tend to inhib

506
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:39,279
inhibit solutions

507
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:42,160
um whereas alternate constructs

508
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,360
recognizing that there are other

509
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:44,959
worldviews or other ways to see the

510
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:45,519
world

511
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:49,199
can actually lead to solutions

512
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:52,160
and to problem solving

513
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:55,040
okay so i'm just going to cover problem

514
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:58,480
solving in infosec now so

515
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:01,040
infosec problem solving problems in

516
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:01,920
security

517
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,360
tend to be what are called knowledge

518
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,760
rich problems that is that they require

519
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:08,000
knowledge outside of the problem itself

520
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,439
whether that's technical knowledge

521
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:11,039
policy knowledge

522
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:12,640
experience in a particular thing

523
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:14,640
whatever it happens to be

524
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:17,039
and they can also be quite ill-defined

525
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:18,400
so they may not have

526
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,959
concrete boundaries that may not be a

527
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:22,640
sort of concrete limit on the problem

528
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:25,439
area or the problem space

529
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:28,240
a variety of people undertake problems

530
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:29,120
in security

531
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:31,120
coming from a variety of backgrounds and

532
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:33,280
levels of experience from experts

533
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:35,200
through to pre-novices so people who are

534
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,120
completely new to the field

535
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:38,880
and there are many schemas depending on

536
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,880
on which particular part of security you

537
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:43,120
work in

538
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:45,760
i'm sure you could think of hundreds of

539
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:46,559
examples

540
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:48,880
of problems in infosec both technical

541
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,400
and non-technical

542
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,960
i just wanted to talk about one very

543
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,080
briefly

544
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:55,600
which i think illustrates the process

545
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:58,080
pretty well so it's a talk from

546
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:02,080
defcon 16 by mati aharoni

547
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:04,559
of the offensive security team and he's

548
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:06,320
talking about a particular

549
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:08,000
exploit that was developed for a

550
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,679
particular vulnerability

551
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:12,840
and whilst developing that exploit they

552
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:15,440
experienced multiple obstacles multiple

553
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:17,039
setbacks which required

554
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:20,320
natural thinking um and innovation

555
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:22,160
and awareness of biases and that sort of

556
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:24,960
thing so really good examples on youtube

557
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:27,039
uh and generally speaking the same

558
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:28,320
strategies

559
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:31,120
apply for improvement when it comes to

560
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:32,240
problem solving

561
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:34,480
for problem solving and security as they

562
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:35,679
do for problem solving

563
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:38,080
generally

564
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:40,080
a couple of other things that might

565
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:42,240
assist with problem solving in security

566
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,400
the first is problem item offs so this

567
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,160
is essentially a problem

568
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:48,640
which or two problems which have the

569
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:49,840
same underlying

570
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:51,520
requirements and the same underlying

571
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:53,280
demands but may have a slightly

572
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,559
different cover story

573
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:56,480
so the actual problem space remains the

574
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:57,450
same

575
00:18:57,450 --> 00:18:58,880
[Music]

576
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:02,080
on that note incomplete knowledge

577
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:04,240
transfer may be useful so

578
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:06,310
knowledge transfer is the

579
00:19:06,310 --> 00:19:08,320
[Music]

580
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:11,760
use of experience and awareness and

581
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:12,320
knowledge

582
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:14,240
from one domain to another it very

583
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:15,760
rarely happens completely

584
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:17,520
if at all but certainly it can it

585
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:19,600
happens incompletely all the time

586
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,520
which is why it's important i think to

587
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:23,039
have a diversity and background and

588
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:25,600
expertise and security

589
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:26,520
for people to come from

590
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:28,640
multidisciplinary backgrounds because

591
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:29,440
many people

592
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:30,880
will be able to apply that knowledge

593
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:34,160
transfer and come up with a solution

594
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:36,640
and that can be useful for applying

595
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:38,320
puzzles and riddles and learning from

596
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:38,960
those

597
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:42,480
to real world situations

598
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:44,320
and then there's problem solving by

599
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:46,160
analogy so

600
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:48,480
um if you particularly if you work in a

601
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,160
technical role you'll be familiar with

602
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,200
analogies and

603
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,039
using them to explain various technical

604
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:55,679
concepts to less technical audiences

605
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:56,960
but it can also help with problem

606
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,960
solving as well the research does

607
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:00,240
suggest that people

608
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,159
need to be explicitly told of what that

609
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:04,159
told what that analogy is

610
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:05,840
in order to try and make it relate to

611
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:08,559
the problem um but certainly with things

612
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:10,240
like ctfs

613
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:13,039
um there is uh an element of problem

614
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:16,080
solving by analogy there

615
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:19,120
so i mentioned ctfs i'm now going to

616
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:20,799
talk about our puzzle program which i

617
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:22,960
think is kind of an alternative way

618
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:26,080
to uh to address problem solving uh

619
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:28,960
in security

620
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:36,000
so at pwc we have about 300 staff

621
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,919
comprising people from deep technical

622
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:39,520
disciplines like pen testing internet

623
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:40,400
response

624
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:43,039
through to architecture specialists core

625
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:45,520
consultants sector specific consultants

626
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:47,039
and people in support policy and

627
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:48,960
leadership roles as well it's a really

628
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:51,039
varied mix of backgrounds and technical

629
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:51,919
knowledge

630
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:54,000
and uh just looking at this graphic here

631
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,200
this represents

632
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,440
people's undergraduate degrees in our

633
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:58,320
practice

634
00:20:58,320 --> 00:20:59,760
so you can see obviously computer

635
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:01,760
science comes out on top as you'd expect

636
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,440
but a whole host of

637
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:06,720
qualifications in other sciences in arts

638
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,640
and humanities in language

639
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:11,840
and other subjects as well

640
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,360
so the first puzzle began in early 2018

641
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:17,039
with me trolling a colleague

642
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:19,120
with a puzzle you can find a version of

643
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:20,720
it at that link

644
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:22,159
and it's supposed to be one of the

645
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:24,240
hardest logic puzzles

646
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:28,080
ever since then they've been about 40

647
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:28,640
puzzles

648
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:30,799
most of them i've designed from scratch

649
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:32,159
although some of them have been adapted

650
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:33,679
from existing puzzles and they tend to

651
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:35,440
cover these four categories

652
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,679
work play or cryptic puzzles logic

653
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:38,559
puzzles

654
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:40,880
math and probability and technical

655
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:41,760
challenges

656
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:44,720
so similar to ctfs or ctfs some of them

657
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,640
are themed some of them are abstract

658
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,480
some of them are independent some of

659
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:50,400
them are multi-stage so you need the

660
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,919
answers from a previous

661
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:54,240
stage to get to the next stage and the

662
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:55,520
majority of them are designed to be

663
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:57,360
solved within two or three days although

664
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:58,159
some

665
00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:01,760
take a little bit longer and the perfect

666
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:03,600
puzzle ideally

667
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,360
has some sort of interesting story or

668
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:06,960
premise behind it something that draws

669
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:07,840
people in

670
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:10,159
ideally it has very little exposition

671
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:12,000
you don't really want paragraphs of

672
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:12,880
explanation

673
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:15,120
of the background of the puzzle you may

674
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:16,960
have a hidden trapdoor function this is

675
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,480
optional but

676
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:20,000
an alternative way to get to the

677
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,600
solution which might rely

678
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:24,799
on a particular particularly lateral

679
00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:26,080
piece of thinking

680
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:28,080
or a particular piece of knowledge you

681
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:31,120
can have red herrings and easter eggs

682
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:32,799
really depends on your preference i like

683
00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:34,799
putting them in i have a colleague who

684
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:36,720
designs escape rooms who

685
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:38,720
detests red herrings but it really

686
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:40,640
depends on your preference

687
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,159
some of the most interesting puzzles

688
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:43,600
actually are something completely

689
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:44,480
unconnected

690
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,960
to the premise of the puzzle itself they

691
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:49,200
can be uh really fascinating ones

692
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,280
but ideally a puzzle always has its own

693
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:52,799
internal logic the answer should be

694
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:53,520
obtainable

695
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:55,679
from the question itself and ideally

696
00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:56,720
other than maybe

697
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,720
the use of a search engine for a quick

698
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,880
query you shouldn't need any specialist

699
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:01,520
knowledge

700
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:04,960
beyond the premise itself either

701
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:07,360
so a very quick example of a puzzle that

702
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:08,880
we've run i won't read this whole thing

703
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:10,080
out but essentially you're trying to

704
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,760
find someone's birthday from various

705
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:12,640
clues

706
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:15,840
the crucial clue here is

707
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:17,440
square eight to get the month and the

708
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:19,440
day add another square to that and it's

709
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,320
obvious

710
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:22,880
and what you're being asked is what is

711
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:25,200
the date of birth what's the birthday

712
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,679
and where does my friend live and the

713
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:29,840
location of where my friend lives is

714
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:31,760
an example of something seemingly

715
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:37,200
unconnected to the premise of the puzzle

716
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:39,840
so on reading that puzzle i'm playing on

717
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:41,520
various assumptions i'm giving various

718
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,120
clues so an assumption is

719
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:44,480
that the date of birth is going to be a

720
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:46,240
normal date ie

721
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:48,000
is going to have a maximum of 31 for the

722
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,480
day a maximum of 12 for the month

723
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:52,000
i've mentioned that it's an old school

724
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,880
friend of mine obviously i'm over 18 so

725
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,559
the person is going to be over 18 and

726
00:23:56,559 --> 00:23:58,080
having a beer at a bar so

727
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:00,080
at least in the uk you would be kind of

728
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:01,120
over 18

729
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:04,640
for that um squaring eight to get the

730
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:05,440
month and day

731
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:08,320
that's 64. so probably talking about

732
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:10,960
either the 6th of april the 4th of june

733
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:12,720
and then the puzzle says add another

734
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:14,799
square and it should be obvious

735
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:16,480
and this is where the kind of lateral

736
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:17,919
thinking comes in and challenging

737
00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:18,880
assumptions

738
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:20,720
because the square in this case is not a

739
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,640
mathematical term

740
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:25,679
the answer to the puzzle is the 35th of

741
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:26,120
may

742
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:29,440
1989 which in itself isn't a valid date

743
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:31,200
but in china it's used to refer to the

744
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:33,440
4th of june 1989 which was the date of

745
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:35,679
the tiananmen square protests

746
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:38,640
and that date the 35th of may fulfills

747
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,080
all of the conditions around the prime

748
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:40,960
factors

749
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,559
that the day minus the month equals the

750
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:44,080
age of next birthday or at least it did

751
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:45,440
in 2019

752
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:47,919
adding a square in this case means a

753
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:49,279
square as in a location

754
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:52,480
so if you google june 4th square

755
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,240
you will get stuff about the 4th of june

756
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:56,960
1989.

757
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,640
another example this is one of my

758
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,400
favorite ones so this was a three-part

759
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:01,120
puzzle

760
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:04,159
to give the location of a team

761
00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:06,720
event date which was being held off-site

762
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:08,240
so there were three parts

763
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:09,600
parts one and two were released at the

764
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:11,840
same time then part three afterwards

765
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:14,159
and you could use the answers from parts

766
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:15,279
one and two

767
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:16,799
together with the answer from part three

768
00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:19,120
to get the location of this site but you

769
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:20,960
could also just use part three

770
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:23,360
so part one was a wave file of the song

771
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:24,480
never gonna give you up

772
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:26,159
so a lot of people were looking into

773
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:27,679
rick astley's biography

774
00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:29,520
trying to get clues as to the location

775
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:31,279
from that but actually

776
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:32,960
uh if you looked at the wave file in a

777
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:34,720
spectrogram and

778
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:37,279
um analyzed that you came up with this

779
00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:38,240
wrist riddle

780
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:40,240
and the answer to that riddle is the

781
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:42,880
letter u so a u-boat a u-bend

782
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:46,240
a u is a horseshoe shape uh a u u is not

783
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:48,000
the first person it's second person

784
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,120
and sounds like a tree u tree

785
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:53,679
part two was an image which contained

786
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:56,559
the significant bit steganography if you

787
00:25:56,559 --> 00:25:59,200
analyze that to retrieve the hidden

788
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:00,000
message

789
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,440
you've got this clue here the use of a

790
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:04,559
search engine

791
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:06,240
together with reverse image searching of

792
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:08,159
that image would give you the answer so

793
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:11,520
it's 5446 the crew says to add one so

794
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:14,720
it's 55-46

795
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:17,039
and then part three was a short video of

796
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:18,080
the chessy

797
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:20,880
in 2001 a space odyssey where one of the

798
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:22,240
astronauts i can't remember which one is

799
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:24,880
playing chess with hal an alpha numeric

800
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:25,360
string

801
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:27,520
appeared at the end of that video and

802
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:29,279
there was obvious morse code

803
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:32,159
beeps over the scene itself now if you

804
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:33,600
decode those moss beeps

805
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,520
you get the message not going to be that

806
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:37,760
easy but again if you look at it in a

807
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:38,559
spectrogram

808
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:40,720
there's ultrasonic morse code which

809
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:44,480
spells out linechesterliches.org

810
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:46,159
the video brightness also flashed in

811
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:48,000
morse code to give pretty much the same

812
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:48,960
clue

813
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:52,480
and the kind of setup message

814
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:54,720
where i kind of announced the puzzle if

815
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:56,720
you look at the periods and hyphens

816
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:58,480
within that message they also spell out

817
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:00,480
morse code for that

818
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,640
so lightshares.org is a chess website

819
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:04,799
you can load up chess games

820
00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:07,360
if you went to uh lychester or plus the

821
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:09,279
alphanumeric string shown on the video

822
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:11,360
you got taken to this chess game that's

823
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:13,279
a form of chess steganography

824
00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:14,960
if you decode that you get this this

825
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:16,720
message which is

826
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:19,279
another alphanumeric string and then

827
00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:21,520
read the slack message again carefully

828
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:22,799
if you again went back to the

829
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:24,320
announcement of the puzzle the first

830
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:25,279
letter of

831
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:27,760
each sentence spells out paste bin if

832
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:28,960
you do paste bin

833
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:32,559
plus the string you get this riddle here

834
00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:34,240
and in particular pay attention to the

835
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:36,000
last line with hex

836
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:40,159
as key so that's a pun on ascii

837
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:41,760
if you convert everything to that's

838
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:43,360
already ascii to hex

839
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:45,760
and everything that is hex to ascii you

840
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:47,520
end up with

841
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:52,520
zero time seven five uf or a uk postcode

842
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:55,279
ox75uf which was the postcode of the

843
00:27:55,279 --> 00:27:57,120
away day there was a way to solve it

844
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:58,799
just through that riddle itself through

845
00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:00,480
that written riddle so

846
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:02,480
if you solved each line of that you

847
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:04,399
would be able to get some search terms

848
00:28:04,399 --> 00:28:05,360
which you could

849
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:06,880
put into a search engine and that would

850
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:10,480
also give you the location as well

851
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:13,360
so i've got some stats on the kind of

852
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:15,600
puzzles that we run and how many we run

853
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:17,919
so the overwhelming majority of puzzles

854
00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:20,080
to date have been uh logic puzzles

855
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:22,000
but also quite a few were playing tech

856
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,679
puzzles and then maths

857
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:26,080
are kind of in fourth place there the

858
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:27,760
most successful category

859
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:30,720
has been bass puzzles then tech then

860
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:34,000
wordplay and then logic

861
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:36,080
the graph on the left illustrates

862
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:38,000
answers over time so the dark red line

863
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,080
is correct answers over time and the

864
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:43,120
paler redline is incorrect answers so

865
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:45,679
um probably not quite enough data to

866
00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:47,440
make inferences there properly but you

867
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:48,720
can see kind of what

868
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,559
the the correct answers have gone up

869
00:28:50,559 --> 00:28:52,240
over time the incorrect answers

870
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:53,840
have gone down certainly kind of in the

871
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:55,919
last year or so uh the graph on the

872
00:28:55,919 --> 00:28:58,080
right shows puzzle engagement over time

873
00:28:58,080 --> 00:28:59,679
so that has gone up over time there's

874
00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:01,679
been peaks and troughs as people are

875
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:04,399
busy or kind of more or less interested

876
00:29:04,399 --> 00:29:05,039
in puzzles

877
00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:06,240
or depending on what kind of

878
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:08,320
organizational activity the puzzles are

879
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:09,039
tied to

880
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:10,960
but overall the engagement has gone up

881
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:13,039
over time

882
00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:15,039
um tech puzzles have had the most

883
00:29:15,039 --> 00:29:16,720
engagement as you might expect it being

884
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:18,720
a cyber security vu but then wordplay

885
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:19,840
has the second most

886
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:22,240
so the second most kind of popular time

887
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:24,159
to solve is a little bit more difficult

888
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:26,720
um just because that tends to be a

889
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:27,600
function of the puzzle

890
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:31,039
difficulty which fluctuates from puzzle

891
00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:32,399
to puzzle

892
00:29:32,399 --> 00:29:34,159
depending on what type it is and who's

893
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:36,399
doing it so it's not really a reliable

894
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:37,840
indicator but it's interesting

895
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:39,279
the record we have for the quickest

896
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:40,640
puzzle ever solved with something like

897
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:41,679
four minutes

898
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:45,039
um and the one that's taken the longest

899
00:29:45,039 --> 00:29:48,720
is just under two days

900
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,799
so i just wanted to show you some

901
00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:52,399
unexpected or amusing

902
00:29:52,399 --> 00:29:54,960
kind of answers we've had this was in

903
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,640
relation to the birthday puzzle i took

904
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:57,919
you through earlier

905
00:29:57,919 --> 00:29:59,760
um this was someone who went to extreme

906
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:02,159
lengths with the the morse code video

907
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:04,720
to try and find the differences in the

908
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:06,080
frame brightness

909
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:09,120
and other clues like that a very common

910
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:09,840
response

911
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:12,159
uh especially specifically with the kind

912
00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:14,960
of lateral thinking logical puzzles

913
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:17,200
uh people kind of working together and

914
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:18,559
supporting each other and

915
00:30:18,559 --> 00:30:20,080
keeping each other going throughout

916
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:22,559
solving these and then my favorite one

917
00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:23,440
this is from

918
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:26,480
one of the partners of our business unit

919
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:28,320
who i think kind of pretty much summed

920
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:30,640
up his frustration with me

921
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:34,000
with some of these puzzles and then

922
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,679
there are also people of course when

923
00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:37,120
you're looking at problem solving who

924
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:37,840
just go

925
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:40,159
straight ahead and cut the gordian knot

926
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:41,039
into two

927
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:43,600
rather than trying to untie it and

928
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:44,960
there's one particular person in our

929
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:47,360
business unit does that i just wanted to

930
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:50,159
highlight some of his replies um so the

931
00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:50,960
fact that he

932
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:52,640
kind of crashes a bulldozer right

933
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:55,039
through my puzzles uh this was for the

934
00:30:55,039 --> 00:30:56,880
away day one so people weren't told the

935
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:58,320
location of the away day until the

936
00:30:58,320 --> 00:30:59,679
puzzle had been solved

937
00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:01,200
he decided it would be easier to just

938
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:03,840
wait um this was a logic puzzle around

939
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:06,480
guessing the colors of hats

940
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:08,240
this was a knights and knave puzzle

941
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:10,080
around which door to go through so one

942
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:11,279
door leads to freedom

943
00:31:11,279 --> 00:31:13,200
the other leads to a room full of hungry

944
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:15,039
tigers um

945
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:17,200
and i particularly liked that second

946
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:20,480
sentence of that response

947
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:23,679
so i did a quick straw poll of people

948
00:31:23,679 --> 00:31:25,519
who've participated in the puzzles

949
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:27,039
over the last two years pretty small

950
00:31:27,039 --> 00:31:29,919
sample but just to get an idea of kind

951
00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:31,440
of how they feel about them

952
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:33,519
in terms of difficulty and the benefits

953
00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:34,799
so you can see most people

954
00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:37,600
estimate that the difficulties are hard

955
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:39,760
to fairly hard

956
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:42,960
most people love them or really enjoy

957
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:43,519
them

958
00:31:43,519 --> 00:31:44,559
and there's also quite a lot of

959
00:31:44,559 --> 00:31:46,720
collaboration so only a small percentage

960
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:47,519
of people

961
00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:49,039
from this dip sample actually never

962
00:31:49,039 --> 00:31:51,600
collaborate at all on puzzles

963
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:53,200
most people do it at least occasionally

964
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:56,799
and some people do it frequently as well

965
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:58,880
people on the whole agree that the

966
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:00,960
puzzles have contributed to culture and

967
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:03,039
collaboration and cooperation they've

968
00:32:03,039 --> 00:32:05,440
helped to develop problem solving skills

969
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:06,720
most people would like to do more

970
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:09,519
puzzles in the future and

971
00:32:09,519 --> 00:32:11,200
most people agree that problem solving

972
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:12,840
is especially important in cyber

973
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:15,279
security

974
00:32:15,279 --> 00:32:17,120
again most people agreeing that it is

975
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:18,799
important to try to strengthen

976
00:32:18,799 --> 00:32:20,880
problem-solving abilities more of a

977
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:22,640
mixed opinion for whether it's a good

978
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:24,320
idea to try to measure

979
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:27,440
problem-solving ability you could say

980
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:29,120
kind of uh you know it's a

981
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:30,799
it's a tie there between people who are

982
00:32:30,799 --> 00:32:32,399
neutral about it and people who either

983
00:32:32,399 --> 00:32:33,679
agree or strongly

984
00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:35,679
agree but certainly some people disagree

985
00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:36,720
with that

986
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:40,080
the puzzles should be job-specific egcts

987
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:41,679
again a mixed opinion on that some

988
00:32:41,679 --> 00:32:43,600
people agreeing some strongly

989
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:46,399
disagreeing some disagreeing

990
00:32:46,399 --> 00:32:48,080
and finally doing puzzles increases my

991
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:49,840
problem-solving capability

992
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:51,440
and all changes my perspective and

993
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:52,960
thinking so

994
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:54,720
some people remain neutral on that but

995
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:56,080
the majority of people

996
00:32:56,080 --> 00:33:00,159
agree with it and i also just wanted to

997
00:33:00,159 --> 00:33:01,279
highlight some

998
00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:03,440
individual feedback um some non-honest

999
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:05,200
feedback on on the benefits of this

1000
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:06,799
people's day-to-day role

1001
00:33:06,799 --> 00:33:09,200
so people saying it's a good

1002
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:10,720
illustration of the greater than the sum

1003
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:12,880
of parts concept

1004
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:14,799
helps them to look at the larger picture

1005
00:33:14,799 --> 00:33:16,159
when they're solving problems

1006
00:33:16,159 --> 00:33:18,720
used in my day-to-day role a correlation

1007
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:20,159
between

1008
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:24,480
possible solving at work and in life

1009
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,159
keeping problem skills uh problem

1010
00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:27,519
solving skills sharp

1011
00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:29,279
and being helpful for a range of

1012
00:33:29,279 --> 00:33:31,679
situations reading between the lines

1013
00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:34,000
thinking beyond what could be obvious

1014
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,600
and showing the application of a cyber

1015
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:36,559
concept

1016
00:33:36,559 --> 00:33:40,399
in practice i also asked people what

1017
00:33:40,399 --> 00:33:42,080
they thought were important attributes

1018
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:43,760
for problem solving

1019
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:45,919
open mind lateral thinking thinking

1020
00:33:45,919 --> 00:33:47,440
outside the box

1021
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:49,440
deliberation i think is an important one

1022
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:51,600
thinking holistically about a problem

1023
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:53,919
and crucially i think this one really

1024
00:33:53,919 --> 00:33:55,679
struck her with me is being able to let

1025
00:33:55,679 --> 00:33:57,519
go of a chain of thinking

1026
00:33:57,519 --> 00:33:59,760
if it's not working or if you realize

1027
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:00,880
that it's biased

1028
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:03,039
or ineffective assimilating new

1029
00:34:03,039 --> 00:34:05,679
information

1030
00:34:05,679 --> 00:34:06,720
structuring your thoughts and

1031
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:08,800
prioritizing issues again seeing the

1032
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:10,000
bigger picture

1033
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,719
curiosity and stubbornness i think um

1034
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:13,520
many people

1035
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:15,440
in security can relate to those two

1036
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:17,119
attributes um

1037
00:34:17,119 --> 00:34:18,960
dividing and conquering the problem to

1038
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:20,800
to

1039
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:23,760
come up with accurate sub problems so a

1040
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:26,000
good illustration there of sub calling

1041
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,879
of breaking the problem down into

1042
00:34:28,879 --> 00:34:31,759
achievable parts

1043
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:34,639
so i wanted to cover a quick case study

1044
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:36,159
of where myself and a colleague used

1045
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:37,918
this on a piece of research so

1046
00:34:37,918 --> 00:34:40,560
a couple of years ago um myself and

1047
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:41,839
someone else were working on a project

1048
00:34:41,839 --> 00:34:43,440
called sand grox which was

1049
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:46,560
coming up with various ways for our

1050
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:49,839
red teaming malware to detect and evade

1051
00:34:49,839 --> 00:34:53,280
sandboxes on targeted hosts

1052
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:56,000
and to do this we had to do a number of

1053
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,359
the things i've talked about

1054
00:34:57,359 --> 00:34:58,960
in this presentation we had to think

1055
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:00,720
laterally think of novel forms of

1056
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:01,440
detection

1057
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:04,000
so going beyond cpu red pills and things

1058
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,440
like that to thinking about

1059
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:07,920
environmental factors you know what

1060
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:09,520
programs were installed how many recent

1061
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:11,680
documents are there that sort of thing

1062
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:13,520
challenging our own assumptions about

1063
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:15,760
what a sandbox can and can't detect

1064
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:18,079
sub-goaling so testing if something is

1065
00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:19,280
technically feasible

1066
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:21,520
before actually testing if it actually

1067
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:22,400
contributes

1068
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:24,720
to the end state avoiding rabbit holes

1069
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:26,400
was a key one we ended up down a few

1070
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:28,800
rabbit holes but crucially were able to

1071
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:30,880
to kind of find our way back out of them

1072
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:32,400
spontaneous thought played quite a big

1073
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:33,520
part in this project

1074
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:35,119
leading a problem kind of wash over us

1075
00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:36,560
for a few days and then coming back to

1076
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:37,280
it

1077
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:39,599
avoiding bias particularly in this case

1078
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:40,960
self-serving bias

1079
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:42,480
so thinking we were making which called

1080
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:44,480
irrational decisions but sometimes we

1081
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:45,520
weren't

1082
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:47,680
and then finally problem isomorphs so

1083
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:49,119
there are a lot of related

1084
00:35:49,119 --> 00:35:51,839
problems in security which helped us

1085
00:35:51,839 --> 00:35:52,960
with this project

1086
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:55,760
human computer interaction bot detection

1087
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:57,359
and antivirus evasion

1088
00:35:57,359 --> 00:36:00,320
specifically but also some other areas

1089
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:02,640
as well

1090
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:04,720
so if you want to start your own puzzle

1091
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:06,800
program i would highly recommend you do

1092
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:07,119
it

1093
00:36:07,119 --> 00:36:09,440
you could do a pilot to start with just

1094
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:10,320
to see how it goes

1095
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:11,760
if you want to do that i would strongly

1096
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:14,160
recommend starting off with pre-existing

1097
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:16,560
puzzles that you can find on these

1098
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:17,599
resources here

1099
00:36:17,599 --> 00:36:19,119
just because creating puzzles from

1100
00:36:19,119 --> 00:36:21,599
scratch once you're starting off it's

1101
00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:23,119
very time consuming so the

1102
00:36:23,119 --> 00:36:24,800
the away day puzzle that i mentioned the

1103
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:27,040
three-parter that took something like 14

1104
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:27,920
hours

1105
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:29,440
to come up with and to actually

1106
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:31,760
implement some good resources for

1107
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:32,800
finding puzzles

1108
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:35,920
or guiding tips on on puzzle creation is

1109
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:37,440
puzzling stack exchange

1110
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:39,200
the ted-ed youtube channel has a number

1111
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:40,640
of riddles and puzzles on it

1112
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:42,000
you can always find good cryptic

1113
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,680
crosswords in newspapers

1114
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:45,359
and then of course in security there are

1115
00:36:45,359 --> 00:36:47,359
ctfs there's defcon challenges

1116
00:36:47,359 --> 00:36:50,960
badge challenges and things like that

1117
00:36:51,359 --> 00:36:52,880
lessons that i've learned from doing

1118
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:54,720
this for two years it's really important

1119
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:56,640
to mix up the formats and the genres to

1120
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:58,000
broaden appeal and keep people

1121
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,359
interested

1122
00:36:59,359 --> 00:37:01,119
really important to measure engagement

1123
00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:03,599
and statistics as you go

1124
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:05,040
it can be quite difficult to try and do

1125
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:06,640
that retrospectively

1126
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:09,119
so ideally you release the puzzles or

1127
00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:10,880
riddles on some sort of platform where

1128
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:12,560
you can at least approximate

1129
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:14,640
approximate engagement measures of

1130
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:15,839
engagement

1131
00:37:15,839 --> 00:37:17,599
linking to other organizational activity

1132
00:37:17,599 --> 00:37:19,280
really helps so if you have

1133
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:22,160
team events that sort of thing linking a

1134
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:22,960
puzzle with

1135
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:25,200
puzzles with those can help with

1136
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:26,640
engagement

1137
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:28,880
encouraging collaboration whether that's

1138
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:30,720
mandating that people have to do them in

1139
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:31,280
teams

1140
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:34,079
or encouraging teamwork or designing the

1141
00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:36,320
puzzles specifically so that

1142
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:38,000
um you know maybe some of it could be

1143
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,079
solved by a pen tester but actually to

1144
00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:41,280
solve the next bit they're going to have

1145
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:42,560
to go and speak to someone in threat

1146
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:43,440
intelligence

1147
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:46,400
or incident response or someone on an

1148
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:47,520
architecture team

1149
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:49,680
or something like that incentives and

1150
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:51,359
prizes obviously can help

1151
00:37:51,359 --> 00:37:52,960
and crucially i think encouraging

1152
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:55,440
inclusivity so not alienating would-be

1153
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:56,320
participants

1154
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:59,280
by making it all technical or making it

1155
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:00,240
all about

1156
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:04,240
strategy for example

1157
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:07,040
okay so just to sum up um problem

1158
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:08,800
solving is a skill

1159
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:10,720
and like any skill it can be

1160
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:12,400
strengthened and there are specific

1161
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:14,800
processes which underpin it there are

1162
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:16,480
also specific strategies

1163
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:18,240
for improving it it's not just the case

1164
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:20,079
of do it more often although that does

1165
00:38:20,079 --> 00:38:20,560
help

1166
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:22,800
but there are specific things you can do

1167
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,079
to

1168
00:38:24,079 --> 00:38:27,119
strengthen problem solving ability also

1169
00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:28,720
worth noting that there are specific

1170
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:31,200
risks and biases associated with problem

1171
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:33,119
solving and that really they need to be

1172
00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:34,240
recognized

1173
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:36,880
before you can improve puzzles and

1174
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:38,400
riddles are a great way to develop

1175
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:39,920
problem solving skills

1176
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:42,800
it's not necessarily an isolated case of

1177
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:44,400
it just makes you better at puzzles or

1178
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:45,359
riddles

1179
00:38:45,359 --> 00:38:47,440
it gives you skills and abilities which

1180
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:49,520
you can then apply to larger problems

1181
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:51,200
and day-to-day problems as well as

1182
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:52,640
contributing to culture

1183
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:54,960
and engagement the designer type of

1184
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:56,560
puzzle is really important

1185
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:58,560
and it does need some thought before you

1186
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:01,200
go ahead and release it

1187
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:03,040
so hopefully i'm going to create at some

1188
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:04,480
point a repository of some of the

1189
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:06,320
puzzles i've done

1190
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:08,560
at my workplace i would love it if

1191
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:10,400
people would have theirs

1192
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:12,400
once that's up and running plus

1193
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:13,920
statistics around engagement would be

1194
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:15,440
really helpful critiques

1195
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:18,400
analyses that kind of thing um there is

1196
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:20,000
certainly a gap in the research

1197
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,720
on the psychology of security related

1198
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:25,119
problem solving

1199
00:39:25,119 --> 00:39:26,800
there has been research previously on

1200
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:28,480
problem solving in the context of

1201
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:29,520
software development

1202
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:31,839
and programming but not much on security

1203
00:39:31,839 --> 00:39:33,440
related problem solving so that i think

1204
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:35,040
would be a really interesting topic

1205
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:36,800
i'm hoping to do some some more work on

1206
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:39,119
that and i hope other people do as well

1207
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:40,640
and lastly don't forget to have a crack

1208
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:42,800
