2
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:16,239
stopping snake oil with smaller

3
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:17,520
healthcare providers

4
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:18,960
how we can address security with

5
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:21,039
actionable plans and maximum

6
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:24,320
value so what's been going on

7
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:26,320
healthcare has been the most affected

8
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:28,240
industry by ransomware data breaches and

9
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:29,119
hacks

10
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:30,960
i take a look on the news every week

11
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,880
there's yet another provider that's been

12
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:33,600
hacked

13
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,520
in a lot of cases providers have had to

14
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,840
shut down and patients were not

15
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:39,760
even able to get hold of their medical

16
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:40,879
records

17
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:43,920
and so what we've noticed in our work is

18
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:46,079
the guidance provided to many providers

19
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:48,399
has not addressed what organizations

20
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:49,840
actually need to do to protect their

21
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:51,840
patients and themselves

22
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,600
there hasn't been that specific list and

23
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,000
tool set they can use

24
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,120
so why are we here

25
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:00,559
there have been a lot of snake oil

26
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:02,160
companies out there that have only

27
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,000
provided risk assessments

28
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,680
that cost a lot of these smaller

29
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,680
providers tens of thousands of dollars

30
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:10,400
and don't deliver anything of value and

31
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,520
worse

32
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:13,360
taking money out of the risk management

33
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:15,040
plans aka

34
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:18,000
negative value we want to change that

35
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:18,640
equation

36
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,880
we want to provide maximum value and

37
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,080
immediate returns

38
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,920
and help these smaller organizations

39
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:27,040
spend their scarce resources more wisely

40
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,840
and give them something they can use as

41
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,759
a baseline

42
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:34,159
why am i here because we're sick and

43
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:36,320
tired of hearing about this

44
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:39,759
i've been in healthcare infosec since

45
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:42,320
how i got started in this industry was

46
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:44,799
because i got rid of one of these people

47
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:47,200
and i repeated it at two larger

48
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,880
organizations and

49
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:52,240
part of the reason why i'm a ciso is

50
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:55,600
because i helped get rid of snake oil

51
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:56,320
providers

52
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:59,360
at several organizations so

53
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,439
what i have today is 22 years of

54
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:03,439
experience in a shortened format

55
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:05,280
designed to give an understanding of our

56
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,520
challenges and more importantly

57
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:10,160
what we can do to fight back and just an

58
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:10,800
fyi

59
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,120
you're going to see a lot of text here

60
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,640
and you're not going to see as many

61
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:15,599
memes for me as you

62
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:18,959
normally do why because i want to give

63
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:21,040
people viewing this presentation or

64
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,000
people that download

65
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
these slides something they can print

66
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,080
out and put on their desk

67
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:29,120
without worrying about if a picture of

68
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,000
tiger king

69
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,680
offends somebody so what assumptions are

70
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,120
we making

71
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,760
we're going to make five first we're

72
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,280
going to be talking about small medical

73
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,160
offices or

74
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:43,120
critical access hospitals second that

75
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,800
the person in charge of risk management

76
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:45,360
plans

77
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,440
not going to know computers well they

78
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:50,080
don't need to they don't have to

79
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,680
and we're gonna have computers accessing

80
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:54,480
a lot of on-site and off-site resources

81
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,480
with a lot of applications all with

82
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,800
different user names and passwords

83
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,120
and more importantly no one has a

84
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,800
hundred percent of a clue as to what is

85
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:03,680
going on

86
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:06,239
much like the old parable of the three

87
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:07,040
blind men

88
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:10,720
and the elephants so what's our agenda

89
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,000
today

90
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,040
we're going to talk about risk

91
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:16,480
assessments and there is a tool download

92
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,080
we have a quantitative risk assessment

93
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,920
tool we developed in excel

94
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,360
that we're going to make sure you can

95
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,360
download along with this

96
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,640
we're going to talk about how to use

97
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,400
that to develop the risk management plan

98
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,840
that you need

99
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,120
we're going to talk about policies and

100
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,120
procedures and how to develop them and

101
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,080
what you actually

102
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:34,080
need we're also going to talk about

103
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,159
physical security

104
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:37,040
then we're going to talk about the

105
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,799
healthcare isac and the health sector

106
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:40,000
coordinating council

107
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,840
who they are and what resources they

108
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:44,159
have that can help you

109
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:45,280
we're going to talk about electronic

110
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,680
medical records systems what to do to

111
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,519
maintain them and why

112
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:53,439
password managers uh pci dss

113
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:55,920
aka payment card industry data security

114
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,519
standards and why keeping up here is

115
00:03:57,519 --> 00:03:59,120
important

116
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,920
firewalls vpns and how not to make them

117
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,519
your worst enemy

118
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:04,799
we're also going to talk about the

119
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:06,640
zettabyte file system

120
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,799
and why you need this for local file

121
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:09,680
storage

122
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:12,000
and why it's very important and also

123
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,439
cloud-based backups

124
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:16,959
aka a good defense against ransomware

125
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:19,680
and our friends at samba why this works

126
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,759
for authentication

127
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:23,919
endpoint detection response why this

128
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:26,000
instead of antivirus

129
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,479
flash drive encryption good encrypted

130
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:29,440
email

131
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:32,800
good two-factor authentication our

132
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,960
friends at ct update with the wsus

133
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:35,919
offline update

134
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:38,320
or as we put it a friend of byod and a

135
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,160
friend of datacaps

136
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,320
how to handle vendor management with

137
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:45,040
again a free tool download from us

138
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,600
and a callback policy on cashback or

139
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,160
wire

140
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:52,160
transfers and we're going to sum up with

141
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,759
training that doesn't suck which is a

142
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:55,440
lot harder than it sounds

143
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,759
always having someone to call and of

144
00:04:57,759 --> 00:04:59,759
course thanking you for your time and

145
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:01,930
the opportunity to speak with you today

146
00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:03,120
[Music]

147
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:07,120
so risk assessments first things first

148
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,199
we always advocate doing these

149
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:10,960
internally with a little bit of outside

150
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,960
help instead of just having one done

151
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:15,360
by an outside firm reason why is you

152
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,479
need to know your business well

153
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:18,800
and know where your holes are and the

154
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,720
most critical part we found is to be

155
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:23,199
honest about your compliance status

156
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:25,199
truth is if you're not you're going to

157
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:26,720
get in trouble with the ocr

158
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:29,440
aka the office for civil rights from the

159
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,199
department of health and human services

160
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:33,360
and now your insurance company if you're

161
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,560
not

162
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,560
and this is not a death sentence this is

163
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,080
not an irs audit

164
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,160
the goal is to improve and i've even had

165
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:42,240
conversations with ocr about that

166
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,160
and more importantly the other reason

167
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,240
you want to do it internally

168
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,479
is because no one's going to tell an

169
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:49,680
outsider

170
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,680
where the security holes are or where

171
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:52,880
they think their issues are

172
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:55,600
why because people think outsider they

173
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:56,800
think an auditor

174
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:59,520
and if you bring in an outsider people

175
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:00,639
are going to clam up

176
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:03,840
and not say anything this is no knock on

177
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:06,160
the big firms i've worked with but

178
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:09,440
outsiders don't get answers insiders

179
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,919
do that's why you do it internally

180
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:12,960
because if you don't know where your

181
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,400
problems are you're not being honest

182
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,120
with yourself

183
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,720
and you're not leading to something that

184
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,840
can help develop a good risk management

185
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,000
plan

186
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,199
also we do it quantitatively the reason

187
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:24,960
why is because we have to prioritize how

188
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:25,759
we address

189
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:28,560
risks so part of our tool download is we

190
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,080
put one together

191
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,840
that was based on the cms systems

192
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,919
readiness assessment tool that does risk

193
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:34,960
evaluation

194
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:37,360
based upon factors of likelihood impact

195
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,479
velocity

196
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:40,639
potential income loss and reputational

197
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:42,160
impact

198
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,319
and what you end up with is for each of

199
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:45,440
your risks

200
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:48,479
a score and what do you do with these

201
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:50,560
scores because let me tell you

202
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,080
i first started off doing risk

203
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,599
assessments

204
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:56,800
i would see 50 or 60 low mediums or

205
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:57,680
highs

206
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,120
and you couldn't even know what to

207
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:02,240
prioritize and it ended up becoming a

208
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,880
qualitative not quantitative exercise so

209
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:05,919
this is why we do

210
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:09,520
things quantitative with scores why

211
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:10,880
because in the supplied spreadsheet

212
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,479
there's a pivot table for identifying

213
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:13,919
your top risks

214
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:16,720
and we do an internal rule called the 20

215
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:17,759
cutoff

216
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:19,440
reason being is we figured out that if

217
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,800
you do the top 20

218
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,360
you get most of the remaining 80 as part

219
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,960
of the plan

220
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,560
and what you do you don't have to be

221
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,479
technical you develop a set of methods

222
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:30,000
and processes to address them

223
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,479
as part of a plan and you always have to

224
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:34,080
include your communication plan this has

225
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,680
been the greatest failing i've found in

226
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,440
information security when you try to

227
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,560
address risk

228
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,319
you have to go out you have to talk to

229
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:42,240
people and you have to do this over and

230
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,879
over and over and over again

231
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:47,360
and be able to give a presentation and

232
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,039
with my team we call it the 30-second

233
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:50,319
rule

234
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:52,720
if you can't explain it in 30 seconds

235
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,319
and tie it back to the mission values of

236
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:55,599
the organization

237
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:56,879
and talk about how it benefits the

238
00:07:56,879 --> 00:07:59,360
organization you really shouldn't be

239
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,960
doing it

240
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,960
so we have to get down to that level

241
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,639
with our communication plans and talk

242
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:06,400
about why this is important

243
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,879
and most importantly assign accountable

244
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:10,160
parties to make sure

245
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,080
things get followed up on and keep

246
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,440
following up and documenting

247
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,840
keep a spreadsheet even the most

248
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,360
non-technical on the person

249
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:20,400
in the world can use microsoft excel or

250
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:24,160
libreoffice your choice

251
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,520
so brings us to our policies and

252
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,199
procedures and you need to have these

253
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:29,199
because they're required by the health

254
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:31,599
insurance portability and accountability

255
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:32,320
act

256
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:35,519
better known as hipaa no two-piece

257
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:38,640
and you should have these by identified

258
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,000
risk and develop and release

259
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,799
them in that order because if you try

260
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:44,399
and do this all at once and you don't do

261
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:46,560
it as part of your overall plan

262
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:49,440
or with the communication plan no one's

263
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,880
going to follow them

264
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,720
people are going to go well why am i

265
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,000
doing this policy

266
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,080
why do i care unless you tie it back to

267
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,440
identified risks with a good

268
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,640
communication plan

269
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:04,399
a policy ultimately means nothing

270
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:06,000
so we actually recommend the policy

271
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,440
template provided by the department of

272
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,120
health and human services and we provide

273
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,080
the link for you

274
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:13,600
right here so

275
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,120
bring up physical security as well and

276
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,800
this is something i found from numerous

277
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,800
risk assessments i've done

278
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,560
a lot of organizations treat building

279
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,560
management separate from the enterprise

280
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:25,040
aka i've had enough conversations with

281
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:26,399
executives where

282
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,800
i have been told we think physical

283
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,800
security is out of scope

284
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:33,600
well guess what we have an opioid crisis

285
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,200
it is

286
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,120
also what we found with physical

287
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,640
security and building management is the

288
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:39,839
equipment lives on much

289
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:42,000
longer life cycles that means while

290
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,760
we've done a great job with our desktops

291
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,680
and emrs

292
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:47,360
we have a lot of unpatched machines with

293
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,120
network access running older windows

294
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,040
versions that are running our physical

295
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,480
infrastructure

296
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,800
and realistically that amiga 2000 that

297
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,399
was running the hvac for a school

298
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:57,600
district in michigan

299
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,600
was more secure because it didn't have

300
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,200
internet access

301
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,720
yeah you could dial in but it was more

302
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,640
secure than being able to remote in off

303
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:05,600
the internet

304
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:08,480
and being able to change a build change

305
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,240
of buildings environmentals

306
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,760
i mean come on now call to the dead cow

307
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,360
did that 25 years ago

308
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:16,720
we should be guarding against that so

309
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,959
anything with a network connection that

310
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:20,800
protects data

311
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:23,120
or protects an environment is now in

312
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,160
scope

313
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:26,079
a lot of executives again when i first

314
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:27,600
started off in this business

315
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,720
tried to restrict scope to just the emr

316
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:33,519
but a good risk assessment showed that

317
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:36,240
physical security really wasn't scope

318
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,440
so you have to include these in your

319
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:40,480
risk assessments and protect adequately

320
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:43,279
because again everything's a whole and

321
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:44,480
we should have learned our lesson from

322
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:47,360
cdc when they did this

323
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,200
so brings us to a couple organizations

324
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,040
that can help out smaller organizations

325
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,880
so which are the healthcare isac and the

326
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:55,360
health sector coordinating council

327
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:57,440
put their links up here for you they

328
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,200
provide excellent content

329
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,880
mailing lists and threat intelligence

330
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,640
for healthcare organizations

331
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:05,200
and they actually and healthcare isac

332
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,240
has

333
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,839
actually some very reasonable pricing

334
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:09,680
now for smaller organizations

335
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:12,320
and the hscc provides significant

336
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:12,959
guidance

337
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:14,959
content recommendations and a lot of

338
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:16,640
coordination between members and a lot

339
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:16,880
of

340
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,800
in-person conferences and opportunities

341
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,959
to work with some great people in the

342
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:22,480
industry

343
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,240
so we highly recommend your small

344
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:27,839
organization join one or two of these

345
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:28,480
and we

346
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,399
highly recommend that more than spending

347
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:31,950
money on threat intel software

348
00:11:31,950 --> 00:11:33,360
[Music]

349
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:36,000
so brings me to emr maintenance let me

350
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:36,800
be very clear

351
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,880
if you're hosting an emr and you're a

352
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,079
small organization

353
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:43,040
don't right now they're getting so

354
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,720
complex that they're so expensive to

355
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:45,760
maintain

356
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:48,160
security is now very challenging you

357
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,600
have regulatory requirements that

358
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,040
require a team

359
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,800
and a bigger health system or a large

360
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,800
service bureau they can do this for you

361
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:55,600
and do it

362
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:58,079
better and tools such as privacy and

363
00:11:58,079 --> 00:11:59,440
diversion monitoring that a lot of

364
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,320
larger one hat

365
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,959
larger ones have they can also be

366
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:04,720
leveraged for your organization

367
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:08,240
as well so emrs are now incredibly

368
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:09,040
complex

369
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,240
there's a reason why a couple of the

370
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,959
largest dmr companies offer that remote

371
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:15,120
hosted option that's the way at the

372
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,360
future because doing it on your own

373
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:21,360
is an incredibly complex task

374
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:24,720
and brings me to password managers

375
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,959
i have worked in a lot of industries

376
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:27,920
mostly healthcare

377
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:31,120
mostly defense however no other industry

378
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:33,040
i've worked in has had an emphasis

379
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:36,079
on having numerous incompatible logins

380
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:40,160
dod went through this about 15 years ago

381
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,560
and dod got themselves mostly cleaned up

382
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:43,200
healthcare

383
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:46,240
hasn't why because healthcare has all

384
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,839
these different applications

385
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:49,360
and when you talk to the vendors about

386
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,279
federation or single cyan they look at

387
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:52,800
you like a dog

388
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:55,440
looking at a card trick what are you

389
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:56,880
talking about

390
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,000
what are you talking about i actually

391
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,959
have to do this what's saml

392
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:04,480
i wish i was kidding so this means

393
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:05,680
you've got to get very good with

394
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,279
password managers and make sure your

395
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:08,000
team

396
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,720
knows how to use them even the one in

397
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:11,680
google chrome

398
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,360
is a significant improvement over what

399
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,959
we have now

400
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:16,800
and is now an absolute must for your

401
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,320
team members to have

402
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,399
and again when most of the applications

403
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:21,760
that we have in healthcare can actually

404
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,519
use google chrome it'll be a great

405
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:24,959
benefit you still have a significant

406
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:25,760
amount running on

407
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:28,000
internet explorer which has been

408
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,200
replaced what twice now

409
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,760
so brings me to another point here

410
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,519
brings me over to payment card industry

411
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:37,519
data security standards

412
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:40,480
very few people pay cash for the doctor

413
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:41,600
anymore

414
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:45,440
maybe in some more rural areas or with

415
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,680
quite frankly the amish don't pay cash

416
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:50,639
but very few other people will

417
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:52,720
so many of the credit card machines in

418
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:53,920
your doctor's office

419
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:56,240
have not kept up with the times because

420
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:58,160
people think pci compliance is

421
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:01,279
one and done so big hand for you

422
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:03,920
it isn't and that pci compliant device

423
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:06,079
that's pci 2.0 compliant

424
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:08,480
doesn't take chip cards and one of the

425
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,160
areas where you're going to find

426
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:13,199
is customer demand people

427
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:15,199
want their credit cards to work like

428
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:18,399
they do at walmart or cvs

429
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:20,000
and i've actually heard customer

430
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,399
complaints about this

431
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:24,000
they want the walmart experience they

432
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
want the cvs experience

433
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,519
they want their chip card working and

434
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:28,880
they really care about credit card

435
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,560
security

436
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,160
so what you want to do is talk to your

437
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:33,760
bank talk to your app vendors

438
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:35,440
get the latest point-to-point encryption

439
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,519
devices in your practice

440
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:40,800
literally they will give them to you

441
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,639
however you need to have someone that

442
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:44,160
just goes around checks the device

443
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:44,800
quarterly

444
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,040
and makes sure they stay updated that

445
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:48,160
way you can actually have some

446
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:50,160
reasonable degree of pci compliance and

447
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:52,560
also if you get p2p

448
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,000
that means you take your network pretty

449
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
much out of scope for anything you do

450
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,120
with pci compliance and more importantly

451
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:02,320
you protect your patient's credit cards

452
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:03,519
because you want to violate someone's

453
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:06,800
trust have a couple thousand dollars

454
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,880
of pc components show up under credit

455
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,800
card after they go to your office

456
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:14,480
we want to avoid that also

457
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:17,839
want to talk about patient payments

458
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:19,519
this is at the point where if you're

459
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:21,920
doing this on your own you shouldn't

460
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,360
get a hold of one of the revenue cycle

461
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:24,560
vendors out there to handle your

462
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,720
payments and provide that patient portal

463
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:29,680
don't assume that risk don't try and

464
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:32,240
waste time trying to be pci compliant

465
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,839
you also don't want to be in a position

466
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:35,120
where you're writing down credit card

467
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:37,199
numbers or recording them on voicemails

468
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:39,279
both of which affect your pci compliance

469
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:40,800
status

470
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:44,160
realistically i believe in risk

471
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:46,160
transference by paying for a pc

472
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:47,120
compliant vendor

473
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:49,279
is the best move an organization can

474
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:51,040
make because again when you think about

475
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:52,959
it you think about the little things

476
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:54,240
somebody sees a credit card number

477
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,600
written down and they're not exactly

478
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:56,560
scrupulous

479
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:57,920
they're gonna copy down that credit card

480
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,320
number or if they hear a voicemail

481
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:01,759
because someone has a

482
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:03,680
old voicemail password that is on the

483
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:04,880
wall

484
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:07,279
they'll copy down the credit card number

485
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:08,000
we want to

486
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,360
avoid credit card fraud and this is how

487
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,160
you do it

488
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:13,360
there's a lot of companies out there

489
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:15,839
that do great work they'll do it for you

490
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:17,040
at a reasonable price

491
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:18,480
and provide you something reasonably

492
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:23,279
decent for pci compliance and this is

493
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:25,040
my favorite statement i've heard this

494
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:27,120
statement for the past 20 years

495
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:30,800
but we have a firewall truth is with a

496
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,079
lot of ransomware attacks that have been

497
00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:32,639
happening

498
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:36,480
you open up port 3389 aka remote desktop

499
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,720
you might as well not have a firewall

500
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,240
and if you didn't patch it you might as

501
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,600
well not have one

502
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,519
so one of the most important lessons we

503
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:45,600
learned over the past year is that

504
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,920
remote access is a huge target and

505
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:49,120
there's actually been numerous

506
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,720
successful attacks on both remote

507
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:51,839
desktop

508
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:55,440
and unpatched vpn software

509
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:56,639
and again what we talked to our

510
00:16:56,639 --> 00:16:58,720
customers about continually

511
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,480
is that same appliance that worked five

512
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:02,320
years ago is not effective against

513
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,680
modern threats

514
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:06,240
so this got exacerbated in a number of

515
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:08,240
organizations when people realized hey

516
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:09,919
guess what i'm working from home

517
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:11,760
my spouse is working from home and my

518
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,599
kids are doing e-learning

519
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:15,599
and that router i got five years ago for

520
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:17,280
wireless that i haven't changed

521
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:21,199
guess what it's dying same thing

522
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:23,280
happens with a lot of modern offices as

523
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:24,720
we switch to remote

524
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:28,319
we killed remote access and the only

525
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:30,240
people that really benefited from this

526
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:32,880
were the pump companies reselling all

527
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:35,039
the new equipment to people because the

528
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:37,440
old stuff just didn't work

529
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,200
i'll be very clear about something else

530
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,440
straight remote desktop is not effective

531
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:44,000
you will get owned blue keeper not you

532
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,440
will get owned

533
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:48,000
so don't use it you've got your rds

534
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,120
gateways

535
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:51,919
good solution you've got openvpn on pf

536
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:52,640
sense on a

537
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:55,600
on that core 2 duo from 2006 that's

538
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,039
going to do a better job than most of

539
00:17:57,039 --> 00:17:58,400
your appliances

540
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,320
even google remote desktop protects you

541
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:02,720
better that's got two factor

542
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:05,760
and if you run rdp or old vpn we learned

543
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,840
a very important lesson okovid

544
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:10,000
say hello to ransomware because guess

545
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,190
what you're going to get it

546
00:18:12,190 --> 00:18:13,280
[Music]

547
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:17,039
so brings me to another point here

548
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:18,799
one of my areas of focus over the past

549
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:21,840
few years of my research has been

550
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:25,360
hipaa aka confidentiality integrity and

551
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:26,880
availability of data

552
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:29,039
so what have we done a lot of over the

553
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:30,080
past year

554
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:32,640
confidentiality and availability why

555
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:33,679
because we need to

556
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:36,720
securely get access to equipment

557
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,160
we need to be able to do our jobs

558
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:40,320
remotely and a lot of people have

559
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:40,720
assumed

560
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,720
integrity comes with the use of secure

561
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,960
transport protocols like tls

562
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:48,080
well that's not really the case we also

563
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:49,600
have to worry about integrity

564
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:53,280
why i'm going to go into a real use case

565
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:56,240
i got from work we have patients that

566
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:56,559
need

567
00:18:56,559 --> 00:18:59,360
30 to 40 years of medical records

568
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:01,360
normally we talk about people needing 10

569
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:02,240
years and most

570
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:04,320
regulations out there talk about oh you

571
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:05,440
need to keep them

572
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:08,240
as much as clinically effective well

573
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:10,000
when somebody gets pediatric

574
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,320
craniofacial surgery to affect the shape

575
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:14,000
of their skull

576
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,600
guess what you need to keep 40 years of

577
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,280
medical records around

578
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:18,799
and the probability this data becoming

579
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:20,320
corrupt over the years is

580
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:24,160
very very high and give you a perfect

581
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,280
example of it

582
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:27,840
2000 i was sitting having a conversation

583
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:29,600
with my cousin my cousin

584
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:32,640
is a surgeon in hackensack new jersey

585
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:35,440
and he was talking to me about how he

586
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:36,840
prints out photos

587
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:39,919
and keeps them in a photo album i'm like

588
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:42,080
sydney why are you doing that man he

589
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:43,919
goes because 20 years from now i want to

590
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:44,799
be able to read them

591
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:47,200
and i don't know if i'm going to be able

592
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,880
to

593
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:51,840
so that thought from my cousin sid has

594
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:52,400
stuck

595
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:55,600
in my head and has actually

596
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:58,720
been a determinant in how i act because

597
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:01,360
realistically i have to make sure now

598
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:02,960
that the files that

599
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,559
we keep on patients especially those

600
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:06,159
that are going to need it 40 years from

601
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:07,520
now because

602
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:10,159
a surgeon is going to need to see the

603
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:11,840
results of a skull surgery from back

604
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:12,480
then

605
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:15,919
becomes very important so integrity is

606
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:17,919
no longer just transport protocols we

607
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:19,520
talk about file corruption and file

608
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:20,480
integrity

609
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:22,400
and many of the common file systems

610
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:25,039
don't do it at the file level

611
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:27,760
however there's a lot that runs zfs that

612
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:28,640
do

613
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,320
and they do a lot of check summing on

614
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:31,919
files that helps you detect

615
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:34,480
and correct that and there's a lot that

616
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:35,280
you can get

617
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:37,039
not from a lot of larger companies but

618
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:38,559
you can get them

619
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:42,240
that can protect those files

620
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,559
so brings me to another point here which

621
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:45,360
is about

622
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:47,039
cloud-based backups and why you need

623
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:49,360
them so i've had the opportunity over

624
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:50,320
the past

625
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:52,240
couple years to do several presentations

626
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:53,679
with steve long who happens to be the

627
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:55,360
ceo of hancock regional health in

628
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:56,960
hancock indiana

629
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:59,919
aka probably the only health system

630
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:00,400
that's

631
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,799
openly talked about what happened with

632
00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:04,720
their ransomware attack and has gone on

633
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:06,799
record with doing so

634
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:09,440
so they actually came right out and said

635
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:11,440
this is why we paid

636
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:13,360
we paid because it came down to recovery

637
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:15,039
time and getting systems back to take

638
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:16,720
care of patients

639
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,559
so if and when you get attacked and more

640
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:20,320
than likely it's going to be when not if

641
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,799
you need to protect those backups and i

642
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:24,240
can also tell you i

643
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,720
work on cyber insurance policies as part

644
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:28,240
of my job

645
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:30,240
and one of the major insurance brokers

646
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:32,159
now has a ransomware addendum

647
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:35,520
to their policy writer that specifically

648
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:36,000
asks

649
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,760
how you store your backups and if you

650
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:39,600
store them separately under a different

651
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,440
set of credentials and they also ask if

652
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:43,039
you test them

653
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:45,919
why because numerous ransomware actors

654
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:46,960
figured out

655
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:49,360
hey you store the backups on the network

656
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:51,919
and encrypt them first

657
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:54,559
so your average cloud provider that has

658
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:55,200
good

659
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:58,240
hipaa backups as they call them

660
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:59,679
they're going to have better security

661
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:01,520
but again the insurance companies are

662
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:01,919
getting

663
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:04,960
really smart about this as well so get

664
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:09,039
smart along with the insurance companies

665
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:12,880
so brings me to samba

666
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:16,240
many apps we have still require ad

667
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:17,280
authentication

668
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:20,640
it's a fact of life realistically

669
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,080
you don't need to have a full led

670
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:23,760
environment you can run

671
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:26,240
if you need to run it run a small vm run

672
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:27,760
your samba

673
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:29,280
easy it's pretty easy to integrate with

674
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:31,360
your nas appliances and windows

675
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:33,679
and honestly saves you some money on

676
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:36,559
microsoft licensing

677
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:39,600
so brings me to secure email we need to

678
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,840
be able to send email to patients

679
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:43,280
and you can't make the assumption you're

680
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:44,880
going to read on anything remotely

681
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,159
secure

682
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:47,520
and i'm going to come right out and say

683
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:49,679
this the secure portal apps that i use

684
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:51,280
right now do not support patient

685
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:53,679
satisfaction

686
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:57,360
i have twins my twins

687
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:00,640
let's be honest you get twins they have

688
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:02,559
health issues

689
00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:05,679
they have to see lots of specialists and

690
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:06,559
i remember

691
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:09,600
with my wife having to

692
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,840
deal with a couple of secure email

693
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:13,600
systems for specialists we were sending

694
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,840
my son to

695
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:18,960
and i remember my wife getting upset

696
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:21,440
and basically me trying to read through

697
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:23,440
a secure email provided by a major

698
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:24,799
children's hospital

699
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:26,159
made me want to throw the computer at

700
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:28,799
the wall because it was the complicating

701
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:30,480
factor of

702
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:33,360
i'm worried about my kids my wife is

703
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:35,200
sitting there worried which

704
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:40,320
amplifies my amplifies my worry factor

705
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:43,440
probably a hundred fold and complicating

706
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:44,960
it with a bad user interface or bad

707
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:46,240
secure email

708
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:49,039
that's not good this is an area we need

709
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:50,799
to improve and i'll be honest about

710
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:51,360
something else

711
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:53,279
providers don't read multiple inboxes

712
00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:54,880
they read one

713
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,960
why because they don't have time to read

714
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:58,240
anything other than

715
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:00,880
the one i've worked with doctors for

716
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:02,480
over 20 years

717
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:05,120
and i can tell you after having numerous

718
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:06,960
stand-up meetings in clinics

719
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:08,640
literally running with them from place

720
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:10,720
to place

721
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:12,400
assuming they're going to read multi

722
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,640
more than one place to do anything

723
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:16,960
is a failed assumption and the current

724
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:18,640
vertical solutions in addition to having

725
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,400
user interfaces that make

726
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:23,520
patients and providers angry they are

727
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:24,559
very expensive

728
00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:26,240
so you stick with good secure providers

729
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:27,919
that provide the encryption mobile

730
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:29,600
access and a simple secure

731
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:33,120
portal you don't need to have the

732
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:35,520
quote unquote hipaa porsche package and

733
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:37,039
quite frankly

734
00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:39,679
most of your patients don't care because

735
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:40,799
what's going to happen is they're going

736
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:42,320
to copy and paste the information

737
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:45,440
somewhere anyway so give them

738
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:47,600
a good basic thing that works that

739
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,120
you've tested

740
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:52,240
use that and if you try and

741
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:54,159
force a user interface on someone and

742
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:55,279
say hipaa

743
00:24:55,279 --> 00:24:57,600
no one's gonna care they're gonna find a

744
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:01,840
way around it anyway

745
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:05,279
so when it comes to edr i'll be very

746
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:07,200
clear about something else

747
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:10,000
anti-virus in healthcare is doa why

748
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,279
because there's too much interference

749
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:12,960
with applications

750
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:15,039
and most of your software packages out

751
00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:16,960
there in health care

752
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:20,640
that run come with an exceptions list

753
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,559
which means that it takes me about 30

754
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:23,840
seconds on google to

755
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:25,760
find the exceptions list to know where i

756
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:28,640
can place custom malware

757
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:31,200
so you want to get rid of the ability

758
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:32,320
for the exceptions

759
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:35,120
to run that's why we like edr better it

760
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:36,960
also integrates better with sims and log

761
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:37,919
management

762
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:39,840
integrates with tools like os query to

763
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,760
provide your good analytics

764
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:43,279
and you're spending less time figuring

765
00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:44,559
out why your apps don't work because of

766
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:46,240
an exceptions list

767
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:48,559
and making exceptions that quite frankly

768
00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:50,799
give an open door for malware because if

769
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:53,039
i know where your where your av

770
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:54,880
program's not going to scan

771
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:56,960
where do you think i'm going to put the

772
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:59,600
malware

773
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:02,320
and major challenge i have of flash

774
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:03,200
drives

775
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:06,480
has been proprietary drives so

776
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:09,600
four years ago i left my job at temple

777
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:11,039
health

778
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:12,880
i had a bunch of photos stored on one of

779
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,320
my computers there

780
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:16,400
including the photo of the photos of the

781
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,640
birth of my kids

782
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:20,559
and i needed to transport those in an

783
00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:22,799
encrypted flash drive

784
00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:26,080
well home so i did

785
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:29,440
and when i upgraded to mac os high

786
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:30,080
sierra

787
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:32,159
last year i realized i got a warning

788
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:34,880
that said oh the application you use

789
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:37,120
is no longer go for decrypting your

790
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:38,480
flash drive isn't going to work

791
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:41,919
with future mac os upgrades so i had to

792
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:42,240
go

793
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:45,760
and take 26 gigs of photos and transport

794
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:46,080
them

795
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:48,159
somewhere else which was a major

796
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:50,159
challenge for me

797
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:51,760
and for a lot of people there is not

798
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:53,440
going to do it

799
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:55,440
and also we bring up significant churn

800
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:56,799
in the encryption vendor market which

801
00:26:56,799 --> 00:26:58,240
means that that data you

802
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:00,559
have now isn't going to be decryptable

803
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:02,320
10 years later because of a lot of os

804
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:03,600
constraints

805
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:05,919
so realistically open source solutions

806
00:27:05,919 --> 00:27:07,360
work because at least

807
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:08,960
you're going to have a better chance of

808
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,960
reading your data with a solution that's

809
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:11,600
kept up

810
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:14,240
and kept maintained i've used a lot of

811
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:15,919
proprietary encryption software out

812
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:16,320
there

813
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:18,320
and i can tell you the open source stuff

814
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:21,600
still works and the proprietary stuff

815
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:25,760
well i might be able to read it one day

816
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:27,600
so it brings me over to two factor and

817
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:29,279
if there's one factor to stop the

818
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:30,880
majority of hack attempts

819
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:32,880
it's good two-factor authentication like

820
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:35,840
duo authy or yubi keys

821
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:38,720
all of which work very very well and

822
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:40,399
this is especially true for healthcare

823
00:27:40,399 --> 00:27:41,760
and again part of my background i've

824
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:43,200
been doing the ciso thing

825
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:46,240
for 12 years in healthcare a number of

826
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:47,679
the phishing attacks

827
00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:50,720
that we use that we've seen

828
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:53,919
they use compromised accounts why

829
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:56,559
because it gives that illusion of trust

830
00:27:56,559 --> 00:27:58,640
and so what happens

831
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:00,640
the attacks that i've seen very

832
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,240
specifically somebody gets a hold of

833
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:03,600
compromise credentials from another

834
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:04,640
health system

835
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:07,279
they spam every health system account

836
00:28:07,279 --> 00:28:07,760
they

837
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:10,559
got and they do it via the secured email

838
00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:12,640
system so it bypasses your anti-spam

839
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,320
protection and quite frankly

840
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:17,120
bypasses your email border gateways

841
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:19,039
because it it'll literally

842
00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:21,120
drop it in right at the internal mail

843
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:22,640
gateways

844
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:24,559
which is not good because it means

845
00:28:24,559 --> 00:28:25,840
you've bypassed a whole bunch of

846
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:27,039
protection

847
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:30,320
and also these print

848
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:32,559
not these non-two-factor provide access

849
00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:33,679
to internal networks for

850
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:36,960
further analysis recon etc yeah we've

851
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:37,520
seen it

852
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:41,200
and it is a gateway to ransomware

853
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:43,440
so another thing we've done to talk

854
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:44,320
about how to

855
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:48,240
block this is the wsus offline updates

856
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:50,480
so one thing we've had to do is if you

857
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:52,399
get a device out there that

858
00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:55,360
you've got a quickly patch you have two

859
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:56,000
choices

860
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,640
either you could wait for all the online

861
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:00,640
update tools and kill your bandwidth or

862
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:02,480
you could put it on a flash drive put it

863
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:03,039
in

864
00:29:03,039 --> 00:29:06,399
and go do something else we choose to

865
00:29:06,399 --> 00:29:07,919
put it in quickly and go do something

866
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:11,840
else and get the machine up and patched

867
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:13,360
a lot of devices that come out there

868
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:15,200
don't come in the latest patches

869
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:16,480
you want to put something on the network

870
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:18,240
quickly put this on

871
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:19,840
get the patches on and i'm not talking

872
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:23,120
just desktop pcs i'm talking

873
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:26,240
very huge expensive devices

874
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:29,279
that do support microsoft patches this

875
00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:31,440
works better than anything i've used and

876
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:34,399
i've been doing this for 20 years

877
00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:36,640
so brings me over to our friend mr

878
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:38,080
vendor management

879
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:40,799
or miss vendor management you need to

880
00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:43,279
perform risk analysis of your vendors

881
00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:46,720
so big problem we have here and i've

882
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:49,039
had numerous discussions with most of

883
00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:49,760
the

884
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:52,000
big medical device vendors out there is

885
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,200
there are

886
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:55,919
a huge amount of divergent requirements

887
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:57,520
out there because

888
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:59,520
the regulations talk about having your

889
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:02,240
requirements they don't say how

890
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:04,240
they talk about how to do it but they

891
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:05,360
don't actually provide good

892
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:07,200
implementation steps

893
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:09,440
so another gift we're giving you today

894
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:11,039
is use ours

895
00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:12,880
we put ours up on the internet you can

896
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:14,960
download them you can use them

897
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:16,559
everyone from small providers some of

898
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:17,919
the largest health care systems in the

899
00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:18,320
world

900
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:21,520
use ours why because a lot of vendors

901
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:24,320
are not going to answer questionnaires

902
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:26,399
and the truth is is that they've been

903
00:30:26,399 --> 00:30:28,000
getting a ton of questionnaires

904
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,679
they've had to dedicate numerous

905
00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:32,080
resources to literally answer the same

906
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:32,720
questions

907
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:35,919
over and over and over again and those

908
00:30:35,919 --> 00:30:37,679
are resources that are being taken

909
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:40,799
from actually securing the products

910
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:42,399
however a lot more of these vendors are

911
00:30:42,399 --> 00:30:43,840
getting certified

912
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:45,840
and it makes our job easier if they go

913
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:47,440
for different certification

914
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:49,200
criteria works really well for us

915
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:51,520
actually

916
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:53,520
so brings me to something else and i

917
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:54,880
know sounds like i'm jumping around a

918
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:56,159
little bit

919
00:30:56,159 --> 00:30:58,399
but this all fits together so talk about

920
00:30:58,399 --> 00:31:00,080
a callback policy

921
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:03,519
so at this point coming back with

922
00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:05,200
account compromise everything else

923
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:06,960
no one should be allowing wire transfers

924
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:08,880
about an established relationship

925
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:10,799
speaking with these people on the phone

926
00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:12,720
and having someone confirm

927
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:15,120
even if internal with the supposed

928
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:16,960
executive asking for the rush wire

929
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:18,799
transfer to hong kong

930
00:31:18,799 --> 00:31:20,559
and confirm the changes to someone

931
00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:21,840
trusted

932
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:23,679
every attack we've seen relies upon

933
00:31:23,679 --> 00:31:26,320
impersonation of trusted executives

934
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:28,480
to coerce people into sending money

935
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:30,000
because

936
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,880
they are busy in a meeting and they need

937
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:33,679
that money

938
00:31:33,679 --> 00:31:35,679
now and yes it does have to go to hong

939
00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:38,159
kong so we're very clear about having

940
00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:40,640
that callback policy in place

941
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:42,399
and we've found it actually reduces your

942
00:31:42,399 --> 00:31:46,000
bec's by almost 100 percent

943
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
which brings me to training because

944
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,600
again getting people trained on that

945
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:52,159
leads to good training elsewhere

946
00:31:52,159 --> 00:31:54,320
i'm going to be very clear about this

947
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:56,399
most security training

948
00:31:56,399 --> 00:32:00,080
sucks and the customers hate it

949
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:02,080
and i've heard it from the c-suite all

950
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:04,960
the way down to the hourly employees

951
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:07,200
unless it directly ties into their job

952
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:08,559
or affects them

953
00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:10,960
they're not going to care so what we do

954
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:12,720
about it is we keep it short

955
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:15,360
sweet and relevant my goal when a

956
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:17,919
security advisory comes out is 200 words

957
00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:21,200
at most and discuss what people need to

958
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:22,159
do

959
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:25,200
and truth be told i had a case last week

960
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:27,039
where a warning came out from a federal

961
00:32:27,039 --> 00:32:28,000
agency

962
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,440
it didn't talk about what people needed

963
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:31,200
to do we took

964
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:32,480
the four pages from the government

965
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:35,440
warning turned it into 85 words

966
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:37,679
and we took the rest of the wording to

967
00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:39,279
put wording at the end

968
00:32:39,279 --> 00:32:41,360
for people needed to do about sim

969
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:42,559
swapping

970
00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:45,760
did that in a hundred words so in 200

971
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:46,320
words

972
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:48,399
we got the point across about sim

973
00:32:48,399 --> 00:32:50,240
swapping and what people needed to do

974
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:52,399
and provided relevant action

975
00:32:52,399 --> 00:32:55,120
and a callback for if you have further

976
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:56,080
questions contact

977
00:32:56,080 --> 00:33:00,080
us and we helped numerous people protect

978
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:02,399
their accounts against sim swapping

979
00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:05,600
that is relevance and also if you make

980
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:07,120
your training longer than three to five

981
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:09,120
minutes you will lose people

982
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:10,799
i have had this discussion with someone

983
00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:12,320
who really knows we're talking about

984
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:14,240
who is dr michelle janney our chief

985
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:16,080
operating officer

986
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:18,640
and when we did our training at my

987
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:20,159
organization

988
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:21,600
she is the first person i sent the

989
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:24,159
training to because i kept it to that

990
00:33:24,159 --> 00:33:25,360
parameter

991
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:28,399
long as she approved i was happy but

992
00:33:28,399 --> 00:33:29,200
again

993
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:31,600
this is what we talk about you make it

994
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:33,600
long you lose people

995
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:35,440
anytime you put a policy out it will

996
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:36,640
come with a training plan

997
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:38,240
it will come with a communication plan

998
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:40,320
because if you don't you will lose

999
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:41,120
people

1000
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,559
because people aren't going to know what

1001
00:33:42,559 --> 00:33:44,240
to do and they're not going to be able

1002
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:46,399
to get the 200 word explanation

1003
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:48,559
again ties back to the 30 second

1004
00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:51,679
michigan values that we always do

1005
00:33:51,679 --> 00:33:53,519
and also you've always got to be

1006
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:55,360
available

1007
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:57,120
make sure that you or your trusted team

1008
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:58,640
members are available because when

1009
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:00,080
something happens

1010
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:02,720
people are having a very bad day and i'm

1011
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:04,399
going to be very clear about this

1012
00:34:04,399 --> 00:34:06,799
do not be the condescending edge lord do

1013
00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:08,560
not be the bofh

1014
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:11,599
do not be the gatekeeper you will upset

1015
00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:13,599
people you will find yourself out of a

1016
00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:15,119
job

1017
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:17,359
always respond to your customer requests

1018
00:34:17,359 --> 00:34:19,520

00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:07,920
i'll put the link in there put a link in

1052
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:10,560
here i just actually had a book come out

1053
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:13,839
not so long ago

1054
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:18,400
so i can get that really quickly for you

1055
00:36:24,839 --> 00:36:27,839
memorize

1056
00:36:33,839 --> 00:36:38,320
okay so in the chat i just put a link to

1057
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:39,760
a book i just did a chapter on

1058
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:41,359
healthcare information security for that

1059
00:36:41,359 --> 00:36:42,960
covers

1060
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:44,640
that and so i have a question from

1061
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:46,000
robert wright

1062
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:49,599
and that question is

1063
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:51,200
what are some warning signs that you may

1064
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:53,280
have snake oily in your midst

1065
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:56,720
and the biggest answer

1066
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:59,839
i can give you is

1067
00:36:59,839 --> 00:37:01,359
if someone says they can try and solve

1068
00:37:01,359 --> 00:37:03,440
all your problems for you instantly

1069
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:06,079
that's how you know you've got snake oil

1070
00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:08,079
or someone claims to fix everything

1071
00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:10,880
without talking to you or analyzing or

1072
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:12,400
trying to meet your needs

1073
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:14,960
that is the number one largest sign i'd

1074
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:15,839
say about 80

1075
00:37:15,839 --> 00:37:19,440
of the cases that seems to be the most

1076
00:37:20,839 --> 00:37:23,839
effective

1077
00:37:23,839 --> 00:37:27,440
so i've in the question area some more

1078
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:29,200
i've been answering the questions in in

1079
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:31,839
line as well

1080
00:37:31,839 --> 00:37:35,040
so answer peter salas answer ask a

1081
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:36,320
question does hipaa have a set of

1082
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:37,680
standards that drive configuration

1083
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:39,119
baselines for the different health

1084
00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:40,320
industries

1085
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:42,960
and the answer that question is no it's

1086
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:43,520
pretty much

1087
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:46,880
one set of standards for

1088
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:50,000
everybody and

1089
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,160
for david brabroski who asked a question

1090
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:53,440
how do you get around antivirus

1091
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:54,960
requirements out of things such as

1092
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:56,800
disa stigs that require it instead of an

1093
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:58,800
edr that provides more value exceptions

1094
00:37:58,800 --> 00:37:59,920
to baselines

1095
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:01,760
what have you seen as successful methods

1096
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:03,040
for this shift

1097
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:04,480
i get on the phone with the vendors and

1098
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:06,480
flat out tell them we're using edr

1099
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:09,280
we're not using it

1100
00:38:11,839 --> 00:38:14,960
any issues with io

1101
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:19,040
so the answer to there and the excel

1102
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:19,520

1112
00:38:44,839 --> 00:38:47,839
answered

1113
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:56,000

1114
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
pretty funny so anyone else anyone else

1115
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,359
have any ques any more questions they

1116
00:38:59,359 --> 00:39:00,480
want to ask um

1117
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:02,560
look i'm i'm monitoring the question box

1118
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:04,960
right here

1119
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:14,720
okay so stephanie stephanie domes last

1120
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:16,800
question what is the correct balance

1121
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:17,280
between

1122
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:19,040
processed people and tools in cyber

1123
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:20,480
security

1124
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:22,160
your topic approaches cleaning up snake

1125
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:24,720
oil this likely applies mostly to tools

1126
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:26,320
any wording of the right balance between

1127
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:27,119
the three

1128
00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:29,119
i often see more of an emphasis on tools

1129
00:39:29,119 --> 00:39:31,119
than the other two than the other two

1130
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:34,480
and my emphasis this is always universal

1131
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:37,839
always start with a good risk assessment

1132
00:39:37,839 --> 00:39:41,119
and any tool you get has to come

1133
00:39:41,119 --> 00:39:44,000
with a plan for people and processes to

1134
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,240
maintain it

1135
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:48,320
so eric van gaal what are aspects of

1136
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:50,160
clinical applications that you look for

1137
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:51,599
during purchase decisions

1138
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:55,040
from a security point of view answered

1139
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:55,520
there

1140
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:57,839
is i want to make sure that the vendor

1141
00:39:57,839 --> 00:39:59,640
has a commitment to address

1142
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:02,240
vulnerabilities that they have an

1143
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:04,079
emphasis on staying current and most

1144
00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:05,440
importantly that they keep the lines of

1145
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:06,319
communication

1146
00:40:06,319 --> 00:40:09,839
open is urgent

1147
00:40:09,839 --> 00:40:11,200
you very much i'll stick around in a

1148
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:16,640
chat box to answer more questions
