1
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:03,280
all right well

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:05,680
good morning everyone uh my name is

3
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:07,919
chris krebs i'm the director of the

4
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:09,519
cyber security and infrastructure

5
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:10,880
security agency at the department of

6
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:12,080
homeland security

7
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:16,160
i hope you're enjoying the simulated uh

8
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:18,320
virtual black hat i know we're all

9
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:19,760
disappointed that we're not in las vegas

10
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:20,640
this year

11
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:23,279
instead i'm coming to you live from or

12
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:24,560
taped rather

13
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:27,119
from spring vegas virginia springfield

14
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:28,000
virginia

15
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
uh try to make this as real as possible

16
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,079
so last night i skipped dinner

17
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:33,920
uh stayed until 5am smoked a pack of

18
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:35,440
cigarettes drank a bunch of red bull

19
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:36,399
flushed much more

20
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:37,840
money down the toilet then i got up and

21
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:39,680
i walked five miles down here

22
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:42,559
in 90 degree heat so i'm feeling vegas

23
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:44,559
right now hopefully uh the rest of the

24
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:46,320
content will come across

25
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:49,360
so uh cisa uh we're the youngest federal

26
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:52,239
uh agency we're responsible for civilian

27
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:54,239
cyber security and that includes leading

28
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:55,120
the nation's

29
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:56,640
critical infrastructure protection

30
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:57,920
activities what i'm going to talk to you

31
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:59,280
about today

32
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,640
are efforts to secure federal elections

33
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,199
election security a pretty significant

34
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:06,880
undertaking right now

35
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:10,080
with uh the 2020 election just a few

36
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,760
months away at this point

37
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:14,000
what i want to talk about is where we

38
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,920
were in 2016

39
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:19,040
where we are today in the run up to 2020

40
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:20,080
and then talk about what we actually

41
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,119
have to do to get

42
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:23,759
ready left to get ready for 2020 and

43
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:25,200
then beyond

44
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,320
so let me start with 2016. so just about

45
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,079
this time four years ago

46
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:33,360
june july august it was becoming readily

47
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:33,920
apparent

48
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:37,520
very clear that russia was intent on

49
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:38,560
disrupting

50
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:41,360
the 2016 election through a variety of

51
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:42,320
techniques

52
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:44,799
cyber security targeting election

53
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:45,840
infrastructure

54
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,159
hack and leak attacks on political

55
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:49,200
campaigns

56
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,200
and launching a broader influence and

57
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,119
disinformation operation

58
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:54,880
so in response the federal government

59
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,240
mobilized

60
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:58,719
but i think if you talk to anybody that

61
00:01:58,719 --> 00:01:59,680
was

62
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:02,799
in my seat or comparative roles in the

63
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:04,000
last administration

64
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,520
i don't think anybody would necessarily

65
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,920
have been happy with the constructs with

66
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,280
the mechanisms

67
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,120
that they had ready to get go so so

68
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:14,080
really there are three elements of 2016

69
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,319
that i think are important to keep keep

70
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:17,599
in mind first is

71
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:20,000
again there was an ad hoc response that

72
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,520
was pulled together

73
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,280
just based on a lack of existing

74
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,440
structures nothing wrong with that

75
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:28,239
it just wasn't a top priority at the

76
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:29,840
time because it wasn't clear that there

77
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:30,720
was a threat

78
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:33,680
prior to last summer or to that summer

79
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,200
second

80
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,440
well just to be frank the russians

81
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,560
likely targeted

82
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,480
all 50 states it wasn't one state it

83
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:43,200
wasn't two states it wasn't swing states

84
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,760
they did research on all 50 states so

85
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:46,400
this was a

86
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,040
broad campaign and then i think the

87
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,319
third thing to keep in mind

88
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:52,480
the most important likely is that

89
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:53,760
there's no information

90
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,440
based on what's available to us that

91
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,519
they were able to affect

92
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:00,800
a single vote to change a single vote

93
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:03,040
through cyber security or cyber means

94
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,000
nothing's changed on that

95
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,319
front honestly we still don't have any

96
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:07,040
information

97
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,239
intelligence otherwise that would

98
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:09,840
suggest that they're in a position or

99
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,840
have a capability to do that

100
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:15,040
so let's roll it back why was it an ad

101
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,000
hoc response

102
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,640
well again there wasn't a dedicated

103
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:19,920
approach

104
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:22,400
written down on a piece of paper

105
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,239
historically on election security

106
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:25,760
the security research community

107
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,360
particularly the bubba's

108
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,519
that would typically be down the street

109
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:30,480
at def con

110
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,959
in the villages sure absolutely they've

111
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:35,040
been aware of risks to voting equipment

112
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,560
for a decade or more

113
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,400
but again there were no dedicated

114
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,560
structures mechanisms

115
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,440
ice acts for election security purposes

116
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,040
so they pulled something together

117
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:48,400
dhs the fbi the intelligence community

118
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,920
nsa and others

119
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:52,319
got what they could pulled it together

120
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:53,599
and launched what

121
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:55,920
is was uh from a side again a cyber

122
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,519
security perspective a successful

123
00:03:57,519 --> 00:03:58,319
defense

124
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:01,680
of the 2016. election

125
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:04,239
now given that targeting given that

126
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:05,120
broad

127
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,640
understanding of what the russians

128
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:09,040
attempted they put a playbook out there

129
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,319
the chinese were able to see it the

130
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:12,319
iranians the north koreans

131
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:14,720
cyber criminals everybody understood

132
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,478
that this was a target set that would

133
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:17,040
generate

134
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:20,000
a lot of activity and that takes me to i

135
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,720
think my final point on 2016

136
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,680
election security issues the

137
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:25,840
implications

138
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:29,199
of what transpired in 2016. i've talked

139
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:30,400
about it before and think

140
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,560
i actually talked about it last year out

141
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,160
in vegas

142
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,880
that was almost a sputnik moment take

143
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:39,759
yourself back to 1957 or put yourself in

144
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:42,000
the shoes of someone in 1957.

145
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,280
when the soviets put sputnik into low

146
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,960
earth orbit

147
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,639
why was that such a significant

148
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:50,479
undertaking yeah they got there before

149
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:51,040
us

150
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,040
but there was another element how did

151
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,639
sputnik get up there

152
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:56,000
it was effectively attached to an

153
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,160
intercontinental ballistic missile

154
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,680
for the first time the soviets had the

155
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:03,440
capability to reach out and touch us

156
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:06,240
the oceans to our west and our east and

157
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,520
across the top

158
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,280
no longer gave us that geographic

159
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,720
isolation

160
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,919
that we had worked for that was pretty

161
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:15,759
that had protected us for years and

162
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:17,680
years they had the ability

163
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:21,120
to disrupt in 2000 in 1957.

164
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:24,800
now in 2016 using cyber techniques

165
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:27,120
they were once again able to reach out

166
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,880
and touch us and give us

167
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:31,919
that uncertainty they could use cyber

168
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:33,280
techniques

169
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:35,600
to destabilize and ultimately

170
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,600
potentially undermine democracy prior to

171
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,639
that point

172
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:40,800
cyber security incidents were

173
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,720
intellectual property theft

174
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:46,320
a bad movie financial crimes

175
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,720
but this was something much much more

176
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:51,680
something much much more visceral

177
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:54,880
so we knew that we had a lot of on

178
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:57,840
at stake for 2018 that we had a lot at

179
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,440
stake for 2020.

180
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:02,080
so that brings me forward to today where

181
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:02,880
are we today

182
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:06,000
i think there it's a night and day

183
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,440
comparison we have three distinct

184
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,880
advantages today

185
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:14,000
than what existed in 2016. first

186
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,160
there is a vibrant election security

187
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,520
community

188
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,600
second we have a better understanding of

189
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:22,000
risk and enhanced risk mitigation

190
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,360
techniques across

191
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,919
election infrastructure again night and

192
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:28,960
day between what existed in 2016.

193
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:32,080
and finally we have better visibility

194
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,680
across the systems that support the

195
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,440
administration of elections

196
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,520
i think it's important to keep in mind

197
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:38,560
that my team

198
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,240
that the rest of the federal government

199
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:42,240
from an election security perspective

200
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,880
is here in support of state and local

201
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,160
election officials

202
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:48,400
under the constitution article 1 section

203
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,240
4 they're responsible for the

204
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,800
time place and manner of elections we

205
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,639
are there to support them

206
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:58,400
so what did we do 2017 and on

207
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:01,680
we helped foster this vibrant election

208
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:02,800
security community

209
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,800
one of the first things that we did was

210
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,319
pull together an information sharing and

211
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:07,599
analysis center

212
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:11,039
today all 50 states and close to 7

213
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:14,080
000 jurisdictions across this country

214
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,919
get some kind of benefit whether it's

215
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:17,360
threat information

216
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:20,800
best practices strategic information

217
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,840
on election security issues it's the

218
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,919
fastest growing isac

219
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:27,919
in the history of ice acts that's a good

220
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:29,039
thing

221
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:32,400
we also have been providing services

222
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:35,039
technical capabilities out there to our

223
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:35,680
partners

224
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,680
and how do we do that well we've also

225
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,599
pulled together mechanisms like our

226
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:41,199
sector coordinating council

227
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:42,840
that pulls together all levels of

228
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:45,280
government federal state local tribal

229
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:46,400
territorial

230
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,319
private sector security researchers

231
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:49,840
bring everyone together

232
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:52,400
to analyze issues analyze trends pull

233
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,080
together best practices

234
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,879
as the congress appropriates money for

235
00:07:56,879 --> 00:07:57,599
election

236
00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:00,000
security grants we've been able to

237
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:00,800
develop

238
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:04,560
investment guidance on how they can best

239
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:07,680
buy down risk and it's not just sitting

240
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:08,560
there

241
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:11,840
taking a guess we use the techniques the

242
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:12,639
tools

243
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:14,240
the services that we've provided over

244
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,759
the last couple years

245
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:18,400
to inform that guidance we've conducted

246
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,360
risk

247
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:22,160
risk assessments penetration testing we

248
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:22,960
understand

249
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,879
generally across the board what the

250
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:26,560
shortcomings and challenges are

251
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:27,919
and we've tailored that guidance

252
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:31,919
specifically to those officials

253
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:35,039
this risk understanding is also better

254
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:36,559
as i mentioned

255
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:39,679
so 2016 we didn't know

256
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:42,080
how these elections were run we didn't

257
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:42,880
understand

258
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,399
the different techniques the different

259
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:46,320
mechanisms different processes

260
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,839
uh the different systems that were in

261
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:49,519
place across the states

262
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:52,320
we've invested significant resources not

263
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:52,800
just

264
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:55,040
analyzing these but working with our

265
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,040
partners to understand the systems they

266
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:57,600
use

267
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,399
they told us what their issues were so

268
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:01,279
based on this

269
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:03,440
risk guidance we've been able to invest

270
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,200
in capabilities and risk management

271
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,160
techniques

272
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,920
one of the best risk management

273
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,440
techniques right now

274
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:13,360
paper we have from day one

275
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:16,080
encouraged states to shift to some

276
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,279
system that has

277
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:19,360
a paper record associated with every

278
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,120
vote that's important

279
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:24,399
in 2016 80 percent of votes cast had a

280
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:27,440
paper record associated with the vote

281
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:31,760
for 2020 we're on track for 92 percent

282
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,120
and actually we might even do a little

283
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,720
bit better and i'll come back to that in

284
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,320
just a minute

285
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,640
why is it so important to have a paper

286
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,160
ballot associated with

287
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:43,120
the vote auditability everyone in this

288
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:43,680
crowd

289
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,200
should understand the importance of

290
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,920
auditability the ability to effectively

291
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,920
go back and check the logs you have the

292
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:50,560
receipt

293
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:54,000
you can understand what transpired

294
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,560
if you see something that's suspicious

295
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,560
or otherwise anomalous

296
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,160
we need to go back and check the records

297
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:03,680
that's what the paper ballot gives us

298
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:06,480
so with that understanding of risk with

299
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,399
those techniques that we've

300
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:11,120
instituted the last bit is we have

301
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,800
better visibility

302
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:15,120
across the election sector frankly than

303
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,360
likely any other sector

304
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:20,240
in the critical infrastructure space how

305
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,040
did we do that

306
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:24,320
well starting back in 2016 we

307
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,480
und we worked to understand what the

308
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,959
challenges were that election officials

309
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:31,040
faced i've talked about that what we

310
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,959
didn't have was trust

311
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:36,640
we have worked significantly

312
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,399
significantly across the last couple

313
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:40,720
years to develop a trusted relationship

314
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,160
with our state and local election

315
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:44,000
officials

316
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,760
that has allowed us to partner with them

317
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:48,240
to give them tools and capabilities

318
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:51,519
including intrusion detection systems

319
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:52,880
that they could then deploy across their

320
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,959
networks at this point

321
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:57,360
in the run-up to the 2020 election we

322
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,399
have ids

323
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:01,120
our ids system the albert monitors

324
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:01,600
across

325
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:04,399
all 50 states in some states we have

326
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:06,160
total coverage of every county florida

327
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,240
for example 67 counties

328
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:11,120
all have albert sensors deployed where

329
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,959
we can load them up

330
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:15,600
with the signatures they can alert on

331
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:18,079
activity we can investigate

332
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:20,399
and we can ensure the security of the

333
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:22,079
2020 election

334
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:25,440
that visibility again gives us the

335
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,640
confidence

336
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:29,680
that 2020 will be the most protected

337
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:33,519
most secure election in modern history

338
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:35,839
so when we think about what's next we

339
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:36,720
have to look forward

340
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:39,839
to november 2020. we've done a lot we've

341
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:41,120
invested a lot

342
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:43,279
we have capabilities but there's more to

343
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:44,560
do

344
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:48,079
for one we have to continue preparing

345
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:50,880
for a capable disruptive actor we also

346
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,480
have to recognize that changes in the

347
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,240
air literally covet

348
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,760
changing the way that elections happen

349
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,440
across this country

350
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:00,720
lastly you come into play here we have

351
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,240
to have an informed

352
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:04,880
patient voter so let's take it back to

353
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,560
the top

354
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:09,680
capable disruptive adversaries at this

355
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:10,000
point

356
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,200
in 2016 we had done a number of incident

357
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,560
responses

358
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:17,120
we had intelligence that gave us a good

359
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,800
understanding of what the adversary was

360
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,639
doing

361
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:24,320
today in 2020 based on our visibility

362
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:26,160
based on the intelligence the focused

363
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,079
mission of the intelligence community

364
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:31,360
the nsa cybercom's efforts

365
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,760
we are still looking around to see if in

366
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,040
particular the russians but also the

367
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,880
chinese the iranians and north koreans

368
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,720
or others are targeting our

369
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:41,519
infrastructure based on that visibility

370
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:43,360
we see activity on a daily basis we

371
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,519
can't attribute it directly to any

372
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:48,160
state adversary or state actor but

373
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:49,839
there's a whole lot of scanning going on

374
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:53,360
absolutely but again nothing at

375
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:57,200
the directed focused effort of 2016.

376
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,519
now i don't know about you i'm a little

377
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:00,480
paranoid

378
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,639
so i'm not resting on my laurels i'm

379
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:04,079
looking at what else is happening out

380
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:04,800
there

381
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:07,200
i see ransomware attacks happening on a

382
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,800
regular basis

383
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,959
not just at state and local governments

384
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:12,720
schools hospitals

385
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,399
and also financial institutions and

386
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:15,760
elsewhere

387
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,360
so when i look at the remaining time

388
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,040
between now and november

389
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:21,760
i'm thinking about that ransomware actor

390
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,519
i'm thinking about what we need to do

391
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:26,560
to protect those at-risk systems when

392
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:29,040
they would be at their highest level of

393
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:29,920
risk

394
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,360
and what we can do in the meantime

395
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,440
that's why last year we launched a voter

396
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:34,000
registration

397
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,480
database ransomware initiative to work

398
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:37,680
with our partners

399
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:40,079
in state local and the private sector to

400
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:41,440
secure those systems

401
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,279
better configuration multi-factor

402
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:44,800
authentication

403
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:47,519
doing the basics right but there's a

404
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:48,639
second piece of this

405
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:50,880
it's not always about the systems it's

406
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,959
not always about the people

407
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:55,760
sometimes it's about the processes so

408
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:56,720
what we're doing

409
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,480
is in addition to protecting those

410
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,639
systems and giving state locals the

411
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:01,839
support they need

412
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:04,079
to harden their infrastructure we're

413
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:05,920
also looking at the failover mechanisms

414
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:08,560
what are those resilience measures

415
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:11,040
what everybody in this room knows is a

416
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,959
good backup

417
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:16,000
can't be beaten so analog

418
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,160
backups at the state level at the county

419
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:20,800
level at the individual precinct levels

420
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:23,600
so if something goes wrong it might hit

421
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,120
a voter registration database

422
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:27,519
or a poll book for that matter you can

423
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:29,600
flip to that stack of paper

424
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:32,800
to ensure that the voters can vote

425
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,959
whether it's in early voting or actually

426
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:36,000
on election day

427
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,560
that the voters can vote and if anything

428
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:39,680
else goes wrong you've also got

429
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41,440
provisional ballots so again

430
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,120
we're encouraging not just the hardening

431
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,639
of the systems

432
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:46,480
but those resilience measures those

433
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,160
analog measures

434
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:50,399
that will increase the resilience of the

435
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:52,560
process the administration

436
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:57,040
of elections writ large

437
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:00,560
now we talked about those ids those

438
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,560
albert sensors that are out there

439
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:05,040
we can't stop there either this summer

440
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:07,760
we're rolling out a pilot program across

441
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:10,880
the country to introduce endpoint

442
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,800
detection response capabilities

443
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:15,120
in a number of jurisdictions we got to

444
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,720
push it out to the edge

445
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:19,600
get capabilities on individual hosts

446
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:20,959
whether it's forensics

447
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:23,839
incident response we have to continue

448
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:24,399
raising

449
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:26,399
the level of security across our

450
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:27,600
election

451
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,519
community again this goes to that

452
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:31,120
vibrant election security community i

453
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,160
talked that talked about at the

454
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:34,560
beginning

455
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:38,079
now in terms of kovid well that's why

456
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:38,959
we're doing this

457
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:40,959
that's why i'm here in springfield

458
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:42,639
virginia coming to you

459
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:45,759
across the internet covett is changing

460
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:46,880
the way elections

461
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:49,600
happen there's no question about that

462
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,279
that became very clear

463
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:54,480
in february when we were all out in san

464
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,639
francisco for another conference

465
00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:58,800
we knew that kovit was changing the

466
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,320
complexion of elections

467
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:01,920
it was going to change how vote the

468
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:04,639
voting process would happen in person

469
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:07,759
social distancing masking ppe

470
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:10,940
disinfecting throwing away pins

471
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:12,560
[Music]

472
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,399
we knew that that was going to change

473
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:15,759
the way elections would happen so we

474
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:17,440
immediately partnered with cdc

475
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:19,839
and hhs again through those coordination

476
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:22,560
mechanisms that we developed years ago

477
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,160
to pull everybody together develop

478
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:26,079
guidance develop plans

479
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:27,279
so over the last several months we've

480
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:30,000
issued a significant amount of guidance

481
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,320
through our coordinating councils but

482
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:35,519
it's not just about the in-person voting

483
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:38,399
many states have adopted changes in the

484
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:39,600
way

485
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,839
vote the vote will take place that

486
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:42,720
includes

487
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:45,600
adopting absentee and mail-in balloting

488
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,920
so we talked about that 80 percent to 92

489
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:48,880
percent

490
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:51,440
shift well you might say hey 92 percent

491
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,959
not good enough how do we get to a

492
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:53,680
hundred

493
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:55,680
well adopting some of these new

494
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:57,120
technologies

495
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:01,199
takes time it takes training takes money

496
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:03,759
one state in particular new jersey had

497
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:05,679
not been able to identify the money

498
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:07,679
to replace their systems they have those

499
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:10,319
direct recording equipment machines

500
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:12,400
that don't have a paper ballot

501
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,599
associated with the vote

502
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:15,679
so they'd spent resources we've been

503
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:18,079
supporting securing those systems

504
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:20,720
in the back end in other ways but again

505
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:21,280
these

506
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:25,199
machines still work now because of covid

507
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:27,359
they've decided to adopt to a more

508
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:30,480
mail-in or absentee ballot approach

509
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:33,919
so we may see that 92 percent

510
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:35,600
of paper ballots associated with the

511
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:38,080
2020 vote actually increase

512
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:42,080
again auditability that enables us to

513
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:42,480
roll

514
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,240
back the tape and determine what

515
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:46,400
happened and conduct meaningful

516
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:49,520
post-election audits

517
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,840
so we will continue working over the

518
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:52,799
next several months

519
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:55,919
as the coveted pandemic evolves to

520
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:57,360
introduce guidance

521
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:59,039
to ensure that you as the voter have

522
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:00,960
information and that's the

523
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,559
i think the last important thing to talk

524
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:04,240
about here

525
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:06,640
the last measure of resilience in the

526
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:07,919
2020 election

527
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:12,000
is going to be an informed patient voter

528
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,240
it's going to take time to count the

529
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:15,120
vote

530
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:18,160
whether it's absentee ballots coming in

531
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:21,280
whether it's longer lines

532
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:23,919
whatever it takes it's going to take a

533
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:24,720
little bit

534
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:28,160
more time so on november 3rd it's quite

535
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:29,280
possible

536
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:32,240
that we won't know who won the election

537
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:33,919
so that's why we need you

538
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:36,160
we need everyone to be a more patient

539
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,600
voter

540
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:40,799
to wait until the vote is certified

541
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:43,039
and we know who the winner is again it

542
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:44,799
takes a little bit more time this go

543
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:46,240
around because of kovid

544
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:49,440
but that's okay so in the meantime

545
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:52,880
we need informed voters too i assume

546
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:55,280
that just about every voter out there

547
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:56,480
particularly everyone that's watching

548
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:57,919
this watching this that's going to vote

549
00:18:57,919 --> 00:18:59,600
here in the u.s

550
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,120
something's going to change about the

551
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:03,600
way you vote something will have changed

552
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:06,080
from 2018 or 2016.

553
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:08,080
whether it's a new polling location i

554
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,000
know i tend to vote in a school

555
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,320
schools may not be available some people

556
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:14,400
vote in long-term care facilities

557
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,960
those will not likely be available

558
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:18,799
public institutions

559
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:22,160
uh fire departments again might not be

560
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:22,880
available

561
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:26,080
so it's up to you to identify

562
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:28,960
how you're going to vote have a plan

563
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,320
we've been talking about having voting

564
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:32,640
plans for years now

565
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,400
it's that much more important right now

566
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,320
understand how your voting process has

567
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:37,440
changed

568
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:38,960
you may want to take advantage of early

569
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:41,280
voting if your state allows for

570
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:42,720
other kinds of voting like absentee or

571
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,400
mail you need to research that you need

572
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,640
to make sure you get your information in

573
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:49,200
and your vote in by the deadline but

574
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,799
most importantly

575
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:52,799
have a little bit of patience this one's

576
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:53,919
going to be worth it

577
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:56,880
so with that please be a part of the

578
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,960
