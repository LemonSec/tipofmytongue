platform for it

security and operations

11
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:22,640

84
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:04,560
today

85
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,000

86
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,760
scope and also encourage people

00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:08,879
from no matter where you are in the

88
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:11,599
world you can participate in security

89
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:14,480
it's really a community of ideas

90
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:17,680
okay here we go afghanistan american

91
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:18,720

i think for the second year in a row

101
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,799
zimbabwe hopefully he brings a friend

102
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:50,159
next year and we can get him off this

103
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:51,920
list

104
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,599
okay another thing that we do every year

105
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:55,040
is we offer scholarships

106
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,799
we're trying to figure out a way to

107
00:03:56,799 --> 00:03:58,799
bring those not so lucky

108
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:00,879
uh to have a high-paying job in

109
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:02,000
information security

110
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,239
to develop the skills to find an on-ramp

111
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:05,760
to get involved in the

112
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,720
professional side of things what are

113
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:09,599
their on-ramps

114
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:11,760
so black cat we have scholarships and we

115
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:14,319
give these away for a number of reasons

116
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:16,880
some are for writing white papers that

117
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,079
get reviewed well

118
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:21,440
and so we give passes for free this year

119
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,639
we've distributed

120
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:24,560
the scholarships to a number of

121
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,479
different organizations

122
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:29,440
so blacks and cyber 25 scholarships

123
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:30,240
awarded

124
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:34,479
the covid 19 relief scholarship 71

125
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:36,880

or the ewf 50 scholarships

128
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:44,720
student scholarships 85

129
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,800
veteran scholarships a new thing that

130
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:47,919
was started last year

131
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:50,639
we have 30 and finally women in security

132
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:52,720
and privacy or wisp

133
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:56,000
40 for a total of 301 scholarships for

134
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,840
this year's conference

135
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,520
that's fantastic it's something i'm

136
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:00,720
really proud of and i'm really glad

137
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:01,440
black hat

138
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,840
continues every year to grow this

139
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,600
program and bring new blood

140
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,000
new ideas more diversity into our

141
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,039
community because it's

142
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:13,680
really needed so

143
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:16,240
how many of you last year thought that

144
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,440
this year you'd be living in your

145
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:18,960
cyberpunk future

146
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:22,320
i think in the last year i've realized

147
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,000
more of what i grew up reading in the

148
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,600
90s with

149
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,880
maybe neuromancer or william gibson and

150
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,400
shockwave rider and some of the other

151
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,919
classics

152
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:35,440
it seems to be all happening right now

153
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,120
and the part that for me is the most

154
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:39,039
vivid is sort of the

155
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:41,919
very rapid erosion of privacy uh civil

156
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:42,880
liberties

157
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,320
the very rapid expansion of

158
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,560
authoritarianism online

159
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:49,039
um the quick speed with which companies

160
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:50,560
are sort of doing battle

161
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,720
with national governments whether it's

162
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:53,840
over taxes or

163
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:57,360
a fragmented internet or routing or

164
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:00,400
maybe liability so

165
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,000
just like everything else the pandemic

166
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,720
is accelerated by cyberpunk future

167
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,639
and i bring that up because i want to

168
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:08,960
remind everybody that we're part of that

169
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,319
even if we're just a little part on the

170
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:12,319
side the things we build the

171
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:14,000
technologies we create

172
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,680
are going to be part of that and it's

173
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:18,639
going to be left to future governments

174
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:21,280
future generations i mean we're still

175
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:21,919
living with

176
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:26,080
ftp and that's what 35 40 years old

177
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:29,360
we haven't moved to ipv6 yet or dns sec

178
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:32,400
and those are measured in decades of age

179
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,560
so really yes what we do build today is

180
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,759
probably going to be around

181
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:38,880
for decades so keep that in mind uh when

182
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,080
we're making decisions

183
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,560
that there is a trade-off between uh

184
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,160
privacy and security

185
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,400
and the implications are not theoretical

186
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,160
they're becoming more and more

187
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:51,280
real world looking at facial recognition

188
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,440
is the most recent battle

189
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:56,800
for private privacy and civil liberties

190
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,639
and this leads me to sort of a second

191
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:01,680
thought which is

192
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,120
it was kind of cuckoo to say a couple

193
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,199
years ago there's sort of

194
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:07,759
the east and the west or there's the the

195
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:08,560
open internet

196
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:11,120
and there's the vulcanized or fragmented

197
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,160
internet

198
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,960
and now not so crazy um you can really

199
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:17,759
see battle lines being drawn between

200
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:20,000
countries with sort of western rule of

201
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,599
law values

202
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:23,759
and those with more of an authoritarian

203
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:26,000
or the party

204
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,680
control centralization china

205
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:32,560
or maybe north korea russia some others

206
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,759
and i think what's happening now is

207
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:35,520
you're seeing a fast realignment

208
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:39,280
in technology supply chain social media

209
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:41,120
the data that gets collected on you and

210
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,960
how it gets shared with the government

211
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:46,319
is happening so quickly and it's

212
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:47,840
happening in such a way now that you

213
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,360
might not be aware of it for example

214
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,520
a chinese company might own a large

215
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,599
shake stake in an american company and

216
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:55,280
they might get access to some data that

217
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:57,039
might end up going back to china

218
00:07:57,039 --> 00:07:58,720
that you're not aware of and it might

219
00:07:58,720 --> 00:07:59,680
not have been anything that was

220
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:00,479
contemplated

221
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:02,400
when that partnership was originally

222
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,599
created

223
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:04,720
so i think what we're going to see in

224
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,800
the years to come is we're going to

225
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:07,680
probably see

226
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:11,520
some sort of u.s policy toward

227
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:14,160
industry industrial and technology

228
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:14,960
transfers

229
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:17,440
or an industrial policy in the united

230
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,639
states

231
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:20,000
is one of the few countries in the world

232
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,960
without an industrial policy

233
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:26,560
and now we have a white house strategy

234
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:27,680
on 5g

235
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:28,960
we have some battles going on with

236
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:31,039
huawei

237
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:32,958
i think in the next five years we'll

238
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:35,039
have an industrial policy

239
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:36,880
and then we'll be just like everybody

240
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:39,039
else in the world and while that battle

241
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:40,479
is happening and those lobbyists are

242
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:43,440
fighting um i want you to keep in mind

243
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:43,839
that

244
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:45,839
privacy and human rights and civil

245
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:47,279
liberties need to be

246
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:49,360
considered in all of these decisions

247
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,720
because really

248
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:53,040
it will be i believe two types of

249
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:55,360
networks those that respect rule of law

250
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:58,959
and those that don't so

251
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:01,200
the big battle space for this year 2020

252
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,080
the

253
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,680
national election for new president

254
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,360
united states

255
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,760
lots of interference lots of

256
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:08,640
misinformation

257
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:11,360
lots of new technologies being deployed

258
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,720
and that's why

259
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,800
we're going to have our keynote matt

260
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,399
blaze

261
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:19,440
now it's my honor to talk a little bit

262
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,880
about matt i've followed matt's career

263
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,240
for a long long time

264
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,680
i think one of the things i was most

265
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,839
proud of was when he was involved

266
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:27,120
in cracking encrypted radio

267
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,440
communications used by police

268
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,200
to point out that there are problems

269
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,519
with this technology

270
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:36,560
he's been heavily contributory to

271
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:39,360
the public knowledge space always been

272
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:42,000
in public education

273
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,399
worried about and helping the community

274
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:45,680
he's the chairman of the

275
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:49,360
tor project he's the

276
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:52,640
co-creator four years ago uh with myself

277
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:55,120
on the voting machine village hacking

278
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,240
village at defcon

279
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,800
which has had tremendous impact and

280
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,480
managed to convince several states to

281
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,000
change the kind of technology they buy

282
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,160
in their voting machines

283
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:06,160
he has repeatedly provided expert

284
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,560
testimony to the us congress

285
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:12,160
and he's an election

286
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:16,160
security expert and he's currently

287
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:19,519
at the mcdermott i'm sorry the mcdevitt

288
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:20,240
chair

289
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,440
and computer science and law at

290
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,360
georgetown university in

291
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:26,640
washington dc with a focus on privacy

292
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:29,440
cryptography and security at scale

293
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:32,160
and obviously this year his uh time is

294
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,760
all taken up focused on election

295
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:34,720
security

296
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:37,839
so we're going to be uh

297
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:40,720
listening to matt talk about election

298
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:41,760
integrity

299
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:44,800
during a national pandemic

300
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:47,839
thank you very much for making the time

301
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:48,480
for this

302
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,640
virtual black hat and i really look

303
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:51,600
forward to seeing you

304
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:54,320
next year in person yep now i'd like to

305
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,920
introduce philippe corteau

306
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:58,720
ceo of koalas and the platinum sponsor

307
00:10:58,720 --> 00:10:59,040
for

308
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:01,519
black cat briefings this year now for

309
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:03,120
those of you who don't know felipe

310
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,360
in qualis they're a long time sponsor of

311
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,440
black hat big believers in our mission

312
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:11,200
in almost 20 years being a top sponsor

313
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:14,800
so felipe in 2004

314
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:17,360
received the sc magazine editors award

315
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,440
for bringing on-demand technology to the

316
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,399
network

317
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:22,800
in the security space that that sounds

318
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,320
kind of strange right on-demand

319
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,360
technology

320
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,880
but you have to remember this is as

321
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:29,920
pre-cloud and pre-sas

322
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:31,680
and as qualis was developed it was

323
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,279
really became a sas

324
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:36,079
security company for developing and

325
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:37,120
delivering

326
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:41,519
security in years later he developed

327
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:43,279
and co-founded the cso interchange to

328
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:44,640
provide a forum

329
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,240
for sharing information in the security

330
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,320
space and then was named

331
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:51,440
2011 ceo of the year by sc magazine

332
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:53,279
awards in europe

333
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:55,680
and you see this progression of sort of

334
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:56,480
pre-sas

335
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:59,839
sas cloud and

336
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:03,120
qualis adapting at each stage so

337
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,959
with that there's a certain amount of

338
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:06,480
forward-looking vision

339
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,240
felipe brings and because of that i'm

340
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:09,680
looking forward to his comments to

341
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:10,000
everyone

342
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,360
this morning thank you thank jeff

343
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:16,160
for such a nice introduction and for

344
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:17,200
keeping the spirit

345
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,760
of black cat alive in such difficult

346
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:20,720
times

347
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,560
where we are certainly missing the

348
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:23,839
essential human

349
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:27,040
interaction welcome to you all

350
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:30,000
and first let me encourage you to engage

351
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:30,959
with the black

352
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:34,079
hat online platform and to visit

353
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:36,959
the business old it is now a real

354
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:38,560
pleasure for me to

355
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:41,440
introduce our keynote speaker who really

356
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:42,079
doesn't

357
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:45,360
need much introduction

358
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,839
he's currently the mac david chair of

359
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:49,200
computer science and law

360
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,920
at georgetown university on the board of

361
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:52,800
tour that

362
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:55,839
all of you know and a cryptographic

363
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:57,440
extraordinaire

364
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,760
today is going to share with us the

365
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:00,959
technological

366
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:04,079
economical and political challenges

367
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:06,079
of living through such a crippling

368
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:07,360
pandemic

369
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:11,680
and now ladies and gentlemen matt blais

370
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:15,120
hi and uh my name is matt blais and

371
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:17,200
first of all thanks so much for inviting

372
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,160
me

373
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:21,360
to give this keynote uh this morning i'm

374
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:22,160
going to talk

375
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:25,200
about uh election security

376
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,680
and this is a very different talk than i

377
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:28,320
would have

378
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:31,519
given uh four or five months ago

379
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:34,399
um but we'll be talking a little bit

380
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:35,440
about

381
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:39,040
um stress testing our democracy

382
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:42,240
and how we think about election security

383
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:45,279
with the added wrinkle of

384
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:48,639
an emergency and a pandemic so

385
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:51,680
technology and elections

386
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:54,959
in the united states are very

387
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:58,160
heavily interrelated

388
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:01,440
and that wasn't always the case in fact

389
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:04,720
early elections in the u.s used very

390
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,399
little technology at all

391
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:09,920
they consisted pretty much of getting

392
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:14,079
people together in a room and

393
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:17,519
having them raise their hands um this

394
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:20,720
stopped being viable because it really

395
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,000
doesn't scale

396
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,360
very well and it was only

397
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:28,480
because fitting everyone in a community

398
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:30,079
in town into the town hall

399
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:34,079
on election day stopped being practical

400
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:37,199
that we started to adopt technological

401
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:38,399
mechanisms

402
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:40,639
for elections fairly early in the

403
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:42,959
history of the united states

404
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:46,800
and the earliest technology that we used

405
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:49,839
here and that most democracies uh used

406
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:50,959
at the time

407
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:54,240
was a simple paper ballots put into a

408
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:55,920
ballot box

409
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:58,399
and uh then counted at the end of the

410
00:14:58,399 --> 00:14:59,600
day

411
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:02,000
and you know we don't think of that as

412
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,639
being particularly technological

413
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:06,000
but it actually has some very

414
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,480
interesting security properties

415
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:11,839
if you take a piece of paper and nobody

416
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:13,199
looks at it

417
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:16,959
and you put it into a ballot box

418
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:19,199
and then shake the ballot box up at the

419
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:20,079
end of the day

420
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:21,760
and make sure that you've looked in the

421
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,440
ballot box at the beginning

422
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,120
of the day and make sure it was empty

423
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:27,279
and full at the end of the day

424
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:29,519
this very nice property that as long as

425
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:31,120
the ballot box itself

426
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:34,800
isn't tampered with you have pretty high

427
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:35,680
confidence

428
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:38,480
that the vote you put in gets to be one

429
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:39,519
of the votes

430
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:42,079
that's counted and you can watch that

431
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:43,680
process pretty well

432
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:46,639
it also adds along with it a new

433
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:47,600
property

434
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,519
that you didn't get in the room with

435
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:51,519
everyone raising their hands

436
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:55,120
which is a ballot secrecy no one can

437
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,720
tell how you voted

438
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:00,000
but you're confident that your vote got

439
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:00,639
counted

440
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:03,279
uh as you cast it as long as that ballot

441
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:04,160
box

442
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:05,600
didn't get tampered with and the

443
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,360
counting process uh

444
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:10,880
had high integrity so that was a pretty

445
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:14,160
interesting and high standard

446
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:17,120
for security that other subsequent

447
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,480
technologies

448
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:23,120
had to meet and we've moved on largely

449
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:27,440
from the literal ballots in a box that

450
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:30,240
we count by hand in most of the us

451
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:33,600
uh to other more advanced

452
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:36,480
technologies like machine counted

453
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:37,920
ballots

454
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:41,759
where we might cast our vote on

455
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:43,519
something that can be tabulated by

456
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:45,600
machine rather than people

457
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:49,600
or that actually records our votes

458
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:52,560
directly on technology like those older

459
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,320
lever voting machines

460
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:57,519
which record internally how you voted uh

461
00:16:57,519 --> 00:16:58,240
and then

462
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:01,600
finally um we have voting computers in

463
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,040
which we cast our votes

464
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:06,079
in some way with the aid of a computer

465
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:08,000
but what all of these have in common and

466
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,599
their security properties and their

467
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:11,520
risks are a little bit different

468
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:14,640
is that our confidence in the outcome of

469
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,240
the election

470
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:20,400
increasingly depends on our confidence

471
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:23,119
in the integrity of the mechanisms that

472
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:24,799
we're using to do this

473
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:28,240
so it's very important that we trust

474
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:31,840
not only the people who are involved in

475
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:35,360
elections but also the technology that

476
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:37,360
we depend on

477
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:40,640
for those elections to be secure to have

478
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:42,400
high integrity and to be

479
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:45,520
genuinely reflective of

480
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:48,799
how we voted now this is

481
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:51,120
and i i've i've often said this long

482
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,320
before the pandemic

483
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:55,280
i've been working on election security

484
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:55,679
for

485
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:57,840
a couple of decades now and i'm a

486
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,640
computer scientist who studies

487
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:03,600
computer security which is full of

488
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,760
terribly hard problems

489
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:08,000
i don't think i've ever encountered a

490
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,200
problem

491
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:12,080
that's harder than the security and

492
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:13,600
integrity of

493
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:17,200
civil elections it's fundamentally

494
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:20,080
orders of magnitude more difficult and

495
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:22,240
more complex

496
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:25,919
than than almost anything else

497
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:28,640
you can imagine or that we that we do

498
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,400
and one of the reasons for this

499
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:33,600
is that some of the requirements for

500
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:34,799
elections

501
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:37,919
contradict each other um so

502
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:40,400
for from a technology point of view the

503
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:41,120
biggest

504
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:44,080
contradiction is that we have two

505
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:45,760
requirements

506
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:49,600
that um conflict with each other in a

507
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,360
way that improving one

508
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:53,840
degrades the other so those two

509
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:55,520
requirements are

510
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:58,799
secrecy we want to not be able to

511
00:18:58,799 --> 00:18:59,600
discover

512
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:02,799
how someone else voted or even be able

513
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:03,520
to prove

514
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:06,000
how we voted to another person under

515
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,440
duress

516
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:10,640
but we also want transparency

517
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:13,360
we want to be confident that our vote

518
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,880
was counted as cast

519
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:17,440
and that the whole system is doing that

520
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:19,280
for everyone else

521
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:21,679
so we have one requirement that says you

522
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:23,360
can't find anything out about how

523
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:24,559
someone voted

524
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:26,240
and another requirement that says you

525
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:27,760
want to be able to audit everything and

526
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:29,039
be sure

527
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:31,760
that uh everyone's vote was counted as

528
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:33,039
they intended

529
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:35,600
and that when when you think about ways

530
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:38,000
of actually accomplishing that

531
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,039
the ballot box with pieces of paper

532
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:43,840
seems to do it pretty well and almost

533
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:45,760
nothing else

534
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:49,440
comes close unless you

535
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:52,400
start to have to get very clever but

536
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,000
that's not the only

537
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,720
difficulty of elections the other

538
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,080
difficulty is

539
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:02,080
the starkness of

540
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:05,440
the application itself and in particular

541
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:08,320
there is it is almost impossible if you

542
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:09,440
discover

543
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:13,600
an irregularity to redo an election

544
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,039
elections pretty much have to be

545
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:17,039
certified by a certain date

546
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:20,080
and even if you discover that there were

547
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:23,960
widespread irregularities the

548
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:27,200
consequences of doing an election

549
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:30,799
over and the difficulty of

550
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:34,159
logistically pulling off doing a

551
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:38,000
statewide or national election again

552
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,720
before the date that whoever is being

553
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:41,360
elected

554
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:44,480
assumes office make it

555
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,799
pretty much impossible all right so

556
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:48,799
let's i'm going to talk a little bit

557
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:51,440
about how voting works uh in the united

558
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:52,000
states

559
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,720
from a legal and structural uh point of

560
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:55,360
view

561
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:57,919
we think about presidential elections

562
00:20:57,919 --> 00:20:58,640
you know that

563
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:00,159
for a federal office that's what

564
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:01,840
everyone thinks of that's what we're

565
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:03,520
thinking about largely

566
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:06,400
for november that's certainly the the

567
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:07,520
election

568
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:12,159
that we pay the most attention to

569
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:15,120
but in fact the federal government has

570
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:16,159
remarkably

571
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:19,520
little to do in practice with

572
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:22,880
the process and the mechanisms of voting

573
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,640
the federal government sets pretty broad

574
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:27,280
standards mostly in the constitution

575
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:29,360
congress has authority but it's very

576
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:30,640
reluctant to

577
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:33,840
exercise it in practice each

578
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:37,280
state sets its own rules has its own

579
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:40,080
laws has its own requirements

580
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:42,480
for the elections that are conducted in

581
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:43,600
that state

582
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:46,799
and in most states elections

583
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:49,760
are actually run by local governments

584
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:51,520
most often counties

585
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:54,320
and to give you a sense of the scale

586
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:55,120
there

587
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:58,000
there are over 3 000 counties in the

588
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,159
united states and if you add

589
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:03,600
the townships and other governments

590
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:06,400
that that run elections there are over 5

591
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:07,760
000

592
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:11,440
government entities responsible for

593
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:15,039
doing everything with uh the elections

594
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:18,799
for their residents so there's no single

595
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:19,919
place

596
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:24,880
that uh can change everything nationwide

597
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:28,240
and uh furthermore

598
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:30,960
when we vote in person uh we generally

599
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:31,360
vote

600
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:33,679
in our neighborhood in in polling places

601
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:35,520
that are called precincts

602
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:38,320
and each county each government might

603
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:38,720
have

604
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:42,400
hundreds or even thousands of precincts

605
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,039
within it

606
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:46,559
so this is a a pretty large scale

607
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:50,640
and very decentralized operation

608
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:54,080
u.s elections are also the most complex

609
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:56,240
in the world in terms of the number of

610
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:57,679
different races

611
00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:00,000
and the number of different types of

612
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,280
ballots

613
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:03,440
that people even within the same county

614
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:04,320
may see

615
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:06,320
so you know everybody votes for

616
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:07,440
president

617
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:09,679
um everybody in a state votes for their

618
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:11,360
state senators

619
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:13,840
but we also will have very local

620
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:14,799
elections like

621
00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:17,840
school districts and and so on and so

622
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:19,360
even within a precinct there may be

623
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:19,840
several

624
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:23,280
different ballots that different voters

625
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:24,320
end up

626
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:26,960
getting and that all has to be managed

627
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:27,679
by

628
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:31,679
a local government that's mostly

629
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:34,480
stretched pretty thin in general it's

630
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:36,320
the county budget that's paying for

631
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:37,039
elections

632
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:40,159
so when we talk about voting systems and

633
00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:41,120
we talk about

634
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:43,840
uh election management we're competing

635
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:44,559
with

636
00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:47,840
uh with things like road

637
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:50,159
repair and you know fire department

638
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:51,279
services

639
00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:54,720
for resources and for budgets

640
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:56,640
to give you a sense of the the scale of

641
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,559
this uh in 2016

642
00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:02,320
in the general election there were

643
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:06,320
almost 117 000 different polling places

644
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:07,919
in the united states

645
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:12,320
and 178 000 and chains

646
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:15,440
uh different ballots uh that

647
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:18,720
americans might vote on

648
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:21,919
there was a huge temporary workforce of

649
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:24,640
between about four and about 10 people

650
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:25,840
depending on the

651
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:28,799
local circumstances per polling place

652
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:31,760
mostly hired to work just on that day

653
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:35,039
and trained for

654
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:37,600
uh you know a day or two on election

655
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:38,480
procedures

656
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:40,320
and they're probably your neighbors when

657
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:42,080
you vote in person

658
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:44,840
um there were in 2016 throughout the

659
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:46,600
country

660
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:50,159
138 uh 0.8 million

661
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:53,120
ballots cast and that was about 60

662
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:53,840
percent

663
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:57,120
of the eligible voters who participated

664
00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:00,720
if you remember 2016 that was a pretty

665
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:03,760
highly contested presidential election

666
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:06,320
and it got about 60 turnout which is

667
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:08,559
considered actually high

668
00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:12,320
by u.s standards of those

669
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:16,799
about 17 were cast in person but before

670
00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:19,480
election day through early voting about

671
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:21,039
24

672
00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:24,400
were cast by mail and the remaining

673
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:28,240
82 million um uh ballots

674
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:31,760
were cast in person at a local precinct

675
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:35,440
so um mostly we vote in person that's

676
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:36,240
how

677
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:39,679
it's um uh generally

678
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:41,520
going throughout most of the country

679
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:44,080
though some states rely more heavily or

680
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:46,159
or almost exclusively

681
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:49,679
on mail-in voting but every state allows

682
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:52,640
some mail-in voting for things like

683
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,880
absentee ballots and so on

684
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:56,880
okay so how secure is all this how

685
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:58,240
reliable is all this

686
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:01,279
and how robust is all of this

687
00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:04,400
the stakes are very high and one way to

688
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,000
measure that the way i like to measure

689
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,520
that is if we think about

690
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:09,200
the amount of money that's spent

691
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:12,240
conducting political campaigns

692
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:15,520
that vastly outspends the amount of

693
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:16,960
money we spend

694
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:20,159
actually conducting elections

695
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:22,480
so the people who are spending money to

696
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:24,159
influence how you vote

697
00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:27,200
um have a lot more resources than the

698
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:29,120
people who are

699
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:32,320
trying to ensure that everything runs

700
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:34,480
smoothly and that everybody is given the

701
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:36,320
opportunity to vote and that the votes

702
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:36,799
are

703
00:26:36,799 --> 00:26:40,480
are count counted properly traditionally

704
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:41,039
we've

705
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:44,640
worried about corrupt candidates

706
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:47,279
and their supporters doing things like

707
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:47,919
buying

708
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:50,960
votes or adding ballots or taking

709
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:53,600
ballots out of a ballot box or

710
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:55,679
interfering with the count and we have a

711
00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:58,080
lot of mechanisms to make that difficult

712
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:00,080
in practice and in fact

713
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:01,919
it generally is pretty difficult to do

714
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:03,279
that although we'll talk a little bit

715
00:27:03,279 --> 00:27:03,679
about

716
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:07,760
how technology can affect that

717
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:12,080
but more concerningly

718
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:14,799
the systems are designed to provide

719
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:15,840
safeguards

720
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:18,640
against that traditional threat but

721
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:20,240
there's another threat that we hadn't

722
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:21,840
really considered

723
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:24,960
on a large scale before 2016 which is

724
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:28,320
foreign state adversaries and foreign

725
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:30,480
state adversaries are a little different

726
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:30,880
from

727
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:34,159
traditional attackers in an election

728
00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:35,039
system

729
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:38,320
because they um might not

730
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:41,919
want to choose a winner they may be

731
00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:44,240
satisfied with simply disrupting

732
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:48,000
the overall process and uh

733
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,600
and casting doubt on the legitimacy of

734
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,039
the outcome

735
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:55,360
um or making it difficult for people to

736
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:57,440
vote or to know who won

737
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:01,440
uh and that is both a an easier goal

738
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:04,880
and one for which many different

739
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:08,000
kinds of attacks

740
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,840
than the kinds of attacks where you want

741
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:11,279
to actually pick the winner

742
00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:14,080
might be possible so a good question we

743
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:14,880
have to ask

744
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:17,279
is given this very broad threat model

745
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:19,840
does any given voting technology that we

746
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:20,880
want to use

747
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:23,279
help enable mischief or does it help

748
00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:24,000
prevent

749
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,559
mischief is it making us more reliable

750
00:28:26,559 --> 00:28:28,399
or less reliable

751
00:28:28,399 --> 00:28:31,200
and the answer is invariably yes to both

752
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,080
questions

753
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:35,200
so this is not so usually so simple as

754
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,080
to say

755
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:38,799
this technology is completely good or

756
00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:41,600
this technology is completely bad

757
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:44,000
um it's generally a matter of a

758
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:44,799
trade-off

759
00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:47,600
and risk modeling so let's let's talk a

760
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:48,399
little bit

761
00:28:48,399 --> 00:28:52,320
about how voting technology can fail

762
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:55,679
and this is not a new problem

763
00:28:55,679 --> 00:28:59,840
it's not a problem that even has to do

764
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:02,000
necessarily with the introduction of

765
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
computer technology

766
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:07,520
so you probably recognize this picture

767
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:11,120
from the 2000 election recount

768
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:14,320
in florida this is a

769
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:18,159
a very patient election judge

770
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:21,039
carefully examining a ballot to

771
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:22,080
determine

772
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:24,559
whether the hole that's been punched in

773
00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:26,799
the ballot

774
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:30,399
reflects what was counted by machine

775
00:29:30,399 --> 00:29:34,080
and to try to determine whether or not

776
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:37,039
you can learn more about the voter's

777
00:29:37,039 --> 00:29:37,760
intent

778
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:41,120
by looking at this physical artifact

779
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:42,640
this picture is interesting because at

780
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:45,120
the time this was on the news every

781
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:47,039
night in every newspaper in the country

782
00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:48,559
on every news

783
00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:51,919
show pictures like this showing what an

784
00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:54,640
embarrassment the technology used in

785
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:56,000
florida was that it was so

786
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,760
outdated that you would have to resort

787
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:00,320
to this but in fact i think the meaning

788
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:01,200
of this

789
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:03,679
photo has now kind of inverted and we

790
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:05,120
can think of it now

791
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:07,840
not as an illustration of the weakness

792
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:09,039
of this system

793
00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:11,039
but rather as an illustration of the

794
00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:12,880
strength of the system

795
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:15,760
because a person can grant it with a

796
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:17,760
fair amount of eye strain

797
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:21,200
look at the ballot and

798
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:24,480
get a better idea of what the voter

799
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:25,840
actually intended to do

800
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:28,480
and we can discuss and argue about

801
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:29,600
whether that mark

802
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:32,640
meant is meant for one candidate

803
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:36,320
or the other and reach a human scale

804
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:40,000
agreement about what the voter's

805
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,279
intention was

806
00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:43,760
we don't have to just blindly rely on

807
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:46,159
what the technology tells us

808
00:30:46,159 --> 00:30:49,679
we can use our own judgment and maybe do

809
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:50,559
better

810
00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:52,960
than the limitations of the technology

811
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:54,399
it's kind of interesting to think about

812
00:30:54,399 --> 00:30:55,360
what went wrong

813
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:58,880
in florida the voting machine

814
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:01,840
in florida did not actually involve a

815
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:03,600
computer in it

816
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:05,519
it was only the tabulator that involved

817
00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:07,360
a computer in fact it didn't even use

818
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:08,720
electricity

819
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:10,640
the only electricity in the voting booth

820
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:11,919
was for the light bulb

821
00:31:11,919 --> 00:31:13,200
so that you could see what you were

822
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:15,679
doing when you voted

823
00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:19,200
this was a punch card system in which a

824
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:22,480
ballot would be inserted behind a little

825
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:24,559
screen with holes in it

826
00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:27,919
and a paper template

827
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:29,919
would tell you which holes corresponded

828
00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:33,039
to which candidate

829
00:31:33,039 --> 00:31:34,799
now the interesting thing about this

830
00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:36,480
technology is that you have a little

831
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:37,840
stylus

832
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:39,840
and you punch a hole through the

833
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:41,600
position associated

834
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:44,640
with your candidate but um

835
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:48,080
as the day wears on the little pieces of

836
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:49,279
cardboard

837
00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:52,640
that get punched out of the ballot

838
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:56,240
um associated with your candidate

839
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:59,279
would start to build up behind the

840
00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:00,559
position

841
00:32:00,559 --> 00:32:04,399
of that candidate's choice

842
00:32:04,399 --> 00:32:07,360
and under normal circumstances that

843
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:09,120
wasn't a big deal there was plenty of

844
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:09,840
room

845
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:13,279
but if you had massive scale turnout

846
00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:15,360
toward the end of the day it would

847
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:16,320
actually become

848
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:20,159
physically more difficult to cast a vote

849
00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:22,559
for the more popular candidate because

850
00:32:22,559 --> 00:32:23,840
they'd have

851
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:26,880
more pieces of cardboard chad it was

852
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,000
called

853
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,559
built up behind the positions and it

854
00:32:30,559 --> 00:32:31,919
would be harder to

855
00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:35,039
put the stylus through and sometimes

856
00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:36,559
instead of making a clean

857
00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:39,600
hole as you can see in position 68 here

858
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:42,640
you'd only make like a little dimple in

859
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:44,159
it

860
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:45,840
as you can see in the middle and you

861
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:47,200
might think you voted

862
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:49,840
but when the tabulating machine which

863
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:50,799
works by

864
00:32:50,799 --> 00:32:53,440
passing light through each position

865
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:54,640
attempts to read it

866
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:56,559
it doesn't think you voted for anyone

867
00:32:56,559 --> 00:32:57,919
because it's still

868
00:32:57,919 --> 00:33:00,159
opaque even though a human being could

869
00:33:00,159 --> 00:33:01,360
look at that

870
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:03,760
and pretty easily tell that oh yeah you

871
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:04,640
tried to

872
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:07,519
to punch through that position another

873
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:09,120
possibility is that you'd make a little

874
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:10,159
flap

875
00:33:10,159 --> 00:33:12,640
and when the ballots were stacked

876
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:14,159
together

877
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:16,240
that flap might close up when it's put

878
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:18,080
into the reader

879
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:20,799
so the effect was it took a long time we

880
00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:22,159
had to do a tedious

881
00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:24,320
recount it ended up being kind of

882
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:25,919
stopped midway through

883
00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:29,039
because the supreme court

884
00:33:29,039 --> 00:33:32,000
ruled that the election needed to be

885
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,600
certified

886
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:36,799
and that was controversial and while it

887
00:33:36,799 --> 00:33:39,120
satisfied the winner with the outcome

888
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:42,159
i don't think anybody was satisfied with

889
00:33:42,159 --> 00:33:43,360
the process

890
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:46,320
in florida um even though that process

891
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:48,159
if it had been allowed to continue

892
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:50,840
would have probably given us a more

893
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:51,919
decisive uh

894
00:33:51,919 --> 00:33:55,840
result so what this did lead to

895
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:58,960
was in this very contested election an

896
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:02,880
exercise of enormous bipartisanship

897
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:05,519
congress passed the help america vote

898
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:07,039
act

899
00:34:07,039 --> 00:34:10,239
in 2003

900
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:13,440
and this mandated

901
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:18,239
a shift to accessible voting technology

902
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:19,760
that is things that could be used by

903
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:21,760
voters with a range of physical

904
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:24,399
capabilities um not necessarily

905
00:34:24,399 --> 00:34:25,839
requiring you

906
00:34:25,839 --> 00:34:28,879
to have to put put a stylus through

907
00:34:28,879 --> 00:34:31,119
a hole and it was in intended basically

908
00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:32,560
to provide funding

909
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:35,760
to modernize voting but

910
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:38,879
java required that

911
00:34:38,879 --> 00:34:41,599
the voting technology available in the

912
00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:42,560
precinct

913
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:45,839
had to be accessible

914
00:34:45,839 --> 00:34:48,960
to a very wide range of voters

915
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:52,480
and what that really meant was that

916
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:54,879
none of the current equipment that most

917
00:34:54,879 --> 00:34:56,159
places were using

918
00:34:56,159 --> 00:35:00,560
complied with the requirements of hava

919
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:02,960
but there was substantial funding for

920
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:04,880
states from the federal government

921
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:08,240
to buy new voting equipment and uh

922
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:09,920
the unfortunate thing was at the time it

923
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:12,160
was passed that voting equipment mostly

924
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:15,280
didn't exist now java allowed for a

925
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:18,079
wide range of voting tech but the most

926
00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:20,160
popular the most prominent

927
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:25,040
was what's called a dre voting machine

928
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:28,240
dre stands for direct recording

929
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:30,880
electronic and what that actually means

930
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:32,400
is this is a computer

931
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:35,760
usually a touch screen computer that uh

932
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:39,760
displays the ballot on a computer screen

933
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:42,480
and records in computer memory

934
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:43,280
internally

935
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:45,920
who you voted for very modern and the

936
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:46,720
experience is

937
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:50,400
is often compared to using an atm

938
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,520
you know something that's fairly

939
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:53,440
familiar to most

940
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:55,839
voters so it seems like a very modern

941
00:35:55,839 --> 00:35:56,960
new

942
00:35:56,960 --> 00:36:00,640
type of technology so let me make a very

943
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:03,200
obvious observation here which is that

944
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:04,320
this is in fact

945
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:07,440
computerized voting uh voting machines

946
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:09,119
and ballot scanners

947
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:12,800
um are at this point

948
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:15,359
computers and what by computers what i

949
00:36:15,359 --> 00:36:16,079
mean is

950
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:18,240
they have a general design they're not

951
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:20,240
constructed from top to bottom with all

952
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:21,359
their components

953
00:36:21,359 --> 00:36:23,920
to be voting machines somewhere in there

954
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:26,000
is a general purpose computer

955
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:29,440
controlled by software and that software

956
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:31,680
is generally provided by the vendor

957
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:34,640
and the provisioning and configuration

958
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:35,920
is generally done

959
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:38,880
by other computers at the county that

960
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:39,520
are often

961
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:42,720
networked pcs connected indirectly or

962
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:43,680
indirectly

963
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:46,079
to the internet and then the results

964
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:47,200
that come out of them

965
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:50,480
are in turn tallied by computers

966
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:54,800
often on the same networked pcs

967
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:58,560
and the results are sent from precincts

968
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:01,839
via some sort of storage media that can

969
00:37:01,839 --> 00:37:02,480
only be

970
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:05,760
read by computers so software

971
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:09,200
ends up touching almost every component

972
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:12,320
of a modern election

973
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:15,119
so another way to think about that is

974
00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:17,119
that the integrity of the election

975
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:17,760
results

976
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:21,119
depends or can depend on the integrity

977
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:24,079
of software and hardware the outcome of

978
00:37:24,079 --> 00:37:26,320
the election might be under control of

979
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:27,200
software

980
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:29,119
so the correctness of any software

981
00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:31,440
you're depending on for that purpose

982
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:34,480
is critically important

983
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:38,320
now um i'm not going to um

984
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:40,079
belabor this point because we have an

985
00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:41,440
entire conference

986
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:44,079
devoted to it but software is really

987
00:37:44,079 --> 00:37:46,800
hard to secure it's hard to

988
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:49,520
generally make software correct we don't

989
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:50,960
have general techniques

990
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:54,640
to do that complexity makes it harder

991
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:57,839
large systems pretty much always

992
00:37:57,839 --> 00:38:00,240
have bugs in them and sometimes those

993
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:00,880
bugs

994
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:04,640
can be used to hide malicious behavior

995
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:08,480
or can be uh triggered in ways to cause

996
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:11,200
malicious behavior and software is

997
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:12,400
designed

998
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:15,920
to be replaceable and uh to be

999
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:19,359
easily changed and that's true often

1000
00:38:19,359 --> 00:38:21,680
even if you're not authorized to do that

1001
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:24,000
so if a voting system is recording your

1002
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:27,119
choices exclusively electronically

1003
00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:29,119
that means that you have to trust not

1004
00:38:29,119 --> 00:38:31,520
only that the software is correct

1005
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:34,800
but that the software

1006
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:37,440
that you think is correct is actually

1007
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:38,320
the software

1008
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:41,040
that was running this is a really hard

1009
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:42,720
problem

1010
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:45,200
there's software all over election

1011
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:46,079
systems

1012
00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:48,240
their software used before the election

1013
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:49,920
to define ballots

1014
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:51,760
to provision and configure voting

1015
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:53,119
machines and also

1016
00:38:53,119 --> 00:38:56,160
to manage voter registration databases

1017
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:59,119
there's software used on election day at

1018
00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:00,960
the precinct

1019
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:04,960
to vote in the case of dre voting

1020
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:06,480
machines and often

1021
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:09,440
to register and check in voters with

1022
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:10,800
what are called electronic

1023
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:13,680
poll books and then after the election

1024
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:15,760
we use software to tally and report the

1025
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:16,720
results

1026
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:19,760
and to manage audits and recounts so

1027
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:22,560
software is all over the place here

1028
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:24,800
so there are a lot of potential

1029
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:26,800
vulnerabilities

1030
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:29,599
that might involve tampering with either

1031
00:39:29,599 --> 00:39:30,560
data

1032
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:33,760
or software itself that manages this

1033
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:35,359
and if the system isn't designed

1034
00:39:35,359 --> 00:39:38,640
carefully you may not be able to detect

1035
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:41,760
that that's happened or recover from it

1036
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:44,960
if you do detect that that's happened

1037
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:46,880
so let me just make a very humble

1038
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:48,640
observation which is that

1039
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:51,680
software security and reliability is

1040
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:55,040
hard and it's hard even under ideal

1041
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:56,160
circumstances

1042
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:58,960
in relatively low stakes environments

1043
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:00,400
and if you don't believe me

1044
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:02,240
just stick around for the rest of this

1045
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:04,240
conference and

1046
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:06,160
you know you'll see lots of examples of

1047
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:08,079
that so let's let's look

1048
00:40:08,079 --> 00:40:11,359
at this specific question how secure

1049
00:40:11,359 --> 00:40:15,359
is voting when we add computers to it

1050
00:40:15,359 --> 00:40:19,680
in principle um you know in theory

1051
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:21,359
this is a pretty simple problem there

1052
00:40:21,359 --> 00:40:23,040
should be a line somewhere in the

1053
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:23,760
software

1054
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:26,400
that says votes for the candidate equals

1055
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:28,480
votes for the candidate plus one

1056
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:30,079
when you try to cast a vote for that

1057
00:40:30,079 --> 00:40:31,760
candidate um

1058
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:34,079
and you know auditing the software

1059
00:40:34,079 --> 00:40:35,599
should be a matter of looking for that

1060
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:36,400
line

1061
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:38,560
making sure it's there making sure it's

1062
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:40,480
not surrounded by some if statement that

1063
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:41,760
says if democrat

1064
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:43,200
vote you know add one vote if

1065
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:45,119
republicans subtract one vote

1066
00:40:45,119 --> 00:40:48,079
or uh something that says add two votes

1067
00:40:48,079 --> 00:40:48,800
or

1068
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:50,400
something like that just as long as this

1069
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:53,040
is in there in principle then

1070
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:55,760
you're you're counting the tally

1071
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:57,359
correctly

1072
00:40:57,359 --> 00:41:01,359
but as either

1073
00:41:01,359 --> 00:41:05,040
yogi berra or john von neumann famously

1074
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:05,760
said

1075
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:07,839
in theory theory and practice are the

1076
00:41:07,839 --> 00:41:08,800
same thing

1077
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:11,520
but in practice they're different and in

1078
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:12,480
elections

1079
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:15,040
in practice we have a much larger attack

1080
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:17,839
surface than just that one line of code

1081
00:41:17,839 --> 00:41:19,520
we have to worry about the county

1082
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:21,440
election management software

1083
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:23,839
we have to worry about the software in

1084
00:41:23,839 --> 00:41:24,640
voting

1085
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:27,119
machines themselves we have to worry

1086
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:30,240
about the communications protocols

1087
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:32,640
typically that involve moving removable

1088
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:34,800
media maybe usb sticks

1089
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:37,280
around and we have to worry about the

1090
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:38,160
physical

1091
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:41,440
and human scale protocols often

1092
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:46,480
that involve a big temporary workforce

1093
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:49,760
so um there are this attack surface

1094
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:51,839
and the range of threats in the threat

1095
00:41:51,839 --> 00:41:53,040
model is

1096
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:56,240
very broad um everything from denial of

1097
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:57,200
service

1098
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:59,920
to altering or forging precinct counts

1099
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:02,000
or compromising the tally

1100
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:05,359
or deleting records and then possibility

1101
00:42:05,359 --> 00:42:06,160
of viral

1102
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:09,119
propagation where compromising one

1103
00:42:09,119 --> 00:42:10,880
component of the system

1104
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:12,880
can end up compromising every other

1105
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:14,960
component in the county

1106
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:18,079
and unfortunately these attacks

1107
00:42:18,079 --> 00:42:21,280
are not merely theoretical um when

1108
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:24,000
computer scientists have been asked to

1109
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:24,319
look

1110
00:42:24,319 --> 00:42:27,280
at voting systems invariably what they

1111
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:29,040
discover is that there are practical

1112
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:30,000
ways to do

1113
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:33,119
all of these things and in fact every

1114
00:42:33,119 --> 00:42:34,319
current voting system

1115
00:42:34,319 --> 00:42:37,520
that's been examined is terrible in

1116
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:40,560
in some way and probably uh

1117
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:43,920
exploitable now i this is not all

1118
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:45,040
terrible news

1119
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:47,359
uh one piece of good news is that

1120
00:42:47,359 --> 00:42:49,280
finding this out is better than not

1121
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:50,480
finding it out

1122
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:52,800
and uh we have an exemption from the

1123
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:55,119
digital millennium copyright act for

1124
00:42:55,119 --> 00:42:55,440
good

1125
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:57,839
faith security research that

1126
00:42:57,839 --> 00:42:59,119
specifically

1127
00:42:59,119 --> 00:43:02,319
allows voting machines

1128
00:43:02,319 --> 00:43:06,079
and this was just renewed

1129
00:43:06,079 --> 00:43:09,520
two years ago it's up for renewal again

1130
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:12,800
this year and effectively it makes it

1131
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:14,960
legal to buy surplus voting machines and

1132
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:16,480
take them apart and

1133
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:18,880
reverse engineer the software and look

1134
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:21,599
for and report weaknesses and in fact

1135
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:24,000
if you stick around for defcon we have a

1136
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,520
voting village

1137
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:28,560
in which we encourage people to learn

1138
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:31,920
how to do this and uh um you'll hear

1139
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:35,680
quite a bit about that um if if you uh

1140
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:37,040
head over to def con i'm one of the

1141
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:39,359
organizers of that and it's

1142
00:43:39,359 --> 00:43:42,480
it's both um uh frightening because

1143
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:44,400
these are systems that we actually use

1144
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:47,440
to run elections but also heartening

1145
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:50,000
because we can look we can examine we

1146
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,079
can report these flaws and we can

1147
00:43:52,079 --> 00:43:53,920
think about ways of improving these

1148
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:55,280
systems

1149
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:58,000
so what should we actually do um one

1150
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,440
thing we could do is just not have

1151
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:01,440
elections until we fix this but that's

1152
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:02,240
not

1153
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:05,440
a particularly viable uh

1154
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:09,040
approach if you ask the internet um

1155
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:11,119
they're pretty unanimous that there are

1156
00:44:11,119 --> 00:44:13,040
two solutions to this problem

1157
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:15,040
um one is that you shouldn't use

1158
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:16,720
software just go back

1159
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:19,200
to hand counting paper ballots put into

1160
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:20,880
a box

1161
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:23,040
and the other is that you should use

1162
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:24,400
more software that is

1163
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:26,880
everyone should vote on the blockchain

1164
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:28,560
and if you ask people who've not thought

1165
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:29,839
about this before

1166
00:44:29,839 --> 00:44:33,040
one of those two extremes of no software

1167
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:36,000
or more software is the solution to this

1168
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:36,960
problem

1169
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:39,520
and unfortunately once you start digging

1170
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:40,800
in

1171
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:43,760
neither of those simple solutions are as

1172
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:45,839
viable as they might sound

1173
00:44:45,839 --> 00:44:49,040
so the no software extreme is just hand

1174
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:50,560
count all the ballots

1175
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:53,760
cast on paper uh unfortunately u.s

1176
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:54,800
elections

1177
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:57,839
are really complex and

1178
00:44:57,839 --> 00:45:00,079
the number of ballot choices that we

1179
00:45:00,079 --> 00:45:01,920
make on an individual ballot and the

1180
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:02,319
sheer

1181
00:45:02,319 --> 00:45:05,920
scale of the operation means that the

1182
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:08,880
amount of work required to do a complete

1183
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:11,520
hand count in most places

1184
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:14,960
is truly enormous and

1185
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:18,240
probably infeasible and it's not clear

1186
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:21,760
that in fact that at scale people

1187
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:24,480
will do a better job routinely counting

1188
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:26,319
and doing these repetitive tasks of

1189
00:45:26,319 --> 00:45:27,520
looking at ballots

1190
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:30,640
than software would um and remember that

1191
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:32,960
this is more than just

1192
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:34,640
the voting machines that we have to

1193
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:36,960
think about replacing we also have a lot

1194
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:38,880
of other processes that depend on

1195
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:39,599
software

1196
00:45:39,599 --> 00:45:41,040
that are going to be very hard to

1197
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:44,240
eliminate voter registration databases

1198
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:47,359
the reporting the websites in which

1199
00:45:47,359 --> 00:45:49,920
information is available all of those

1200
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:52,000
are part of the attack surface too

1201
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,079
and it's really hard to imagine ways in

1202
00:45:54,079 --> 00:45:55,440
2020

1203
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:58,319
of eliminating all dependence on

1204
00:45:58,319 --> 00:46:01,200
software for all aspects of elections

1205
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:04,000
when you add to that the problem of

1206
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:05,119
accessibility

1207
00:46:05,119 --> 00:46:06,960
not everybody can hand mark a piece of

1208
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:09,760
paper computers can help a lot

1209
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:12,319
and computers solve real problems that

1210
00:46:12,319 --> 00:46:14,800
election officials have

1211
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:17,839
so the other extreme is more software

1212
00:46:17,839 --> 00:46:19,599
just vote on the blockchain

1213
00:46:19,599 --> 00:46:20,880
right we've all heard about the

1214
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:23,119
blockchain it somehow is a way of

1215
00:46:23,119 --> 00:46:26,400
producing money out of thin air

1216
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:28,800
unfortunately the blockchain actually

1217
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:31,040
makes us more dependent on software

1218
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:33,280
in particular it makes us dependent on

1219
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:34,720
the software

1220
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:37,760
integrity of the client what gets put on

1221
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:39,680
the blockchain in the first place

1222
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:43,280
you can't tell

1223
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:45,520
every operation required to do something

1224
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:47,280
with the blockchain because it requires

1225
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:49,359
an enormous number of steps

1226
00:46:49,359 --> 00:46:51,200
you need a computer to put something on

1227
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:53,680
the blockchain and you need to trust

1228
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:57,359
that that computer is truly reflecting

1229
00:46:57,359 --> 00:46:59,359
what your choice is and that's the same

1230
00:46:59,359 --> 00:47:00,640
problem we had

1231
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:04,240
with the dre voting machines

1232
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:06,160
there are other issues civil elections

1233
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:07,839
aren't actually a decentralized

1234
00:47:07,839 --> 00:47:09,839
consensus process

1235
00:47:09,839 --> 00:47:12,079
they're they're actually something with

1236
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:14,160
somebody in charge who's responsible for

1237
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:15,920
certifying election results so

1238
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:18,160
it doesn't quite match the blockchain

1239
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:18,960
even though at first

1240
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:22,000
glance it kind of sounds like it does um

1241
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,960
and finally the blockchain addresses

1242
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:27,119
tamper detection but it doesn't help us

1243
00:47:27,119 --> 00:47:28,640
with recovery

1244
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:30,800
so it's easy to detect that something

1245
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:32,400
isn't on the blockchain but then what do

1246
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:33,520
you do

1247
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:36,559
um detection isn't sufficient

1248
00:47:36,559 --> 00:47:39,440
okay so we've got a problem that we need

1249
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:39,839
some

1250
00:47:39,839 --> 00:47:42,880
software to run elections

1251
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:45,760
because as a practical matter we can't

1252
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:47,040
really live without

1253
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:50,400
software and computers um but

1254
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:52,800
uh we don't want to depend on it and

1255
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:53,680
there have been

1256
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:56,880
this is a a problem we've grappled with

1257
00:47:56,880 --> 00:47:59,520
for two decades now of how do we do

1258
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:01,359
elections that take advantage of

1259
00:48:01,359 --> 00:48:02,480
software

1260
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:05,599
without depending on software and there

1261
00:48:05,599 --> 00:48:07,680
were two breakthroughs

1262
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:11,440
in the 21st century um here

1263
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:13,040
that i'm going to call out specifically

1264
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:15,040
that were enormous breakthroughs

1265
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:17,599
the first was a formalization from ron

1266
00:48:17,599 --> 00:48:18,800
revest

1267
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:23,040
called software independence

1268
00:48:23,359 --> 00:48:25,200
and this is essentially a requirement

1269
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:26,880
for voting systems

1270
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:30,000
that um you should design your voting

1271
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:30,480
system

1272
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:34,000
in a way that an undetected

1273
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:37,040
change or error in the software

1274
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:39,680
can't cause an undetectable change or

1275
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:41,040
error in the election

1276
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:43,440
outcome it doesn't say you can't use

1277
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:44,400
software

1278
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:47,680
it says you shouldn't depend on software

1279
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:50,800
for the outcome in ways that you can't

1280
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:53,839
detect um and then

1281
00:48:53,839 --> 00:48:56,000
but that he didn't tell us how to do it

1282
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:59,599
he said this is a desirable property

1283
00:48:59,599 --> 00:49:02,240
and then a statistician named philip

1284
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:02,960
stark

1285
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:06,240
at uc berkeley came along with

1286
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:08,559
a method for doing this with certain

1287
00:49:08,559 --> 00:49:10,800
types of voting machines

1288
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:13,839
particularly optical scan paper ballot

1289
00:49:13,839 --> 00:49:15,280
voting machines

1290
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:18,319
and he essentially said if you use a

1291
00:49:18,319 --> 00:49:19,680
statistical method

1292
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:22,720
to sample a subset of

1293
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:25,920
ballots or or

1294
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:29,119
a subset of results and you

1295
00:49:29,119 --> 00:49:33,839
choose them carefully in a rigorous way

1296
00:49:33,839 --> 00:49:37,280
you can audit a subset of ballots

1297
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:40,720
compare their outcome with the true

1298
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:44,880
um with the reported outcome and

1299
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:48,960
uh if they're the same if you do this

1300
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:52,240
enough you can

1301
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:55,359
have very high confidence with that can

1302
00:49:55,359 --> 00:49:55,760
be

1303
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:58,960
mathematically quantified

1304
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:02,240
that your reported election account

1305
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:05,280
results are the same results you'd get

1306
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:07,599
by hand counting all the ballots but

1307
00:50:07,599 --> 00:50:09,440
without having to hand count all the

1308
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:10,640
ballots

1309
00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:12,960
and these two ideas have become kind of

1310
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:14,079
the the gold

1311
00:50:14,079 --> 00:50:18,000
standard for uh election security

1312
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:21,359
uh at the beginning of 2020.

1313
00:50:21,359 --> 00:50:24,400
so um you know there's been progress we

1314
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:24,880
finally

1315
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:27,599
know how to do this well uh and election

1316
00:50:27,599 --> 00:50:29,920
security at the beginning of the year

1317
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:32,640
was a matter of getting it implemented

1318
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:33,040
um

1319
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:35,200
and in fact we've had some progress on

1320
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:37,599
that the paperless voting machines are

1321
00:50:37,599 --> 00:50:38,480
slowly

1322
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:40,960
being replaced by optical scan paper

1323
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:42,160
that's compatible

1324
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:44,400
with the risk limiting audit techniques

1325
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:46,480
a few states are starting to employ risk

1326
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:48,800
limiting audits it's catching on

1327
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:50,480
there have been bills in congress to

1328
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:52,559
fund states to shift to paper ballots

1329
00:50:52,559 --> 00:50:55,359
none of them have have really passed but

1330
00:50:55,359 --> 00:50:56,079
mostly

1331
00:50:56,079 --> 00:50:58,880
it's been pretty good uh legislative

1332
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:00,000
language

1333
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,480
and some bipartisan support for for

1334
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:03,520
doing this

1335
00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:05,280
so you know there was reason for

1336
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:07,040
optimism

1337
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:09,040
and in fact all this stuff was the part

1338
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:10,400
that computer scientists have

1339
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:12,800
traditionally worried about in elections

1340
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:15,520
to a large extent we you know we were

1341
00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:16,000
having

1342
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,640
some um confidence we could pat

1343
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:20,000
ourselves on the back that

1344
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:23,440
we were really doing a good job here um

1345
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:26,400
and uh in fact if you're interested in

1346
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:27,280
in this

1347
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:29,200
i can't recommend anything more highly

1348
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:31,680
than the national academies securing the

1349
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:32,400
vote

1350
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:34,880
consensus study if you want to learn

1351
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:36,880
about the state-of-the-art

1352
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:38,880
voting and the path forward this is a

1353
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:40,400
great document if you google for

1354
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:41,839
securing the vote

1355
00:51:41,839 --> 00:51:44,559
uh you can find a free pdf download of

1356
00:51:44,559 --> 00:51:47,040
it it's about 180 pages long

1357
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:48,880
and really worth your time if you're

1358
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:50,160
interested

1359
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:53,200
in the problems of securing elections

1360
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:54,960
so if i were giving this talk in

1361
00:51:54,960 --> 00:51:57,920
february of 2020

1362
00:51:57,920 --> 00:52:00,319
this would be the end i'd say well we

1363
00:52:00,319 --> 00:52:02,000
finally know what to do we kind of have

1364
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:02,319
our

1365
00:52:02,319 --> 00:52:05,440
our technological marching orders uh yay

1366
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:06,800
we can declare a certain amount of

1367
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:07,440
victory

1368
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:10,000
and and be optimistic that going forward

1369
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:11,520
we will one day

1370
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:14,559
uh secure our elections really well and

1371
00:52:14,559 --> 00:52:16,319
then

1372
00:52:16,319 --> 00:52:19,440
the pandemic came along and that added a

1373
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:20,880
whole new

1374
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:24,400
set of concerns that were always there

1375
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:27,680
but that got brought very sharply into

1376
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:28,559
focus

1377
00:52:28,559 --> 00:52:32,000
so what about voting in emergencies what

1378
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:35,760
about exception handling for voting

1379
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:38,480
so there can be a number of disruptions

1380
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:39,440
for voting

1381
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:42,640
um everything from individual voters who

1382
00:52:42,640 --> 00:52:44,319
aren't able to get to their polling

1383
00:52:44,319 --> 00:52:46,160
place on election day

1384
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:49,440
to regional emergencies like

1385
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:52,079
earthquakes or power failures things

1386
00:52:52,079 --> 00:52:52,480
like

1387
00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:56,880
katrina and sandy 911

1388
00:52:56,880 --> 00:52:59,920
that might disrupt

1389
00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:02,559
some fraction of people from being able

1390
00:53:02,559 --> 00:53:03,680
to vote

1391
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:05,280
and then we have national scale

1392
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:06,800
emergencies

1393
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:09,920
things like civil wars or

1394
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:14,079
pandemics not that that could happen

1395
00:53:14,079 --> 00:53:16,559
and all of these are addressed in in

1396
00:53:16,559 --> 00:53:17,920
different ways and

1397
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:21,119
increasingly difficult and and

1398
00:53:21,119 --> 00:53:24,559
increasingly um ad hoc when they when

1399
00:53:24,559 --> 00:53:25,520
they occur

1400
00:53:25,520 --> 00:53:27,599
so let's start with the simplest one

1401
00:53:27,599 --> 00:53:30,480
because maybe we can build from that

1402
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:32,960
individual voters can be disrupted so

1403
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:34,559
some voters will be out of town on

1404
00:53:34,559 --> 00:53:35,680
election day

1405
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:38,000
others will not be able to travel to the

1406
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:39,599
polling place because they have some

1407
00:53:39,599 --> 00:53:40,800
disability or

1408
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:43,359
they have to work or whatever and the

1409
00:53:43,359 --> 00:53:44,720
usual mechanism

1410
00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:46,559
and it's available everywhere in the

1411
00:53:46,559 --> 00:53:48,000
united states

1412
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,559
is what's often called an absentee

1413
00:53:50,559 --> 00:53:53,040
ballot or a mail-in ballot

1414
00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:56,079
and this is available

1415
00:53:56,079 --> 00:53:58,920
everywhere it's a fairly predictable

1416
00:53:58,920 --> 00:54:00,400
well-established

1417
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:03,119
concept in general election officials

1418
00:54:03,119 --> 00:54:04,559
can predict how many people

1419
00:54:04,559 --> 00:54:07,280
are going to need to vote by this

1420
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:09,119
absentee method

1421
00:54:09,119 --> 00:54:12,319
some jurisdictions permit anyone to

1422
00:54:12,319 --> 00:54:14,319
request an absentee ballot even

1423
00:54:14,319 --> 00:54:17,520
if you're not going to be away that's

1424
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:19,760
called no excuse absentee

1425
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:23,040
voting in general and there are

1426
00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:24,880
exceptions there are states that that

1427
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:27,440
rely on mainland voting very heavily

1428
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:30,559
places like oregon but in most places

1429
00:54:30,559 --> 00:54:31,200
this is

1430
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:34,240
augmenting on fairly small scale

1431
00:54:34,240 --> 00:54:36,640
the in-person voting method we still by

1432
00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:39,359
and large vote in person

1433
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:42,480
more than half vote in person

1434
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:46,240
on election day but

1435
00:54:46,559 --> 00:54:49,440
we have this sort of safety valve for

1436
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:52,319
individual circumstances

1437
00:54:52,319 --> 00:54:55,440
so then we have local emergencies or

1438
00:54:55,440 --> 00:54:57,359
regional scale emergencies

1439
00:54:57,359 --> 00:54:59,680
and these don't happen every day but

1440
00:54:59,680 --> 00:55:00,640
they're

1441
00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:02,559
reasonably common we know they will

1442
00:55:02,559 --> 00:55:04,000
occasionally happen

1443
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,160
and they're difficult if they occur

1444
00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:07,440
around election day

1445
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:10,559
things like an earthquake or a hurricane

1446
00:55:10,559 --> 00:55:13,200
can disrupt voting um there might be

1447
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:15,280
precincts unable to open

1448
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:17,520
such as in hurricane sandy where many

1449
00:55:17,520 --> 00:55:19,280
polling places

1450
00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:21,440
weren't available because they had been

1451
00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:23,040
flooded

1452
00:55:23,040 --> 00:55:26,559
voters might be displaced or otherwise

1453
00:55:26,559 --> 00:55:28,480
unable to vote in their normal way as we

1454
00:55:28,480 --> 00:55:29,599
saw in hurricane

1455
00:55:29,599 --> 00:55:32,720
katrina in

1456
00:55:32,720 --> 00:55:35,760
the gulf states uh area

1457
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:40,000
um 911 2001 is remembered

1458
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,640
as uh the attacks on the world trade

1459
00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:44,480
center and the pentagon

1460
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:47,760
but it was also a primary election for

1461
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:48,319
mayor

1462
00:55:48,319 --> 00:55:50,960
in new york city that was very heavily

1463
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:52,160
contested

1464
00:55:52,160 --> 00:55:54,960
and that election had to be postponed

1465
00:55:54,960 --> 00:55:56,480
because of course

1466
00:55:56,480 --> 00:56:00,480
the city effectively shut down on 9 11.

1467
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:03,040
so we have a really strong bias to keep

1468
00:56:03,040 --> 00:56:04,079
going

1469
00:56:04,079 --> 00:56:06,480
when there's a a local and regional

1470
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:08,400
emergency try to accommodate as many

1471
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:10,000
voters as we can

1472
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,559
but postponing an election really

1473
00:56:12,559 --> 00:56:14,000
requires something

1474
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:17,760
of the scale of 9 11 before we

1475
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:21,359
we consider doing it

1476
00:56:21,359 --> 00:56:23,359
and then we have the rarest which are

1477
00:56:23,359 --> 00:56:25,680
national scale emergencies

1478
00:56:25,680 --> 00:56:28,960
um things like war or

1479
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:32,640
a large-scale cyber attack perhaps or

1480
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:35,920
as we're seeing now perhaps uh pandemics

1481
00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:36,960
that make it

1482
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:39,760
difficult to conduct voting in the

1483
00:56:39,760 --> 00:56:40,480
normal

1484
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:44,160
way um so

1485
00:56:44,160 --> 00:56:46,319
disrupting voting on a national scale

1486
00:56:46,319 --> 00:56:48,559
has national implications particularly

1487
00:56:48,559 --> 00:56:50,480
if we talk about elections for national

1488
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:52,880
office

1489
00:56:53,119 --> 00:56:55,920
such as we're going to have in november

1490
00:56:55,920 --> 00:56:56,400
um

1491
00:56:56,400 --> 00:56:58,880
it can raise questions about the

1492
00:56:58,880 --> 00:56:59,839
legitimacy

1493
00:56:59,839 --> 00:57:02,799
of newly elected officials if people

1494
00:57:02,799 --> 00:57:04,960
haven't been able to vote

1495
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:08,319
um and at the extreme we have you know

1496
00:57:08,319 --> 00:57:11,760
generally untested continuity of

1497
00:57:11,760 --> 00:57:13,200
government plans

1498
00:57:13,200 --> 00:57:16,240
that are kind of last resorts for

1499
00:57:16,240 --> 00:57:16,960
keeping

1500
00:57:16,960 --> 00:57:19,280
the government functioning under

1501
00:57:19,280 --> 00:57:21,359
extraordinary circumstances

1502
00:57:21,359 --> 00:57:23,520
and one of them involves postponing

1503
00:57:23,520 --> 00:57:24,480
elections

1504
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:27,359
so this is kind of the worst case option

1505
00:57:27,359 --> 00:57:30,640
it's obviously very highly disruptive

1506
00:57:30,640 --> 00:57:33,119
for certain elections we don't really

1507
00:57:33,119 --> 00:57:35,359
know what the rules are

1508
00:57:35,359 --> 00:57:38,160
because they haven't been tested before

1509
00:57:38,160 --> 00:57:39,839
you know what happens if we're not

1510
00:57:39,839 --> 00:57:41,760
able to hold the presidential election

1511
00:57:41,760 --> 00:57:43,520
on time uh does the

1512
00:57:43,520 --> 00:57:45,119
current speaker of the house become

1513
00:57:45,119 --> 00:57:46,880
acting president

1514
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:49,520
we hope not to find out the answers to

1515
00:57:49,520 --> 00:57:51,119
questions like that it's a

1516
00:57:51,119 --> 00:57:54,240
very very disruptive thing but even then

1517
00:57:54,240 --> 00:57:56,400
it may be preferable to holding an

1518
00:57:56,400 --> 00:57:58,960
election

1519
00:57:59,599 --> 00:58:02,799
that people regard as a legitimate um so

1520
00:58:02,799 --> 00:58:04,000
the decision

1521
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,000
to postpone an election in a national

1522
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,079
emergency is a really

1523
00:58:08,079 --> 00:58:11,440
really difficult one so let's look at

1524
00:58:11,440 --> 00:58:12,480
some of the properties

1525
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:15,040
of an emergency like the one that we

1526
00:58:15,040 --> 00:58:17,920
might be facing in november

1527
00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:19,680
we have an increase in the number of

1528
00:58:19,680 --> 00:58:21,440
voters who are unable

1529
00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:24,559
to vote in person and maybe

1530
00:58:24,559 --> 00:58:26,559
an increase in the number of local

1531
00:58:26,559 --> 00:58:27,760
administrators

1532
00:58:27,760 --> 00:58:30,559
who can't operate all of their normal

1533
00:58:30,559 --> 00:58:32,079
polling places

1534
00:58:32,079 --> 00:58:34,079
so people may not be able to vote in

1535
00:58:34,079 --> 00:58:36,079
their normal way

1536
00:58:36,079 --> 00:58:38,880
in much larger numbers than previously

1537
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:40,240
anticipated

1538
00:58:40,240 --> 00:58:41,760
we might have an increase in the number

1539
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:44,079
of people who are displaced

1540
00:58:44,079 --> 00:58:46,000
and have to vote from someplace else

1541
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:47,359
maybe they're in a hospital maybe

1542
00:58:47,359 --> 00:58:49,520
they're quarantined somewhere

1543
00:58:49,520 --> 00:58:52,880
maybe they're at a different location

1544
00:58:52,880 --> 00:58:56,000
while they wait out the emergency the

1545
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,160
pandemic or what have you

1546
00:58:58,160 --> 00:59:01,359
so we see basically an increase pressure

1547
00:59:01,359 --> 00:59:02,559
on the exception

1548
00:59:02,559 --> 00:59:05,680
processing mechanisms and

1549
00:59:05,680 --> 00:59:07,760
we see increased pressure at the same

1550
00:59:07,760 --> 00:59:10,559
time we have decreased resources

1551
00:59:10,559 --> 00:59:14,240
and some of this is

1552
00:59:14,240 --> 00:59:17,119
predictable but some of it may not be

1553
00:59:17,119 --> 00:59:20,720
easily anticipated particularly

1554
00:59:20,720 --> 00:59:23,680
with respect to when and where and how

1555
00:59:23,680 --> 00:59:24,960
many

1556
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:28,319
so basically emergencies

1557
00:59:28,319 --> 00:59:31,760
are likely to require scaling up our

1558
00:59:31,760 --> 00:59:33,440
exception mechanism

1559
00:59:33,440 --> 00:59:37,599
which mostly involves male in voting

1560
00:59:37,599 --> 00:59:40,079
so let's look at what the properties of

1561
00:59:40,079 --> 00:59:40,640
that are

1562
00:59:40,640 --> 00:59:44,400
in some detail absentee voting

1563
00:59:44,400 --> 00:59:47,119
by mail is permitted everywhere in the

1564
00:59:47,119 --> 00:59:49,599
u.s every u.s voter has that option if

1565
00:59:49,599 --> 00:59:51,280
they're not going to be present

1566
00:59:51,280 --> 00:59:53,839
in their community on election day but

1567
00:59:53,839 --> 00:59:55,280
the scale

1568
00:59:55,280 --> 01:00:00,720
varies in the strictest places

1569
01:00:00,720 --> 01:00:02,720
you need a reason you need to certify

1570
01:00:02,720 --> 01:00:05,280
that you will be out of town for example

1571
01:00:05,280 --> 01:00:08,400
and that's a small fraction of voters

1572
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:11,440
who will meet that requirement

1573
01:00:11,440 --> 01:00:13,440
and probably a fairly predictable one

1574
01:00:13,440 --> 01:00:16,240
under normal circumstances

1575
01:00:16,240 --> 01:00:19,200
then you have no excuse required

1576
01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:20,480
absentee voting

1577
01:00:20,480 --> 01:00:22,319
and there if you prefer to vote by mail

1578
01:00:22,319 --> 01:00:24,640
you just can

1579
01:00:24,640 --> 01:00:26,480
and that's a larger fraction of voters

1580
01:00:26,480 --> 01:00:28,000
who avail themselves of of

1581
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:32,240
that option and

1582
01:00:32,240 --> 01:00:36,319
places that allow no excuse voting

1583
01:00:36,319 --> 01:00:39,839
generally have larger scale capabilities

1584
01:00:39,839 --> 01:00:42,160
already there and then you have some

1585
01:00:42,160 --> 01:00:43,839
places that rely

1586
01:00:43,839 --> 01:00:48,160
almost exclusively by on vote by mail

1587
01:00:48,160 --> 01:00:50,240
you vote by mail unless you really want

1588
01:00:50,240 --> 01:00:52,079
to vote in person

1589
01:00:52,079 --> 01:00:54,160
and they don't have large numbers of

1590
01:00:54,160 --> 01:00:55,520
local precincts and

1591
01:00:55,520 --> 01:00:58,079
states like oregon fall into this uh

1592
01:00:58,079 --> 01:00:58,799
category

1593
01:00:58,799 --> 01:01:01,599
but these are overall in the country the

1594
01:01:01,599 --> 01:01:03,440
exception rather than the rule

1595
01:01:03,440 --> 01:01:05,839
today most places are either excuse or

1596
01:01:05,839 --> 01:01:07,680
no excuse

1597
01:01:07,680 --> 01:01:11,440
absentee so a question is how do we

1598
01:01:11,440 --> 01:01:14,480
scale up this mechanism

1599
01:01:14,480 --> 01:01:18,079
in an emergency and this is

1600
01:01:18,079 --> 01:01:21,040
not a theoretical question by which i

1601
01:01:21,040 --> 01:01:22,000
mean this is a

1602
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:25,920
systems and logistics question

1603
01:01:25,920 --> 01:01:27,839
we have to look at how we actually do

1604
01:01:27,839 --> 01:01:30,160
this what the operational details are

1605
01:01:30,160 --> 01:01:32,240
what are the resources required how do

1606
01:01:32,240 --> 01:01:33,920
we deploy them

1607
01:01:33,920 --> 01:01:36,880
so let's let's look at absentee voting

1608
01:01:36,880 --> 01:01:37,359
so

1609
01:01:37,359 --> 01:01:40,640
the user experience for

1610
01:01:40,640 --> 01:01:44,079
absentee ballots is pretty simple you

1611
01:01:44,079 --> 01:01:45,520
request your ballot

1612
01:01:45,520 --> 01:01:50,240
you mark it you put it in an envelope

1613
01:01:50,240 --> 01:01:53,280
and then you put it in a second

1614
01:01:53,280 --> 01:01:57,520
envelope and on the outer envelope

1615
01:01:57,520 --> 01:02:00,000
you have identifying information on the

1616
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:01,280
inner envelope

1617
01:02:01,280 --> 01:02:04,640
you don't um you sign

1618
01:02:04,640 --> 01:02:07,920
your name on the outer envelope

1619
01:02:07,920 --> 01:02:10,240
that has your identifying information on

1620
01:02:10,240 --> 01:02:11,200
it but

1621
01:02:11,200 --> 01:02:13,760
the envelope contained within that if

1622
01:02:13,760 --> 01:02:16,079
you followed the instructions correctly

1623
01:02:16,079 --> 01:02:17,599
shouldn't have any information that

1624
01:02:17,599 --> 01:02:20,000
identifies you and just contains

1625
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:22,799
your ballot itself and then you drop it

1626
01:02:22,799 --> 01:02:24,000
in a mailbox

1627
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:27,280
maybe with postage and maybe not

1628
01:02:27,280 --> 01:02:30,559
um okay so that's

1629
01:02:30,559 --> 01:02:34,000
the voter side of this what's the actual

1630
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,720
workflow in the election office how does

1631
01:02:36,720 --> 01:02:38,559
this actually happen

1632
01:02:38,559 --> 01:02:40,720
well there are a number of steps the

1633
01:02:40,720 --> 01:02:43,119
voter requests the ballot

1634
01:02:43,119 --> 01:02:46,000
um the we when the voter requests the

1635
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:47,760
ballot they have to be removed from the

1636
01:02:47,760 --> 01:02:49,440
in-person poll book

1637
01:02:49,440 --> 01:02:53,039
and sent a ballot package

1638
01:02:53,280 --> 01:02:55,440
the voter hopefully receives the ballot

1639
01:02:55,440 --> 01:02:57,200
package fills it out

1640
01:02:57,200 --> 01:02:59,440
sends it back by mail correctly with the

1641
01:02:59,440 --> 01:03:01,280
signature on the outer envelope

1642
01:03:01,280 --> 01:03:03,440
it has to be received or mailed by some

1643
01:03:03,440 --> 01:03:04,559
deadline

1644
01:03:04,559 --> 01:03:06,880
when it's received the signature has to

1645
01:03:06,880 --> 01:03:09,440
be checked against the signature on file

1646
01:03:09,440 --> 01:03:12,319
if it's if it's a match as it should be

1647
01:03:12,319 --> 01:03:13,760
in most cases

1648
01:03:13,760 --> 01:03:16,559
the outer envelope is removed the inner

1649
01:03:16,559 --> 01:03:18,720
envelope is sent off for batch

1650
01:03:18,720 --> 01:03:20,720
scanning now without the voter's

1651
01:03:20,720 --> 01:03:22,240
identity

1652
01:03:22,240 --> 01:03:25,359
if the signature didn't match chances

1653
01:03:25,359 --> 01:03:27,760
are it was from the legitimate voter but

1654
01:03:27,760 --> 01:03:30,720
there's some exception handling process

1655
01:03:30,720 --> 01:03:33,839
that has to be

1656
01:03:33,839 --> 01:03:36,559
introduced at this point called curing

1657
01:03:36,559 --> 01:03:37,520
the signature

1658
01:03:37,520 --> 01:03:41,599
mismatch and then finally the accepted

1659
01:03:41,599 --> 01:03:42,559
ballots

1660
01:03:42,559 --> 01:03:45,280
are separated from the identifying

1661
01:03:45,280 --> 01:03:46,079
information

1662
01:03:46,079 --> 01:03:48,640
and scanned all at once so we don't know

1663
01:03:48,640 --> 01:03:50,559
whose individual ballot of the ones that

1664
01:03:50,559 --> 01:03:51,920
were accepted

1665
01:03:51,920 --> 01:03:55,520
came from which voter but if we've

1666
01:03:55,520 --> 01:03:58,640
done this correctly and well then

1667
01:03:58,640 --> 01:04:00,799
um we have high confidence that all the

1668
01:04:00,799 --> 01:04:02,400
accepted ballots are the ones that got

1669
01:04:02,400 --> 01:04:03,599
scammed

1670
01:04:03,599 --> 01:04:05,440
um the machines that do this back

1671
01:04:05,440 --> 01:04:07,920
scanning are big and expensive these are

1672
01:04:07,920 --> 01:04:08,240
not

1673
01:04:08,240 --> 01:04:10,480
off the shelf components these are these

1674
01:04:10,480 --> 01:04:11,280
are basically

1675
01:04:11,280 --> 01:04:14,559
industrial machines um

1676
01:04:14,559 --> 01:04:16,559
this is an example of one from esns

1677
01:04:16,559 --> 01:04:18,559
called an m650

1678
01:04:18,559 --> 01:04:20,240
so a question is how do you scale this

1679
01:04:20,240 --> 01:04:21,760
up uh

1680
01:04:21,760 --> 01:04:24,640
this is a pretty labor intensive process

1681
01:04:24,640 --> 01:04:26,079
sending the ballots out

1682
01:04:26,079 --> 01:04:28,160
to the voters who need them and

1683
01:04:28,160 --> 01:04:30,880
processing the marked ballots are both

1684
01:04:30,880 --> 01:04:35,200
um very um human intensive processes

1685
01:04:35,200 --> 01:04:37,839
that often involve checks by multiple

1686
01:04:37,839 --> 01:04:38,799
people

1687
01:04:38,799 --> 01:04:42,880
and have to be done properly

1688
01:04:42,880 --> 01:04:45,760
or the integrity of the election can get

1689
01:04:45,760 --> 01:04:48,079
called into question

1690
01:04:48,079 --> 01:04:50,640
the exception handling aspects of this

1691
01:04:50,640 --> 01:04:52,799
things like signature mismatches

1692
01:04:52,799 --> 01:04:55,119
are even more labor-intensive you have

1693
01:04:55,119 --> 01:04:58,079
to follow up with the voter in some way

1694
01:04:58,079 --> 01:05:00,880
so and then if you're going to do this

1695
01:05:00,880 --> 01:05:03,039
on a larger scale not only do you need

1696
01:05:03,039 --> 01:05:04,799
to

1697
01:05:04,799 --> 01:05:08,319
provide for all of this work that has to

1698
01:05:08,319 --> 01:05:09,920
be done by human beings

1699
01:05:09,920 --> 01:05:12,319
over a pretty short time and that's

1700
01:05:12,319 --> 01:05:14,160
really critical for the integrity of the

1701
01:05:14,160 --> 01:05:15,039
election

1702
01:05:15,039 --> 01:05:16,480
but you also have to worry about things

1703
01:05:16,480 --> 01:05:18,240
like

1704
01:05:18,240 --> 01:05:20,160
how many ballots do you have how many

1705
01:05:20,160 --> 01:05:22,319
envelopes do you have and

1706
01:05:22,319 --> 01:05:24,319
how what's the throughput of your

1707
01:05:24,319 --> 01:05:26,319
scanning capability

1708
01:05:26,319 --> 01:05:28,000
and if you've only got the throughput

1709
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,880
for the normal absentee ballot process

1710
01:05:30,880 --> 01:05:35,599
you may not have enough to

1711
01:05:35,599 --> 01:05:38,079
accommodate a really large increase in

1712
01:05:38,079 --> 01:05:39,520
the last minute

1713
01:05:39,520 --> 01:05:42,400
of the number of these mail-in ballots

1714
01:05:42,400 --> 01:05:43,039
uh and

1715
01:05:43,039 --> 01:05:45,599
worse you may not just be able to go to

1716
01:05:45,599 --> 01:05:47,119
your local kinkos or

1717
01:05:47,119 --> 01:05:51,520
fedex office and print new ballots

1718
01:05:51,520 --> 01:05:53,520
because often ballots have security

1719
01:05:53,520 --> 01:05:55,839
features involving infrared reflective

1720
01:05:55,839 --> 01:05:57,839
and infrared opaque

1721
01:05:57,839 --> 01:06:01,760
inks and then you've got the

1722
01:06:01,760 --> 01:06:04,400
storage and management of all this paper

1723
01:06:04,400 --> 01:06:06,960
coming in at the same time

1724
01:06:06,960 --> 01:06:10,000
we have security issues the scanners

1725
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,000
themselves have to be

1726
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,799
audited risk limiting audits are still

1727
01:06:14,799 --> 01:06:16,960
necessary there's very high pressure on

1728
01:06:16,960 --> 01:06:19,200
the chain of custody

1729
01:06:19,200 --> 01:06:23,039
and things like denial of service

1730
01:06:23,039 --> 01:06:25,200
where voters are given incorrect

1731
01:06:25,200 --> 01:06:27,359
instructions or voter registration roles

1732
01:06:27,359 --> 01:06:29,760
with addresses are tampered with

1733
01:06:29,760 --> 01:06:32,240
have serious implications so where do we

1734
01:06:32,240 --> 01:06:33,680
go from here

1735
01:06:33,680 --> 01:06:35,440
uh should we be optimistic or

1736
01:06:35,440 --> 01:06:37,119
pessimistic for november

1737
01:06:37,119 --> 01:06:39,440
and i think the the answer is yes to

1738
01:06:39,440 --> 01:06:40,720
both

1739
01:06:40,720 --> 01:06:42,880
um there's reason to be optimistic and

1740
01:06:42,880 --> 01:06:44,400
reason to be pessimistic

1741
01:06:44,400 --> 01:06:46,480
let's start with the pessimism the first

1742
01:06:46,480 --> 01:06:48,480
is that there's a lot of uncertainty

1743
01:06:48,480 --> 01:06:50,480
about how many voters who'd otherwise

1744
01:06:50,480 --> 01:06:51,760
vote in person

1745
01:06:51,760 --> 01:06:54,079
will need mail-in ballots and we're

1746
01:06:54,079 --> 01:06:55,920
likely not to know

1747
01:06:55,920 --> 01:06:58,799
until it's too late to change course and

1748
01:06:58,799 --> 01:07:01,280
that means we need to prepare for a very

1749
01:07:01,280 --> 01:07:03,520
wide range of scenarios

1750
01:07:03,520 --> 01:07:05,839
that may not come to fruition so we may

1751
01:07:05,839 --> 01:07:06,720
need to print

1752
01:07:06,720 --> 01:07:08,400
lots of ballots that we don't end up

1753
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:09,920
using and also

1754
01:07:09,920 --> 01:07:11,920
provide for lots of in-person voting

1755
01:07:11,920 --> 01:07:13,760
that might not um

1756
01:07:13,760 --> 01:07:18,000
be used under pandemic conditions

1757
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,720
it's likely that most jurisdictions are

1758
01:07:20,720 --> 01:07:22,559
going to not be have the funding to do

1759
01:07:22,559 --> 01:07:24,720
this themselves or other resources to do

1760
01:07:24,720 --> 01:07:27,280
this themselves their the expertise and

1761
01:07:27,280 --> 01:07:29,760
the personnel most don't have budgets

1762
01:07:29,760 --> 01:07:30,400
for this

1763
01:07:30,400 --> 01:07:33,520
um and time is really short the election

1764
01:07:33,520 --> 01:07:36,880
is less than 100 days away

1765
01:07:36,880 --> 01:07:39,200
many of these problems the logistical

1766
01:07:39,200 --> 01:07:40,720
aspects of this

1767
01:07:40,720 --> 01:07:43,760
are familiar to computing specialists um

1768
01:07:43,760 --> 01:07:46,400
the operational uh environment under

1769
01:07:46,400 --> 01:07:48,319
uncertainty and emergencies so our

1770
01:07:48,319 --> 01:07:49,119
expertise

1771
01:07:49,119 --> 01:07:52,240
in this community is central to many

1772
01:07:52,240 --> 01:07:54,960
of the problems that we have here and i

1773
01:07:54,960 --> 01:07:55,520
think

1774
01:07:55,520 --> 01:07:57,839
the optimistic note is that we can do

1775
01:07:57,839 --> 01:07:58,960
this

1776
01:07:58,960 --> 01:08:02,160
but we need to engage now so

1777
01:08:02,160 --> 01:08:05,280
let me end with a kind of call to arms

1778
01:08:05,280 --> 01:08:05,839
that

1779
01:08:05,839 --> 01:08:08,640
this community is precisely the one

1780
01:08:08,640 --> 01:08:10,240
whose help

1781
01:08:10,240 --> 01:08:12,640
is among others going to be needed by

1782
01:08:12,640 --> 01:08:13,680
your local

1783
01:08:13,680 --> 01:08:15,760
election officials call them find out

1784
01:08:15,760 --> 01:08:17,600
what their plans are

1785
01:08:17,600 --> 01:08:20,238
find out how you can help do they need

1786
01:08:20,238 --> 01:08:22,319
poll workers do they need judges to help

1787
01:08:22,319 --> 01:08:23,759
with the signature matching

1788
01:08:23,759 --> 01:08:27,279
do they need i.t expertise

1789
01:08:27,279 --> 01:08:29,759
find out and and engage with them and i

1790
01:08:29,759 --> 01:08:31,920
think we can do this but we have to want

1791
01:08:31,920 --> 01:08:32,719
to

1792
01:08:32,719 --> 01:08:35,600
and we have to we have to all take

1793
01:08:35,600 --> 01:08:37,279
responsibility for this

1794
01:08:37,279 --> 01:08:40,560
so thanks very much and i look forward

1795
01:08:40,560 --> 01:08:41,120
to

1796
01:08:41,120 --> 01:08:43,439
to talking to all of you if we have time

1797
01:08:43,439 --> 01:08:48,158
in the question and answers
