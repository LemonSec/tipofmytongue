00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:20,160
okay so

3
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:22,480
hello blackhead and thank you for

lanphone

7
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:29,599
real-time passive sound recovery using

8
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:33,599
light emitted from a hanging bulb

9
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:36,160
and i will start by introducing myself

10
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:36,800
i'm a comp

11
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:39,120
i'm a computer scientist and a former

12
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:40,640
google employee

13
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,559
i'm a phd student at the bengal

14
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:44,719
university of the negev and a researcher

15
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:46,399
at cyber bgu

16
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:48,399
my research focus our privacy and

17
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:50,399
security of iot devices

18
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:53,840
and you can find or read more about my

19
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:56,960
research at my website

20
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:00,719
um this is a joint work co-ordered by

21
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:03,440
me javon pirotin professor radisha meal

22
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:05,119
professor yuval alovich and dr

23
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:07,760
bois zadov all of us from ben gurion

24
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:10,840
university and weizmann institute of

25
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:12,240
science

26
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,000
and this is the agenda for today we will

27
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,360
start by introducing the research

28
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:15,920
question

29
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:17,520
we will then discuss the necessary

30
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,040
background required to understand

31
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:20,479
landform

32
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:22,720
we will discuss length and spread model

33
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:25,360
bulbs as microphones

34
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,200
i will show you the evaluation from the

35
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,560
experiments that we did

36
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,400
i will discuss potential improvements

37
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:31,600
takeaways and

38
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:34,720
questions and answers

39
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:38,720
okay so the so the primary uh question

40
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:40,000
that we ask in this research

41
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,600
is can hanging bulb be used as a

42
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,280
microphone

43
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:48,079
and my answer to you is that by using

44
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:49,600
scientific tools to analyze the

45
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,360
vibrations of a hanging

46
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:54,000
bulb attackers can effectively recover

47
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,680
high quality speech

48
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,799
and non-speech audio now i will start

49
00:01:58,799 --> 00:01:59,759
with a warning

50
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:01,439
turning hanging light bulb into a

51
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:03,680
microphone is very challenging task

52
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,360
and probably some of you asking yourself

53
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:07,600
why the reason is that

54
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,280
light bulbs were not exactly designed to

55
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,878
be used as microphones so during the

56
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:12,239
next 35 minutes

57
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:14,080
i will do everything that i can in order

58
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,360
to convince you that

59
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,520
eavesdroppers can basically overcome

60
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,040
this challenge if they

61
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:22,720
know what to look for

62
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,640
okay so let's start to discuss about the

63
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,080
necessary background to understand

64
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:26,959
landform and

65
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:29,520
uh we will start by discussing uh sound

66
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,319
waves

67
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:32,480
uh now here are three interesting facts

68
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:33,920
about the soundwave

69
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,840
first of all soundwave is basically air

70
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,760
traveling through space

71
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:40,720
which its source can be some object that

72
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,239
causes a vibration

73
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:45,360
for example a person's vocal cords

74
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,360
and here is another interesting fact

75
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,480
acoustic waves that

76
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:51,440
have frequencies from around 20 hertz to

77
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:52,640
20 kilohertz

78
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:55,680
can be held by humans now this

79
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,360
actually leads us to discuss about

80
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,000
eavesdropping now according to wikipedia

81
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
eavesdropping is the act of secretly

82
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,239
recovering sound from a target or a

83
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:05,040
victim

84
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:08,239
without his consent and

85
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:10,720
eavesdropping comes in various forms if

86
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,080
zopping can be performed

87
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:14,959
digitally and physically and in this

88
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:16,840
talk we actually discuss about physical

89
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,400
eavesdropping

90
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,879
physical eavesdropping relies on objects

91
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:23,040
that are located in physical proximity

92
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:23,440
to

93
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:26,720
the sound source when a sound wave hits

94
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,959
the surface of an object it causes the

95
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:30,480
object to vibrate

96
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,720
and by analyzing the object's response

97
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:33,599
to sound

98
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:36,480
basically the vibrations with a proper

99
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:37,440
sensor

100
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:40,560
sound can be recovered

101
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,799
now this principle is being used by

102
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:44,560
microphones which are basically devices

103
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,239
that are used to convert sound

104
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:49,599
sound waves from a to electrical signal

105
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:52,480
using three uh primary components the

106
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,480
first component is a diaphragm which is

107
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,560
basically a thin piece of material

108
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,959
that vibrates when it is struck by sound

109
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:00,159
waves

110
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:02,239
the second component is the transducer

111
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:04,959
which is used to convert the vibrations

112
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:06,159
to current

113
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:08,799
and the last component is a2d which is

114
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:10,640
used to digitize the analog electric

115
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:11,439
signal to

116
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:15,840
audio signal

117
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,279
okay so i want to discuss about

118
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:21,279
eavesdropping related research and

119
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:23,360
i would mention that in recent years the

120
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,440
scientific community

121
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,440
has suggested various ways to recover

122
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,360
sound

123
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,040
all of these methods are basically can

124
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,880
be categorized into one of the following

125
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,160
categories

126
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,600
the first category is what i call the

127
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,520
internal methods and the second category

128
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,120
is what i call the external method

129
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,840
so let's start to discuss about internal

130
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:43,120
methods and internal methods are

131
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:43,919
basically

132
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:47,199
methods that rely on data which obtained

133
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:48,240
by a device

134
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:52,000
located in proximity to a victim

135
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:55,280
in recent years it was shown by

136
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:57,440
scientists that motion sensors that are

137
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,560
integrated to

138
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,039
smartphones and speakers and vibration

139
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:02,800
motors again all of which are

140
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,680
integrated to smartphones data obtained

141
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:06,080
from

142
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:08,800
these devices can be used in order to

143
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,320
eavesdrop sound

144
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:14,000
and in addition even data obtained from

145
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,840
magnetic hard drive can also be used in

146
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,039
order to eavesdrop sound

147
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:19,440
now if i will have to summarize this

148
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,039
section of internal methods

149
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:23,280
i would say that from the eavesdropper

150
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,240
perspective

151
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,720
this methods our greatest disadvantage

152
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,880
is that they are permissionless

153
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,720
which means that applications that

154
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,320
implement these methods

155
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,639
uh do not require any special

156
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:36,400
permissions or permissions at all to

157
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,840
obtain data from

158
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:41,120
these devices however this method

159
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,639
greatest disadvantage is the

160
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:44,320
the fact that they require the attacker

161
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,479
to compromise

162
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:48,560
a device with the malware and this in

163
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,960
order to obtain data and to exploit the

164
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:53,840
data to his possess

165
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,080
now the second category of method is

166
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,160
what i call the external methods which

167
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,639
are methods that rely on data obtained

168
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:02,880
by a device that is not located

169
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:06,240
near a victim and probably the most

170
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:06,880
common

171
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:10,240
uh commonly uh known uh method or the

172
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,479
most famous method is laser microphone

173
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:14,000
which basically relies on a laser

174
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,080
transceiver to recover sound by

175
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,680
directing a laser beam

176
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,919
at an object and analyzing the object

177
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:21,600
response to sound

178
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,639
and laser microphone is a traditional

179
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:27,280
method that is being used for years

180
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,520
by eavesdroppers and from the

181
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,199
eavesdropper perspective

182
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:34,639
these methods have two great advantages

183
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:36,080
the first one is that it

184
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,160
it is totally external and it doesn't

185
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,000
require as a result to pla

186
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,479
to compromise a device with the malware

187
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:44,319
and also this method can be applied in

188
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:46,000
real time

189
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,360
however this method greatest

190
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,520
disadvantage is the fact that it is

191
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:53,360
active or what i call active method um

192
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,440
the laser beam can be detected by

193
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,680
victims or organization by using

194
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:01,360
an optical a dedicated optical sensor by

195
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,360
detecting the laser beam that is being

196
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,639
used and

197
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:07,039
which implied that a laser microphone is

198
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:10,080
being used to eavesdrop sound

199
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:14,000
okay now um the second method in the

200
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,400
in the category of external methods is

201
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,080
uh the visual microphone

202
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,759
uh visual the visual microphone was

203
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:21,360
suggested six years ago by

204
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,759
a group of scientists from mit they

205
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:24,880
suggested the use of

206
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:27,440
a high frequency video camera which able

207
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:28,080
to capture

208
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,720
2000 frames per second in order to

209
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,960
recover sound by analyzing the object's

210
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:36,400
response to sound and they will manage

211
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,319
to show how a bag of chips can be used

212
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:40,639
in order to achieve this goal

213
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:43,599
by recovering speech from analyzing the

214
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:44,560
vibration of

215
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:47,599
big of chips and from the eavesdropper

216
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:49,120
perspective this method

217
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:52,879
is external as uh as the method of

218
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:55,919
a laser microphone however it has a

219
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:57,520
great advantage of

220
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,919
being passive because no laser beam is

221
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:01,280
involved in a laser

222
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:04,000
in a visual microphone making its

223
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:04,720
detection

224
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,080
very difficult for victims or

225
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,878
organizations

226
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,639
this method greatest disadvantage is the

227
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:14,479
fact that it cannot be applied in real

228
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:15,440
time

229
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,360
because this method requires heavy

230
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,280
computational resources

231
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:22,879
uh in order to process a lot of frames

232
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:23,919
in order to recover

233
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:26,639
sound which according to the outdoors it

234
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:28,479
takes a few hours to reconstruct

235
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:31,680
a few seconds of sound

236
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,200
now if i will have to summarize this

237
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,279
entire section of related work i would

238
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:36,240
say that

239
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:39,440
um each of the methods that were

240
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,000
suggested

241
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,799
over the years basically is limited in

242
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:44,640
one of the following aspects

243
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:47,360
uh some rely on remotely controlled

244
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,720
device

245
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,160
which means that eavesdropper must

246
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:54,160
compromise this device with the malware

247
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:57,200
some methods are active which makes it

248
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,320
easier for

249
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:01,440
the victim to detect the use of

250
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:04,080
such methods and some cannot be applied

251
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,040
in real time

252
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:07,360
because they require heavy computational

253
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,080
resources

254
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:12,880
so none of these methods are perfect

255
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:16,320
okay so let's discuss about lenfon's

256
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,279
threat model

257
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:20,160
and in length on the threat model we

258
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,680
actually assume that there is a

259
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:24,880
hanging light bulb which exists in a

260
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,160
target room

261
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,720
and we also assume that the sound in the

262
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,560
room which can be by the way the result

263
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,000
of a conversation

264
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,240
made in the room creates fluctuations on

265
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:37,200
the surface of the hanging bulb

266
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,040
and we also assume that there's an

267
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,640
eavesdropper an attacker

268
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,240
which basically directs an electro

269
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,839
optical sensor

270
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:47,360
at the hanging bulb vi telescope

271
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,440
now electro optical sensor is basically

272
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,800
a sensor that converts

273
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:54,160
light to voltage and

274
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,920
the optical signal that is sampled from

275
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:58,320
the electro-optical sensor

276
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,440
is digitized via a2d and processed

277
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,600
using a dedicated sound recovery

278
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,680
algorithm into an acoustic

279
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:10,399
signal we named it smd star in this case

280
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:14,000
now from an eavesdropper perspective

281
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,839
lenfon's threat model actually is

282
00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:18,560
external passive

283
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:20,959
and can be applied in real time which

284
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:21,600
means that

285
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,440
it combines the advantages of laser

286
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,040
microphone and visual microphones as

287
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:27,279
well

288
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:32,079
okay so let us discuss about how

289
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:34,560
light bulbs uh basically can be used as

290
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:35,760
microphones and

291
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:40,000
more specifically as diaphragms and

292
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,920
um basically as i mentioned before as

293
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:46,720
sound wave soundwave is basically air

294
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,399
traveling through space

295
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:50,640
and the air causes a hanging light bulb

296
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:51,839
to vibrate

297
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:54,800
it causes any object to vibrate and a

298
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:57,120
hanging light bulb as well

299
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:59,600
however above vibrations are so small

300
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,680
that they are invisible to the human eye

301
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:02,880
so

302
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,880
we start we started by asking ourselves

303
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,800
how small are these vibrations and in

304
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,640
order to answer this question we

305
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,800
conducted an experiment we actually

306
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,399
attached a gyroscope to the bottom of a

307
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:13,680
hanging bulb you can see it on the

308
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:14,000
picture

309
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,800
to the right and we produce various

310
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:17,680
sound waves

311
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,920
at different volumes from nearby

312
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,680
speakers again you can see the speakers

313
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:22,480
from

314
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:25,839
on the picture to the right and we

315
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:26,560
sample

316
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,959
the gyroscope at 800 health using

317
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:30,480
gasoline pi 3

318
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:34,399
um and these were the results that we

319
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:35,040
actually

320
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:37,440
that were obtained we computed the angle

321
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,200
as the function of the frequency

322
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,480
and when i say the frequency it's

323
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,880
basically the sine wave that was played

324
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:44,720
for fee and for theta you can see phi

325
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,160
and theta uh

326
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:49,920
in the uh schema below and

327
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:52,560
we actually created these graphs uh for

328
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,880
fee and for theta

329
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:58,000
that are presented below now by

330
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,160
analyzing the results from the graphs

331
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:03,440
we actually con we made uh conclusions

332
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:06,320
um the first conclusion is that the

333
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,519
angle of vibration

334
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:10,000
is very small it's basically in milli

335
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:10,560
degrees

336
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,560
as you can see in the graphs uh the

337
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:13,600
second conclusion

338
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:17,040
is that um the angle of vibrations

339
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,839
is not equal it changes as a fog as a

340
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:21,600
function of the frequency again you can

341
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,120
see it

342
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:26,959
on the graphs below and unsurprisingly

343
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:27,440
the

344
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:30,079
angular vibration increases as the

345
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:33,120
volume increases

346
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,800
okay now based on the known formula of

347
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,560
the spherical coordinate system

348
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:41,120
we actually computed the total movement

349
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:41,760
of the

350
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:45,120
hanging bulb taking into account phi

351
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,440
theta and the distance between the

352
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,200
ceiling and the bottom of the hanging

353
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,160
bulb

354
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:53,200
and we actually found that sound

355
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:56,399
affected the hanging light bulb causing

356
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:57,760
it to vibrate at

357
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:01,440
300 microns between the analyzer

358
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,600
spectrum

359
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:06,959
so can we detect the movement of

360
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:09,120
microns by using an electro optical

361
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,800
sensor and in order to

362
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,399
answer this question we actually

363
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:15,120
conducted another experiment

364
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,880
we actually directed an electro-optical

365
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:19,120
sensor towered hanging

366
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:20,800
light bulb as you can see in the picture

367
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,480
to the right and

368
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,160
the electro-optical sensor is mounted to

369
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,320
the telescope to the white telescope

370
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,639
on the right and we measure the voltage

371
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:30,399
that was produced by the electro-optical

372
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:32,480
sensor from various distances

373
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:35,600
between 1 meter and nine point in 9.5

374
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,160
millimeters

375
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,320
now the graph presents the result that

376
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,079
were obtained and you can see that a

377
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:43,360
different amount of voltage

378
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:45,519
is produced by the electro optical

379
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:46,399
sensor

380
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:48,800
when the sensor is placed two meters

381
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,240
away from the

382
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,959
light bulb and when the sensor is placed

383
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:55,120
uh six meters away from the light bulb

384
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:58,000
and again this is not surprising because

385
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,279
a different amount of

386
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:01,040
light is captured by the electro optical

387
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,720
since a sensor a bigger amount of light

388
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:03,040
is

389
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,639
captured by the electro optical sensor

390
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:06,240
when it is close to the

391
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:10,160
light bulb and however

392
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:12,959
we are actually interested in measuring

393
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:15,120
small movements of the bulb

394
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:18,320
rather than movements of the sensor so

395
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,480
how can the amount of light expected for

396
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:24,480
displacement of 300 microns be computed

397
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:27,519
and we actually using the results that

398
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:28,480
were obtained

399
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:30,480
from the previous experiments from the

400
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:31,760
previous experiment

401
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,680
we actually computed linear equations

402
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,199
between two consecutive points on the

403
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:35,839
graph

404
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:37,279
and you can see the linear equations

405
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:39,040
below

406
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:42,720
and based on the linear equations we

407
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,079
actually computed

408
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:46,399
the expected voltage resulting from

409
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:49,040
displacement of 300 microns

410
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:51,839
and again this is also presented on the

411
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:54,480
table below

412
00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:59,600
now let's understand uh what can be

413
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,760
learned from this table and in order to

414
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:03,199
understand let us assume that we use a

415
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:04,800
16-bit a2d

416
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,720
and the 16-bit a2d provides a

417
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,399
sensitivity of 300

418
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:10,320
micro volts you can see the calculation

419
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,519
in here

420
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:15,120
and analyzing this fact uh with respect

421
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,160
to the table

422
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:18,720
it means that the sensitivity of uh a 16

423
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:19,519
bit

424
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:21,839
a to d which provide 300 micro volts

425
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:22,880
sensitivity

426
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:26,240
uh it means that if

427
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:27,839
sensitivity of 300 microvolt is

428
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:30,000
sufficient to recover the entire

429
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,240
spectrum that was analyzed in this case

430
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:35,440
from a distance of between two and three

431
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:36,320
meters

432
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:39,040
because the smallest vibration of 300

433
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:40,000
microns

434
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,800
basically produces difference of 300

435
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,720
microvolts so it means that we can

436
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,240
actually recover the entire spectrum

437
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:46,720
from

438
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:49,839
a distance of 2.5 meters for example

439
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:51,600
however another conclusion that we

440
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,839
actually made by analyzing this

441
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:56,959
table is that in order to detect

442
00:15:56,959 --> 00:15:59,920
a pulse vibration from three meters away

443
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:00,880
from a great

444
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:04,240
from a greater distance from from

445
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:06,480
for example four meters away uh the

446
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,079
sensitivity of the system

447
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:10,880
either needs to be increased or the

448
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,240
signal obtained

449
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:15,040
needs to be amplified and later on i

450
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,079
will discuss how

451
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:18,880
each of which can be actually each of

452
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,839
these conditions can be

453
00:16:20,839 --> 00:16:25,040
satisfied okay so we understand that

454
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,959
the bulb is actually vibrating but we

455
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:28,320
ask ourselves

456
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,959
what exactly is vibrating and in order

457
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:32,160
to answer it

458
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,519
we actually obtained optical

459
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:35,600
measurements via the electro optical

460
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:36,560
sensor

461
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,240
when playing sine waves form the

462
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:39,920
speakers in

463
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:42,160
two scenarios and the first scenario is

464
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:44,639
with the diffuser covering the led bulb

465
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:46,480
and the second scenario is without a

466
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,880
diffuser covering the led bulb

467
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:52,639
and we got these results

468
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:54,720
and you can see from the graph to the

469
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:55,839
right is that

470
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:59,839
the snl decreases when a diffuser covers

471
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:02,560
the light bulb and the first conclusion

472
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,559
we made is basically that the diaphragm

473
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:05,919
is the light bulb itself

474
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:07,679
and not the diffuser it means that the

475
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:09,359
light bulb is the object that

476
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:12,000
is vibrating and the second conclusion

477
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,679
we made is basically the diffuser

478
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:14,959
decreases

479
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:17,839
uh the signal to noise ratio due to the

480
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:18,400
fact that

481
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,720
it is basically aimed at distributing

482
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,400
the light uniformly

483
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:25,119
now we ask ourselves another question

484
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:26,240
how uniform

485
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:30,480
or how uniformly is the diffuser able to

486
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:32,960
distribute the light cr distribute the

487
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,559
light across the light bulb

488
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:36,559
so in order to answer it we actually

489
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:38,880
conduct another experiment where we

490
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,640
obtained optical measurements via the

491
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:42,080
electro-optical sensor

492
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:44,880
when no sound was played near the light

493
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:45,840
bulb from

494
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:49,520
various angles these were the results

495
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:51,440
that were obtained and as you can see

496
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,840
um the diffuser doesn't distribute the

497
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,520
light uniformly

498
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:57,360
basically the amount of light that is

499
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:00,000
captured by the electro-optical sensor

500
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,120
increases when the angle between the

501
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:04,480
light bulb and the electro

502
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:06,720
optical sensor increases up to a

503
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,400
vertical point which maximizes the

504
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,360
amount of light

505
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:11,919
that is captured by the electro-optical

506
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:12,480
sensor

507
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:14,960
again all of which were done by fixing

508
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,160
the distance between

509
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,400
the light bulb and the sensor we just

510
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,559
changed the angle between them

511
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:22,400
and as a side note i would say that if

512
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,000
the diffuser was able to perfectly

513
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,400
distribute the light uniformly

514
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,960
then we were unable to detect the small

515
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,880
light changes that are the result of the

516
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:31,919
displacement of

517
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:35,039
microns and um

518
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:38,640
this is it okay so the last experiment

519
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:39,760
that we actually did

520
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:42,080
is uh we try to compare between various

521
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:42,799
types of

522
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:45,600
bulbs and we did experiment where we

523
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,840
compared the signal to noise ratio that

524
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:50,640
obtained from three types of e27 light

525
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:51,360
bulbs

526
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:53,919
um the incandescent light bulb the led

527
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:55,200
light bulb and the fluorescent light

528
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,000
bulb

529
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,760
and we found this were the results that

530
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:02,320
we obtained and we found that sound

531
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:03,919
could be reconstructed from

532
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:06,080
every type of hanging light bulb that

533
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,360
was examined

534
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:09,120
however the signal-to-noise ratio of

535
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:11,039
incandescent and led light bulb

536
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:13,679
is much higher than the snl of the flows

537
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:14,320
and

538
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,400
bulbs and this is due to the fact that

539
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:17,760
flows and bulbs

540
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:20,000
are able to distribute the light more

541
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:20,880
uniformly than

542
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,840
the other two types of bulbs that were

543
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:25,840
examined

544
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:29,679
okay so um we decided to evaluate

545
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:32,880
lampphone in real setup not in

546
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:36,320
a lab setup and in order to do so we

547
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:38,240
actually evaluated lenfon's performance

548
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:39,760
for recovering sound

549
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:42,480
from a bridge located 25 meters from an

550
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:43,840
office you can see the bridge

551
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:47,120
on the picture to the left and

552
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:48,320
i would say that the office also

553
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:51,120
contained a 12 volt e27 led

554
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:54,240
a hanging light bulb and let me show you

555
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:55,919
the experimental setup

556
00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:59,280
and afterwards you will see a video that

557
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:01,440
was taken

558
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:04,840
from where we actually conduct the

559
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:07,840
experiment

560
00:20:25,670 --> 00:20:28,799
[Music]

561
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:31,760
okay so as you can see from the video um

562
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:32,720
no sound

563
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:34,240
that is played in the office can be

564
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:36,000
heard from the bridge

565
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,520
there's an ambient light there's an

566
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:39,760
ambient sound which is the result of the

567
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:42,880
rail station that is located uh below

568
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:43,360
this

569
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:47,440
pedestrian bridge on the right corner

570
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:48,000
you can see

571
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,520
how the uh light bulb is captured from

572
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:53,280
the telescope this is basically what the

573
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:54,880
electro optical sensor

574
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:57,360
enables to see or to capture when it is

575
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:59,440
mounted to the telescope

576
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:02,960
and the first thing that we did is we

577
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,880
tried to characterize the baseline

578
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,480
and we did it by conducting an

579
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,080
experiment where we actually

580
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:10,559
obtained optical measurements via the

581
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:12,240
electro optical sensor

582
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:15,919
when no sound was played in the office

583
00:21:15,919 --> 00:21:16,400
and

584
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,799
this is the fft graph of the optical

585
00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:20,240
measurements that were obtained

586
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:23,280
um we we actually got to two interesting

587
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:25,840
results and conclusions first of all the

588
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:27,120
led bulb work

589
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:30,159
works at 100 hertz and as a result there

590
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:32,000
are peaks on the fft graph

591
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,520
at each of uh the harmonics of 200 hertz

592
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:36,080
300

593
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:38,559
etc and the first conclusion we made

594
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:39,679
from

595
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:42,720
this result is basically that we need

596
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:45,440
to filter this noise with band stop

597
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:47,039
filters

598
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:49,600
also we found that there is uh noise at

599
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,679
low frequencies which are below the 50

600
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:52,400
hertz

601
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:56,080
ah they are boxed in in red in this case

602
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:58,880
and this noise is basically is the the

603
00:21:58,880 --> 00:21:59,840
result of

604
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:03,360
um the location that we actually uh

605
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:06,320
made the uh experiment we uh put our

606
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:07,120
equipment on

607
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:10,320
a pedestrian bridge which is located

608
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:13,360
above uh a rail station

609
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:16,559
so there's a lot of noise that uh

610
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:19,280
vibrations that uh actually uh the

611
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:19,840
result of

612
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:22,640
uh the bridge vibrating and the second

613
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:24,559
conclusion that we made from this result

614
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:26,159
is basically that we need to filter this

615
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:26,880
noise

616
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:29,600
with a high pass filter now all of these

617
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:31,520
conclusions are in order to isolate

618
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:34,720
the audio signal from uh the optical

619
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:35,440
signal

620
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:38,720
without adding uh

621
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:40,880
a lot of noise to the to the audio

622
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:43,280
signal

623
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:45,360
okay now the second experiment that we

624
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:47,039
did is we tried to analyze the frequency

625
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:47,919
response

626
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:50,240
and we did it by obtaining optical

627
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:51,360
measurements

628
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:53,440
via the electro optical sensor when a

629
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,640
frequency scan

630
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:57,280
was played via speakers in proximity to

631
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:57,760
a

632
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:02,400
hanging bulb and

633
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:05,360
these are this is the results that we

634
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:07,520
actually got now we actually did it with

635
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,880
three types of

636
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:12,000
telescopes all of which have different

637
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,640
size of lens and the first conclusion

638
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:16,159
that we made is that

639
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:17,919
the signal-to-noise ratio basically

640
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:19,280
improves when

641
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:21,600
a telescope with a greater lens is used

642
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:24,480
i will explain later why

643
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:27,200
this actually happens and the second

644
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,880
conclusion we made is that

645
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:30,960
the signal-to-noise ratio is not equal

646
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:33,280
across the spectrum

647
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:35,600
so an equalizer needs to be applied in

648
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:37,840
order to balance the frequency response

649
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:39,919
of the recovered signal on the right

650
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:41,360
side you can see the equalizer that we

651
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:42,320
designed based

652
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:46,879
on the experiment that we did

653
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,080
okay now the next experiment that we did

654
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:52,640
is we tried to recover non-speech audio

655
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:55,760
and we did it by uh we played two famous

656
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:57,360
songs inside the office

657
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:59,760
let it be by the beatles and clocks by a

658
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:01,200
coldplay

659
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,120
and we obtained optical measurements and

660
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:05,440
we covered the signals and

661
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:08,559
these are the result visually opt of t

662
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:11,120
is the raw data that was obtained from

663
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:11,840
the optical

664
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:14,720
measurements smd star is basically the

665
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,000
recovered

666
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,600
signal and snd is the original signal

667
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:23,039
these are spectrograms of the uh of the

668
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:25,440
signals that were obtained and recovered

669
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:27,279
and played

670
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:29,440
and for many of you it doesn't says a

671
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,559
lot so

672
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:32,480
in order to convince you that this is

673
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:33,760
actually a

674
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:36,799
high quality signals um i will show you

675
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:38,240
videos where we shazam

676
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:40,000
the recovered signals and i will show

677
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,360
you that shazam was able

678
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:47,840
to accurately identify each one of them

679
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:57,749
[Music]

680
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:01,840
um

681
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:15,840
foreign

682
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,840
okay now as you can see shazam was able

683
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:21,919
to recognize

684
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:23,840
each and every one of these songs also

685
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:25,360
sound hound was able to

686
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:28,799
do the same thing and

687
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:30,400
the next experiment that we did is we

688
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,880
actually um decided to recover speech

689
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:33,760
audio

690
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:35,760
so we played a famous statement made by

691
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:37,520
donald trump inside the office

692
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:40,559
we will make america great again now we

693
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:42,000
obtain the optical measurements and

694
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:42,640
recovered

695
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:45,840
signals and let me uh show you

696
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:48,240
the results again opt of this the raw

697
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:48,880
data

698
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:51,360
smd star is basically the recovered

699
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:52,159
signal

700
00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:54,960
and smd is the original signal that was

701
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:57,840
played

702
00:25:58,480 --> 00:25:59,919
we decided to investigate whether the

703
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:02,159
recovered signal could be transcribed by

704
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:05,520
google speech to text engine let me show

705
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:10,640
you the results

706
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:13,840
we will make america great

707
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:17,679
again okay now as you can see

708
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:20,320
um basically this is a high quality

709
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:21,919
recovered signal which

710
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:25,120
uh uh also as you can see from the video

711
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:25,840
uh

712
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:28,880
below um google google's

713
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:30,799
speech to text engine able to accurately

714
00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:32,880
identify each and every word of it

715
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:35,360
and bear in mind that uh length on

716
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:36,159
attack

717
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:38,880
is capable of understanding president

718
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:39,440
trump

719
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:42,000
which is a very challenging task

720
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,559
nowadays

721
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,400
okay so let us discuss about the

722
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,320
potential improvements and

723
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:50,559
one potential improvement that can be

724
00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:52,240
used in order to optimize

725
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:54,799
the quality of the covered signal is

726
00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:56,320
using a telescope with a

727
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:59,360
larger lens diameter

728
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:00,799
this is due to the fact that the amount

729
00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:02,080
of light that is captured by the

730
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:03,760
telescope is a function of its

731
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:07,360
lens area and as a result a bigger

732
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:09,679
a bigger telescope with a bigger lens is

733
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:10,720
able to capture

734
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:13,440
uh a bigger amount of light and as a

735
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:14,799
result the signal-to-noise ratio is

736
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:15,919
actually optimized

737
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:19,679
uh from this uh fact and you can see it

738
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:20,480
uh

739
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:23,840
in the graph to the right

740
00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:26,320
okay another potential improvement is uh

741
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:27,039
using

742
00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:29,039
uh is optimizing the electro optical

743
00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:30,159
sensor you can do it

744
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:32,000
either by using a better or more

745
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,919
sensitive electro-optical sensor

746
00:27:33,919 --> 00:27:36,240
than the one that we used or either by

747
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:37,039
using

748
00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:39,600
multiple electro optical sensor for

749
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:42,080
multi-channel audio recovery

750
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:44,080
which is a common approach in audio

751
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:46,320
processing

752
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:48,240
okay finally there's uh you can also

753
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:50,559
optimize day to day and you can do it by

754
00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:52,559
using an a2d with a lower noise level

755
00:27:52,559 --> 00:27:54,399
than the one that we used or using

756
00:27:54,399 --> 00:27:58,399
a better a2d uh 24 30 or 32-bit a2d

757
00:27:58,399 --> 00:28:00,159
instead of the 16

758
00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:03,919
bit a2d that we used in our experiments

759
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:07,360
and also i mentioned it briefly but

760
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:10,640
um we actually used only standard

761
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:13,039
techniques of audio processing which

762
00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:14,399
involves basically

763
00:28:14,399 --> 00:28:16,000
benster filtering and high pass

764
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,320
filtering and some

765
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:20,559
equalizer and some standard denoising

766
00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:22,240
techniques

767
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:24,399
today there are much more advanced

768
00:28:24,399 --> 00:28:26,000
filtering techniques to filter noise

769
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,080
from the signal

770
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:30,799
for example deep learning is an option

771
00:28:30,799 --> 00:28:31,360
however

772
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:33,520
it comes with a cost you will have to

773
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:34,960
probably collect

774
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:37,919
data in order to train such a model and

775
00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:39,360
this is something that

776
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:42,840
probably eavesdroppers would like to

777
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:45,679
avoid so again this

778
00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:47,679
the final optimism optimization is come

779
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:51,279
with the with some cost

780
00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:54,880
okay so we are uh reaching to the end

781
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:56,320
and

782
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:58,559
i intend to discuss about the main

783
00:28:58,559 --> 00:28:59,919
takeaway that i want you to take from

784
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:00,960
this talk when

785
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:03,760
you discussing about uh this research

786
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:05,039
with your friends

787
00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:07,279
and

788
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:11,279
it is now uh 2020 however i do believe

789
00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:11,679
that

790
00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:14,480
the year of 2026 is probably going to be

791
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:16,480
a meaningful year in the life cycle

792
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:18,960
or in the lifetime of lymphoma and in

793
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:20,480
order to explain you why

794
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:22,880
i suggest to examine gyrophones

795
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:24,799
scientific progress

796
00:29:24,799 --> 00:29:26,880
now for many of you the name gyrophone

797
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:28,240
doesn't say a lot

798
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:32,000
however in 2014 uh the attack

799
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,640
of eavesdropping via motions and so uh

800
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:36,159
was revealed by a group of

801
00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:39,600
scientists from stanford university

802
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:42,720
they named it gyrophone basically they

803
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:43,760
showed that

804
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:46,960
they can classify isolated words

805
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:50,080
by obtaining data from gyrophone

806
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:52,799
that is integrated to each and every

807
00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:54,399
mobile phone nowadays

808
00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:57,200
and they show a classification model

809
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:59,679
that able to classify isolated words

810
00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:03,440
that yield only details only

811
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:05,679
results that only slight better than

812
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:06,960
random gas

813
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:09,279
also the attack vector back then relied

814
00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:10,080
on

815
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:13,039
speech at high volume and as a result if

816
00:30:13,039 --> 00:30:15,520
i will have to somehow

817
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:18,080
place the gyrophone on the scale of

818
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:19,919
practicality between not practical and

819
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:21,120
highly practical i would say the

820
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:22,480
gyrophone is probably

821
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:25,760
uh on 2014

822
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:28,240
is considered hype uh not practical at

823
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:28,960
all

824
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:32,640
however between 2015 and 2018

825
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:34,080
an increased understanding regarding

826
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:36,080
this attack vector was gained and the

827
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:37,600
accuracy of the classification one that

828
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:38,559
was improved and

829
00:30:38,559 --> 00:30:40,320
better on this understanding regarding

830
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:42,000
the experimental setup

831
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,240
was gained and some other studies even

832
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:45,440
suggested the use of

833
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:48,880
accelerometer instead of gyrophone

834
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:52,399
instead of a gyroscope and

835
00:30:52,399 --> 00:30:55,360
i would say that they actually optimize

836
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:57,519
the practicality so it will be

837
00:30:57,519 --> 00:30:59,039
somewhere in the middle between not

838
00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:01,679
practical and highly practical

839
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:05,360
and finally uh on 2020 on ndss

840
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:07,519
a group of scientists i think they are

841
00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:09,840
from china

842
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:11,840
showed how the attack vector can be

843
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:12,880
improved

844
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:15,919
so it is now i believe makes a real

845
00:31:15,919 --> 00:31:16,720
threat

846
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:20,320
or real and practical threat to privacy

847
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:21,840
they show a classification model with

848
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:23,840
the excellent accuracy

849
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:27,519
also the attack vector they show how

850
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:30,559
it can be relied at a normal volume of

851
00:31:30,559 --> 00:31:32,640
speech rather than high volume of speech

852
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:34,000
which basically they made the attack

853
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,799
very practical

854
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:40,480
nowadays now my conclusion from

855
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:41,360
analyzing

856
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:43,600
this scientific progress is that it took

857
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:44,559
six years to

858
00:31:44,559 --> 00:31:47,279
improve gyrophone to the point that it

859
00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:49,760
is now poses a real threat to privacy

860
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:52,880
and if i will have to

861
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:54,640
say something regarding lam for now so

862
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:56,480
lymphoma is probably an evolution of

863
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:58,640
visual microphone and i believe that by

864
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:00,880
making it uh

865
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:04,000
um able to satisfy uh

866
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,279
to to work in real time which

867
00:32:07,279 --> 00:32:08,960
is something that visual microphone

868
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:10,480
didn't able to provide

869
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:12,960
um we actually optimized uh the

870
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:14,320
practicality to

871
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:16,320
a pl to a place which is somewhere

872
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:18,000
between in the middle between not

873
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
practical and highly practical

874
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:23,279
and i believe that during the next

875
00:32:23,279 --> 00:32:26,799
six years and by 2026 um

876
00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:29,200
scientists will improve landforms so it

877
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:31,200
will also pose a refresh

878
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:34,000
to privacy you will probably gonna uh

879
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,120
hear about

880
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:36,960
another passionate phd student that will

881
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:38,799
come either to use next security

882
00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:42,240
or or will present his work on defcon

883
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:45,679
or at plaquette or maybe even on

884
00:32:45,679 --> 00:32:46,960
security and privacy

885
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:49,679
and he will tell you hi guys uh remember

886
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:51,679
the guys from ben gurion university that

887
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:53,360
suggested landform back then

888
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:56,000
on 2020 i was able to now make it

889
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,080
refresh to privacy i know

890
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:01,519
how to convert light to uh sound

891
00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:04,720
at a normal uh of uh

892
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:07,360
at normal volume rather than in high

893
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:08,840
volume

894
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:11,840
and

895
00:33:11,919 --> 00:33:13,679
this is the primary takeaway that i want

896
00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:16,720
you to take from this uh

897
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:20,000
from this talk now

898
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,159
i want to thank you all for attending my

899
00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:25,760
talk and if you will scan the qr code to

900
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:28,720
the right you will be able to

901
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:30,960
get into the website that we made for

902
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:33,039
lan phone

903
00:33:33,039 --> 00:33:36,799
this is probably a good time for me to

904
00:33:36,799 --> 00:33:38,720
take questions from the audience

905
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:42,000
thank you once again

906
00:33:44,399 --> 00:33:47,360
okay so i want to thank the audience uh

907
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:48,640
for attending this talk

908
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:50,960
and for the beautiful words that you

909
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:52,000
actually wrote

910
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,120
uh on the chat now i wanna

911
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:56,640
address several questions that were

912
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:59,120
raised by the audience uh imagine

913
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:02,320
uh uh imadex what is the

914
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:03,679
distance the effective distance that we

915
00:34:03,679 --> 00:34:05,120
were able to recover sound so basically

916
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:06,720
you saw in the uh

917
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:10,239
experiment it was 25 meters um

918
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:12,320
i think it was zach that mentioned or

919
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:14,239
asked how objects in the path of the

920
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:16,000
electro optical sensor influenced the

921
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:16,800
snr

922
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:19,440
so basically they are decreasing the snr

923
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:20,800
but as you can see

924
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:23,599
we were able to uh recover sound through

925
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:25,040
a carton wall

926
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:27,520
so uh basically they are decreasing the

927
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:28,320
snl but

928
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:31,520
you are still able to recover sound

929
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:34,719
um gerald said as if

930
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:37,199
uh the ambient sound near the sensor

931
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:38,000
affects

932
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,679
uh the recovery so basically the answer

933
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:41,119
is no uh you

934
00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:45,040
can see that um the experiment where the

935
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:48,800
uh uh we placed our uh

936
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:50,320
equipment on the bridge and the bridge

937
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:51,839
is located over

938
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:54,879
a rail station uh is very noisy

939
00:34:54,879 --> 00:34:58,160
and uh it doesn't affect the

940
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:01,280
recovered sound at all uh choice

941
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:03,280
asked very good question what is the

942
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:04,480
decibel level

943
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:06,720
so basically when we uh did this

944
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:07,520
experiment

945
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:09,760
it was a few months ago maybe three

946
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:11,520
months ago when we uh recorded this

947
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:12,400
experiment

948
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:16,240
um we used very high uh

949
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:19,359
volume it means around 100 decibels and

950
00:35:19,359 --> 00:35:20,000
ever

951
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,760
and three months ago this is what we

952
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:23,040
were able to do

953
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:25,359
uh during the last two weeks we were

954
00:35:25,359 --> 00:35:26,240
able to

955
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:30,079
improve uh lam phone to a level of

956
00:35:30,079 --> 00:35:33,520
70 to 80 dbs which is somehow a normal

957
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:34,640
conversation like

958
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:37,359
uh the one that i'm just uh the volumes

959
00:35:37,359 --> 00:35:37,920
that i'm

960
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:41,040
just using for this talk and we did it

961
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:44,320
i hope to uh publish the paper uh

962
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:48,160
uh soon but we were able to do it

963
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:52,400
using a desktop light bulb and

964
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:55,520
just by applying some magics to the uh

965
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:59,040
to the obtained optical measurements

966
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:02,480
um john

967
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:04,000
asked how is the directionality

968
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,320
influence so it is very influenced if

969
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:09,280
the speaker won't direct its sound to

970
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:09,599
the

971
00:36:09,599 --> 00:36:12,960
uh light bulbs so um

972
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:15,119
we won't be able to recover sound but as

973
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:16,720
long as there is somehow

974
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:19,920
air that uh

975
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:23,200
it just hits the surface of the uh the

976
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:24,880
light button you basically have a good

977
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:27,200
chance to to do things

978
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:29,599
uh how much the telescope costs so this

979
00:36:29,599 --> 00:36:30,800
is what we call uh

980
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:34,240
somehow uh uh telescopes for uh

981
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:37,359
for uh hobby uh they cost several

982
00:36:37,359 --> 00:36:38,400
hundreds of dollars

983
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:41,440
uh you can buy them by yourself

984
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:44,880
probably in walmart um regarding speech

985
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:46,480
from multiple people

986
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:48,960
this is works as well again it does not

987
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:49,680
affect

988
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:54,160
the way that sound should be recovered

989
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:56,560
and i think that this is it i want to

990
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:58,400
thank you so much for coming to this

991
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:00,160
talk and attending my talk and i hope

992
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:01,119
you had great

993
00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:03,920
great time and and you again can see

994
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:05,040
some of our

995
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:08,560
new uh uh progress in the website

996
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:11,760
that if you will scan the qr code

997
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:15,839
thank you so much
