00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:16,480
hello everyone and

3
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:18,960
welcome to a talk about unwitting

4
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:20,560
insider threat

5
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:22,560
my name is alan michaels and i'm a

6
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,800
researcher at the virginia tech hume

7
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:25,599
center

8
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:27,439
where we're helping train the next

9
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:29,199
generation of national security

10
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:31,599
practitioners

11
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:34,160
this topic was a small portion of an

12
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:35,120
18-month

13
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:37,360
undergraduate research effort we called

14
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:38,960
skiff of the future

15
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:41,440
where we worked to evaluate the myriad

16
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:42,399
technical

17
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:46,079
policy social and political constraints

18
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:47,920
of protecting information within a

19
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:49,920
secure facility

20
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,399
most of our work focused on threats

21
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:54,160
where a malicious adversary could

22
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:56,840
exploit a specific vulnerability in the

23
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:58,000
infrastructure

24
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,120
processes or people operating in a

25
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:01,920
secure

26
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:04,319
compartmented information facility or

27
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:05,280
skiff

28
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:08,640
to gain access to classified information

29
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:11,119
well most of that is not appropriate to

30
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:13,280
discuss here we did drill in on a

31
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:14,080
specific

32
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:16,640
niche question about implanted medical

33
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:17,520
devices or

34
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:21,360
imds as an emerging class of peds

35
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:24,240
that's portable electronic devices in

36
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:26,240
the facilities so

37
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:28,640
this presentation is really about

38
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,720
answering the question of how we safely

39
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:31,439
manage

40
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:34,159
and support our bionic man like steve

41
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:35,520
austin here

42
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:38,159
and permit his presence in a skiff

43
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:40,000
without becoming an unwitting

44
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,600
insider threat to national security

45
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:46,320
now before we go much further i would

46
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,159
like to recognize the student team that

47
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:49,600
worked on this effort so

48
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:53,040
kudos zoe paul eric and steven

49
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,119
i'd also like to acknowledge a journal

50
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:57,200
paper we developed on this topic which

51
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:57,600
was

52
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,360
recently published by the national

53
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,439
intelligence university

54
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:03,840
it's a more concise version of the white

55
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,439
paper that accompanies this

56
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:09,038
talk finally i'd like to throw out two

57
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:12,160
caveats for the discussion going forward

58
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:14,879
first is that all of the data here is

59
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:16,160
openly accessible

60
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:19,520
so no secrets the second is that

61
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,239
i am a wireless security guy so when i

62
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:24,080
talk about imds

63
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,400
please understand i'm not that type of

64
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,520
doctor

65
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:30,560
okay let's dive in

66
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,319
the motivation for our work can be

67
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:34,239
boiled down to one figure

68
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:36,640
where we consider the simultaneous

69
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:37,599
effects of an

70
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:40,239
aging national security workforce that

71
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:42,480
is fundamentally struggling to build and

72
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:43,519
retain

73
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:45,280
the expertise needed to support the

74
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:48,640
nation as well as the rapid evolution of

75
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,319
implant and medical devices

76
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:52,400
that are leveraging all the benefits of

77
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,959
the connected internet of things

78
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:56,800
now looking at the national security

79
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,040
workforce we're talking about an

80
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,879
older than average cross-section of the

81
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:02,159
population

82
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:04,560
which has undergone extensive background

83
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,920
checks and tends to

84
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:09,120
have very specialized expertise put it

85
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,159
simply

86
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:12,640
i've got more than my share of gray hair

87
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,239
i'm still on the younger end

88
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:16,840
of the spectrum for most defense

89
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,080
workforces

90
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:20,080
now looking at the implanted medical

91
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,480
devices we're finding that more than 5

92
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:25,360
million such devices have been installed

93
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,280
and they're helping improve the quality

94
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,280
of life via better hearing

95
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:32,159
better mobility or quite simply making

96
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:34,319
life possible in the case of things like

97
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:36,080
pacemakers

98
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:38,000
fundamental concern for these devices

99
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,680
that they are now connected to the

100
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,040
outside world

101
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,519
using iot communication protocols like

102
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:45,680
bluetooth

103
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,760
before we started this project i never

104
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,360
imagined i would see a

105
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,599
wireless connection to help manage a hip

106
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:52,560
implant

107
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:55,680
it's just weird now

108
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,000
putting these observations together and

109
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,720
making a small leap of faith of these

110
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:03,680
the overlap of the statistics we come up

111
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,680
with an estimated hundred thousand

112
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,519
cleared people in the national security

113
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:10,000
workforce that have an imd

114
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,200
that's a sufficiently large population

115
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,439
that it's hard to ignore the associated

116
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:19,199
risks arriving from policy exemptions

117
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:21,918
so let's start with imds so that we

118
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:22,720
understand

119
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:26,240
the potential targets we found a few

120
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,479
dozen different types of imds though

121
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:30,320
i'll only highlight a handful to give

122
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,320
you a flavor

123
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,479
first of all i have to say i am in awe

124
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:35,600
of how small

125
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,479
and capable some of these devices are i

126
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:40,160
remember as a college student sitting

127
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:40,960
with my then

128
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,360
83 year old grandfather and playing out

129
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:46,000
matlab generated tones to tune a graphic

130
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,560
equalizer for his audio system

131
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,880
it worked great for him but we found out

132
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,800
that the resulting audio

133
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,120
sounded like garbage to me it was also a

134
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:57,840
mismatch for grandma's hearing aids

135
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,560
well now smart hearing aids cochlear

136
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,960
implants like the white x evoke

137
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:05,199
they're incorporating cloud-based ai

138
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:06,479
algorithms that collect

139
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:09,120
feedback from population of users and

140
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,320
then roll it out

141
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,560
up with optimized corrections unique to

142
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:15,039
each user

143
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:18,639
now below it is atom this is a

144
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:21,199
wearable health sensor that helps users

145
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:21,759
monitor

146
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:24,560
breathing patterns and provides an early

147
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:27,759
warning of potential asthma attacks

148
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:30,880
while not implanted these and the smart

149
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,800
hearing aids are clearly items that

150
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:33,199
improve

151
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:36,639
quality of life for their users

152
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:40,000
next one over is open aps this is the

153
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:40,639
work of an

154
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:43,520
entire ecosystem of open source code

155
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,560
developers

156
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:47,600
supporting insulin pumps no longer is

157
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,759
this just a closed loop feedback on a

158
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:52,000
single device like the one on top

159
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,080
but rather we have communication to

160
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,319
real-time diagnostic units

161
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:58,319
enabling a user to modify their

162
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:00,720
behaviors

163
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:03,199
and next up is a subcutaneous

164
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:06,000
implantable cardiac monitor

165
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,840
it detects all kinds of heart

166
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,360
irregularities

167
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,360
has capability to alert the user via

168
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,560
bluetooth connection

169
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:15,600
to a smartphone or it also has the

170
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,880
ability to

171
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:20,080
do like an et phone home capability that

172
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,840
directly pushes the results to the

173
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,919
user's physician

174
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:27,039
and while it is a wireless and below it

175
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:28,000
sorry

176
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,639
is a wirelessly connected pacemaker with

177
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:33,360
similar capabilities

178
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,160
well let's shift over to what makes a

179
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,479
skiff a skip

180
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:41,039
within odni that's office of the

181
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:43,199
director of national intelligence

182
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:46,800
there's a 174 page specification that

183
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,720
defines the construction

184
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:52,479
and security guidelines for a skiff

185
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:54,880
in general you can think of this as the

186
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,000
collection of design

187
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,800
criteria and policy guidance for a

188
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,840
building to protect classified

189
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:02,080
information

190
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,560
beyond the guidelines each agency also

191
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,720
has leeway in implementation

192
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,880
which can lead to facility specific

193
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,319
rules

194
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:12,319
well physical security is really pretty

195
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:13,599
straightforward

196
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:16,720
these guidelines help keep people out in

197
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,880
any type of signals conversations

198
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:22,080
other classified information in given

199
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,360
security monitoring

200
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,759
and the response timelines really

201
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:27,759
nothing short of a seal team is going to

202
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:28,720
cause

203
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:31,199
gain the entry using brute force and if

204
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:34,000
they do it's not going to be quiet

205
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,319
sorry tom you'll have a harder time than

206
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:38,720
in the movies

207
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,400
the second part of security is mostly

208
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,240
about people

209
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,560
one making sure only authorized people

210
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,000
are allowed in

211
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,400
and second making sure that we minimize

212
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,840
risk

213
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:52,080
skipping over the intentional insider

214
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:54,080
threats you know the kind that result in

215
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,599
orange jumpsuits

216
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:58,080
there is a large focus on the personal

217
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,360
electronic device

218
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:03,039
peds that we carry with us those peds

219
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:05,120
and particularly those that interact

220
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,800
with outside systems

221
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,360
they're acknowledged as one as the as

222
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,879
one of the highest

223
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:14,560
risk factors in the facility

224
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,039
now most of the traditional peds have

225
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:18,960
obvious risks

226
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:21,440
nowadays a modern smartphone is almost

227
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,759
synonymous with a laptop computer

228
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:26,160
our fitness trackers smart watches all

229
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:26,800
that

230
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:30,000
they're not far behind the biggest risks

231
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:30,639
here are

232
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:32,799
two-way communications in the bazillion

233
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:34,880
sensors that are squeezed into such a

234
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,399
small package

235
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:40,399
just think maybe siri give me the

236
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:41,440
documents for

237
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:44,880
project triple z coming right up

238
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:47,040
would you like the full specification or

239
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:50,480
just the classified appendix

240
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,320
i don't know maybe that's a little

241
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,680
far-fetched

242
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:56,959
capability's certain there now

243
00:08:56,959 --> 00:08:59,040
other common items that we all carry

244
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,200
with us include things like key fobs

245
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:05,279
toys batteries even

246
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:08,080
things like shoes and e-cigarettes are

247
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,839
now getting blue to them

248
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:13,200
a little scary so practically that means

249
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,040
that it's incumbent upon

250
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:17,040
all cleared personnel to understand the

251
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,320
technologies

252
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,320
underlying any of the devices they bring

253
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,680
with them into a

254
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:24,640
secure facility

255
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,560
so when we consider the risks of these

256
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,560
pets we take into account the

257
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:33,279
mitigations that can be put in place

258
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:35,360
simple example is that it's pretty easy

259
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,360
for me to leave my cell phone

260
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,760
in a metal box outside the facility and

261
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:42,160
then collect it upon leaving

262
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:45,519
not much risk there this gift guidelines

263
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:48,399
break risk into qualitative and low

264
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:50,000
medium and high categories

265
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,640
where you can think of low as just

266
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,640
simply being acceptable

267
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,880
medium as being permitted but with some

268
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,240
restrictions

269
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:01,519
and high they're just not allowed

270
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:03,680
one of the most important parts for our

271
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:05,760
discussion are the two-way transmitters

272
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,519
in particular bluetooth

273
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:10,160
that is common to many of the imds and

274
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:10,959
clearly

275
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:14,800
a high-risk item so

276
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:17,760
as i just said these high-risk devices

277
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,839
aren't allowed into the facility

278
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:22,480
so should we automatically restrict

279
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,240
cleared personnel with imds from the

280
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,640
facility

281
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:29,360
thankfully that's not the answer there

282
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:29,839
are

283
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:32,000
a number of long-standing workforce

284
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,200
protections where

285
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,880
employers are required to make

286
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:37,040
reasonable accommodations

287
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:39,440
enabling the workforce to perform the

288
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:42,399
work that they're otherwise capable

289
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:44,320
two primary ones are the american with

290
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,720
disabilities act and the rehabilitation

291
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:49,600
act of 1973.

292
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:52,399
those protections are then reiterated in

293
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:54,320
a variety of intelligence community

294
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,279
memos

295
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:59,279
policies executive orders take your pick

296
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:02,079
those are effectively the foundation for

297
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:04,079
the medical exemptions that i'll discuss

298
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:06,079
later

299
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:08,720
so given how hard it is to recruit and

300
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:09,279
retain

301
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:11,839
talent in the national security sector

302
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:13,839
we really want to be careful not to

303
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:16,240
disqualify good people from continuing

304
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,000
their service

305
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,160
and while this remains a difficult

306
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,240
question on the other side

307
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,160
we have to consider what the critical

308
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,480
adjective reasonable means

309
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,880
because protecting our workforce and

310
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,880
protecting classified information

311
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:34,720
are both important okay

312
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,720
so i want to dig into the functionality

313
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,079
of these devices a little bit

314
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:40,320
and i somewhat loosely include the

315
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,320
wearable devices that are intended to be

316
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,480
worn regularly

317
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,800
you'll quickly notice that most of them

318
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:47,839
use bluetooth

319
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:50,399
to connect to the outside world now

320
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:51,680
bluetooth is a

321
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:53,839
wonderful protocol for the low energy

322
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:55,440
utilization of these devices

323
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:58,320
they even call it bluetooth low energy

324
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,480
yet it leaves a lot to be desired in

325
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,959
terms of security

326
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:05,519
well bluetooth is actually the baseline

327
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:08,000
protocol that we hand to undergrads

328
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,240
give them a cheap software to find radio

329
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,360
and 120

330
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:14,560
ubertooth or three to and then we teach

331
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:14,959
them

332
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:18,000
protocol reverse engineering um and what

333
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,279
we found is

334
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:21,120
basically in terms of the wireless

335
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,880
exploits for imds

336
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,880
it was almost virtually the same as

337
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:27,360
inexpensive iot devices

338
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:30,000
so a few examples the bluetooth pairing

339
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,200
process

340
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,440
offers access to critical information

341
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,839
like frequency hopping parameters

342
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:38,560
and crypto keys they're all passed in

343
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:40,480
the clear

344
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,639
manufacturers often use static or short

345
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:45,040
passwords as well as crypto keys

346
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:48,079
these are easy to crack bluetooth is

347
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:50,399
also easy to perform man in the metal or

348
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:51,519
relay attacks

349
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:53,839
with some software stacks even

350
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:56,000
supporting privilege escalation into

351
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,279
other parts of the device one of the

352
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:01,040
simplest texts and i prefer simple

353
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:02,880
stupid ones personally

354
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:05,040
it's to draw down the device's battery

355
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,000
by repeatedly

356
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,040
sending pairing requests that's a real

357
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:12,639
problem when recharging means surgery

358
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:15,279
however really none of this is new or

359
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:17,040
terribly surprising to those in the

360
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:19,040
field

361
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:21,440
so beyond bluetooth i'll note that some

362
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,360
of these devices gain their benefits

363
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,760
from cloud connectivity

364
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,600
ensuring that the user data is shared

365
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,040
with third parties

366
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,600
in our case that's a built-in tunnel for

367
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:34,560
getting information to the outside world

368
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:38,160
so simple example is if a hacked device

369
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,079
can trigger a call for something like an

370
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:41,279
ambulance

371
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:43,440
things get real messy when that

372
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,199
ambulance shows up at a classified

373
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:47,279
facility

374
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:50,639
okay the second observation is that most

375
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:52,320
of the devices have sensors and

376
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,320
transducers that monitor the outside

377
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,440
world

378
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,839
audio receptors have the obvious risk of

379
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:00,320
collecting classified conversations

380
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:02,480
while access to rf and other

381
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:04,399
environmental sensors could offer

382
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:06,720
actionable intelligence about specific

383
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:09,360
facilities

384
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,199
next up are gps receivers those are

385
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:14,880
integrated into many of the devices

386
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,800
though i will say it's more prevalent

387
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,800
in the wearables than in the implanted

388
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,639
devices

389
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:22,959
the location data that's collected is

390
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:25,120
routinely shared in monitoring

391
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,800
application downloads

392
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,959
presenting a real upside concern in

393
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:31,120
revealing the user's daily patterns of

394
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,320
life

395
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,399
and potentially even the location of

396
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:37,760
unacknowledged facilities

397
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:41,040
now a less obvious threat is the overall

398
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:44,320
manufacturing chain for imds

399
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,320
while we found that many companies in

400
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,880
the us perform the design

401
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:51,120
most manufacturing is actually performed

402
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,560
overseas

403
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:55,199
so as we've seen in recent days with the

404
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:57,519
race to create a coveted vaccine

405
00:14:57,519 --> 00:14:59,600
there's a real risk of entangling

406
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,680
national security interests with global

407
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:02,959
health interest

408
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:04,399
suggesting the opportunity for

409
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:06,320
exploitation of a device

410
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:09,440
before it's even implanted

411
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,199
so let's extend that a little bit

412
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:13,920
further evidence has already been

413
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:16,639
shown that some of these medical devices

414
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:18,160
can be hacked

415
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:20,560
i combine the technical aspects of

416
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:21,440
hacking with

417
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,760
social engineering that coerces someone

418
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,279
to steal secrets

419
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:28,240
and again we have a real problem i don't

420
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:29,040
know about you

421
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:31,279
but getting a threat that someone would

422
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:32,240
hack in and fry

423
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:34,720
my pacemaker that would really linger in

424
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:37,519
the back of my mind

425
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:41,360
now in all this i do want to give credit

426
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:43,120
to the policy developers for

427
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:45,519
recognizing medical devices as having

428
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:47,120
unique benefits

429
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:49,680
within the overall class of portable

430
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,920
electronic devices

431
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:54,480
and the guidance that has evolved over

432
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,800
the last decade demonstrates a concrete

433
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,399
awareness

434
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:01,519
the rationale behind these changes and

435
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:04,399
quite honestly our research is the

436
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:07,199
conflict with the applicable hr policies

437
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:08,000
like the american

438
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,720
with disabilities act rehabilitation act

439
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:14,959
and i see policies like 110.1

440
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:17,519
all of these seek to ensure reasonable

441
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:18,880
accommodations

442
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:21,199
and protections for otherwise capable

443
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:23,680
individuals to do their jobs

444
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:26,560
however when we attempt to apply the

445
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,880
previous security guidance to modern

446
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:32,480
connected imds it's virtually impossible

447
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:35,120
to deny that the devices in and of

448
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,320
themselves

449
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:39,759
fit into the high-risk category moreover

450
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:41,600
many of the embedded devices have

451
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,120
operational lifetimes

452
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:46,480
up to 20 years think of a pacemaker you

453
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,639
don't want to pull that out

454
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:51,199
that's a lot of time for me to devise a

455
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:51,680
tax

456
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,680
and or take advantage of new techniques

457
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:55,279
that come out

458
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:57,839
as such we've tried to put a qualitative

459
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:00,079
scoring for the devices

460
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:02,839
after current mitigations written into

461
00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:04,000
policy

462
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,799
as i mentioned before a cell phone poses

463
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:07,520
minimal

464
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:10,640
residual risk because we assume it sits

465
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,799
outside in a metal box and never enters

466
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:14,959
the facility

467
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:17,280
leaving our items at the door is the

468
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:19,119
primary mitigation for almost

469
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:22,240
all personally owned portable electronic

470
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:24,319
devices

471
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:27,359
for imds however there is no practical

472
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:29,919
way to temporarily remove them

473
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:33,200
meaning the wrist remains with the user

474
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:36,160
as technology continues to evolve we

475
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:39,280
anticipate this risk only increases

476
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:42,480
case in point at the far left there

477
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,480
we have an open source software

478
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,720
ecosystem running on a platform with a

479
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,640
two-way transmitter

480
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,559
i don't know about you but that sounds a

481
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:52,080
lot like one of the software-defined

482
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:54,880
radios i have sitting in my lap

483
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:57,679
okay one final note before we move on is

484
00:17:57,679 --> 00:17:59,360
perhaps you look at the dates

485
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:01,919
on these documents and you think imd

486
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:04,080
mitigations will just get captured in

487
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:06,960
the next revision

488
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:09,919
quite honestly we hope they do but we

489
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:11,600
also believe that the guidance

490
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:14,400
and technical mitigations need to be

491
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,600
specific enough

492
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,840
so that the imd users do not need to

493
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:18,799
worry

494
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:21,679
about an approval for their device only

495
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:25,280
being good for their home facility

496
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:30,000
so recognizing the risk of imds we've

497
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,679
tried to identify a family of

498
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:33,760
mitigations that range from nothing more

499
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:36,400
than random physical inspections

500
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:39,280
and that's kind of like the status quo

501
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:41,520
up to and including denying entry to the

502
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:42,880
facility

503
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,799
in the rare instances where the risk is

504
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:46,480
still too high

505
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:49,280
we've laid these mitigations out in a

506
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:52,080
way that simultaneously considers

507
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:54,880
technical benefit to the facility as

508
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:57,440
well as risk to the user

509
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:59,200
in the middle of this range we have

510
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,760
mitigations that hit the sweet spot

511
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:04,799
balancing risk or annoyance to the host

512
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:08,720
and benefit to promoting security

513
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:12,160
well first up is really the status quo

514
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:15,679
just accept the device as is without

515
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:18,960
any specific mitigations it's possible

516
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,799
that the device can be whitelisted to

517
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:21,280
prevent

518
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:24,320
false positives and facility scans

519
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:26,720
but no changes are required for the host

520
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:29,200
coming or going

521
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,520
the second is the use of fancy sensors

522
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:34,559
like ferromagnetic detection systems

523
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:36,559
you can use those to verify the presence

524
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:38,320
of the device

525
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:40,240
the sensors only cost about ten thousand

526
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:42,000
dollars and they've proven themselves

527
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,919
effective at identifying the presence of

528
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:46,240
virtually any foreign object

529
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:48,400
but they don't directly mitigate the

530
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,840
risks if not coupled with secondary

531
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:52,720
methods

532
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:55,600
the third and what i fall back on is

533
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,919
another simple stupid solution

534
00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:00,720
is rf shielding apparel that blocks

535
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,960
portion of the body with an imd

536
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:05,679
to reduce the overall signal levels it's

537
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:06,240
kind of like

538
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:09,120
wearing a foil safety vest as a crude

539
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:11,679
approximation of a faraday cage

540
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:14,640
it's cheap and effective though i mean i

541
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:15,520
understand

542
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:19,760
nobody wants to wear the tinfoil hat

543
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:22,400
the next option to consider are

544
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,080
zeroization techniques

545
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:25,679
similar to how we approach a piece of

546
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:27,679
test equipment

547
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:30,480
while likely effective this requires

548
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,799
knowledge of each unique device

549
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:34,559
and has the potential to zero out

550
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:37,520
important settings

551
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:39,919
another approach is to hand over c2

552
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:41,840
authority to the facility owner when you

553
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:42,640
enter

554
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:45,200
and then release it when you leave well

555
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,039
that ensures that the device

556
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:49,679
and the device if it's got high-risk

557
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:50,320
sensors

558
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:52,640
or communication capabilities they can

559
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:55,360
be limited while in the facility

560
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:57,679
and while maybe only applicable to

561
00:20:57,679 --> 00:21:00,880
removable items like hearing aids

562
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:03,039
an equivalent result can be obtained by

563
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:05,360
having an interchangeable device

564
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:08,559
that is held inside the facility and

565
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:10,080
it's managed program

566
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:14,240
strictly by the security office okay

567
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:16,000
well next we think many of the

568
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,720
transducers can be disabled by the users

569
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:21,120
which is similar to the previous one

570
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:23,919
yet this assumes a level of technical

571
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:26,559
sophistication by the user

572
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:28,880
further this is really difficult for

573
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,080
items like hearing aids

574
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:32,159
where the transducer is integral to the

575
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:35,280
device's operation

576
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:37,360
now the last one that we feel fits in

577
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:39,440
the feasible category

578
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:42,000
it's an active noise device that emits

579
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,520
enough energy

580
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:45,520
and is specific to the imd's

581
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:47,440
capabilities to prevent it

582
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:50,640
from communicating to the outside world

583
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:53,679
such devices can be transmit only more

584
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:56,320
or less making them safe by themselves

585
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:59,039
yet the down soy downside is if the

586
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:02,159
noise causes excess processing by the md

587
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:03,679
resulting in a reduction of battery

588
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:06,000
lifetime

589
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,200
okay taking that a little bit further

590
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:11,280
with active systems

591
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:13,200
number nine assumes that the facility

592
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,880
records and tracks

593
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:17,760
all wireless activity of the imd

594
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:20,559
impossible use of the sensors

595
00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:23,200
we find these methods to be much more

596
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:25,120
cumbersome and have less practical

597
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:26,000
benefit than the

598
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:30,240
others okay

599
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:34,080
the last one up is really the other

600
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:35,679
simple approach

601
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:38,240
if an imd poses such a risk that it

602
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:40,559
cannot be mitigated and i'm thinking

603
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:43,679
something crazy like a bionic eyeball

604
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:46,320
then the best choice may be to simply

605
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:46,880
deny

606
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:51,280
access given today's inability to limit

607
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:54,159
risk

608
00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:56,640
and since this is being recorded i've

609
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:58,159
included a little more detail if you

610
00:22:58,159 --> 00:22:58,559
want to

611
00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:00,880
pause here for a couple of seconds uh

612
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,480
you can read a little more about

613
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:06,159
each of the proposed mitigations

614
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:10,000
okay now in addition to the mitigations

615
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,120
we propose

616
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:13,120
i want to highlight two others that come

617
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:15,760
up regularly when i talk to folks

618
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:17,840
first being that we require the device

619
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:19,679
manufacturers to make a skiff

620
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:22,799
compatible device and the second being

621
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:26,799
the that the fda levy specific security

622
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:28,320
guidelines

623
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:30,960
well given the relatively small portion

624
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,159
of cleared imd

625
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:35,200
users only about two percent

626
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:37,120
and the fact that many of the companies

627
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:38,799
are not based in the us

628
00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:40,480
we simply don't see the first one as

629
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:41,919
feasible

630
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:44,720
the second one is a great idea we think

631
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:47,440
that parts of it will come naturally but

632
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:49,760
we also anticipate that any guidance

633
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,440
coming from the fda

634
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:53,520
it's going to be safety focused as

635
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:56,960
opposed to security focus

636
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:58,960
we see the same in most government

637
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:00,159
agencies when

638
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:02,840
they evaluate any of the new iot

639
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:04,960
technologies for use in critical

640
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:07,679
infrastructure

641
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:09,919
well to wrap up this discussion i want

642
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:11,200
to hit a

643
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:14,159
couple of takeaways the fundamental one

644
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:15,120
is that

645
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:18,400
technology is rapidly outpacing policy

646
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,159
when you look at the devices that should

647
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:22,960
be permitted in a secure facility

648
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:25,279
i haven't really given out much in terms

649
00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:27,520
of nefarious methods to exploit that

650
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:28,559
imbalance

651
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:31,600
because that really is not our intent

652
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,520
but rather we're advocating that

653
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:35,919
policies should proactively address the

654
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:36,640
technology

655
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:38,880
five years from now rather than

656
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:42,880
consistently being five years behind

657
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:46,159
now most practitioners in the field can

658
00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:48,320
readily theorize or apply

659
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:51,360
any of the related attacks here

660
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:53,520
second currently we estimate on the

661
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:55,279
order of a hundred thousand people

662
00:24:55,279 --> 00:24:58,159
included in this category of cleared

663
00:24:58,159 --> 00:25:00,640
personnel with imds

664
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:03,279
and that number is likely much higher

665
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:05,520
when you consider recreational fitness

666
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:06,480
trackers

667
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:09,679
or any other type of wearable device

668
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:11,679
this is a growing issue with many of the

669
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:12,720
people

670
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:15,679
with many people involved and also very

671
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:17,200
interested in the outcome whether they

672
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:19,440
realize it or not

673
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,679
so on the plus side many of the proposed

674
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:23,279
technical mitigations are both

675
00:25:23,279 --> 00:25:25,919
sufficient and reasonable we believe

676
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:27,679
to simultaneously address the

677
00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:30,000
constraints of protecting the health

678
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,480
of the national security workforce and

679
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:34,240
protecting the classified information

680
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:35,840
that they work on

681
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:38,799
this really shouldn't be a battle nor

682
00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:40,640
should it be acceptable

683
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,720
that hr policy creates security

684
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,400
vulnerabilities

685
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:47,440
so like many other aspects in life this

686
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:49,440
should be a balance between the risks

687
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:50,480
and benefits

688
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:53,279
to make sure that we do not unwittingly

689
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:54,000
become an

690
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,919
insider threat to the national security

691
00:25:55,919 --> 00:25:59,279
mission we've chosen to serve

692
00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:01,520
well thank you for listening to my

693
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:03,360
presentation today

694
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:05,120
i look forward to your questions and

695
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:10,559
comments at our break

696
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:13,039
hi good afternoon and uh more than happy

697
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:14,400
to take questions i've

698
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,960
answered a few that are coming online i

699
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:19,120
think first question is primarily about

700
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:20,240
the white paper

701
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:22,400
and slides looks like they will be

702
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:24,720
available tonight

703
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:26,960
but i'm more than happy to take any

704
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,320
other questions

705
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,720
on the topics this has been a fun one

706
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:39,840
for us

707
00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:46,240
okay a question about mitigations

708
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:48,799
and generally are we still doing

709
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:50,960
research at virginia tech

710
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:54,559
we definitely are i think um the focus

711
00:27:54,559 --> 00:27:57,760
is transitioning a little bit towards um

712
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:00,159
things that we won't publish um but i

713
00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:01,919
think the

714
00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:04,080
medical aspects we are getting greater

715
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:05,520
interest

716
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:07,919
and so we probably will create a

717
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:09,279
follow-up project

718
00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:10,399
with some of the students haven't

719
00:28:10,399 --> 00:28:13,199
graduated yet

720
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:16,480
um the see question about national

721
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:17,679
security positions

722
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:21,039
affected by imds um

723
00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:23,840
we actually don't have perfect numbers

724
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:24,240
so

725
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:27,360
the venn diagram i showed earlier um

726
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:29,679
we're more or less extrapolating that

727
00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:32,240
it's the same as the average population

728
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:34,080
which would say on the order of one to

729
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:35,279
two percent

730
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:37,039
um and while it sounds small that's

731
00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:39,679
still a hundred thousand people

732
00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:42,880
we are trying to get better numbers but

733
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,880
it actually is pretty well guarded

734
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:46,960
because of you know just

735
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:48,880
health regulations you don't want to

736
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:51,120
share um even in a

737
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:54,480
kind of anonymized sense so i think we

738
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:56,240
have to go with the extrapolation to

739
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:59,279
start with

740
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:03,840
emp um i don't know that i've got

741
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:06,000
a great answer on that i mean i think

742
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,679
you know we're talking about small

743
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:09,520
devices that

744
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:11,840
nobody's thinking their military grade

745
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:13,279
um i would be

746
00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:16,799
totally amazed if they'd

747
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:20,080
you know survive any type of emp and

748
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:22,080
um yeah even then like you're not going

749
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:24,159
to take them into a facility

750
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:26,080
that has high magnetic fields you know

751
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:28,559
for getting the mp

752
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:31,760
um yeah the

753
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:35,279
the mylar suit that's a little bit of a

754
00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:36,720
exaggeration i think everybody would

755
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:39,279
know that um we're looking at it as

756
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:41,679
something where at least it's a visual

757
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:44,640
um most of these devices i mean you're

758
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:45,279
talking

759
00:29:45,279 --> 00:29:48,399
the size of coins um so

760
00:29:48,399 --> 00:29:51,039
pretty easy to shield them and pretty

761
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:54,000
much if you can knock off 10 or 20 db

762
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,399
of the signal power you're going to have

763
00:29:56,399 --> 00:29:57,039
a pretty

764
00:29:57,039 --> 00:30:00,320
easy time to reduce it to where it's no

765
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:03,520
longer able to communicate

766
00:30:06,559 --> 00:30:09,360
see daria a question about uh thoughts

767
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:11,039
for a solution of the issue

768
00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:14,480
um that actually is a really hard one

769
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:16,240
and it's partially there are so many

770
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:16,799
people

771
00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:19,840
involved in the question um

772
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:22,880
that you know i think the device

773
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:23,840
manufacturers

774
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:25,840
uh they're primarily looking at it as

775
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:27,039
privacy

776
00:30:27,039 --> 00:30:30,880
um you know me just as individual if i

777
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:34,720
um have my gps location known or

778
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:36,559
you know you catch some my conversation

779
00:30:36,559 --> 00:30:38,640
talking on the phone

780
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:43,120
i mean it's not super high value um

781
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:46,159
i don't think that they or the fda are

782
00:30:46,159 --> 00:30:48,799
going to start to really look at

783
00:30:48,799 --> 00:30:50,960
a security side of it they're primarily

784
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:52,559
looking at privacy

785
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:54,559
or you know fundamentally the safety to

786
00:30:54,559 --> 00:30:55,600
the user

787
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:58,159
um so i think this is a niche solution

788
00:30:58,159 --> 00:31:00,399
that the national security

789
00:31:00,399 --> 00:31:03,039
community as a whole we have to be able

790
00:31:03,039 --> 00:31:04,000
to

791
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,720
address this and kind of adapt to what

792
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:09,840
devices are available

793
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:15,279
question on the actual hacking side of

794
00:31:15,279 --> 00:31:16,960
this

795
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:20,000
we actually decided not to attempt

796
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,279
hacking any devices

797
00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:25,760
um partially try to imagine what the irb

798
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:28,720
review would be on attacking a device

799
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:29,760
that's in a live human

800
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:32,880
uh just i'm sorry i don't want to do

801
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:33,519
that

802
00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:35,120
now you know if i'm looking at

803
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:37,039
individual chips you know say it's the

804
00:31:37,039 --> 00:31:39,200
bluetooth chip that's inside a specific

805
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:40,240
device

806
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:42,320
um there actually are some fairly good

807
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:43,440
results uh

808
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:46,640
published already on attacking this and

809
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:49,120
you can extrapolate a lot

810
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:51,440
but i don't think anybody is going to

811
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:52,159
perform

812
00:31:52,159 --> 00:31:54,720
or publish something about a specific

813
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:55,360
device

814
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:58,640
once it's implanted and that is a gap in

815
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:00,080
knowledge i mean we're

816
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:02,159
not going to know what the result is but

817
00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:03,279
at the same time

818
00:32:03,279 --> 00:32:05,120
you know the risk to a human in

819
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:07,679
performing the experiment

820
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:11,440
that's just not going to be acceptable

821
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:15,919
um let's see

822
00:32:15,919 --> 00:32:18,159
are they becoming more common um

823
00:32:18,159 --> 00:32:19,039
definitely

824
00:32:19,039 --> 00:32:21,120
i think um we were actually very

825
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:23,440
surprised how many of them

826
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:26,480
um had become available um they largely

827
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:28,000
are starting to address almost

828
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:31,200
every ailment i think the most common

829
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:32,000
ones you know

830
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:35,200
eyes ears some of those you know have

831
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:37,279
been around a long time it's more that

832
00:32:37,279 --> 00:32:37,840
we're now

833
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:40,240
connecting them to the internet so it's

834
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:41,200
like an iot

835
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:45,120
device uh living in your body and that's

836
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:48,159
the game changer that now makes the um

837
00:32:48,159 --> 00:32:50,559
kind of legacy policy from a national

838
00:32:50,559 --> 00:32:52,399
security perspective

839
00:32:52,399 --> 00:32:54,960
that's the big gap i think in trying to

840
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:56,080
plan

841
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:58,240
what technology will be five years from

842
00:32:58,240 --> 00:32:59,440
now not

843
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:03,120
what technology is today or looking back

844
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:06,399
the past five years uh

845
00:33:06,399 --> 00:33:08,880
question about doing uh are we

846
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:10,000
continuing to do work

847
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:13,440
on mitigations um we are yes um i think

848
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:16,000
it is a little more limited we're

849
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:16,640
looking at

850
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:19,679
other aspects of the security problem um

851
00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:22,240
and partially we will need to wait on

852
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:24,399
policy makers to engage and

853
00:33:24,399 --> 00:33:27,120
kind of decide how they want to address

854
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:27,679
because

855
00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:30,480
most of the policy restrictions it's

856
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:32,640
just a contention between

857
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:34,559
um you know the hr policy and the

858
00:33:34,559 --> 00:33:36,080
security policy

859
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:38,159
and i don't really think you can say one

860
00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:40,080
lens um

861
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:42,000
we're looking at it a little more from

862
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,279
the physics

863
00:33:43,279 --> 00:33:46,880
approach of how do i you know prevent it

864
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:48,880
from operating in the way that you know

865
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:50,720
it was intending without adding a lot of

866
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:53,840
risk to the user

867
00:33:55,519 --> 00:34:00,880
a question on imd having geolocation

868
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:02,640
one of the interesting ones we found

869
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:06,320
were the subcutaneous harp

870
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:09,679
monitors and they could actually call

871
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:12,879
at least one we found it i don't know if

872
00:34:12,879 --> 00:34:13,440
it

873
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:14,879
currently does it or at least they're

874
00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:16,639
proposing it um

875
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:18,639
able to call an ambulance when they

876
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:20,879
determine an irregularity

877
00:34:20,879 --> 00:34:22,960
so they were converting a geo location

878
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:24,480
to something that then

879
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:27,359
if it was network connected could help

880
00:34:27,359 --> 00:34:31,040
get a first responder to you pretty

881
00:34:32,839 --> 00:34:35,839
quickly

882
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:48,159
okay uh nyx surgeon looks like uh

883
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:50,960
question about skip compatible devices

884
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:53,679
not being compatible with fda

885
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:56,079
standards i think it's primarily an

886
00:34:56,079 --> 00:34:57,040
interest of

887
00:34:57,040 --> 00:35:00,320
focus it's a very

888
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:02,320
niche requirement you know trying to

889
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:03,599
prevent

890
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:05,920
any release or recording of data

891
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:07,599
especially when

892
00:35:07,599 --> 00:35:10,160
that recording is what makes the device

893
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:10,960
do its

894
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:14,240
function so i mean something like uh

895
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:17,520
one of the earplugs you know and i'm

896
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:19,599
trying to be able to record different

897
00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:21,440
sounds allow it to then

898
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:25,359
ship off that data to um a cloud-based

899
00:35:25,359 --> 00:35:27,359
processor and then report back and

900
00:35:27,359 --> 00:35:30,560
adjust the way that you receive it

901
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:33,680
it is going to be really hard when

902
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:35,680
you don't have control over what that

903
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:38,960
content is going back and forth

904
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:42,000
so i don't think um at least personally

905
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,359
i don't think fda is

906
00:35:43,359 --> 00:35:45,520
as concerned with that because they're

907
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:47,920
primarily looking at the

908
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:50,560
metadata content where theoretically all

909
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:53,119
that data is abstracted

910
00:35:53,119 --> 00:35:55,359
is it i don't know but we do know the

911
00:35:55,359 --> 00:35:56,720
data is being shipped off

912
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:59,760
so there's access to it in places that

913
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:01,680
from a security perspective we don't

914
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:12,880
want it to be let's see

915
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:16,160
so next up um

916
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:18,560
looks like jacob question about how the

917
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:21,280
devices communicate between themselves

918
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:24,240
um actually we didn't consider any

919
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:26,000
devices that talk from one

920
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:29,760
device to another device in the body

921
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:32,320
we were primarily considering a device

922
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:33,280
talking to an

923
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:36,480
external source so bluetooth being most

924
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:37,119
common

925
00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:39,280
you know the assumption is it's pairing

926
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:41,119
with any other device

927
00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:44,560
typically it's set up for a phone um

928
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:46,000
you know the fact that it can still

929
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,680
convey data and

930
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:51,040
you know it's not so important as to

931
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:54,320
what the individual data content is

932
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:59,200
that's where we were most concerned

933
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:06,880
okay a question about the standards for

934
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:09,920
deploying imds

935
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:13,119
i will admit i know far less about

936
00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:14,880
what the existing processes are

937
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:17,040
everybody we've talked to

938
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:19,040
we basically found that they were most

939
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:21,040
concerned with the

940
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:23,760
human safety aspect and the fact that if

941
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:24,480
the device

942
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:28,160
failed any of the smart components

943
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:31,119
that it would fail in a safe way so it

944
00:37:31,119 --> 00:37:32,240
may lose

945
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:35,200
communication but you know think of the

946
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:35,760
fact that

947
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:37,520
as long as it does its intended

948
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:39,040
operation for

949
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:42,640
the host um it hasn't failed in a

950
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:51,599
truly dangerous way

951
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:54,640
uh precedents about someone's health

952
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:56,879
um

953
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:01,520
yes um is there a concern about

954
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:04,480
legal liability jamming messing with the

955
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:05,440
software

956
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:09,040
i think there's a huge question

957
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:11,119
i mean i don't think any of the security

958
00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:12,720
officers want to

959
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:15,200
have that responsibility or liability i

960
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:16,320
mean either one

961
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:19,599
because an error quite simply means

962
00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:20,880
someone's health

963
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:23,839
um you know potentially their life um i

964
00:38:23,839 --> 00:38:25,520
think that's why we have to look at the

965
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:27,839
mitigations and we try to

966
00:38:27,839 --> 00:38:30,400
score them in at least a qualitative way

967
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:31,280
to say

968
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:33,359
you know as i'm moving up the scale

969
00:38:33,359 --> 00:38:35,200
where it's a higher impact

970
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:38,240
to the user higher risk that makes it

971
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:41,599
less desirable you know it may

972
00:38:41,599 --> 00:38:44,000
still be an option in some cases you

973
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,520
know maybe i do that for cochlear

974
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:47,599
implants or something where

975
00:38:47,599 --> 00:38:50,240
the failure isn't a you know

976
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:51,760
life-threatening one

977
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:53,760
um but you know kind of the genesis of

978
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:55,680
that is um that's what we do

979
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:58,800
with test equipment or other devices

980
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:02,079
that go into the facility so you know

981
00:39:02,079 --> 00:39:04,160
we're at least attempting to use

982
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:08,078
approaches that have been used before

983
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:14,000
okay uh last question it looks like

984
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,320
um question how long have i been in the

985
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:17,119
space

986
00:39:17,119 --> 00:39:20,160
um actually i'm not a medical

987
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:23,119
person by training um i'm a iot security

988
00:39:23,119 --> 00:39:24,079
person

989
00:39:24,079 --> 00:39:26,800
um so you know looking at communications

990
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:28,880
about 15 years

991
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:31,040
and since we're running out of time here

992
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:31,920
i'll

993
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:33,680
say thank you and if you have questions

994
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:35,760
contact info is in the slides

995
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:37,280
i look forward to talking with you

996
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:39,680
offline maybe not in between

997
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:42,160
sessions in the hallway but happy to

998
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:46,560
talk otherwise
