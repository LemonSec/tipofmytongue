1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:03,909
the session is I can't find the title

2
00:00:03,909 --> 00:00:09,840
which official standards

3
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:13,380
y control systems cyber security sucks
us define leaders

4
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:17,930
thank you very much I would have nothing
against

5
00:00:17,930 --> 00:00:22,750
reading here thanks for the invitation
in my previous life I was physicist

6
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:25,810
I move to control system engineering

7
00:00:25,810 --> 00:00:29,050
I was doing safety systems afterwards
and

8
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:32,930
poking around the safety systems I got
him the job offer security officer

9
00:00:32,930 --> 00:00:37,260
some I'm heading the security commits an
I'm usually I thought that title is why

10
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:39,230
control systems cyber security sucks

11
00:00:39,230 --> 00:00:43,329
but since you are putting the 25th year
anniversary of the WWW

12
00:00:43,329 --> 00:00:47,500
I'm I re maybe twice some control
systems cyber security

13
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:52,520
is big butt exciting so I would do in
the next hour 50 minutes

14
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:56,870
is is it 24 talk first to introduce
limit of Sun

15
00:00:56,870 --> 00:01:00,270
doing doing a small session about excite
the physics of an ass for that

16
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:05,420
and then I will def into our concerns or
problems with operations

17
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:09,020
in terms of control systems cyber
security so this is far away from rocket

18
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:09,610
science

19
00:01:09,610 --> 00:01:13,240
it is running actually run control
systems

20
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:17,100
the problems we've seen control system
which you cannot soul withstand i2

21
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:17,840
Technologies

22
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:21,110
usually what we're doing is we're
handling security issues on control

23
00:01:21,110 --> 00:01:22,509
systems like we do with core

24
00:01:22,509 --> 00:01:26,000
security issues IT systems and we do a
comparison between

25
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,470
computer centre security and control
systems cyber security and

26
00:01:29,470 --> 00:01:34,259
pinpoint down to three to four points
well I'm completely fed up because I

27
00:01:34,259 --> 00:01:36,079
cannot treat control systems

28
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:39,650
like a 12 2 Chron want to treat them
when they would have been

29
00:01:39,650 --> 00:01:40,770
I'm

30
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:44,520
computer centers so what a sense on its
European organisation for particle

31
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:45,429
physics

32
00:01:45,429 --> 00:01:49,450
I'm we're not European anymore nowadays
we are international into

33
00:01:49,450 --> 00:01:54,729
our main business very simple I'm this
is the area around genealogy both

34
00:01:54,729 --> 00:01:57,929
on the right hand side you see the
Geneva Airport we have some comments on

35
00:01:57,929 --> 00:02:00,610
the ground the large ones 27 committed
in circumference

36
00:02:00,610 --> 00:02:04,619
and what we do is we take protons
problems are Wallace all over place

37
00:02:04,619 --> 00:02:08,500
we take two protons reply to put on some
clothes protons we can look at

38
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:12,780
deep back into this into time something
like 1,000,000,000 for the second

39
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:16,519
after the Big Bang and Teresa lately
said to be the conditions which were

40
00:02:16,519 --> 00:02:17,400
happening at the time

41
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:21,510
we take photos of those once we got some
digital cameras and details talking like

42
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:21,880
this

43
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:25,799
you stop the photos you put the portents
into punches the punches you put into

44
00:02:25,799 --> 00:02:26,420
beams

45
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:30,489
so I each of the penis 1,380 punches I'm

46
00:02:30,489 --> 00:02:33,930
you put them into some kinda wynette if
you come from a big city this was

47
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:36,739
looking like the public transport no
public transport is the same thing

48
00:02:36,739 --> 00:02:39,970
you stop somewhere the beginning I'm you
see it here link on

49
00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:45,079
Lina to other so work today a process we
start next week in part because

50
00:02:45,079 --> 00:02:48,230
with different types of tax returns for
the protons are X-rated here

51
00:02:48,230 --> 00:02:52,590
first yes second Kia that Kia fourth
gear

52
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:56,090
and once you for picking up to possibly
thing to something larger which the

53
00:02:56,090 --> 00:02:57,130
Large Hadron Collider

54
00:02:57,130 --> 00:03:00,329
this the 27 commit along accelerator
which

55
00:03:00,329 --> 00:03:03,480
which is hosting the beams in the center
of this push to

56
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:08,569
so you can see the two beams p.m. so
marked in blue and red but usually they

57
00:03:08,569 --> 00:03:09,380
don't have any color

58
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:13,579
their separate to the size of the beam
is as big a spin on the one euro coin

59
00:03:13,579 --> 00:03:17,920
I'm saw him I don't have a nervous in
New York on it so I put a picture here

60
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:21,530
the problem with the beams there is
something that's why we need to have

61
00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:21,920
lots not

62
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:25,639
safety systems local control systems the
energy of the bean

63
00:03:25,639 --> 00:03:31,019
is Eklund eighty kilograms of TNT this
segment to the energy of a Boeing 747

64
00:03:31,019 --> 00:03:32,630
fully loaded when it's starting

65
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:36,079
but all been as a size 0 for millimeters
all the size of Spain

66
00:03:36,079 --> 00:03:39,780
this beam is getting lost with on our
actuator we destroy the accelerator

67
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:42,790
be destroyed much im because it's like a
lady like a lady says

68
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:46,290
saber of Star Wars cutting open a lax
writer

69
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:49,769
and then the beam is more less about
breaking into the time three-time

70
00:03:49,769 --> 00:03:52,720
national safety systems control systems
which are monitoring the puppy was

71
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:53,980
exactly was staying with

72
00:03:53,980 --> 00:04:00,110
to be inside the machine but not outside
for taking the pictures we have to come

73
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:02,390
across this one of the digit cameras
which just know what

74
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:05,890
from surface to air to the cabin level
which 1i meters underground

75
00:04:05,890 --> 00:04:09,879
this another one you can see one of my
colleague standing on the platform

76
00:04:09,879 --> 00:04:13,580
just give you an idea of the size the
length of the scum rose 43 meters

77
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:17,790
by me just 26 meters and to his mother
picture you can see where the two beams

78
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:18,810
are supposed to go

79
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:22,079
here the beams are led in 1 p.m. type
because we have to establish the

80
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:22,610
collisions

81
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:26,520
in the center of the digital camera once
the the interesting part

82
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:29,669
it's like in the 5500 I'm

83
00:04:29,669 --> 00:04:32,889
it's pouring into the collisions so
collisions are looking like this

84
00:04:32,889 --> 00:04:36,410
this when a ship collision we can
produce something like forty million

85
00:04:36,410 --> 00:04:38,979
conditions a second which means that the
cameras are taking

86
00:04:38,979 --> 00:04:42,220
forty million pictures the second this
is one of the pictures

87
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:45,520
and this another picture it's like like
a car accident

88
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:48,600
just take it as a car accident you can
now take everything here

89
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:52,039
can nope lead everything back and figure
out what happened at the time of the

90
00:04:52,039 --> 00:04:52,550
collision

91
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:55,660
so what weather conditions when the
collision were happening and this gives

92
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:57,139
you more or less the simulation

93
00:04:57,139 --> 00:05:01,310
what happened at the Big Bang time 30
million million and $30 billion years

94
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:05,690
ago as a set we taking something like go

95
00:05:05,690 --> 00:05:09,710
forty million pick just a second we
process them know another computer

96
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:12,280
center but which is not big enough to
stall the data

97
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:16,310
so the data is distributed over some
like 150 computer centers worldwide

98
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:21,080
the data rates were taking per year some
like 20 petabyte 225 petabytes the raw

99
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:22,539
data rate in the collision

100
00:05:22,539 --> 00:05:25,620
is something like one picked up by per
second which you cannot store so we have

101
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:27,610
to be selectively not taking every photo

102
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:31,810
will be taking every $1 million 422 to
start this week so in the end

103
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:35,760
and this is processed and the processor
properly in a good physicist

104
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:39,520
at any given nobel prize which was about
to air have

105
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:46,360
to Peter hates his colleague in 2012
just look at this

106
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:48,949
running XO regis running experiments

107
00:05:48,949 --> 00:05:53,150
needs lots and lots of control systems
here the list of control so I won't go

108
00:05:53,150 --> 00:05:55,009
into the details but we need to compose

109
00:05:55,009 --> 00:05:58,020
electricity for progenics for data
taking so long

110
00:05:58,020 --> 00:06:01,419
salsa pashley control systems being
developed it so I'm

111
00:06:01,419 --> 00:06:04,620
mostly their control system which just
brought ministry

112
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:07,979
because in the end of his one is no
different than the producing cars

113
00:06:07,979 --> 00:06:08,840
reproducing

114
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:12,259
pictures of collisions of protons and we
said this to physicist

115
00:06:12,259 --> 00:06:16,500
so here the control system running this
is a it's a control system for

116
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:19,889
energy distribution we gotta control
says for gas distribution control

117
00:06:19,889 --> 00:06:20,560
systems

118
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:24,850
for micro Genix pumping BIOS and control
system for safety

119
00:06:24,850 --> 00:06:28,539
your control system for access control
so you wanna go in

120
00:06:28,539 --> 00:06:32,930
you need to have go to work with certain
sauce and to get access to the exciter

121
00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:36,729
this requires an iris scan of your I
just make sure that you are you

122
00:06:36,729 --> 00:06:40,410
and we could control rooms with all the
Synaptics all the panels

123
00:06:40,410 --> 00:06:44,020
to see

124
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:48,410
the plenty of control system sets on and
was pissing me off

125
00:06:48,410 --> 00:06:52,419
when we started investigating of control
system was that the security footprint

126
00:06:52,419 --> 00:06:53,690
of those control systems

127
00:06:53,690 --> 00:06:57,630
when on existing when I started doing
safety systems

128
00:06:57,630 --> 00:07:01,479
I was able to predict my safety system
the safety system you can take that one

129
00:07:01,479 --> 00:07:03,139
is the optimum my safety system

130
00:07:03,139 --> 00:07:06,690
was the availability was there like you
that the safety system is failing

131
00:07:06,690 --> 00:07:11,300
so I was making those cake nation but I
was able to finish my conclusion because

132
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:12,270
all the control system

133
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:16,349
I was calculating on at all meeting at
Port and it was awesome question what

134
00:07:16,349 --> 00:07:17,199
does somebody like

135
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:22,180
you are hacking into my control system
and this was 2004 was able to answer

136
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:23,139
this question to me

137
00:07:23,139 --> 00:07:26,520
so I was given the mandate to
investigate people we did some some some

138
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:28,570
more testing and every system attested

139
00:07:28,570 --> 00:07:31,840
every commercial system attested was
showing some floors

140
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:35,120
this when I started thinking that
control systems have secured is

141
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:35,669
completely

142
00:07:35,669 --> 00:07:40,150
vacant exciting welcome picking stocks
so why should you worry

143
00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:44,690
I don't know I've collected the a couple
of snapshots from from the media

144
00:07:44,690 --> 00:07:49,030
then let's not submit snapshot some of
them are true some of them might not be

145
00:07:49,030 --> 00:07:49,590
true

146
00:07:49,590 --> 00:07:54,690
icon judge I know at least that one is
completely untrue which is the one which

147
00:07:54,690 --> 00:07:55,620
is appearing aa

148
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:59,550
Wallace now have justifies the face
nearly seaside

149
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:03,360
and came close to switching off the year
the particle detector

150
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:07,610
and this was far from the truth but damn
somebody what if I single-page

151
00:08:07,610 --> 00:08:13,800
but if you look at this I think the
basic questions which were facing is

152
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:18,760
we have a problem do you think we have a
problem

153
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:22,479
so what nobody is carrying

154
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:28,210
what I see is lots lots of talk about
control systems cyber security

155
00:08:28,210 --> 00:08:33,099
I see that some Big Ben this acting
motor control system I'm buying

156
00:08:33,099 --> 00:08:36,260
on small vendors and every time looking
at the control system

157
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:39,760
I see the security footprint of those
small control systems

158
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:43,349
a completely non existing what I mean is
very simple

159
00:08:43,349 --> 00:08:47,760
you control system like those too the
first one is a doozy meter reader

160
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:51,660
this does it is a small monitoring
device which you carry on your body

161
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:55,300
when you go into the panel's and every
month have to check under the box you

162
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:56,750
put those meat into the box

163
00:08:56,750 --> 00:09:01,430
and it's freezing your your monthly does
32 the penetration testing on this

164
00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:02,060
device

165
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:05,150
action wasn't really penetration testing
because of the thirty seconds the

166
00:09:05,150 --> 00:09:06,450
confession testing was done

167
00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:11,310
what I'm doing with my team is

168
00:09:11,310 --> 00:09:14,779
we get a small red team go team exercise
from

169
00:09:14,779 --> 00:09:18,000
if somebody might he managed to get the
root password of the device

170
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,940
I only eaten a bottle of wine someone
managed to end since 2000 and up on the

171
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:23,580
device

172
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:27,120
I own the crate of wine why and not just
to prove that you can install something

173
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,300
completely different on the five

174
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:32,070
which you shouldn't be able to in the
first case I lost a bottle of wine

175
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:36,290
the guy who tested the device was more
or less than dumping the call ok in the

176
00:09:36,290 --> 00:09:36,860
device

177
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:41,000
extracting the cord on where TFTP
analyst analyzing the TFTP called

178
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,470
company found the root password

179
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:46,820
for the 10 access this was thirty
seconds of course you spoke to the

180
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:47,300
vendor

181
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:52,209
and then the promise to fix this the
second advising on trusting the supposed

182
00:09:52,209 --> 00:09:55,070
supply which museum thousands of those
power supplies

183
00:09:55,070 --> 00:09:58,089
for control systems you can see on the
back

184
00:09:58,089 --> 00:10:02,190
therefore you finna ports one actually
is a really thin a port to connect this

185
00:10:02,190 --> 00:10:02,720
one

186
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:06,580
and you do not have service attack for
70 seconds just from them

187
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:10,440
just sending random garbage to the
Ethernet port the device is dead

188
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:13,960
dead in terms of you cannot control it
anymore you still have the power

189
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:17,550
sister left with wats nine boys three
boys months he was and so on

190
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:22,010
but you cannot control the piney more go
anyway how to reset the device

191
00:10:22,010 --> 00:10:26,250
is you pull the plug can you think a
long it takes to not mine

192
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:30,080
to run around Sun side to kill the plug
1000 defies

193
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:33,690
in case something like that is happening
this we're taking a fortune of time

194
00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:37,340
so what we've seen is that the control
system has been tested

195
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:41,030
they forcing use cases controlling
something

196
00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:44,860
guaranteeing the safety or something but
once you look a little bit different on

197
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:47,890
the devices with easy to woods and this
is not something of a sophisticated

198
00:10:47,890 --> 00:10:48,760
stuff

199
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:52,210
i've seen earlier today this is
something very very plain no ending

200
00:10:52,210 --> 00:10:52,820
fruits

201
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:58,240
basic stuff the devices start to failing
security at least from my perspective

202
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:02,020
on the controls i've seen is not
integral part

203
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:05,760
of the overall sometimes they do
something through security

204
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:09,070
like in some protocols that the vendors
in principle

205
00:11:09,070 --> 00:11:12,210
saying the the the communications
encrypt it but it looks

206
00:11:12,210 --> 00:11:16,160
deeper in you figure other this just
lived of shape is shifting of XIII ski

207
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:16,610
coat

208
00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:21,310
three test and control systems we took
our control systems we did something

209
00:11:21,310 --> 00:11:22,190
very simple

210
00:11:22,190 --> 00:11:26,620
just took Nessus and the five necessary
to control system

211
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:30,660
this is not rocket science everybody if
you guys can do but if you see the

212
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:31,380
outcome

213
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:35,970
this is just shocking devices will you
send a pic is saying I'm IP version 5 in

214
00:11:35,970 --> 00:11:38,120
the devices starting blinking red and
yellow

215
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:41,480
retirement security anymore we come
under bust this

216
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:44,770
resilience this is completely insane

217
00:11:44,770 --> 00:11:49,230
three-test levi's a 17 percent of the
device 2:53 bus have been tested in 2000

218
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:49,480
and

219
00:11:49,470 --> 00:11:54,220
and seven 17 devices were completely
staining

220
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:57,790
which means that they are you sending up
actually Christian Christmas tree attack

221
00:11:57,790 --> 00:11:58,190
or

222
00:11:58,190 --> 00:12:02,450
i Commission 5 whatever's and device is
dead

223
00:12:02,450 --> 00:12:06,830
the control processes to pumping you
still able to control something

224
00:12:06,830 --> 00:12:10,260
but all the network on occasion have
seized the LED's a blinking red or

225
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:10,760
yellow

226
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:15,070
network on occasion is dead which means
now the process cannot talk

227
00:12:15,070 --> 00:12:19,160
anymore the other processes into
communications completely seized

228
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:23,180
so I have to go around and we should all
those devices it'll appear sees

229
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:27,920
embedded devices how to use and so on
fifty percent of the devices didn't pay

230
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:29,680
completely but they failed somehow

231
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:32,860
devices running 10 added you send them
at ten a password of

232
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:36,500
4000 characters buffer overflow 10 it is
dead

233
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:39,870
same with the web server web server you
a lot 8,000 characters

234
00:12:39,870 --> 00:12:43,030
web servers dead is this supposed to be
like this

235
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:47,400
I have my doubts but I'm looking forward
is why don't we have a certification

236
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:48,900
scheme for those devices

237
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:52,520
why can't nobody came up with a list of
to its

238
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:56,850
easy to woods write them on the paper
and saying you have to test this year on

239
00:12:56,850 --> 00:12:57,390
this

240
00:12:57,390 --> 00:13:00,460
this tool this to invest with this too
if the outcome here

241
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:04,580
is a the device is fine if the outcome
is be the revised is

242
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:08,000
flawed just a stuffed with something
very basic

243
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,640
use necessary from its but whatever as I
don't care but the list

244
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:16,160
they also the vacation schemes in the
word which you can buy you can buy in

245
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:19,890
and you can certify devices for fortune
of money but most other than that I'm

246
00:13:19,890 --> 00:13:20,580
talking to

247
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:23,590
they don't have a fortune of money so I
would like to give them a small

248
00:13:23,590 --> 00:13:24,750
procedure recipe

249
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:28,670
run this tour on that tour and that went
if the outcome is ABCD

250
00:13:28,670 --> 00:13:32,070
your devices at least for that moment
for this particular recipe

251
00:13:32,070 --> 00:13:35,620
at that particular date considered to be
robust resilient enough

252
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:38,950
and the good thing is the vendor can do
the test

253
00:13:38,950 --> 00:13:43,310
but I can also the test at home so if
he's telling me my device passed the

254
00:13:43,310 --> 00:13:44,470
test I can verify

255
00:13:44,470 --> 00:13:48,810
whether he's telling the truth or not
all I can give the test to a third party

256
00:13:48,810 --> 00:13:52,000
and third party can make money like a
nice for 9000 certification

257
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,110
running the same test but unfortunately
is not existing

258
00:13:55,110 --> 00:13:58,210
there is no open public security
certification get

259
00:13:58,210 --> 00:14:02,580
I'm looking forward there lots lots of
people thinking on cool big scale test

260
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:03,100
stands

261
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:06,820
which has another use case was also good
but I'm still looking at the basics

262
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:11,230
defense in depth is starting with the
fundamentals and fundamentals are

263
00:14:11,230 --> 00:14:14,670
robust devices and what I see is the
device

264
00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:18,300
i'm looking at I'm not robust they
completely shocking if you just say hey

265
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:20,850
I'm I P bush in five the device is going
into the knees

266
00:14:20,850 --> 00:14:26,230
and this is not something we should
happen we can talk about lost

267
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:30,020
I i think is the US you can be happy
that there's one law if I'm not mistaken

268
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:33,990
and you're a blast to them negotiating
for the next twenty years on the law's

269
00:14:33,990 --> 00:14:38,540
I'm I feel that that too many guidelines
there's a couple for your guidance for

270
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:40,380
print them out I think it's able to meet
this

271
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:44,430
and i Justi 21 guidelines so please do
not produce more guidelines I'm done

272
00:14:44,430 --> 00:14:47,800
and then there's an unwillingness to
share incidents this is something which

273
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:48,680
is not moving

274
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:52,010
but I still if I talk to them that we
communicated I was on a bill it is to

275
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:52,860
some other vendors

276
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:56,340
I'm they say apps but don't tell anybody
because they fear

277
00:14:56,340 --> 00:14:59,500
it's fun because they fear that

278
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:02,640
somebody edge by the misuse the
inability for something so responsible

279
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:03,340
disclosure

280
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:07,390
is not existing this we on it was nice
to have a computer center

281
00:15:07,390 --> 00:15:12,080
computers and I got a computer center
10007 I can run penetration testing up

282
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:13,620
and down as long as I want to

283
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:17,450
I do not pay my sisters my face systems
might fail but there are a ton

284
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:22,030
some other system a takeover and we got
decades of experience knowledge

285
00:15:22,030 --> 00:15:25,720
in terms of security so what we're doing
now also the control system Sat Sun

286
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:28,850
you're scanning them for taking the
Burnaby joining

287
00:15:28,850 --> 00:15:32,320
and maps comes again the control system
on our life in operation systems

288
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:36,660
sometimes some other assistance might
fail but if the system failed to detect

289
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:37,810
that they feared

290
00:15:37,810 --> 00:15:41,670
we can replace them and make the whole
overall system more resilient and

291
00:15:41,670 --> 00:15:44,850
before my big question is

292
00:15:44,850 --> 00:15:49,290
why do I have to be a the costs of

293
00:15:49,290 --> 00:15:52,480
all this what you have to do due
diligence

294
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:57,350
and set up the when this which shipping
insecure applications

295
00:15:57,350 --> 00:16:01,170
on devices question mark hope this

296
00:16:01,170 --> 00:16:04,760
we can keep for later for discussion but
interests and opinions

297
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:08,130
at the moment is something what has been
said this morning that religion and this

298
00:16:08,130 --> 00:16:08,740
software

299
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:12,520
at the moment all the costs of me so I
have to do defense and DEP

300
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:15,800
I have to do the one going to scanning
and I have to bother when the device

301
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:20,020
is not robust so I have to say to the
vendor your device not robust

302
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:23,840
what is your new new product can i buy
that I cannot just return and saying

303
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:30,320
not secure enough I give it back the
next problem I'm facing with the

304
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:30,980
patching

305
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:34,560
this is a screenshot of an FTP I wake up
screaming

306
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:38,550
where somebody managed to hack into 300
devices which occur

307
00:16:38,550 --> 00:16:44,790
to office network saying that though
he's alone and that is offering the 6

308
00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:46,530
gigabytes of hard disk around

309
00:16:46,530 --> 00:16:50,250
if you look deeper difficult this is not
a computer

310
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:55,430
this is an oscilloscope if you haven't
seen on a Cisco been also scored

311
00:16:55,430 --> 00:16:56,170
nowadays

312
00:16:56,170 --> 00:16:59,900
to buy one from the crowd Tektronix HP
and whatever also PCs

313
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:04,160
with some dedicated hardware lots of
knobs but them see you can't even move

314
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:07,760
where you see the blue screen of death
if you move into the connie has to the

315
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:08,430
stop button

316
00:17:08,430 --> 00:17:12,120
our engineers at that moment in time did
know that they were running Windows XP

317
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:13,110
devices

318
00:17:13,110 --> 00:17:17,320
so nothing got that how many device to
run Windows XP and you don't even know

319
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:21,140
about this we got a couple of us let's
go to get several dozens of a Cisco to

320
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:23,390
running Windows XP know it is also in
the seven

321
00:17:23,390 --> 00:17:26,990
and we have a problem because now they
have to be patched here we didn't even

322
00:17:26,990 --> 00:17:29,540
know all the engineers didn't know that
they can patch the device

323
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:33,490
so I'm the usual argument why you can
approach it

324
00:17:33,490 --> 00:17:37,380
is you need to make compliance testing

325
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:42,130
if you all tell you control system which
has been sold to you by your vendor

326
00:17:42,130 --> 00:17:47,100
then you lose any guarantees any any
certification anything as you have to

327
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:48,080
reset it to his

328
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:51,110
recertifying control system if your
safety system

329
00:17:51,110 --> 00:17:55,880
me too I keep you current is Uni reaches
you need to recertify you safety system

330
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:59,570
that it's still safe enough that he can
run it but this was only for a very

331
00:17:59,570 --> 00:18:01,020
small fraction of

332
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:04,510
control systems for scope I don't care

333
00:18:04,510 --> 00:18:08,300
the school doesn't need to recertify I'm
thinking of the school has a PC with

334
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:09,379
some dedicated software

335
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:13,620
and some dedicated mother and how to
report and then the next from

336
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:14,950
approaching is there a row

337
00:18:14,950 --> 00:18:18,630
maintenance windows you cannot just
patch a control system

338
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:22,460
when your production site and you have
to wait for cap when your maintenance

339
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:27,090
maintenance mode single clue how blue is
done glue is done in the big celinda

340
00:18:27,090 --> 00:18:30,370
as long as the slimmest turning you glue
is staying fluid

341
00:18:30,370 --> 00:18:33,750
if the slimness stopping you do is
heartening out and you can for

342
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:37,360
four-way the also into know you think
the whole thing is is no

343
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:41,550
driven by a small Windows PC when do you
think can reap with the Windows PC dual

344
00:18:41,550 --> 00:18:43,270
to you did

345
00:18:43,270 --> 00:18:45,460
have questioned on because you use your
product

346
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:49,130
and the same thing is happening it's
under control systems which %uh slow

347
00:18:49,130 --> 00:18:53,590
gas distribution kooning imagination
water distribution

348
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:56,840
also snow systems if you shut down our
control part

349
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:59,870
Linux server reboot and Observer
Reporter Windows Server

350
00:18:59,870 --> 00:19:03,360
you can easily to began other systems
which are much more critical Japan

351
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:04,720
critical that you report them

352
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:07,780
you lose your process you have to wait
until you get the maintenance period we

353
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:08,510
have every six

354
00:19:08,510 --> 00:19:11,720
Mundus every six weeks making period we
can apply patches

355
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:15,660
and I we faced with local legacy a
better devices

356
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:19,100
which you cannot patch because there's
nothing to patching more nobody provide

357
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:20,530
to the most most recent

358
00:19:20,530 --> 00:19:24,530
I upgrades so now you have to fence
around it apply your defense and up

359
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:28,340
but also only arguments more this coming
by the vendors

360
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:33,050
the main argument I'm facing is my
control suspension is appearing to break

361
00:19:33,050 --> 00:19:35,000
it defies which cost than $100 million

362
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:40,250
1000 Swiss francs do you dare think
often use call you by body in your car

363
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:44,660
50,000 box and now the van is saying yes
you can apply know this patch but if the

364
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:45,540
patch is failing

365
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:48,590
the responsibility and the bed like just
a few

366
00:19:48,590 --> 00:19:53,830
the same thing here such an oscilloscope
you can easily cost 100,000 Swiss francs

367
00:19:53,830 --> 00:19:54,600
1000

368
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:59,650
dollars snow my control suspension is a
very reluctant to apply a patch because

369
00:19:59,650 --> 00:20:00,260
I'm

370
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:03,950
most of the cases the patches can be
applied if it's paving

371
00:20:03,950 --> 00:20:07,870
and then he has a 10 thousand doughnut
break sitting in his lap

372
00:20:07,870 --> 00:20:10,910
who is taking all liability was taking
the cost

373
00:20:10,910 --> 00:20:15,370
is the security team because I'm forcing
into patch is at him and he's not taking

374
00:20:15,370 --> 00:20:15,760
the

375
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:19,050
the responsibility or should I go back
to the bend and ask the vendor

376
00:20:19,050 --> 00:20:23,200
whether he can fix the problem at the
moment you really doing this this and

377
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,370
this exercise

378
00:20:24,370 --> 00:20:28,120
because we have a couple of Windows XP
devices and would like to upgrade them

379
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:28,920
2007

380
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:32,650
when is excused absence I have two would
win the seven the cost up to devise a

381
00:20:32,650 --> 00:20:34,940
bit between 3,000 and 10,000 Swiss
francs

382
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:38,960
just upgrading from Windows XP to
Windows 7 completely insane

383
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:43,680
and much less less expensive than buying
new device if another computer center

384
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:48,730
this is completely different when hubby
came out it took me 20 to get some like

385
00:20:48,730 --> 00:20:49,430
two hours

386
00:20:49,430 --> 00:20:53,020
to catch all the service facing the
Internet actually not me but the guys

387
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:54,440
will maintain the computer center

388
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:56,370
two hours

389
00:20:56,370 --> 00:20:58,940
to fix everything else 24 hours

390
00:20:58,940 --> 00:21:02,080
if I need to reinstall the cast of 7,000
notes

391
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:05,410
48 hours with grace periods to tell the
physicist

392
00:21:05,410 --> 00:21:08,880
that the calculations jobs a kid and
rebooting the service

393
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:12,590
I can to foster but then we will use
efficiency because they're killing

394
00:21:12,590 --> 00:21:16,200
actually analyzes job so the physicist
we don't want don't want to kill them

395
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:16,890
less jobs

396
00:21:16,890 --> 00:21:21,270
to you what you do is to announce that
the so the custom we go down

397
00:21:21,270 --> 00:21:25,030
you stop accusing nobody can submit new
calculation jumps into the computer

398
00:21:25,030 --> 00:21:25,630
center

399
00:21:25,630 --> 00:21:28,830
and the new aid into the QB calculations
of the dropping out which is usually

400
00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:30,370
between 24-48 hours

401
00:21:30,370 --> 00:21:34,280
if you do the idea after 12 hours to
kill the jobs and then you re reboot

402
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:39,270
possible we had times where we Reese
reinstalling 7,000 notes a quickie

403
00:21:39,270 --> 00:21:42,920
because someone ability which came out a
couple months before Andrew ensure will

404
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:44,560
be completely sick where we were

405
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:47,760
completely secure on the computer center
why can we do this

406
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:50,850
because the computer center we have a
full configuration management

407
00:21:50,850 --> 00:21:55,750
in the computer center we have suffered
enough life cycles get regression

408
00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:56,330
testing

409
00:21:56,330 --> 00:21:59,440
we get nightly builds we virtualization

410
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:04,610
and you for redundancy and we try to
keep the numbers have sex exceptions the

411
00:22:04,610 --> 00:22:06,130
computers and as low as

412
00:22:06,130 --> 00:22:10,240
as possible every exception is a killer
this at least what I love my job a

413
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:11,170
security officer

414
00:22:11,170 --> 00:22:15,540
everything was homogeneous heterogeneous
was when maintain centrally

415
00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:19,580
I can easily generate I can easily
handle but then taking all the small

416
00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:20,340
exhibition

417
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:24,400
a.m. exceptions here and there they're
costing me my time

418
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:27,860
20 trying now to trying to run or
control systems

419
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:32,110
excellent to the computer center having
something about cited behind

420
00:22:32,110 --> 00:22:35,800
making Russian testing making nightly
builds and trying to reinstall the

421
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:37,490
service also a regular basis

422
00:22:37,490 --> 00:22:40,530
just to show that we can but still a
long way

423
00:22:40,530 --> 00:22:44,540
and I things getting worse

424
00:22:44,540 --> 00:22:49,040
with an Internet of Things thinking of
the fridge

425
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:51,509
think my call

426
00:22:51,509 --> 00:22:55,429
my wii my television mice might be to

427
00:22:55,429 --> 00:22:59,039
the smoke sensor and everything as I got
my house

428
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:02,860
now in the future everything is running
with some firmware everything is

429
00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:04,519
vulnerable because by default

430
00:23:04,519 --> 00:23:07,950
it is wrong to how do you do with the
patching we want to patch

431
00:23:07,950 --> 00:23:11,149
a replacement television every every six
months because I am

432
00:23:11,149 --> 00:23:14,440
there's something more secure coming out
there's another discussion

433
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:17,539
discussion I don't have a question and I
don't have an answer to this one but I

434
00:23:17,539 --> 00:23:19,159
believe patching must be prompt

435
00:23:19,159 --> 00:23:23,499
and agile for control system the same
thing must hold

436
00:23:23,499 --> 00:23:27,230
to see some other control systems

437
00:23:27,230 --> 00:23:30,289
this that the top picture this is a

438
00:23:30,289 --> 00:23:34,359
a.m. on the computer I think this is a
cop comes

439
00:23:34,359 --> 00:23:38,379
a system and you can see on the screen
the ex so you can get snow which

440
00:23:38,379 --> 00:23:39,619
operating system it's running

441
00:23:39,619 --> 00:23:44,619
we'll all this is a a big laser cutter
which is running Windows XP if you could

442
00:23:44,619 --> 00:23:48,960
zoom into the screen can see this stuff
but not Windows XP both devices cost you

443
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:49,820
1 million

444
00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:53,109
Swiss franc savalas we depend on both
devices

445
00:23:53,109 --> 00:23:56,539
most devices are all what from external
company

446
00:23:56,539 --> 00:23:59,669
so those external companies like to
service the devices

447
00:23:59,669 --> 00:24:03,679
for servicing the devices they don't
want to come in because coming in means

448
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:04,919
they have to travel to San

449
00:24:04,919 --> 00:24:08,009
which might take them 24 hours than they
need to do the repairs

450
00:24:08,009 --> 00:24:11,149
many to move up again for 24 hours so
this will cost a fortune

451
00:24:11,149 --> 00:24:14,299
they are asking for remote access so
somebody know of

452
00:24:14,299 --> 00:24:17,399
mean why do your control says need to
have remote access

453
00:24:17,399 --> 00:24:23,429
this is expected argument why suppliers
need a back seat to the devices

454
00:24:23,429 --> 00:24:25,940
and then they don't have even one
solution every supply has its own

455
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:26,629
solution

456
00:24:26,629 --> 00:24:30,499
TeamViewer nephew were BP and then

457
00:24:30,499 --> 00:24:33,769
VMC VMC oh SH Citrix whatever

458
00:24:33,769 --> 00:24:39,139
as than the sis's committee for
passwords and

459
00:24:39,139 --> 00:24:42,580
undocumented effect also and they don't
have integrated power

460
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:46,029
macy s access control on those devices
just a pain

461
00:24:46,029 --> 00:24:49,669
who s thing i've seen

462
00:24:49,669 --> 00:24:53,909
I don't even know whether I should laugh
or not is some other control systems

463
00:24:53,909 --> 00:24:54,690
require

464
00:24:54,690 --> 00:24:59,470
to have a license at startup and the
option given to us

465
00:24:59,470 --> 00:25:02,670
by the software vendor was

466
00:25:02,670 --> 00:25:04,570
you need to contact well home station

467
00:25:04,570 --> 00:25:09,640
someone the US Sony just admission a
line of sight between my control systems

468
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:14,020
behind some various talking directly to
a server somewhere in the US

469
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:18,820
just for activating my control system
this doesn't feel right at all

470
00:25:18,820 --> 00:25:23,180
a computer center

471
00:25:23,180 --> 00:25:27,030
yes oh computer centers open because
it's serving a worldwide community

472
00:25:27,030 --> 00:25:31,140
but then we get all the nitty-gritty of
the pieces of

473
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:34,820
access control single sign-on it up
Active Directory multi-factor

474
00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:36,630
authentication certificates

475
00:25:36,630 --> 00:25:40,100
cameras and there were even looking at
the Federation

476
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:43,130
future so know if you think of

477
00:25:43,130 --> 00:25:49,210
the ad Cup the ACA is amiss I think even
if I was a myth nowadays

478
00:25:49,210 --> 00:25:52,470
and it's hard to maintain I think we
should strive to having

479
00:25:52,470 --> 00:25:56,720
more robust is more resilience each of
the levels in particular the control

480
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:57,290
system

481
00:25:57,290 --> 00:26:01,100
I'm not completely sure that we have
this today I'm not in computer sure

482
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:05,940
well we have this next five years the
last

483
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:09,060
think I would like to discuss

484
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:15,860
is education if you look at the CV's of
my students and getting students are

485
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:17,260
getting a pic phone every year

486
00:26:17,260 --> 00:26:22,020
of some %uh students have taken students
working at certain something 400 to 500

487
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:22,620
students

488
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:27,270
also the kids tho so I kids which I'll
program issues in the future

489
00:26:27,270 --> 00:26:31,890
but if you look at the CBS I'm wondering
whether security is taught in the city

490
00:26:31,890 --> 00:26:35,010
if you look at them they got a Bachelor

491
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:38,020
good got a Bachelor bachelor in computer
science

492
00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:42,060
so they learned about databases

493
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:45,520
operating system programming setting up
a web server

494
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:49,800
brilliant this is what a computer CA
computer engineer supposed to do

495
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:54,340
but many of the security and if you go
out no security is not part of my

496
00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:54,930
bachelor

497
00:26:54,930 --> 00:27:01,220
security I do went to the master this
again doesn't feel right

498
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:05,820
I think security must be more embedded
in the overall going to have no

499
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:06,440
profanity

500
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:12,040
professionalism on that play a direct
control system engineering

501
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:16,470
most in the control suspension is i
seein look in this EP

502
00:27:16,470 --> 00:27:19,690
they believe they have ideas about it.
technologies

503
00:27:19,690 --> 00:27:23,460
but this not part of their curriculum
they don't learn computer engineering

504
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:27,730
they learn control system engineering so
they don't know actually how to set up a

505
00:27:27,730 --> 00:27:28,300
network

506
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:32,210
but they train themselves when they on
the job they don't know how to patching

507
00:27:32,210 --> 00:27:33,350
so they just %uh forget about

508
00:27:33,350 --> 00:27:37,260
watching man they'd doing reinvention of
the

509
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:40,680
of something I T instead they should
embrace it. technologies

510
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:44,090
so all control system outage from the
design are using

511
00:27:44,090 --> 00:27:47,990
GetJar all the standard IT technologies
just to make it more homogeneous

512
00:27:47,990 --> 00:27:51,540
what you trying is he trying to bring
together the controls when that he would

513
00:27:51,540 --> 00:27:56,310
just having the same paradigm from both
sides but is it a lot of time because

514
00:27:56,310 --> 00:28:00,780
if you do with people changing minds of
people is very very hard

515
00:28:00,780 --> 00:28:04,600
if you want to convince somebody I just
a suggest to you this book

516
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:08,760
who moved my cheese it's about the
reluctance of

517
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:14,560
Shulman's for change how quick are you
changing how quickly can you move from

518
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:15,770
one city to another

519
00:28:15,770 --> 00:28:20,060
how quickly can you move your job the
young nothing easy at all do you getting

520
00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:23,690
the more resistant to all I got some
people in particular physicist was to

521
00:28:23,690 --> 00:28:24,930
programming Kobal

522
00:28:24,930 --> 00:28:28,080
pasquale a basic because this is what
they did when they were young

523
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:31,080
nowadays they're not forced to move to
some more modern tech nerd

524
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:36,120
programming languages so they don't do
sushi again we are

525
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:39,210
why security

526
00:28:39,210 --> 00:28:42,550
still separated from maintainability

527
00:28:42,550 --> 00:28:45,880
functionality usability and a visibility

528
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:49,790
why do have a security conference I've
never seen availability conference

529
00:28:49,790 --> 00:28:53,560
of functionality conference this is
something which comes out too much when

530
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:54,580
you write your software

531
00:28:54,580 --> 00:28:57,900
it has some perchance have to forfeit
some functions

532
00:28:57,900 --> 00:29:00,980
has to be usable and anything about
maintainability

533
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:04,880
know is carrying what secured with the
Securities just have cost factor

534
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:08,440
nothing this is utterly wrong we need to
change that we need to talk to your kids

535
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:11,530
need to talk to our youngsters we need
to talk to education

536
00:29:11,530 --> 00:29:12,890
to get the security

537
00:29:12,890 --> 00:29:17,060
much much early n you should I say isn't
about swimming

538
00:29:17,060 --> 00:29:20,920
are you able to swim hussein to swim why

539
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:25,120
because you're your parents taught you

540
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:28,980
for your safety do you think of swimming
or did you think of safety when you're

541
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:29,530
swimming

542
00:29:29,530 --> 00:29:34,380
course you don't we should teach the
same thing into in terms of security

543
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:38,430
I so that people have to tell what a
phishing email is but they should do

544
00:29:38,430 --> 00:29:39,490
this automatically

545
00:29:39,490 --> 00:29:42,960
the change of mind summers awesome for
your password fishing don't ignore the

546
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:44,260
ignoring just deleted

547
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:49,150
the something up to teach people so to
wrap up

548
00:29:49,150 --> 00:29:53,540
I don't need any more stunned that

549
00:29:53,540 --> 00:30:00,540
if you working on this time a body on
security

550
00:30:02,650 --> 00:30:06,490
best honestly gas companies test and
that's the petroleum companies in

551
00:30:06,490 --> 00:30:07,610
chemical area

552
00:30:07,610 --> 00:30:11,840
the standouts in the oil company in
Europe and the oil companies

553
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:15,750
in Germany they are all companies in the
US three different standards

554
00:30:15,750 --> 00:30:19,640
electricity lots not just on electricity
in the US

555
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:22,700
and Germany and the Netherlands

556
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:27,590
and speed and in the region and do you
think they all translations of the same

557
00:30:27,590 --> 00:30:30,180
some not know they are not they all add
up to the country

558
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:34,300
I wonder why too many stomach to stop
that one

559
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:38,270
retirement defense in depth of course
between defense and DEP

560
00:30:38,270 --> 00:30:41,610
yes we do that for segregation to
depiction making mechanisms

561
00:30:41,610 --> 00:30:45,320
we doing from patching where we can even
oscilloscopes yes we're patching also

562
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:45,790
scope

563
00:30:45,790 --> 00:30:48,890
me pension promptly and so far I haven't
picked one

564
00:30:48,890 --> 00:30:53,870
still waiting for that day maybe a iris
I'm before but still of foundations of

565
00:30:53,870 --> 00:30:54,530
flawed

566
00:30:54,530 --> 00:30:59,670
I'd buy devices which cannot be secured
i buy devices which are not robust

567
00:30:59,670 --> 00:31:02,760
and I think this is something we have to
change we need to have an edge over

568
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:05,970
ability mitigation life cycle I would
like to be able to patch

569
00:31:05,970 --> 00:31:10,040
any device I have as quickly as possible
or do you think you will have it

570
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:13,820
touched you stay for your house thing on
a patch to stay nowadays Patch Tuesday

571
00:31:13,820 --> 00:31:14,560
ZZ

572
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:18,060
its automatic on my Windows PC here
maybe I'm on one of the few was running

573
00:31:18,060 --> 00:31:18,630
Windows here

574
00:31:18,630 --> 00:31:22,030
but later pictures to have to go around
my house

575
00:31:22,030 --> 00:31:25,720
update the Wii update my Apple TV

576
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:28,910
update my smart meter go out for the car

577
00:31:28,910 --> 00:31:32,070
then the fridge my nice espresso machine

578
00:31:32,070 --> 00:31:36,110
so I'm busy the whole Tuesday afternoon
pension money buys you know of no I'm

579
00:31:36,110 --> 00:31:37,620
pissed off at my Apple TV

580
00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:41,600
every time I'm using my f2f a TV very
rarely every time I'm using it

581
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:45,830
its saying there's a new download for
you available to be won in Seoul and now

582
00:31:45,830 --> 00:31:49,040
no I don't want to I would like to have
happened in the background but it's not

583
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:52,700
so do you want to do this no I think we
need to be much more agile

584
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:56,010
I like to see something which is more
robust weekend apply the patch is

585
00:31:56,010 --> 00:31:56,820
automatically

586
00:31:56,820 --> 00:32:00,680
I don't wanna run run around every
Wednesday and every Tuesday a month

587
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:04,240
and patching all my devices and the
device and getting few other guys are

588
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:08,800
getting more certification event

589
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:11,640
and devices this is what I'm looking for

590
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:14,940
the recipe of some real security experts

591
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:18,570
who can tell me you run those free tools
those tend to lose

592
00:32:18,570 --> 00:32:22,410
in the default configuration they all
open source to what you just download

593
00:32:22,410 --> 00:32:22,790
them

594
00:32:22,790 --> 00:32:26,280
you should imaging device and if it's
always showing green

595
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:29,860
then your device is reasonably secure

596
00:32:29,860 --> 00:32:33,520
I'm not saying I'm asking for indep
security we're talking about robustness

597
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:34,230
resilience

598
00:32:34,230 --> 00:32:38,770
something at the basic level and as long
as my device obtaining necessary

599
00:32:38,770 --> 00:32:43,430
I don't need a penetration testing once
missus is fine

600
00:32:43,430 --> 00:32:46,770
and all the other test three to a fine
then we can look at that penetration

601
00:32:46,770 --> 00:32:47,890
testing goalkeeper

602
00:32:47,890 --> 00:32:51,720
but as I'm a device to fail I don't need
to have more but someone needs to come

603
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:52,360
up with a list

604
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:55,940
this this I come to this but maybe
someone you guys can do this come up

605
00:32:55,940 --> 00:32:58,560
with a list of testing and saying okay
you run those test here

606
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:02,340
should this against devise and if
everything is fine you can claim it as

607
00:33:02,340 --> 00:33:03,090
your vices

608
00:33:03,090 --> 00:33:06,600
resilient enough that it can be a put
out into the field

609
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:13,600
IT technology is not bad

610
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:17,380
still they are not so to control systems
with believe they have to reinvent the

611
00:33:17,380 --> 00:33:17,740
wheel

612
00:33:17,740 --> 00:33:22,090
and I think this is something we have to
also choose to change at least with us

613
00:33:22,090 --> 00:33:25,670
our development now is using the same
technologies we using for the computer

614
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:26,220
center

615
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:29,560
maintain your computer center using
puppet gets

616
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:34,460
forman some other twists we doing the
same towards me now using

617
00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:38,140
for control systems suffered development
Atlassian

618
00:33:38,140 --> 00:33:41,410
gyro again kit using the same to us now

619
00:33:41,410 --> 00:33:44,980
for control systems having nightly
builds a bolus of that making aggression

620
00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:46,480
test looking what with the changes

621
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:49,880
to the changes have some impact on
safety up to am

622
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:53,200
on safety applications we can run
security scanners in parallel

623
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:57,640
static code analyzed on the softer to
figure out is the control software

624
00:33:57,640 --> 00:34:01,380
recently secured his to the stand above
our secure study called elisa's

625
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:05,000
and so on but this something which you
where we needed to make the step

626
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:08,989
forward at all and developers accepting
this we don't a few developers

627
00:34:08,990 --> 00:34:12,300
we talk about Sonic Free onto for
developers just doing development of

628
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:13,230
control systems

629
00:34:13,230 --> 00:34:16,310
and last but not least

630
00:34:16,310 --> 00:34:21,770
swimming and security I think we have to
go back to our universities in C

631
00:34:21,770 --> 00:34:25,970
whether the teaching of security is
whether nicely embedded

632
00:34:25,970 --> 00:34:29,929
into the over curriculum is this done at
the right time

633
00:34:29,929 --> 00:34:35,630
is this time too early too late do want
to have security courses at all I do

634
00:34:35,630 --> 00:34:36,870
want to have the security course

635
00:34:36,870 --> 00:34:41,250
embedded which each of the different
topics I don't know

636
00:34:41,250 --> 00:34:47,590
and i think is open for discussion so if
you want to see more about certain this

637
00:34:47,590 --> 00:34:49,190
a film called angels and demons

638
00:34:49,190 --> 00:34:52,320
five minutes I do they are donated to us

639
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:58,200
if you're younger this also for Muppets

640
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:01,000
you have been invited to come to certain
we have for public tours

641
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:04,700
not anymore on the ground because we're
not shutting down excited to restart it

642
00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:05,240
but there

643
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:09,190
a lot of us it honors which you can have
a look at if you want to see your

644
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:10,280
computer center

645
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:15,600
I'm just go on Google Maps draw the
small me think on Google Maps on to the

646
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:19,580
onto the I'm onto the computer center
and you can we were on the computer

647
00:35:19,580 --> 00:35:21,110
center to have a look inside to

648
00:35:21,110 --> 00:35:25,080
for those ones want to be challenged we
have hidden some thanks 30 small little

649
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:26,680
many fix the computer center

650
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:30,400
if you find the more you get a small
them a small gift from me maybe a

651
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:31,840
t-shirt with a Lagrangian like

652
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:38,840
like that thank you very much Christians

653
00:35:52,940 --> 00:35:54,770
will

654
00:35:54,770 --> 00:35:56,329
yeah

655
00:35:56,329 --> 00:36:03,329
let me first so should think

656
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:15,100
no we just meeting thing publication to
have

657
00:36:22,940 --> 00:36:26,380
so so the question is what do you think
about nuclear reactors in the security

658
00:36:26,380 --> 00:36:28,180
of the cybersecurity erectus

659
00:36:28,180 --> 00:36:31,390
this what is your question legacy liza

660
00:36:31,390 --> 00:36:34,590
I'm not coming out on the pier what I
know it is from the nuclei

661
00:36:34,590 --> 00:36:38,780
from energy companies which are running
nuclear devices the EA and again and so

662
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:40,440
on I think they doing a vast

663
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:44,610
effort in securing the devices into
having the same safety levers

664
00:36:44,610 --> 00:36:48,660
in cyber security than they have in nama
safety so I think they doing good but

665
00:36:48,660 --> 00:36:53,730
I'm an expert in give you the right
answer more questions

666
00:36:53,730 --> 00:37:00,730
ok

667
00:37:27,450 --> 00:37:30,160
I get your point to the point she's
making is that

668
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:34,140
not so ben is asking for input house
which how to secure the devices

669
00:37:34,140 --> 00:37:37,170
and I think we limit on what
generalizing here

670
00:37:37,170 --> 00:37:41,050
their vendors which are very proactive
and they doing very good in protecting

671
00:37:41,050 --> 00:37:41,970
the devices and

672
00:37:41,970 --> 00:37:45,840
and trying to talk to the community the
other vendors

673
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:49,230
who were completely ignorant so I'm the
truth somewhere between yes

674
00:37:49,230 --> 00:37:56,230
copyright I'm sorry

675
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:16,160
so

676
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:19,940
follow control systems and Prince movie
we've made an assessment is control

677
00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:22,720
system has made its assessment their
control systems

678
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:27,130
other the question is what is the
consequence

679
00:38:27,130 --> 00:38:30,770
when when we doing the patching is there
any risk to the to the patching

680
00:38:30,770 --> 00:38:34,830
so we with them unless there's some
systems like the the drill machines all

681
00:38:34,830 --> 00:38:35,790
the laser cutters

682
00:38:35,790 --> 00:38:38,950
well I don't care so they can patch
anytime the worst thing that can happen

683
00:38:38,950 --> 00:38:39,450
is

684
00:38:39,450 --> 00:38:42,540
that the laser cut us down for 48 hours
because have to get somebody from the

685
00:38:42,540 --> 00:38:43,270
support in

686
00:38:43,270 --> 00:38:47,350
from the home country to make a repair
we don't care for the systems which are

687
00:38:47,350 --> 00:38:48,110
sensitive

688
00:38:48,110 --> 00:38:51,670
which you can I rebooted running times
we shot the men during the maintenance

689
00:38:51,670 --> 00:38:53,150
window switches every six weeks

690
00:38:53,150 --> 00:38:56,470
and then we do the patching every six
week or even longer we get some systems

691
00:38:56,470 --> 00:38:57,620
which have been patched for

692
00:38:57,620 --> 00:39:01,530
four-year because those just need to be
up all time and then we offense the

693
00:39:01,530 --> 00:39:02,520
systems and

694
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:06,030
and put all the bets missus round two to
make sure that them if something's

695
00:39:06,030 --> 00:39:07,210
happening we get there

696
00:39:07,210 --> 00:39:11,740
we get early warning in any case for the
control systems we have

697
00:39:11,740 --> 00:39:15,030
at these what we can say is if the
country if the servers are going down

698
00:39:15,030 --> 00:39:16,700
Windows PCs are going down

699
00:39:16,700 --> 00:39:20,390
we bring the machine will bring the beam
into a safe state which means that damn

700
00:39:20,390 --> 00:39:24,470
if you think of as a teacher up to TNT
there are exit methods to attack serb

701
00:39:24,470 --> 00:39:25,900
this eighty kilograms in T&T

702
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:29,390
once one system is down the eighty
cubans can t is

703
00:39:29,390 --> 00:39:36,390
the smallest exited and then it's the
same state

704
00:39:49,110 --> 00:39:52,780
I don't have the statistic on this so
I'm are shown some of the the media

705
00:39:52,780 --> 00:39:54,070
articles I'm reading

706
00:39:54,070 --> 00:39:57,330
arm give 24 don't know that the

707
00:39:57,330 --> 00:40:01,400
media is giving more attention to those
both both from abilities in both attacks

708
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:04,000
or they might increase automatically
because the media coverage

709
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:07,410
I can verify whether everything what has
been written that is true or not

710
00:40:07,410 --> 00:40:13,250
I have my doubts concerning certain at
the moment we don't see any big change

711
00:40:13,250 --> 00:40:16,400
in the in the tracks in the threats
narita Sun

712
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:19,600
so I'm p.m. for example so far not seen
any dedicated

713
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:24,560
attack against the Red Sea oil too well

714
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:31,560
more questions

715
00:40:43,930 --> 00:40:45,020
some that breast at this

716
00:40:45,020 --> 00:40:48,089
this would be something like you like
your like it like a bad case scenario

717
00:40:48,089 --> 00:40:51,829
if a device infected study infecting
other devices

718
00:40:51,829 --> 00:40:58,829
and Prince ok

719
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:04,880
0 not the chance to turn off to get
always the chance to turn off

720
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:08,819
so in the worst case we turn off but
then we lose being time which means that

721
00:41:08,819 --> 00:41:10,180
the economics writers

722
00:41:10,180 --> 00:41:14,569
in the end the costs are controllable so
then that case would just shut down

723
00:41:14,569 --> 00:41:18,020
reinstall main thing is Asian than the
McKean

724
00:41:18,020 --> 00:41:22,260
but we had cases where on the other side
for the experiments you know the the

725
00:41:22,260 --> 00:41:23,079
digital cameras

726
00:41:23,079 --> 00:41:28,030
we had once an experiment in 2007 which
was compromised and that system we did

727
00:41:28,030 --> 00:41:28,540
not

728
00:41:28,540 --> 00:41:33,630
shut down because ap look at some if you
if your small experiment with us on like

729
00:41:33,630 --> 00:41:37,290
fifty people you been up to experiment
you getting the beam you get two weeks

730
00:41:37,290 --> 00:41:38,069
have been time

731
00:41:38,069 --> 00:41:42,040
which means you're just two weeks lot we
can you can can get collisions

732
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:45,410
and I'm fortune would happen that case
was the device was compromised three

733
00:41:45,410 --> 00:41:46,530
days within this

734
00:41:46,530 --> 00:41:50,020
to ease up in time shutting it down at
that very moment would have been

735
00:41:50,020 --> 00:41:53,280
that the experiment is is done for the
year no data

736
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:56,980
to come to this what we were doing in
that case we did three hours forensic

737
00:41:56,980 --> 00:41:58,050
and looking what happened

738
00:41:58,050 --> 00:42:01,430
the defense the server with a complete a
compromise server running for another

739
00:42:01,430 --> 00:42:02,140
two weeks

740
00:42:02,140 --> 00:42:06,640
at Sun out to let them finish the the
day to take enough to HBO

741
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:09,660
we shut it down should it's a triage

742
00:42:09,660 --> 00:42:12,609
you have to see but this is everybody is
doing this if your computer centers

743
00:42:12,609 --> 00:42:15,800
compromise I think nobody is shutting
down computers and some compromise for

744
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:16,730
to try to figure out

745
00:42:16,730 --> 00:42:20,000
how it happened what happened and
whether it's worth it shutting down a

746
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,650
way would be to mitigate it differently

747
00:42:21,650 --> 00:42:28,650
questions

748
00:42:35,830 --> 00:42:38,900
so the question is without a concrete
frets now are you

749
00:42:38,900 --> 00:42:43,290
how can you justify cost icon some
principal

750
00:42:43,290 --> 00:42:46,600
but why should I what why should I
justify cost for security

751
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:49,560
I'm not justifying cost for
functionality or usability

752
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:50,480
maintainability

753
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:53,700
I'm not justifying cost availability so
I'm

754
00:42:53,700 --> 00:42:58,220
in that case security is again it's one
of the IT things its ending with a I T Y

755
00:42:58,220 --> 00:42:59,190
so I'm

756
00:42:59,190 --> 00:43:02,220
it should be treated like the other ones
and Prince movie got to get a risk

757
00:43:02,220 --> 00:43:02,860
assessment

758
00:43:02,860 --> 00:43:06,360
3 know well we have to concentrate
because I can invest in any corner

759
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:10,090
to do security better three no more or
less from assessments where we need to

760
00:43:10,090 --> 00:43:11,030
invest more

761
00:43:11,030 --> 00:43:18,030
and do what we can deliver if I am save
this location data plan

762
00:43:30,670 --> 00:43:34,109
you like poking into my loans aren't you
the question is do we have a Q+A

763
00:43:34,109 --> 00:43:36,289
environment for control systems

764
00:43:36,289 --> 00:43:40,839
I'm the elite she is a prototype there's
only one awaits you in word and then

765
00:43:40,839 --> 00:43:44,400
know for that we don't have a second one
so most control systems

766
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:48,160
have test call us test that's where you
do the

767
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:51,299
this offer the moment on in the first

768
00:43:51,299 --> 00:43:55,359
for situations but in this at a certain
level you need to move to the real

769
00:43:55,359 --> 00:43:57,859
device because the interaction between
tax rate is

770
00:43:57,859 --> 00:44:00,920
and the controls in the control group a
quite complex

771
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:04,109
and this we can only do it with having
the real gnashing life

772
00:44:04,109 --> 00:44:07,440
sometimes even with having p.m. in the
machine but this is then

773
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:11,039
way restricted development can be done
so we get a balance on this one

774
00:44:11,039 --> 00:44:14,250
I'm it's not the most optimal balance
we're trying to move this

775
00:44:14,250 --> 00:44:17,849
more to the test and some far away from
the exciter moment

776
00:44:17,849 --> 00:44:22,750
yes get a Q+A to a certain extent and
then we know D to go live it's a little

777
00:44:22,750 --> 00:44:24,200
different than than

778
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:28,460
non-production times where they have a a
full-blown test them for everything

779
00:44:28,460 --> 00:44:35,460
and then they can rule out into the
plant recap

780
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:43,599
depends on the system some sis some some
citizens are very independent of being

781
00:44:43,599 --> 00:44:46,660
and independent commission they can do
all the testing for some effect

782
00:44:46,660 --> 00:44:49,710
if you look at investor controlled
crowds and excluding ventilation

783
00:44:49,710 --> 00:44:50,430
electricity

784
00:44:50,430 --> 00:44:53,760
those devices i I'm stunned out

785
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:57,339
industrial installations which you find
everywhere else

786
00:44:57,339 --> 00:45:01,049
they had developed completely offline on
test stands and then they rode out and a

787
00:45:01,049 --> 00:45:01,500
few

788
00:45:01,500 --> 00:45:05,130
if you come closer to operations affects
writer

789
00:45:05,130 --> 00:45:08,640
the more you come to dedicated hardware
dedicated software and this is where

790
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:11,269
your shift is then going more towards
the x-ray to

791
00:45:11,269 --> 00:45:15,490
but there's still some some from area
where we can work on

792
00:45:15,490 --> 00:45:22,490
and went to work on questions

793
00:45:26,460 --> 00:45:32,010
from governments I think I'm not dead
but to that question I will not answer

794
00:45:32,010 --> 00:45:32,829
this question

795
00:45:32,829 --> 00:45:37,250
at the moment the government's I'm
investing lots of money into security

796
00:45:37,250 --> 00:45:40,660
but I don't see whether this money is
really giving products which are useful

797
00:45:40,660 --> 00:45:41,940
for at least for us

798
00:45:41,940 --> 00:45:48,940
from but no most on that please just
yeah

799
00:45:59,030 --> 00:46:02,280
to do have control system which which we
decided to cross reason not to patch

800
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:02,690
them

801
00:46:02,690 --> 00:46:09,690
and principal not catching because of
cost them a patch or not

802
00:46:10,450 --> 00:46:13,480
not be able to a two things some if you
can patch

803
00:46:13,480 --> 00:46:18,180
I'm there's an there's and there's a
there's a paradigm which means should

804
00:46:18,180 --> 00:46:22,250
must patch said woman me too need to
patch unusually

805
00:46:22,250 --> 00:46:25,870
we're following standard evolution so
movie when XP to seven

806
00:46:25,870 --> 00:46:29,540
moving from redheads 6 threat at seven
right at five to six

807
00:46:29,540 --> 00:46:32,670
and this is the the break point we have
to up in any case I'm

808
00:46:32,670 --> 00:46:36,000
we have a very few systems which are not
patched

809
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:40,260
but although since I like the the
cad/cam systems which I'm principal

810
00:46:40,260 --> 00:46:43,980
I don't care yeah if if this cap comes
as shown they all the

811
00:46:43,980 --> 00:46:47,040
on the laser cut they getting infected
so what

812
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:49,560
they getting fact that they're not
sitting on our control stepper they

813
00:46:49,560 --> 00:46:51,290
actually sitting in my office networks

814
00:46:51,290 --> 00:46:54,790
so they're sitting somewhere where they
don't harm and down one of its network

815
00:46:54,790 --> 00:46:55,730
they getting infected

816
00:46:55,730 --> 00:47:02,730
just reinstalling from scratch the
critic once for operations we try to

817
00:47:02,900 --> 00:47:04,640
patch as soon as we can

818
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:11,640
because time he is always them its
definition

819
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:28,800
do we do assessment of well of the
system's I think

820
00:47:32,370 --> 00:47:35,110
this when we do that in principle every
device we getting in

821
00:47:35,110 --> 00:47:38,770
we're trying to penetration test so this
interesting tried to it to get an idea

822
00:47:38,770 --> 00:47:44,160
how secure how the device setup and then
key for my work is in mint Oreos

823
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:47,890
every device connected to our networks
is registered in the database so I know

824
00:47:47,890 --> 00:47:49,170
every device non-network

825
00:47:49,170 --> 00:47:53,800
I know every account into every web page
I we're now working on dependency secure

826
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:54,760
control system

827
00:47:54,760 --> 00:47:57,840
control system engineers a supposed to
understand the dependency for control

828
00:47:57,840 --> 00:47:58,360
system

829
00:47:58,360 --> 00:48:02,510
on other control systems but also on on
the underlying technologies

830
00:48:02,510 --> 00:48:07,150
city controller serving NTP you need to
have SACP meaning to the pilots ever

831
00:48:07,150 --> 00:48:08,960
somewhere local database

832
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:13,370
add up Active Directory may be based on
campus I mean servicing a chance on so

833
00:48:13,370 --> 00:48:20,370
this all things which we know building
up and then

834
00:48:30,630 --> 00:48:33,290
no I think I benefit just on the other
side

835
00:48:33,290 --> 00:48:37,200
welcome thing of the past there was
never a team doing control system that

836
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:37,740
works

837
00:48:37,740 --> 00:48:43,490
and I was not routine doing IT networks
know we doing that one team was doing on

838
00:48:43,490 --> 00:48:44,470
that working at San

839
00:48:44,470 --> 00:48:48,500
tweeting for competence of them to do
with network connectivity itself

840
00:48:48,500 --> 00:48:53,280
for control systems and for the computer
center in the pasta we always discussion

841
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:53,690
about

842
00:48:53,690 --> 00:48:57,630
availability and reaction time bandwidth
and throughput and so on

843
00:48:57,630 --> 00:49:01,050
but now it's the same the same for
databases we don't have it and gave him

844
00:49:01,050 --> 00:49:03,500
a standing offer the control sector the
databases and so on

845
00:49:03,500 --> 00:49:06,720
provided by the IT department with
database administrators who know what

846
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:07,340
they're doing

847
00:49:07,340 --> 00:49:10,430
so they're doing the patching up the
databases in soon

848
00:49:10,430 --> 00:49:14,470
with the control system experts are not
necessarily very quickly

849
00:49:14,470 --> 00:49:18,690
a tricky enough that it's for fits my
needs and we can operate X-rated

850
00:49:18,690 --> 00:49:20,180
operating system

851
00:49:20,180 --> 00:49:24,070
for the control system operating system
no coming from the IT department so this

852
00:49:24,070 --> 00:49:25,840
is where they are to be published
jumping in

853
00:49:25,840 --> 00:49:28,940
we try to move everything away from the
control systems which

854
00:49:28,940 --> 00:49:32,460
I'm not gene control systems operating
system but I T

855
00:49:32,460 --> 00:49:37,550
webservice it. mating IT networking I T
wireless communication I T

856
00:49:37,550 --> 00:49:41,110
and so on this on a move toward trying
to move with norm want to the IT

857
00:49:41,110 --> 00:49:41,760
department

858
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:44,800
Jarrad get all the tools at the moment

859
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:48,190
the controls people are running their
own jar and get instances but I hope

860
00:49:48,190 --> 00:49:49,020
that in the future

861
00:49:49,020 --> 00:49:52,690
we cannot quite this virtualization this
was a recent separate done

862
00:49:52,690 --> 00:49:56,140
lots of controls development is done on
virtualized a.m.

863
00:49:56,140 --> 00:50:03,140
out where and virtualization custer's
maintained by the IT department

864
00:50:11,260 --> 00:50:14,640
this this happened 10 years ago when the
country if you look at the control

865
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:15,520
system itself

866
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:19,650
the time when the vendors move to the
Windows platform and using TCP IP

867
00:50:19,650 --> 00:50:22,160
instead of more puzzle pro people so
whatever its

868
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:26,550
this was the time with a threat some
ability to treat them so I think than

869
00:50:26,550 --> 00:50:29,640
you won't let you never make the step
back you never

870
00:50:29,640 --> 00:50:33,450
fix this again and move back to profit
bus I think the

871
00:50:33,450 --> 00:50:36,400
the IT technologies have also the
benefits something we just have to get

872
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:38,240
the security now properly integrated

873
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:45,240
and this is a big step

874
00:50:45,610 --> 00:50:49,570
I come to the congress of the security
team my security meeting with all types

875
00:50:49,570 --> 00:50:50,980
of security incidents at Sun

876
00:50:50,980 --> 00:50:54,990
control system is just a part of this
but again you got a computer center

877
00:50:54,990 --> 00:50:59,080
is a control system failing all the main
so I'm home page

878
00:50:59,080 --> 00:51:02,660
web server fading what is more
detrimental to the organization

879
00:51:02,660 --> 00:51:06,300
know you do a risk assessment can do
some balancing and so you can pick out

880
00:51:06,300 --> 00:51:09,520
but in the end I'm its its Melissa same
thing

881
00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:16,520
so those groups are physicist

882
00:51:23,070 --> 00:51:26,970
they can do the analyze this the freedom
of academia which efforts and some

883
00:51:26,970 --> 00:51:30,990
control systems are not written in power
impasse guy fucking a basic that we're

884
00:51:30,990 --> 00:51:32,460
talking about the analyzes jobs

885
00:51:32,460 --> 00:51:36,050
to take the collision pictures mentoring
them lies on top of this this their

886
00:51:36,050 --> 00:51:36,610
freedom

887
00:51:36,610 --> 00:51:41,050
they can use language in honestly this
software is not even security critical

888
00:51:41,050 --> 00:51:41,620
because

889
00:51:41,620 --> 00:51:44,680
what with a list analyzes and then that
we get something which they don't want

890
00:51:44,680 --> 00:51:45,330
to get so

891
00:51:45,330 --> 00:51:48,580
this is not critical for the big project
the control systems

892
00:51:48,580 --> 00:51:51,960
there are environments where the people
of also program in C C++

893
00:51:51,960 --> 00:51:55,750
spoke on Java and then you can have the
softer than life cycle on top of this

894
00:51:55,750 --> 00:52:02,750
second we got

895
00:52:13,970 --> 00:52:15,680
do we have control system which of front

896
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:20,049
those were you asking I we doing again
and again life cycles on all devices

897
00:52:20,049 --> 00:52:21,559
with now running another

898
00:52:21,559 --> 00:52:26,680
life cycle every devices has registered
reviewing regulary whether devices 11

899
00:52:26,680 --> 00:52:28,230
owner who is actually it's on

900
00:52:28,230 --> 00:52:34,069
was taking responsibility I'm very based
on my side I got

901
00:52:34,069 --> 00:52:37,309
for everything I can see I would like to
live sighting device working on

902
00:52:37,309 --> 00:52:41,779
for web pages you leave Sun your web
pages I either given to you supervise or

903
00:52:41,779 --> 00:52:42,390
deleted

904
00:52:42,390 --> 00:52:45,390
you leave said on your account is
getting blocked you made to delete it

905
00:52:45,390 --> 00:52:47,549
and to date has gone after a certain
time period

906
00:52:47,549 --> 00:52:51,609
you leave some to revise the to be
propagated to your supervisor

907
00:52:51,609 --> 00:52:55,369
& Sohn file an opening for a lifesaver
for pie what will pick you ask for pie

908
00:52:55,369 --> 00:52:56,119
when opening

909
00:52:56,119 --> 00:52:59,930
we do some initial testing you get your
opening and every month we looking

910
00:52:59,930 --> 00:53:01,579
whether they're traffic to your device

911
00:53:01,579 --> 00:53:05,029
and whether you still have an HTTP
Server whatever you ask for well that's

912
00:53:05,029 --> 00:53:06,380
a service listening on the part

913
00:53:06,380 --> 00:53:09,700
if not we close this I think inventories
and file

914
00:53:09,700 --> 00:53:13,319
and and life cycles are the most
important things for me running security

915
00:53:13,319 --> 00:53:14,019
operations

916
00:53:14,019 --> 00:53:19,390
Andrew ok

917
00:53:19,390 --> 00:53:23,400
have to find somebody taking
responsibility

918
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:26,630
so I'm this something the concert which
I didn't introduce here

919
00:53:26,630 --> 00:53:31,359
but them I am NOT the person responsible
for security it's on

920
00:53:31,359 --> 00:53:35,230
we have delegated security to everybody
who is running

921
00:53:35,230 --> 00:53:38,940
system so if you are control control
system expert you and

922
00:53:38,940 --> 00:53:42,190
in first instance responsible for the
security of your control system

923
00:53:42,190 --> 00:53:46,250
and we are here as a security measure
facilitating in a blur

924
00:53:46,250 --> 00:53:49,279
to get the security right with the IT
department was giving him

925
00:53:49,279 --> 00:53:53,460
you the all the 2022 running a database
give the database that can be poppin you

926
00:53:53,460 --> 00:53:55,950
do need to take care about orkut and
patching whatever's

927
00:53:55,950 --> 00:54:00,230
often systems we try to identify them as
quickly as possible

928
00:54:00,230 --> 00:54:03,960
and then this happened to somebody who
can take responsibility

929
00:54:03,960 --> 00:54:10,960
or weaken the system's minutes

930
00:54:35,050 --> 00:54:36,440
so how do you motivate manage

931
00:54:36,440 --> 00:54:40,870
management to pray to invest in sink
into security I think the best

932
00:54:40,870 --> 00:54:45,030
in center for management in security is
from time to time a small security

933
00:54:45,030 --> 00:54:45,730
incident

934
00:54:45,730 --> 00:54:49,040
this is what's the most the most
brilliant think

935
00:54:49,040 --> 00:54:52,320
yes something like hockey brilliant I
love top

936
00:54:52,320 --> 00:54:55,860
I'm sorry I shouldn't say this and you
guys should write that up

937
00:54:55,860 --> 00:54:59,710
but white why did allow Hopley a

938
00:54:59,710 --> 00:55:04,950
it was tricky public public sized it has
sufficient impact in the media stand by

939
00:55:04,950 --> 00:55:08,140
management learned about this and many
other people it's and learned about this

940
00:55:08,140 --> 00:55:11,710
it was very easy to patch and fix apart
from some some

941
00:55:11,710 --> 00:55:15,230
devices where we still waiting for the
patches from the Big Bend us but that

942
00:55:15,230 --> 00:55:16,570
motor things to fix tricky

943
00:55:16,570 --> 00:55:20,960
and I use this to change all the
possible turn because I was 100 percent

944
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:22,820
sure that we didn't think anything

945
00:55:22,820 --> 00:55:25,670
I'm pretty sure that by nineteen I
personally didn't think anything but

946
00:55:25,670 --> 00:55:26,150
still

947
00:55:26,150 --> 00:55:29,820
change your passwords is also then in
fostering the

948
00:55:29,820 --> 00:55:34,710
the awareness of management so this is
what working fine comparison between to

949
00:55:34,710 --> 00:55:35,790
lay into a B

950
00:55:35,790 --> 00:55:39,140
the proteases operations at Sun so I'm
first

951
00:55:39,140 --> 00:55:43,240
protease safe operation not harming
anybody

952
00:55:43,240 --> 00:55:46,560
not harming the environment not
destroying the traitor the second thing

953
00:55:46,560 --> 00:55:47,830
is operation itself

954
00:55:47,830 --> 00:55:52,570
and then come security the

955
00:55:52,570 --> 00:55:59,570
on the question

956
00:56:00,290 --> 00:56:03,730
every time we find something we me talk
to the vendors

957
00:56:03,730 --> 00:56:07,140
try to explain why we think it's up to
me how they've implement this

958
00:56:07,140 --> 00:56:10,240
nope

959
00:56:10,240 --> 00:56:14,330
I'm we had some some information
exchange between governments

960
00:56:14,330 --> 00:56:18,680
I'm which is called the US cuz European
has got a control system information

961
00:56:18,680 --> 00:56:19,250
exchange

962
00:56:19,250 --> 00:56:24,180
without big no vendors but they're big
utilities and governments were present

963
00:56:24,180 --> 00:56:27,390
I'm but we have never been this on on

964
00:56:27,390 --> 00:56:34,390
on the body we talking directly with one

965
00:56:37,300 --> 00:56:41,559
big spenders very good one so I'm big
ben is now a days they have sets

966
00:56:41,559 --> 00:56:44,809
to talk to the surgical and storage to
the search and they say oh that's not

967
00:56:44,809 --> 00:56:45,230
good

968
00:56:45,230 --> 00:56:49,220
we'll fix it and they will notify you so
I we can improve I think they can

969
00:56:49,220 --> 00:56:50,510
improve on that to have

970
00:56:50,510 --> 00:56:53,819
better disco just like a I'm

971
00:56:53,819 --> 00:56:56,950
smaller than this the problem is they
don't even understand what you say

972
00:56:56,950 --> 00:57:01,230
because they just they bought the TCP IP
stack from somebody

973
00:57:01,230 --> 00:57:05,200
and then they just using the TCP IP
stack and if you tell them that there's

974
00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:07,349
a buffer overflow they just say yes but
it's a

975
00:57:07,349 --> 00:57:10,770
its library from outside so we come to
anything so they had to learn more

976
00:57:10,770 --> 00:57:13,040
difficult and again then

977
00:57:13,040 --> 00:57:16,380
depends on how critical is the
application if you look at the does a

978
00:57:16,380 --> 00:57:17,150
meter reader

979
00:57:17,150 --> 00:57:21,550
if you can have the password or not this
is not leaking any sensitive information

980
00:57:21,550 --> 00:57:21,880
this is

981
00:57:21,880 --> 00:57:25,290
personal data indicates it's not
critical so that we would prompt them

982
00:57:25,290 --> 00:57:28,980
reset fix it and I think a two years
later they came up with something which

983
00:57:28,980 --> 00:57:29,770
was more robust

984
00:57:29,770 --> 00:57:34,130
if relief yeah if you wanna come to
discuss we can go outside
