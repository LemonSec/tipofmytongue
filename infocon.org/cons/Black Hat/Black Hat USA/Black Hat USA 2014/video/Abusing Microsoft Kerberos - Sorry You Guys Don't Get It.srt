1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:04,029
this session is abusing Microsoft Corp
rose

2
00:00:04,029 --> 00:00:07,399
you can read sorry you guys don't get it

3
00:00:07,399 --> 00:00:14,399
skip to quell Benjamin you're gonna
alright area

4
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:18,720
I skipper Paul ASX's

5
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:22,390
pledge dopey I'll tells

6
00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:26,039
part I I don't have a French accent so

7
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:29,849
should be pretty easy I know it's kinda
confusing so

8
00:00:29,849 --> 00:00:32,989
good so Spencer and his the

9
00:00:32,989 --> 00:00:39,700
author meat-axe hour to talk about
Windows Active Directory

10
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:42,969
a many cats anti-tax

11
00:00:42,969 --> 00:00:46,820
to appoint Kerberos pass the hash

12
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:49,930
past he's past decade retard the

13
00:00:49,930 --> 00:00:54,789
golden ticket to as well and over gonna
have three live demos

14
00:00:54,789 --> 00:00:59,250
hopefully and so although I also wanted
to mention

15
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:03,180
that all demo server to do will work
from a non

16
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:08,350
domain joint Computer as well so

17
00:01:08,350 --> 00:01:11,890
remember past the hash a yeah it still
works

18
00:01:11,890 --> 00:01:15,950
despite what the Kb era Senate which
might say on Twitter

19
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:19,490
0 just a quick reminder

20
00:01:19,490 --> 00:01:23,330
so user will type is username and
password in

21
00:01:23,330 --> 00:01:26,479
I hashes yitzhak you ate it a

22
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:30,040
in Alsace and then as part of the
process

23
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:36,590
the those hash used for authentication
pass the hatch supply skipping

24
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:39,600
typing in the username/password part up

25
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:43,439
putting the passed directly into else s
and

26
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:47,600
a then of the kid authentication will
still work because

27
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:51,100
into your protocol uses ashes password

28
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:54,710
once art school

29
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:59,930
it still works a however there are some
environments where

30
00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:04,100
T-lam I might be disabled there's also a
new

31
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:07,939
security features the new ever since
when does call protected users which is

32
00:02:07,939 --> 00:02:09,270
a group that

33
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:12,750
you can put people in the changes the
way that

34
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:16,370
houses are presented memory in the
authentication they can use

35
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:19,370
I'll and

36
00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:22,650
also you know maybe you just don't wanna
leave a lot and chillin

37
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:26,120
authentication footprints in the event
log

38
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:30,650
as your doing whatever it is you're
doing so

39
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:34,140
Kerberos is all about keys

40
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:37,450
tickets I'll in this any

41
00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:41,520
what we'll talk about is user
administrator watched access

42
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:46,870
CSS on owen et one box on the chocolate
to local domain

43
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:50,940
other three sets of keys that are
involved in all of them were in Active

44
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:51,620
Directory

45
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:57,940
and all of them are derived from a
password %uh the KTC

46
00:02:57,940 --> 00:03:01,870
long-term secret key this is d Central
Trust

47
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:06,530
he for all of her Bruce its use to sign
in

48
00:03:06,530 --> 00:03:10,470
crips everything that the KTC slash t-
just its access to

49
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:15,730
there's a client long-term secret key
this is typically a user's password

50
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:19,360
words derived from the user's password I

51
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:23,640
ands as used as part of the as: rectory
crips

52
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:26,740
the such key

53
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:32,400
and then the targets a slush services
are typically computer counties

54
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:37,010
that are used when you request service
ticket ans

55
00:03:37,010 --> 00:03:41,209
is used to encrypt the session keys
provided by the TGS to both

56
00:03:41,209 --> 00:03:45,230
user West session key and to the service
that your request

57
00:03:45,230 --> 00:03:50,080
from a so typically the way this works
is

58
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:54,150
user what skin types is his name
password depending on your

59
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:57,250
two main functional level all flights
got set

60
00:03:57,250 --> 00:04:01,390
one or both whole different keys just
created

61
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:05,010
Elsas I'll the all tests

62
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:08,220
our C four which is essentially the
T-lam

63
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:13,269
hash a a and the newer AES 128 256

64
00:04:13,269 --> 00:04:19,810
those are used as per the hysterectomy
crypt timestamp that time stamp if it

65
00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:23,780
checks out by the KTC you receive this
part of the easiest

66
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:26,790
apply a valid TGT

67
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:30,040
which you didn't turn around and percent
to

68
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:34,220
the TGS to request access to a service

69
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:37,710
AST and as part of that you get service
ticket back

70
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:43,570
and then you send a service ticket to
the services you request suppress

71
00:04:43,570 --> 00:04:44,770
indication as i mentioned

72
00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:48,280
preaches previously something occur for
us five added

73
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:51,510
to prevent you from

74
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:55,949
arbitrarily just getting a TGT just by
asking for you have to prove that you

75
00:04:55,949 --> 00:04:57,479
are who you say you are buying

76
00:04:57,479 --> 00:05:01,030
cryptic timestamp jackets validated by
the KDC

77
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:07,930
before they send you a at:

78
00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:11,080
a TGT is script with key

79
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:15,290
shared by all up the other TTC's TGS is

80
00:05:15,290 --> 00:05:19,380
domain namely the QWERTY down I'll

81
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:22,770
aunt as part of the process

82
00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:25,950
a pack very privileged attribute

83
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:29,530
certificates at it that includes that it
is stated this

84
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:32,530
data is encrypted by the KTC

85
00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:37,870
spark both TGT I'll

86
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:41,080
in addition 40 GTE's the

87
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:45,500
CDC sign the ticket sagely with the
exact same

88
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:50,090
actually just scripted RTDs tickets
using and abusing

89
00:05:50,090 --> 00:05:53,570
different key to sign it sport

90
00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:56,760
so

91
00:05:56,760 --> 00:06:00,180
the kerchief now password slash hash

92
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:03,840
only changes by default %uh

93
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:07,210
during K to me functionality

94
00:06:07,210 --> 00:06:11,190
functional level change and only if you
switch

95
00:06:11,190 --> 00:06:16,680
25-26 so if you're going from 2008 she
does

96
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:22,300
32 made functional level 2008 for 2012
that's there would be a

97
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:25,510
32-year-old that's because the newer

98
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:29,200
26 versions have to calculate it yes he
is part of it

99
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:32,630
om so

100
00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:37,030
however if you're going for two thousand
H 2012 they're still

101
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:43,130
Newkirk TGT has tickets Jerry also to a
bare metal recovery using to restore

102
00:06:43,130 --> 00:06:43,730
media

103
00:06:43,730 --> 00:06:46,920
to hear actually remembers what they did
with that

104
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:50,500
password they set up the domain ten
years ago

105
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:55,930
anybody okay one guy

106
00:06:55,930 --> 00:06:59,940
home or if it's badly changed as part of
a compromise recovery

107
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:03,690
all however that his in various stages

108
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:07,130
there may not be supported by Microsoft
ending which web page

109
00:07:07,130 --> 00:07:11,050
read om and

110
00:07:11,050 --> 00:07:14,280
the Ste the truth is that most

111
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:18,610
enterprises that password has changed
years I have seen

112
00:07:18,610 --> 00:07:21,690
just the past year

113
00:07:21,690 --> 00:07:25,170
to me that had Kurt YouTube account if
you do it

114
00:07:25,170 --> 00:07:28,190
use purchase back to me

115
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:31,260
it was last changed in 2005

116
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:37,410
oMG theres order out there so

117
00:07:37,410 --> 00:07:40,600
the internal format for process actually
just a day or so

118
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:44,430
one coded seek is your favorite to go to
talk to

119
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:48,270
to read through it other ticket format
is documented spars

120
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:51,570
RC and Microsoft suspect for the pack

121
00:07:51,570 --> 00:07:56,960
format as well prefer talk about a new
feature that

122
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:03,610
weird we're introducing call overpass
the hash survivor I said the date/time

123
00:08:03,610 --> 00:08:04,680
stamp was being

124
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:09,130
scripted by the users long-term key in
that tell you to mister you have access

125
00:08:09,130 --> 00:08:09,820
to

126
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:13,810
housework I'll well you can actually if
you

127
00:08:13,810 --> 00:08:18,280
have the end-to-end hatch from users you
can

128
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:21,620
then just simply encrypt the timestamp
said

129
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:26,010
CDC and you've demonstrated the same
thing is if you typed in the password

130
00:08:26,010 --> 00:08:28,740
because you have to keep the kids used
to encrypt

131
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:32,320
the timestamp and so you can end up with
the fall

132
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:35,960
working Kerr Bros TGT for that user
without actually having

133
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:39,580
the password I'll and it also works with
the

134
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:43,320
excuse

135
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:48,850
I'll okay so I would find his keys I'll

136
00:08:48,850 --> 00:08:52,380
keys are both it Active Directory

137
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:56,480
and in the clients house aspirin i cant
find it as

138
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:59,950
use CRC 40 is what's getting the same

139
00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:04,150
as the and hash and depending on the
functional Italy

140
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:07,600
yes 26 keys what sweet sixties

141
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:11,760
also in memory as well a

142
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:15,380
what are the features to protect users
group does prevents

143
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:18,680
he's from being shipped else s memory

144
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:23,630
but they're still available on the DC
%uh

145
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:26,910
ES keys or used strong

146
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:30,100
PBK f2 area which

147
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:34,320
I hashing algorithm this is strong
complex

148
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:38,220
house younger than that anybody does
password cracking

149
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:41,270
the sashes its hashes usually

150
00:09:41,270 --> 00:09:44,620
cracked millions or billions per second
on modern hardware

151
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:48,930
the sashes Hortense per second all

152
00:09:48,930 --> 00:09:51,970
unfortunately these are still used as
possible

153
00:09:51,970 --> 00:09:55,600
reports for example with overpass to
hatch so

154
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:58,620
you still have a problem if you can
recover the key

155
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:01,640
just script type stepped away you go so

156
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:04,930
it's made it harder to recover the
original password but the end result is

157
00:10:04,930 --> 00:10:05,320
often

158
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:10,690
said what

159
00:10:10,690 --> 00:10:13,700

199
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:48,550
and secure the saw icky camp

200
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:52,279
maybe

201
00:12:52,279 --> 00:12:56,320
hoops

202
00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:02,180
a foot problem secure the site the key

207
00:13:21,709 --> 00:13:28,709
a is key elsa forties aggression on
throughout this key

208
00:13:32,949 --> 00:13:35,239
but so on choses qui you can go to the

209
00:13:35,239 --> 00:13:38,350
on those are much in because we have
like much in which is outside the

210
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:39,339
settlements

211
00:13:39,339 --> 00:13:46,339
which doesn't other in the access to the
domain controller

212
00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:01,690
to put it you

213
00:14:01,690 --> 00:14:08,690

them in

216
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:19,839
but no we'll use me cuts

217
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:26,839
to access just with its key okay

218
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:36,629
would command

219
00:14:36,629 --> 00:14:38,149
ok it's no barefoot

220
00:14:38,149 --> 00:14:42,249
mozhesh I'll in this July have no to
both tickets

221
00:14:42,249 --> 00:14:45,319
stein's because look for the moment they
haven't made that no excess

222
00:14:45,319 --> 00:14:50,290
and no in this journal I can access

223
00:14:50,290 --> 00:14:54,179
UNMIN don't know all the encontrado and
this time in the morning I have couple

224
00:14:54,179 --> 00:14:54,939
was tickets

225
00:14:54,939 --> 00:14:58,369
because I up injected arch in the
couple's provide

226
00:14:58,369 --> 00:15:05,040
up

227
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:09,620
just get back the most efficient

228
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:12,740
so up you up maybe other bolted this is
exactly

229
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:17,860
also a lot or book walks because that
the claim to the second chance the bus

230
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:21,990
while the of a user without knowing the
holdup us what the exactly it was the

231
00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:22,330
same

232
00:15:22,330 --> 00:15:27,180
they make over by the ash the injector a
the authenticate against the kitty

233
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:28,790
series a and Telemachus

234
00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:33,030
and the ask for the subs gotten inch of
Basra ok

235
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:37,320
so though would speak about buy the
tickets because all the buzz

236
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:41,360
touch which looks like exactly like but
such because in fact that the the same

237
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:42,100
this is Kate

238
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:45,540
in that as a South but as it gets is
only to be a difference

239
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:49,940
opposite to gets is it we do exactly the
same

240
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:53,970
us forty but we injects a TGT in LA sets
couple

241
00:15:53,970 --> 00:15:58,000
in it i think thats process for in the
cables provide so this time we don't let

242
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,270
us catch the KDC

243
00:15:59,270 --> 00:16:02,620
for TGT but we asked to QVC to give us

244
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:07,180
some TGS that we Walt for access
shareholders that whistles

245
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:10,800
but because also injects in that this
process

246
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:13,980
TGS because jesse is enough to access

247
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:17,370
but draw service but jess is not enough
to obtain

248
00:16:17,370 --> 00:16:21,540
up with deep although it is yes this is
a 1 usage

249
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:25,350
ok it begins its times well we confine

250
00:16:25,350 --> 00:16:28,960
is a %uh this dish indigenous as usual

251
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:33,120
confined its in SS minow at this at this
process is that we think you can find a

252
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,070
lot of data into

253
00:16:34,070 --> 00:16:37,690
on its value they will process because
Microsoft

254
00:16:37,690 --> 00:16:41,580
other a PI to expect this digits young
to just from memory

255
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:44,720
but it's limited by the fold for cook
for you all

256
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:47,920
own tickets so you cannot a access

257
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:51,720
shitty outages form also use those bitch
from expect you'll TGT

258
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:54,900
all Utes yup one exception

259
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:58,670
you can on the specialty GTE for 10
minutes what though up made some was

260
00:16:58,670 --> 00:16:59,970
just a chance to access

261
00:16:59,970 --> 00:17:03,300
visited some Java application need it so
you can find it in the life

262
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:07,089
okay but ever not know much was always
with a union minister though I'd

263
00:17:07,089 --> 00:17:10,130
up enough right to dump is all to shift
gets

264
00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:13,370
for my weapon double digits tickets on
solid what site

265
00:17:13,370 --> 00:17:17,330
so does animals out the idea of
Microsoft's

266
00:17:17,330 --> 00:17:18,240
a new gun

267
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:22,550
use man gets cum on two lists on about
the tickets with official because of the

268
00:17:22,550 --> 00:17:23,250
pit a PI

269
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:26,630
it's not arch all Ortiz the commodity on
the cause of

270
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:29,950
what sites okay that's good

271
00:17:29,950 --> 00:17:33,670
gone the next what you onto gets butts
if you are black at the cats

272
00:17:33,670 --> 00:17:36,800
some people if make been that so you
want to access

273
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:41,419
all that is shitty on although it is yes
it's not

274
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:45,460
exactly the same week we cannot use IP
four that's but we gonna use memo you

275
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:48,630
leading of siss with memo eating

276
00:17:48,630 --> 00:17:51,810
the Nexus all that on with as we can

277
00:17:51,810 --> 00:17:55,920
with ultimately we can access all
session key in the process process

278
00:17:55,920 --> 00:18:01,010
so its also in cats when it gets a gun
secret with secret that he gets a

279
00:18:01,010 --> 00:18:04,490
exports you can expect all the tickets
the if this persists

280
00:18:04,490 --> 00:18:08,280
up in memory and you can use any of
these tickets with two doors

281
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:12,110
as it gets Commons against like the
Magic's

282
00:18:12,110 --> 00:18:15,180
make a little demonstration maybe if
item

283
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:20,210
use my miles

284
00:18:20,210 --> 00:18:23,970
ok

285
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:27,249
so on Windows woo who

286
00:18:27,249 --> 00:18:31,740
who Windows we just closed position
because

287
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:35,240
it we flush all gets

288
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:42,240
on memory 0

289
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:49,990
on would go back to the station okay

290
00:18:49,990 --> 00:18:54,130
decision we have access we have seen
that we have keys in the movie

291
00:18:54,130 --> 00:19:01,130
but maybe we don't up to gets we have
tickets

292
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:10,180
for these retry to expect or the bus
tickets

293
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:20,380
okay there is a lot of tickets on this
as this process because

294
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:24,930
ever the the computer icons also used to
get swell

295
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:29,220
to make a authentication so able to
fight him i text optional

296
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:32,820
I must choose those a good one it would
be very difficult hope with the screen

297
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:36,990
sites we would make up so so

298
00:19:36,990 --> 00:19:40,170
just for you I we use

299
00:19:40,170 --> 00:19:45,530
secure BT GT fight fun is what the
because it's okay to the liquid couldn't

300
00:19:45,530 --> 00:19:52,530
so we've got the best its what site
leave him

301
00:19:56,110 --> 00:20:00,919
its law we like

302
00:20:00,919 --> 00:20:07,049
and we go back him up

303
00:20:07,049 --> 00:20:10,860
and we will work you so it's good

304
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:15,039
so again look we are on the a question
on this site much in love

305
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:19,740
no access to saddam in total because
this is a special

306
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:23,039
machine what mean no no no access denied

307
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:30,039
okay the problems boss bus

308
00:20:30,919 --> 00:20:35,539
that tickets can it would like to book

309
00:20:35,539 --> 00:20:39,470

310
00:20:39,470 --> 00:20:45,029

313
00:20:56,360 --> 00:21:00,190
because of its serbs because it's but
she ought

314
00:21:00,190 --> 00:21:05,549
ok let's go back

315
00:21:05,549 --> 00:21:12,549
presentation

316
00:21:15,850 --> 00:21:19,610
alright so we had this little chart here
it's got a lot of

317
00:21:19,610 --> 00:21:23,140
information and no we're not gonna go
over everything right now

318
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:26,910
we will get the sluts Post online I
after the talk

319
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:31,810
I'll so there is a lot of really good
information here

320
00:21:31,810 --> 00:21:35,910
that have pushed Saudi feel free to hit
us up at some point other one thing I

321
00:21:35,910 --> 00:21:37,210
would like to point out is

322
00:21:37,210 --> 00:21:41,760
the want to cause things is we counted
the number of times you had to touch

323
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:46,300
KTC depending on which one of these
attacks using aunt

324
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:49,780
a so with the if you were able to get a
tatt

325
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:53,780
he is a past ticket you only have to
touch the TGS to get a service ticket

326
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:58,540
%uh she'll service ticket you can just
go directly to the service

327
00:21:58,540 --> 00:22:02,300
and what we're about to talk about the
Golden Tickets

328
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:05,450
are you only it they behave just like a
TGT

329
00:22:05,450 --> 00:22:09,240
so you only have touched you only have
to talk to the case TGS

330
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:15,140
right golden tickets

331
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:18,490
so the golden ticket

332
00:22:18,490 --> 00:22:24,000
is a homemade ticket it's made with a
lot of love and icky

333
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,360
of its not made by the KTC

334
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:31,340
so you're not beholden to any other GPO
settings

335
00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:35,580
he could put pretty much whatever you
want side and magic things happen

336
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:39,210
I and its smart card independent as well

337
00:22:39,210 --> 00:22:43,600
so

338
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:46,440
%uh a lot of people are focused on the
golden ticket

339
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:51,870
featured many cats with the 10-year life
10-year life span that's been hard coded

340
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:54,950
that's not really the most interesting
thing about the

341
00:22:54,950 --> 00:22:58,430
the golden ticket stuff and you can go
change the default the source codes

342
00:22:58,430 --> 00:22:59,160
available

343
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:02,480
go change 10 years to whatever you want
it to be

344
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:06,880
the most interesting part is that since
we have to curb TGT

345
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:09,930
we can now go through and modify the
stuff

346
00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:13,680
in the pack such as a group membership

347
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:20,000
sit his name at cetera et cetera a
Kerberos

348
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:25,200
stateless so all of the information that
you need to be able to access

349
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:30,170
service has to be contained inside a TGT
including stuff like whether or not the

350
00:23:30,170 --> 00:23:31,960
account is enabled or disabled

351
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:36,700
I whether or not the county's inside or
outside logon hours

352
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:40,960
whether it up passwords about to expire
or the account is expired

353
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:44,170
its members any authentication silos

354
00:23:44,170 --> 00:23:48,350
a if it's a member of the project users
to simply

355
00:23:48,350 --> 00:23:52,040
another group that is listed in the pack

356
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:56,900
so if you to have someone in the
protected users group that you're

357
00:23:56,900 --> 00:24:00,790
attempting to do something with their
account you can simply not include the

358
00:24:00,790 --> 00:24:05,670
protected Users group you don't have to
worry about it Ahmed group membership

359
00:24:05,670 --> 00:24:07,140
ligaments is also the pack

360
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:10,550
this sexually means that everything is
client-side

361
00:24:10,550 --> 00:24:14,930
enforcement at this point because you're
presenting own a

362
00:24:14,930 --> 00:24:18,350
version ok what account policy you want
to enforce

363
00:24:18,350 --> 00:24:22,770
get service tickets because you're not
supposed to have the TGT

364
00:24:22,770 --> 00:24:26,440
the central key for all trust or the

365
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:29,770
purchase Department up so

366
00:24:29,770 --> 00:24:34,690
by default the MIT Kerberos 5 just not
have any mechanisms

367
00:24:34,690 --> 00:24:37,980
by which a the TGS skin

368
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:41,270
validate that account his not disable

369
00:24:41,270 --> 00:24:44,800
or outside logon hours anything I'll

370
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:48,300
because that is supposed to be handled
by the TGT

371
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:52,000
you're not supposed to TGT if you're
disabled or whatever

372
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,790
so because we're presenting ballot issue

373
00:24:54,790 --> 00:24:58,200
tease Microsoft added a this is

374
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:01,240
a feature that is in the Microsoft first
Kerr Bros

375
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:05,590
I where if the ticket is older than 20
minutes

376
00:25:05,590 --> 00:25:09,160
the key to the TGS will go back
invalidate

377
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:13,700
when issuing new service tickets whether
or not the account is still valid for

378
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:19,210
whatever reason so I gives us 20 minute
window to do whatever we want I'll

379
00:25:19,210 --> 00:25:22,550
and because we control our own TGT is
weakened always

380
00:25:22,550 --> 00:25:25,620
refreshed a Chitty Chitty all

381
00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:29,340
come back to that in a minute although I
think people can see where this is going

382
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:33,270
all thusly we focus on creating

383
00:25:33,270 --> 00:25:38,370
with the golden ticket about fake TGT is
because you only need to curb TGT

384
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:38,840
Italian

385
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:42,080
to encrypt sign ok a little bits

386
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:45,170
if we could do the service tickets

387
00:25:45,170 --> 00:25:49,590
look pretty much exactly the same as
CiCi's the problem is that you have to

388
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:50,760
have different keys

389
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:53,820
those keys change periodically serbs

390
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:58,570
computer accounts automatically rotate I
believe it's every 30 to 45 days

391
00:25:58,570 --> 00:26:03,620
up wheres be talked about previously the
curb chee chee chee account never really

392
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:07,350
roles normal environment so if your
cover it

393
00:26:07,350 --> 00:26:12,590
you're good for a very long time and you
can use a TGT to get multiple TGS

394
00:26:12,590 --> 00:26:17,070
so let's go technical

395
00:26:17,070 --> 00:26:20,320
so all units fall building

396
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:23,380
your all golden ticket is went in to get

397
00:26:23,380 --> 00:26:26,680
is though pretty shitty key gunby

398
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:30,410
and said mr. shit on me a yes evangi
even this issue of its

399
00:26:30,410 --> 00:26:34,630
ok it's you also needs a SAT of the
demand it's not a sick which made

400
00:26:34,630 --> 00:26:39,260
its pública on that owns a demand on
the beach with what my peers get faded

401
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:42,320
moccasin it's all the same places on the
domain name

402
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:47,130
talk with one come on gone complete bust
is gone they will not not to do it

403
00:26:47,130 --> 00:26:51,370
invents you can up secure BGT keys Sauza

404
00:26:51,370 --> 00:26:55,380
this is the st4 key for cavities I S key

405
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:58,940
a No on out with all that's you can quit

406
00:26:58,940 --> 00:27:02,710
you on golden tickets with this but
should I come online this is the easy

407
00:27:02,710 --> 00:27:04,169
you can put saddam in them

408
00:27:04,169 --> 00:27:07,259
SAT's ACI's so you to use on them you
want to be

409
00:27:07,259 --> 00:27:11,249
the ID of the user name salt five and
what is the weight no

410
00:27:11,249 --> 00:27:14,480
a be the of the minute news with over to
compute which wants

411
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:18,489
a new on Yukon boots all corpse such
want to use though

412
00:27:18,489 --> 00:27:21,639
combi long the choice not the kiddies

413
00:27:21,639 --> 00:27:24,700
okay a new.com bush is that the in the
fight

414
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:28,279
a new gone though he was a fight that
those in one yes two wheels

415
00:27:28,279 --> 00:27:31,509
it walks okay so what

416
00:27:31,509 --> 00:27:37,279
welcome you will what we do with his
golden tickets with his golden tickets

417
00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:41,009
i waltz a burden to get rich is buddy
that at Danielle's because they looked

418
00:27:41,009 --> 00:27:42,820
and yes I think it's in the full

419
00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:48,809
dentist the a lot of but that's okay

420
00:27:48,809 --> 00:27:54,139
which on with this button to get I want
to be a news photo I want to be in doing

421
00:27:54,139 --> 00:27:56,720
that means for the pope's I want a lot
of fights because

422
00:27:56,720 --> 00:28:00,049
it's a golden ticket okay so in the
future in the

423
00:28:00,049 --> 00:28:03,190
next to my question a win makes a good
and to get for nothing

424
00:28:03,190 --> 00:28:07,399
for dominance at all but that's not all
because we're crazy people

425
00:28:07,399 --> 00:28:10,879
we want we want to access only mod chip

426
00:28:10,879 --> 00:28:14,090
when Owens though he was a is delivered
saw

427
00:28:14,090 --> 00:28:18,299
in the life nobody can access to this
show but with the gold and

428
00:28:18,299 --> 00:28:22,049
we so good and to get wood crates a fake
tickets

429
00:28:22,049 --> 00:28:25,460
which she in fact is that the tickets
from full to demand

430
00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:29,149
oil it's a it's a normal account which
is not feasible at this time on we will

431
00:28:29,149 --> 00:28:29,690
push

432
00:28:29,690 --> 00:28:33,749
in the pope but so the tickets the ID
other users which is

433
00:28:33,749 --> 00:28:36,929
know but it is about because the futile

434
00:28:36,929 --> 00:28:42,179
on the SAT would be able to access to
the ship Evan after 20 minutes

435
00:28:42,179 --> 00:28:45,879
on because we have twenty people to

436
00:28:45,879 --> 00:28:50,869
with quits a a good into gets for news
that which is not in the demand

437
00:28:50,869 --> 00:28:55,220
doesn't exist exists on with the ID
which is not in the lumen

438
00:28:55,220 --> 00:28:58,259
to until it will between walks

439
00:28:58,259 --> 00:29:02,119
wisdom and admin whites okay ok it's all

440
00:29:02,119 --> 00:29:06,739
that doesn't that don't exist so even
though he's old ID so the TGT we'll

441
00:29:06,739 --> 00:29:10,679
on the wall for 20 minutes butts I hope
that all people

442
00:29:10,679 --> 00:29:15,249
EF component demanding twenty minutes
okay I think it's enough

443
00:29:15,249 --> 00:29:19,190
on even if it's not enough in 20 minutes
you up enough time to obtain

444
00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:22,190
many GS 450 much a half to exit

445
00:29:22,190 --> 00:29:25,730
for Macbeth exec of things like that
onto the mental total on

446
00:29:25,730 --> 00:29:28,960
these digits will be vetted than our so
you have time

447
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:33,989
okay on even if it's not enough because
you of slope into stuff maybe they don't

448
00:29:33,989 --> 00:29:34,320
look

449
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:37,679
ok it not all so

450
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:40,820
with problems close

451
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:43,830
you as a couple or skate so even after
20 minutes

452
00:29:43,830 --> 00:29:47,340
you can creates another look button to
get for on the twenty minutes

453
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:50,629
it's very good because this when you use

454
00:29:50,629 --> 00:29:54,749
a butt guy tickets what's easy to use on
them in the oven plug

455
00:29:54,749 --> 00:29:58,480
what is the ID in the butt plug you can
search

456
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:01,869
it doesn't exist ok it

457
00:30:01,869 --> 00:30:05,749
or that is crazy so I we try to make a
demonstration the boats distributes

458
00:30:05,749 --> 00:30:06,210
Goodell

459
00:30:06,210 --> 00:30:12,190
gays so again this time so we go back to
cease mission

460
00:30:12,190 --> 00:30:15,320
but we look of to it was all that up

461
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:22,320
and pick up

462
00:30:25,110 --> 00:30:27,750
we deal it's my old fight because I'm
not a cheater

463
00:30:27,750 --> 00:30:30,750
okay ha so

464
00:30:30,750 --> 00:30:35,559
again access denied I'll lurch but like
them

465
00:30:35,559 --> 00:30:42,559
I'm a lucky guy and we could keep us to
make on okay you

466
00:30:46,839 --> 00:30:49,690
ok it on this is a police opened the
still

467
00:30:49,690 --> 00:30:53,519
about the previous commander of many got
suckered into gets pushed the ticket in

468
00:30:53,519 --> 00:30:54,070
the fight

469
00:30:54,070 --> 00:30:57,179
but I over included a new commands
slashed

470
00:30:57,179 --> 00:31:01,449
by the up but the to get at the and the
command which credit to get

471
00:31:01,449 --> 00:31:06,419
directly memory so you can have more
time to ultimate to make exploits okay

472
00:31:06,419 --> 00:31:13,419
so at this time by other tickets new
gets ok if they have it

473
00:31:14,209 --> 00:31:17,649
ever TGT fall unease with or I have
created that

474
00:31:17,649 --> 00:31:21,079
only with the with the kilby TGT

475
00:31:21,079 --> 00:31:25,049
antenna March so it's pretty good

476
00:31:25,049 --> 00:31:28,919
on because will Windows guy

477
00:31:28,919 --> 00:31:35,919
sometime with white what's that out to
do it do it some tough or make remote

478
00:31:36,699 --> 00:31:37,539
administration

479
00:31:37,539 --> 00:31:40,979
because I'll so is know on the shelf
open test

480
00:31:40,979 --> 00:31:45,089
all

481
00:31:45,089 --> 00:31:48,679
slow to do this time I can access

482
00:31:48,679 --> 00:31:52,659
mean and a new jail again and they can
makes

483
00:31:52,659 --> 00:31:56,699
administration made a min because with
on the circuit is it the ostriches

484
00:31:56,699 --> 00:32:00,129
if boats ten years ago I'm again

485
00:32:00,129 --> 00:32:07,129
the men in minnesota but

486
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:10,200
I think it's normal psalm thats do

487
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:14,430
for key okay this time

488
00:32:14,430 --> 00:32:17,770
I would create a fake sure the but
because we are demonstration

489
00:32:17,770 --> 00:32:24,010
I make frankly that up in the tickets
weekend

490
00:32:24,010 --> 00:32:27,550
use so Evan if we r

491
00:32:27,550 --> 00:32:30,590
domain admin this what though for this
time we have

492
00:32:30,590 --> 00:32:34,340
a particular show that we cannot access

493
00:32:34,340 --> 00:32:38,190
its tests oxygenated these icons

494
00:32:38,190 --> 00:32:42,050
I want to access on the court which is
desirable on the a negative do it to it

495
00:32:42,050 --> 00:32:43,320
okay

496
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:50,320
which are you to okay

497
00:32:52,270 --> 00:32:56,360
you is account is disabled maybe you see
because me I'd concede

498
00:32:56,360 --> 00:33:00,000
but this account is disabled sorry 32
miss the mark on its

499
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:04,630
so nobody I cultures it's so

500
00:33:04,630 --> 00:33:07,710
will look of again because this is
Windows

501
00:33:07,710 --> 00:33:11,430
the couple's just come on the

502
00:33:11,430 --> 00:33:18,430
is is not available so it

503
00:33:20,950 --> 00:33:22,509
so

504
00:33:22,509 --> 00:33:24,940
I access denied again and again

505
00:33:24,940 --> 00:33:28,879
but we create

506
00:33:28,879 --> 00:33:33,899
the golden ticket wouldn't get full

507
00:33:33,899 --> 00:33:38,120
those so this time a used silver shali

508
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:41,440
the law accounts this is the DCI
accounts

509
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:44,460
but I F push in these tickets

510
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:49,070
the ID absurdity that the upon which is
a bird

511
00:33:49,070 --> 00:33:52,539
ok it this time it's in it's in the
final

512
00:33:52,539 --> 00:33:56,370
what's up not a problem we have the
Commons to pass it to get rich by

513
00:33:56,370 --> 00:34:03,370
to you already know it okay

514
00:34:06,710 --> 00:34:10,500
so this time I am a domain controller
all

515
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:15,120
was all gone this is not a poem's butts
I can access

516
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:22,120
a news show with a Nikon which is doable

517
00:34:26,990 --> 00:34:29,320
22 walks in 20 minutes to

518
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:33,060
even though even though it to watch
local because of the chicks that shitty

519
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:40,060
again with us I love you know on this
time

520
00:34:43,869 --> 00:34:47,020
with weights the bug guy both so

521
00:34:47,020 --> 00:34:51,230
because well on the most russian the but
they would be named

522
00:34:51,230 --> 00:34:58,230
Morgan

523
00:34:58,590 --> 00:35:01,020
you but before

524
00:35:01,020 --> 00:35:04,270
doing it its I would make littered short
for you

525
00:35:04,270 --> 00:35:07,880
I we'll deal its

526
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:10,880
so security security box

527
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:17,880
the fourth so it I don't get it up

528
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:28,480
able only does the security log for
showing up for showing you

529
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:34,630
after what's his which is it into okay
and and the question

530
00:35:34,630 --> 00:35:38,700
week rates another tickets

531
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:42,960
so systems acquitted to go for use on
them and more gun which doesn't exist

532
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:47,980
and saw them into the men I'll two
crates on with a news ID which is the

533
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:49,369
maximum also the world

534
00:35:49,369 --> 00:35:53,430
doesn't exist at all onto the man butts
we have a group

535
00:35:53,430 --> 00:35:56,930
fall demand in Minnesota ok it

536
00:35:56,930 --> 00:36:03,930
the two is that these tickets

537
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:13,840
tease but gay ok

538
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:20,840
okay nope we are

539
00:36:21,170 --> 00:36:25,700
so will Mogan which is a very bad day on
the doesn't exists

540
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:29,760
into the men but is but guy

541
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:35,150
the Nexus I mean that I'll again under
the mint on

542
00:36:35,150 --> 00:36:38,830
what's active do it we have seen about
about its it

543
00:36:38,830 --> 00:36:45,830
don't think I will omit on my screen
because it's very little

544
00:36:53,010 --> 00:36:54,180
and

545
00:36:54,180 --> 00:36:57,310
the KTC only see that more gun one texas
the mental

546
00:36:57,310 --> 00:37:01,710
on the up even yet yes the developed
expertise yes

547
00:37:01,710 --> 00:37:05,910
to Morgan which doesn't exist in
settlements on the modem connects its

548
00:37:05,910 --> 00:37:09,540
all that the like a demand and subtle
for 20 minutes butts

549
00:37:09,540 --> 00:37:12,870
if you want econ wishing that it's been
that's digiti

550
00:37:12,870 --> 00:37:17,340
in 20 minutes it's a it's going thank
you which wants to other JavaScript

551
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:20,390
into %uh the is on them you gonna love

552
00:37:20,390 --> 00:37:27,390
only support in with some solution
become condition okay

553
00:37:27,770 --> 00:37:30,900
sorts so so yeah it was the last

554
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:35,640
the most efficient of but the

555
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:39,900
I'm pretty sure summer some people are
here official a book about

556
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:46,900
thank you very much for your attention

557
00:37:55,849 --> 00:38:00,309
alright guys so there's my care if you
have further questions for sin will %uh

558
00:38:00,309 --> 00:38:03,720
do our best to hits them or

559
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:08,440
deflect them is necessary a very

560
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:12,119
your

561
00:38:12,119 --> 00:38:16,980
nope so Microsoft

562
00:38:16,980 --> 00:38:21,359
Microsoft to say this is not a broken
SSO model but what I i'm sorry it's took

563
00:38:21,359 --> 00:38:22,130
it very very well

564
00:38:22,130 --> 00:38:25,499
can you hear me now yeah so Microsoft
contains are

565
00:38:25,499 --> 00:38:28,920
says this is not a broken ass is so
model but basically

566
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:31,940
we are seeing it is you believe they're
gonna fix this or

567
00:38:31,940 --> 00:38:35,529
all well status of this so

568
00:38:35,529 --> 00:38:39,160
there's a couple both issues its a

569
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:42,259
could make this a little better a

570
00:38:42,259 --> 00:38:46,049
the ability to automatically roll the
curb TGT account not have

571
00:38:46,049 --> 00:38:49,480
ballot for 10-plus years or whatever

572
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:53,769
arm I know there's people that are
trying to figure out the best way of

573
00:38:53,769 --> 00:38:54,319
doing that

574
00:38:54,319 --> 00:38:59,989
at Microsoft right now I'll and they're
also working on coming up with a

575
00:38:59,989 --> 00:39:01,319
consistent message

576
00:39:01,319 --> 00:39:05,650
on the appropriate steps to take to
change to curb TGT is part of

577
00:39:05,650 --> 00:39:08,710
whatever process you want to use but

578
00:39:08,710 --> 00:39:12,069
the bottom line is that Kerberos it was

579
00:39:12,069 --> 00:39:16,700
swat at those was never really designed
to do necessarily what is currently

580
00:39:16,700 --> 00:39:17,160
doing

581
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:20,640
it was designed around lessening

582
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:23,950
authentication traffic that's flying
across the wire twenty-something years

583
00:39:23,950 --> 00:39:24,430
ago

584
00:39:24,430 --> 00:39:28,390
om and not necessarily decide for

585
00:39:28,390 --> 00:39:32,710
today's modern security sort of thing in
one of the fundamental problems with

586
00:39:32,710 --> 00:39:33,549
Kerberos is

587
00:39:33,549 --> 00:39:37,059
always been if you lose the KTC you're
totally hosed

588
00:39:37,059 --> 00:39:40,940
I'll this is just basically taking that

589
00:39:40,940 --> 00:39:45,019
to its logical conclusion being able to
create arbitrary users

590
00:39:45,019 --> 00:39:48,119
that don't exist and access services

591
00:39:48,119 --> 00:39:52,690
as these these users so I'll

592
00:39:52,690 --> 00:39:56,789
there some solutions that can be
implemented that are being worked on to

593
00:39:56,789 --> 00:39:58,900
try to fix some other stuff but

594
00:39:58,900 --> 00:40:04,460
unfortunately right now the best vices
don't lose the domain I'll

595
00:40:04,460 --> 00:40:05,760
and that is so

596
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:10,530
us always sort of been the going advice
sir

597
00:40:10,530 --> 00:40:15,030
how would you rate the all the keys
directly from else s memory at some

598
00:40:15,030 --> 00:40:15,570
point

599
00:40:15,570 --> 00:40:20,220
but what about the protection mechanisms
that Microsoft implemented in

600
00:40:20,220 --> 00:40:23,550
8 8.1 2012 hott 22

601
00:40:23,550 --> 00:40:26,940
to prevent thats coat just the

602
00:40:26,940 --> 00:40:30,050
redirected from the Asus memory alright
I'll

603
00:40:30,050 --> 00:40:37,050
Benjamin answer that one

604
00:40:39,650 --> 00:40:41,319
the Julia Anderson or division

605
00:40:41,319 --> 00:40:44,890
very good but a given dust

606
00:40:44,890 --> 00:40:48,720
understood just sayin will speak about
windows hates one

607
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:53,550
predicted results yes just a in this
particular case that when you was a TGT

608
00:40:53,550 --> 00:40:58,000
I a a yes of for cheap aluminum minutes
but the heart not

609
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:03,530
minimally got .tk on the bodies for
follow us follow orders of on dunno else

610
00:41:03,530 --> 00:41:05,109
will see demand at Minnesota

611
00:41:05,109 --> 00:41:08,540
a a the whole of comiskey

612
00:41:08,540 --> 00:41:11,859
you missed the you must provide robust
both to obtain

613
00:41:11,859 --> 00:41:15,130
a new key to obtain a nudist but

614
00:41:15,130 --> 00:41:18,849
he was up there was key on this but
today cheese butts

615
00:41:18,849 --> 00:41:22,369
that's not all but because the 80 S key
but not

616
00:41:22,369 --> 00:41:25,410
urged week on stowed to teach the given
for protected Ruth

617
00:41:25,410 --> 00:41:32,410
just looking on the

618
00:41:32,430 --> 00:41:35,619
offensive security website talking about
how this that it

619
00:41:35,619 --> 00:41:40,480
1.0 Metasploit by your accident talking
about how you have to

620
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:43,609
well packed des moines are you going to
be putting

621
00:41:43,609 --> 00:41:47,819
tupelo no package minutes available a

622
00:41:47,819 --> 00:41:52,050
that fairly confident some point that's
going to happen I think it's just one of

623
00:41:52,050 --> 00:41:52,819
those things

624
00:41:52,819 --> 00:41:56,579
its we're not the ones that maintain
that particular piece

625
00:41:56,579 --> 00:42:01,920
up things um and so the functionality
everyone was using

626
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:06,770
is primarily based off the 1.0 but I
believe very soon they'll probably get

627
00:42:06,770 --> 00:42:07,599
that update it

628
00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:12,500
a more recent version hi

629
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:15,520
but to brave it pay it back to you
values on: swear

630
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:20,089
when you say do not use domain do you
mean local accounts are more secure

631
00:42:20,089 --> 00:42:23,589
or use a there is and our protocol

632
00:42:23,589 --> 00:42:27,130
which is more skill than characters now
though

633
00:42:27,130 --> 00:42:30,470
the problem is it we're sort of reaching
a point

634
00:42:30,470 --> 00:42:34,589
worker process really showing its age
how many things

635
00:42:34,589 --> 00:42:38,280
in a your daily job for twenty years old

636
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:41,680
and stole functioning properly I'll

637
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:45,969
so unfortunately you have to

638
00:42:45,969 --> 00:42:49,630
you have to dance with the girl he came
with so

639
00:42:49,630 --> 00:42:53,659
you you know

640
00:42:53,659 --> 00:42:58,579
its you year you're invested you have a
domain yet thousands of users

641
00:42:58,579 --> 00:43:02,089
you've been doing it this way if you
decide to Mar you want to do something

642
00:43:02,089 --> 00:43:02,849
else that's

643
00:43:02,849 --> 00:43:08,079
not something idk it just stop doing it
right now it's the best thing out there

644
00:43:08,079 --> 00:43:11,609
and us the priority should be preventing

645
00:43:11,609 --> 00:43:14,630
people for being able to top the ashes
in the first place

646
00:43:14,630 --> 00:43:17,779
while other medications technique sir

647
00:43:17,779 --> 00:43:21,549
about being developed I'll unfortunately

648
00:43:21,549 --> 00:43:27,019
today you know you kinda screwed if you
have an FG don't from 10 years ago

649
00:43:27,019 --> 00:43:30,489
you're potentially screw I'll

650
00:43:30,489 --> 00:43:33,609
you know if you had a pen tester 10
years ago where the doctor hashes that

651
00:43:33,609 --> 00:43:36,009
curb TGT account could still be lives

652
00:43:36,009 --> 00:43:39,609
so there's you know it's

653
00:43:39,609 --> 00:43:43,419
its unfortunate that's where we are
right now I'll

654
00:43:43,419 --> 00:43:50,419
but it is what it is thanks the problem
have you done any experiments with

655
00:43:51,789 --> 00:43:55,859
protected process light home for
protecting else s memory reading

656
00:43:55,859 --> 00:44:02,169
and if so it doesn't make any difference
at all it detected process late

657
00:44:02,169 --> 00:44:07,329
school just me it sorry it's called
protected process light it something

658
00:44:07,329 --> 00:44:08,130
with them

659
00:44:08,130 --> 00:44:11,509
when those 8.1 protesters turned on a
light

660
00:44:11,509 --> 00:44:15,619
per protect process will be better yes
%uh the book but the process with all

661
00:44:15,619 --> 00:44:16,189
the time

662
00:44:16,189 --> 00:44:19,679
to present it but I have also created
apply for

663
00:44:19,679 --> 00:44:22,889
me gots on this but struck by a book on
Patch

664
00:44:22,889 --> 00:44:24,080
a

665
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:31,080
the structure up the process to when
projects suppose

666
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:34,220
hi

667
00:44:34,220 --> 00:44:37,609
and thank you for a great presentation
and was a great tool

668
00:44:37,609 --> 00:44:41,090
as well a but I would like to expand on
the previous question about

669
00:44:41,090 --> 00:44:44,410
using local administrators or just me my
sincere

670
00:44:44,410 --> 00:44:48,010
presence of is also keen accounts

671
00:44:48,010 --> 00:44:51,460
on and points or other machine so am

672
00:44:51,460 --> 00:44:55,820
there will be a presentation later about
it about exposure to pass the house but

673
00:44:55,820 --> 00:45:00,170
in generally if and alls administrative
tasks or

674
00:45:00,170 --> 00:45:04,109
majority of administrative task are done
with local accounts always

675
00:45:04,109 --> 00:45:07,530
it segmented or zoned accounts

676
00:45:07,530 --> 00:45:13,340
we'll cease be an effective mitigation
your print um

677
00:45:13,340 --> 00:45:16,630
a lot of that is just going to come down
to so many

678
00:45:16,630 --> 00:45:19,710
artillery things I'll

679
00:45:19,710 --> 00:45:23,260
for example do you have a backup of
order to make

680
00:45:23,260 --> 00:45:26,840
stroller sitting on a hard drive
somewhere that is

681
00:45:26,840 --> 00:45:29,869
unprotected are the backup tapes
scripted

682
00:45:29,869 --> 00:45:33,660
I'll it like I said is there a pen test
report

683
00:45:33,660 --> 00:45:37,480
from 10 years ago that shows the that
they demonstrated

684
00:45:37,480 --> 00:45:40,990
where they top the ashes where they
didn't obscure the QWERTY GTS cash

685
00:45:40,990 --> 00:45:42,710
because I didn't know what to do with it

686
00:45:42,710 --> 00:45:45,750
up segmenting it's always good

687
00:45:45,750 --> 00:45:49,710
there's always best business practices
to raise the bar I'll

688
00:45:49,710 --> 00:45:52,980
monitoring a for access

689
00:45:52,980 --> 00:45:56,390
auditing the best blogs such a lot
collection all the stuff you

690
00:45:56,390 --> 00:45:59,580
supposed to be doing anyway up

691
00:45:59,580 --> 00:46:02,770
minimizing exposure to the
administrative functions with local

692
00:46:02,770 --> 00:46:03,700
administrators

693
00:46:03,700 --> 00:46:07,420
minimizing number up to me that this you
know you don't have to have

694
00:46:07,420 --> 00:46:10,609
everybody in the domain adventure for
enterprise at Minsk Group

695
00:46:10,609 --> 00:46:15,060
or even a group that has something close
to those levels

696
00:46:15,060 --> 00:46:18,510
rights I'll all that stuff is it good

697
00:46:18,510 --> 00:46:21,930
best business practice to try to
minimize

698
00:46:21,930 --> 00:46:25,650
the effect but ultimately if you lose
the KTC

699
00:46:25,650 --> 00:46:28,900
your your you toast so

700
00:46:28,900 --> 00:46:32,310
everything should be focused on trying
not to lose KTC

701
00:46:32,310 --> 00:46:35,720
said the cassette you have to think
about backup shift

702
00:46:35,720 --> 00:46:40,359
think about file shares you have to
think about how you manage passwords

703
00:46:40,359 --> 00:46:43,390
in the system there's so many factors

704
00:46:43,390 --> 00:46:46,769
it a pen tester can use or adversary

705
00:46:46,769 --> 00:46:49,960
actual adversary can use to can access

706
00:46:49,960 --> 00:46:55,339
think I believe you read

707
00:46:55,339 --> 00:46:58,460
skis from from memory of declines sites

708
00:46:58,460 --> 00:47:01,559
some you if you like to do worse because

709
00:47:01,559 --> 00:47:04,869
will close you you read keys from

710
00:47:04,869 --> 00:47:08,900
from memory on the client side you
clarify

711
00:47:08,900 --> 00:47:11,989
when the skis are Press its what's
broken

712
00:47:11,989 --> 00:47:17,759
preconditions terror on

713
00:47:17,759 --> 00:47:20,880
inside the keys are on the president's
on the in

714
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:24,239
LSI sis process in the in fact

715
00:47:24,239 --> 00:47:28,470
Microsoft stall a a lot of that %uh each
provider for the whole

716
00:47:28,470 --> 00:47:31,609
NewsEdge wasn't pointed them touched

717
00:47:31,609 --> 00:47:35,049
stalled by hemisphere 102 I'll for

718
00:47:35,049 --> 00:47:39,309
for couples over it though stole a yes
Tedeschi

719
00:47:39,309 --> 00:47:42,660
a4 key even bus will sometimes unclear

720
00:47:42,660 --> 00:47:46,880
pincode small so there was a lot of key

721
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:50,630
generals boy so pretty much

722
00:47:50,630 --> 00:47:54,390
always fights schism pretty much always

723
00:47:54,390 --> 00:48:01,390
every client's sequiturs

724
00:48:04,519 --> 00:48:04,819
is

725
00:48:04,819 --> 00:48:08,890
0 not always and in the case of
protected Rizzo

726
00:48:08,890 --> 00:48:12,410
you'll on the fight TGT a TGS

727
00:48:12,410 --> 00:48:19,410
on some time been good its

728
00:48:23,359 --> 00:48:25,339
if you take at gym traditions

729
00:48:25,339 --> 00:48:29,489
fewer tax a he never environment where

730
00:48:29,489 --> 00:48:33,109
a domain setup with the forests was
marked for domains

731
00:48:33,109 --> 00:48:36,670
and you could asked for Cici that we
crunch

732
00:48:36,670 --> 00:48:40,599
a 30 texas' to pose other means

733
00:48:40,599 --> 00:48:46,170
in that forests using the Trust's I'll

734
00:48:46,170 --> 00:48:49,410
I know it's something that we've talked
about I have not actually played with

735
00:48:49,410 --> 00:48:51,109
that but I believe he his

736
00:48:51,109 --> 00:48:54,259
the it depends on the relationship

737
00:48:54,259 --> 00:48:57,359
but since you have a good and tickets on
the dominant system in

738
00:48:57,359 --> 00:49:01,130
stressed that as other men's to God and
to get them used to obtain

739
00:49:01,130 --> 00:49:04,900
on those ups shitty so the men on some
things results yes

740
00:49:04,900 --> 00:49:08,939
but this feature is not me its
influential

741
00:49:08,939 --> 00:49:12,459
gets yes the future is not set in Canton
Jets

742
00:49:12,459 --> 00:49:17,029
sorry sorry the future is not shit
implemented

743
00:49:17,029 --> 00:49:20,579
me gets 0 it looked good until you could
put

744
00:49:20,579 --> 00:49:24,549
what you want since I saw shoemaker good
that get to assess

745
00:49:24,549 --> 00:49:27,749
the unsubtle on the

746
00:49:27,749 --> 00:49:32,009
all on sort forests good news is good
and it gets nobody in Windows

747
00:49:32,009 --> 00:49:36,209
when you accessed were to a ship those
other men this is a couple's claims of

748
00:49:36,209 --> 00:49:36,819
we know that

749
00:49:36,819 --> 00:49:40,499
we lost that with us also shitty on the
city gets

750
00:49:40,499 --> 00:49:44,539
I'd buckled up to but its okay so it's
just a matter of

751
00:49:44,539 --> 00:49:47,900
interesting do rights domain ID's

752
00:49:47,900 --> 00:49:52,059
when you request your ticket right he'll
have to put the right domain

753
00:49:52,059 --> 00:49:56,119
yup that's right to Maine said and all
that and then when you create a new GGG

754
00:49:56,119 --> 00:49:56,699
for

755
00:49:56,699 --> 00:50:02,369
for that you can't do it that way or if
you're in like a parrot you can create a

756
00:50:02,369 --> 00:50:03,529
TGT for that

757
00:50:03,529 --> 00:50:08,099
then Microsoft for the her Bros client
will automatically get additional

758
00:50:08,099 --> 00:50:09,119
tickets

759
00:50:09,119 --> 00:50:15,980
depending on the trust level okay thanks

760
00:50:15,980 --> 00:50:19,810
anybody else will be shot

761
00:50:19,810 --> 00:50:24,380
alright

762
00:50:24,380 --> 00:50:26,950
well I guess that's a wrap so will be
around
