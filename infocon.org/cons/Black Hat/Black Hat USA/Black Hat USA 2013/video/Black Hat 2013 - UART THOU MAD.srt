1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:03,210
is good morning my name's the Toby
that's mickey

2
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:06,819
we're going to talk to you about York
could chill hands how many have you are

3
00:00:06,819 --> 00:00:09,830
here because there is no space in just
four stalls talk about Android

4
00:00:09,830 --> 00:00:12,910
when you're lying

5
00:00:12,910 --> 00:00:17,310
I'll how many you have any experience
with you are

6
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:20,720
orgy a tag be booking systems exe

7
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:25,619
okay so this is intended to be a general
overview and introduction to you are

8
00:00:25,619 --> 00:00:29,250
us those stuff that is repetitious for
you

9
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:32,090
our apologies and if there's something
new or this something I should like this

10
00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:32,860
talk about

11
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:36,860
let us know first

12
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:42,320
most important legal disclaimer this has
nothing to do with our employers

13
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:46,539
this is in no way they work their
opinions this is all our own stuff

14
00:00:46,539 --> 00:00:50,100
we take full responsibility for
everything and anything said here

15
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:53,600
anything goodies are brilliant and
everything bad is our fault

16
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,620
mickey wanna be that no

17
00:00:56,620 --> 00:01:00,550
law I'll

18
00:01:00,550 --> 00:01:03,579
a wehmeyer miners mickey a

19
00:01:03,579 --> 00:01:07,549
what I do for a living is rate hardware

20
00:01:07,549 --> 00:01:12,860
firmware I am but that

21
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:15,890
we but I his three

22
00:01:15,890 --> 00:01:20,640
last year we did talk about Windows
Sidebar Gadget and that that

23
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:25,380
used to be a web developer and turning
to the dark side and got involved in

24
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:26,298
real security

25
00:01:26,299 --> 00:01:30,750
much about it describing myself my name
is totally

26
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:34,350
I do enterprise security the I

27
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:38,970
break applications no hardware and
unfortunately after six as well

28
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:42,649
a.m. they've been doing it while I guess

29
00:01:42,649 --> 00:01:45,810
so

30
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:49,100
today we're going to run through a bunch
of different areas releasing background

31
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:50,399
on what you are it is

32
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:53,920
rather talk about what you can do with
it all that sort of stuff that

33
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:56,530
it's fun for we're going to talk a
little bit about embedded systems and

34
00:01:56,530 --> 00:01:57,820
why this is interesting

35
00:01:57,820 --> 00:02:01,390
we're going to see examples tools were
and talk about how you would get

36
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:04,250
involved in you are why it's fun easy to
play with

37
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:07,820
I'm never gonna give you some examples
away places where you succeeded in other

38
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:10,349
places where we haven't found anything
interesting in finally

39
00:02:10,348 --> 00:02:13,988
we're going to talk about if you're
developing embedded systems

40
00:02:13,989 --> 00:02:17,239
how you can do a better job than some of
these companies have

41
00:02:17,239 --> 00:02:21,200
love protecting their a systems from

42
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:27,349
explores so

43
00:02:27,349 --> 00:02:31,849
general injure I this is really just
about sharing our experience this is not

44
00:02:31,849 --> 00:02:34,369
going to be follows your days and

45
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:38,030
exciting new attacks your has been
around for a really long time

46
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:40,879
so there are people who have explored
this that this is something where when

47
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:41,920
we looked

48
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:46,970
it was normal to us and it was something
that we saw in not many people talking a

49
00:02:46,970 --> 00:02:50,370
lot of people talk about Jade had lotsa
people talk about other sorts is

50
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:51,420
reversing we're seeing

51
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:54,620
people talking about %uh stripping chips
these days

52
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:58,970
we hadn't seen this discussed so
overlooking here to do is to give you a

53
00:02:58,970 --> 00:02:59,739
little more about

54
00:02:59,739 --> 00:03:02,840
how to use it and how to explore with

55
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:08,370
how you go about doing so your
background

56
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:12,110
technically you art stands for universal
a synchronous received Jones

57
00:03:12,110 --> 00:03:16,739
receiver transmitter what is it were
we're not really sure if we think it

58
00:03:16,739 --> 00:03:18,769
came from heaven or maybe it's gnomes

59
00:03:18,769 --> 00:03:22,300
I they're pretty good sized actually
obviously do I

60
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:27,349
it's been around for a long time I a
very long time their references to it in

61
00:03:27,349 --> 00:03:28,370
the old I'll

62
00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:32,400
AT&T systems their references to seeing
it being developed

63
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:36,769
by Gordon Bell for PDP systems Johansson
is what a PDP is

64
00:03:36,769 --> 00:03:41,230
call okay I'll

65
00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:45,010
that's been around for a long time it's
a fairly fundamental concept

66
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:49,429
the kids build out the number different
ways the thing that matters about it

67
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:50,480
really rather than

68
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:53,659
where it came from or or who first
designed it is

69
00:03:53,659 --> 00:03:57,840
what it's used for and what goes through
it you get a desperate

70
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:02,040
what some data all sorts of interesting
data sometimes you can get raw data and

71
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:03,519
format it straight

72
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:06,989
no control anything going through it
it's very interesting

73
00:04:06,989 --> 00:04:10,409
the other pieces how embedded systems
actually use it

74
00:04:10,409 --> 00:04:13,420
and the reason that's interesting is
that it's frequently used as a consul

75
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:14,180
acquit

76
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:17,190
so on a device that has no KVM

77
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:21,478
has no expectation up having a display
of having any sort incurred mechanism

78
00:04:21,478 --> 00:04:25,130
use this as a way to actually get access
to the console

79
00:04:25,130 --> 00:04:29,650
on or at least a one other TD wise one
other channels that they can use to

80
00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:33,239
specifically do debugging or update or
modification of the system when it's

81
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:33,770
running

82
00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:37,000
what's it for

83
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,770
well officially it doesn't really basic
things that just translates from

84
00:04:41,770 --> 00:04:45,400
parallel to serial for months you can
see it you doing

85
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:48,560
okay good in practice where you really
end up with is a

86
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:52,009
interconnected that's feeding between
different parts the a

87
00:04:52,009 --> 00:04:56,259
system which means that you can use this
show as a consul

88
00:04:56,259 --> 00:04:58,820
and we'll talk about that you'll see
that and that's probably going to be

89
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:01,180
more interesting place but you can also
use it

90
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:04,669
when you connect to it to see me
information passing between

91
00:05:04,669 --> 00:05:08,830
different components on PCB you can
actually get different data streams

92
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:11,560
going back and forth which means that if
you need to debug something fairly

93
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:12,560
subtle

94
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:16,680
between your storage in your amor some
your CPU in your store do you can

95
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:19,930
actually start doing that here you can
see interesting things moving back and

96
00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:21,590
forth

97
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:26,380
the big 10 like I said in is that it's
going to be a given consul

98
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:31,169
and it's going to be used by most
embedded systems for that purpose

99
00:05:31,169 --> 00:05:34,758
when I used a tag well jJ is cool but

100
00:05:34,759 --> 00:05:38,479
it's more expensive in terms of the
hardware it also takes

101
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:42,820
a much have you left in terms of
building your skill set frankly

102
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:46,060
you can give you are too anyone who's
got a i

103
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:49,360
systems background estate got in your
face you're going to give me an ex

104
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,120
consul

105
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:54,070
and as long as they can play with that
they're going to be good in contrast

106
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:57,759
is using J tag you're gonna be doing a
kernel debugging gonna be dealing with

107
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:00,600
memory dumps you need to be on the
reassembly and understand what's going

108
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,370
on in terms of the system

109
00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:05,910
it's a heavier left they're both useful
that they do so for different sorts of

110
00:06:05,910 --> 00:06:08,360
things

111
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:11,979
so we talk about your soul how do we
recognize it

112
00:06:11,979 --> 00:06:16,530
physically allies this is what it looks
like

113
00:06:16,530 --> 00:06:19,530
or pins usually more most cases are or

114
00:06:19,530 --> 00:06:23,110
been sticking out BC the a sometimes
they're not

115
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:28,440
there's no header soldered just or and
brawls in a row

116
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:32,370
a sometimes its stack

117
00:06:32,370 --> 00:06:35,400
makes it easy simple all you need

118
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:38,639
or you are orbin one for voltage

119
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:42,419
1 per drop a reference and one for
receiving one Richard

120
00:06:42,419 --> 00:06:49,419
so who what system

121
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:55,719
so an interesting way to

122
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:59,919
verified and you are using your is did
you are finding you are

123
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:05,359
is to okay everything and had on the PCB

124
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:11,030
the for per what it's worth actually
most the time when we looked

125
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:15,460
you'll just see at row for vince or in
the majority the case is resolved

126
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:19,870
wrote for Vince it's really common but
there were some where r

127
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:23,210
look at it and I didn't see anything me
he would grab it and say I'll

128
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:28,639
yeah let's try that and so we want to
bring out exactly how you do that

129
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:32,699
so this is the the flow I'm the rock
below are you doing you find interesting

130
00:07:32,699 --> 00:07:36,620
in the bat in any configuration on the
PCB

131
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:40,060
I could be or buyers in a major s

132
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:43,740
for instance or arm

133
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:47,259
a role and Rovero all as

134
00:07:47,259 --> 00:07:51,259
nothing to do with anything you see on
the board or are you follow lines

135
00:07:51,259 --> 00:07:54,960
going from the CPU onto something

136
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:58,199
once you met those out need to find
round

137
00:07:58,199 --> 00:08:01,840
to the I'll talk about it later

138
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:06,800
this is a written in blood so just to
make sure that you don't prior to all

139
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:11,090
sometimes live there buy votes and your
203 votes and that they don't be

140
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:15,729
like each other you think that the
ground your device

141
00:08:15,729 --> 00:08:19,780
you would be embedded system the mean by
that to all would be embedded system

142
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:25,569
while it's booting if you are is used on
the amended system it will transmit

143
00:08:25,569 --> 00:08:28,919
so the easiest way would be just

144
00:08:28,919 --> 00:08:32,439
take receive lineup you to all and just
spoken all the pins and so you see

145
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:34,709
something

146
00:08:34,709 --> 00:08:37,940
its gibberish on the screen could be its

147
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:41,890
just brought it up or a your in the
different bothering

148
00:08:41,890 --> 00:08:45,920
the Prince the and you're just too tall

149
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:49,680
it's not garbage if you see English you
ever

150
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:52,680
we'll talk about the actual individual
tools reach these steps will mention

151
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:55,800
going to bust fire or talk about how to
check for voltage everything else in

152
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:59,339
just a little bit

153
00:08:59,339 --> 00:09:04,100
somatic systems at a fundamental level
the really very simple things and to

154
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:06,160
make an embedded system you just mean

155
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:09,660
three basic components in need some

156
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:12,769
a RAM you need a little bit a storage

157
00:09:12,769 --> 00:09:16,880
any deceive you you some simple examples
a different you components that you

158
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:17,779
might find

159
00:09:17,779 --> 00:09:21,670
but there are literally thousands of
vendors and

160
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:25,610
tens or hundreds of thousands love
components that you could combine in any

161
00:09:25,610 --> 00:09:26,360
safe

162
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:30,320
are in any combination to give you what
you need to be an embedded system

163
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:34,600
they're really very simple and as a
result there being played everywhere

164
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:37,930
this is the cliche with he say isn't
gonna

165
00:09:37,930 --> 00:09:41,750
have to pay for it later Internet of
Things

166
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:46,360
all but this is where you're getting the
effect that you put in logic and

167
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:52,510
everything

168
00:09:52,510 --> 00:09:56,269
generally where you're gonna see as a
result of this because they're

169
00:09:56,269 --> 00:10:00,390
being used everywhere is that there's
actually fairly consistent

170
00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:03,769
layouts the UC for different PCB's

171
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:07,660
and the it makes it much easier to start
recognizing things that's why

172
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:11,189
when we start looking at different
boards are looking for York

173
00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:15,279
the majority of them it was actually
pretty easy to find the actually or

174
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:20,070
up pinouts even when things went really
different

175
00:10:20,070 --> 00:10:25,070
it would be pretty predictable in the
recently in quotes around interesting is

176
00:10:25,070 --> 00:10:28,860
how do you know what interesting as well
as it turns out

177
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:32,380
you look at a couple these new start
noticing I'll

178
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:35,769
that looks like those are the right 4
pins those look like an interesting

179
00:10:35,769 --> 00:10:36,779
combination

180
00:10:36,779 --> 00:10:40,579
love I'll tag points I

181
00:10:40,579 --> 00:10:43,500
I should go get something there
interesting actually comes pretty clear

182
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:46,420
because this layouts are fairly standard

183
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:50,550
just to be clear this is not up I don't
consider this hardware hack a

184
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:54,540
this is a the low-tech way over

185
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:57,719
finding interesting stuff you don't need
to be a hardware hacker to do this

186
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:03,850
all you need is a couple basically all
very basic knowledge

187
00:11:03,850 --> 00:11:07,649
your mission like

188
00:11:07,649 --> 00:11:12,130
before we move on operating systems %uh
you may run into some art also

189
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:15,820
real time operating systems there are a
couple different bar

190
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:18,680
vendors out there but more and more what
you're likely to see is going to be

191
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:19,079
either

192
00:11:19,079 --> 00:11:22,399
BST or latex and really almost

193
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:25,459
I'll or what eighty

194
00:11:25,459 --> 00:11:29,279
personal time why any personal time it's
probably going to be Linux

195
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:31,820
it's not going to be in the next like
you're used to if you run it is a

196
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:33,670
desktop or for server

197
00:11:33,670 --> 00:11:36,990
it's gonna be stripped down to the point
where

198
00:11:36,990 --> 00:11:42,079
most your favorite was amazing and then
sometimes a really odd things are there

199
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:43,670
so we've seen cases where

200
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:47,219
X I'll start is in there even though
it's not necessary

201
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:50,420
or II GV

202
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:54,209
on the compilers a short sometimes

203
00:11:54,209 --> 00:11:57,950
but it's not consistently they all the
debug tools the CD DUP

204
00:11:57,950 --> 00:12:01,260
telnet met that it's still there

205
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:04,350
snow you at the same time useful stuff
like

206
00:12:04,350 --> 00:12:08,700
in the I may not be there you may
literally be doing chatting

207
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:12,180
%uh texter echoing a text into a file in
some cases

208
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:15,510
we have seen one with the iiNet yet was
are useful

209
00:12:15,510 --> 00:12:19,399
it was really anybody with it was an
anomaly was the time we can see one with

210
00:12:19,399 --> 00:12:20,820
the Senators

211
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:24,269
up I don't think we ever had to resort
to add

212
00:12:24,269 --> 00:12:28,060
by up a it was simplistic in many cases

213
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:31,779
most tools will be missing at least the
system level will have a very limited

214
00:12:31,779 --> 00:12:37,760
file system in general

215
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:41,750
so the everyone things are others when
we talked about this is when people ask

216
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:43,070
what we're talking about

217
00:12:43,070 --> 00:12:47,339
iran says okay so rather is right well
short routers are the obvious ones but

218
00:12:47,339 --> 00:12:50,339
there's so much more but the child

219
00:12:50,339 --> 00:12:53,899
stuff that we had sitting here are some
examples:

220
00:12:53,899 --> 00:12:57,529
be did this on our own budget we did
this on our own time so we can get some

221
00:12:57,529 --> 00:12:59,990
of the bigger and more interesting
devices but

222
00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:03,180
you're gonna see this in well for
instance you'll see this

223
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:06,850
in enterprise-class routers airport
priced past

224
00:13:06,850 --> 00:13:09,790
firewalls anything with embedded
hardware systems you're going to see you

225
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:10,639
are 10

226
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:13,769
anything doesn't expect to have had you
see your in

227
00:13:13,769 --> 00:13:18,010
I you're gonna see this in things like

228
00:13:18,010 --> 00:13:21,630
home power control systems I extend

229
00:13:21,630 --> 00:13:25,740
this is a amo are you'll see it in

230
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:30,060
HDTV stringers show your arm Hulu

231
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:34,269
I are your Roku box will have it all
these sorts of things are likely to have

232
00:13:34,269 --> 00:13:35,220
your

233
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:39,370
up we didn't you take apart are
refrigerators

234
00:13:39,370 --> 00:13:43,709
up both because well we got really old
church leaders but also because

235
00:13:43,709 --> 00:13:47,899
we didn't have to play social treaties
but you're likely to see if something's

236
00:13:47,899 --> 00:13:52,050
got invited logic you it's very likely
to have your tennis

237
00:13:52,050 --> 00:13:55,720
I found myself on a treadmill one day
looking and thinking

238
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:58,769
I bet this thing has your their bet it
does

239
00:13:58,769 --> 00:14:01,910
by and certainly it in the

240
00:14:01,910 --> 00:14:05,010
I actually what I'd be willing to bet
money that there's actually order

241
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:09,360
face you're gonna find this almost
everywhere including call

242
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:13,519
yet

243
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:17,380
with tools from

244
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:20,990
okay so the most easy

245
00:14:20,990 --> 00:14:25,610
wait to start find what would be using
the FCC database

246
00:14:25,610 --> 00:14:28,970
open on the Internet you can just look
up in SCCA being

247
00:14:28,970 --> 00:14:32,029
find interesting stuff so

248
00:14:32,029 --> 00:14:36,839
to make things interesting

249
00:14:36,839 --> 00:14:40,300
to connect to the network and will do
our

250
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:45,870
live example if you have any questions
please feel free to ask

251
00:14:45,870 --> 00:14:49,079
no

252
00:14:49,079 --> 00:14:52,779
over

253
00:14:52,779 --> 00:14:59,779
yeah

254
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:30,320
between model York's so the question was
sometimes in devices you'll see

255
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:33,680
multiple York interfaces available and
there's going to be some

256
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:37,530
logic that's used in some code is used
to control which one

257
00:15:37,530 --> 00:15:41,819
%uh is going to be that send or receive
data from

258
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:45,430
at different points in the platform I

259
00:15:45,430 --> 00:15:48,730
as far as I know the

260
00:15:48,730 --> 00:15:51,750
when we've seen that it's been in the

261
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:54,760
kernel for the system as it starts
booting

262
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:58,000
I'll he been stranger

263
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:04,050
represent ice cream but my computer
doesn't like I'll

264
00:16:04,050 --> 00:16:08,290
BIII I generally be looking at the
system configuration for

265
00:16:08,290 --> 00:16:12,250
a which a a device it's actually

266
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:15,940
configured to a read out to in reading
from

267
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:21,000
at but I haven't seen many others would
be interested afterwards to look who

268
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:25,950
you need to know which ones you see in
there

269
00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:32,740
it's intentional

270
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:36,880
course unfortunately didn't make
sufficient sacrifices morning to the

271
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:39,080
demigod so we are playing with fire a
little bit

272
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:42,630
but I'll no

273
00:16:42,630 --> 00:16:45,880
those the Mac decided to go on strike

274
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:49,939
okay I don't like the slides so up

275
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:53,890
you have to trust us I or you could be
on your own device right now

276
00:16:53,890 --> 00:16:57,990
pull up to the FCC ID database and we
can give you an example

277
00:16:57,990 --> 00:17:02,310
love what an FCC ID looks like you can
find them on the bottom other device

278
00:17:02,310 --> 00:17:09,310
on so you see something

279
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:16,100
under the list goes on

280
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:20,290
certification stamps you'll see
literally something that says FCC ID

281
00:17:20,290 --> 00:17:24,579
miss when it's P Y 30 9400 124

282
00:17:24,579 --> 00:17:28,899
as an example its always going to be
there are anything that's a legitimate

283
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:31,060
device is going to have an FCC ID

284
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:34,500
you just go to the database and search
for it

285
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:38,570
and your goal and you'll get back an
entire Saturday you'll get

286
00:17:38,570 --> 00:17:43,070
on datasheets for you'll get images all
the PCs

287
00:17:43,070 --> 00:17:46,678
for a couple different views are as well
as having the

288
00:17:46,679 --> 00:17:49,960
covers stripped of other components and

289
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:53,470
general information it becomes really
useful it's the really easy way to go

290
00:17:53,470 --> 00:17:54,800
and look for

291
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:58,950
I things that are likely to have your
dinner faces and to try and figure out

292
00:17:58,950 --> 00:17:59,700
where they are

293
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:05,080
the next one on this is a bust are

294
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:09,870
a anyone here does not know what a bus
part is you had

295
00:18:09,870 --> 00:18:13,290
somebody okay so this is a buscarte

296
00:18:13,290 --> 00:18:16,690
stunning alright then

297
00:18:16,690 --> 00:18:21,429
are sitting down used to it this study
the right thing

298
00:18:21,429 --> 00:18:25,900
is mmm what's commonly called the Swiss
Army knife over hardware hacker

299
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:29,440
arm we we're using this because

300
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:33,679
it's more convenient to use it doesn't
mean that we can use anything else

301
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:38,550
other out we gonna talk about the print
or just like eight bucks on ebay this

302
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:39,980
one is 30 bucks

303
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:43,240
not not a very expensive

304
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:47,220
20 you all up things all love

305
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:50,750
a backers control sabes

306
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:54,580
it allows you to interface with a huge
number hardware interfaces that allows

307
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:56,740
you to control water rate and

308
00:18:56,740 --> 00:19:00,410
reset the device into a number of other
cable things its

309
00:19:00,410 --> 00:19:05,179
you can spend many many hours just
talking about the Aspire

310
00:19:05,179 --> 00:19:09,420
and its actually I a something that's
been built out of the

311
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:13,880
of the packing in this or the builder
community

312
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:17,570
other major community it so that the and
they seem to support the companies that

313
00:19:17,570 --> 00:19:18,428
actually make them

314
00:19:18,429 --> 00:19:22,179
they're just really any things to do
really handy things to have

315
00:19:22,179 --> 00:19:27,220
next on the list on the list as a
multi-meter

316
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:30,760
so we're talking about how you make sure
that your

317
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:35,150
voltages in too high for whatever your
tools or this is how you want to do it

318
00:19:35,150 --> 00:19:38,770
there and that's an awesome ground by
Mintel

319
00:19:38,770 --> 00:19:43,418
she can also do without battery in
Andheri the

320
00:19:43,419 --> 00:19:48,169
other tools like this eight bucks on
eBay USB UART

321
00:19:48,169 --> 00:19:51,200
able the may if you can

322
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:56,460
buy from China in the under a dollar the
by the mall a soldering iron

323
00:19:56,460 --> 00:20:00,580
very important here find I'm hands on
the PCB in 10

324
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:05,250
connector bus art to it you need to make
the

325
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:09,090
comfortable a magnifying glass

326
00:20:09,090 --> 00:20:13,510
is where old I'm and see very well and
sometimes it as a really really small

327
00:20:13,510 --> 00:20:16,970
some these embedded systems are tienen
arm

328
00:20:16,970 --> 00:20:20,030
the we move for instance is the you

329
00:20:20,030 --> 00:20:23,560
have a credit card or the entire PCB

330
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:27,440
arm the there is there a TV

331
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:30,690
a beaming devices that are mobile mobile

332
00:20:30,690 --> 00:20:35,010
rather the imply that 3G much but to
them and they connect to act as an

333
00:20:35,010 --> 00:20:36,690
access point

334
00:20:36,690 --> 00:20:41,870
those are really find me PCB that that's
what they're really small

335
00:20:41,870 --> 00:20:45,600
can do it with a magnifying glass and a
bright light

336
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:51,480
so the the reason you would want both
the USB UART cable as well as something

337
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:52,650
like the bus pirate

338
00:20:52,650 --> 00:20:56,070
and you really you probably want both as
well as the other in pieces the

339
00:20:56,070 --> 00:20:57,510
soldering irons other ish

340
00:20:57,510 --> 00:21:01,650
if you have the pins actually set for
you if you actually have pins on the

341
00:21:01,650 --> 00:21:06,400
test points I then you can easily just
plug into one of the

342
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:12,200
I test points and plug it into your USB
port with the USB to UART interface and

343
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,419
it's very easy

344
00:21:13,419 --> 00:21:17,810
if its editing the yield just get a
whatever's coming out of the ordinary

345
00:21:17,810 --> 00:21:18,240
face

346
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:22,110
I that's really handy to have at the
same time

347
00:21:22,110 --> 00:21:25,720
a lot of the times you're searching for
what the pins actually mean and what

348
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:27,870
they're for and having something like
the

349
00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:31,090
aspiring which allows you to be very
polite very

350
00:21:31,090 --> 00:21:34,550
the configuration very assortment of AC
working with

351
00:21:34,550 --> 00:21:39,409
becomes much more useful so that you can
experiment and look around a little bit

352
00:21:39,410 --> 00:21:43,200
finally we have something to show you

353
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:46,780
back to the FCC ID so I'm going to go
Google

354
00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:50,899
FCCA the first was all

355
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:56,419
no web page redirects is the new one it
needs the FCC ID so let's take the

356
00:21:56,419 --> 00:22:03,419
if the that this area this one

357
00:22:03,890 --> 00:22:06,910
the third the first three characters

358
00:22:06,910 --> 00:22:13,910
and then the rest is that

359
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:24,070
with the one are

360
00:22:24,070 --> 00:22:29,929
ensuring then she an update and inside
this thing

361
00:22:29,930 --> 00:22:36,080
use the wings is internal photos binge
of photos

362
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:39,530
other device its easier to

363
00:22:39,530 --> 00:22:44,100
find compatible devices without buying
them just fine arts CA the

364
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:47,180
and looking in journals and you don't
have to spend money

365
00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:50,900
this is a a great example

366
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:54,740
as you can see undermined

367
00:22:54,740 --> 00:23:01,740
get this large

368
00:23:10,570 --> 00:23:14,080
as you can see here have or

369
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:18,699
and sticking out no sometimes the FCC ID
pictures will not

370
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:22,159
represent reality because the these
companies that make these photos to the

371
00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:23,409
FCC for approval

372
00:23:23,409 --> 00:23:27,190
but it won't be the final piece is the
most the time so

373
00:23:27,190 --> 00:23:30,860
the production products my not have
those and sticking out over

374
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:34,460
but are as you can see for peres

375
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:38,610
can only mean one thing well

376
00:23:38,610 --> 00:23:42,029
its most likely only going to mean one
thing: thank you for that

377
00:23:42,029 --> 00:23:45,549
and so we have a CPU

378
00:23:45,549 --> 00:23:50,070
we have a last year and

379
00:23:50,070 --> 00:23:53,370
your side to this is the the Rio's

380
00:23:53,370 --> 00:23:58,120
sometimes the resume and

381
00:23:58,120 --> 00:24:02,230
in you can Google the chip and get more
data off it

382
00:24:02,230 --> 00:24:05,440
there

383
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:08,850
and

384
00:24:08,850 --> 00:24:11,950
so a simple example of how you would use
the

385
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:16,340
FCC ID interface on the

386
00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:19,549
it seems like a really simple and
obvious thing player

387
00:24:19,549 --> 00:24:24,259
really is just tremendously helpful it
in ends up being the default thing

388
00:24:24,259 --> 00:24:27,389
go to on every single case yet

389
00:24:27,389 --> 00:24:30,929
you know it's for the

390
00:24:30,929 --> 00:24:34,480
its military at it was our driver

391
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:38,889
and it is it is a valuable service
provided by the government

392
00:24:38,889 --> 00:24:43,309
who was a I'll so

393
00:24:43,309 --> 00:24:49,049
yet okay bottled up so

394
00:24:49,049 --> 00:24:52,389
a eureka moment is when you plug in the

395
00:24:52,389 --> 00:24:56,429
your and then you get the the next show
up which is awesome

396
00:24:56,429 --> 00:25:00,990
we all love the next shows and most
though these just the show

397
00:25:00,990 --> 00:25:04,210
and as ru and no authentication

398
00:25:04,210 --> 00:25:08,039
no authentication whatsoever it's only
get a shell

399
00:25:08,039 --> 00:25:11,110
it's really funny it would show that
didn't require you to login

400
00:25:11,110 --> 00:25:15,389
and once you're here in the show in just
browse it

401
00:25:15,389 --> 00:25:20,009
and you you see interesting stuff for
instance you can go into the

402
00:25:20,009 --> 00:25:23,279
web directory up your device and see

403
00:25:23,279 --> 00:25:26,539
all the while going to the numerator
going to force them just

404
00:25:26,539 --> 00:25:29,559
a bless the a

405
00:25:29,559 --> 00:25:32,570
see the permissions everyone

406
00:25:32,570 --> 00:25:35,619
some so these are named very funny like
info

407
00:25:35,619 --> 00:25:40,899
sorry this is dealing with an embedded
device so this is something where

408
00:25:40,899 --> 00:25:45,909
if you didn't have this interface you
have no other method

409
00:25:45,909 --> 00:25:49,309
%uh getting to this information it would
be a pure black box experiment

410
00:25:49,309 --> 00:25:52,940
you'd be talking Raub bird forcing you
be fussing EB

411
00:25:52,940 --> 00:25:56,649
asking whether people had seen all the
sudden with this

412
00:25:56,649 --> 00:26:00,070
you have the doors wide open

413
00:26:00,070 --> 00:26:07,070
everything's just exposed their

414
00:26:08,419 --> 00:26:14,879
beans

415
00:26:14,879 --> 00:26:21,879
so why would it matter

416
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:34,490
so the question is would right so

417
00:26:34,490 --> 00:26:37,960
so the question was why would this
matter if you need physical access to do

418
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:38,350
it

419
00:26:38,350 --> 00:26:42,139
and I swear we didn't his he's not a
friend of ours we don't know when we can

420
00:26:42,139 --> 00:26:43,850
set him up to ask that question

421
00:26:43,850 --> 00:26:47,679
up so when we give you the answer in
like three minutes

422
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:52,429
up it wasn't that he got paid to do that
thank you there

423
00:26:52,429 --> 00:26:55,490
up the answer

424
00:26:55,490 --> 00:26:59,279
will win the next slide others I show
you it will show you the answer that

425
00:26:59,279 --> 00:26:59,869
question

426
00:26:59,869 --> 00:27:03,070
awesome questions a so

427
00:27:03,070 --> 00:27:06,428
what else can you do you looking a

428
00:27:06,429 --> 00:27:09,850
from the device from the inside out

429
00:27:09,850 --> 00:27:14,960
you you have an insider look what's
going on inside so if you if you

430
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:18,470
tester attack so you wanna check
something against the vice

431
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:22,360
it's not just the black box anymore you
get the CD processes

432
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:26,369
sale if you do something wrong get to
see %uh crashes from the kernel you get

433
00:27:26,369 --> 00:27:27,029
that

434
00:27:27,029 --> 00:27:30,279
yet more information you get to interact
with it like it's a real computer

435
00:27:30,279 --> 00:27:34,220
like it's a real system in this is some
%uh the

436
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:38,119
d the wonder in the value tranny gets
lost because everyone's used to looking

437
00:27:38,119 --> 00:27:38,750
at

438
00:27:38,750 --> 00:27:42,850
debug information in seeing this stuff
from every computer that you interact

439
00:27:42,850 --> 00:27:43,240
with

440
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:47,169
instead of thinking about the only get
this from a laptop or Unix System or

441
00:27:47,169 --> 00:27:50,500
whatever I'll see you use to that has
SSH or has some other interface that is

442
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:51,359
friendly to you

443
00:27:51,359 --> 00:27:55,580
and is intended to deliver this
information to you imagine the plugin

444
00:27:55,580 --> 00:27:59,629
because its next to me this still all

445
00:27:59,629 --> 00:28:03,049
and you want to know something about
what's on it and you decide that you're

446
00:28:03,049 --> 00:28:04,950
gonna try and figure out how it works

447
00:28:04,950 --> 00:28:08,730
all you're doing is throwing stuff up
against a blank

448
00:28:08,730 --> 00:28:12,850
unresponsive wall in till you have
something like this as an interface into

449
00:28:12,850 --> 00:28:13,840
all the sudden

450
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:17,169
for the value be able to explore or

451
00:28:17,169 --> 00:28:20,519
research or chilling learn about

452
00:28:20,519 --> 00:28:24,359
this becomes this takes you back to the
point where you have mail system to

453
00:28:24,359 --> 00:28:25,309
interact with

454
00:28:25,309 --> 00:28:29,399
see other stuff that you seen here none
of this should be surprising or unusual

455
00:28:29,399 --> 00:28:32,649
to anyone whose blog into a system we're
done debugging any sort

456
00:28:32,649 --> 00:28:36,570
what you need to recognize is that it's
cool because otherwise

457
00:28:36,570 --> 00:28:39,710
you be guessing at a blank wall you just

458
00:28:39,710 --> 00:28:43,990
not have any sort of information coming
back and it makes it much easier to find

459
00:28:43,990 --> 00:28:44,889
things

460
00:28:44,889 --> 00:28:48,330
that make actually it may actually be
useful

461
00:28:48,330 --> 00:28:52,990
and interest and to answer your question

462
00:28:52,990 --> 00:28:59,990
there

463
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:07,200
all

464
00:29:07,910 --> 00:29:09,970
that's one aspect certainly one way you
can do it

465
00:29:09,970 --> 00:29:13,730
absolute that that's that's mean it said
his answer was yeah

466
00:29:13,730 --> 00:29:17,120
you use this as a way to do for your
body research against devices

467
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:21,820
and then what you've now got is the
specific knowledge about an entire class

468
00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:23,049
in the device

469
00:29:23,049 --> 00:29:26,049
so um for instance as anyone who

470
00:29:26,049 --> 00:29:31,379
read the a scanning internet 2012 report
that was published on

471
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:35,470
a pastebin in which is yes so the

472
00:29:35,470 --> 00:29:38,660
compromised many many many many

473
00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:43,549
embedded devices and replace the
firmware with custom firmware

474
00:29:43,549 --> 00:29:46,600
and they had to find one abilities in
all these devices that they could use to

475
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:47,419
do this

476
00:29:47,419 --> 00:29:50,980
well the way you do something like that
would be the you something like the UART

477
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:51,419
interface

478
00:29:51,419 --> 00:29:54,490
standing very like the UGA tagay on

479
00:29:54,490 --> 00:29:57,559
by thats guess

480
00:29:57,559 --> 00:30:00,720
but that's exactly what you would use
this for the kids you got additional

481
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:01,500
information

482
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:04,740
it also in some cases gives you other
information

483
00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:08,120
like for instance the certificates

484
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:11,410
a sometimes not just the public
certificate

485
00:30:11,410 --> 00:30:15,250
sometimes also the private key is well
for signing you'll see the

486
00:30:15,250 --> 00:30:19,460
passwords stored in there that are going
to be you know a universal across all

487
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:20,700
the systems in the entire

488
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:26,669
a space I you can you a number different
things you can

489
00:30:26,669 --> 00:30:30,780
easily use this for giving yourself
debug access for you or

490
00:30:30,780 --> 00:30:34,480
earth for fussing investing is difficult
if you don't have any

491
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:39,530
suzie is difficult but it's more
difficult if you don't have access to

492
00:30:39,530 --> 00:30:41,220
debug information at all

493
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:44,580
all the sudden the device stopped
responding and you have no clue why you

494
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:45,850
don't know whether it was dis-

495
00:30:45,850 --> 00:30:51,130
a fuzz tester the previous one to
fifteen back it's much easier to do this

496
00:30:51,130 --> 00:30:51,790
sort of stuff

497
00:30:51,790 --> 00:30:56,850
when you actually have the information
yet I'll

498
00:30:56,850 --> 00:31:00,250
by the way the docking we know was that

499
00:31:00,250 --> 00:31:04,750
as responsibly dispose everything they
were actually going to talk about to be

500
00:31:04,750 --> 00:31:05,530
clear we did

501
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:09,660
responsible disclosure on vendors were
engaged in sex has been released

502
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:13,660
firmware updates have been released its
up to date in the vendors would work

503
00:31:13,660 --> 00:31:14,120
with

504
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:18,940
that would like to thank them and

505
00:31:18,940 --> 00:31:22,800
soul

506
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:26,419
why else would this be interesting I'll

507
00:31:26,419 --> 00:31:30,230
you asked about you can you connect easy
for users to find all your abilities

508
00:31:30,230 --> 00:31:33,290
you could connecting remotely with the
interesting thing is in this is

509
00:31:33,290 --> 00:31:34,428
something that

510
00:31:34,429 --> 00:31:39,610
up someone I K think tremendously highly
oven and just

511
00:31:39,610 --> 00:31:43,120
is really an inspiration %uh pleaded
I'll a

512
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:47,290
couple years ago and some work that he
did Barnaby Jack did an ATM hack

513
00:31:47,290 --> 00:31:50,490
a couple years ago everyone knew
everyone saw it one other things the

514
00:31:50,490 --> 00:31:52,190
clean it out though is that

515
00:31:52,190 --> 00:31:57,330
the cheat the vault in the ATM really
hard to get and it's really hard to

516
00:31:57,330 --> 00:31:57,960
crack

517
00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:02,820
however there's about four keys that
allow you access all the logic systems

518
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:06,550
and having the sport you can unlock that
pop it open

519
00:32:06,550 --> 00:32:10,020
plugin the USB stick a close it turned
back on

520
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:13,750
reboots with your firmware game over so

521
00:32:13,750 --> 00:32:17,910
even if you walking up to a system
having access to this interface

522
00:32:17,910 --> 00:32:21,059
its external exposure you understand
some other pieces because in some cases

523
00:32:21,059 --> 00:32:21,830
they are

524
00:32:21,830 --> 00:32:25,710
are accessible even without cracking the
full case you can do some interesting

525
00:32:25,710 --> 00:32:26,450
things

526
00:32:26,450 --> 00:32:29,450
so

527
00:32:29,450 --> 00:32:33,460
forensics on embedded systems what once
you do chain went to make changes

528
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:37,340
who you are a after the system reboots

529
00:32:37,340 --> 00:32:42,090
at all disappears it's all about I'll
the way at them in a bad system works

530
00:32:42,090 --> 00:32:46,360
is needs its all operating system from a
flash loaded into RAM

531
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:50,390
and boot it is I'll every time boots in
both from the same image

532
00:32:50,390 --> 00:32:53,700
so every change you make after it boots
as well

533
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:59,000
so what can we do with it

534
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:02,530
a we we thing ever on way to show you
guys

535
00:33:02,530 --> 00:33:05,879
up prank your friends

536
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:11,400
basically we did what we did was we take
we took a

537
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:14,700
the very or cheap robber

538
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:18,330
that the battery back in the back which
make the mobile

539
00:33:18,330 --> 00:33:22,179
innocuous your video on a second and
reprogram

540
00:33:22,179 --> 00:33:25,940
reprogram that with a with this

541
00:33:25,940 --> 00:33:29,010
is that

542
00:33:29,010 --> 00:33:32,620
alcee no value

543
00:33:32,620 --> 00:33:39,620
a second

544
00:33:52,820 --> 00:33:57,270
wall sound does not sound we have

545
00:33:57,270 --> 00:34:01,190
the tiger

546
00:34:01,190 --> 00:34:05,350
between our our

547
00:34:05,350 --> 00:34:12,350
the battery back in the back

548
00:34:14,630 --> 00:34:18,420
default settings with the American
Society I think that be at the pawn box

549
00:34:18,420 --> 00:34:22,010
toward we know that

550
00:34:22,010 --> 00:34:27,140
specifically designed to scare people

551
00:34:27,139 --> 00:34:30,350
it's not the same as carrots and
designed to encourage you to put push

552
00:34:30,350 --> 00:34:32,089
the happy red shiny button

553
00:34:32,090 --> 00:34:38,880
there we do with this connects to the
router after the roots

554
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:42,530
the other day the voices to transfer
files to the device

555
00:34:42,530 --> 00:34:47,580
this is the your interface again this is
the

556
00:34:47,580 --> 00:34:54,580
more or other device

557
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,329
as you can see the lights are blinking
on the router

558
00:35:17,329 --> 00:35:20,670
doing something and you never you
network showing up

559
00:35:20,670 --> 00:35:24,040
it's really blurry tho you can see the
second

560
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:31,040
yep yeah

561
00:35:31,050 --> 00:35:34,730
most things a connect no automatically
Datz wifi and

562
00:35:34,730 --> 00:35:38,390
I most people connect automatically tatt
wifi

563
00:35:38,390 --> 00:35:42,848
the border I paste the link to a Google

564
00:35:42,849 --> 00:35:46,150
and a new network and I and I had go

565
00:35:46,150 --> 00:35:53,150
can y'all read that

566
00:35:53,650 --> 00:35:57,460
its yeah

567
00:35:57,460 --> 00:36:00,550
so by plugging this into the router

568
00:36:00,550 --> 00:36:05,220
the router was wiped a reflashed well
but I believe are not reflect

569
00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:05,859
reconfigured

570
00:36:05,859 --> 00:36:08,990
was in the Flash which is actually in
benefit here I'll

571
00:36:08,990 --> 00:36:12,550
and now become something that will
automatically compromise anything that

572
00:36:12,550 --> 00:36:13,410
connects to it

573
00:36:13,410 --> 00:36:20,410
the beauty is when it rebooted is make
pointed out way

574
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:29,810
slow boil

575
00:36:29,810 --> 00:36:32,870
that no forensics want to get the power

576
00:36:32,870 --> 00:36:39,870
all resets the normal all

577
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:53,400
yep pretty much you can do this you can
do that you can do this and it would

578
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:53,950
take some work

579
00:36:53,950 --> 00:37:00,950
you can do something for the questioner
bigger

580
00:37:02,210 --> 00:37:07,530
the say that again

581
00:37:07,530 --> 00:37:11,440
what we need be these in a jackal

582
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:15,230
know you mean the unit %uh the Jordan
reno's on the

583
00:37:15,230 --> 00:37:19,120
in this box one is and internet are you
know she'll

584
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:22,779
which we use the servile so taxes

585
00:37:22,780 --> 00:37:26,580
as a web client and three what we
telling the embedded systems a

586
00:37:26,580 --> 00:37:29,810
W get worse are the files from that line

587
00:37:29,810 --> 00:37:33,330
and we just get whatever we wanna as at
first he wanted to put

588
00:37:33,330 --> 00:37:36,560
rick rolled by the was to make Bieber
the medicine

589
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:41,029
and I refuse to do that to people I
think it's obscene crore

590
00:37:41,030 --> 00:37:44,170
all so the beauty is the you just

591
00:37:44,170 --> 00:37:48,380
pull the power and the configurations on
it flashes back to where it started

592
00:37:48,380 --> 00:37:52,040
there's no evidence there's no
information and at some point someone's

593
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:54,029
going to have to pull a powerful waste

594
00:37:54,030 --> 00:37:57,910
yet and I think this level solar panel
on this thing

595
00:37:57,910 --> 00:38:01,440
and one for a long time unless you live
in the pacific northwest

596
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:05,700
be so

597
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:08,750
arm the message to the end so we can
make a

598
00:38:08,750 --> 00:38:11,810
once again your show you how

599
00:38:11,810 --> 00:38:15,480
back to a router and for a

600
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:18,520
when the system so

601
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:23,220
we can do this its buries its a fifteen
dollar router

602
00:38:23,220 --> 00:38:26,570
super it's not like a hundred-dollar
hundred-dollar

603
00:38:26,570 --> 00:38:30,400
I'll a

604
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:35,850
I'll and distinct all it's certainly not
as powerful as a

605
00:38:35,850 --> 00:38:40,200
on blogger something or or pineapple but
for some cases you don't need to be

606
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:44,950
and at fifteen dollars I'm much more
willing to throw a fifteen dollar device

607
00:38:44,950 --> 00:38:48,570
then I am to throw away under $200 or
$500 dollar device

608
00:38:48,570 --> 00:38:52,300
a much more willing to throw a fifteen
college a place

609
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:57,340
sheesh so we work with the

610
00:38:57,340 --> 00:39:00,480
a we mow at taking the Belkin

611
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:03,200
and they specifically upgrading the
firmware to actually just require a

612
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:03,810
login

613
00:39:03,810 --> 00:39:07,049
and if I'm in a little this is this is
that the first step

614
00:39:07,050 --> 00:39:11,190
in terms of actually doing this the we
don't recommend getting rid of the

615
00:39:11,190 --> 00:39:15,630
your interface that doesn't make sense
anyone who's worked with hardware or

616
00:39:15,630 --> 00:39:18,860
build hardware understand you need some
way to do this work

617
00:39:18,860 --> 00:39:22,990
but there are some simple things you can
do that just make it more secure

618
00:39:22,990 --> 00:39:26,300
who first one being just simply

619
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:30,330
require login have a user and password
in even if its generic even if that

620
00:39:30,330 --> 00:39:32,259
changes just with your

621
00:39:32,260 --> 00:39:36,230
different version is the firmware you
raised the bar just that little bit

622
00:39:36,230 --> 00:39:43,230
or a backup all

623
00:39:43,940 --> 00:39:49,260
I'll the other dates are two things you
can do you can disable logging this is

624
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:49,850
probably

625
00:39:49,850 --> 00:39:53,410
this is actually a really important one
%uh because even if you can't log in

626
00:39:53,410 --> 00:39:55,640
even if you just got a blank screen if
you're dealing with

627
00:39:55,640 --> 00:40:00,230
a consul output for anyone who knows the
existing you're gonna get on the console

628
00:40:00,230 --> 00:40:03,330
you're going to get just a dumb but this
is lots continues to hear the alert for

629
00:40:03,330 --> 00:40:04,850
this is too many things going

630
00:40:04,850 --> 00:40:08,509
I as and party admin login is gonna
still out there

631
00:40:08,510 --> 00:40:11,580
you can disable it easily enough it's a
simple thing it's worth doing and

632
00:40:11,580 --> 00:40:12,930
prevent it

633
00:40:12,930 --> 00:40:15,990
real-life example would be: an embedded
system

634
00:40:15,990 --> 00:40:19,020
have had a USB port on

635
00:40:19,020 --> 00:40:23,680
you are to the with credentials cannot
be and you just see that

636
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:27,770
the logging assistant counsel once you
plug into USB

637
00:40:27,770 --> 00:40:31,980
a storage device that looks for a
specific file a specific bad and outputs

638
00:40:31,980 --> 00:40:33,820
it to the logging industry

639
00:40:33,820 --> 00:40:38,190
so that will allow you to basically all
back different the two older versions of

640
00:40:38,190 --> 00:40:39,440
the firmware because thats

641
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:42,930
the the way with supposed to be a a
backup

642
00:40:42,930 --> 00:40:46,560
other waited the the only other way to
update the firmware on otherwise would

643
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:47,570
be to go online

644
00:40:47,570 --> 00:40:51,140
so I you can remove the ordinary face

645
00:40:51,140 --> 00:40:54,900
if it's possible if you don't need it
got a cousin to the device it's really

646
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:55,900
the

647
00:40:55,900 --> 00:40:58,990
the most effective choice but like I
said as as people

648
00:40:58,990 --> 00:41:02,880
you deal with hardware it's going to be
hard to justify and doing that

649
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:07,640
this is what we've recommended in
general and yet

650
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:11,460
this is so easy to you the is this on
the streets or in pretty obvious to you

651
00:41:11,460 --> 00:41:11,890
are

652
00:41:11,890 --> 00:41:15,589
we met our goals we wanted this to sound
like something you could pick up in an

653
00:41:15,590 --> 00:41:17,310
afternoon and it really is

654
00:41:17,310 --> 00:41:22,070
it's just that simple so the question
why are people doing this go play

655
00:41:22,070 --> 00:41:26,190
going complete doing all

656
00:41:26,190 --> 00:41:30,810
so yet we wanted to make this all the
fun so we get this thing

657
00:41:30,810 --> 00:41:34,000
arm the device ago rip lost

658
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:39,050
open were here we will try and
accommodate requests from the audience

659
00:41:39,050 --> 00:41:42,920
you know and was the buzzing or other
sorts of stuff

660
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:46,630
by the way I before we get distracted by
doing that

661
00:41:46,630 --> 00:41:49,920
realized he didn't mention it at the
beginning the first

662
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:53,580
embedded talk I ever saw in the first
thing I ever saw that made me think this

663
00:41:53,580 --> 00:41:56,730
artist of the school was Barnaby Jack in
2006

664
00:41:56,730 --> 00:42:02,290
a talking about debugging and rewriting
firmware on a home robbery

665
00:42:02,290 --> 00:42:05,550
did he manage to make the home router
download binaries you are interested in

666
00:42:05,550 --> 00:42:06,590
the head of time

667
00:42:06,590 --> 00:42:10,170
inject his back door into them and then
recalculate the hasher the hash

668
00:42:10,170 --> 00:42:11,820
displayed on the website

669
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:15,490
was correct for the modified Mel by area

670
00:42:15,490 --> 00:42:19,290
he did it with the J tagged a

671
00:42:19,290 --> 00:42:23,060
it was amazing and awesome he totally
inspired me and

672
00:42:23,060 --> 00:42:26,259
I think inspired lotsa lotsa people so
we just wanted to say that we wouldn't

673
00:42:26,260 --> 00:42:29,680
be on this platform for him

674
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:33,350
so I open the device

675
00:42:33,350 --> 00:42:37,049
the power I have a bust are

676
00:42:37,050 --> 00:42:44,050
connected to my computer just switch to
the second

677
00:42:47,890 --> 00:42:52,740
them or anything turn on the camera and
show you what the actual

678
00:42:52,740 --> 00:42:59,740
PC looks like

679
00:43:08,700 --> 00:43:15,700
them year

680
00:43:22,730 --> 00:43:29,250
them

681
00:43:29,250 --> 00:43:35,110
K

682
00:43:35,110 --> 00:43:38,350
so this is the rather on the table here

683
00:43:38,350 --> 00:43:41,350
a simple

684
00:43:41,350 --> 00:43:48,350
pins

685
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:52,970
any questions all I think

686
00:43:52,970 --> 00:43:56,670
were happy we're going to keep poking at
the stuff we've got some more time but

687
00:43:56,670 --> 00:43:59,850
don't feel obliged if you don't know I'm
interested to see this part you don't

688
00:43:59,850 --> 00:44:01,210
have to stay the slides

689
00:44:01,210 --> 00:44:05,030
will make available I'm not was a
majority this is just an example how you

690
00:44:05,030 --> 00:44:06,650
can do this and how easy it is

691
00:44:06,650 --> 00:44:10,800
so if you've got questions you'd like to
ask feel free to come up with you

692
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:15,080
are interested to see this please stay
or happy song it's not

693
00:44:15,080 --> 00:44:19,560
we won't hold you to it and we won't
leave you leaving

694
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:22,580
so all we need is a

695
00:44:22,580 --> 00:44:28,040
ground Tx and Rx mmm so first we find
round

696
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:34,090
we said you if you use the more thing
you know you know this

697
00:44:34,090 --> 00:44:37,260
this function

698
00:44:37,260 --> 00:44:40,790
that you could you guys you that year

699
00:44:40,790 --> 00:44:45,779
so to find the the ground usually when
you do is you look for something

700
00:44:45,780 --> 00:44:49,420
like this a whole

701
00:44:49,420 --> 00:44:53,020
in the PCB or a exposed surface

702
00:44:53,020 --> 00:44:56,750
the frame

703
00:44:56,750 --> 00:45:01,700
of the wireless controller like this for
instance

704
00:45:01,700 --> 00:45:06,220
this golden strip will be using
connected to ground sometimes the ground

705
00:45:06,220 --> 00:45:07,270
plane is obvious

706
00:45:07,270 --> 00:45:10,410
the antenna and as

707
00:45:10,410 --> 00:45:16,690
are also good grounds soldiers gonna or

708
00:45:16,690 --> 00:45:20,610
these things one at the time a that's
the grounding

709
00:45:20,610 --> 00:45:25,740
that's not gone the other way so

710
00:45:25,740 --> 00:45:31,230
this one would be ground I'm it wasn't
going to Best Buy with ground

711
00:45:31,230 --> 00:45:35,200
to that one that's it we're done not now
outside the fun stuff

712
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:42,200
gimmick to the last forever

713
00:45:46,190 --> 00:45:53,190
said that too

714
00:45:53,380 --> 00:45:58,690
a serial sorry go back the

715
00:45:58,690 --> 00:46:02,210
different modes in the bus bar I'm gonna
choose you aren't number three the

716
00:46:02,210 --> 00:46:05,640
and I'm going to speed up the bus

717
00:46:05,640 --> 00:46:09,049
up most devices will be 150 in 200

718
00:46:09,050 --> 00:46:12,500
some going to use that the

719
00:46:12,500 --> 00:46:16,490
I have never encountered a situation
when I had

720
00:46:16,490 --> 00:46:20,830
wear a hat that choose the parity bits
or any other information so that just

721
00:46:20,830 --> 00:46:22,279
leave it as the fall

722
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:26,620
and be up with I'm going to use is
normal because I have brown

723
00:46:26,620 --> 00:46:30,049
connected so much for the gives me an
opportunity to sniff

724
00:46:30,050 --> 00:46:33,370
a as macros a lestat macros

725
00:46:33,370 --> 00:46:37,830
I can do transparent bridge between the
bus hire

726
00:46:37,830 --> 00:46:41,310
and devising a live monitors in billings
now and

727
00:46:41,310 --> 00:46:45,170
bridge with no control it's a more
technical missed me but I'll

728
00:46:45,170 --> 00:46:48,310
saw on this so it's nothing and

729
00:46:48,310 --> 00:46:51,700
I take the wire from

730
00:46:51,700 --> 00:46:55,870
the rx lying on the bus are defined TX
line on the vice

731
00:46:55,870 --> 00:47:00,040
devices now powered all I'm gonna are
gone and Bo

732
00:47:00,040 --> 00:47:05,200
each yet be number one

733
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:08,410
nothing the number two not or

734
00:47:08,410 --> 00:47:15,020
you got something up the number two the

735
00:47:15,020 --> 00:47:19,380
system moving up awesome nah that was
easy

736
00:47:19,380 --> 00:47:22,850
you know it's a very for the record

737
00:47:22,850 --> 00:47:26,210
no we did not I miss that was that
literally was a device

738
00:47:26,210 --> 00:47:30,690
that was just bought a box so we

739
00:47:30,690 --> 00:47:34,030
we we saw that we got the the TX other
device

740
00:47:34,030 --> 00:47:37,210
now we need to find the Arts line and so
we can write

741
00:47:37,210 --> 00:47:41,830
you commence I'm gonna put it on a
bridge mode take the other line

742
00:47:41,830 --> 00:47:45,960
that the TX from the bus fire to the RX
in a device so I have

743
00:47:45,960 --> 00:47:49,510
2 pins that one of them is the CC the
other one is

744
00:47:49,510 --> 00:47:52,970
I'll rx and

745
00:47:52,970 --> 00:47:56,220
remember the CC the battery connector
online somewhere

746
00:47:56,220 --> 00:47:59,280
so Michael E I know this device with a
friend

747
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:03,370
with that the pen and start typing and I
can see it

748
00:48:03,370 --> 00:48:06,390
on the monitor because

749
00:48:06,390 --> 00:48:09,440
I transmit on the bus by I should
receive it back from

750
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:14,110
from the device so I know that was close
and

751
00:48:14,110 --> 00:48:19,000
oh I have a shell what you know

752
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:23,270
super cool you know how to file system

753
00:48:23,270 --> 00:48:28,130
and that completion ball nice you have a
%uh rip romp there so you have a sense

754
00:48:28,130 --> 00:48:29,620
of what use are you probably are

755
00:48:29,620 --> 00:48:32,799
got here yet

756
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:39,800
next and at them just things that

757
00:48:42,940 --> 00:48:49,940
my able be Sony the really interesting
cuz they have no control

758
00:48:51,690 --> 00:48:58,490
jo's can just play with it on see

759
00:48:58,490 --> 00:49:03,450
this one

760
00:49:03,450 --> 00:49:06,829
has star

761
00:49:06,829 --> 00:49:10,510
so

762
00:49:10,510 --> 00:49:14,849
more than 100 is an example you go to
the ww2

763
00:49:14,849 --> 00:49:18,839
and you can see all the while now only
that

764
00:49:18,839 --> 00:49:23,970
you can see all the permissions so these
are

765
00:49:23,970 --> 00:49:27,690
execute minor show you which ones but

766
00:49:27,690 --> 00:49:31,190
there we're

767
00:49:31,190 --> 00:49:34,510
this is a for example because this
embedded systems even is this a better

768
00:49:34,510 --> 00:49:36,020
system in particular shows %um

769
00:49:36,020 --> 00:49:41,780
color very nice so these don't know on

770
00:49:41,780 --> 00:49:45,050
but by being able to see everything the
Weber you can see

771
00:49:45,050 --> 00:49:48,109
all the possible

772
00:49:48,109 --> 00:49:51,500
screens EB interacting with Trey the
official web interface that the device

773
00:49:51,500 --> 00:49:52,670
has you can see

774
00:49:52,670 --> 00:49:56,150
which ones may be available which ones
are going to have more interesting data

775
00:49:56,150 --> 00:49:56,910
in them

776
00:49:56,910 --> 00:49:59,000
which ones are going to have more
interesting commissions if you're

777
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:02,109
looking for cross-site scripting
vulnerabilities a single injection

778
00:50:02,109 --> 00:50:03,520
opportunities

779
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:07,880
command execution opportunities this
nixon casts so much easier

780
00:50:07,880 --> 00:50:11,869
you've got all the source you don't have
to be plainly

781
00:50:11,869 --> 00:50:15,560
scan or use any rituals you can just go
and look at the source and see

782
00:50:15,560 --> 00:50:17,609
everything might possibly want out of it

783
00:50:17,609 --> 00:50:21,328
everything that you know how to do
against a live system the airline

784
00:50:21,329 --> 00:50:22,030
running in

785
00:50:22,030 --> 00:50:25,550
running on you can now do instead of
having to blind people get advice

786
00:50:25,550 --> 00:50:30,190
yeah

787
00:50:30,190 --> 00:50:33,240
the her

788
00:50:33,240 --> 00:50:36,420
there yeah

789
00:50:36,420 --> 00:50:40,720
now you will get stuff like top or
necessarily also left for

790
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:44,680
on any other searched high and things
but yeah I'll

791
00:50:44,680 --> 00:50:47,750
yes you have and and it it's a good
point you're always in see something

792
00:50:47,750 --> 00:50:48,430
interesting

793
00:50:48,430 --> 00:50:52,730
a I is a little it to some extent at
this point this becomes

794
00:50:52,730 --> 00:50:55,970
and exercise in had you explore

795
00:50:55,970 --> 00:51:00,210
a fresh in the connected system have you
explored to assist you just compromised

796
00:51:00,210 --> 00:51:01,140
or the you just

797
00:51:01,140 --> 00:51:04,670
gain control over so you can learn about
and do interesting things to it

798
00:51:04,670 --> 00:51:07,980
and explain filesystem

799
00:51:07,980 --> 00:51:11,640
looking for tools interpreting process
is looking for a crime jobs

800
00:51:11,640 --> 00:51:15,779
looking for key files looking for SSH
files looking for anything like that

801
00:51:15,780 --> 00:51:16,480
those are all

802
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:21,780
reasonable and appropriate tasks you
tell that the

803
00:51:21,780 --> 00:51:26,420
non-volatile RAM you can

804
00:51:26,420 --> 00:51:29,440
we take this device be configured with a
script and

805
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:34,619
so that's the problem so a 10 things
that we've found really useful

806
00:51:34,619 --> 00:51:38,810
is just doing this for pure debugging
purposes be on the watch when we're

807
00:51:38,810 --> 00:51:40,259
fussing something and watch

808
00:51:40,260 --> 00:51:44,640
how it fails and how it crashes and
actually I'll see the logs becomes

809
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:48,049
really useful the you're going to do it

810
00:51:48,050 --> 00:51:51,730
demo the fighting but it ended up taking
longer to run your solidifies test and

811
00:51:51,730 --> 00:51:53,140
we really want to spend in here

812
00:51:53,140 --> 00:51:56,368
we wanted to show you how to use Beach
the

813
00:51:56,369 --> 00:52:00,030
was this device and basically make it
crash a

814
00:52:00,030 --> 00:52:03,150
the problem is it takes about 10 minutes
get no

815
00:52:03,150 --> 00:52:07,670
thats goes up memory and then it crashes
which is worth actually noting these

816
00:52:07,670 --> 00:52:11,450
devices have so little memory that it is
very easy to overload them

817
00:52:11,450 --> 00:52:14,910
another reason why becomes nice to have
this view into them so you can know when

818
00:52:14,910 --> 00:52:18,368
you're pushing too hard you can back off
potentially and have something sings

819
00:52:18,369 --> 00:52:24,099
any other questions

820
00:52:24,099 --> 00:52:27,540
K

821
00:52:27,540 --> 00:52:30,680
this is in our presentation ok this is
been useful to you

822
00:52:30,680 --> 00:52:34,180
a we're going to continue booking at
this a little bit otherwise

823
00:52:34,180 --> 00:52:35,319
if you go thank you
