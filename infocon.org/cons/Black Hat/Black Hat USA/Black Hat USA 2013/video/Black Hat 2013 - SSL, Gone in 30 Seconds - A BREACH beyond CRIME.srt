1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:02,980
we are going to present something
different today so hopefully you guys

2
00:00:02,980 --> 00:00:04,210
will forgive us our

3
00:00:04,210 --> 00:00:09,190
while continuous all gone in 60 seconds
and

4
00:00:09,190 --> 00:00:15,379
for I'll so of higher on nom I'm the
alzheimer security engineer square

5
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:20,170
hi I me i la Mosca research on
Salesforce

6
00:00:20,170 --> 00:00:23,720
101 and slow laundry and cheddar cheese

7
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:29,238
oh yeah security two years so I'll try
and get started so

8
00:00:29,239 --> 00:00:34,230
some you know that I love our talks I'm
but are you doing today so

9
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:38,460
some the agenda for today's talk is we
are first if you haven't figured out

10
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:39,020
from

11
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:42,739
the title the talk great tell you a
little bit about crime an awesome attack

12
00:00:42,739 --> 00:00:45,960
announced a la Sept at attack a party

13
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:49,219
so if you get in contact there before we
can understand our work

14
00:00:49,219 --> 00:00:52,640
tracking on crime we're gonna go ahead
and

15
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:59,260
talk about our work which were calling
breach so then we're going to force you

16
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:01,649
all to suffer through the technical
details

17
00:01:01,649 --> 00:01:06,180
love our work and that's going to take a
while but the good news is after diver

18
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:07,490
going to show you as a demo

19
00:01:07,490 --> 00:01:10,979
the attack and finally we will I will
finish up

20
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:15,590
with some potential many Asians for
breach South that's where we're going

21
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:19,860
let's go and get started so

22
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:24,310
what happened with crime i'm for those
of you that I remember back in September

23
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:28,000
Jr is on tied long announced a a really
cool

24
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,290
attack that which they called crime I'm
and the idea was they were going to

25
00:01:32,290 --> 00:01:33,990
target secrets which were an

26
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:37,149
HDPE requests hatter's okay

27
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:41,000
I'm using a compression side-channel I'm
the requirements for their tax

28
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,110
where they needed to. la sala
compression on emphasize that man the

29
00:01:45,110 --> 00:01:47,730
man also need to measure traffic the
size the traffic

30
00:01:47,730 --> 00:01:51,070
and course someone had to use a browser
some point to make this work

31
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:54,800
so again seekers in a Stevie request

32
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:58,320
headers okay so what

33
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:01,640
was the Oracle what were the details of
the attack I'll actually work

34
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:07,200
solo the thing about as a sales it
doesn't actually hide the length of the

35
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,878
underlying claim tax that's one

36
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:13,879
important thing for all this to
recognize as a South and speedy

37
00:02:13,879 --> 00:02:17,390
actually have an option to compress
hatter's you can use a compression

38
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:17,980
setting in

39
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:23,649
tell us a lot actually compress hatter's
so a crime

40
00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:26,800
does is it issues requests with every
possible character

41
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:31,440
for the target secret and measures the
resulting Seifert ex-lax

42
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:37,520
know what you're looking for is you're
looking for the plane tax which

43
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,740
compresses the most

44
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:42,050
and whichever one that is that
corresponds to the gas

45
00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:45,120
with the correct sorry the request with
the correct gas

46
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,350
okay and that allows you to guess the
secret bye bye bye

47
00:02:48,350 --> 00:02:52,350
so I always makes I'm Hollywood for you
have those movies we're guessing the pen

48
00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:53,799
or whatever one pilot I'm

49
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:58,980
well the current gonna party rights on
and I

50
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:02,440
what one foreign thing also it is does
require a small booth shot in sequence

51
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:04,510
so you have to have a unknown prefix

52
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:08,540
in order to get the compression to to
start matching up the attackers gas

53
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:14,870
with the target seeker crime so

54
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:19,380
house impression actually work soldiers
when quick one slide over the Hoover

55
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:22,459
are a reminder so we can have a dollar
heads as we go forward

56
00:03:22,459 --> 00:03:26,260
so deflate and dollars france je za

57
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:30,569
Zealand cetera I'm has two parts to it
the first is all the 77

58
00:03:30,569 --> 00:03:33,569
and that's the part that that we like
that makes the attack actually work

59
00:03:33,569 --> 00:03:37,940
and it reduces redundancy in strings so
for example have a string like googling

60
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:38,959
to Google's

61
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:42,430
you have the string 00 GL twice in their
so

62
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:46,630
as a writing down 00 GL twice why not
just take the second instance and use a

63
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:47,269
pointer

64
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:51,240
their first back to the earlier one so
in this case then the resulting

65
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:55,120
compressed tax you would have a
five-pointer which is a distance and

66
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:55,770
links pair

67
00:03:55,770 --> 00:03:59,130
so the -13 says go back 13 characters

68
00:03:59,130 --> 00:04:02,400
and a4 says for Pete for from there K

69
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:05,380
so that's the part that we're actually
taking advantage of the crime takes

70
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:06,220
advantage of

71
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:10,910
to gas a target seeker but one more part
unfortunately

72
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:14,910
was actually a is pretty annoying for
the doctor at something on top in coding

73
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:18,149
and have been coding or slightly
differently it's going to take common

74
00:04:18,149 --> 00:04:18,918
bytes

75
00:04:18,918 --> 00:04:22,810
so it's just a single bite is getting
the entire document as and take the most

76
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:24,900
common bites and replace them with
shorter

77
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:27,949
codes so for example you can see in a
little table here

78
00:04:27,949 --> 00:04:32,110
if the character spacer a as those who
are the most common characters in your

79
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:32,840
document

80
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:35,860
the my replace those with just the three
best sequence

81
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:40,279
and maybe less common characters like I
don't know 0 for whatever

82
00:04:40,279 --> 00:04:43,930
you be willing to use assay formats are
more to encode

83
00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:48,550
so I'm without telling exactly while I
causes problems

84
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:51,819
just keeping your hands for now it
causes a lot of pain will tell you why

85
00:04:51,819 --> 00:04:55,719
later

86
00:04:55,719 --> 00:04:58,840
sour what happened in September

87
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:02,689
so after the author's a crime show their
demo

88
00:05:02,689 --> 00:05:05,800
everyone sir said well okay that's cool
but

89
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:08,969
all you have to do the disabled de la
sala compression

90
00:05:08,969 --> 00:05:12,860
and everything is fine so all the major
right us from all securities on seaside

91
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:14,740
turn of the last impression

92
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:18,550
browsers on most browsers on any news
anyway who cares that moves on

93
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:22,309
arm we actually when we initially
contacted sir with our work that was our

94
00:05:22,309 --> 00:05:23,770
first response also

95
00:05:23,770 --> 00:05:28,549
I'm so all the experts are telling us
that sex right so

96
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:32,559
which is just all go home everything's
fine yes locks and everything

97
00:05:32,559 --> 00:05:36,650
guarantees choose our secure right

98
00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:39,879
so we're here to question that and no

99
00:05:39,879 --> 00:05:44,240
we don't degree so on the point our talk
today

100
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:48,120
is to remind people for small the
original crime authors you look at their

101
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:50,629
talk take a look at slides 38 340

102
00:05:50,629 --> 00:05:54,559
they actually more in the service known
seem to listen we lessons

103
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:57,870
absorbing the sack gotta lie for showing
you that it's a real thing you can still

104
00:05:57,870 --> 00:05:58,900
be exploited today

105
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:02,349
right now

106
00:06:02,349 --> 00:06:06,558
okay but before we actually before too
long ago and correct the record

107
00:06:06,559 --> 00:06:10,080
let's go had no change the Wikipedia
page to make sure that

108
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:16,568
everything's actor and Angela

109
00:06:16,569 --> 00:06:23,569
well

110
00:06:25,090 --> 00:06:32,090
well

111
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:37,530
all

112
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:42,030
your maybe something at a citation
during the talk to be nice

113
00:06:42,030 --> 00:06:46,760
thanks on artful

114
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:50,830
there alright

115
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:55,039
Kingdom okay thanks alright so there we
go

116
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:58,940
so today we're here to tell you about

117
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:02,719
are working even into within our company
for last few months for calling a breach

118
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:06,860
arm so one of the hardest things more
workers figure out an acronym which is

119
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:07,990
cool I crime

120
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:12,200
which actually made sense and so well
and I'm reach and breach stands for

121
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:15,770
Alan how long did a process that nothing
was more work in his ears

122
00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:19,270
it was a long night a went 17 them you
know both got

123
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:23,280
yeah I was lower interest as your
browser icons international Treasury a

124
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:26,780
doctor's professional hyper tax-free
koolhaas yeah

125
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:30,430
okay so what is breeze though why does
this all work

126
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:34,020
and in a nutshell for breaches

127
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:37,130
is the crime attacked against the
response body

128
00:07:37,130 --> 00:07:41,300
sir member crime the initial demo was
against request headers

129
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:44,310
okay one bridges

130
00:07:44,310 --> 00:07:48,430
is the same idea but against secrets
that are actually in the response body

131
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:52,229
so you guys go and use the internet here
you guys going use the Internet

132
00:07:52,229 --> 00:07:56,200
okay and you will use a web application
you'll find that is very common

133
00:07:56,200 --> 00:08:00,000
to compress all sorts of stuff in our
sponsors

134
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,810
okay if you don't you're going to be
paying look probably a bigger bill

135
00:08:03,810 --> 00:08:07,180
okay to me it's a big difference in
performance but

136
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:11,340
we think that that's not always such a
good idea and hopefully by the end the

137
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:12,729
talk will convince do that

138
00:08:12,729 --> 00:08:16,000
want in compression damage to your
sponsors is %uh

139
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,240
is dangerous so just a gala

140
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:23,690
for example how's it going to happen so
the top is a spear quests where the

141
00:08:23,690 --> 00:08:24,800
client is telling at

142
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:28,860
the server that accepts Jesus in the
flame coatings and the bottom shows

143
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:34,180
I response wherein the the body is
actually from prices in Jesus campsites

144
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:37,610
pretty common PSE all over the place
some now

145
00:08:37,610 --> 00:08:41,530
what are the ingredients for the attack
what do we need for breached actually

146
00:08:41,530 --> 00:08:42,000
work

147
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,140
well first of all we need compression K

148
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:49,080
that's kind of key here arm but like I
said before it's very prevalent loss

149
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,470
about applications you said

150
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:55,089
and thus a working as any browser are
the second bullet

151
00:08:55,089 --> 00:08:58,209
this is not strictly requirement but
does may be attacked

152
00:08:58,209 --> 00:09:02,209
faster and easier for us we need the
pages to be somewhat stable

153
00:09:02,209 --> 00:09:06,070
okay what I mean by stable is out the
responses don't change too much

154
00:09:06,070 --> 00:09:10,720
from request a request I and with a
stable

155
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:13,870
%ah with a stable page with the target
seeker thereafter

156
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:17,100
we can actually exceed the attack under
30 seconds sometimes

157
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:22,080
cylinder today my the sixty next we
still need

158
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:25,480
about to be able to measure the victims
trafficked so we're gonna have to man

159
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:27,450
the middle them in Houston traffic
flowing through us

160
00:09:27,450 --> 00:09:30,900
I'm or not tampering with the actual as
a cell connection

161
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:34,240
we're not gonna downgrade you too you
know lower cipher suite or anything like

162
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:34,600
that

163
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:38,570
when you see her in the response body

164
00:09:38,570 --> 00:09:42,240
I'm so the first one comes to mind from
Aziz policies are token

165
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:45,750
I could be used data could be you know
something else I really anything in

166
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:47,920
response body that an attacker but wants

167
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:53,089
to get we need an attacker supplies

168
00:09:53,089 --> 00:09:56,940
gas so some user input to be reflected
in the response body

169
00:09:56,940 --> 00:10:00,650
we still need a

170
00:10:00,650 --> 00:10:04,699
whose shot in sequence like that we
measure for with crime three characters

171
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:08,209
somebody need and finally this is
exactly require everyone emphasizes

172
00:10:08,209 --> 00:10:09,600
works for any version

173
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:13,700
the TA Las and SRS assault with whatever
options you liked

174
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:17,480
so at this point I go and handed over to
Angela

175
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:21,050
and talk about

176
00:10:21,050 --> 00:10:28,050
summer the details at the time but
answer

177
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:32,449
here we have an example for any target
application

178
00:10:32,450 --> 00:10:35,959
and you can see that there's a what if I
candidates

179
00:10:35,959 --> 00:10:39,800
excellence and there's a secret and
response body

180
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:42,950
week on Canada's his call cary and it's
a hex

181
00:10:42,950 --> 00:10:46,420
secret 32 character slant and

182
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:50,699
here's a gas now the gas comes from the
URL it's just the printer to get

183
00:10:50,699 --> 00:10:51,970
reflected on the page

184
00:10:51,970 --> 00:10:55,550
%uh so we going to go after Dodd
particular guess

185
00:10:55,550 --> 00:10:58,959
now breach what is the

186
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:02,000
architecture from bridge so there's four
components there's for

187
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,640
critical pieces in breach we have a we
can make them

188
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:10,150
we have an attacker the attack and
everything happened to be in the same

189
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:10,790
network

190
00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:15,250
undersea common control center which
typically is operated by the attacker

191
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:18,579
been holding off and all the other
Britons banana common controls our

192
00:11:18,579 --> 00:11:19,850
community known as well

193
00:11:19,850 --> 00:11:23,260
bed i win eighty see to traffic on the
network

194
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:26,620
and 102 and and soul connection

195
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:31,650
32 to use all the way to you the target
server

196
00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:34,860
South a high-level standpoint the common
control center

197
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:37,890
this is what we have we have a one
summer

198
00:11:37,890 --> 00:11:40,980
driver 41 but just an iframe streamer

199
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:44,470
which is going to change i payloads that
are going to trigger

200
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:48,100
it's two people question the victim or
tenderness I can't I we have and another

201
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:49,280
summer

202
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:52,990
according to which the call I whence I
will be

203
00:11:52,990 --> 00:11:57,780
call by why and their responses come
alive to convict him

204
00:11:57,780 --> 00:12:00,880
an aneurysm and mental component we have
some

205
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:05,400
Oracle logical on do all the different
algorithms that we will see a few

206
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:06,530
seconds

207
00:12:06,530 --> 00:12:09,880
and Anders traffic monitor was simply
absurd alive

208
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:13,990
this item tax coming by and hundreds
more advance

209
00:12:13,990 --> 00:12:17,240
control on lodging wins are

210
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:20,560
it's in the engine and of course is 100
percent secure because we built it

211
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:23,579
so prior Sarah

212
00:12:23,579 --> 00:12:26,870
seems a logical we have many middle

213
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:30,550
for small I we want to try

214
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:34,480
it's basically is a transparent us all
realize how to hustle proxy we just

215
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:35,690
basically

216
00:12:35,690 --> 00:12:39,829
past traffic from one sock it to NASCAR
next one from 15 to the next one

217
00:12:39,829 --> 00:12:43,390
and have an edge the mountains for
controller with the AC Milan judge

218
00:12:43,390 --> 00:12:48,400
controller will do is it will generate
requests that are now complete argument

219
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:52,480
to the independent victims because now
Jamaicans are created equal

220
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:56,079
that's the view by the stock on it in
Jax

221
00:12:56,079 --> 00:13:00,470
image requests on tonight frank which
for the browser to performing

222
00:13:00,470 --> 00:13:04,150
HTTP requests now those are just a few
quests

223
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:07,430
they will fail eventually getting on
actual images home when they fail is

224
00:13:07,430 --> 00:13:10,699
because they completed so the actual
question response 13

225
00:13:10,699 --> 00:13:13,750
I and logically insurers and demand

226
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:17,610
and it's getting on our which is
measured response is:

227
00:13:17,610 --> 00:13:20,699
I now there's logic on a server

228
00:13:20,699 --> 00:13:24,079
sigh with us or you know common control
so this was the Johnston partner there

229
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:24,780
see

230
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:29,250
we have a bye harry and with a minor
areas as the common control driver

231
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:33,319
now the drivers responsible for
coordinating character in essence and

232
00:13:33,319 --> 00:13:35,410
answer will try and personal character

233
00:13:35,410 --> 00:13:39,890
know when I just want to move to the
next one so we hume one by one

234
00:13:39,890 --> 00:13:45,240
animal issue requests in hand which side
and what what are you talking and

235
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:49,180
on he will listen to just a call at some
point Northwest finish the brosser the

236
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:51,709
russian election week went on to become
a control center

237
00:13:51,709 --> 00:13:54,880
will say hey Prosser case armor

238
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:59,040
anything you southern wire knows me idle
questions on

239
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:02,540
anything yourself and this particular
destination IP tonight arty

240
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:05,990
I just go ahead and Masha red I Somesh

241
00:14:05,990 --> 00:14:10,130
I could land and then has unknown
intelligence for

242
00:14:10,130 --> 00:14:14,209
I'm you know runtime: recovery with what
that means is sometimes we hear issues

243
00:14:14,209 --> 00:14:17,310
sometimes we make mistakes but this time
haha we're not allowed to make mistakes

244
00:14:17,310 --> 00:14:19,010
Kissimmee

245
00:14:19,010 --> 00:14:23,010
because it relies on compression we
cannot continue so if we make it today

246
00:14:23,010 --> 00:14:26,970
we have all the reasons that are able to
the tax we missed a handful of

247
00:14:26,970 --> 00:14:30,280
and Washoe ninety seconds arch to the
Oracle

248
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:33,920
the article in the March on yes the
black gloss

249
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:37,819
as the mystical PSNR a cock

250
00:14:37,819 --> 00:14:40,829
I just measures the size held between
different requests

251
00:14:40,829 --> 00:14:45,120
so the size difference between even
sorry between responses

252
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:48,490
I will guess my my my it's a white
character at a time

253
00:14:48,490 --> 00:14:53,079
animal control their recovery if there's
you know any issues a one-out

254
00:14:53,079 --> 00:14:57,920
I cell was lookin essential for a few
seconds so

255
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:02,910
what's the problem with SSL are all the
problem is as a saul does not Highlands

256
00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:06,929
so you have to make time he have a
target server recesses of my kids

257
00:15:06,929 --> 00:15:10,209
request/response Paris climbing for

258
00:15:10,209 --> 00:15:14,120
nitrous outlet the they should be clear
tax

259
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:17,949
I listen stream cipher since equivalent
it's the same

260
00:15:17,949 --> 00:15:21,209
you know after you check in online is
taking care of it's exactly the same as

261
00:15:21,209 --> 00:15:22,230
the SS all

262
00:15:22,230 --> 00:15:27,900
side for tax so on the size of the
underlying plain text is the same size

263
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:29,150
as the its after-tax

264
00:15:29,150 --> 00:15:32,439
on this case we have an example 10 by
its as less likely

265
00:15:32,439 --> 00:15:35,709
like an example the compression Oracle
I'm

266
00:15:35,709 --> 00:15:40,480
she we had eighty gas prices we have a
gas futures

267
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:45,689
super-secret super Seacrest a national
targets super-secret

268
00:15:45,689 --> 00:15:50,699
2x in Las characters in crack so
compression to your following

269
00:15:50,699 --> 00:15:55,429
you can see none and the 101 but I would
compressions can do is gonna play super

270
00:15:55,429 --> 00:15:56,500
secret

271
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:59,870
we have eighty can replace I would've
corner right

272
00:15:59,870 --> 00:16:04,170
back to the original secret so because
there's repetition whatever's repeat

273
00:16:04,170 --> 00:16:06,030
initial plays violin player

274
00:16:06,030 --> 00:16:09,589
but because the axe was anchoring gas
because she dnt

275
00:16:09,589 --> 00:16:12,640
mister an axe the actual not getting
depressed

276
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:15,819
because it is not too much so the
compression is only within

277
00:16:15,819 --> 00:16:19,839
the source tree much hopefully I make
sense so we open for you guys to three

278
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:20,610
invites

279
00:16:20,610 --> 00:16:23,670
with a 10-mile compression now

280
00:16:23,670 --> 00:16:28,559
interest in Hexham is an anti rice we
want a tree a whole lot of bad

281
00:16:28,559 --> 00:16:32,339
I the kids basically targeted difference
than actually having tea

282
00:16:32,339 --> 00:16:36,280
guess what the whole team will compress
prices super-secret

283
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:41,030
which is the and how much gas want to
press against the actual get on the page

284
00:16:41,030 --> 00:16:42,760
the actual secret page

285
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:46,699
it hoping compress as we go down eleven
by its we go from forty in my eyes 237

286
00:16:46,699 --> 00:16:47,790
bytes

287
00:16:47,790 --> 00:16:50,819
the Miami think I can is as great as a
low-end what does this have to do with

288
00:16:50,819 --> 00:16:53,860
bridge well it turns out that if you
look at the previous slide

289
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:58,079
when they decry secret we have 30 mins
with the cracked Seacrest

290
00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:02,689
map 37 miles now being whiny France

291
00:17:02,689 --> 00:17:06,609
done one by a difference is what makes
reach possible

292
00:17:06,610 --> 00:17:10,610
because we can't tell which is the
correct one which was is the correct one

293
00:17:10,610 --> 00:17:14,579
the all safety begins with you taken
over

294
00:17:14,579 --> 00:17:17,879
so after talking about the Oracle I

295
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:21,189
want to talk a little about the

296
00:17:21,189 --> 00:17:25,350
son son I'll on talk a little about some
robots we had

297
00:17:25,349 --> 00:17:29,620
and Ikes Melamed what they wrote these
roadblocks R&R how do we r work around

298
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:30,700
them

299
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:34,320
so the first robot that we hit was our
Huffman coding

300
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:38,200
as I mentioned before compression is
built up two components

301
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:42,260
the first component his eldest 77077 as
is

302
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:45,940
is the key that's all we want alan is
only seven compressors

303
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:50,010
repeated string against each other so we
have repeated strange we know

304
00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:53,059
that it will compress well so if we
guessed correct the see CREF

305
00:17:53,059 --> 00:17:55,570
it will compress well in our overall
deal to determine what's the correct

306
00:17:55,570 --> 00:17:56,909
guess

307
00:17:56,910 --> 00:18:00,070
Huffman coding and other hand is now
really our friend happen coding what it

308
00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:00,760
tries to do

309
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:05,870
and then compression is find characters
are very common like me explain before

310
00:18:05,870 --> 00:18:09,880
and replace those common bites with
shorter sequences

311
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:12,880
the problem with that is that when your
place

312
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:16,809
common by Swiss or sequences that also
compresses overall size in with that

313
00:18:16,809 --> 00:18:19,110
compresses overall size something
smaller

314
00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:22,130
Oracle compressions now confused because
it doesn't know why was compressed too

315
00:18:22,130 --> 00:18:23,780
small I just knows it's smaller

316
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:28,629
so the question is why is a smaller is a
small because a Allen 77 which is

317
00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:32,490
something that indicates a match in our
strange more than just because their

318
00:18:32,490 --> 00:18:35,110
characters very common in the response
and therefore

319
00:18:35,110 --> 00:18:38,610
that is causing the response to be
smaller so we really don't like of

320
00:18:38,610 --> 00:18:39,440
encoding

321
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:43,830
my 12 yr so Disney about that but for
now we have to deal with it

322
00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:47,260
so let's take a look at it very concrete
example and see how this happen calling

323
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:48,429
affects our

324
00:18:48,429 --> 00:18:52,299
are case so in this case I'll

325
00:18:52,299 --> 00:18:55,379
we have a response star has a secret in
it

326
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:58,580
now we're trying to get some characters

327
00:18:58,580 --> 00:19:02,360
weary guest for BF in our secret and
we're trying to get stuff

328
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:06,490
fourth character and in this case the
fourth character the correct fourth

329
00:19:06,490 --> 00:19:07,970
character would be be

330
00:19:07,970 --> 00:19:11,450
so after we try different characters and
we try the character be

331
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:15,320
oracle CEO B is correct because the
response I seems to be a little bit

332
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:17,110
smaller compresses better

333
00:19:17,110 --> 00:19:20,559
so now we continue right now what
happens next what happens next as we try

334
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:23,670
another character in this case a which
will prolly tried before but

335
00:19:23,670 --> 00:19:28,920
that's fine so we try a and we get the
same response as when a response 1350 a

336
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:30,090
bite as well

337
00:19:30,090 --> 00:19:33,870
soul from NorCal perspective Merkle
doesn't know why you got the same

338
00:19:33,870 --> 00:19:37,890
small response times why compresses well
just knows compresses well

339
00:19:37,890 --> 00:19:41,120
soul is a compress as well as things
well that's probably a winner

340
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:44,480
however in this case a compressed well
not because the characters crack now

341
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:46,970
because a compressed against another
string

342
00:19:46,970 --> 00:19:50,360
a rather because it was just a very
common character a appeared many many

343
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:51,900
times in a response body

344
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:55,429
and therefore of encoding cause it to be
a very very small

345
00:19:55,429 --> 00:19:59,730
their presentation so they both appear
to be the same response eyes

346
00:19:59,730 --> 00:20:02,890
and how do we know which one is the
winner so that that's our southern

347
00:20:02,890 --> 00:20:04,940
neighbors that we had with often coding
and a

348
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:08,080
and rainy weather will try to play with
this probably I was one lol the first

349
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:10,610
thing that is sure to come up

350
00:20:10,610 --> 00:20:14,179
so what do we do about a house they were
not gonna some reach home wanna try to

351
00:20:14,179 --> 00:20:15,429
deal with our

352
00:20:15,429 --> 00:20:18,690
so we had a few things that we did the
first thing that we did is two tries to

353
00:20:18,690 --> 00:20:20,850
try is not something new that we
invented two tries

354
00:20:20,850 --> 00:20:24,710
was already mentioned and crime and were
two tries does is a very simple approach

355
00:20:24,710 --> 00:20:28,210
that would try to eliminate the fact so
hartman coding and allow the Oracle to

356
00:20:28,210 --> 00:20:29,049
detect

357
00:20:29,049 --> 00:20:32,350
the compression the response size is
small because

358
00:20:32,350 --> 00:20:35,640
avails the seventy-seven because our
petition in the strange

359
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:40,410
their matches to the secret the weather
does that is sans to request for every

360
00:20:40,410 --> 00:20:43,790
guess character there was two guests
allies are trying to get in this case

361
00:20:43,790 --> 00:20:48,090
the number seven we want to see if seven
is correct so we're going to do

362
00:20:48,090 --> 00:20:51,240
we're going to send a once just after
the characters already know they're

363
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:54,470
ready yes before let's assume you ready
yes those characters

364
00:20:54,470 --> 00:20:58,150
and we're gonna put seven so we have for
me ask

365
00:20:58,150 --> 00:21:01,390
know we have seven and we have some
random padding that would put him there

366
00:21:01,390 --> 00:21:03,070
to just offer it out on the rest either

367
00:21:03,070 --> 00:21:06,990
data so will get a response will measure
it

368
00:21:06,990 --> 00:21:10,750
and there was another request the second
try and over there will put the number

369
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:11,400
seven

370
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:15,059
after that product so we have four me a
padding

371
00:21:15,059 --> 00:21:18,149
and then seven and we measure the
difference between those two

372
00:21:18,150 --> 00:21:21,590
that sticky because if we have a
difference between these two

373
00:21:21,590 --> 00:21:24,949
nah mean is because %uh Valley 77 if the
war

374
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:28,690
that we got a small size because I love
Huffman coding

375
00:21:28,690 --> 00:21:32,669
there should be no reason why these two
should group result in a different sides

376
00:21:32,669 --> 00:21:36,559
so if we do have a different size we
know that's because well the 77

377
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:40,428
I which is if you would have been close
to compress along a secret

378
00:21:40,429 --> 00:21:43,790
if it's far after the padding it does
not compress against the secret

379
00:21:43,790 --> 00:21:47,020
over that make sense the second thing
that we tried

380
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:51,049
car his character several again we're
still trying to fight half including

381
00:21:51,049 --> 00:21:55,210
some charges a $4 trying to do is for
every guest or going to send every quest

382
00:21:55,210 --> 00:21:56,250
or going to send

383
00:21:56,250 --> 00:21:59,760
we're going to put all the characters
fall the alphabet

384
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:03,650
from our secret let us know have a
secret has a has a hex a secret any

385
00:22:03,650 --> 00:22:07,429
or sequel isn't our index up and Excise
gonna be

386
00:22:07,429 --> 00:22:10,679
age is easier to nine so we're going to
do is we're gonna put an entire also

387
00:22:10,679 --> 00:22:12,100
been every quest

388
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:15,880
and as we want to get a specific
character we're going to move a

389
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:19,640
out of the guest position alotta the
characters a pool and move it into the

390
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:20,790
US position

391
00:22:20,790 --> 00:22:23,799
was essential allows us to do it allows
us to

392
00:22:23,799 --> 00:22:27,280
not changed Huffman coding have a
coating will stay basically the same

393
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:27,950
across

394
00:22:27,950 --> 00:22:31,480
def requests so only thing that changes
across request is gonna be

395
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:35,730
the location of that character and the
occasional only a fact LZ 77 and not

396
00:22:35,730 --> 00:22:37,020
happen coding

397
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:39,720
so that helps us a little bit to
determine what's the correct guess um

398
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:43,610
what's just happened coding falling and
NorCal

399
00:22:43,610 --> 00:22:49,570
so now the first row lock we had a few
more

400
00:22:49,570 --> 00:22:53,220
the second as as we're trying to guess
characters

401
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:57,270
sometimes we have different issues and
the two main issues day we're gonna have

402
00:22:57,270 --> 00:22:58,540
some high-level

403
00:22:58,540 --> 00:23:01,610
are must assume we're trying to get
different characters

404
00:23:01,610 --> 00:23:06,130
and we get no winners meaning we define
a winner as a character that Oracle

405
00:23:06,130 --> 00:23:07,490
tells us that the correct

406
00:23:07,490 --> 00:23:12,360
gas for secret soul we have no inner
snorkel does not seem to suggest that

407
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:14,400
any character is the correct

408
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:17,559
character from The Secret so what do we
do about that

409
00:23:17,559 --> 00:23:20,490
the second thing is if we have too many
winners meaning we have too many

410
00:23:20,490 --> 00:23:22,919
characters as we guessed and Oracle
suggests

411
00:23:22,919 --> 00:23:28,980
the dad is the correct character for
this location a secret

412
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:31,820
the first thing that we did to solve
these problems as look ahead instead of

413
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:35,340
getting one character at a time we just
do two characters at a time

414
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:39,379
so instead I'm guessing a in B&C and see
which one of them is correct

415
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:42,970
was going to AA AB AC know that
something more expensive

416
00:23:42,970 --> 00:23:46,019
but it has to be more liable especially
in these cases where we had no winners

417
00:23:46,019 --> 00:23:48,649
are too many winners

418
00:23:48,649 --> 00:23:52,740
now let's assume we went down the road
and we are tried and some somewhere down

419
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:55,669
the road we see that something doesn't
look right we're not getting any winners

420
00:23:55,669 --> 00:23:57,399
were trying a bunch of tricks

421
00:23:57,399 --> 00:24:00,340
and we'll talk more about some other
tricks but but no matter what we do

422
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:02,289
we're kinda stuck nothing is

423
00:24:02,289 --> 00:24:06,750
compressing while and I get so use a
roll-back we roll back to last known

424
00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:10,019
location a conflict so fasten conflict
when multiple characters appear to be

425
00:24:10,019 --> 00:24:11,259
winners the one was

426
00:24:11,259 --> 00:24:14,960
stronger than another we start with a
stronger and then if there's late on

427
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:15,769
down initial

428
00:24:15,769 --> 00:24:19,759
we go we roll back to the conflict

429
00:24:19,759 --> 00:24:23,179
another thing that we had is let's
assume that we have a

430
00:24:23,179 --> 00:24:26,409
a secret that has inside the secret ABC

431
00:24:26,409 --> 00:24:30,820
baby one what happened in that case is
is we have something that will lead us

432
00:24:30,820 --> 00:24:35,570
to cause compression against the guest
itself not against the real secret

433
00:24:35,570 --> 00:24:39,340
what happens if you have a secret again
ABC baby

434
00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:43,620
and then we're trying to guess that's
six character that is supposed to be one

435
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:47,159
we're starting to rotate through gases
were going avec

436
00:24:47,159 --> 00:24:53,200
one drop what can happen is both see and
one will suggest that those are correct

437
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:56,710
guesses those are both winners the
reason for that is this

438
00:24:56,710 --> 00:24:59,649
the one will be cracked because the
compressible against secret the correct

439
00:24:59,649 --> 00:25:01,049
the real secret

440
00:25:01,049 --> 00:25:03,889
and the sea will show a bus crash
because it compresses against the gas

441
00:25:03,889 --> 00:25:04,980
itself

442
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:07,789
so how to identify how to identify
between those two were compressing as

443
00:25:07,789 --> 00:25:09,720
the seagram was just a sub

444
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:12,870
pattern within the gas itself so

445
00:25:12,870 --> 00:25:16,070
as a tyler is just as pretty simple
we're doing is we're doing a compression

446
00:25:16,070 --> 00:25:17,168
ratio

447
00:25:17,169 --> 00:25:21,289
on the gas itself and let's assume they
were talking about secrets if it's not

448
00:25:21,289 --> 00:25:24,450
seekers and is now random them we don't
need to talk about this

449
00:25:24,450 --> 00:25:28,220
sort on my real true random Seacrest or
trying to extract

450
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:31,929
and if insurance either through probably
shouldn't have secrets that are

451
00:25:31,929 --> 00:25:35,570
really good seekers a compressed well
against themselves that there's some

452
00:25:35,570 --> 00:25:38,830
significant patterns going on in there
soul which is if a

453
00:25:38,830 --> 00:25:42,699
and if we see that compresses well we
can assume that's probably wrong

454
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:48,320
we dropped our character and we're left
with one which is correct

455
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:53,100
another problem they were facing his you
are Elaine HTML including

456
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:57,340
I in the page so in reality a lot of
times he's talkin laissez un you

457
00:25:57,340 --> 00:26:00,679
mentioned before for example might be
going after Caesar's token

458
00:26:00,679 --> 00:26:04,779
a Caesar talkin typically will be let
into form post say so the formula feel

459
00:26:04,779 --> 00:26:05,960
input field

460
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:09,710
and you'll have value equals and some
quotes are ever so let's show let's take

461
00:26:09,710 --> 00:26:11,669
a look at example beer

462
00:26:11,669 --> 00:26:15,690
so as you can see in this example I'm
you how their Caesar told him but it's

463
00:26:15,690 --> 00:26:18,669
but it's hidden inside a value equals
quotes and the problem is if we're going

464
00:26:18,669 --> 00:26:21,929
to try to get a quote into the response
body

465
00:26:21,929 --> 00:26:25,720
is probably been coated if it's not him
in coded and there's probably access on

466
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:26,519
that page so

467
00:26:26,519 --> 00:26:30,340
I don't think we need to reach for that
so so are suing their that that

468
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:34,679
quote is encoded in schools and coded
then in this case where we're sort of

469
00:26:34,679 --> 00:26:35,549
stock so

470
00:26:35,549 --> 00:26:38,940
this is a robot actually that would not
have a solution it's kinda limitation

471
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:42,960
so if you put your secrets in places
where the gas

472
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:46,370
getting coated in a way that it cannot
bootstrap essentially an get to the

473
00:26:46,370 --> 00:26:47,539
seeker location

474
00:26:47,539 --> 00:26:50,769
we will not be able to bootstrap and
start to compress character a character

475
00:26:50,769 --> 00:26:54,409
against the real secret

476
00:26:54,409 --> 00:26:58,009
and some or all locks soul

477
00:26:58,009 --> 00:27:01,799
so far we started with a fairly simple
example we said that every bite

478
00:27:01,799 --> 00:27:05,418
in the side in the clear tax will will
indicate a bite in the cipher tax

479
00:27:05,419 --> 00:27:08,990
now that's not always the case it in the
block cipher that my number you get so

480
00:27:08,990 --> 00:27:10,950
so why is that let's let's take a look
at

481
00:27:10,950 --> 00:27:14,970
stream ciphers a block cipher and stream
cipher

482
00:27:14,970 --> 00:27:19,409
it's pretty straightforward streams
overall reveal exact lengths

483
00:27:19,409 --> 00:27:22,789
love the clean on the cleartext so if
you have ten my stint

484
00:27:22,789 --> 00:27:27,399
by 10 HDPE let's assume it's compressed
I doesn't matter because the clear taxed

485
00:27:27,399 --> 00:27:30,690
that ten buys will be exactly 10 bytes

486
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:34,970
cipher text so then if your article
looks at the size and knows exactly what

487
00:27:34,970 --> 00:27:36,870
was your length of your clear text

488
00:27:36,870 --> 00:27:41,450
however mmm block cipher mode that's not
the case black server motors will know

489
00:27:41,450 --> 00:27:44,559
it's always gonna be some job lock sites
so let's say we have eased fears

490
00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:46,120
sponsors 10 bytes

491
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:50,159
they getting corrupted we have now 16
bytes whether or not we had 10 or 11

492
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:51,509
bite inside over there

493
00:27:51,509 --> 00:27:55,049
NorCal not see that so that Kyle in
historical

494
00:27:55,049 --> 00:27:58,370
so what do we do about this

495
00:27:58,370 --> 00:28:01,850
all we need to do to overcome this
problem was to align the response body

496
00:28:01,850 --> 00:28:04,750
before we try to even guess the
characters

497
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:08,750
to them block cipher basically we just
add more characters

498
00:28:08,750 --> 00:28:12,009
causing the page to be in a position
where any additional

499
00:28:12,009 --> 00:28:15,029
uncompress a bye-bye all caused output

500
00:28:15,029 --> 00:28:19,259
to overflow into the next block cipher
to the next block

501
00:28:19,259 --> 00:28:23,379
I now we get to that position if we
start to his characters if it's correct

502
00:28:23,379 --> 00:28:27,340
will compress well anyone over flow to
the next block if it's incorrect

503
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:30,840
the lower flow in and then we have these
are all being able to see that

504
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:35,919
did overflow or not physically will have
16 bytes difference that have one

505
00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:40,629
now let's assume we start to guess now
will I know is starting his characters

506
00:28:40,629 --> 00:28:44,289
so we're guessing the character we got a
winner want to add a if we had a

507
00:28:44,289 --> 00:28:48,220
sometimes all still causal I men's to go
off

508
00:28:48,220 --> 00:28:51,460
and when the alarm goes off it goes off
a tipping point

509
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:55,190
then now is going to try to get another
another character

510
00:28:55,190 --> 00:28:58,850
we won't necessarily see who the winner
is now we're inside the next block and

511
00:28:58,850 --> 00:29:02,429
a bite here there will join a difference
in the cipher text so we do these days a

512
00:29:02,429 --> 00:29:04,139
week just keep the window

513
00:29:04,139 --> 00:29:07,429
that we're using all time keeping a
guess window that I guess when there's

514
00:29:07,429 --> 00:29:11,009
always me constantin that help
stabilizers font-size: is to always stay

515
00:29:11,009 --> 00:29:12,179
the same size

516
00:29:12,179 --> 00:29:15,539
specially the inputs to the I to
decipher

517
00:29:15,539 --> 00:29:18,580
so if we're always keeping as a 10
characters

518
00:29:18,580 --> 00:29:22,908
as with guest another character well at
a and will drop the first for keeping

519
00:29:22,909 --> 00:29:25,649
always tan and I'll keep us a line to
the tipping point

520
00:29:25,649 --> 00:29:29,129
key for all happy all be able to
overcome block cipher

521
00:29:29,129 --> 00:29:32,700
and a breach

522
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:36,200
the amoral blackston soul

523
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:39,639
we mentioned before they want stable
pages and the reason want a stable pages

524
00:29:39,639 --> 00:29:41,480
because if they're on stable

525
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:45,850
then Oracle is suffering from the
measurements it does not see a clear

526
00:29:45,850 --> 00:29:47,539
measurement indication I love

527
00:29:47,539 --> 00:29:52,158
its changing because it's a winner and
brother this is just gonna change

528
00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:52,669
because

529
00:29:52,669 --> 00:29:56,480
its unstable page no response at some
different data and the data changes

530
00:29:56,480 --> 00:30:01,480
and as a changes the size changes so we
want to change is to be St was possible

531
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:05,419
but if they're not that's not in the
world

532
00:30:05,419 --> 00:30:09,230
all we have to do is less Astaro a
couple requests 10-15

533
00:30:09,230 --> 00:30:12,539
doesn't matter and get our statistics
aligned so that

534
00:30:12,539 --> 00:30:16,499
after we do enough of those we can
average it out and then we compare

535
00:30:16,499 --> 00:30:20,830
that average to the average for the next
gas any fun average

536
00:30:20,830 --> 00:30:24,009
one is bigger than the other we know
that the one is smaller

537
00:30:24,009 --> 00:30:29,539
Oracle should should suggest that that's
the correct character

538
00:30:29,539 --> 00:30:34,169
Huffman coding we talked about it before
but the horn a dollar theater

539
00:30:34,169 --> 00:30:37,279
so one more thing we do is we
normalization so before we start I guess

540
00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:37,940
is

541
00:30:37,940 --> 00:30:44,090
weekend try to detect what is really the
Hoffman tree looking like lets try to

542
00:30:44,090 --> 00:30:46,999
figure out the half entry let's try to
figure out what's the frequencies which

543
00:30:46,999 --> 00:30:47,679
characters

544
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:51,960
what is being represented and longer
streams on one is being our presenters

545
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:55,610
shorter streams and the ones that we see
that are presented in short a strange

546
00:30:55,610 --> 00:30:59,049
we want to try and work around that and
basically balance it out with adding

547
00:30:59,049 --> 00:30:59,539
some

548
00:30:59,539 --> 00:31:03,080
virtual Valletta to essentially get
Oracle to

549
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:07,779
ignore that and just look at the real LZ
77 without their facts I love

550
00:31:07,779 --> 00:31:11,649
the Huffman coding

551
00:31:11,649 --> 00:31:15,450
now because we love our local so much we
are more than a few more however will be

552
00:31:15,450 --> 00:31:17,259
able to release them today because where

553
00:31:17,259 --> 00:31:22,509
pattern on them this getting Justin we
don't like this

554
00:31:22,509 --> 00:31:25,999
call our you still hear me just

555
00:31:25,999 --> 00:31:29,499
thanks thank you all on

556
00:31:29,499 --> 00:31:33,039
thank you so now home all of this can be

557
00:31:33,039 --> 00:31:37,139
I have seen some faces in the audience
to deny has think that's it

558
00:31:37,139 --> 00:31:40,580
nothing is given with me I'll send you
money over long

559
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:45,399
but do not have an edge it's not as hard

560
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:49,040
as hard as alleged by you know a

561
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:53,830
connecting cable in my hand is a little
harder a but tonight the skill here

562
00:31:53,830 --> 00:32:00,080
eyes Sarah when you should question is:
are you ready for that

563
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:03,500
there I'm not cannot

564
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:06,570
are you guys ready for them off there

565
00:32:06,570 --> 00:32:09,689
sound I

566
00:32:09,690 --> 00:32:13,120
them a time that's right them on time
yes

567
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:17,019
the STFU message sign so

568
00:32:17,019 --> 00:32:21,139
first remission them off now you tell
you how it works

569
00:32:21,139 --> 00:32:24,240
so we chose a the

570
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:28,190
application due into reality is there is
%uh you know there's a lot of occasions

571
00:32:28,190 --> 00:32:29,570
that are vulnerable

572
00:32:29,570 --> 00:32:33,759
I we install they I so hosted version
have

573
00:32:33,759 --> 00:32:37,690
popular in a plan to me like scissor
outlook web access

574
00:32:37,690 --> 00:32:41,159
and now weeks stalinism and we control

575
00:32:41,159 --> 00:32:44,159
as de Malmanche and %uh

576
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:47,480
it's basically just I'll ok well I says
on

577
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:50,710
nothing too fancy about it but %uh you
know keep an eye on that issue you know

578
00:32:50,710 --> 00:32:51,360
like this

579
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:54,629
let me get this model T a hundred
percent I

580
00:32:54,629 --> 00:32:58,769
so nasty I this to my heart and we gonna
do this

581
00:32:58,769 --> 00:33:03,379
no lunch preach reaches up and running
and then we need

582
00:33:03,379 --> 00:33:06,490
basically we aren t have the dating we
gonna

583
00:33:06,490 --> 00:33:10,019
in Jackson iframe in the victim and the
victim's not see anything wonder

584
00:33:10,019 --> 00:33:13,320
going to CNN dot com and the breach if I
could happen

585
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:17,139
i jus wanna show TI's OMAP 4 screen have
nots

586
00:33:17,139 --> 00:33:22,090
if that's okay when keep wanna the point
out that way

587
00:33:22,090 --> 00:33:25,230
like a yeah thank you okay so

588
00:33:25,230 --> 00:33:29,090
2002 luscious the main hand so we
thought you know

589
00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:32,100
you know how was a nice to me so

590
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:35,799
I we actually by the blanks had the
whole

591
00:33:35,799 --> 00:33:39,990
budget for the black talk but I you know
we actually on the may now sell

592
00:33:39,990 --> 00:33:44,159
I E is going to you know how to combine
then you can breach

593
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:48,110
so without further adieu I'll let's pray
that this works

594
00:33:48,110 --> 00:33:55,110
the

595
00:34:19,010 --> 00:34:26,010
movies

596
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:35,129
change

597
00:34:35,129 --> 00:34:36,598
good

598
00:34:36,599 --> 00:34:39,559
average

599
00:34:39,559 --> 00:34:40,929
we were nice

600
00:34:40,929 --> 00:34:45,220
there

601
00:34:45,220 --> 00:34:48,849
good enough but %uh now how long do you
think that here

602
00:34:48,849 --> 00:34:52,780
missile there was less than 60 seconds
maybe a little more than 30

603
00:34:52,780 --> 00:34:56,510
now what happened there as we extracted
a secret

604
00:34:56,510 --> 00:35:00,119
on the Ohio one side we extract is he
got from

605
00:35:00,119 --> 00:35:03,619
the mob outside you might think and what
is the secret let me show you as i can

606
00:35:03,619 --> 00:35:05,410
assume I G a local access

607
00:35:05,410 --> 00:35:09,759
and I just everybody can see that let me
refresh the page

608
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:13,730
and if this works you see something
interesting just watch 0

609
00:35:13,730 --> 00:35:16,869
now the pages and Russian now that is a
breach

610
00:35:16,869 --> 00:35:20,349
on buy you anything and how did that
happen wall

611
00:35:20,349 --> 00:35:25,349
if we company pays the shocking to hear
swat to the source code

612
00:35:25,349 --> 00:35:28,400
on a page control fine

613
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:32,820
and I i as assessor's talking

614
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:35,920
which is stole this is our talk prepared

615
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:42,920
I he writes

616
00:35:46,170 --> 00:35:49,590
some if you're skeptical let me lesson
at this moment I'm

617
00:35:49,590 --> 00:35:53,200
I let's let's see I work so just a
moment on that

618
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:58,400
I'm identity verified get a grandma and
I can get the connection

619
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:02,200
you can actually see you now certificate
has invalidated

620
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:06,540
such an actual malice certificate when I
like tampering or doing improv ceiling

621
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:09,120
more or anything like that isn't perfect
perfectly valid

622
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:12,520
certificate now when we go to the
malicious website

623
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:16,780
less months the breach that I've one
more time so when we launched the

624
00:36:16,780 --> 00:36:20,050
preacher time you gonna see the
frustration and a request and

625
00:36:20,050 --> 00:36:23,990
and Yesenia talk to view you can see how
he's getting every time to one by one

626
00:36:23,990 --> 00:36:28,720
by having the bro sorry should've lasts
a little more time with the music this

627
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:29,200
time

628
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:32,560
I so we are going to the

629
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:35,830
contra life eyes and miss the interview

630
00:36:35,830 --> 00:36:41,310
and we now live with crumb so you can
see there's a lot of requests going down

631
00:36:41,310 --> 00:36:44,990
back and forth on the bottom of your
screen that he so mean to one of those

632
00:36:44,990 --> 00:36:49,070
and this will make you stop the tie for
second but I

633
00:36:49,070 --> 00:36:52,680
you can see theirself she herself
request this one is going to be a local

634
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:53,390
access

635
00:36:53,390 --> 00:36:57,529
or in this case our target application
you know where the guests because he is

636
00:36:57,530 --> 00:37:00,020
getting them before you can see here's
just a number five

637
00:37:00,020 --> 00:37:03,640
and then isn't a call i do the latter

638
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:07,220
whitten those cases aspen commuted from
computer I

639
00:37:07,220 --> 00:37:10,940
think all I the tolls hey the request is
13

640
00:37:10,940 --> 00:37:15,760
now with the call box we know that a
request was completed so whatever we saw

641
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:19,560
and response whatever size miss under
spas dusk respond to that request

642
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:22,970
so we measured and we should one place
for every one of them

643
00:37:22,970 --> 00:37:26,240
than in 43 seconds we have the horses
are talking

644
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:30,360
now with your posts witnesses are
talking to Ashley you know change your

645
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:34,100
science so that's that's pretty cool the
missing you all you haters are

646
00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:39,200
what happens after class oh yeah and and

there is a thousand

648
00:37:43,250 --> 00:37:47,330
120 question the status now something
more interesting is because we have the

649
00:37:47,330 --> 00:37:49,090
surf dog and we can do you

650
00:37:49,090 --> 00:37:55,220
my close there's let me log in again so
we can do to follow and

00:37:55,220 --> 00:38:00,980
we can also I see my butt off Matt a
local axes let me longing and

652
00:38:00,980 --> 00:38:06,140
the section I wanted to show you let me
see if I can put it back in English

653
00:38:06,140 --> 00:38:07,250
because I don't really

654
00:38:07,250 --> 00:38:11,240
now russians so that I was little I see
he forgot to change by

655
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:14,340
the the language bed on

656
00:38:14,340 --> 00:38:18,580
there's anybody delay

657
00:38:18,580 --> 00:38:23,180
had side spiny taking it as an
astonishing for concerts fan so

658
00:38:23,180 --> 00:38:26,839
I i cant IQ test the same here refresh

659
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:30,150
hi thats despite to redeem also has gone
to rules

660
00:38:30,150 --> 00:38:33,480
and you will see how this annual

661
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:36,770
a vast persisting cute and how you open
it up

662
00:38:36,770 --> 00:38:40,600
former every email their rights to
persistent thread

663
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:44,319
do you know how to knock on now is that
come as an all-white

664
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:51,320
a dozen

665
00:38:51,740 --> 00:38:55,000
again and I'm pressure just something
more because the mighty

666
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:58,670
you know if you're skeptical about this
the way this works there's

667
00:38:58,670 --> 00:39:02,390
now when you know it to you any page she
basically

668
00:39:02,390 --> 00:39:05,950
let me show you this week from me do
this again

669
00:39:05,950 --> 00:39:09,490
and marveled at matts right so

670
00:39:09,490 --> 00:39:12,550
let me refresh should be in English I
guess not

671
00:39:12,550 --> 00:39:16,190
I just is fixated for the session

672
00:39:16,190 --> 00:39:19,990
listed as more time I one

673
00:39:19,990 --> 00:39:23,630
so one we've been effectively as we go
into this new page

674
00:39:23,630 --> 00:39:28,870
by running your email and we find out
let's discredit our industry your hair

675
00:39:28,870 --> 00:39:31,029
or so how do we treat an error in and
I'm

676
00:39:31,030 --> 00:39:34,530
Microsoft products bombs time in a
random numbers I

677
00:39:34,530 --> 00:39:37,680
said you know so you so we have some
sense into numbers

678
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:41,129
and out you know and then again this
forcing many many many

679
00:39:41,130 --> 00:39:45,780
a somewhere other went on to run the
numbers let's find some numbers actually

680
00:39:45,780 --> 00:39:46,720
make sounds like

681
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:51,040
hollow blood rights and when you can see
is

682
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:54,120
human source told the search for hello
glad

683
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:58,029
you can absolutely see that is getting
rough like that under response

684
00:39:58,030 --> 00:40:01,510
now twice I think and is that lol I have
less to carry

685
00:40:01,510 --> 00:40:06,340
equals Colo blood analyst with the
source code woman time

686
00:40:06,340 --> 00:40:09,950
right so you can see now

687
00:40:09,950 --> 00:40:14,020
I think given people the violence in it
says Carrie

688
00:40:14,020 --> 00:40:17,630
people's lol I had now the interesting
thing as much cannery

689
00:40:17,630 --> 00:40:22,160
see it's also India lot of hammer so

690
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:25,960
which is the star rotating through every
hanks' character

691
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:30,520
start:0 and we are one two three and two
we had the one that is cracked base and

692
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:33,720
a small as compression size so we just
do the street is you're all

693
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:37,570
and then report back to the server in
the server knows when to move forward

694
00:40:37,570 --> 00:40:40,810
and get the whole talking money just
talkin that it will issue demolish

695
00:40:40,810 --> 00:40:41,590
request

696
00:40:41,590 --> 00:40:45,650
the world said the language and Russian
it will forward the email

697
00:40:45,650 --> 00:40:49,640
ideally will set up the language like
English but up that was just to show you

698
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:50,560
guys so

699
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:53,880
I'm now you may be thinking kind it is
against my own applications in the

700
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:55,000
answer is yes

701
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:59,740
I making dipping here I'm gonna release
a self-assessment tool

702
00:40:59,740 --> 00:41:04,190
I Nash uses one thing for you guys this
tool is a strictly for educational

703
00:41:04,190 --> 00:41:05,360
purposes

704
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:07,340
a

705
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:13,270
our solicitor Flacco even when they're
find out this is Sasha this is an

706
00:41:13,270 --> 00:41:14,480
occasional purposes only

707
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:17,430
I've known a tool which we're going to
list this week is gonna do is going to

708
00:41:17,430 --> 00:41:21,040
allow you to pointed to appeal see page
that we provide and then you can just go

709
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:23,009
ahead and test breach you have a
baseline

710
00:41:23,010 --> 00:41:26,770
you can adjust the prime interest like
we did with a low capacity testing it on

711
00:41:26,770 --> 00:41:30,090
our issue testing as your Internet
history is your company this officers

712
00:41:30,090 --> 00:41:31,690
may use a few model to breach

713
00:41:31,690 --> 00:41:36,180
if you are the bad news is that you have
a problem

714
00:41:36,180 --> 00:41:39,879
the good news is that we may have a
solution for you I and

715
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:46,880
doctor harris is going to call you my
solutions on

716
00:41:47,010 --> 00:41:51,240
okay so I'm how many areas so I'm sure
that probably ninety percent more you're

717
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:51,870
thinking

718
00:41:51,870 --> 00:41:55,650
what you should do is well just hide the
length the thing right at a random

719
00:41:55,650 --> 00:41:56,880
comment at the end

720
00:41:56,880 --> 00:42:00,430
for the beginning in your page and %uh
just try to scare the link that way

721
00:42:00,430 --> 00:42:05,270
arm doesn't really work and the reason
for that is your still leaking

722
00:42:05,270 --> 00:42:06,130
information

723
00:42:06,130 --> 00:42:09,990
right you're forcing the attacker to
make more requests measure more sponsors

724
00:42:09,990 --> 00:42:14,300
but the bias will still be there to the
track gas on average the truck gas will

725
00:42:14,300 --> 00:42:15,030
yield

726
00:42:15,030 --> 00:42:20,190
the smaller response so it's a small
tourney attacker Sivananda lead is not

727
00:42:20,190 --> 00:42:23,860
actually close the site shall South

728
00:42:23,860 --> 00:42:27,950
well as why you do well instead of
having a seizure be the same for a

729
00:42:27,950 --> 00:42:28,890
response

730
00:42:28,890 --> 00:42:32,150
depending on the contacts and then what
the secrets actually four you might be

731
00:42:32,150 --> 00:42:34,590
able to have the secret change every
single time

732
00:42:34,590 --> 00:42:38,130
I'm disease us cuz we rely on the secret
actually being

733
00:42:38,130 --> 00:42:42,080
the same across you know the thousand or
so upper-class

734
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:45,990
maybe for some reason though

735
00:42:45,990 --> 00:42:49,820
whatever the secret is a time for tax
you can't have a change

736
00:42:49,820 --> 00:42:54,700
her response so instead where you might
be able to do is have a beer and a mask

737
00:42:54,700 --> 00:42:55,750
which is generated

738
00:42:55,750 --> 00:42:59,550
for his response and use that to you
essentially just sacks are out against

739
00:42:59,550 --> 00:43:02,120
the secret for the mask right next to
the secret

740
00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:05,759
the axe or secret and then send that
down the climb arm

741
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:09,040
the reason this disease us is because
while the secrets actually itself the

742
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:09,550
same

743
00:43:09,550 --> 00:43:13,770
is being presented a page in a different
way every time which means that we can't

744
00:43:13,770 --> 00:43:14,970
sell we can proceed

745
00:43:14,970 --> 00:43:21,660
okay how much another medications such a
race secrets from any user input

746
00:43:21,660 --> 00:43:25,420
so instead of having the the attacker
controlled a load out there across

747
00:43:25,420 --> 00:43:26,230
browner

748
00:43:26,230 --> 00:43:29,730
be in the same compression context as
the target secret have them come in

749
00:43:29,730 --> 00:43:30,840
several responses

750
00:43:30,840 --> 00:43:34,530
I'm solo

751
00:43:34,530 --> 00:43:38,100
with one thing that we actually reliance
was attacked workers we are forging your

752
00:43:38,100 --> 00:43:38,760
class

753
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:43,200
I'm house for the rectum so you might be
able to mediate this five

754
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:47,090
Cesar protecting a volatile pagers it's
a little weird on the target secret to

755
00:43:47,090 --> 00:43:50,200
Caesar Tokunbo the now caesar salads are
the only possible

756
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:53,830
targets here now a solo

757
00:43:53,830 --> 00:43:57,480
we don't have to make a huge number
class like a hundred other something

758
00:43:57,480 --> 00:43:58,490
though we are making

759
00:43:58,490 --> 00:44:02,010
you know release a thousand or so
requests a thing as a web application

760
00:44:02,010 --> 00:44:06,940
in about a minute that is faster than
any human use a web app so

761
00:44:06,940 --> 00:44:11,290
one potential mitigation is to trial
users and monitor the summer traffic

762
00:44:11,290 --> 00:44:15,070
an income I never saw the other
medications dimensions and finally

763
00:44:15,070 --> 00:44:18,270
the only one that really works on a
verse on the time is just turn off

764
00:44:18,270 --> 00:44:19,850
impression on responses

765
00:44:19,850 --> 00:44:23,250
army my now some other problems you do
that but I will I guarantee you

766
00:44:23,250 --> 00:44:23,920
completely

767
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:30,920
defeat this attack to make your User
Experience team very happy as well

768
00:44:32,030 --> 00:44:35,070
on so was lol future work

769
00:44:35,070 --> 00:44:38,890
sold the first thing that we we had so
many roadblocks that we had and we were

770
00:44:38,890 --> 00:44:42,470
trying to do a lot of things together
are percentages of success higher higher

771
00:44:42,470 --> 00:44:45,310
and we ended up getting at 95 percent
success rate so

772
00:44:45,310 --> 00:44:49,420
at least the peso we test that I was a
different pages will differ depending on

773
00:44:49,420 --> 00:44:50,770
a lot of those conditions we had

774
00:44:50,770 --> 00:44:54,660
but damn I now be perfectly my want to
get 100 percent

775
00:44:54,660 --> 00:44:58,580
so future work to would be to really
analyze a little better

776
00:44:58,580 --> 00:45:02,759
zip deflate understand a little better
those two components Huffman coding as a

777
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:03,570
77

778
00:45:03,570 --> 00:45:06,980
and understand how can we really
maximize and get our

779
00:45:06,980 --> 00:45:10,810
solution perfect the second thing I am

780
00:45:10,810 --> 00:45:14,730
this this attack breaches really nothing
to do with https

781
00:45:14,730 --> 00:45:18,790
so it begs the question what else what
else can we preach what other protocols

782
00:45:18,790 --> 00:45:21,720
what other systems love encryption
systems use compression underneath the

783
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:22,100
hood

784
00:45:22,100 --> 00:45:25,760
now we can try to attack we are

785
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:31,220
stay tuned for the next breach weeeeee
we r we intend to be back

786
00:45:31,220 --> 00:45:35,140
we have actually another high breach
we're now ready to disclose our won t

787
00:45:35,140 --> 00:45:39,180
let the companies are do their thing
first but I'll be back

788
00:45:39,180 --> 00:45:43,440
that's right if you want more we have
agents standing by

789
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:47,590
and locations worldwide I to answer your
questions

790
00:45:47,590 --> 00:45:51,190
the changes going to retire Kong I clean
our

791
00:45:51,190 --> 00:45:55,050
head it will have the PLC toll money and
the week

792
00:45:55,050 --> 00:45:59,740
it does have already the paper wakes up
me how to explain which much more death

793
00:45:59,740 --> 00:46:03,990
the whole talk if you're Korea's mile or
more go to read it I dot com

794
00:46:03,990 --> 00:46:08,020
and also and has this presentation that
you're seeing here so

795
00:46:08,020 --> 00:46:12,300
definitely go take it out so we're not
we would like to thank everybody for me

796
00:46:12,300 --> 00:46:13,350
here today

797
00:46:13,350 --> 00:46:20,350
yes awesome thank you

798
00:46:26,369 --> 00:46:30,199
and of course we will open the floor for
questions so I

799
00:46:30,199 --> 00:46:35,069
can you ask his new movie here and
please use can you buy just the way I do

800
00:46:35,069 --> 00:46:36,339
she live our talk

801
00:46:36,339 --> 00:46:39,670
so we can come up with more reach

802
00:46:39,670 --> 00:46:46,670
how we doing much yes question

803
00:46:54,420 --> 00:46:57,510
as a possible mediation in our plan ira
glasser

804
00:46:57,510 --> 00:47:00,500
SciTech really has nothing to with their
faces just in this ass if the case we

805
00:47:00,500 --> 00:47:03,130
found gazed I reflect a seagrams in the
air

806
00:47:03,130 --> 00:47:06,420
page we just need a pesar reflects the
user gas and a see CREF

807
00:47:06,420 --> 00:47:13,420
and this is what their face doesn't need
to be the

808
00:47:14,820 --> 00:47:18,780
price or so any real web app will
probably have a lot of places where we

809
00:47:18,780 --> 00:47:19,270
act like

810
00:47:19,270 --> 00:47:22,580
UK for a similar response to rising yeah
by yes

811
00:47:22,580 --> 00:47:26,370
that's your question you yeah

812
00:47:26,370 --> 00:47:29,759
the

813
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:36,760
community Daniel dampen the question you

814
00:47:41,470 --> 00:47:42,849
this

815
00:47:42,849 --> 00:47:45,940
so it really depends on where you're
thinking about how you're going and not

816
00:47:45,940 --> 00:47:48,109
sure that's all we have one limitation
was

817
00:47:48,109 --> 00:47:52,080
if your secret is with a metallic that
form with the clothes around there

818
00:47:52,080 --> 00:47:56,140
and you're not gonna laugh the reflected
user and put onto the bed without

819
00:47:56,140 --> 00:47:56,910
including

820
00:47:56,910 --> 00:48:01,460
then that would be the yes but in this
case in this specific case we had a lot

821
00:48:01,460 --> 00:48:03,940
of playing in a lot of link to the URL

822
00:48:03,940 --> 00:48:08,450
with a reflective drummers without if
anything was so you need to call in this

823
00:48:08,450 --> 00:48:08,890
case

824
00:48:08,890 --> 00:48:12,930
because they're see here and was now
away from our

825
00:48:12,930 --> 00:48:17,770
primary driver whose arm was canary cool
site and we gonna meet for an actress

826
00:48:17,770 --> 00:48:22,119
yeah months not a question girls

827
00:48:22,119 --> 00:48:24,600
okay

828
00:48:24,600 --> 00:48:27,630
I glass

829
00:48:27,630 --> 00:48:31,120
try and call it suggests we experimented
with I

830
00:48:31,120 --> 00:48:35,259
it was not as reliable as the 1i but I
Natalie can optimize and as you know

831
00:48:35,260 --> 00:48:37,170
where forty seconds we can fall in
demand

832
00:48:37,170 --> 00:48:40,170
we actually we actually want to the
trial our thinking about some

833
00:48:40,170 --> 00:48:42,950
really interesting ways that have AC
power that is that then you can always

834
00:48:42,950 --> 00:48:46,510
in response to you know which guess is
yes %uh switchers Alonso the rich gas

835
00:48:46,510 --> 00:48:50,720
migration trends as possible yes we have
an ETA try to do the coming multiplexing

836
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:52,849
so you can call it costs said

837
00:48:52,849 --> 00:48:54,940
gruza channels on every channel

838
00:48:54,940 --> 00:48:58,680
a possible two hundred by 87 even try to
do in parallel

839
00:48:58,680 --> 00:49:04,129
this

840
00:49:04,130 --> 00:49:06,049
here

841
00:49:06,049 --> 00:49:09,190
right

842
00:49:09,190 --> 00:49:12,270
yeah trivia alright next question

843
00:49:12,270 --> 00:49:16,570
you out when I come out here now just

844
00:49:16,570 --> 00:49:22,099
their leaders time had

845
00:49:22,099 --> 00:49:25,859
now the attacker does not abandon 120
every kid I was just to show that it was

846
00:49:25,859 --> 00:49:28,339
for flee a cell with you not happy with
the channel myself

847
00:49:28,339 --> 00:49:32,139
my questions descend on Las everyone
hears that

848
00:49:32,139 --> 00:49:36,660
addition to reject request again

849
00:49:36,660 --> 00:49:39,750
friend writers racism nullification

850
00:49:39,750 --> 00:49:44,740
reject requests how secret you have in
mind yeah

851
00:49:44,740 --> 00:49:47,530
so are you saying

852
00:49:47,530 --> 00:49:51,040
you're gonna shine figure I'm guessing
the sea friends from his way

853
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:54,220
well I guess you have to build an
intelligence application to

854
00:49:54,220 --> 00:49:57,760
know when we're trying to just to see
her in and throws away thank you

855
00:49:57,760 --> 00:49:59,070
complicating the unlikely

856
00:49:59,070 --> 00:50:02,820
caesar salads are having a sexy thing to
a tax break but we could offer other

857
00:50:02,820 --> 00:50:03,460
stuff too

858
00:50:03,460 --> 00:50:06,820
so you have to somehow it is free every
single possible thing you wanna attacked

859
00:50:06,820 --> 00:50:07,230
in

860
00:50:07,230 --> 00:50:12,560
and then I security years

861
00:50:12,560 --> 00:50:17,290
life life correct but yeah it's pretty
hard to get outta my house just two

862
00:50:17,290 --> 00:50:19,850
numbers my house I'll find inside you
cannot always

863
00:50:19,850 --> 00:50:24,589
United you have a username United
secret's out yes yeah

864
00:50:24,590 --> 00:50:28,280
and will be here for a while later to
let him questions just so we can get

865
00:50:28,280 --> 00:50:29,280
more people out

866
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:34,470
question volunteers I can I its you

867
00:50:34,470 --> 00:50:37,600
separated gas with yes

868
00:50:37,600 --> 00:50:42,050
with house prime on poisoning

869
00:50:42,050 --> 00:50:45,540
her side your your régionale

870
00:50:45,540 --> 00:50:51,700
more the only 1i the phrase we must
tremendous question-and-answer

871
00:50:51,700 --> 00:50:56,300
yeah I am basically we're trying to do
is try to balance out so he was asking

872
00:50:56,300 --> 00:50:59,380
is can we potentially try to inject a
bunch of characters with very high

873
00:50:59,380 --> 00:51:03,470
frequency than we know they're not a
secret to try to balance out the secrets

874
00:51:03,470 --> 00:51:05,070
of the seeker part about from there

875
00:51:05,070 --> 00:51:09,130
will be nice on the bottom of the half
countries without me the color call away

876
00:51:09,130 --> 00:51:12,670
and they won't confuse Oracle I think
it's a great idea now I think they did

877
00:51:12,670 --> 00:51:16,380
it wrong with a little bit I hold in the
bus show in SF yossi

878
00:51:16,380 --> 00:51:20,730
it's a great idea

879
00:51:20,730 --> 00:51:25,480
it stirs room for plan for concessions
we just did what we could to get a 95

880
00:51:25,480 --> 00:51:26,040
percent

881
00:51:26,040 --> 00:51:29,270
class reliability I'm a question is yes

882
00:51:29,270 --> 00:51:33,400
group norse early work the brown eyes
were

883
00:51:33,400 --> 00:51:37,110
your this through he's dating that her
ministry

884
00:51:37,110 --> 00:51:41,650
norse you that's a good question soles
of his ass he is coming creator

885
00:51:41,650 --> 00:51:43,830
deterministic noise to allow

886
00:51:43,830 --> 00:51:47,400
us to create a repeated pattern but
unknown pattern for the

887
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:50,510
for the best from attacker and busy and
not allow you to to

888
00:51:50,510 --> 00:51:53,310
guess the characters we actually had
someone does something very interesting

889
00:51:53,310 --> 00:51:55,799
very similar to that may be exactly that

890
00:51:55,800 --> 00:51:59,980
which was busy trying to age Mac with
the key the entire than tiring but not

891
00:51:59,980 --> 00:52:00,930
as the Browns entire

892
00:52:00,930 --> 00:52:05,030
response basically and therefore have
they basically a deterministic response

893
00:52:05,030 --> 00:52:07,380
to and then use a shock result into some

894
00:52:07,380 --> 00:52:11,530
entry has tabled all the time how much
length padding tried to confuse Oracle

895
00:52:11,530 --> 00:52:15,180
I we have easy way around our we think
we have his way around our

896
00:52:15,180 --> 00:52:19,350
is just let's just try to create a
thousand random strings

897
00:52:19,350 --> 00:52:22,980
and add that to every gas and then you
go back to averaging writer them

898
00:52:22,980 --> 00:52:24,390
basically every was on TSA

899
00:52:24,390 --> 00:52:28,609
as I those you average out on your back
to square 0 some online dynamic pages

900
00:52:28,610 --> 00:52:32,430
and I hope you have a chance possible
but makes a slower but not slower than

901
00:52:32,430 --> 00:52:38,500
thats and the wrong thing visible look
at my questions

902
00:52:38,500 --> 00:52:45,500
this C

903
00:52:45,520 --> 00:52:52,520
it

904
00:52:53,869 --> 00:52:54,820
left

905
00:52:54,820 --> 00:52:58,300
let me ask eyes are Dada the question
has

906
00:52:58,300 --> 00:53:02,480
you now session ID is our site and the
answer is for the most part

907
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:05,840
offenses are you know equally its

908
00:53:05,840 --> 00:53:08,260
how home because you can do anything to
do with a session because you have a

909
00:53:08,260 --> 00:53:09,180
sister docking

910
00:53:09,180 --> 00:53:13,900
order some financial institutions and
urs pages that have legacy frameworks

911
00:53:13,900 --> 00:53:16,950
nationally dead develops although they
have less

912
00:53:16,950 --> 00:53:20,490
frameworks that will register the
session ID onto body many cuz they said

913
00:53:20,490 --> 00:53:23,070
it will partner maybe could have an
iframe any cuz they

914
00:53:23,070 --> 00:53:26,130
they just do so. it's not unheard of to
see Josh s

915
00:53:26,130 --> 00:53:29,220
J session ID is a PHP is actually he's
on the body

916
00:53:29,220 --> 00:53:32,380
as I can practice as you point out but
if it's in the body we can get it

917
00:53:32,380 --> 00:53:38,390
but yes the request and the actual
response header Sonata up

918
00:53:38,390 --> 00:53:41,700
compressed just the I'm just the actual
money

919
00:53:41,700 --> 00:53:45,140
but let me ask let me add just one point
and I think I one place was very common

920
00:53:45,140 --> 00:53:46,920
this is an 80's action the response

921
00:53:46,920 --> 00:53:50,450
so you have the obligation a dozen other
wise put it in are you might see a lot

922
00:53:50,450 --> 00:53:52,210
in third-party integrations were you
have

923
00:53:52,210 --> 00:53:55,220
one domain trying to somehow connect
another domain anti the authentication

924
00:53:55,220 --> 00:53:55,840
between two

925
00:53:55,840 --> 00:54:02,840
you might see over there sessions a
response yet a las

926
00:54:03,990 --> 00:54:06,400
author they could be very interesting
especially if you're kind like auto

927
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:09,210
insurance auto lot they are sending the
key to them something you're

928
00:54:09,210 --> 00:54:13,810
yeah I've we got a couple more minutes
for questions so

929
00:54:13,810 --> 00:54:17,290
if anyone has questions I was will just
go down and talk to you guys any

930
00:54:17,290 --> 00:54:20,460
any more questions anyone like to ask
yes

931
00:54:20,460 --> 00:54:24,290
here love now

932
00:54:24,290 --> 00:54:30,779
yes

933
00:54:30,780 --> 00:54:35,130
I we have not so the question has as a
way to see the entire

934
00:54:35,130 --> 00:54:39,600
without debating going to talk to Paige
I you know we we are experimenting with

935
00:54:39,600 --> 00:54:43,500
that case we will you have time but I I
have this your even I

936
00:54:43,500 --> 00:54:46,880
going to try to prove the next few weeks
I have a theory that an email client

937
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:51,830
album is acceptable to the stock's
namely I miss ways to make up a large

938
00:54:51,830 --> 00:54:54,900
rendering to semantically but more
importantly I

939
00:54:54,900 --> 00:54:58,860
Safari male renders images automatically
by the Falls High

940
00:54:58,860 --> 00:55:02,530
so if you came issue they're watching us
to get hurt

941
00:55:02,530 --> 00:55:06,470
coming across an hour the attacker
basically with iraq's back to the target

942
00:55:06,470 --> 00:55:08,110
site with a 302 redirect

943
00:55:08,110 --> 00:55:11,550
and I you measure trafficking and you go
into an accident as sole I have

944
00:55:11,550 --> 00:55:13,930
synchronous it into something we have
when the %ah

945
00:55:13,930 --> 00:55:17,350
with ice cream but I think if you have
synchronicity which means only one

946
00:55:17,350 --> 00:55:20,450
request at a time so we can actually
measure nah man of getting them

947
00:55:20,450 --> 00:55:23,660
you know hold garth garbage and make
stop

948
00:55:23,660 --> 00:55:28,120
I'm I think it's possible to mail
clients house which will be pretty cool

949
00:55:28,120 --> 00:55:31,410
I we just saw honestly haven't done it
yet but i i think it's there's nothing

950
00:55:31,410 --> 00:55:32,149
technically

951
00:55:32,150 --> 00:55:36,850
that would stop that have all

952
00:55:36,850 --> 00:55:41,560
the obvious or a sleek right to use and
you have like two thousand images

953
00:55:41,560 --> 00:55:42,580
preloaded and a

954
00:55:42,580 --> 00:55:46,440
in the mail and and one after another
start loading and you coordinated with

955
00:55:46,440 --> 00:55:47,090
iraq's

956
00:55:47,090 --> 00:55:50,640
I okay so

957
00:55:50,640 --> 00:55:54,319
yeah yet so there's no more you consider

958
00:55:54,320 --> 00:55:58,460
questions well I will be here and yes I
have class so thank you again

959
00:55:58,460 --> 00:56:04,500
