1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:04,210
I good evening everybody let's look at
both in five years he received with me

2
00:00:04,210 --> 00:00:08,349
we r ball from the University of Trento
which is in the Northeast Philly any

3
00:00:08,349 --> 00:00:11,639
right in the middle of the Alps on their
way to a lot of

4
00:00:11,639 --> 00:00:17,000
research on me as I with a new CNN these
research with the UC's where he's at

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,210
were you send me and we're gonna talk
about how this USS is da same here

6
00:00:22,210 --> 00:00:23,289
fixing policy

7
00:00:23,289 --> 00:00:27,970
and I agree with your money by making
you didn't do much more work do you

8
00:00:27,970 --> 00:00:29,179
actually should be

9
00:00:29,179 --> 00:00:33,550
and as a side note after our talk on how
why even if he stays sites

10
00:00:33,550 --> 00:00:37,328
nothing better at a and I there talk on
whenever he decides

11
00:00:37,329 --> 00:00:42,300
sheesh so I just present ourselves
racially and I we work in this security

12
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:44,260
over many universities to enjoy

13
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:49,120
we coordinate a MARTA station on the
road European projects and

14
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:54,230
these I play a role in from cyber
security is security enforcement

15
00:00:54,230 --> 00:00:57,829
by a particular when I want whenever I
hear is that we where he need a lot of

16
00:00:57,829 --> 00:01:01,500
the issue we asked by miss lacy mandated
saeb

17
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:06,900
UK US National grayish so our we went to
Los often these guys if you want to see

18
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,140
more need us on

19
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:12,750
what we wait on and obviously Harmeet
lead me are

20
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:18,540
we can discuss anything anytime you want
to before signing on as mole least

21
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:20,159
leaners representation

22
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:23,220
trouble only yeah only in America and
all

23
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:26,479
many all examples to clarify some

24
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:30,920
diary she knows some Asian knowledge is
that we used in particular maybe to pass

25
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:34,549
this US escort for example as a leader
is

26
00:01:34,549 --> 00:01:37,890
and in a moment sonya is the only
daughter is Satish

27
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:41,740
every time you see him he wearing a
white coat down there in the bottom

28
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:42,710
right corner

29
00:01:42,710 --> 00:01:47,009
in the Zune on the seizure and saber si
no more many

30
00:01:47,009 --> 00:01:52,579
say she isolation you sue somebody that
see you want

31
00:01:52,579 --> 00:01:57,049
isolates are asking well in their
abilities to you we already sold from

32
00:01:57,049 --> 00:01:57,520
the

33
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:01,289
told before applying to be a question
and the question we are proposing today

34
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:02,030
is

35
00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:05,170
should we worry any you know the thing
you will not immediately affect their

36
00:02:05,170 --> 00:02:06,240
software

37
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:12,000
how much concerned about cred 3z
security for your assets should you be

38
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,390
now I G lancer and actually what he/she

39
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:20,340
what you should do you should you do and
indeed real answer to the session is

40
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:25,620
of course you must were a any settlement
immediate disaster and it is a potential

41
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:28,010
way to get into your classes

42
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:31,230
getting taller than that of course after
6h

43
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:35,690
but I see you really showed and I asked
me already know of course is this

44
00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:40,530
menendez's just too many enable legacy
the only just started sure of that line

45
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:42,940
the luminal really is the nation's
supporting damage

46
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:47,329
he just saw her well-meaning doing it
for and receive aluminum unibody just

47
00:02:47,330 --> 00:02:48,209
not feasible

48
00:02:48,209 --> 00:02:51,650
so what you need is a Dr East major are
something that has you need these

49
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:54,330
amenities dangerous easy immediately

50
00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:59,040
is unanimity is less dangerously for
major now if you ask

51
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:03,620
for example the US dollar man's are many
other environments as well are you

52
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:04,430
follow

53
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:09,760
protocols and he gave me chest after all
or are you sat on their site any PCI DSS

54
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,230
from the credit cards

55
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:14,260
which is a new lease you gonna use this
USS

56
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:20,950
SC she twice seriously jewish now i seee
forum on CD recess

57
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:25,360
and ICOS it was designed to assess the
impact on the system

58
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:30,650
all the women I meet a he's not really
easy with occasional resist myself

59
00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:33,650
soul the scene that you have to cease

60
00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:40,569
every CEO hi CSS inability far as I can
see sure falling what's your government

61
00:03:40,569 --> 00:03:42,040
for example is telling you to do

62
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:45,329
the ease made me horny sash

63
00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:49,340
and you sure yes immediate action lead
rainy tool to side

64
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:56,340
so what is CSS at the end of the day
it's what's in america's mainly Kohls

65
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:01,840
clinical tests so you suppose you have a
problem with a high C haha sadly

66
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:05,830
when do you go to the emergency room in
the doctor will run with her simple

67
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:09,220
clinical tests with a look at the thing
you see one

68
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:13,340
look nothing on the left to see one or
two one or two

69
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:17,228
the ohmygawd all three direction are
impacted company shiny availability

70
00:04:17,228 --> 00:04:19,310
integrity are all impacted

71
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:22,330
so in this high him back when I really
do. your software

72
00:04:22,330 --> 00:04:26,800
news ass close 1i just uses still
doesn't close and I S

73
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:30,080
you see listed the home all your receipt
only two ice

74
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:34,609
gonna say oh my god is its easy to
exploit is not in all cases

75
00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:38,790
solo it's a high impact will now be
released this is really clinical

76
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:39,830
expertise

77
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:43,620
the snow around in Los strange to like
MRI scan

78
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:47,860
like penetration testing just legal
expertise is somebody looking at

79
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:48,500
something

80
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:51,509
now if the same thing will happen for
CBS s

81
00:04:51,509 --> 00:04:55,860
the new the CSS doctor that you ask for
will say oh this a high-impact

82
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:59,250
anywhere on the stock protocol and
doubts you always come problems to

83
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:00,360
YouTube patch

84
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:04,120
if the the doctor will be in no doubt
that he would tell you

85
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:08,000
liable for brain surgery because you
need to change your

86
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,949
IT infrastructure impaction will give
your brain surgery but now

87
00:05:11,949 --> 00:05:16,750
us as a human you will be very unwilling
to do this

88
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:20,780
to go for brain surgery just because an
expert told you that is this something

89
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:21,830
very high risk

90
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:25,210
so the question you like to know is how
risks

91
00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:30,289
can 25 this risk and some more tired
scientific workplace informing way

92
00:05:30,289 --> 00:05:34,330
so if you go back to this example of
double vision

93
00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:39,020
when you do this ass he found out that
for you people

94
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:42,979
recovered without treatment they just go
to the hospital in Commack

95
00:05:42,979 --> 00:05:46,030
doctors do this ass with statistics

96
00:05:46,030 --> 00:05:50,080
so sadistically let's say they saw that
this is the case

97
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:54,849
however you some other cases I mean
hillary Clinton has one example

98
00:05:54,850 --> 00:05:58,580
if you have no soul intracranial Asian

99
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:03,330
so something in the brain guess damage
you not gonna recall

100
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:07,630
Wiese without treatment now what's the
equivalent of these additional task you

101
00:06:07,630 --> 00:06:10,159
gonna run movies penetration testing

102
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:13,539
maybe's additional information like
press as an exploit pack

103
00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:17,818
or similar thanks so just what we need a
tax is not an ass

104
00:06:17,819 --> 00:06:21,160
and basically would you like to have is
what the question below it

105
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:25,180
corning's is an information officer will
act iraq okay now I have my Security

106
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:26,780
Configuration Manager at one

107
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:31,240
and SIM and buy one from each p.m. many
of them he does mean higher dose

108
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:34,630
high levels of the inability I found my
test flights

109
00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:38,020
nah I find it hard to decide if I want
to patch it or not

110
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:43,349
I want snow s this would increase my
risk by Sandra same page

111
00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:46,389
Anish if that's the case I'm a decided
the risk is worth

112
00:06:46,389 --> 00:06:50,509
not and sometimes they may decide okay a
nice the only thing that's left is that

113
00:06:50,509 --> 00:06:52,800
the security configuration and assess

114
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:57,490
pash maybe the risks will only increase
5

115
00:06:57,490 --> 00:07:02,699
a little things like 3 percent so maybe
it's not worth catching

116
00:07:02,699 --> 00:07:07,620
source ERP making an example for for
doctors say you said SAS

117
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:12,289
made you talking about serious the talk
about viruses or illnesses

118
00:07:12,289 --> 00:07:15,460
Hewitt morning difference in Ireland
docking in mott

119
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:18,840
attacks so is this

120
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:22,530
word anybody that doesn't make sense to
ask a question like

121
00:07:22,530 --> 00:07:28,210
risk decreased by tax per cent and local
with lol

122
00:07:28,210 --> 00:07:33,800
so ya PE security jail you can find out
below scenarios a enough for slammed

123
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:37,080
US the target secondary once you'll be
ones are

124
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:40,430
city as me some information you don pad
like

125
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:43,900
as the only a slight for example it
worse on your own particular

126
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:48,879
adams you're a shitty now in this case
up because you are under the Alien

127
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:53,509
you gonna do any set the six because
endi sucessful

128
00:07:53,509 --> 00:07:58,009
management or their system heart is not
as easy to 140 his nose at the six this

129
00:07:58,009 --> 00:07:58,750
is Jess

130
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:02,879
I'm bash so trying to answer here to
question this I just posted

131
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:07,530
net design and there's no memory he says
he does a religion a lovely Asian

132
00:08:07,530 --> 00:08:10,560
upon which to base I G policy

133
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:14,840
for me she said you see how much the
reissue for Miss blasian deliveries

134
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:18,449
with a particular shhh I in the IAEA's

135
00:08:18,449 --> 00:08:23,319
your maybe just one of the targets and
recently actually because the at ashleys

136
00:08:23,319 --> 00:08:26,500
scene also these morning aim at home
president Nina

137
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:30,110
quite a few regions you don't see me
softly cast many

138
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:33,779
a many other house now or just come to
mediate

139
00:08:33,779 --> 00:08:38,708
and I'll admit I S stocks are redirected
necessary toward unity just directed

140
00:08:38,709 --> 00:08:41,779
toward the completion of probation
little users

141
00:08:41,779 --> 00:08:45,970
an issue heading to me eat is the set of
targets

142
00:08:45,970 --> 00:08:49,320
and you're vulnerable nanny your
compromise

143
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:52,950
now let's hear me causing the reason the
lesion also all the

144
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:57,570
users we can easily see some damage and
he's exactly the eighties on which we

145
00:08:57,570 --> 00:08:59,640
these were really far this year not

146
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:04,850
focusing on next want that ass women
really focusing on the generous tax an

147
00:09:04,850 --> 00:09:05,330
area

148
00:09:05,330 --> 00:09:08,630
ish and you that s we collected

149
00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:12,260
for your innocence foresees Anne

150
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:17,080
wish and we can see here for the car was
in the sign a two-year so let me that is

151
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:21,450
and cheer for you you are so I only need

00:10:50,510 --> 00:10:53,550
commercially anybody is easy and their

176
00:10:53,550 --> 00:10:58,120
I however if you look at it how old is
the

177
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:02,840
the software he's issued a unanimous of
the CC meeting is not a said

178
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:06,000
you find a lot just south of course for
Windows for

179
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,830
Microsoft is for browsers and inflation
job I'm so on

180
00:11:10,830 --> 00:11:15,790
but he's also more s there sa for
several applications like

181
00:11:15,790 --> 00:11:21,910
Apache Rass any South Florida donate
remorse GTE and so on

182
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:26,750
actually slightly varied Anne Anne Anne
Anne Anne we think he is easily now

183
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:30,460
not SAT Jan pro-army and you will see I

184
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:34,610
leader in the presentation howie handle
these issue here

185
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:39,460
to get some PC she can handle it and
Indonesia forced us educate

age from the Easter season after a delay
markets

187
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:46,880
and is found in such case in particular
busy is

188
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:50,680
a substantial expansion on them that i
jus excited about the local

189
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:56,280
and we pretty lame easy money during
morning ninety frantic start

kits for for a certain amount of time
mom word and one year and a half in fact

191
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:07,790
so if we look at Holland easy to say 70
CUDA how later 81 the other

192
00:12:07,790 --> 00:12:11,160
he is a man Monday he's a man who did
all the

193
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:15,449
over the data sets now I R E S here are
proportional to the number limited

194
00:12:15,450 --> 00:12:17,420
immunities and you don't let the area

195
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:20,599
now hosting only on the area's be

196
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:25,080
scene is is any disease and to see if we
can see it in our study

197
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:29,030
on the top lead for you see who she is

198
00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:33,390
much much smaller than and Neda about 16
to lead in fact

199
00:12:33,390 --> 00:12:38,250
at the time simple each INEC me which he
isn't at all

200
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:41,630
center although on the stream a

201
00:12:41,630 --> 00:12:46,460
easy just follow these days more these
are about touching 1000 William yes

202
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:50,690
which may not mean much legal he is that
probably out of the easy

203
00:12:50,690 --> 00:12:55,840
you numerous CEO ladies not me you
really get exploited

204
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:59,950
manger scene late for me at least you
should only add value to their last levy

205
00:12:59,950 --> 00:13:00,970
on the left

206
00:13:00,970 --> 00:13:04,930
is on for any small fraction which he
said he's a proof-of-concept extradition

207
00:13:04,930 --> 00:13:05,970
bodies there

208
00:13:05,970 --> 00:13:10,420
the likelihood observation I K on the
actual distribution one

209
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:14,210
doesn't look too good I need me well any
and more den

210
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:19,310
agree just majority have seen me is not
contain DEET 9925 concert extradition

00:13:19,310 --> 00:13:21,630
cohen et a sec she's a DB

212
00:13:21,630 --> 00:13:26,980
soul in EU citing the proof is in the
presence of approve Constitution code is

213
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:27,410
not

214
00:13:27,410 --> 00:13:31,500
the TCEQ for actually speak issues
finally he

215
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:34,710
now is moles wherein the neural nets a
key piece

216
00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:39,370
next said it will mean it is in the
black markets you see a lot of the

217
00:13:39,370 --> 00:13:44,050
greatest majority of the service to see
me so lethal nearly $80,000 markets

218
00:13:44,050 --> 00:13:49,380
does it look like is going to be excited
so maybe it does make sense to market is

219
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:50,810
high and we see each

220
00:13:50,810 --> 00:13:56,990
and the museum is to assess as a moment
now if we focus is on the cars

221
00:13:56,990 --> 00:14:02,170
ion the we we call it is in a news
release saying today to reserve

deliveries assessment is made you wanna

278
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:31,200
see more product which is

279
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:35,340
a enough to let agree many times the
likelihood of the bed and

280
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:39,449
NH now if you can tell this year says
the slurry is

281
00:17:39,450 --> 00:17:42,810
I designed and used to assess the
stories what

282
00:17:42,810 --> 00:17:46,960
andy san dimas you to use not day came
from AJ and then

283
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:50,630
and I mean to me to just to the score an
easy is

284
00:17:50,630 --> 00:17:54,970
I mean a DC-nine nece but all these
aluminum unibody

285
00:17:54,970 --> 00:17:58,429
time soon enough after which is expected
to be liddy that

286
00:17:58,429 --> 00:18:02,250
ESA's issue using it as it is maiti
ghastly

287
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:06,330
did all the likelihood intimidation of
the race

288
00:18:06,330 --> 00:18:11,379
but if you see issue let colleague is
the Cutt did not assess the is

289
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:17,120
is good to me is for here in haiti is
reported aids goes from 0 to dance on

290
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:18,020
the line day

291
00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:22,470
x-axis and on the y-axis is the
frequency of that particular score for

292
00:18:22,470 --> 00:18:23,020
each

293
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:29,110
not the six UCAS he is not even if I
really just basically a constant

294
00:18:29,110 --> 00:18:33,550
so everything he saw at the mall which
means that everything as the scene

295
00:18:33,550 --> 00:18:34,418
release

296
00:18:34,419 --> 00:18:39,890
according to this USS Florida s a recent
meeting agenda says he's now

297
00:18:39,890 --> 00:18:43,179
as a little easy enough he's the only
area major

298
00:18:43,179 --> 00:18:46,610
cecile SS is not is Demetrius because it
matters

299
00:18:46,610 --> 00:18:53,610
everything as easily ABC not necessary
evil used by DJ Laz hustled me check

300
00:18:54,110 --> 00:18:57,700
now a if I myself was either jocelyn am
sure that

301
00:18:57,700 --> 00:19:01,720
most to the lie I actually think he is
now and we like

302
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:05,650
I am very angry no I don't agree with
guest we know numbers because

303
00:19:05,650 --> 00:19:09,510
and you you seen you only need not
assess

304
00:19:09,510 --> 00:19:12,660
without controlling for other factors
like

305
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:17,370
feel you just legal Mary post and
oranges right maybe any Gandhi's

306
00:19:17,370 --> 00:19:21,350
stuff already all the women abilities
that are not included

307
00:19:21,350 --> 00:19:24,630
penis demanding that a sad because
they're just too old and he's more

308
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:26,340
extras in like 30 ish

309
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:29,750
she doesn't mean that you are not
excited just means that at the moment of

310
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:31,130
the detection of my cash

311
00:19:31,130 --> 00:19:34,220
alva see mind that these were not
included

312
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:37,610
or maybe even the cytosol to a decrease

313
00:19:37,610 --> 00:19:40,669
that are a local nursery nurse for
Symantec

314
00:19:40,669 --> 00:19:45,780
soul seee sure meanie xilisoft ranges EU

315
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:50,030
on a monthly I'm deranged I'm also on a
on there are

316
00:19:50,030 --> 00:19:54,940
for example songs of the right to eating
disorder and 50 same ol

317
00:19:54,940 --> 00:20:00,440
but past South like each lake stations
stuff ain't easy being the only needy

318
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:04,860
source you can actually use that the
sticks like all knew he had demanded a

319
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:05,790
sure he'll

320
00:20:05,790 --> 00:20:09,830
she okay he is mad he is not enough to
D-day

321
00:20:09,830 --> 00:20:13,580
really journey from peach Sony something
more precise

322
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:17,649
and this is what side he's been to tell
you know

323
00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:23,790
so if you want to run something more
saint is a sad to see you left to live

324
00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:28,850
likely to a controlling the spank you
are some people today

325
00:20:28,850 --> 00:20:32,320
saw three not so well known to be a TV
with them in the wild

326
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:35,600
yes people to take a softer we don't do
that just put them in the wild but you

327
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,620
cannot ask somebody to say hey

328
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:42,040
taking the necessary version 6 run for
two years and have your bank account the

329
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:43,590
name did and

330
00:20:43,590 --> 00:20:47,280
maybe your identity is stolen you can
age still is

331
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:50,928
so you need something different Sudan
are running and running experiments and

332
00:20:50,929 --> 00:20:51,310
the

333
00:20:51,310 --> 00:20:54,620
unfortunately for ass baby already know
the Saints

334
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:58,960
because you cannot ask somebody just
small so you can test with his mocking

335
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:02,040
produce cancer so what do you do

336
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:05,190
you do what is called a case-control
study

337
00:21:05,190 --> 00:21:08,470
and especially at times sorta KCS

338
00:21:08,470 --> 00:21:14,010
case assembly persons waz Lancaster
which in our case we correspond to

339
00:21:14,010 --> 00:21:17,220
index sliding into me according Samantha
global

340
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:21,070
intelligence network and then who knows
what a buyer seller DJ

341
00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:25,220
all this case like the HRP buddy will do

342
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:31,070
a sack so she say it was so location
things that may explain the problem

343
00:21:31,070 --> 00:21:36,100
back in the regional Cassar casing was
thinking that location living in Long

344
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:39,980
what's because the pollution was the
case with black asses

345
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:44,060
I mean look at what is you already left
the smoking habits which in our case he

346
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:46,110
made a CVSS score

347
00:21:46,110 --> 00:21:51,310
and for each other cases UT randomly in
other persist

348
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:54,310
which is the same animal of the control
animals is

349
00:21:54,310 --> 00:22:00,030
white this call conjul study I take a
serious flooding into BDSM corresponding

350
00:22:00,030 --> 00:22:00,700
control

351
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:04,350
and then would you want to look at the
control to make his

352
00:22:04,350 --> 00:22:09,000
anymore donc really be comparison side
by side on one side

353
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:13,230
the and Lancaster am you look at the
same hospital patients

354
00:22:13,230 --> 00:22:16,919
so you can offset for some things that
you may not want major than you

355
00:22:16,919 --> 00:22:20,060
look for people with the same a dish the
same sacks and

356
00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:24,470
coming from the same location points and
then you look at extraordinary abilities

357
00:22:24,470 --> 00:22:25,620
this is the case you

358
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:29,000
and for each other and you don't do the
same kind

359
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:33,260
all men to be peace and they would be to
your control

360
00:22:33,260 --> 00:22:36,300
any lead to the same thing by
confidentiality integrity and

361
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:41,440
availability want to make sure that they
have the same impact

362
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:45,860
why because you want to make sure ur

363
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:49,960
past you don't confuse skin cancer
Lancaster it doesn't make sense to

364
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:51,560
compare don't have anything to hide

365
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:55,149
impacting confidentiality but maybe no
impact on integrity

366
00:22:55,150 --> 00:22:59,360
with will never be the only magazine a
great day

367
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:04,140
and then this is C or control system for
days you look back what is the CVSS for

368
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:05,800
all this control

369
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:10,490
uses someone who never really D&D it's
really not a basis only beats

370
00:23:10,490 --> 00:23:16,669
is messed points or reason this is not a
median the exploit kits

371
00:23:16,669 --> 00:23:21,310
so many many guys are doing something
with it so let's see

372
00:23:21,310 --> 00:23:24,700
in a sample so just to make it a bit
clearer

373
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:28,280
so we think he very simple no huge
issues us they're free

374
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:32,990
in Microsoft Internet Explorer so this
was disco report disclosing

375
00:23:32,990 --> 00:23:36,000
in 2010 yes a certain in my

376
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,010
for what confidentiality integrity and
availability

377
00:23:39,010 --> 00:23:42,750
evander and the softer are hard to find

378
00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:47,030
now what's the control we need to select
gramley want control

379
00:23:47,030 --> 00:23:50,360
& Mon 21 in HS for the next royal ass

380
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:54,260
wanna be's that has seen a teacher

381
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:57,710
in next week if you only find instances
randomly choose one

382
00:23:57,710 --> 00:24:01,070
and in the explained amazingly 7

383
00:24:01,070 --> 00:24:04,510
and everybody that 80s and some
political comment

384
00:24:04,510 --> 00:24:08,440
so we repeat this process for every
minute lead it's reported

385
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:12,659
in cement backtracked Explorer we find
one

386
00:24:12,659 --> 00:24:16,740
randomly in the corresponding data set

387
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:20,100
to our as a control and then for this
controller

388
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:23,610
BD we look back is its high scorer

389
00:24:23,610 --> 00:24:27,040
is lost horror is actually be

390
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:30,580
is fundamentally a team by any chance

391
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:34,100
so we can bash to same would be
something from same

392
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:38,060
and he said maybe something the same
characteristic he's always acting is

393
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:40,090
important in this offer is the same

394
00:24:40,090 --> 00:24:44,770
because we don't want to compare office
use of the word

395
00:24:44,770 --> 00:24:49,110
like the do I need to Joomla do
something that's like in any Internet

396
00:24:49,110 --> 00:24:50,110
Explorer

397
00:24:50,110 --> 00:24:53,169
social you ever done this when you look
for

398
00:24:53,169 --> 00:24:56,570
which is in many ways that makes
intercept company Weiss

399
00:24:56,570 --> 00:25:00,710
again in this case he also I believe is
the doctors are ATF and if I am just

400
00:25:00,710 --> 00:25:02,340
love that

401
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:06,260
one but mostly security researchers
focus on his sensitivity

402
00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:10,520
which but you don't know what his name
the message he would you want to know

403
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:14,190
wasn't I miss false-negative for posted

404
00:25:14,190 --> 00:25:18,790
so what do you look for is a true
positive versus the CCP

405
00:25:18,790 --> 00:25:23,230
so you want to make sure that your
metric is good in identifying the

406
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:27,440
will now be there are going to be
exploited the dangerous one

407
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:32,460
so since he is very high this means that
the pass correctly identify

408
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:36,360
exploited wanna is no listening is not
lacking

409
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:39,590
see people in ass so this means a lot of

410
00:25:39,590 --> 00:25:43,540
dangers Natalie D later on when the disc
orange

411
00:25:43,540 --> 00:25:48,840
in the when the wind is sorry mom is
going to be exploited in the wild

412
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:53,450
and this they will be dead you don't
want that

413
00:25:53,450 --> 00:25:58,389
however if you working in CI all this
assumption is also very important

414
00:25:58,389 --> 00:26:02,010
that is money you don't then I'm on that
biatch

415
00:26:02,010 --> 00:26:06,190
so you like to possibly to make sure
that you don't stand

416
00:26:06,190 --> 00:26:10,060
money for fixing something they don't
need fixing

417
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:14,149
Solis specificity come into play
specificity is a true nigger dicks

418
00:26:14,149 --> 00:26:17,879
this is all tell the people so this is
you never really did

419
00:26:17,879 --> 00:26:22,919
they're not going to explode into whites
ya Ali Sher somewhere

420
00:26:22,919 --> 00:26:27,980
maybe the the some all or sign foreign
government may use a spine you many

421
00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:29,800
miles you Spearfish

422
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:33,149
so they really didn't think he said he's
not gonna be fine

423
00:26:33,149 --> 00:26:37,950
when you try the information on the wide
it's really happening on the net

424
00:26:37,950 --> 00:26:41,179
effin science the services the side it's
not this means

425
00:26:41,179 --> 00:26:45,720
if you're not gonna be exploited past
will smart you correctly

426
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:49,320
if is slow it's there because it's
generates

427
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:53,629
lot of panic in the people because you
don't have TiVo you too

428
00:26:53,629 --> 00:26:57,030
you need brain surgery police call

429
00:26:57,030 --> 00:27:01,260
so a CVSS score once you have done this

430
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:05,480
it's not a sampling and then he uses as
a control study

431
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:11,169
so unfortunately its origin or a tank
tests

432
00:27:11,169 --> 00:27:16,110
soul in essence is AB de telas is stiff
you get a high CVSS score

433
00:27:16,110 --> 00:27:19,350
is a good market for explanation in the
wild

434
00:27:19,350 --> 00:27:22,790
assesses the sea tell us uses all CSS

435
00:27:22,790 --> 00:27:26,178
for a good market for not exploitation
because that's when you want to know

436
00:27:26,179 --> 00:27:28,649
what you would like to know if I get a
low I'm happy

437
00:27:28,649 --> 00:27:32,659
don't have to do anything you don't have
to worry efforts hi I would like to know

438
00:27:32,659 --> 00:27:37,080
okay asked Lori host there is an
explanation on just because somebody

439
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:41,428
bosnian pressure an implicit in the
first row in the table

440
00:27:41,429 --> 00:27:45,429
the first row in the table this day it's
a non-policy

441
00:27:45,429 --> 00:27:49,000
the policy that sass I know there's one
other media I don't even want to know

442
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:52,510
which is CVSS score a single match

443
00:27:52,510 --> 00:27:55,700
so it's complete list yet that and you
see there you get a very high

444
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:56,560
sensitivity

445
00:27:56,560 --> 00:28:00,460
because essentially you're passing
everything you're over protecting

446
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:02,230
yourself miss specificity

447
00:28:02,230 --> 00:28:06,480
is very no 0 percent now if you look at

448
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:11,419
wats s Joss CSS high and medium scores

449
00:28:11,419 --> 00:28:14,540
doing uses says it is still very high

450
00:28:14,540 --> 00:28:18,340
the specificity is not improving is only
belong to

451
00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:23,230
23 percent so when as in me so this is
always very difficult to perceive

452
00:28:23,230 --> 00:28:27,840
soul this may say if you passed for Mona
merely

453
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:32,030
three out of four where where mistake

454
00:28:32,030 --> 00:28:35,120
wear something they were not gonna be
exploited

455
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:38,520
was force on

456
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:42,850
this seem to draw in a four yr
proof-of-concept exploits

457
00:28:42,850 --> 00:28:47,659
in explode on a basis so this means yes
something on my test flights the senses

458
00:28:47,659 --> 00:28:51,350
the d-link redid the AP's again
ninety-seven percent

459
00:28:51,350 --> 00:28:56,369
as this is this is this election law so
this maze is not seek Amy

460
00:28:56,369 --> 00:28:59,440
a bit more in Montreal the former

461
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:02,580
its wrong for

462
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:06,750
and their deadline he said if you would
be a slight accent doing what the bad

463
00:29:06,750 --> 00:29:08,610
guys and marketing

464
00:29:08,610 --> 00:29:12,780
in the air for us so good exploited

465
00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:17,780
exploiting protest uses specificity in
grease is so this me said

466
00:29:17,780 --> 00:29:21,510
if this is always probably not gonna be
in the wilentz

467
00:29:21,510 --> 00:29:25,490
and city is also very high just to put
this into perspective to see all of our

468
00:29:25,490 --> 00:29:28,030
city do is urge is still two goals to

469
00:29:28,030 --> 00:29:32,260
comparing the medical profession that we
listened to all the most popular and

470
00:29:32,260 --> 00:29:33,399
well-known

471
00:29:33,399 --> 00:29:36,810
many tasks 1s the

472
00:29:36,810 --> 00:29:40,820
lot ass which is simple blacks and that
you ran for

473
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:44,810
pregnant women when they have over forty
when they have a child to employ that

474
00:29:44,810 --> 00:29:49,250
to check whether the embrace that the
child is a Down syndrome which issues

475
00:29:49,250 --> 00:29:50,490
mental handicap

476
00:29:50,490 --> 00:29:54,659
you see the specificity is 95 percent
this would you like is a CIO like to say

477
00:29:54,659 --> 00:29:55,200
okay

478
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:59,950
discourse s no I don't have to worry of
course you may still have

479
00:29:59,950 --> 00:30:03,010
as in the block past is wrong child's

480
00:30:03,010 --> 00:30:06,970
its or a handicapped child is is is it
unfortunately match

481
00:30:06,970 --> 00:30:10,090
but I'm also the case you can rely on it

482
00:30:10,090 --> 00:30:13,149
specificity sicilian status not so good

483
00:30:13,149 --> 00:30:16,220
penicillin good enough for you to like
most other things

484
00:30:16,220 --> 00:30:20,530
for me may be the last line is more
interesting that process cass is passing

485
00:30:20,530 --> 00:30:21,290
game is a

486
00:30:21,290 --> 00:30:25,928
flat ass is very simple Avanti most and
you see in this is this is this is in

487
00:30:25,929 --> 00:30:27,879
ninety percent

488
00:30:27,879 --> 00:30:32,000
so this means its readers ages 11 to go
a long way I mean

489
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:36,820
the CSS these is not good enough and we
are some good indicator light leaky some

490
00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:40,060
not sold in the queue my proof of
concept or

491
00:30:40,060 --> 00:30:43,240
things as that penetrator destin fine

492
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:47,879
but I love what really happens usually
black disinformation

493
00:30:47,879 --> 00:30:51,350
unit pageants km if the plant is numbers

494
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:55,940
in Bachynski men look I will tell you
about it

495
00:30:55,940 --> 00:31:00,590
top 10 Sunil fun now let's remember you
may see here Windies

496
00:31:00,590 --> 00:31:03,980
we assume it's amazing high any use for
vulnerabilities

497
00:31:03,980 --> 00:31:09,990
and no Susume the juror concealing cost
Heer with a number of aluminum it is now

498
00:31:09,990 --> 00:31:12,669
remembered as this issue 22 percent

499
00:31:12,669 --> 00:31:17,200
in Egypt for I love for one it is I'm
not going to mislead

500
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:22,929
Uden a Shoei to use any three times more
head for three times more money she

501
00:31:22,929 --> 00:31:24,210
three times more

502
00:31:24,210 --> 00:31:28,409
I time me you probably should but he is

503
00:31:28,409 --> 00:31:32,720
a you know he's comes from the
measurements of the text sneezes and I

504
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:33,470
your e

505
00:31:33,470 --> 00:31:37,379
up from the Louisiana your %eh
considered a sh

506
00:31:37,379 --> 00:31:43,040
I bonanza when you land the csce to an
isolation policy how what what evidence

507
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:48,520
when you'll you'll not allowed a strong
a word to me even their abilities

508
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:53,270
Alyssa Anderson numbers is what comes
out I remember you need to use course

509
00:31:53,270 --> 00:31:57,668
CZ has your our little natalie's you
should let the nation

510
00:31:57,669 --> 00:32:02,720
how many lady how many lands the high
and medium score and this is ninety

511
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:03,830
percent

512
00:32:03,830 --> 00:32:08,580
a one day not only all visit godaddy.com
to major in this is easy

513
00:32:08,580 --> 00:32:13,830
10:00 how many on those issues should
and ash you should not etched you need a

514
00:32:13,830 --> 00:32:15,300
shit anyway

515
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:19,669
because they were again shot high and
medium an easy easy easy for their see

516
00:32:19,669 --> 00:32:22,320
at the top of this I C 77 percent

517
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:26,250
as you come you did when the lady
twenty-some from the twice a day she

518
00:32:26,250 --> 00:32:29,080
would have avoided and its me CRM sauna

519
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:32,790
when he turns out our list and I'm
really easy you will

520
00:32:32,790 --> 00:32:36,178
I especially 9 you would and avoids the

521
00:32:36,179 --> 00:32:40,679
nine times more hey for any shady me to
be hard to do

522
00:32:40,679 --> 00:32:44,740
disease right out from the text Solis
list I do do see our resources and

523
00:32:44,740 --> 00:32:46,210
visualize it

524
00:32:46,210 --> 00:32:50,409
sinisa same old from the control study
so these are you natalie is the day I

525
00:32:50,409 --> 00:32:53,480
really resent to you what's Monday does
the text

526
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:58,980
Intl sample there are about 40 percent
to win it he said actually included is

527
00:32:58,980 --> 00:32:59,750
seen

528
00:32:59,750 --> 00:33:04,310
solicits I don't source ID number
largest they do not need is a little

529
00:33:04,310 --> 00:33:08,510
I now obvious ninety percent udas

530
00:33:08,510 --> 00:33:12,070
because these low CCTV how's your day
all those is

531
00:33:12,070 --> 00:33:15,879
I don't even need a you least 90 percent
these are the real

532
00:33:15,879 --> 00:33:19,690
you see here now remembered one minus is
easy

533
00:33:19,690 --> 00:33:23,610
tells you how mean you only remaining
natalie is you steal cash

534
00:33:23,610 --> 00:33:28,899
and he's only green you see here when
she's 94 95 percent

535
00:33:28,899 --> 00:33:33,639
also been weighted so 94 95 percent to
work in the

536
00:33:33,639 --> 00:33:37,450
no reason to do a delay in cities least
for you need to

537
00:33:37,450 --> 00:33:41,050
home now legally hold on these Lake she
and

538
00:33:41,050 --> 00:33:47,010
now a in los seis USA says at least me
she eats Hartley added loyal

539
00:33:47,010 --> 00:33:50,820
messy in the ceiling the CIO let me in

540
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:55,810
she should do something so maybe we can
still use some sort of course acting

541
00:33:55,810 --> 00:33:56,908
advice

542
00:33:56,909 --> 00:34:00,889
and these looks like he's been
introduced

543
00:34:00,889 --> 00:34:06,010
so just as the conclusion because we
know the 530 s signing the free beer and

544
00:34:06,010 --> 00:34:08,540
so we want to help you much longer

545
00:34:08,540 --> 00:34:12,110
Andy in the dying to go for it sauce

546
00:34:12,110 --> 00:34:16,409
let's come to is very simple mediation
strategy that usually always using every

547
00:34:16,409 --> 00:34:17,369
day so

548
00:34:17,369 --> 00:34:21,030
should you wear seat mat or not

549
00:34:21,030 --> 00:34:25,280
so this is very simple question and a
day of course the one you like to know

550
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:25,899
all

551
00:34:25,899 --> 00:34:29,089
in their mall this lesson

552
00:34:29,090 --> 00:34:32,869
yes the primary be long time when the
seabed

553
00:34:32,869 --> 00:34:36,990
on peace any man and then the
probability of dying with the cement all

554
00:34:36,990 --> 00:34:41,070
what is it you can still die and this is
important to

555
00:34:41,070 --> 00:34:44,389
to also consider when you consider
security decision

556
00:34:44,389 --> 00:34:48,790
this is no guarantee in making a
decision will not make you happy more

557
00:34:48,790 --> 00:34:53,869
in any sense you can still do I or your
IT infrastructure can still be

558
00:34:53,869 --> 00:34:58,600
so here when you compare to see Francis

559
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:01,930
for safety belts the answer is yes

560
00:35:01,930 --> 00:35:05,109
if you were 16 ounce you can add 14

561
00:35:05,110 --> 00:35:08,880
percent over 40 percent chance is also
by so

562
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:12,280
a you can still die in a car crash if
you wear a safety belt

563
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:15,630
on if the track round summer unicef not
chances

564
00:35:15,630 --> 00:35:18,930
mass m you manner of we did and we now
ticked

565
00:35:18,930 --> 00:35:23,319
and now %uh with this the same things
can be done

566
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:28,390
for the CSS scoring and look I will
explain

567
00:35:28,390 --> 00:35:33,060
so here waded is seasonality is the
feeling just make sure I T Z our

568
00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:37,770
strategy to reduce your risk of dying in
a car accident as much shes

569
00:35:37,770 --> 00:35:41,130
a second jury views you're easily
compromised

570
00:35:41,130 --> 00:35:45,130
where their usual where after my team
and Akershus lol

571
00:35:45,130 --> 00:35:50,950
a what it ends up being that essentially
pension policy establishes

572
00:35:50,950 --> 00:35:54,330
drop outcome right now releases a min

573
00:35:54,330 --> 00:35:57,500
a that logistical

574
00:35:57,500 --> 00:36:02,610
British and the silliness USS if you're
amazing high means forced to assess

575
00:36:02,610 --> 00:36:08,010
course and US any and humidity easy to
make markets you should really not a lot

576
00:36:08,010 --> 00:36:11,070
because this is a decrease in restore
sixty-two percent

577
00:36:11,070 --> 00:36:14,700
is actually an unholy mess he's a
teenager

578
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:19,450
been wearing a seatbelt soul you should
really low sixty-two percent

579
00:36:19,450 --> 00:36:24,589
is a new number looks like it's worth it
ish issue on the NAS I love gossip

the US but I may be larry strolling you

583
00:36:39,580 --> 00:36:42,119
just want to deploy on in ages anyway

584
00:36:42,119 --> 00:36:46,770
okay is up to you can still be worth it
sheesh de diseno easy's you're only

585
00:36:46,770 --> 00:36:48,720

percent of the net tax more Asian base

588
00:36:57,970 --> 00:37:01,600
all you're ready you see dead man 18h

589
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:05,720
I well maybe that is too short for mess

00:38:18,059 --> 00:38:23,839
operator that make power transmission in
the UK in the North vs

600
00:38:23,839 --> 00:38:27,349
of the US the also monitor oil and gas

601
00:38:27,349 --> 00:38:33,150
any really are let Sadie they don't like
too much the US policy in this area is

602
00:38:33,150 --> 00:38:34,390
the US policies

603
00:38:34,390 --> 00:38:38,749
regulatory compliance this as you have
to do these in these in that following

604
00:38:38,749 --> 00:38:39,609
showcase

605
00:38:39,609 --> 00:38:44,348
the UK is that has more memory space so
they will i hack to

606
00:38:44,349 --> 00:38:47,559
forces for example for sandy Pasch face
on the number

607
00:38:47,559 --> 00:38:52,069
miss o'leary I wanna be when filing this
project because they want to see

608
00:38:52,069 --> 00:38:57,349
Barkley said strong evidence that
sometimes a regulatory compliance is not

609
00:38:57,349 --> 00:39:00,799
a good thing to do because it's forcing
them to spend too much money

610
00:39:00,799 --> 00:39:04,339
wished and Reapers often the castle hire
make knife to pay higher

611
00:39:04,339 --> 00:39:07,479
fee for the electricity they are they
oil and gas fell

612
00:39:07,479 --> 00:39:11,219
with respect class soul that's why it's
a

613
00:39:11,219 --> 00:39:14,910
regulatory compliance maybe blasts for

614
00:39:14,910 --> 00:39:18,170
my and 90s because then you are if daddy

615
00:39:18,170 --> 00:39:21,910
mas or field in you're happy nobody can
sue you

616
00:39:21,910 --> 00:39:25,359
but from the point of view of the masses
many night with plain

617
00:39:25,359 --> 00:39:30,650
so that's why it's there the decision
for safety man was a deployment

618
00:39:30,650 --> 00:39:35,650
governmental decision and this is my
hand on my 42 present study wanna see s

619
00:39:35,650 --> 00:39:38,739
decision is not backing out my other
number send at least one within this

620
00:39:38,739 --> 00:39:40,699
study shows up is not a good number

621
00:39:40,699 --> 00:39:46,039
in in the general sense so maybe more my
fear

622
00:39:46,039 --> 00:39:49,660
then by email rations the season think
that's the 1i their

623
00:39:49,660 --> 00:39:56,660
here it's a good question I mean I think
the only thing I'm really glad to be

624
00:40:08,709 --> 00:40:09,198
done

625
00:40:09,199 --> 00:40:12,289
and on 54 K

626
00:40:12,289 --> 00:40:15,819
some balls that was a general is showing
up is too small number to make and it's

627
00:40:15,819 --> 00:40:16,829
the best sex

628
00:40:16,829 --> 00:40:20,469
I on the

629
00:40:20,469 --> 00:40:27,469
possible I know anything can happen

630
00:40:40,910 --> 00:40:45,799
yet to do that any news RSS easily find
assumption we assume that the DA's

631
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:49,770
an Air India proportion to the number of
vulnerabilities the nearly

632
00:40:49,770 --> 00:40:54,890
is the alienist a i sorries I know it's
much more costly to

633
00:40:54,890 --> 00:41:00,410
in on Tony just for the human cost of
doing it so we assume the least video

634
00:41:00,410 --> 00:41:07,410
where bomb

635
00:41:15,670 --> 00:41:22,670
all

636
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:37,520
said

637
00:41:40,820 --> 00:41:43,140
so so this is a eighty

638
00:41:43,140 --> 00:41:46,839
lets a different problem make this is
what happens if you can only catch in

639
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:47,620
batch s

640
00:41:47,620 --> 00:41:52,089
that's for the shoa I pay all four at
once or not at once

641
00:41:52,090 --> 00:41:55,720
and basically may decided that the
addition one maybe

642
00:41:55,720 --> 00:42:00,440
banner of then 0 and food is this is a
sighting if not I'm

643
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:04,790
so what happens if yes only noxious you
can only have to choose between

644
00:42:04,790 --> 00:42:07,990
disable me for example Microsoft

645
00:42:07,990 --> 00:42:11,580
past you say is it just click the box
Don Pachi anything

646
00:42:11,580 --> 00:42:15,150
Anne or a different bank so we have not
II

647
00:42:15,150 --> 00:42:18,380
highlights what happens in this case if
the number still works

648
00:42:18,380 --> 00:42:21,730
but this would be a different status quo
shock analysis

649
00:42:21,730 --> 00:42:25,680
that a you have not actually if they can
add

650
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:30,549
something here i am. the National
Convention easy what you said his agency

651
00:42:30,550 --> 00:42:31,450
me coz

652
00:42:31,450 --> 00:42:34,620
I didn't change the assembly

653
00:42:34,620 --> 00:42:37,690
so here when you need some you need a
sample here

654
00:42:37,690 --> 00:42:43,130
a diesel no where is it J these will
need to receive additional C-seventeen

655
00:42:43,130 --> 00:42:47,420
H is a one-man show all the soldiers it
easy to deploy lei

656
00:42:47,420 --> 00:42:50,830
financially sees one Mangini sample is
one case each

657
00:42:50,830 --> 00:42:54,400
Asia Asian Azzi treaties so a lil

658
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:57,570
you are right and we need to change the
numbers

659
00:42:57,570 --> 00:43:03,910
Latin our assumption here is this soon
because only considers

660
00:43:03,910 --> 00:43:08,420
the Casa ole if it's only 20 percent
improvement

661
00:43:08,420 --> 00:43:12,320
for all I medium what is it with the

662
00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:15,900
impacts I'll the you know did

663
00:43:15,900 --> 00:43:19,850
the owner goods we didn't match is
significantly larger

664
00:43:19,850 --> 00:43:23,600
then you look awesome Oilers badges and
he hasn't been for further study but it

665
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:26,770
seems like that you gotta compare that
against the possible impact on

666
00:43:26,770 --> 00:43:30,210
the ones you miss %uh universe is the

667
00:43:30,210 --> 00:43:33,340
the Casa employers it is more important
factor I would think

668
00:43:33,340 --> 00:43:37,410
hom a female cost Southern Miss

669
00:43:37,410 --> 00:43:40,799
should be at it's a at

670
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:44,240
it's a different virus that should be
considered separately met when we can

671
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:45,070
see here

672
00:43:45,070 --> 00:43:49,950
me call here yeah so when we can see
here the

673
00:43:49,950 --> 00:43:55,440
sense of fairness essentially say okay
in like in this example there's no

674
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:57,420
reference from from your perspective

675
00:43:57,420 --> 00:44:01,110
once Internet Explorer is hacked its
Internet has started to spin hacks

676
00:44:01,110 --> 00:44:03,810
assassins use in the same condition

677
00:44:03,810 --> 00:44:06,920
should not be a difference where they
exploit one who never be

678
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:11,490
lorena so this would be neutral to the
impact that's why it's important and

679
00:44:11,490 --> 00:44:12,940
decided to say we only

680
00:44:12,940 --> 00:44:15,990
I could make things that are similar
occur

681
00:44:15,990 --> 00:44:19,290
because if you have internet this story
doesn't matter if it's

682
00:44:19,290 --> 00:44:23,790
for acts all live in a community solace
you know this morning has been hacked

683
00:44:23,790 --> 00:44:27,700
but you're still suggesting that we
don't have certain

684
00:44:27,700 --> 00:44:31,570
high and medium own abilities aids yeah

685
00:44:31,570 --> 00:44:36,800
no no no he told me that he can issue
mates of do I think that's the

686
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:40,570
reasonable those things to say is that
you ollie

687
00:44:40,570 --> 00:44:43,700
they say marker is the CSS for

688
00:44:43,700 --> 00:44:48,190
occur that's bad judgment but as for
example is reset here as

689
00:44:48,190 --> 00:44:52,990
like the and friends in glorious quickly
so for example this means say if you

690
00:44:52,990 --> 00:44:55,620
have one if you look under the Beeline

691
00:44:55,620 --> 00:44:59,190
right so this means you have one plenty
to eat ass

692
00:44:59,190 --> 00:45:02,920
expertise as assessed with the CSS for
his side army

693
00:45:02,920 --> 00:45:07,010
enhance for raises the vulnerabilities
in mass flight so this season is about

694
00:45:07,010 --> 00:45:08,100
to be in

695
00:45:08,100 --> 00:45:11,850
available proof of concepts and your
risk

696
00:45:11,850 --> 00:45:16,100
decreases by any process is much better
see me this means simply that you need

697
00:45:16,100 --> 00:45:16,950
you had

698
00:45:16,950 --> 00:45:22,510
more information did not just always
something relations manager thats assets

699
00:45:22,510 --> 00:45:26,190
if there's only this year release losing
your money

700
00:45:26,190 --> 00:45:32,420
make sense thank you well I appealed to
the

701
00:45:32,420 --> 00:45:36,870
on Greek i do. the unknown God and that
is

702
00:45:36,870 --> 00:45:42,430
chorus there are vulnerable or there are
slight out there that are not can't

703
00:45:42,430 --> 00:45:45,740
or not reporter so that's other

704
00:45:45,740 --> 00:45:49,030
some small statistical problem were also
say

705
00:45:49,030 --> 00:45:52,790
faced with a lot water lot has a large
corporations

706
00:45:52,790 --> 00:45:56,220
waiting around for next play to come out
this case

707
00:45:56,220 --> 00:46:01,440
arm you're already way behind at that
point it may not be out already at may

708
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:02,790
show up later

709
00:46:02,790 --> 00:46:06,220
that so they'll be reportedly so
reporting bias

710
00:46:06,220 --> 00:46:09,510
just a couple cuts am

711
00:46:09,510 --> 00:46:13,230
so the the let's say and

712
00:46:13,230 --> 00:46:16,360
you race 2 leashes and that let me take
them separately

713
00:46:16,360 --> 00:46:19,380
so of course there are some things are
not report

714
00:46:19,380 --> 00:46:23,200
rights and my for easy use Symantec

715
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:26,670
as a one some hope but maybe kasperski's
different

716
00:46:26,670 --> 00:46:30,770
or make a feast sent or maybe the
information at Citibank ass is different

717
00:46:30,770 --> 00:46:31,259
the game

718
00:46:31,260 --> 00:46:34,280
but the important thing is psyched to
make make the control so they did not

719
00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:36,600
the way that the side works in the same

720
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:40,210
in the smoky me cass is studied at that
we look at it

721
00:46:40,210 --> 00:46:44,670
the only did the study on England &amp

722
00:46:44,670 --> 00:46:48,360
is general enough to make the conclusion
also applicable to people in United

723
00:46:48,360 --> 00:46:49,570
States or in China

724
00:46:49,570 --> 00:46:53,300
so that's why I also reminded the
conclusion

725
00:46:53,300 --> 00:46:56,510
it may work for other that assess and

726
00:46:56,510 --> 00:47:00,290
for this one in a million people come I
mean yeah of course but

727
00:47:00,290 --> 00:47:04,720
and as I said we have no real answer for
the Black Swan

728
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:08,390
and I E this is SMB Donna completely de
France

729
00:47:08,390 --> 00:47:11,410
said scenarios arce

730
00:47:11,410 --> 00:47:14,710
criteria see if you're worried about the
Black Swan then you need

731
00:47:14,710 --> 00:47:19,790
different techniques are different but
yes you can use that this text

732
00:47:19,790 --> 00:47:24,820
okay

733
00:47:24,820 --> 00:47:29,350
so and CSS a giving the kids a CVSS base
'cause

734
00:47:29,350 --> 00:47:32,490
under analysis I'm but they're actually
three

735
00:47:32,490 --> 00:47:36,040
components in CSS those on when it
reaches

736
00:47:36,040 --> 00:47:40,220
CBS s temperance schools actually tell
you whether and

737
00:47:40,220 --> 00:47:43,870
thereof under diseases known about with
these patches whether it's been

738
00:47:43,870 --> 00:47:45,270
exploited or whatever

739
00:47:45,270 --> 00:47:49,140
did you think of the actually including
bass in your opinion research is even

740
00:47:49,140 --> 00:47:50,680
decades you

741
00:47:50,680 --> 00:47:54,410
you know more accurate numbers in terms
its side amid match

742
00:47:54,410 --> 00:47:58,480
yen Allaah we we are here referring to
what to this time just tell you

743
00:47:58,480 --> 00:48:01,080
understand just tell you for example if
the detainees

744
00:48:01,080 --> 00:48:05,340
protocol it as you you date is USS the
score and you use it

745
00:48:05,340 --> 00:48:09,700
at the point is that today underscores
the Denver score into their mentors 47

746
00:48:09,700 --> 00:48:11,440
expensive to compute

747
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:14,870
solely to me and really see any you need
a CDJ

748
00:48:14,870 --> 00:48:19,700
how these genes with it and broke but in
reality a is that nobody really computes

749
00:48:19,700 --> 00:48:20,390
it because he

750
00:48:20,390 --> 00:48:24,330
jest eight is too much effort it would
delay there are too many women to be

751
00:48:24,330 --> 00:48:25,720
needed you need to run

752
00:48:25,720 --> 00:48:29,650
eater who will experts only 21 been in
use for rent and buy me take

753
00:48:29,650 --> 00:48:34,330
so everybody's using the score and
actually sees what somebody stands in

754
00:48:34,330 --> 00:48:37,870
attending you to do so this is what we
are sure to be there with his tiny

755
00:48:37,870 --> 00:48:42,020
but of course you need to see to see
other things change is possible

756
00:48:42,020 --> 00:48:45,070
with it seems like you don't go to the
work to tackle a temple school

757
00:48:45,070 --> 00:48:50,160
because you lifted by the and these and
abilities are next like it's for example

758
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:54,279
so I mean you're pretty much most the
way there too Dec 18 temporal

759
00:48:54,280 --> 00:48:57,290
and then OK unionization to you know

760
00:48:57,290 --> 00:49:00,960
to go a little bit but then you have
done actually modify the base cool

761
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:04,100
with improvements to see what you end up
in

762
00:49:04,100 --> 00:49:07,880
a now linden yes it is to the damn bro
question because

763
00:49:07,880 --> 00:49:12,020
its a.m. yes in nineteen other side is
that you have done for racism

764
00:49:12,020 --> 00:49:16,650
browsers and son i deleted Embrun
information that you have available in

765
00:49:16,650 --> 00:49:18,300
the NPD on the other databases

766
00:49:18,300 --> 00:49:23,930
absolutely not rely so you don't want to
be a NES that the state so any evidence

767
00:49:23,930 --> 00:49:26,350
based on the fact that the one that
ability s

768
00:49:26,350 --> 00:49:30,580
disclose it day one or day to war 1mon
paid its

769
00:49:30,580 --> 00:49:34,080
and yes even really saw in this session
has actually I'm

770
00:49:34,080 --> 00:49:38,509
have been saying the same thing so
member information is very unreliable

771
00:49:38,510 --> 00:49:42,170
and this is how good we have an honest I
find schism trauma we find out there

772
00:49:42,170 --> 00:49:47,530
Francis the MBT was the oldest scenes
prices and I'm version 21

773
00:49:47,530 --> 00:49:51,040
we look at the Colts and the corn and a
certain point disappear

774
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:54,040
so if there's no hold responsible for
that will not believe you can understand

775
00:49:54,040 --> 00:49:57,070
it is normal in a meeting this offer
because the court is not

776
00:49:57,070 --> 00:50:00,310
their soul I wouldn't do any suggests

777
00:50:00,310 --> 00:50:03,509
space on what's the deal disclosure and
saw

778
00:50:03,510 --> 00:50:06,640
you can nest on three drafts number by
year

779
00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:11,049
dennis o'hare the dampers for becomes
completely useless

780
00:50:11,050 --> 00:50:14,160
so the only things that make this race
Texas since

781
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:18,170
the bid will be in this thing will be to
not the numbers maybe not gonna actually

782
00:50:18,170 --> 00:50:21,020
yes some numbers that that's esta llena

783
00:50:21,020 --> 00:50:25,080
process processing the same wanna be's
not exploited the same number

784
00:50:25,080 --> 00:50:28,160
time don't find the same number of
exploits

785
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:31,850
some amenities are exploited for me
lease hands

786
00:50:31,850 --> 00:50:36,440
so you would find munis of sending its
flights and open up the dancefloor

787
00:50:36,440 --> 00:50:41,040
house so this in the morning the same
metrics to conceive

788
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:44,190
so many exploits you find the one not
just the excess

789
00:50:44,190 --> 00:50:48,190
year and only working on exists but the
number may be more names

790
00:50:48,190 --> 00:50:51,450
rather than this would be a sort of
environmental matters is more

791
00:50:51,450 --> 00:50:52,880
interesting

792
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:59,880
Mandy just the timbre information

793
00:51:01,160 --> 00:51:04,940
Angie thank you one things we're going
to the

794
00:51:04,940 --> 00:51:11,940
go ahead yet but with silly five minutes
I'm so glad

795
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:25,350
well I think in some cases you see there
were any there is some

796
00:51:25,350 --> 00:51:28,529
some solution that you need to ask to
see their additional

797
00:51:28,530 --> 00:51:32,430
information in the India CBS ass that's
one will be to say

798
00:51:32,430 --> 00:51:37,250
what Alice yes he's there is information

799
00:51:37,250 --> 00:51:40,700
not only the individual assessment the
vulnerability but for this

800
00:51:40,700 --> 00:51:45,290
need to think more and I deeply ass on
some ideas and then communicate this to

801
00:51:45,290 --> 00:51:45,600
the

802
00:51:45,600 --> 00:51:50,200
lead this year's that's working group in
in the future

803
00:51:50,200 --> 00:51:53,850
is now I don't die I don't like to have
I came back to force a solution

804
00:51:53,850 --> 00:51:56,900
fun spot the proposals but that will not
be there nice

805
00:51:56,900 --> 00:52:00,300
and not be very effective as well

806
00:52:00,300 --> 00:52:06,310
and I if this makes you happy probably
not

807
00:52:06,310 --> 00:52:13,310
home

808
00:52:15,590 --> 00:52:22,590
that is not solution yet

809
00:52:36,950 --> 00:52:42,750
yeah but this isn't life

810
00:52:42,750 --> 00:52:47,590
I anyway we at we do I in touch with
with the people for two assists vs on

811
00:52:47,590 --> 00:52:48,070
mean we

812
00:52:48,070 --> 00:52:51,940
we will %uh hopefully club not my man I
don't know who'd collaborated

813
00:52:51,940 --> 00:52:55,450
active Wii Wii actually with a and
actually

814
00:52:55,450 --> 00:53:00,600
other ideas that I roaming around the
scene of the season trained the we we

815
00:53:00,600 --> 00:53:02,780
are trying two days then and we will %uh

816
00:53:02,780 --> 00:53:06,200
at come back to the community a
gentlemanly and complete results now

817
00:53:06,200 --> 00:53:06,940
it's more than that

818
00:53:06,940 --> 00:53:10,320
feely between US mids tool out

819
00:53:10,320 --> 00:53:15,580
the scene that likelihood problem in
particular

820
00:53:15,580 --> 00:53:19,000
all us yes

821
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:24,920
were yeah it is

822
00:53:24,920 --> 00:53:28,680
and yet we will be in touch with sex

823
00:53:28,680 --> 00:53:32,310
okay thing that's no more question we
want to all

824
00:53:32,310 --> 00:53:39,310
I'll light on

825
00:53:51,270 --> 00:53:55,730
well at the EC's in limine and the
University Center we're doing it wasn't

826
00:53:55,730 --> 00:54:00,460
me a few months old Mikey T do disease
together but now the first artery is up

827
00:54:00,460 --> 00:54:02,890
and running and he does not take much
school

828
00:54:02,890 --> 00:54:07,000
the data sets so of course you have to
put some effort to the beginning but

829
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:07,810
after a while

830
00:54:07,810 --> 00:54:11,190
needs he is not high enough to go

831
00:54:11,190 --> 00:54:14,340
have said that there is a break because
you need to know Russian

832
00:54:14,340 --> 00:54:19,160
ahead for for some of the x5 K so that
look is an irrationally at the russian

833
00:54:19,160 --> 00:54:19,950
students

834
00:54:19,950 --> 00:54:23,600
for for some point trashing it is as
though this work if you don't do right

835
00:54:23,600 --> 00:54:24,740
dunno ration

836
00:54:24,740 --> 00:54:28,020
then you may have a problem in
extracting information from its like key

837
00:54:28,020 --> 00:54:31,160
for instance on so that president

838
00:54:31,160 --> 00:54:35,319
me it really is you need to know

839
00:54:35,320 --> 00:54:40,510
been

840
00:54:40,510 --> 00:54:45,810
him

841
00:54:45,810 --> 00:54:49,380
ha

842
00:54:49,380 --> 00:54:56,380
all

843
00:55:03,670 --> 00:55:07,730
he and all that is easily done it comes
out of the data sets a tire publish the

844
00:55:07,730 --> 00:55:12,920
use and that SEIU on at least the season
ability is going to look at so did the

845
00:55:12,920 --> 00:55:15,310
study was to be a reflection of the is

846
00:55:15,310 --> 00:55:18,960
identity ays s problems he said

847
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:23,680
before mess in the city really used as
much as the school already is being used

848
00:55:23,680 --> 00:55:25,950
as a base for even if he is not

849
00:55:25,950 --> 00:55:29,090
this is Jess this agency says they are
now

850
00:55:29,090 --> 00:55:32,560
I so we just wanted to introduce the
stolen and of course many days a lot of

851
00:55:32,560 --> 00:55:33,140
problems

852
00:55:33,140 --> 00:55:37,190
switching to mediate a lot I see said
was Dorsey said the Fournet

853
00:55:37,190 --> 00:55:40,940
salud any weed too loudly rejected women
abilities

854
00:55:40,940 --> 00:55:44,420
we Colleen NEC was escorted to a
reported

855
00:55:44,420 --> 00:55:47,470
me I N A your stuff like that we easy

856
00:55:47,470 --> 00:55:51,600
that controls are you be an eight st.
Louis is not the city's what these

857
00:55:51,600 --> 00:55:57,240
out there and what these widely used so
we wanted to have been used at

858
00:55:57,240 --> 00:56:02,200
I think our Proctor is signing that we
are close to the hands

859
00:56:02,200 --> 00:56:05,280
sold thank you owe you for coming and
for your questions
