getting up bright and early to come see

15
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:38,849
my presentation this morning today I'm

16
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:40,860
gonna be talking to you about testing

17
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:44,010
your organization's social media

18
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:46,530
awareness so the presentation today is

19
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:48,320
going to be split into two parts first

20
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:50,879
thing we were talk about social media

21
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:53,010
why I think it's important and why we

22
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:54,360
think we should be testing it and then

23
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:57,180
we're going to move into the practical

24
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:58,590
part of the presentation in the second

25
00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:00,210
half and I'm gonna be talking to you

26
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:02,280
about to open source tools I've

27
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:05,189
developed called social mapper and

28
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:08,070
social attacker which hopefully you'll

29
00:01:05,188 --> 00:01:11,639
be able to take away and start testing

30
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:12,839
organizations social media awareness so

31
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:16,439
yeah

32
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:18,570
Who am I my name is Jacob Wilkin I'm a

33
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:21,199
security consultant slash penetration

34
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:24,000
tester slash red teamer slash hacker

35
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:26,090
over the last couple of years I've

36
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,950
performed hundreds of penetration tests

37
00:01:26,090 --> 00:01:31,530
including social social engineering

38
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:33,450
engagements and network test Web Apps

39
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:36,990
all that stuff I've hacked into multiple

40
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:39,750
banks all legally don't worry and the

41
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:41,939
creator of spray and social mapper to

42
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:44,579
open-source tools and I'm also British

43
00:01:41,939 --> 00:01:47,298
so I apologize if I apologize too much

44
00:01:44,579 --> 00:01:47,298
in this presentation

45
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:50,640
thank you

46
00:01:51,130 --> 00:01:57,670
so social media why is it a big deal so

47
00:01:54,790 --> 00:01:59,980
this graphic from HootSuite sort shows

48
00:01:57,670 --> 00:02:02,080
you some basic stats about the internet

49
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:04,120
and social media and stuff you know

50
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:07,770
seven point six people a billion people

51
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:10,240
in the population 4.3 billion of them

52
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:14,230
now connected to the Internet

53
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:17,080
3.4 billion people are now active social

54
00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:18,910
media users if I've done my maths right

55
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:22,390
I believe you combine those two numbers

56
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:24,430
and that's about 80% of the population

57
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:27,250
that is connected to the Internet

58
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:28,600
our active social media users that means

59
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:31,630
that you know about four four and five

60
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:34,690
people are on social media and then as

61
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:36,460
you can see in the last one most people

62
00:02:34,690 --> 00:02:38,260
are connecting to it from mobile devices

63
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:41,650
and I will come back to why that's

64
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:43,120
important a little bit later so but why

65
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:46,000
do you care why do you care about social

66
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:46,840
media well social media fishing is on

67
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:52,360
the rise

68
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:53,470
in 2017 it went up by 500% in 2018 and

69
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:55,930
went up by a hundred percent again

70
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:58,000
according to a Proofpoint report that's

71
00:02:55,930 --> 00:03:02,380
a tenfold increase in social media based

72
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:04,060
fishing over the last 2 or 3 years it's

73
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:05,530
now preferred vector for attackers so

74
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:07,360
actually there is more social media

75
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:08,950
fishing or fishing and going on on

76
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:12,910
social media and there is our of our

77
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:15,579
business emails and it's easy to see why

78
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:16,900
when you look at the statistics 33

79
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:18,280
percent click rates you're getting on

80
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:19,510
social media just because you know

81
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:20,560
people on social media people are

82
00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:23,859
clicking things it's what you do on

83
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:25,600
social media versus 11% for on average

84
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:28,720
for business email so so you're three

85
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:31,390
times more likely to be able to get your

86
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:35,800
click throughs on on social media and

87
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:37,000
this is important because companies are

88
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:40,030
you know that they're moving towards

89
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,410
bring-your-own-device models you know so

90
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:43,750
people are going to be on their devices

91
00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:44,709
at home on social media they're going to

92
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:46,780
be bringing them into your work

93
00:03:44,709 --> 00:03:48,459
environments and even if you you know

94
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:49,900
still ship out your own devices like

95
00:03:48,459 --> 00:03:51,250
your laptops and phones give them to

96
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:52,510
your employees they're gonna go on them

97
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:55,570
in their breaks they're going to go on

98
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:58,600
them after work and so on and what this

99
00:03:55,570 --> 00:03:59,609
means is that social media becomes an

100
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:01,920
alternative

101
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:04,650
vector into your organization so you

102
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:06,959
know and you know you guys know about

103
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:08,730
you know normal fishing pretext like

104
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:10,380
credential bass fishing you know what if

105
00:04:08,730 --> 00:04:13,170
their Facebook password is the same as

106
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:14,340
their Active Directory password and

107
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:16,469
they've got show credentials so it's

108
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:18,329
very similar you know malicious file

109
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:20,549
downloads browser exploitation all sorts

110
00:04:18,329 --> 00:04:22,230
of stuff like that and if these

111
00:04:20,548 --> 00:04:25,830
campaigns come through on social media I

112
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:28,250
mean the first one the credential based

113
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:31,650
fishing that's probably the most likely

114
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:34,110
one to be an issue just because they'll

115
00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:37,919
be on mobile devices as I said in the

116
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:41,070
slide before so probably unless you're

117
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:43,169
up against like an apt or a nation-state

118
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:44,730
the malicious file downloads and browser

119
00:04:43,169 --> 00:04:49,380
exploitations aren't so much of an issue

120
00:04:44,730 --> 00:04:52,020
on Android and iOS so so how do we

121
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:53,550
address this if social media is an issue

122
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:55,950
how do we address this in our

123
00:04:53,550 --> 00:04:58,020
organizations so as I'm sure you know

124
00:04:55,950 --> 00:05:00,599
from the title of the talk but you just

125
00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:05,669
walked into I'm an advocate of improving

126
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:07,229
awareness we can run mock campaigns to

127
00:05:05,669 --> 00:05:08,849
identify who's at risk the same as you

128
00:05:07,229 --> 00:05:12,419
would with normal email based phishing

129
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:15,240
and I see this evolving into two types

130
00:05:12,419 --> 00:05:17,359
of tests really a more passive social

131
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:23,130
media based test and a more active

132
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:25,770
social media based test so moving on to

133
00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:27,870
it so social map is a tool I developed

134
00:05:25,770 --> 00:05:32,460
last year I've released it a black hat

135
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:34,320
arsenal this is how I see you doing

136
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:39,150
passive testing on your organization's

137
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:42,270
employees for full social media

138
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:44,609
awareness how it works is at a piping

139
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:46,200
tool and you basically feed in a

140
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:47,850
LinkedIn company name and it does a

141
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:52,099
reverse search based off the LinkedIn

142
00:05:47,850 --> 00:05:55,500
company name and it's crêpes off all the

143
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:56,970
social it's great for all the names and

144
00:05:55,500 --> 00:06:00,450
the images of all the people that work

145
00:05:56,970 --> 00:06:01,830
at that company or you can do some open

146
00:06:00,450 --> 00:06:04,150
source intelligence of your own and

147
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:07,090
you'll be able to just feed in a

148
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:10,150
list of URLs to someone's image and a

149
00:06:07,090 --> 00:06:12,489
list of names as well and what it does

150
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:14,979
is it instruments the Firefox web

151
00:06:12,490 --> 00:06:16,780
browser logs into the social media sites

152
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:18,460
with your credentials and then starts

153
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:20,349
doing name based searches and then

154
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:23,500
narrowing the results down using facial

155
00:06:20,350 --> 00:06:28,000
recognition the point of this would be

156
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:30,430
you can enumerate all the profiles of

157
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,680
your employees that are linked back to

158
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:35,320
your LinkedIn organization or all that

159
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:38,260
you found online and this is fairly

160
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:40,450
quick I mean depends on your definition

161
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:43,030
of quick it takes about 24 hours to run

162
00:06:40,450 --> 00:06:44,830
on a thousand people but you know for to

163
00:06:43,030 --> 00:06:46,539
run like a test this it's not too bad

164
00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:48,960
it's less intrusive you know you'd

165
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:53,170
actually have to interact with these

166
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:54,520
employee profiles the cons are that you

167
00:06:53,170 --> 00:06:57,820
know you're identifying employee

168
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:59,370
profiles but you're not actually testing

169
00:06:57,820 --> 00:07:01,540
them you don't know if they're going to

170
00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:02,650
accept connection requests you don't

171
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:06,280
know if they're going to click on links

172
00:07:02,650 --> 00:07:08,080
that get sent to them and so on and this

173
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:12,669
is what a social map looks like you can

174
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:15,640
see it's a terminal tool sorry the image

175
00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:18,040
quality isn't amazing I'll try and point

176
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:20,050
to the various bits over here so you can

177
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:22,890
see at the top of the piping tool you

178
00:07:20,050 --> 00:07:25,660
can see we set the company name to

179
00:07:22,890 --> 00:07:27,880
Trustwave so we're fishing or we're

180
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:29,920
looking for social media accounts

181
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:31,960
belonging to Trustwave employees we said

182
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:34,660
it to fast mode this fast and accurate

183
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:38,830
mode I could is more accurate faster is

184
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:43,090
faster sitting it on a Facebook LinkedIn

185
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:46,240
Twitter Google+ and Instagram and then

186
00:07:43,090 --> 00:07:49,390
what happens is it go it goes on

187
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:51,880
LinkedIn finds the company ID pulls that

188
00:07:49,390 --> 00:07:53,950
out and then start scraping employees

189
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:55,510
off LinkedIn so so you can actually only

190
00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:58,719
pull out a thousand people but you know

191
00:07:55,510 --> 00:08:03,060
this is a thousand profiles and Victor's

192
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:06,340
into your organization that possible so

193
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:07,570
and then in this example below so you

194
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:10,270
have to imagine this is this is running

195
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:11,950
on one person but this is running on a

196
00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:13,419
thousand people so this is what would

197
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:16,060
have you happening on a mass scale in

198
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:17,210
the top example and you can see for

199
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:20,539
Lawrence

200
00:08:17,210 --> 00:08:22,849
it logged into the Facebook his for

201
00:08:20,539 --> 00:08:24,500
sorry the Facebook with our account and

202
00:08:22,850 --> 00:08:26,479
it found a match it finds his Facebook

203
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:29,180
profile it tries to do the same on

204
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:32,449
Twitter doesn't find anything try to see

205
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:33,620
the same on Instagram infants and finds

206
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:35,390
a profile but this is happening on a

207
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:37,010
mass scale you know with thousands of

208
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:38,899
people or more if you if you do it

209
00:08:37,010 --> 00:08:41,779
manually and feed to feed more than a

210
00:08:38,899 --> 00:08:43,399
thousand in and what you're getting from

211
00:08:41,779 --> 00:08:47,140
this is something like this so you're

212
00:08:43,399 --> 00:08:50,270
getting a report from social map

213
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:53,720
detailing your employees or your targets

214
00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:57,670
social media basically their presence

215
00:08:53,720 --> 00:09:00,920
online right so you can see in this one

216
00:08:57,670 --> 00:09:04,010
from the man on the top we we put out

217
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:05,689
his LinkedIn profile and then we've used

218
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:08,720
that to enumerate his Facebook profile

219
00:09:05,690 --> 00:09:11,750
for the lady here we've found her a

220
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:13,730
Facebook Twitter and her Google+ profile

221
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:16,250
I know Google+ doesn't exist anymore

222
00:09:13,730 --> 00:09:19,279
this has some old images it's actually

223
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:20,899
not not part of the tool anymore yeah

224
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:22,550
and then for the man on the bottom the

225
00:09:20,899 --> 00:09:27,160
same thing has the LinkedIn profile we

226
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:27,160
found his Facebook Twitter and Google+

227
00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:33,469
and that would be a huge document you

228
00:09:30,529 --> 00:09:36,770
know with like thousands of thousands of

229
00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:39,470
people in it so moving on to the second

230
00:09:36,770 --> 00:09:42,350
type of testing so this is a tool called

231
00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:46,100
social attacker I am so you can actually

232
00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:48,860
do active testing with social media I'm

233
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:50,839
releasing it works out now on github at

234
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:52,160
least that yesterday if you want to hear

235
00:09:50,839 --> 00:09:54,290
more about it so I'm going to go over a

236
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:55,310
really high level in this talk if you

237
00:09:54,290 --> 00:09:57,380
want to hear more about here I'll

238
00:09:55,310 --> 00:09:59,719
actually be presenting over at blackhat

239
00:09:57,380 --> 00:10:00,380
Arsenal at 10 a.m. come ask some

240
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:02,750
questions

241
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:07,339
I've got stickers that I made in

242
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:09,610
Microsoft Paint that you can pick up yes

243
00:10:07,339 --> 00:10:12,610
I say yes a social attacker you feed in

244
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:12,610
sorry

245
00:10:18,139 --> 00:10:23,250
so so social attacker is the same as

246
00:10:21,570 --> 00:10:26,250
social mapper instruments the Firefox

247
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:29,130
web browser that this time instead of

248
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:31,170
just finding people it logs into the

249
00:10:29,130 --> 00:10:33,630
social media sites and it starts sending

250
00:10:31,170 --> 00:10:36,870
the targets that you feed in so you feed

251
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:38,820
in the social mapper results into social

252
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:40,769
attacker and it goes to other profiles

253
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:44,639
for all the people it's found it starts

254
00:10:40,769 --> 00:10:45,839
connecting to those profiles sending

255
00:10:44,639 --> 00:10:47,940
them you know friend requests on

256
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:50,660
facebook connection requests on LinkedIn

257
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:54,180
following them on Twitter sending them

258
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:57,600
friend requests on VK and then waits

259
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:59,370
awhile for the users you can specify the

260
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:02,430
time I usually go like 24 hours or

261
00:10:59,370 --> 00:11:04,079
something and then it waits for the user

262
00:11:02,430 --> 00:11:06,899
is obviously interact with what you've

263
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:08,459
sent them accept the request and anyone

264
00:11:06,899 --> 00:11:11,519
who does accept the connection requests

265
00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:14,130
and everyone you follow on Twitter then

266
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:16,079
gets sent phishing messages that you

267
00:11:14,130 --> 00:11:17,670
define you know see it's up to you to do

268
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:20,760
your pretext for your campaign however

269
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:22,560
you want to do it that's the benefits of

270
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:24,089
this are you know you get full testing

271
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:26,250
you're actually connecting with people

272
00:11:24,089 --> 00:11:28,980
you're seeing who's accepting connection

273
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:31,589
requests from strangers who they don't

274
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:34,130
know you see who's actually clicking on

275
00:11:31,589 --> 00:11:36,810
links that you send them and you know

276
00:11:34,130 --> 00:11:39,240
yes it's like a full full testing suite

277
00:11:36,810 --> 00:11:40,859
the cons of this is it's slower you have

278
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:43,319
to run social mapper then run social

279
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:45,480
attacker so it's a longer test period

280
00:11:43,319 --> 00:11:47,639
but also you know I do recognize that

281
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:49,050
Theo is intrusive on private profiles

282
00:11:47,639 --> 00:11:51,569
you're having to connect directly and

283
00:11:49,050 --> 00:11:55,109
test your employees social media

284
00:11:51,569 --> 00:11:59,160
profiles so again what this looks like

285
00:11:55,110 --> 00:12:02,510
in the terminal you can see you feed in

286
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:04,529
it's a Python tool again you feed in the

287
00:12:02,510 --> 00:12:07,139
social mapper results

288
00:12:04,529 --> 00:12:09,510
we specify the add fish function so just

289
00:12:07,139 --> 00:12:12,149
adding people and then fishing them we

290
00:12:09,510 --> 00:12:15,510
do - a which is fish all social media

291
00:12:12,149 --> 00:12:17,399
sites and that are in the tool and then

292
00:12:15,510 --> 00:12:19,620
we set our message so I'll just our

293
00:12:17,399 --> 00:12:21,990
basic pretext for this is hey first name

294
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:25,410
what do you think of this with your

295
00:12:21,990 --> 00:12:26,270
fishing link and you can see this it's

296
00:12:25,410 --> 00:12:27,469
got some

297
00:12:26,270 --> 00:12:29,180
basic stuff so you can be a bit more

298
00:12:27,470 --> 00:12:31,130
dynamic with your fishing messages so

299
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:33,290
first name gets a written by the first

300
00:12:31,130 --> 00:12:35,990
name of the person and the tracking ID

301
00:12:33,290 --> 00:12:39,860
that's a unique tracking ID so you can

302
00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:41,930
properly test test who's clicking on the

303
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:45,620
links and we have some stuff in the tool

304
00:12:41,930 --> 00:12:48,260
as well which basically blocks out the

305
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:51,320
Facebook and Twitter crawlers so you

306
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:54,670
don't get poisoned logs by say if you

307
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:57,320
see sorry so you don't get poisoned logs

308
00:12:54,670 --> 00:12:58,729
by the crawlers and it doesn't just look

309
00:12:57,320 --> 00:13:00,140
like everyone's clicked on the links you

310
00:12:58,730 --> 00:13:02,480
actually know who has clicked on your

311
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:04,370
link and then this is just some stuff to

312
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:06,650
do verbose output and show the browser

313
00:13:04,370 --> 00:13:09,020
key so you can see the BRIT so you can

314
00:13:06,650 --> 00:13:11,060
see the progress of it but then the dash

315
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:13,610
W that's setting how long you should

316
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:19,880
wait between adding people and fishing

317
00:13:13,610 --> 00:13:22,850
them so that's 24 hours and this I'm not

318
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:24,560
done it's like yes so then you see you

319
00:13:22,850 --> 00:13:27,110
see it starting running in the browser

320
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:29,839
sorry in the terminal so it loads into

321
00:13:27,110 --> 00:13:31,670
Facebook it tries to add me on Facebook

322
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:33,410
it logs into LinkedIn

323
00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:35,839
add some people on LinkedIn so it

324
00:13:33,410 --> 00:13:37,370
connects with the one LinkedIn goes on

325
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:40,400
Twitter follow some people on Twitter

326
00:13:37,370 --> 00:13:42,770
goes on VK adds them as friends as well

327
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:46,760
and then it starts sleeping for the 24

328
00:13:42,770 --> 00:13:48,920
hours like we said after these 24 hours

329
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:51,950
you'd see similar output in the tool you

330
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:54,680
know sending the phishing messages yeah

331
00:13:51,950 --> 00:13:56,810
but but this is what you get so as a

332
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:59,150
social social attacker report at the end

333
00:13:56,810 --> 00:14:01,670
you get again like social mapper and Ice

334
00:13:59,150 --> 00:14:04,459
Age tml reports you can see what

335
00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:06,439
profiles the person has you can see what

336
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:08,690
phishing messages you sent to them and

337
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:11,360
you can see like the dynamic tracking

338
00:14:08,690 --> 00:14:14,210
IDs here have been you know so you can

339
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:16,220
see which which sites that they've

340
00:14:14,210 --> 00:14:18,020
clicked on you can see if they have

341
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:20,420
clicked on the link you can see the IP

342
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:21,949
address that the click has come from you

343
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:24,560
can see the timestamp of when they

344
00:14:21,950 --> 00:14:26,540
clicked on the link you can see if it

345
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:28,609
wasn't clicked or if the message wasn't

346
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:31,180
syncs they didn't have a profile and you

347
00:14:28,610 --> 00:14:33,860
can also see the browser agent that it

348
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:36,670
that the clip came from and this is

349
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:39,070
useful because if you start

350
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:42,300
you know looking at sorry doing some

351
00:14:39,070 --> 00:14:45,880
analyst analysis on the user agents and

352
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:47,829
comparing them to the timestamps you can

353
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:50,350
start seeing like oh is this person

354
00:14:47,830 --> 00:14:53,020
coming from a laptop during office hours

355
00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:55,000
and then you know are they clicking on

356
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:57,550
links from random people on social media

357
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:59,290
on my work machines or the work machines

358
00:14:57,550 --> 00:15:01,630
that we issue them so then you can start

359
00:14:59,290 --> 00:15:03,069
seeing if there is you know having these

360
00:15:01,630 --> 00:15:06,760
alternative vectors into your

361
00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:09,610
organization's so we talked about the

362
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:13,720
testing and what you can do so how do

363
00:15:09,610 --> 00:15:17,590
you protect yourself this is a white hat

364
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:19,990
conference so yeah defense is how can

365
00:15:17,590 --> 00:15:21,850
you protect yourself so some basic stuff

366
00:15:19,990 --> 00:15:23,860
you know if you're just looking out for

367
00:15:21,850 --> 00:15:25,750
yourself don't use the same name on

368
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:28,720
every one of your social media sites and

369
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:30,880
I use an alias on Twitter use you know

370
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:32,710
just your last initial and first name on

371
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:35,500
facebook and use your full name on

372
00:15:32,710 --> 00:15:37,390
LinkedIn or something like that you know

373
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:39,490
don't accept connection requests from

374
00:15:37,390 --> 00:15:41,170
people you don't know don't click on

375
00:15:39,490 --> 00:15:45,580
links from people you don't know like

376
00:15:41,170 --> 00:15:47,290
basic child hygiene you know and then if

377
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:50,650
you want to be super paranoid like

378
00:15:47,290 --> 00:15:52,270
myself turn use your face in your social

379
00:15:50,650 --> 00:15:54,069
media profile but you know you don't

380
00:15:52,270 --> 00:15:56,170
have to do this you can use you know

381
00:15:54,070 --> 00:15:58,960
picture of your pet dog or something in

382
00:15:56,170 --> 00:16:01,209
your profile picture and if social

383
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:03,100
mapper still links you to your pet dog

384
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:06,370
then you've got worse things to worry

385
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:07,600
about right so yeah protecting

386
00:16:06,370 --> 00:16:09,880
organization if you're looking after

387
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:12,640
your organization what can you do to

388
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:14,230
protect your employees run some social

389
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:17,010
media awareness testing like we've

390
00:16:14,230 --> 00:16:19,150
talked about at least run social mapper

391
00:16:17,010 --> 00:16:21,040
if you if you don't want to run social

392
00:16:19,150 --> 00:16:22,449
type of run social mapper and identify

393
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:24,219
everyone and say hey just so you know

394
00:16:22,450 --> 00:16:26,500
you're linked to our organization

395
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:28,840
through this type of reverse searching

396
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:31,090
and enumerate across the organization

397
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:33,160
and you know warn them about social

398
00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:35,740
media phishing it is on the rise it is

399
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:37,120
becoming bigger add it to your standard

400
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:38,650
phishing awareness trainings just add a

401
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:40,570
slide I'm sure you're already doing some

402
00:16:38,650 --> 00:16:42,670
stuff on email based phishing awareness

403
00:16:40,570 --> 00:16:45,670
just add an extra slide saying it could

404
00:16:42,670 --> 00:16:47,439
happen on social media too and I think

405
00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:49,439
the big one is asking your employees not

406
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:51,970
to link themselves to your link pins

407
00:16:49,439 --> 00:16:54,519
this is what this looks like is I'm sure

408
00:16:51,970 --> 00:16:57,399
you've all seen this on LinkedIn so for

409
00:16:54,519 --> 00:16:59,709
the BBC you can see they've got you know

410
00:16:57,399 --> 00:17:01,959
thirty-eight thousand employees linked

411
00:16:59,709 --> 00:17:03,670
to them on here and the reason this is

412
00:17:01,959 --> 00:17:05,019
bad is because who you click on that you

413
00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:07,449
can pull out as I've said before a

414
00:17:05,019 --> 00:17:09,370
thousand people you can do enumeration

415
00:17:07,449 --> 00:17:12,130
on a company so easily and pull out a

416
00:17:09,369 --> 00:17:15,250
target list and you know do use hunter

417
00:17:12,130 --> 00:17:18,510
area IO to find their email format and

418
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:22,898
then you've got thousand emails to fish

419
00:17:18,510 --> 00:17:24,279
so the reason people appear in the Indus

420
00:17:22,898 --> 00:17:25,809
River search and can be pulled out is

421
00:17:24,279 --> 00:17:29,590
because on their personal profiles

422
00:17:25,809 --> 00:17:31,750
they're linking the logo here into so to

423
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:33,549
the organization so I would just say you

424
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:36,610
know encourage your people to either you

425
00:17:33,549 --> 00:17:38,289
know be super confidential and details

426
00:17:36,610 --> 00:17:39,789
and where you're working or just don't

427
00:17:38,289 --> 00:17:43,710
link the logo here and then you won't

428
00:17:39,789 --> 00:17:43,710
appear in the reverse search and start

429
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:49,210
so you just finished off with some

430
00:17:46,510 --> 00:17:52,419
advice to social media sites you know we

431
00:17:49,210 --> 00:17:54,460
use in selenium and so you know a Python

432
00:17:52,419 --> 00:17:56,080
library to instrument the browser do

433
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:57,909
this automated scraping all these

434
00:17:56,080 --> 00:18:00,970
connections and things especially for

435
00:17:57,909 --> 00:18:03,970
facial mapping you know if if an account

436
00:18:00,970 --> 00:18:07,330
is you know doing a thousand searches

437
00:18:03,970 --> 00:18:09,130
overnight on Facebook at 30 seconds

438
00:18:07,330 --> 00:18:10,899
apart on each one maybe that's not a

439
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:13,480
legitimate person maybe that should be

440
00:18:10,899 --> 00:18:15,760
be banned and I've never had an account

441
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:17,110
banned for doing this so so maybe the

442
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:20,049
social media sites need to start doing

443
00:18:17,110 --> 00:18:22,090
some some work detecting that there I

444
00:18:20,049 --> 00:18:24,639
also think if you're going to be sending

445
00:18:22,090 --> 00:18:26,709
connection requests and we need to move

446
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:28,360
away from name based searches like it's

447
00:18:26,710 --> 00:18:29,919
really handy but it also sets the bar

448
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:33,399
really really low for sending a

449
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:35,260
connection request and and looking up

450
00:18:33,399 --> 00:18:37,178
people and finding them you know we can

451
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:38,230
move to a model like whatsapp or WeChat

452
00:18:37,179 --> 00:18:40,120
have where you have to have a phone

453
00:18:38,230 --> 00:18:42,220
number or you have to have someone's

454
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:43,689
email address before you can make that

455
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:48,039
connection request and it just adds an

456
00:18:43,690 --> 00:18:50,620
additional level of security so I do

457
00:18:48,039 --> 00:18:52,779
have to just pause here and you know

458
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:54,518
give us sure this camera like running

459
00:18:52,779 --> 00:18:56,470
these tools will break social media

460
00:18:54,519 --> 00:18:58,779
sites terms and conditions your accounts

461
00:18:56,470 --> 00:19:01,450
could be banned also targeting your

462
00:18:58,779 --> 00:19:03,070
employees private social media profiles

463
00:19:01,450 --> 00:19:04,960
is likely illegal and

464
00:19:03,070 --> 00:19:06,490
of countries check your local laws

465
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:08,620
before running this type of test

466
00:19:06,490 --> 00:19:10,299
I will inject here that I had a very

467
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:11,709
nice man walk up to me last night of the

468
00:19:10,299 --> 00:19:14,080
meet-and-greet and he was just asking

469
00:19:11,710 --> 00:19:18,220
and saying he had an internal social

470
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:19,809
media application internal to his

471
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:21,549
company and you know with with some

472
00:19:19,809 --> 00:19:23,860
small amounts of editing editing a few

473
00:19:21,549 --> 00:19:26,230
class names in the selenium tool you

474
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:27,939
could change social mapper sorry

475
00:19:26,230 --> 00:19:32,759
answered attacker to be able to run on

476
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:35,500
your engine in internal social media

477
00:19:32,759 --> 00:19:38,110
sites so and then I'll be perfectly

478
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:41,139
legal to test on and so you can do stuff

479
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:42,490
like that and obviously don't target

480
00:19:41,139 --> 00:19:47,019
organizations you don't have permission

481
00:19:42,490 --> 00:19:49,539
to target so just to wrap it up and

482
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:51,399
conclude I think is attack is we pivot

483
00:19:49,539 --> 00:19:52,480
to social media with their fishing it's

484
00:19:51,399 --> 00:19:55,570
really important for us to bring

485
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:57,159
awareness to this issue this will

486
00:19:55,570 --> 00:19:59,740
hopefully encourage social media sites

487
00:19:57,159 --> 00:20:02,620
to crack down detect and prevent

488
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:04,480
automated fishing and scraping also

489
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:06,689
hopefully prompt people to and

490
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:08,950
organizations to protect their profiles

491
00:20:06,690 --> 00:20:11,289
additionally I think we need to have a

492
00:20:08,950 --> 00:20:13,899
think about reviewing our laws and

493
00:20:11,289 --> 00:20:17,169
consider if they're impeding security

494
00:20:13,899 --> 00:20:19,268
testing you know attackers are

495
00:20:17,169 --> 00:20:21,429
increasingly pivoting to personal

496
00:20:19,269 --> 00:20:24,850
profiles and personal devices in order

497
00:20:21,429 --> 00:20:27,820
to attack organizations so should we

498
00:20:24,850 --> 00:20:30,009
change our laws so pen testers and red

499
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:32,980
teamers are allowed to properly emulate

500
00:20:30,009 --> 00:20:35,470
attacker techniques so we can test

501
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:37,899
awareness and educate people educate

502
00:20:35,470 --> 00:20:40,389
people on how to avoid issues such as

503
00:20:37,899 --> 00:20:42,039
social media based phishing or should we

504
00:20:40,389 --> 00:20:44,649
leave current privacy Prevention's in

505
00:20:42,039 --> 00:20:46,299
place at the risk of security I guess

506
00:20:44,649 --> 00:20:48,789
that comes down to the age-old issue of

507
00:20:46,299 --> 00:20:52,870
security versus privacy and I'll leave

508
00:20:48,789 --> 00:20:53,500
that up to you to decide on and that's

509
00:20:52,870 --> 00:20:57,428
it for me

510
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:58,840
so no sorry yeah so if you want to

511

contact me ask me any questions about

512
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:04,918

[Applause]

520
00:21:20,990 --> 00:21:26,490
now yeah does anyone have any questions

521
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:30,360
yeah I think there's a microphone

522
00:21:26,490 --> 00:21:40,280
something but I've been working on them

523
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:40,280
for like the last year and a half I know

524
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:46,168
any other questions yeah sir I think you

525
00:21:45,059 --> 00:21:49,460
meant to get to a microphone

526
00:21:46,169 --> 00:21:49,460
John okay to the microphone and ask

527
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:54,500
oh yes the question was you have to make

528
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,630
a fake to sign it to make the additional

529
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:58,400
crutch yes I wouldn't be sure your

530
00:21:56,630 --> 00:22:00,350
actual social media profiles the idea of

531
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:03,110
this testing like I said the accounts

532
00:22:00,350 --> 00:22:04,639
could could definitely be banned yeah

533
00:22:03,110 --> 00:22:07,189
you just make it it's really simple just

534
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:08,810
get a fake email address get a you know

535
00:22:07,190 --> 00:22:12,290
burner phone or something or make a fake

536
00:22:08,810 --> 00:22:14,419
account yeah any other questions one

537
00:22:12,290 --> 00:22:17,110
more in sooner yeah can I just tease you

538
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:19,580
out on one of your points so unlinking

539
00:22:17,110 --> 00:22:22,129
individual profiles from the company

540
00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:24,260
profile and linkedin is probably a bit

541
00:22:22,130 --> 00:22:26,330
of a bitter pill for us um can you just

542
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:29,080
expand why you feel that that's

543
00:22:26,330 --> 00:22:32,179
advisable in a little bit more detail

544
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:33,560
sorry it's actually worth coming through

545
00:22:32,180 --> 00:22:36,170
the bike rack could you just come out

546
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:55,070
and say so say a question just to be per

547
00:22:36,170 --> 00:22:57,560
se so ya know yeah so so there's lots of

548
00:22:55,070 --> 00:23:02,360
tools that do this there's a nice tool

549
00:22:57,560 --> 00:23:04,070
good attack service mapper and and

550
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:05,419
there's another tool called LinkedIn

551
00:23:04,070 --> 00:23:08,120
it's been doing it for a while basically

552
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:10,460
when you scrape all the employees off

553
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:12,949
you know you can you get credit you know

554
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:16,340
you're basically getting if you feed the

555
00:23:12,950 --> 00:23:18,470
first name and last name into into this

556
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:21,649
this way through this API called hunter

557
00:23:18,470 --> 00:23:23,600
IO and it tells you the email format for

558
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:25,100
the domains you know like I'm sure your

559
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:27,050
notes like what does your company use

560
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:28,429
like first initial last name or first

561
00:23:27,050 --> 00:23:30,379
initial dot last name something like

562
00:23:28,430 --> 00:23:32,150
that and then you start getting just

563
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:34,070
from the all the people on LinkedIn you

564
00:23:32,150 --> 00:23:35,720
start getting their their email

565
00:23:34,070 --> 00:23:38,470
addresses and then obviously shave off

566
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:40,490
the domain and then you're getting the

567
00:23:38,470 --> 00:23:43,190
images and then you're getting the user

568
00:23:40,490 --> 00:23:44,780
names and you know I've done penetration

569
00:23:43,190 --> 00:23:47,330
test where I've done that I use the user

570
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:49,280
names and I do like a password sprague

571
00:23:47,330 --> 00:23:51,230
you know and I get into one of those

572
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:52,280
thousand accounts using password one or

573
00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:53,630
something like that so that's why I

574
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:55,550
think it's important that you move away

575
00:23:53,630 --> 00:23:57,560
from linking yourself on LinkedIn

576
00:23:55,550 --> 00:23:58,250
because it's so easy to reverse search

577
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:59,810
the company

578
00:23:58,250 --> 00:24:02,030
pull out a thousand people pull out a

579
00:23:59,810 --> 00:24:03,210
thousand accounts so you know even not

580
00:24:02,030 --> 00:24:05,190
just for social

581
00:24:03,210 --> 00:24:06,870
fishing but you know network testing and

582
00:24:05,190 --> 00:24:09,809
in external testing and things as well

583
00:24:06,870 --> 00:24:36,570
it's just not good security practice in

584
00:24:09,809 --> 00:24:39,000
my opinion yes yes I'm from the UK right

585
00:24:36,570 --> 00:24:40,950
so so we're not allowed to test our

586
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,750
employees that's what I say I can't do

587
00:24:40,950 --> 00:24:44,399
this so I'm just open sourcing it to

588
00:24:42,750 --> 00:24:46,820
bringing awareness to the issue really

589
00:24:44,399 --> 00:24:50,070
right I said it's a proof of concept I

590
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:52,889
say so if I haven't you know actually

591
00:24:50,070 --> 00:24:57,299
done any testing like and give you

592
00:24:52,890 --> 00:24:58,860
verifiable data on yeah just awareness

593
00:24:57,299 --> 00:25:00,720
and you know things that I like I've

594
00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:02,039
said yo D you know unlink people from

595
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:05,220
LinkedIn and stuff I think really it's

596
00:25:02,039 --> 00:25:07,980
probably the the best of us that's cool

597
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:09,570
I think I've got 15 seconds but does

598
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:12,029
anyone else have any other questions or

599
00:25:09,570 --> 00:25:18,250
want to chat if you figure hand up I'll

600
00:25:12,029 --> 00:25:21,430
go to the Q&A room or cool it oh thanks

601
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:21,430
[Applause]
