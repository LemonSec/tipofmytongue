1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:08,370
good afternoon welcome to Islander AI

2
00:00:03,650 --> 00:00:11,280
last talk of the day you are here to see

3
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:14,250
reverse engineering whatsapp encryption

4
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:19,920
for chat manipulation and more with

5
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:21,590
Odette Vanunu and Roman zakian a couple

6
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:24,900
of housekeeping things before we start

7
00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:29,580
there is a welcome reception at 5:30

8
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:35,149
tonight on level 2 and also the pony

9
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:39,210
Awards in lagoon JK and L at 6:30 and

10
00:00:35,149 --> 00:00:50,190
without any further announcements here

11
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:53,550
are stars of the show one hello everyone

12
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:57,300
what's up how was your day good good so

13
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:59,339
my name is Oded this is Roman let's

14
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:01,319
start so today we will talk about

15
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:04,140
reverse engineer and what's up and we

16
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:08,150
will take you like behind the scene we

17
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:10,470
have here very nice life demo that we

18
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:14,220
will introduce to you and we'll do it

19
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:15,630
with you at the end of this talk and we

20
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:20,009
hope that everything will work if not

21
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:24,270
who will manage that so why we will talk

22
00:01:20,009 --> 00:01:26,580
about what's up so first of all let's

23
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:28,560
understand numbers like on everything in

24
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:31,619
life what's up

25
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:34,140
is not just an application what's up is

26
00:01:31,619 --> 00:01:38,329
an infrastructure it's an infrastructure

27
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:42,780
of more than 1.5 billion users more than

28
00:01:38,329 --> 00:01:46,439
56 billion messages per day more than 1

29
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:50,880
billion groups in this platform this is

30
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:53,189
huge infrastructure so in 2018 we

31
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:56,460
started to get intelligent and we

32
00:01:53,189 --> 00:02:00,539
started to get some kind of introduction

33
00:01:56,460 --> 00:02:05,520
or we saw some magazines that started to

34
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:08,910
report that whatsapp is a valid evidence

35
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:11,980
on court meaning that you can be charged

36
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:14,770
by judge if

37
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:16,869
they found you some kind of evidence on

38
00:02:14,770 --> 00:02:20,769
the social or instance messaging and

39
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:23,980
then we started to hear Jetson

40
00:02:20,769 --> 00:02:27,040
there were casualties by fake news that

41
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:29,109
was distributed by whatsapp and we all

42
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:31,989
remember after the election in the

43
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:35,590
United States about the hype of fake

44
00:02:31,989 --> 00:02:38,349
news and the impact of it so that was

45
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:42,970
our main incentive to start and to

46
00:02:38,349 --> 00:02:46,660
understand how this infrastructure

47
00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:51,970
itself so much people can be manipulated

48
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:54,489
and let's understand also the business

49
00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:57,549
logic of this application meaning that

50
00:02:54,489 --> 00:02:59,860
if all of you will shut down the phone

51
00:02:57,549 --> 00:03:02,440
for like two or three hours and then

52
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:05,970
open it I guess you will have dozens of

53
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:08,769
messages on whatsapp or any instant

54
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:12,250
messaging this means that the

55
00:03:08,769 --> 00:03:15,099
manipulation can be done easily because

56
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:17,170
you cannot track all the messages we are

57
00:03:15,099 --> 00:03:19,569
living in era that we are getting

58
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:23,290
instant messaging all the time all the

59
00:03:19,569 --> 00:03:25,660
time messaging message that was arrived

60
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:26,590
this morning or last night is not

61
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:29,319
relevant anymore

62
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:31,150
it's boring we are getting so much

63
00:03:29,319 --> 00:03:34,208
messages and this is why this is

64
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:37,000
infrastructure that can create fraud and

65
00:03:34,209 --> 00:03:39,510
manipulation so let's understand a

66
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:44,650
little bit about how what's up rockso

67
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:46,720
whatsapp web everything on what's up the

68
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:48,609
backend of well what's up is the phone

69
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:50,260
meaning that if the phone is not

70
00:03:48,609 --> 00:03:52,900
connected and you are walking with

71
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:55,780
whatsapp web nothing will work till the

72
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:58,900
phone will be active that is the only

73
00:03:55,780 --> 00:04:03,220
key to make sure everything in the flow

74
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:05,349
is working so what's up is using two

75
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:07,209
method for encryption and communication

76
00:04:05,349 --> 00:04:10,089
and let's discuss about it for

77
00:04:07,209 --> 00:04:12,760
encryption they are using open whisper

78
00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:15,790
system that's provided signal that there

79
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:18,668
started the project in 2014 and 2016

80
00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:23,800
they finished the integration into the

81
00:04:18,668 --> 00:04:25,448
platform and with the communication they

82
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:28,720
are using part of proto

83
00:04:25,449 --> 00:04:30,460
a Prada buff which is like Sarah

84
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:33,190
Dessen's structure it's mainly that it's

85
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:35,878
taking like XML JSON or any kind of data

86
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:39,009
structure and make it very fast and

87
00:04:35,879 --> 00:04:43,599
sufficient for for this application so

88
00:04:39,009 --> 00:04:49,599
the big question is someone can decrypt

89
00:04:43,599 --> 00:04:52,479
the traffic so the answer is no meaning

90
00:04:49,599 --> 00:04:56,229
that the end-to-end encryption is really

91
00:04:52,479 --> 00:05:01,719
working if I manage to sniff the

92
00:04:56,229 --> 00:05:08,229
communication not on one of the peers so

93
00:05:01,719 --> 00:05:11,770
I can't decrypt it but I can't start to

94
00:05:08,229 --> 00:05:15,669
manipulate the application if I'm

95
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:19,479
starting to play on my side meaning that

96
00:05:15,669 --> 00:05:22,659
the malicious user if we can decrypt his

97
00:05:19,479 --> 00:05:25,389
own connection then it can control the

98
00:05:22,659 --> 00:05:27,789
data of the application and then we will

99
00:05:25,389 --> 00:05:32,529
show you how it's been done and we'll go

100
00:05:27,789 --> 00:05:34,719
deep down into the protocols so how it

101
00:05:32,529 --> 00:05:41,110
began so first of all you are getting a

102
00:05:34,719 --> 00:05:43,750
QR code yep so this a QR code is

103
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:46,860
generating public and private keys this

104
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:50,440
is how the public and private keys are

105
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:54,400
looked like also what's up is using

106
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:58,379
elliptic curve cryptography it's it's a

107
00:05:54,400 --> 00:06:00,520
code and if there is no patent on this

108
00:05:58,379 --> 00:06:03,759
cryptography and if this one is

109
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:07,599
considered very very fast and it's like

110
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:12,099
based on the file one and and this is

111
00:06:07,599 --> 00:06:14,500
like the the library that makes all the

112
00:06:12,099 --> 00:06:19,449
encryption or the cube directory keys on

113
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:21,849
whatsapp platform this section is the

114
00:06:19,449 --> 00:06:24,190
beginning this is you at the beginning

115
00:06:21,849 --> 00:06:28,900
of using the private and the public keys

116
00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:31,840
to start the crypt and and and then what

117
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:35,830
we are saying is that we are seeing a

118
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:39,169
secret after the QR code will sync

119
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:41,029
secret of 144 bytes

120
00:06:39,169 --> 00:06:46,039
which is received on on the web sockets

121
00:06:41,029 --> 00:06:48,499
of the application and the secret is

122
00:06:46,039 --> 00:06:50,270
contains like encryption parameter to to

123
00:06:48,499 --> 00:06:53,210
help the decrypt their message

124
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:55,549
so now I went and over to Roman that we

125
00:06:53,210 --> 00:06:57,979
will a little bit enter to the self

126
00:06:55,550 --> 00:07:00,639
secret and the self search secret and

127
00:06:57,979 --> 00:07:04,300
how this all manipulation is working

128
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:08,389
thanks for that so hi everyone

129
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:10,729
so I want to websocket when we scan the

130
00:07:08,389 --> 00:07:14,360
QR code we will receive the secret which

131
00:07:10,729 --> 00:07:16,580
is 140 400 bytes this short secret

132
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:18,499
contains three parameters I will start

133
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:23,419
with the first one which is the shell

134
00:07:18,499 --> 00:07:26,839
secret so in order to get this a short

135
00:07:23,419 --> 00:07:29,270
secret we have to divide the parameter T

136
00:07:26,839 --> 00:07:31,249
which is the secret in this situation we

137
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:34,068
will divide it to two parameters here

138
00:07:31,249 --> 00:07:36,050
the end parameter is the first and refer

139
00:07:34,069 --> 00:07:38,719
to two bytes this is actually the shell

140
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:41,330
secret and we have the parameter a which

141
00:07:38,719 --> 00:07:45,199
is the data part of the secret then we

142
00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:47,899
will use the secret function on the

143
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:50,659
shell secret and the private key to

144
00:07:47,899 --> 00:07:53,089
perform extended to perform extract and

145
00:07:50,659 --> 00:08:00,949
expand function which will expand our

146
00:07:53,089 --> 00:08:03,710
share the secret to eight bytes 80 bytes

147
00:08:00,949 --> 00:08:06,229
only by using the edge gdf a function

148
00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:09,649
which is a simple H McKee driven

149
00:08:06,229 --> 00:08:11,599
function so this expenditure the secret

150
00:08:09,649 --> 00:08:15,979
contains the private key and the short

151
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:18,498
secret and this expenditure the secret

152
00:08:15,979 --> 00:08:22,279
also contains three parameters the first

153
00:08:18,499 --> 00:08:24,439
32 bytes is the a ski then we have the H

154
00:08:22,279 --> 00:08:26,629
mark of the expenditure secret and then

155
00:08:24,439 --> 00:08:30,770
we have another data part which I will

156
00:08:26,629 --> 00:08:31,699
explain in this presentation so let's

157
00:08:30,770 --> 00:08:35,448
start from the beginning

158
00:08:31,699 --> 00:08:38,690
when we will dive in the expenditure

159
00:08:35,448 --> 00:08:40,279
secret and divide it the first 32 bytes

160
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:42,440
will be the S key as I told you before

161
00:08:40,279 --> 00:08:44,660
the next 32 bytes will be the H mark

162
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:47,420
this is the H mark of the expenditure

163
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:49,910
secret and the last 16 bytes will be the

164
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:52,699
data part we also have another parameter

165
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:54,740
here which is s is the concrete in

166
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:58,820
between the shared secret and the data

167
00:08:54,740 --> 00:09:01,010
part of the real secret then we will

168
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:03,290
have to check the HVAC from the

169
00:09:01,010 --> 00:09:05,480
expenditure secret and to check if it's

170
00:09:03,290 --> 00:09:08,449
match to the explained to the H map from

171
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:10,610
the secret itself so in order to do that

172
00:09:08,450 --> 00:09:14,290
we will use the R parameter which is the

173
00:09:10,610 --> 00:09:17,770
H map from the expanded short secret and

174
00:09:14,290 --> 00:09:22,250
inserting the into the function H much

175
00:09:17,770 --> 00:09:24,260
sha-256 then we then we have to sign the

176
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:27,020
s parameter which is the shell secret

177
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:30,319
and the data part the result of these

178
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:33,680
functions will give us the parameter n

179
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:35,960
which is now the a computed H mark of

180
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:38,180
the expanded shared secret and we have

181
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:40,460
to compare that to the parameter R which

182
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:43,219
is the H mark of the secret so what's up

183
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:46,130
did all this cryptography in order to

184
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:49,640
verify the private key because as I told

185
00:09:46,130 --> 00:09:51,860
you before the expenditures secret it

186
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:54,140
was driven by the shell secret and the

187
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:58,280
private Kim so if during this process

188
00:09:54,140 --> 00:10:00,140
the private key change then those h mark

189
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:01,850
will be different and you will not be

190
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:03,080
able to proceed with the cryptography

191
00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:06,110
and get the actual key for the

192
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:08,180
conversation itself so this why what's a

193
00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:12,260
perform these functions so after we

194
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:15,560
check those h mach functions we will go

195
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:18,260
to the last cryptographic function here

196
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:20,930
it's the ASC bc decrypt this function

197
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:24,200
take the data part from the expenditure

198
00:10:20,930 --> 00:10:27,319
secret and concatenated to the data part

199
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:30,530
from the secret they need to use the AES

200
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:33,530
key from the expanded shell secret which

201
00:10:30,530 --> 00:10:35,569
is the first 32 bytes and decrypt the

202
00:10:33,530 --> 00:10:38,990
data part after we will decrypt in this

203
00:10:35,570 --> 00:10:40,910
data part we will receive the last keys

204
00:10:38,990 --> 00:10:43,340
we will receive the S key of the all

205
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:45,709
communication itself so we will use this

206
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:48,320
es key we will be able to decrypt the

207
00:10:45,710 --> 00:10:51,260
messages and we will have the H mark to

208
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:53,450
verify if the messages originated to us

209
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:58,189
or we received it by mistake somehow

210
00:10:53,450 --> 00:11:00,590
then we have to drop it so long story

211
00:10:58,190 --> 00:11:03,020
short first we have our parameters we

212
00:11:00,590 --> 00:11:05,120
have the secret it's 144 bytes

213
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:06,470
it contains the three parameters that I

214
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:08,900
told you before we have the price

215
00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:10,760
we have the public key we have the shell

216
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:14,120
secret the expenditure secret AES key

217
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:17,290
and H Marquis so first we took in the

218
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:20,500
private and public key from whatsapp web

219
00:11:17,290 --> 00:11:23,120
we put it inside the elliptic curve and

220
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:24,980
we initiated our private public key to

221
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:27,680
be the same as the public and private

222
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:29,450
key from whatsapp web and then we got

223
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:31,819
the shared secret from the secret

224
00:11:29,450 --> 00:11:35,810
parameter we expanded by using the H key

225
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:38,390
DF we check that the H mark from the

226
00:11:35,810 --> 00:11:40,640
expenditure secret is equal to the H

227
00:11:38,390 --> 00:11:42,650
mark from the secret parameter and then

228
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:44,180
we decrypted the data parts and we

229
00:11:42,650 --> 00:11:46,189
received the S key of the old

230
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:49,339
communication and now by using this a

231
00:11:46,190 --> 00:11:53,540
key we will be able to decrypt messages

232
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:56,770
so after we got all the parameters and

233
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:58,880
we decrypted the message we saw this

234
00:11:56,770 --> 00:12:01,100
structure as you can see here this is

235
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:03,620
actually the proto buff which I told you

236
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:06,560
before what's up sending the data it's

237
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:10,160
actually in protobuf that encrypted by

238
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:11,540
using AES which sent on the WebSocket so

239
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:14,600
there's the WebSocket decrypt the data

240
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:16,969
with AES and send Jason's inside

241
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:19,100
protobufs so in order to decrypt the

242
00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:20,690
protoboard on to decrypt it we just have

243
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:23,780
to do several eyes it right

244
00:12:20,690 --> 00:12:26,240
so we dive in what sub code and we try

245
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:28,270
to found them to us try to find where or

246
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:31,010
what sub declared their protocol and

247
00:12:28,270 --> 00:12:34,970
after we found it in the app file we

248
00:12:31,010 --> 00:12:37,010
created our own protocol file which look

249
00:12:34,970 --> 00:12:39,470
like this this is just the part of our

250
00:12:37,010 --> 00:12:42,640
file so by using this structure now we

251
00:12:39,470 --> 00:12:46,340
were able to do several eyes hey

252
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:49,430
protobuf and we and we got the JSON

253
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:51,290
so after we got this JSON we can see all

254
00:12:49,430 --> 00:12:55,819
the parameters that actually sent when

255
00:12:51,290 --> 00:12:57,620
you receive whatsapp message and from

256
00:12:55,820 --> 00:13:00,290
here we created our barbed suit

257
00:12:57,620 --> 00:13:02,480
extension by the government extension we

258
00:13:00,290 --> 00:13:06,800
were able to manipulate the message on

259
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:10,070
the fly so the key here was to break the

260
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:13,760
encryption and start to see the

261
00:13:10,070 --> 00:13:18,650
properties of the message now we can see

262
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:19,670
it unclear after we managed to crack or

263
00:13:18,650 --> 00:13:22,160
understand the

264
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:26,329
the encryption on the local side as I

265
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:28,550
said and and this allows us now to start

266
00:13:26,330 --> 00:13:32,990
manipulate the parameter on the fly and

267
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:35,740
start to see what's going on okay so

268
00:13:32,990 --> 00:13:38,300
after we created our bub suit extension

269
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:39,920
in order to use this extension first you

270
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:44,569
have to take the public and private key

271
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:46,280
from whatsapp web and and you have to

272
00:13:44,570 --> 00:13:47,810
take the secret from the web socket this

273
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:49,730
is the two parameters that you need in

274
00:13:47,810 --> 00:13:51,739
order to decrypt all the data right and

275
00:13:49,730 --> 00:13:54,290
because the secret is the initiator of

276
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:55,640
all those cryptographic functions the

277
00:13:54,290 --> 00:13:58,760
shared secret that every finger that I

278
00:13:55,640 --> 00:14:01,460
hear we told you before we inserted this

279
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:04,040
data in our tour that we created as you

280
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:05,570
can see the first line is the secret the

281
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:09,020
second line is the private key and the

282
00:14:05,570 --> 00:14:10,460
third one is the public him and by using

283
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:11,930
that we will be able to decrypt the

284
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:14,210
messages and this is how a message

285
00:14:11,930 --> 00:14:16,069
actually look like when you receive a

286
00:14:14,210 --> 00:14:18,440
message the beginning of the message is

287
00:14:16,070 --> 00:14:21,560
the message a reference item which is

288
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:23,330
stored inside the mobile SQLite database

289
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:25,849
and then you have a separator and then

290
00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:27,590
you have the encrypted data so if you

291
00:14:25,850 --> 00:14:30,350
take the data seized and move it to our

292
00:14:27,590 --> 00:14:33,170
a tool you will see all the JSON

293
00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:35,540
parameters which is the following one

294
00:14:33,170 --> 00:14:37,219
first you have the conversation the

295
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:39,589
conversation this is the actual content

296
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:40,880
which is sent if we will manipulate the

297
00:14:39,590 --> 00:14:43,280
code the content and change it to

298
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:45,410
something else and reply to it you will

299
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:48,199
actually spoke the message then you have

300
00:14:45,410 --> 00:14:49,010
the participant the participant is who

301
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:50,780
sent the message

302
00:14:49,010 --> 00:14:53,000
sure so if you will change the

303
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:55,100
participant it will appear like somebody

304
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,930
else sent the message then you have the

305
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:59,920
fromi parameter which is interesting if

306
00:14:56,930 --> 00:15:03,109
you own the personal chat with somebody

307
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:05,000
you don't have the participant er you

308
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:06,530
have just the remedy than the fromi

309
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:09,230
parameter so you actually what's up

310
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:11,120
don't really know who sent the data and

311
00:15:09,230 --> 00:15:13,100
it's look on it the from a parameter if

312
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:14,930
the from a parameter is true you send

313
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:17,450
the message inter from your parameter is

314
00:15:14,930 --> 00:15:18,979
false the guy you speaking with he sent

315
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:21,740
the message so you can speak to yourself

316
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:24,080
and just change the parameter from true

317
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:26,810
to false and will it will appear like

318
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:30,140
he's sending your messages legit yeah

319
00:15:26,810 --> 00:15:32,329
and you have the remedied the remedied

320
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:32,680
parameter is the group on the core the

321
00:15:32,330 --> 00:15:35,170
quant

322
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:37,029
you're sending the message to and

323
00:15:35,170 --> 00:15:39,339
another parameter of the last one this

324
00:15:37,029 --> 00:15:41,470
is the idea of the message he also if

325
00:15:39,339 --> 00:15:43,240
you will try to spoof from in messages

326
00:15:41,470 --> 00:15:44,980
and things like this you have to change

327
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:49,060
that because it's stored inside the

328
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:51,279
database of the mobile phone so this is

329
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:52,839
for the incoming traffic it's easy to

330
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:54,939
decrypt incoming traffic because you

331
00:15:52,839 --> 00:15:57,160
have the your own private key and you

332
00:15:54,940 --> 00:15:58,690
can decrypt the traffic but if you try

333
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:59,560
to decrypt traffic which is sent to

334
00:15:58,690 --> 00:16:01,930
somebody else

335
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:04,239
you actually can't decrypt it so if you

336
00:16:01,930 --> 00:16:06,609
will if you will Center that and catch

337
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:07,720
it inside your bar suit for example you

338
00:16:06,610 --> 00:16:09,370
will not be able to decrypt the data

339
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:13,029
because you don't have the private key

340
00:16:09,370 --> 00:16:15,130
of the originated of the person you're

341
00:16:13,029 --> 00:16:18,700
sending the message to so in order to

342
00:16:15,130 --> 00:16:20,709
decrypt outgoing traffic we had to catch

343
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:23,440
the protobuf a second before it goes

344
00:16:20,709 --> 00:16:25,119
inside the a CBC encrypt because after

345
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:27,880
the a CBC encrypt you will not be able

346
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:30,279
to decrypt it so once I get before you

347
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:32,830
can just grab the protobuf data this

348
00:16:30,279 --> 00:16:36,100
byte is actually the protobuf put it

349
00:16:32,830 --> 00:16:38,170
inside our key in the protocol format

350
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:40,240
and this is just a list and decrypt this

351
00:16:38,170 --> 00:16:42,910
data and again change all the

352
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:45,010
conversation participant the romaji the

353
00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:47,110
from e parameter and by changing those

354
00:16:45,010 --> 00:16:50,650
parameters you will affect action the

355
00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:54,010
actual chat so now we will go to demos

356
00:16:50,650 --> 00:16:57,130
yeah okay so we will do it quickly first

357
00:16:54,010 --> 00:17:00,130
like just and explain to you what we are

358
00:16:57,130 --> 00:17:02,980
going to do so there was we found like

359
00:17:00,130 --> 00:17:05,349
three manipulations and following the

360
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:09,010
research first manipulation is that you

361
00:17:05,349 --> 00:17:11,169
can do a fake reply from someone in the

362
00:17:09,010 --> 00:17:15,400
group like quoting someone and changes

363
00:17:11,170 --> 00:17:20,199
like data second is like a manipulation

364
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:22,480
on sorry the first one was in in one on

365
00:17:20,199 --> 00:17:25,780
one the second one was any group you can

366
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:30,640
fake someone that is not in the group

367
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:34,120
and you can also quote someone and

368
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:37,360
changes data the the third manipulation

369
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:41,709
that was fixed by a what's up by the way

370
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:46,090
was a cool one you could send in a group

371
00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:48,970
a specific message to one pair

372
00:17:46,090 --> 00:17:51,790
in a group and the peer will see that

373
00:17:48,970 --> 00:17:54,070
all the group is seeing it and once you

374
00:17:51,790 --> 00:17:57,270
will reply to it all the group will see

375
00:17:54,070 --> 00:18:02,409
everything so you can trigger close like

376
00:17:57,270 --> 00:18:05,860
easily and this is not so much

377
00:18:02,410 --> 00:18:08,880
interesting so now let's do the demo

378
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:16,120
live so be patient with us

379
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:20,650
it should walk easily so yeah so in the

380
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:31,659
demo we will create a story that someone

381
00:18:20,650 --> 00:18:35,740
killed Bob sponge and the trying to

382
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:43,480
manipulate and to blame Patrick which is

383
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:51,460
me so now we are in a group all of us no

384
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:57,430
internet no okay we will do that don't

385
00:18:51,460 --> 00:19:01,090
worry it will work okay and it's

386
00:18:57,430 --> 00:19:02,560
extended so you don't see it okay just

387
00:19:01,090 --> 00:19:07,000
yeah exactly

388
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:10,450
okay cool so when you're ready let me

389
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:16,120
know okay let's see that we don't lost

390
00:19:10,450 --> 00:19:26,500
the keys okay so this is my okay okay so

391
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:28,330
now we are manipulating and now they

392
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:31,960
will send me a message saying okay

393
00:19:28,330 --> 00:19:44,790
Patrick it is true you killed spongebob

394
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:47,260
and I will say no that's not me and then

395
00:19:44,790 --> 00:19:51,250
remember this message that I said it's

396
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:53,530
not me this message will manipulate and

397
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:57,170
you will see and now they will try to

398
00:19:53,530 --> 00:20:01,580
tell me okay please confess

399
00:19:57,170 --> 00:20:06,400
you you did at etc etcetera but it

400
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:06,399
really it was not me and then

401
00:20:13,290 --> 00:20:19,899
okay so what we will do now is that we

402
00:20:15,970 --> 00:20:23,890
will manipulate it the message to try to

403
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:26,890
blame me this is this is the end

404
00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:29,940
extension on the fly this is life we

405
00:20:26,890 --> 00:20:39,690
checking the data and now we will try to

406
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:39,690
decrypt it we change some parameters

407
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:45,000
encrypt it back decrypted back

408
00:20:54,340 --> 00:21:00,370
and then I still don't see the message

409
00:20:57,460 --> 00:21:02,770
and then go to there and then you will

410
00:21:00,370 --> 00:21:05,159
see in my phone on order phone that's

411
00:21:02,770 --> 00:21:10,379
Patrick go back

412
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:19,320
Patrick is actually saying here is me I

413
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:23,920
am sorry thank you well done or man

414
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:25,570
you're cool anyway so now think about on

415
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:30,520
the business logic of whatsapp that you

416
00:21:25,570 --> 00:21:34,330
get dozens of messages groups with

417
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:36,760
hundred people groups from school group

418
00:21:34,330 --> 00:21:38,590
from killing garden and and we didn't

419
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:41,170
show you like all the demos we can like

420
00:21:38,590 --> 00:21:42,730
now start to add like people that not in

421
00:21:41,170 --> 00:21:45,760
the group we can send messages from

422
00:21:42,730 --> 00:21:47,680
Donald Trump or from I don't know anyone

423
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:50,050
that we want that will enter to the

424
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:53,560
grouping and people will see it so think

425
00:21:50,050 --> 00:21:56,860
about like the integrity or if you see

426
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:58,240
this kind of messages it can like you

427
00:21:56,860 --> 00:21:59,709
don't know how to deal with that in

428
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:05,400
regular user don't know how to deal with

429
00:21:59,710 --> 00:22:08,440
that and as I said there were cases

430
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:10,510
around the world that fake news was

431
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:13,960
distributed manipulation was done there

432
00:22:10,510 --> 00:22:17,170
was casualties and and we decided to add

433
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:21,700
to research it and uncover and see if

434
00:22:17,170 --> 00:22:24,430
really this can be manipulated so we are

435
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:25,690
actually done and we are really really

436
00:22:24,430 --> 00:22:29,700
thank you for coming

437
00:22:25,690 --> 00:22:32,700
have a great day enjoy Vegas thank you

438
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:32,700
thanks
