1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,810
last talk of the day is detecting

2
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:08,750
malicious files with Yarra rules as they

3
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:11,780
traverse the network by David Byrne ah

4
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:11,780
thank you

5
00:00:13,309 --> 00:00:25,350
hi thank you very much thank you welcome

6
00:00:20,189 --> 00:00:27,480
to my talk so asked you mentioned this

7
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:29,460
talk will be about how to detect

8
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:33,180
malicious files with general rules as

9
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:34,710
they are traversing the network so a

10
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:37,980
little bit about myself

11
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:40,800
I'm a little security researcher of C

12
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:42,809
labs I have around 10 years of

13
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:45,269
experience in digital forensics and

14
00:00:42,809 --> 00:00:48,030
Incident Response I have 9 VX

15
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:51,809
certifications and I'm a sense mentor in

16
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:54,989
Latin America in addition to hunting for

17
00:00:51,809 --> 00:00:57,050
threats I really like to hunt for free

18
00:00:54,989 --> 00:00:59,940
public pianos that is one of my hobbies

19
00:00:57,050 --> 00:01:03,959
and I really love it so as you can see

20
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:06,509
that's me on a public piano in Paris and

21
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:10,110
I think that there should be more public

22
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:10,790
pianos in Las Vegas so back to hunting

23
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:13,860
for threads

24
00:01:10,790 --> 00:01:17,850
why are you Cure I want to help blue

25
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:20,939
teamers detect malicious files using

26
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:24,949
yellow rules and the seek framework and

27
00:01:20,939 --> 00:01:28,919
the good thing about it is that they are

28
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:30,780
open source projects so I also create it

29
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:34,470
like a custom script a custom Python

30
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:36,210
script that will be also available to

31
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:39,570
you so that you can enable this

32
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:43,798
capability on your networks on your

33
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:47,189
enterprises so what is yaara well gerrae

34
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:49,799
is a tool created by Victor Manuel

35
00:01:47,189 --> 00:01:54,169
Alvarez from your Stora and it can be

36
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:57,630
used to identify malware families

37
00:01:54,170 --> 00:02:00,930
malware samples and create descriptions

38
00:01:57,630 --> 00:02:04,710
for this malware families now the other

39
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:07,920
component is seek and we'll explain it

40
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:11,940
later here's a small sample of yellow

41
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:13,770
rule so we have three parts the first

42
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:16,079
part is that make

43
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:18,660
the data section in which we will add

44
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:22,010
information about the description of the

45
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:25,049
rule what can it do what can it identify

46
00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:27,840
also we can add some other information

47
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:31,920
such as the author and any licensing

48
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:34,440
restrictions that we have then the

49
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:38,820
second part is the string section in

50
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:41,840
which we can have string patterns also

51
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:45,120
binary patterns and regular expressions

52
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:47,250
based on the observations that we

53
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:51,540
identify on the malware that we are

54
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:54,120
analyzing so then we have the

55
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:56,760
conditional section in which we specify

56
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:59,130
the logical condition in which we are

57
00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:01,470
going to use those strings those regular

58
00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:03,750
expressions or binary patterns and we

59
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:08,280
can additionally specify some other

60
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:10,170
things such as file signatures so now

61
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:15,270
I'm going to show you a general rule

62
00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:18,480
that I created that I developed that is

63
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:21,959
used to detect Microsoft Word documents

64
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:25,950
that have strings related with automatic

65
00:03:21,959 --> 00:03:27,050
execution and that are very used in

66
00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:29,899
phishing attacks

67
00:03:27,050 --> 00:03:33,420
so here you can see that I specified

68
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:36,360
license and I added the description the

69
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:39,030
author name and then we have four

70
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:42,630
strings so the very first two strings

71
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:46,680
are related with automatic execution

72
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:50,670
they are functions within the VBA code

73
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:54,000
in the word document and basically the

74
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:57,000
auto open run scope whenever the

75
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:00,150
document is open and macros are enabled

76
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:03,060
and auto close runs code whenever the

77
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:05,370
document is closed and obviously the the

78
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:08,490
macro code is enabled and then the last

79
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:11,730
two strings are contained on documents

80
00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:14,520
that have macro code so now let's go to

81
00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:16,829
the final section and we can see that on

82
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:19,890
the very beginning I have conditions to

83
00:04:16,829 --> 00:04:23,580
identify the file signature of those

84
00:04:19,890 --> 00:04:26,039
files and on the second part I specify

85
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:27,530
the condition the logical condition in

86
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:30,380
which the strings are used

87
00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:33,469
so I want to verify that all the strings

88
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:37,490
related to macro are enabled are

89
00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:40,580
contained on that file and at least one

90
00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:44,600
string that identifies automatic

91
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:47,780
execution so I decided to show this rule

92
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:53,660
because it is going to be demonstrated

93
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:55,909
later on an attack that I have now the

94
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:57,110
other component SiC framework seek is

95
00:04:55,910 --> 00:05:00,320
very very powerful

96
00:04:57,110 --> 00:05:03,169
and it used to be known as bra and they

97
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:05,419
recently change its name so it can

98
00:05:03,169 --> 00:05:08,659
basically analyze the network traffic

99
00:05:05,419 --> 00:05:10,340
and create by default a lot of locks

100
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:14,750
that are going to provide a lot of

101
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:17,840
visibility to the environment so it

102
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:20,300
turns out that it can natively extract

103
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:22,760
files from the clear text protocols that

104
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:27,410
it observes but you have to enable that

105
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:29,390
functionality and seek so

106
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:32,000
gerrae has been traditionally used

107
00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:34,909
mainly on the endpoint to detect

108
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:37,370
malicious files but I noticed that

109
00:05:34,910 --> 00:05:41,090
whenever I wanted to attack Isis files

110
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:43,520
on the network I couldn't find a readily

111
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:45,890
available tool to do this so I found

112
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:48,440
that these two tools can be integrated

113
00:05:45,890 --> 00:05:52,760
very easily to enable that functionality

114
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:55,850
and their open source tools so you have

115
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:59,210
your typical enterprise network diagram

116
00:05:55,850 --> 00:06:03,650
and you have to decide where to place a

117
00:05:59,210 --> 00:06:06,799
spam port that could be on your course

118
00:06:03,650 --> 00:06:09,169
which then you send that spam port to

119
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:12,020
your six sensor and by default you will

120
00:06:09,169 --> 00:06:14,000
have your event-driven IDs logs created

121
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:16,099
by SiC but if you enable that

122
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:19,630
functionality for file extraction you'll

123
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:22,220
also have a lot of files to analyze then

124
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:25,969
you can enable that they are scanning on

125
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:28,040
the extracted files and you can send an

126
00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:31,610
alert to the security team that you have

127
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:34,220
so that they can take action on any

128
00:06:31,610 --> 00:06:37,010
detection that you have with your arrows

129
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:39,650
and by having the event-driven ideas

130
00:06:37,010 --> 00:06:42,979
logs you can enrich that alert

131
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:44,989
to better help the analysts decide if

132
00:06:42,979 --> 00:06:49,039
it's a false positive or a true positive

133
00:06:44,990 --> 00:06:51,530
and take action on that event so to

134
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:53,780
enable the for extraction and seek it is

135
00:06:51,530 --> 00:06:56,840
very easy you simply have to go to the

136
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:59,479
configuration file and enable a default

137
00:06:56,840 --> 00:07:02,109
file that it already has and it is

138
00:06:59,479 --> 00:07:05,000
basically the extractor all files

139
00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:10,790
directive you have to add that to your

140
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:13,160
main configuration file and then deploy

141
00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:16,000
the configuration again and that's it

142
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:19,070
it's going to extract all the files but

143
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:21,110
it also extract files from SSL

144
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:23,780
communications so you don't actually

145
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:27,740
have the content you only have details

146
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:30,020
about the SSL communication so another

147
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:33,680
approach would be to not extract every

148
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:36,560
file so only target very specific NIMH

149
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:39,620
types that are used commonly for malware

150
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:41,210
delivery so these will have the benefit

151
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:44,300
that files will be retained for longer

152
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:46,280
you will have increased performance but

153
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:48,770
it is a trade-off because if the

154
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:50,419
attacker is using a mid type that you

155
00:07:48,770 --> 00:07:55,070
are not extracting he could evade

156
00:07:50,419 --> 00:07:58,969
detection so here here are the files

157
00:07:55,070 --> 00:08:02,990
that you could extract are which are

158
00:07:58,970 --> 00:08:05,510
commonly used on malware delivery so I

159
00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:08,570
decided to extract compressed files

160
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:11,570
Microsoft Word documents PDF files RTF

161
00:08:08,570 --> 00:08:14,000
files and text files that could also

162
00:08:11,570 --> 00:08:18,229
allow you to detect some powershell

163
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:20,270
JavaScript VBS based attacks if you're

164
00:08:18,229 --> 00:08:22,400
interested on how to do this I also

165
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:24,500
wrote a white paper that will be

166
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:27,070
available on the black hat media server

167
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:29,870
and that will have the exact

168
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:32,779
configuration file that I use to extract

169
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:35,209
very specific meme types and as you can

170
00:08:32,779 --> 00:08:37,669
see it is very clear to understand how

171
00:08:35,208 --> 00:08:42,559
it works and you can easily extend it to

172
00:08:37,669 --> 00:08:46,339
add or remove any mean types so we'll

173
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:48,229
have our spam port we will send that to

174
00:08:46,339 --> 00:08:49,880
our six sensor and now that we have

175
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:51,670
configured the file extraction

176
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:54,550
functionality we

177
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:59,560
send those files to a specific folder of

178
00:08:54,550 --> 00:09:02,890
extracted files then we will have a cron

179
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:08,709
job that will run my custom Python

180
00:09:02,890 --> 00:09:11,500
script every minute and that custom

181
00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:13,570
script will take all the general rules

182
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:16,270
that are defined on a specific folder

183
00:09:13,570 --> 00:09:19,870
and will scan all the extracted files

184
00:09:16,270 --> 00:09:23,410
from seek with those rules and if there

185
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:26,500
is any match it will go to the sick

186
00:09:23,410 --> 00:09:28,569
locks and get additional contexts such

187
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:32,970
as the IP addresses that were involved

188
00:09:28,570 --> 00:09:37,300
at URL the domain name user agent and

189
00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:40,060
other fields and will copy those alerted

190
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:42,849
files to another folder so that they can

191
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:44,829
be retained for a longer period then it

192
00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:48,220
will send the analyst an email alert

193
00:09:44,830 --> 00:09:52,030
that will contain all the context and

194
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:54,790
after that it will remove all the files

195
00:09:52,030 --> 00:09:58,600
contain on the extracted files folder so

196
00:09:54,790 --> 00:10:00,880
that on the next minute the scan will be

197
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:02,650
much faster because we will only have to

198
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:07,000
scan the files that were extracted on

199
00:10:02,650 --> 00:10:10,270
that minute and then it repeats in my

200
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:12,100
experience I have been successful at

201
00:10:10,270 --> 00:10:14,620
running this script every minute but

202
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:17,650
obviously that will can change based on

203
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:20,230
how large your network is how many files

204
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:24,340
it sees so it can be configurable based

205
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:28,090
on your environments so what there are

206
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:31,030
rules to enable on your environment I

207
00:10:28,090 --> 00:10:35,290
think that every organization should

208
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:37,449
have a security team able to write the

209
00:10:35,290 --> 00:10:41,110
own general rules to identify any

210
00:10:37,450 --> 00:10:44,410
campaigns that they they spot on the

211
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:46,870
wire to identify malgor families but

212
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:50,199
also you have to use the resources from

213
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:53,140
the community so locally yellow rules

214
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:55,000
are available and there are many groups

215
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:58,390
that that provide very good quality

216
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:00,550
error rules such as your team sir teams

217
00:10:58,390 --> 00:11:03,010
all around the world we also have the

218
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:05,290
very talented Florian Roth who provides

219
00:11:03,010 --> 00:11:05,980
a lot of very good error rules so the

220
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:08,290
community

221
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:10,000
and we also have the generous project

222
00:11:08,290 --> 00:11:14,829
that provides air rules for free and

223
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:18,040
also public threat research that is

224
00:11:14,830 --> 00:11:19,750
provided by various security vendors on

225
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:21,699
their information about the threat that

226
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:24,280
they do they normally include indicators

227
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:27,160
of compromise but also they include a

228
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:29,650
section with general rules that detect

229
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:33,790
the artifacts of the campaign's that

230
00:11:29,650 --> 00:11:35,980
they analyze you also have some closed

231
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:40,420
threat research groups like the Jared

232
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:44,460
change community so to demonstrate this

233
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:47,920
capability I decided to focus on a very

234
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:50,620
prevalent threat attack vector that is

235
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:53,370
basically the Microsoft Word documents

236
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:56,620
with malicious code and as you can see

237
00:11:53,370 --> 00:12:03,120
this threat attack vector has been used

238
00:11:56,620 --> 00:12:07,780
for years and at least 2014 and the

239
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:10,900
latest example that I found was of the

240
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:13,420
last month right so and I think it's

241
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:16,030
still going to be used a lot so that is

242
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:20,260
why I decided to create a Jared we take

243
00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:22,480
this kind of files so basically this

244
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:25,120
threat of attack vector is normally used

245
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:27,010
on phishing emails and as you can see on

246
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:31,060
the screen here I'm using a proof of

247
00:12:27,010 --> 00:12:32,800
concept the server that I used to test

248
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:36,280
this kind of consulate functionality

249
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:39,310
this kind of detection capability so it

250
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:41,550
includes whatever lure to make the user

251
00:12:39,310 --> 00:12:46,300
click on the link and download an

252
00:12:41,550 --> 00:12:50,040
invoice so now I'm going to play this

253
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:50,040
demo for you to see how it works

254
00:12:53,590 --> 00:12:58,840
so they used user clicks on the link the

255
00:12:56,740 --> 00:13:01,720
file is downloaded the user opens the

256
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:06,310
file and while the user is reading this

257
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:10,300
document he sees that he has to enable

258
00:13:06,310 --> 00:13:14,469
the macro code and he proceeds enables

259
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:18,069
the macro and the code runs on his

260
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:20,529
machine boy but by this time six already

261
00:13:18,070 --> 00:13:23,710
extracted the file and I already scan it

262
00:13:20,529 --> 00:13:26,080
with Yara and sent the security analyst

263
00:13:23,710 --> 00:13:29,700
and alert an email alert which includes

264
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:33,130
all the information required to act and

265
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:36,130
do something about it so it is only a

266
00:13:33,130 --> 00:13:40,360
detection control the code is already

267
00:13:36,130 --> 00:13:43,620
running on the big team but it has not

268
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:47,080
passed a lot of time before that so as

269
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:49,510
you can see the analyst now has the

270
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:52,420
information and he can act and do

271
00:13:49,510 --> 00:13:55,089
something about it so now I am going to

272
00:13:52,420 --> 00:14:01,829
show you what details are contained on

273
00:13:55,089 --> 00:14:05,740
that email so the very first part is the

274
00:14:01,830 --> 00:14:09,070
general rules that were alerted so here

275
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:12,430
in this example I have two of my rules

276
00:14:09,070 --> 00:14:14,890
that I wrote triggered on this file but

277
00:14:12,430 --> 00:14:17,140
in addition to that I also have a rule

278
00:14:14,890 --> 00:14:21,880
of a trusted third party in this case

279
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:24,760
Florian Road that had a rule that also

280
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:28,120
detected this file so basically if we

281
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:34,089
have more detections or more general

282
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:35,710
rules it is higher confidence then we

283
00:14:34,089 --> 00:14:38,890
include details about the network

284
00:14:35,710 --> 00:14:40,750
communication if the file is very large

285
00:14:38,890 --> 00:14:45,790
and it cannot be added as an attachment

286
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:47,800
that to that email we place it we are

287
00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:50,860
basically the path where it will be

288
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:53,349
stored on the six sensor so the analyst

289
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:56,200
can go to that path and retrieve the

290
00:14:53,350 --> 00:15:00,089
file for additional analysis then we

291
00:14:56,200 --> 00:15:01,900
also have the IP address of the

292
00:15:00,089 --> 00:15:03,820
command-and-control server or the

293
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:06,640
delivery server that was used in this

294
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:07,329
attack and also the IP address of the

295
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:11,439
client

296
00:15:07,329 --> 00:15:15,339
clicked on the link and also the HTTP

297
00:15:11,439 --> 00:15:17,738
HTTP details such as you are I demand

298
00:15:15,339 --> 00:15:23,739
method in addition to other fields such

299
00:15:17,739 --> 00:15:25,779
as user agent we also include if the

300
00:15:23,739 --> 00:15:27,699
file is smaller than the Atrisco defined

301
00:15:25,779 --> 00:15:30,189
on the script we include it at as an

302
00:15:27,699 --> 00:15:33,128
attachment and it is protected with a

303
00:15:30,189 --> 00:15:35,589
password so basically we can move it to

304
00:15:33,129 --> 00:15:38,709
an isolated environment to an idle

305
00:15:35,589 --> 00:15:42,569
analyze it further and with this I

306
00:15:38,709 --> 00:15:46,359
conclude my demonstration and I want to

307
00:15:42,569 --> 00:15:49,689
end by talking about the challenges and

308
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:51,720
the next steps of this project well the

309
00:15:49,689 --> 00:15:57,189
greatest challenge is the fine-tuning

310
00:15:51,720 --> 00:16:00,040
because it can be initially hard to

311
00:15:57,189 --> 00:16:02,849
decide what you are used to enable from

312
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:05,618
third-party specially because you

313
00:16:02,850 --> 00:16:09,549
sometimes are not sure of the quality

314
00:16:05,619 --> 00:16:12,939
that they have so you have to test that

315
00:16:09,549 --> 00:16:15,489
and really make an effort on deciding

316
00:16:12,939 --> 00:16:18,329
what third-party rules to enable in

317
00:16:15,489 --> 00:16:21,910
addition to your own rules then it will

318
00:16:18,329 --> 00:16:23,769
also require some tuning to decide what

319
00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:25,209
meantimes to enable depending on how

320
00:16:23,769 --> 00:16:27,399
much traffic you see and your

321
00:16:25,209 --> 00:16:28,839
environment how big it is and if you

322
00:16:27,399 --> 00:16:32,910
decide to make it a very targeted

323
00:16:28,839 --> 00:16:36,879
extraction or maybe extract more files

324
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:39,069
now let's talk about the next steps on

325
00:16:36,879 --> 00:16:41,769
the next versions of this project I'm

326
00:16:39,069 --> 00:16:44,889
going to automatically create an event

327
00:16:41,769 --> 00:16:47,999
on the Miss p-- platform which is

328
00:16:44,889 --> 00:16:51,910
basically another open-source project

329
00:16:47,999 --> 00:16:56,120
created by the

330
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:59,209
look Sandberg sir team that is used on

331
00:16:56,120 --> 00:17:02,240
all the first community so basically a

332
00:16:59,209 --> 00:17:05,720
lot of computer emergency response teams

333
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:07,640
around the world use this tool and with

334
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:09,860
this I'm not only going to send an email

335
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:11,540
alert but also automatically create that

336
00:17:09,859 --> 00:17:13,729
event on our threat intelligence

337
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:16,938
platform so that we can share indicators

338
00:17:13,730 --> 00:17:19,790
rapidly with other security teams and

339
00:17:16,939 --> 00:17:23,679
also I'm going to send the alert to

340
00:17:19,790 --> 00:17:27,589
elasticsearch and syslog and have some

341
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:32,510
support for exclusions also exclude by

342
00:17:27,589 --> 00:17:35,149
domain URL IP address etc and see if

343
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:38,059
there is any support to integrate it

344
00:17:35,150 --> 00:17:40,940
with solutions that can open SSL traffic

345
00:17:38,059 --> 00:17:43,010
so right now I don't know if that would

346
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:45,160
be possible but for sure I'm going to

347
00:17:43,010 --> 00:17:48,169
test that

348
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:50,480
then I will migrate the Python script

349
00:17:48,169 --> 00:17:55,280
that I develop from version to version 3

350
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:57,549
and evaluate an integration with sandbox

351
00:17:55,280 --> 00:18:00,440
and sewer solutions

352
00:17:57,549 --> 00:18:03,730
feel free to download my script from

353
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:03,730
that resource

354
00:18:07,430 --> 00:18:12,740
and there's a white paper as I mentioned

355
00:18:10,310 --> 00:18:17,200
previously and it has more details on

356
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:21,980
how to enable file extraction and the

357
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:22,730
components of this solution so the key

358
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:26,270
takeaways

359
00:18:22,730 --> 00:18:29,060
gerrae detection can be implemented not

360
00:18:26,270 --> 00:18:32,540
only on the end point but on the network

361
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:35,300
as well network based Jerell detection

362
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:38,530
can be implemented with seek which is an

363
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:39,950
open source and free platform and

364
00:18:38,530 --> 00:18:43,010
network based

365
00:18:39,950 --> 00:18:47,060
gerrae detection is generally faster in

366
00:18:43,010 --> 00:18:49,340
my experience than scanning all the file

367
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:51,200
system of a specific endpoint which

368
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:54,470
normally stresses the endpoint and

369
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:57,140
causes performance issues in my

370
00:18:54,470 --> 00:19:01,600
experience scanning all the extracted

371
00:18:57,140 --> 00:19:05,300
files of on one minute is very very fast

372
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:09,560
obviously it can take longer on a larger

373
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:13,850
environment so finally I want to end

374
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:16,730
this presentation thinking to the open

375
00:19:13,850 --> 00:19:19,250
source products that I used and that are

376
00:19:16,730 --> 00:19:21,920
really great the stick project the yarra

377
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:25,700
project and also to the threat

378
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:29,180
researchers that share information with

379
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:31,370
the community so Victor Manuel Alvarez

380
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:33,260
Milla parkour and the direct change deep

381
00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:36,469
end research community florian growth

382
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:39,950
and year Stevens Bradford malware and

383
00:19:36,470 --> 00:19:42,530
traffic analysis net sense I see 13

384
00:19:39,950 --> 00:19:44,690
security vendors that decide to share

385
00:19:42,530 --> 00:19:47,720
general rules on the threat research

386
00:19:44,690 --> 00:19:50,720
papers that they do and release to the

387
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:54,230
public and with that I want to thank you

388
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:57,070
for coming here and listening to me do

389
00:19:54,230 --> 00:19:57,070
you have any questions

390
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:08,669
thank you thank you very much

391
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:08,669
[Applause]
