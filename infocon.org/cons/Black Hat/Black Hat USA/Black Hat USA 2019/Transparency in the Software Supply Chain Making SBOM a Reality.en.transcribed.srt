00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,859
welcome to transparency in the software

2
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:08,220
supply chain making as BOM a reality

3
00:00:04,859 --> 00:00:09,750
you're here with dr. Alan Friedman he

4

17
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:43,260
our speaker today dr. Alan Friedman

18
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:46,890
thank you

19
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:48,030
Thank You Angela thank you all for

20
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:49,829
coming out to the last session today

21
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:52,079
really appreciate it for those of you

22
00:00:49,829 --> 00:00:53,399
who don't know me on Alan I'm known as

23
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:56,309
the guy from the governor of the strange

24
00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:58,739
hair I used to be a computer scientist I

25
00:00:56,309 --> 00:01:00,570
wasn't a very good one so I got my PhD

26
00:00:58,739 --> 00:01:02,940
in public policy which means that I'm

27
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:04,769
also mediocre economist and a mediocre

28
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:06,420
computational model er when you're

29
00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:09,420
mediocre at that many different things

30
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:11,189
you tend to end up in Washington DC so

31
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:12,900
I've been working for the apartment of

32
00:01:11,189 --> 00:01:14,639
Commerce at NTIA for about four and a

33
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:17,130
half years and we're really excited

34
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:19,560
about this initiative because it's not

35
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:22,350
us we sort of catalyzed it but the work

36
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:25,590
is coming from the community some of you

37
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:30,560
I see here today so first basic question

38
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:31,729
who knows this logo someone shed it out

39
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:35,340
VxWorks

40
00:01:31,729 --> 00:01:38,280
raise your hand if you have vxworks on

41
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:40,140
your network somewhere everyone in the

42
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:43,110
room should have raised their hand this

43
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:44,130
stuff is in everything there were eleven

44
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:49,170
vulnerabilities that were announced last

45
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:52,140
week it is absolutely insane that we

46
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:54,450
have an ecosystem where we can't tell

47
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:58,469
whether we have something that might put

48
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:59,159
us at risk and where it is and so that's

49
00:01:58,469 --> 00:02:01,259
what this is about

50
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:03,270
now the problem being the last talk of

51
00:02:01,259 --> 00:02:05,130
the day is not only Drive to be more

52
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:06,839
interesting than your phone I have to be

53
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:10,530
more interesting than beer so we're

54
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:13,170
gonna try I'm gonna first revisit some

55
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:14,430
of the motivations why this is important

56
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:16,410
and say why aren't we already doing this

57
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:18,810
I'm gonna talk to you about some of the

58
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:21,480
progress that we've made so far as a

59
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:23,280
community and what comes next because my

60
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:25,619
goal at the end of this talk is to help

61
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:29,670
you appreciate one that this is coming

62
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:31,260
and two it will be much better if all of

63
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:35,489
you come and join us and make it a

64
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:37,380
reality sooner so some analogy you can't

65
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:38,610
go to the candy store and buy a piece of

66
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:41,100
candy without it coming with the list of

67
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:44,040
ingredients most of the time you don't

68
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:45,930
care right candy is delicious unless

69
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:48,299
there's someone in your life that has a

70
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:50,160
food allergy or sensitivity and then

71
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:52,140
it's really important that that

72
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:54,870
information is available in an

73
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:56,040
accessible format and it's not just the

74
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:59,550
consumer space this is how business

75
00:02:56,040 --> 00:03:02,549
works if you have a factory you get a

76
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:04,320
pallet load of chemicals each barrel

77
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:06,510
comes with what's called a safety data

78
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:09,420
sheet it's an iso standard that says hey

79
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:11,549
what happens if this spills and washes

80
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:13,950
over everyone's toes we have that

81
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:17,250
information available so that we can do

82
00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:19,619
business and in fact the term a bill of

83
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:22,230
materials comes straight out of industry

84
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:26,160
we've been using this concept for 80

85
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:29,850
years or more if you buy a 10 ton diesel

86
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:32,910
generator today it will come with a bill

87
00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:34,560
of materials a list of every nut in

88
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:36,269
every bolt why so that you can do

89
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:37,560
maintenance you can do operation you

90
00:03:36,269 --> 00:03:40,560
know what you're putting in your

91
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:42,900
business I also want to point out that

92
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:45,269
if you buy that 10 tonne generator today

93
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:49,709
it's probably going to be connected to

94
00:03:45,269 --> 00:03:52,019
the Internet and you have no idea what's

95
00:03:49,709 --> 00:03:53,610
in that software stack on a piece of

96
00:03:52,019 --> 00:03:56,910
something that's very important for your

97
00:03:53,610 --> 00:04:00,989
infrastructure so why aren't we doing

98
00:03:56,910 --> 00:04:03,090
this for software today well first we

99
00:04:00,989 --> 00:04:06,090
need to appreciate how these software

100
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:08,549
industry and the ecosystem is a little

101
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:11,340
different right it comes in a supply

102
00:04:08,549 --> 00:04:13,890
chain that is quite long and complex it

103
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:16,350
starts with small pieces of software and

104
00:04:13,890 --> 00:04:18,719
on remember left pad and then it slowly

105
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:20,489
gets combined and recombined and

106
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:22,140
recombined until smaller components

107
00:04:20,488 --> 00:04:23,880
become bigger components which become

108
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:26,550
products which then get folded into

109
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:29,250
other products we're talking about the

110
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:31,590
higher ecosystem here goes from open

111
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:32,580
source it includes dedsec ops it

112
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:34,229
includes the people who are making

113
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:36,628
things and the people who are running

114
00:04:34,229 --> 00:04:38,669
them in order to understand it we need

115
00:04:36,629 --> 00:04:40,169
to think about those perspectives I'll

116
00:04:38,669 --> 00:04:43,799
try to boil it down to three different

117
00:04:40,169 --> 00:04:45,990
perspectives on the supply chain many of

118
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:49,440
us produce software some of us buy

119
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:51,840
software most of us operate software and

120
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:54,479
it turns out that there are some

121
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:57,448
benefits for transparency for each of

122
00:04:54,479 --> 00:05:00,780
those perspectives so if you produce

123
00:04:57,449 --> 00:05:02,099
software first and foremost are there

124
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:04,080
vulnerabilities that you're shipping out

125
00:05:02,099 --> 00:05:06,060
the door but it's about more than that

126
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,719
it can help with cost it can help with

127
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:08,340
bloat

128
00:05:06,719 --> 00:05:10,909
it can help think about license

129
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:14,580
obligations you can communicate your

130
00:05:10,909 --> 00:05:18,000
good software practices downstream to

131
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:20,940
your consumer you buy software again

132
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:25,020
first and foremost is what I'm about to

133
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:27,389
put on my network vulnerable I can begin

134
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:29,430
to have more target analysis okay it's

135
00:05:27,389 --> 00:05:32,550
got this component do I care about it

136
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:35,159
hey is this particular component going

137
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:37,620
to be end-of-life soon how do I think

138
00:05:35,159 --> 00:05:40,259
about this as part of my broader risk

139
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:41,430
package and then of course they're the

140
00:05:40,259 --> 00:05:43,020
folks with the beepers who are

141
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:46,979
maintaining your software or running it

142
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:50,250
day by day for me this started with the

143
00:05:46,979 --> 00:05:52,620
fundamental question am i affected by

144
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:54,659
new vulnerabilities how do we make sure

145
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:57,629
that that information is available how

146
00:05:54,659 --> 00:05:59,460
do we have real-time data about that and

147
00:05:57,629 --> 00:06:01,560
by the way if there is a potential

148
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:04,008
vulnerability while you're waiting for

149
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:06,360
the vendor or the open source community

150
00:06:04,009 --> 00:06:09,180
if you know about it

151
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:12,300
then you can take other mitigations you

152
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:16,440
can protect yourself better so why

153
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:21,960
aren't we doing this today here's one

154
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:24,840
reason right licensing is incredibly

155
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:27,120
fraught and most of us who spend our

156
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:29,099
days in software and security really

157
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:30,150
don't like to think about it so we just

158
00:06:29,099 --> 00:06:33,180
use a little bit of this and a little

159
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:35,880
bit of that until a couple of years ago

160
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:37,469
I don't know how many of the largest

161
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:40,060
tech companies in the world could

162
00:06:37,469 --> 00:06:43,180
honestly say that they weren't ship

163
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:44,650
GPL code bought there's good news I

164
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:48,160
would argue that that is a much better

165
00:06:44,650 --> 00:06:49,780
understood risk today right every

166
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:52,030
corporate risk officer thinks about it

167
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:53,559
if you're in a start-up you're not going

168
00:06:52,030 --> 00:06:55,419
to think about exit until you've done a

169
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:57,580
license on it and there are lots of

170
00:06:55,420 --> 00:07:00,670
great tools that can help you with it

171
00:06:57,580 --> 00:07:03,880
today go to the floor and buy some the

172
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:05,770
other problem is it's hard I've talked

173
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:07,480
to some of the biggest tech companies in

174
00:07:05,770 --> 00:07:08,620
the world that are still struggling with

175
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:11,110
this question how do we put this on a

176
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:13,450
single pane of glass how do we actually

177
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:15,210
look at all of our different product

178
00:07:13,450 --> 00:07:18,760
families so we can have a shared vision

179
00:07:15,210 --> 00:07:21,330
part of the challenge is naming what's

180
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:21,330
this product

181
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:27,630
patchy web sir Apache web server 10 of

182
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:30,730
the biggest tech companies in the world

183
00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:32,530
did some internal dating turns out five

184
00:07:30,730 --> 00:07:35,620
different names for their internal

185
00:07:32,530 --> 00:07:37,179
systems it's not great if you're trying

186
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:39,400
to actually track it and get a computer

187
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:40,390
to do the work for you naming is a known

188
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:43,120
hard problem

189
00:07:40,390 --> 00:07:44,770
we've solved it exactly once in the

190
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:47,260
entire history the internet it's called

191
00:07:44,770 --> 00:07:50,409
DNS cost a couple of tens of millions of

192
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:52,630
dollars to run a year but I think

193
00:07:50,410 --> 00:07:55,900
fundamentally the real reason we're not

194
00:07:52,630 --> 00:07:58,630
doing it today is that no one's asking

195
00:07:55,900 --> 00:08:02,739
for it and because no one's asking for

196
00:07:58,630 --> 00:08:04,240
it no one's providing it now that to my

197
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:07,450
mediocre economist ears

198
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:10,300
sounds like a market failure and to my

199
00:08:07,450 --> 00:08:12,760
government ears that sounds like a job

200
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:16,120
for the government so how do we usually

201
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:18,760
solve problems in the government well we

202
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:21,030
can beat you into submission or we can

203
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:23,409
bribe you into doing the right thing now

204
00:08:21,030 --> 00:08:25,690
unfortunately or fortunately depending

205
00:08:23,410 --> 00:08:27,700
on how well you know me Congress didn't

206
00:08:25,690 --> 00:08:31,480
bother to give me any legal authority to

207
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:35,020
do anything really so I can't really get

208
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:37,780
anyone to do something but they also no

209
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:41,230
one gave me a budget or a staff so I

210
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:44,670
can't bribe you into doing anything so

211
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:47,170
what we have at NTIA is called the

212
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:49,630
multi-stakeholder model now if you roll

213
00:08:47,170 --> 00:08:52,439
your eyes at hearing it I'm the guy who

214
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:55,439
has to say it like ten times a day

215
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:57,810
but fundamentally it's I think a

216
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:59,970
genuinely powerful way of getting work

217
00:08:57,810 --> 00:09:02,430
done which is you bring the right people

218
00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:04,379
in the room and you say what will make

219
00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:07,469
this work how do we all come together

220
00:09:04,379 --> 00:09:09,029
the analogy I like is we got a bunch of

221
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:10,019
people that all want to get the pool no

222
00:09:09,029 --> 00:09:12,209
one wants to be the first one in the

223
00:09:10,019 --> 00:09:14,370
pool we can run around and shove

224
00:09:12,209 --> 00:09:17,399
children we can promise them ice cream

225
00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:20,550
or we can all hold hands and count to

226
00:09:17,399 --> 00:09:22,920
ten and get things done so I'm gonna be

227
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:26,430
very clear what we're not doing this is

228
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:30,500
the obligatory cya slide ah this is not

229
00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:33,300
about regulation NTIA is not a regulator

230
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:34,769
sometimes we fight regulators sometimes

231
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:36,959
we work nicely with them but in general

232
00:09:34,769 --> 00:09:38,399
not what we ought et is not source

233
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:40,800
cloade disclosure the Department of

234
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:42,689
Commerce is strongly against mandatory

235
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:44,939
source code disclosure and of course

236
00:09:42,689 --> 00:09:47,219
it's not standards development if you

237
00:09:44,939 --> 00:09:49,620
want to go with standards you go talk to

238
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:51,959
my friends at the Department of Commerce

239
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:53,339
at NIST they're just up the road for me

240
00:09:51,959 --> 00:09:56,219
they have a lot more money they do

241
00:09:53,339 --> 00:09:58,410
amazing work go talk to them what are we

242
00:09:56,220 --> 00:10:00,149
trying to solve here so first thing

243
00:09:58,410 --> 00:10:02,250
stakeholders did was they drafted a

244
00:10:00,149 --> 00:10:04,920
problem statement the wall of text

245
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:08,240
basically says supply chains are complex

246
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:11,810
we need to have composition awareness

247
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:13,759
thinking about risk and also cost

248
00:10:11,810 --> 00:10:16,709
everything we're talking about today

249
00:10:13,759 --> 00:10:21,360
ideally should translate to dollars and

250
00:10:16,709 --> 00:10:23,489
cents the overall goal is to harmonize

251
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:25,290
the existing efforts there's some of

252
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:27,630
this is happening already today in

253
00:10:25,290 --> 00:10:29,790
different pieces and parts we want to

254
00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:31,819
amplify what works and make it a routine

255
00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:34,259
make it more common make it accessible

256
00:10:31,819 --> 00:10:38,009
we want to be able to extend what works

257
00:10:34,259 --> 00:10:40,139
and ideally foster innovation so that

258
00:10:38,009 --> 00:10:42,240
next year or the year after some of you

259
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:44,189
guys have startups to help companies

260
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:46,829
deal with this data and generate this

261
00:10:44,189 --> 00:10:48,629
data in the past years since we've

262
00:10:46,829 --> 00:10:50,459
started this I announce this program

263
00:10:48,629 --> 00:10:53,160
last year blackhat we've made some real

264
00:10:50,459 --> 00:10:55,290
progress there's broad consensus on the

265
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:58,199
scope of the problem the need to say

266
00:10:55,290 --> 00:11:02,089
let's solve part of it first let's crawl

267
00:10:58,199 --> 00:11:05,380
walk run and let's focus on automation

268
00:11:02,089 --> 00:11:07,990
we have four working groups

269
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:08,790
they're not quite finished September 5th

270
00:11:07,990 --> 00:11:10,510
is when they're gonna have some

271
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:12,699
documents that are to be ready for a

272
00:11:10,510 --> 00:11:14,770
full-on public review basically and

273
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:17,020
think of this as the what the why the

274
00:11:14,770 --> 00:11:22,569
how and the screw it we're gonna do it

275
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:23,710
live so what is ns Bob turns out even

276
00:11:22,570 --> 00:11:26,290
though a lot of us came to the table

277
00:11:23,710 --> 00:11:28,360
with some good ideas once you actually

278
00:11:26,290 --> 00:11:30,370
try to be precise about what it is and

279
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:33,180
what it isn't takes a little work who

280
00:11:30,370 --> 00:11:36,640
knew Engineering's heart at its core

281
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:38,380
it's about a component of software what

282
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:39,880
is a component well it's a thing that

283
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:42,640
you got from someplace else that has a

284
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:44,830
name so how do we think about names well

285
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:47,650
there are a number of parts of a name I

286
00:11:44,830 --> 00:11:50,140
already mentioned that naming is hard we

287
00:11:47,650 --> 00:11:52,360
have the term sufficiently uniquely

288
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:54,850
identify the components so ideally

289
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:57,250
supplier component version a hash would

290
00:11:54,850 --> 00:11:59,140
be lovely it has the benefit of helping

291
00:11:57,250 --> 00:12:00,400
people know that by the way this piece

292
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:03,040
of software you got from an approved

293
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:05,439
repo you didn't go and download it from

294
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:09,730
some random sites that was using a

295
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:11,140
cloned backdoored version now we have

296
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:14,080
these components and they're in

297
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:15,130
relationships what is the most important

298
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:18,460
relationship where they're talking about

299
00:12:15,130 --> 00:12:20,500
X includes Y there are other

300
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:22,360
relationships that we can get into we

301
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:23,920
can talk about built on the standard we

302
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:25,360
can talk about compiled with but we're

303
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:28,180
gonna start with just the basic notion

304
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:30,880
includes that means that the software is

305
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:33,849
there so it's potentially putting you at

306
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:37,180
risk one of the real questions is how

307
00:12:33,850 --> 00:12:39,300
far down in the graph do we go ideally I

308
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:41,410
would love to go all the way down

309
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:42,910
someone once said to me I want to know

310
00:12:41,410 --> 00:12:45,760
everything that's in my product all the

311
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:48,939
way down to the sand lovely goal I don't

312
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:50,740
think we're gonna get there yet I think

313
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:53,560
the compromise approach if we're trying

314
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:55,450
to promote more rapid adoption is to

315
00:12:53,560 --> 00:13:00,430
have a recursive approach which is to

316
00:12:55,450 --> 00:13:03,460
say my obligation is twofold one I have

317
00:13:00,430 --> 00:13:06,819
to do report my top-line includes what

318
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:08,560
am I using I pass those down to my

319
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:13,900
customers further down the supply chain

320
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:16,000
and I also go upstream a hop and ask my

321
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:19,069
suppliers what are their top line

322
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,960
includes so that helps us have this

323
00:13:19,070 --> 00:13:23,240
this sort of more supply-chain

324
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:24,680
expressive approach not everything is

325
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:26,210
going to be available which means we

326
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:29,660
need to be able to be clear about

327
00:13:26,210 --> 00:13:32,900
opacity hey I'm using this component it

328
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:36,079
has all these great pieces and I'm also

329
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:38,449
using this component I have no idea

330
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:40,100
what's under the hood there okay that's

331
00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:42,530
a good start

332
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:44,960
that helps the person who is using your

333
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:46,760
software begin to make a risk decision

334
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:50,810
do they care about what's in that

335
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:54,380
component or not so that's the basics of

336
00:13:50,810 --> 00:13:55,939
what why should we do this well I've

337
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:58,580
already talked about some of the

338
00:13:55,940 --> 00:14:00,470
benefits this working group looked at a

339
00:13:58,580 --> 00:14:02,720
bunch of different use cases and really

340
00:14:00,470 --> 00:14:05,510
boiled it down to these three

341
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:07,730
perspectives and some benefits that can

342
00:14:05,510 --> 00:14:10,069
be conferred and again not all of those

343
00:14:07,730 --> 00:14:12,980
are about security a lot of those are

344
00:14:10,070 --> 00:14:14,630
about efficiency and by the way security

345
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:16,220
can be about efficiency if you can

346
00:14:14,630 --> 00:14:17,930
reduce your mean time to remediation

347
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:21,920
you've saved your company a lot of money

348
00:14:17,930 --> 00:14:24,770
but that data was actually built on some

349
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:27,140
interviews with real people if anyone

350
00:14:24,770 --> 00:14:28,579
says that they can't do it we've got

351
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:31,699
some evidence that people who are doing

352
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:33,640
this today maybe not completely but a

353
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:36,770
lot of people are thinking about this

354
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:39,980
but the benefit to all of us comes when

355
00:14:36,770 --> 00:14:43,699
a lot more of us work on this great so I

356
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:45,620
got the what you got the why so hey how

357
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:47,510
do we do it I've got 10 minutes left

358
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:49,190
we're not gonna put too much code up

359
00:14:47,510 --> 00:14:50,510
there what I want to remind you is one

360
00:14:49,190 --> 00:14:53,690
we're not a standards developing process

361
00:14:50,510 --> 00:14:55,130
the good news is there is at least one

362
00:14:53,690 --> 00:14:57,740
standard out there that will do this

363
00:14:55,130 --> 00:15:00,050
because as its core again it's about

364
00:14:57,740 --> 00:15:03,530
describing components and their

365
00:15:00,050 --> 00:15:04,790
relationships the bad news is that there

366
00:15:03,530 --> 00:15:07,250
are two standards out there that do this

367
00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:09,650
so you know always good to have one

368
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:11,240
we've got two one of them comes from

369
00:15:09,650 --> 00:15:13,340
Linux Foundation it's called the

370
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:15,680
software package data exchange it's

371
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:18,380
again built around licensing wasn't

372
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:20,750
built to s bomb can be used s bomb it's

373
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:23,720
extensible it's open source so it's a

374
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:27,400
continuing evolving project the second

375
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:30,740
one is called swig software ID tags

376
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:32,449
again built for licensing purposes meant

377
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:36,080
attracts software on day

378
00:15:32,450 --> 00:15:37,400
it's an ISO standard that's great unless

379
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:39,530
they're one of those people who thinks

380
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:41,540
that you shouldn't pay 970 Swiss francs

381
00:15:39,530 --> 00:15:42,020
for a document but there's good news in

382
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:44,120
there too

383
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:46,520
because there's a lot of information

384
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:48,560
including some published to buy my

385
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:51,260
affirmation friends at NIST that

386
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:55,459
describe exactly what a swig tag is it's

387
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:57,680
XML and what we've focused on is making

388
00:15:55,460 --> 00:16:00,110
sure that we can work with both of them

389
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:02,599
we're gonna be Canada right we're gonna

390
00:16:00,110 --> 00:16:03,650
be a bilingual society it's not the

391
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:06,110
government's job to pick winners and

392
00:16:03,650 --> 00:16:09,079
losers we're aware that in different

393
00:16:06,110 --> 00:16:11,750
regions people are going to use one or

394
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:13,370
the other but at the end of the day you

395
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:16,670
should be able to take software

396
00:16:13,370 --> 00:16:18,680
component data from one format and put

397
00:16:16,670 --> 00:16:20,719
it into the format of your choice so

398
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:23,500
that's really the goal so we've got the

399
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:26,240
what the why and the how

400
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:28,250
then there's the screw it we're gonna do

401
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:29,390
it live and our first meeting there were

402
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:32,960
some people who showed up to push back

403
00:16:29,390 --> 00:16:35,780
and said hey we don't think this is

404
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:38,030
possible and some folks in the medical

405
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:41,060
device community said no not only is

406
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:42,380
this possible but we need this yeah part

407
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:44,119
of the reason they needed it is because

408
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:49,010
their regulator told them that they kind

409
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:50,930
of had to do it but their regulator the

410
00:16:49,010 --> 00:16:53,180
FDA and they're wonderful by the way

411
00:16:50,930 --> 00:16:54,319
they are probably my favorite regulators

412
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:56,750
when it comes to cybersecurity the

413
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:59,990
entire US government Suzanne Schwartz

414
00:16:56,750 --> 00:17:02,570
and her team are wonderful but what they

415
00:16:59,990 --> 00:17:05,209
did is they pointed the entire sector to

416
00:17:02,570 --> 00:17:08,600
this ngi a process and say hey this

417
00:17:05,209 --> 00:17:11,570
shouldn't be a sector specific solution

418
00:17:08,599 --> 00:17:12,649
this should work with everyone so some

419
00:17:11,569 --> 00:17:15,409
of the biggest medical device

420
00:17:12,650 --> 00:17:18,530
manufacturers in the world Siemens

421
00:17:15,410 --> 00:17:19,550
Abbott Philips these are big companies

422
00:17:18,530 --> 00:17:21,349
that you've already heard have said

423
00:17:19,550 --> 00:17:22,760
we're going to work with some of the

424
00:17:21,349 --> 00:17:27,458
best hospitals in America

425
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:31,430
Mayo Cleveland Clinic Cleveland Clinic

426
00:17:27,459 --> 00:17:34,490
the and so they basically said let's do

427
00:17:31,430 --> 00:17:36,860
this now the good news is that they were

428
00:17:34,490 --> 00:17:38,900
able to do this they were able to

429
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:41,300
generate data from medical device

430
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:44,050
manufacturers send it to the hospitals

431
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:46,040
who were able to use that data to

432
00:17:44,050 --> 00:17:48,409
successfully complete pre

433
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:51,110
to find use cases around security around

434
00:17:48,410 --> 00:17:52,850
asset management around pre-purchase

435
00:17:51,110 --> 00:17:56,030
risk-based decision-making

436
00:17:52,850 --> 00:17:58,520
the bad news is that they weren't able

437
00:17:56,030 --> 00:18:00,680
to do it completely automatically and

438
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:02,389
that's okay because we're gonna have

439
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:04,100
Prague we're gonna make progress but

440
00:18:02,390 --> 00:18:06,440
this was their first attempt to just say

441
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:08,300
we're gonna try to do this without any

442
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:10,790
grand strategy and they were able to get

443
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:12,919
most of the way there so it's our job to

444
00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:16,190
carry the ball and move forward there's

445
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:18,260
still some open questions one of the big

446
00:18:16,190 --> 00:18:21,500
ones is what are the obstacles to

447
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:24,460
finding this data in some ecosystems

448
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:27,410
it's going to be pretty easy to identify

449
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:29,720
what your components are if your

450
00:18:27,410 --> 00:18:31,970
development world has the word package

451
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:32,750
manager in it you're probably going to

452
00:18:31,970 --> 00:18:35,840
be okay

453
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:38,030
that stuff's there in other areas where

454
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:40,480
the software is a lot more diffuse from

455
00:18:38,030 --> 00:18:43,190
many more different communities than

456
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:46,430
solving these issues of making sure that

457
00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:47,960
there's enough metadata to produce the

458
00:18:46,430 --> 00:18:49,670
data that's that's valuable to ship

459
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:51,800
downstream it's gonna be a little bit of

460
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:55,100
a challenge we need to better understand

461
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:57,800
and map that problem space what does the

462
00:18:55,100 --> 00:19:00,100
act of transparency look like so we're

463
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:03,169
generating the data we're using the data

464
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:05,810
how do we connect the two well some

465
00:19:03,170 --> 00:19:08,840
cases pretty straightforward a swim tag

466
00:19:05,810 --> 00:19:11,360
is a metadata that actually follows the

467
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:14,510
binary so whenever your code changes

468
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:16,010
your s bond changes pretty easy probably

469
00:19:14,510 --> 00:19:18,470
doesn't work that well for an embedded

470
00:19:16,010 --> 00:19:19,850
device especially one that you don't

471
00:19:18,470 --> 00:19:21,620
want a whole bunch of scanning tools

472
00:19:19,850 --> 00:19:24,830
running on that network so we need to

473
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:26,899
find some further solutions I'm not

474
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:29,840
personally wild about sort of having

475
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:30,920
little domains of centralization but

476
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:32,570
I've heard from a couple of sectors

477
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:34,190
they're like oh yeah actually we can

478
00:19:32,570 --> 00:19:36,200
imagine that we could have a trusted

479
00:19:34,190 --> 00:19:38,000
party hold this data for us so we can

480
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:38,840
manage it for our sector that's gonna be

481
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,600
something that we're gonna have to sort

482
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:43,580
out together perhaps one of the biggest

483
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:45,399
challenges is this question of

484
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:48,169
vulnerability versus exploitability

485
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:51,530
depending on how you measure it there

486
00:19:48,170 --> 00:19:54,260
are between 600 and a thousand function

487
00:19:51,530 --> 00:19:57,899
calls you can make in open SSL version

488
00:19:54,260 --> 00:20:00,060
old old two of them

489
00:19:57,900 --> 00:20:03,410
heartbleed Obul right it's a big ass

490
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:06,030
library so how do you communicate

491
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:09,180
downstream that yes we know this is

492
00:20:06,030 --> 00:20:11,850
going to set off a dashboard tool but

493
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:13,890
this is a very low priority this is

494
00:20:11,850 --> 00:20:14,939
going to actually because we're going to

495
00:20:13,890 --> 00:20:17,430
have a whole bunch of people more aware

496
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:18,810
of risk especially in the short run

497
00:20:17,430 --> 00:20:21,060
we're going to have to learn how to

498
00:20:18,810 --> 00:20:23,879
prioritize and that's a require effort

499
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:27,090
on both parts this is about enabling a

500
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:30,600
discussion of risk what are the next

501
00:20:27,090 --> 00:20:34,080
steps we're having a meeting

502
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:37,230
in Washington DC on September 5th the

503
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:40,500
working groups have been informed with

504
00:20:37,230 --> 00:20:42,030
my absolutely zero authority that they

505
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:45,480
need to have some drafts ready by then

506
00:20:42,030 --> 00:20:48,060
again the what the why the how and the

507
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:49,500
review of how people just tried to do it

508
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:53,129
on a whim and what their lessons learned

509
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:55,950
war were the next steps are really where

510
00:20:53,130 --> 00:20:58,890
it starts to gain traction because this

511
00:20:55,950 --> 00:21:00,930
was just the base layer to make progress

512
00:20:58,890 --> 00:21:02,780
we need to think about how do we extend

513
00:21:00,930 --> 00:21:04,820
this model to capture more use cases

514
00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:08,820
especially for higher assurance areas

515
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:11,760
Telkom national security more critically

516
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:13,590
regulated spaces how do we make sure

517
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:15,900
that there are tools that allow all of

518
00:21:13,590 --> 00:21:17,159
us to do this as we need to so that's

519
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:19,500
gonna be collecting the ones from open

520
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:21,660
source and starting to talk to

521
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:23,730
commercial vendors to say what could you

522
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:25,590
do with this data how could you help

523
00:21:23,730 --> 00:21:28,290
your customers if this data was

524
00:21:25,590 --> 00:21:30,750
available and perhaps the most important

525
00:21:28,290 --> 00:21:32,760
approach you're already doing which is

526
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:35,280
you're listening and you're gonna tell

527
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:37,050
more people about this this isn't an

528
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:38,940
American initiative this is a global

529
00:21:37,050 --> 00:21:40,080
initiative we're working with the

530
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:43,650
English we're working the Dutch were

531
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:45,510
working the Japanese this isn't a sector

532
00:21:43,650 --> 00:21:46,890
specific initiative there are gonna be

533
00:21:45,510 --> 00:21:50,400
certain sectors that you take the lead

534
00:21:46,890 --> 00:21:54,660
and that's okay but I would argue that

535
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:56,490
all of us need this transparency supply

536
00:21:54,660 --> 00:21:59,310
chain risk is one of those magic words

537
00:21:56,490 --> 00:22:01,230
that everyone's talking about so there's

538
00:21:59,310 --> 00:22:03,570
no perfect solution it's going to

539
00:22:01,230 --> 00:22:06,210
require a lot of work some of it from

540
00:22:03,570 --> 00:22:08,580
the government most of it from you but I

541
00:22:06,210 --> 00:22:11,280
would argue that transparency is the

542
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:12,570
base layer that almost

543
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:15,210
all of those solutions are going to

544
00:22:12,570 --> 00:22:25,260
build on so I'm hoping that you can help

545
00:22:15,210 --> 00:22:26,910
us thank you been asked to remind you

546
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:29,610
that if you would like to yell at me and

547
00:22:26,910 --> 00:22:36,870
use insults please use the mics in the

548
00:22:29,610 --> 00:22:38,340
aisles I would also remind you that

549
00:22:36,870 --> 00:22:40,409
there's beer if you just want to chat

550
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:43,860
elsewhere here's how to get in touch

551
00:22:40,410 --> 00:22:45,690
with me I say that I am more than happy

552
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:48,270
if you or your team are interested after

553
00:22:45,690 --> 00:22:50,490
DEFCON we will schedule a call I'll

554
00:22:48,270 --> 00:22:52,740
brief your entire team this is my job

555
00:22:50,490 --> 00:22:54,000
I want to hear feedback from you and I

556
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:56,730
want to catch you up to speed so you can

557
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:59,040
get involved yes I just got a quick

558
00:22:56,730 --> 00:23:00,770
question you know I'm wondering what

559
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:03,379
your thoughts have been thus far on how

560
00:23:00,770 --> 00:23:06,330
some of this plays through to cloud

561
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:07,830
because when I look at you know the swig

562
00:23:06,330 --> 00:23:09,389
tags format and some of the existing

563
00:23:07,830 --> 00:23:12,540
formats and I try to figure out how I

564
00:23:09,390 --> 00:23:13,710
would put a lambda function in there you

565
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:15,270
know I'm just wondering what your

566
00:23:13,710 --> 00:23:17,910
thoughts I think it seems like some of

567
00:23:15,270 --> 00:23:20,490
the some of the things that we're doing

568
00:23:17,910 --> 00:23:22,890
with cloud may need to be rethought with

569
00:23:20,490 --> 00:23:24,990
this III agree completely so there are a

570
00:23:22,890 --> 00:23:27,300
couple of approaches one is if you're

571
00:23:24,990 --> 00:23:30,060
just doing ordinary apps SEC there's a

572
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:31,500
huge value in this right be able to

573
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:33,480
track what components you're using

574
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:34,890
enables white lists black lists all that

575
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:37,830
lovely stuff so really helpful on the

576
00:23:34,890 --> 00:23:39,570
dev side on the risks side I agree with

577
00:23:37,830 --> 00:23:41,220
you completely I've started to have some

578
00:23:39,570 --> 00:23:42,720
discussions with the Cloud Security

579
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:44,250
Alliance if anyone else is interested I

580
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:45,420
actually just reached out to someone on

581
00:23:44,250 --> 00:23:49,230
Twitter who's been doing some work on

582
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:52,050
cloud audit because on one hand if we're

583
00:23:49,230 --> 00:23:54,600
talking about a risk discussion well for

584
00:23:52,050 --> 00:23:57,149
some of the sass stuff what I'm using a

585
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:58,740
big company they're bearing all the risk

586
00:23:57,150 --> 00:24:00,660
there's nothing they can tell me that

587
00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:02,700
would change my risk calculation beyond

588
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:07,050
the initial vendor discussion on the

589
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:09,150
other end let's imagine you have you

590
00:24:07,050 --> 00:24:11,820
bought a terrible outdated app the whole

591
00:24:09,150 --> 00:24:14,760
thing just built on utter trash see you

592
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:17,159
laugh the thing 8 ways from Sunday but

593
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:18,780
the whole thing's built on struts what

594
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:21,570
is information that you need to tell me

595
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:22,950
that wouldn't help me make a decision we

596
00:24:21,570 --> 00:24:24,549
need to talk through not just the depth

597
00:24:22,950 --> 00:24:26,619
of the software

598
00:24:24,549 --> 00:24:30,158
but the whole stack and then finally of

599
00:24:26,619 --> 00:24:32,320
course there's containers and then that

600
00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:35,830
is both important but also a whole

601
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:37,928
nother dimension so have you seen

602
00:24:35,830 --> 00:24:39,428
anything you said there is maybe not so

603
00:24:37,929 --> 00:24:41,169
much a market needed but we've actually

604
00:24:39,429 --> 00:24:44,440
started to see it come up in

605
00:24:41,169 --> 00:24:45,820
procurements and kind of approaching it

606
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:47,950
from that perspective and so we're

607
00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:49,479
actually asking folks right where

608
00:24:47,950 --> 00:24:52,450
National Laboratories so we're asking

609
00:24:49,479 --> 00:24:53,919
folks what is actually in this right so

610
00:24:52,450 --> 00:24:55,539
have you used what is your kind of

611
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:57,489
perspective on that are you seeing a lot

612
00:24:55,539 --> 00:24:59,739
of that completely so I'll tell you two

613
00:24:57,489 --> 00:25:03,129
stories one well the largest banks in

614
00:24:59,739 --> 00:25:05,859
America asks for this today they don't

615
00:25:03,129 --> 00:25:07,208
care how you give it to them you can fax

616
00:25:05,859 --> 00:25:09,070
it to them and by the way if you're

617
00:25:07,209 --> 00:25:12,190
doing it in PDF you're doing it wrong

618
00:25:09,070 --> 00:25:14,649
but they just want to know if you can

619
00:25:12,190 --> 00:25:17,159
generate this because in their

620
00:25:14,649 --> 00:25:21,488
experience if you can't generate it

621
00:25:17,159 --> 00:25:23,950
their costs of maintaining your software

622
00:25:21,489 --> 00:25:26,799
or expect to be much higher so they will

623
00:25:23,950 --> 00:25:29,739
ask for five to ten percent price

624
00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:31,209
reduction off the top that's net imagine

625
00:25:29,739 --> 00:25:33,729
your sales engineer you just find out

626
00:25:31,209 --> 00:25:35,529
that you get 10% less total on your

627
00:25:33,729 --> 00:25:36,820
contract just because the dev people

628
00:25:35,529 --> 00:25:38,589
can't keep track of what they're using

629
00:25:36,820 --> 00:25:41,259
so that's one story where it's a dollars

630
00:25:38,589 --> 00:25:44,739
and cents approach but I'll give you an

631
00:25:41,259 --> 00:25:48,639
example from the Mayo Clinic they're

632
00:25:44,739 --> 00:25:50,499
also asking for this today doctors say I

633
00:25:48,639 --> 00:25:51,939
need this fancy new piece of technology

634
00:25:50,499 --> 00:25:55,419
that's going to help me save lives

635
00:25:51,940 --> 00:25:58,239
the security team today they can't block

636
00:25:55,419 --> 00:26:01,209
the acquisition but they can ask a lot

637
00:25:58,239 --> 00:26:02,709
of hard questions because they need to

638
00:26:01,209 --> 00:26:05,440
have a plan for when they put it on

639
00:26:02,709 --> 00:26:07,839
their network and that's not a short

640
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:09,249
conversation how many people like their

641
00:26:07,839 --> 00:26:11,559
salespeople when they find out that

642
00:26:09,249 --> 00:26:13,509
their sales is going to be delayed 1/4

643
00:26:11,559 --> 00:26:17,499
2/4 3/4 well they have that discussion

644
00:26:13,509 --> 00:26:19,749
so we are slowly working on it today and

645
00:26:17,499 --> 00:26:21,549
it's an evolutionary process because not

646
00:26:19,749 --> 00:26:23,200
everyone can develop this stuff today

647
00:26:21,549 --> 00:26:29,709
I'd love to talk more about what you're

648
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:33,279
doing sandhya yes so earlier you

649
00:26:29,709 --> 00:26:34,750
mentioned that one of the dilemmas was

650
00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:38,920
how

651
00:26:34,750 --> 00:26:40,840
do you go in in terms of detail and then

652
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:42,670
you're mentioning that you're gonna do

653
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:44,830
try to set up a baseline which sounds

654
00:26:42,670 --> 00:26:49,060
like it's kind of like a framework right

655
00:26:44,830 --> 00:26:51,250
for everybody have have you done any

656
00:26:49,060 --> 00:26:53,649
sort of assessments or anything on you

657
00:26:51,250 --> 00:26:55,750
know just how much value is gonna be

658
00:26:53,650 --> 00:26:58,120
provided at if you're stuck at a higher

659
00:26:55,750 --> 00:26:59,920
level of the architecture and that's it

660
00:26:58,120 --> 00:27:02,169
you can't go any deeper I mean I'm not

661
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:05,110
sure if you don't you know have enough

662
00:27:02,170 --> 00:27:07,090
granularity how valuable you know this

663
00:27:05,110 --> 00:27:09,280
tool could be that is a huge question

664
00:27:07,090 --> 00:27:11,889
I've had a lot of discussions with

665
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:15,370
people about that often with glasses in

666
00:27:11,890 --> 00:27:18,280
my hands I haven't seen really good

667
00:27:15,370 --> 00:27:19,449
science because again every supply chain

668
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:21,520
is a little different depending on what

669
00:27:19,450 --> 00:27:26,650
corner I will say that for things like

670
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:27,879
devices operating system is so much more

671
00:27:26,650 --> 00:27:29,860
important than the things that are lower

672
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:31,870
so one thing that I'm starting to talk

673
00:27:29,860 --> 00:27:32,560
to are some of the people like Kenna

674
00:27:31,870 --> 00:27:34,389
where they're looking

675
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:36,460
what is actively being exploited and

676
00:27:34,390 --> 00:27:40,090
that can start to give us some guidance

677
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:41,890
I might my suspicion is that as we go

678
00:27:40,090 --> 00:27:44,080
down there's diminishing return but I

679
00:27:41,890 --> 00:27:45,280
don't think it's a steep drop-off I

680
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:45,790
think it's more of a drag gradual

681
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:47,530
drop-off

682
00:27:45,790 --> 00:27:50,350
if there any data science people here

683
00:27:47,530 --> 00:27:54,310
would love the chat I may have time for

684
00:27:50,350 --> 00:27:57,340
a super quick question then I'll ask it

685
00:27:54,310 --> 00:27:58,990
why do you see FDA and subsequently med

686
00:27:57,340 --> 00:28:01,209
device is the first industry that's

687
00:27:58,990 --> 00:28:04,360
actually you know spearheaded some

688
00:28:01,210 --> 00:28:07,420
progress here so this is a fun story of

689
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:09,639
how do we explain public policy and it's

690
00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:11,710
a couple of things agenda setting is a

691
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:14,500
whole field of political science more

692
00:28:11,710 --> 00:28:16,510
beer for that one the I think the real

693
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:19,120
thing are twofold one there was a

694
00:28:16,510 --> 00:28:21,430
particularly active security researcher

695
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:23,800
who was involved in a congressional task

696
00:28:21,430 --> 00:28:25,150
force Josh Corman some of you Nolan was

697
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:28,629
involved in a congressional task force

698
00:28:25,150 --> 00:28:30,310
that made a report to HHS which is the

699
00:28:28,630 --> 00:28:32,500
government agency the cabinet level

700
00:28:30,310 --> 00:28:34,179
agency that oversees FDA so I said hey

701
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:36,060
this would be a good idea and then there

702
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:38,710
was a particularly amazing

703
00:28:36,060 --> 00:28:40,990
innovative policy person inside the FDA

704
00:28:38,710 --> 00:28:44,620
who said how can we do this in a way

705
00:28:40,990 --> 00:28:47,050
that enhances patient safety and isn't

706
00:28:44,620 --> 00:28:48,570
overly burdensome on American businesses

707
00:28:47,050 --> 00:28:50,039
and I think they they

708
00:28:48,570 --> 00:28:51,990
hit it and said this is this gives us

709
00:28:50,039 --> 00:28:53,789
the right benefit with the minimal cost

710
00:28:51,990 --> 00:28:55,259
and so they went forward for it they

711
00:28:53,789 --> 00:28:57,389
already had the legend the Regulatory

712
00:28:55,259 --> 00:28:59,429
Authority and medical device

713
00:28:57,389 --> 00:29:02,219
manufacturers are already regulated

714
00:28:59,429 --> 00:29:03,509
right you can't put a device in a

715
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:05,970
hospital without going through a bunch

716
00:29:03,509 --> 00:29:08,070
of tests first so compared to some of

717
00:29:05,970 --> 00:29:11,519
the other sectors it's going to be a

718
00:29:08,070 --> 00:29:12,779
much lower lift not it not trivial I

719
00:29:11,519 --> 00:29:14,399
don't want to understate how much work

720
00:29:12,779 --> 00:29:16,139
is happening by some of the medical

721
00:29:14,399 --> 00:29:17,879
device manufacturers but I think it's

722
00:29:16,139 --> 00:29:20,969
it's a great way to learn and for the

723
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:24,419
rest of us to watch cool thank you

724
00:29:20,970 --> 00:29:26,690
alright I think I'm now out of time

725
00:29:24,419 --> 00:29:29,580
which means you get to go and enjoy a

726
00:29:26,690 --> 00:29:32,429
fantastic night I'll be sticking around

727
00:29:29,580 --> 00:29:34,379
at the after room discussion room

728
00:29:32,429 --> 00:29:36,509
whatever we're calling the Alan loses

729
00:29:34,379 --> 00:29:38,459
his voice room more than happy to chat

730
00:29:36,509 --> 00:29:40,379
