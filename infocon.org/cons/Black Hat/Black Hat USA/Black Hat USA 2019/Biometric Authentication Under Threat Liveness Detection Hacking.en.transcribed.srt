1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,910
good morning everyone you're an Islander

2
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:07,910
II I and welcome to biometric

3
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:14,280
authentication under threat liveness

4
00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:15,809
detection hacking with HC maou stop by

5
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:18,180
the business Hall today located in

6
00:00:15,809 --> 00:00:20,850
Mandalay Bay Oceanside and shoreline

7
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:23,400
ballrooms in level 2 during the day and

8
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:25,859
at 5:30 tonight for the Welcome

9
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:29,930
Reception that's also the location of

10
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:29,930
the blackhat Arsenal and if you would

11
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:37,780
you

12
00:00:47,789 --> 00:00:56,309
okay thank you guys okay today are gonna

13
00:00:53,579 --> 00:01:00,539
talk about how to do the biometric

14
00:00:56,309 --> 00:01:03,000
authentication attack so before we get a

15
00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:06,869
start and I have to introduce my team

16
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:09,090
and we who are we we are from Tencent

17
00:01:06,869 --> 00:01:11,490
the biggest media social media and

18
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:13,920
entertainment company in China

19
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:17,539
and we from the attention secured Asian

20
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:20,670
lab and we do a lot of applied and

21
00:01:17,539 --> 00:01:25,909
real-world security research especially

22
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:30,210
the the carrying age technology and the

23
00:01:25,909 --> 00:01:34,130
last year a Weprin we printed a new

24
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:39,690
vulnerability of in display fingerprint

25
00:01:34,130 --> 00:01:44,640
sensors and so actually this research

26
00:01:39,690 --> 00:01:48,360
was was done by mostly by the HN and

27
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:51,000
Bhima and I'm not actually involved in

28
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:53,610
this project too much and because the

29
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:57,330
don't get the visa to come here so I

30
00:01:53,610 --> 00:02:01,679
have to apprise presence this talk

31
00:01:57,330 --> 00:02:05,310
instead of them so if and all your

32
00:02:01,679 --> 00:02:09,598
applause and and honors belongs to the

33
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:15,360
to them so okay here is the outline of

34
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:18,359
my talk and roughly my talk is divided

35
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:22,349
to two parts and the first part is how

36
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:24,870
how we do the secondary injection to

37
00:02:22,349 --> 00:02:28,619
bypass the Lebanese detection and the

38
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:32,819
second part is about how we exploit the

39
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:36,629
insecure recognition sins and the to

40
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:40,859
bypass the attention detection so before

41
00:02:36,629 --> 00:02:45,269
I get go in deeper to to my talk I have

42
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:47,879
to clear clarify some basic back

43
00:02:45,269 --> 00:02:53,190
background of my talk and the first is

44
00:02:47,879 --> 00:02:55,590
what is parametric authentication so so

45
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:58,599
biometric authentication is trying is

46
00:02:55,590 --> 00:03:01,599
the the device use some sensors

47
00:02:58,599 --> 00:03:03,760
to collect your information like your

48
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:07,388
face and the voice and the fingerprint

49
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:11,560
and the erase and and also the palm

50
00:03:07,389 --> 00:03:14,739
print and the use that some to feature

51
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:18,519
matching and to see if you are the

52
00:03:14,739 --> 00:03:21,219
person that's authorized so and it's it

53
00:03:18,519 --> 00:03:24,010
contains a lot of application of my

54
00:03:21,219 --> 00:03:26,519
array and you can use these kind of

55
00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:30,189
authentication to unlock your phone and

56
00:03:26,519 --> 00:03:34,269
to recover your password and also you

57
00:03:30,189 --> 00:03:36,099
can use to plug in the apps and in China

58
00:03:34,269 --> 00:03:39,730
we use this for a real name

59
00:03:36,099 --> 00:03:43,418
authentication so in the bottom you can

60
00:03:39,730 --> 00:03:47,168
see is the typical progress and how to

61
00:03:43,419 --> 00:03:50,680
how the biometric authentication works

62
00:03:47,169 --> 00:03:53,099
and the the first is trying to collect

63
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:56,889
the information and do some

64
00:03:53,099 --> 00:04:00,988
pre-processing to attend the the

65
00:03:56,889 --> 00:04:05,199
collection into some machine recognized

66
00:04:00,989 --> 00:04:08,290
data data stream or some kind of data

67
00:04:05,199 --> 00:04:11,349
and then if the sensor we're trying to

68
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:14,590
do the lis eliminates detection after

69
00:04:11,349 --> 00:04:16,899
the elimination action passed and it

70
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:20,858
will turn to the fetcher matching and to

71
00:04:16,899 --> 00:04:24,159
see if you are the person so what is

72
00:04:20,858 --> 00:04:26,849
eliminates detection and detection is

73
00:04:24,159 --> 00:04:30,610
trying to identify the if you are the

74
00:04:26,849 --> 00:04:35,320
this person and not the default

75
00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:38,610
intensity that you are trying to unlock

76
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:41,229
the form or you use the biometric

77
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:44,259
authentication so there are a lot of

78
00:04:41,229 --> 00:04:48,340
methods to do these kind of detection

79
00:04:44,259 --> 00:04:52,150
so like the the sensor can just

80
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:55,539
distinguish the the the pasture and to

81
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:59,109
see if the the texture is like a human

82
00:04:55,539 --> 00:05:02,409
skin or not the like like a photo or

83
00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:08,230
something like and they can also to do

84
00:05:02,409 --> 00:05:13,110
the optical flow and to see if is a skin

85
00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:17,290
and I'm not also there are a lot of

86
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:19,780
interactive action check and there will

87
00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:23,770
be some command and display on the

88
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:26,619
screen for you to a note or shaken door

89
00:05:23,770 --> 00:05:30,729
open house and to see if you have a live

90
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:34,290
person and also in an iPhone or some

91
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:38,200
other smartphones it will be some

92
00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:42,280
specific hardware to do the luminous

93
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:45,039
detection and this the third concept I

94
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:48,130
have to emphasize is the the facility

95
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:51,600
the attention detection so attention

96
00:05:48,130 --> 00:05:54,820
detection is kind of to check if you are

97
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:56,830
if you are look at the camera you when

98
00:05:54,820 --> 00:06:00,570
you're trying to use your phone and lock

99
00:05:56,830 --> 00:06:03,820
the usual face to unlock your phone so

100
00:06:00,570 --> 00:06:07,719
differently the this attention attention

101
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:11,830
detection is enabled and whenever you

102
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:14,830
want a lot a disabled it will be alert

103
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:18,550
shown at the right

104
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:23,080
so with the with the thing with this

105
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:28,780
detection was enabled so there is a

106
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:33,359
stupid way to train you to try to bypass

107
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:36,789
this attack this attention detection so

108
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:41,950
absolutely my talk will not cover these

109
00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:44,380
kind of kind of waited to Chewbacca's to

110
00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:50,200
Bob has this and I will introduce also a

111
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:53,770
low-cost way to do it so and we come to

112
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:56,950
to summarize the previous studies on

113
00:06:53,770 --> 00:06:59,530
this area and mostly they mainly focus

114
00:06:56,950 --> 00:07:04,659
around who generates the fake video and

115
00:06:59,530 --> 00:07:09,010
audio to bypass the but to to to the

116
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:12,550
attack but they they are not feel very

117
00:07:09,010 --> 00:07:14,740
feel research and the focus on how to

118
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:17,050
did that has the eliminates detection

119
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:19,780
because the libyans

120
00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:23,139
is crucial because you you have to pass

121
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:28,299
it and then you can use your stuff to

122
00:07:23,139 --> 00:07:31,750
bypass the authentication and also there

123
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:35,080
there are some research on how to bypass

124
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:38,169
the face ID with the 3d marks and but

125
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:41,889
that requires a lot of information and

126
00:07:38,169 --> 00:07:46,990
and it was proved too is now it's not

127
00:07:41,889 --> 00:07:51,759
easy to reproduce so so our research is

128
00:07:46,990 --> 00:07:56,080
mainly focus only how we pass the

129
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:58,330
Leibniz detection so here we go to the

130
00:07:56,080 --> 00:08:02,289
the first part and how we do the Signori

131
00:07:58,330 --> 00:08:05,169
injection and before let's just go back

132
00:08:02,289 --> 00:08:07,419
to see what what were what's the

133
00:08:05,169 --> 00:08:13,270
difference between you when you write

134
00:08:07,419 --> 00:08:15,940
when to the to the biometric often taken

135
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:20,020
with with real information and the fake

136
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:22,120
information if you are you when you use

137
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:26,500
face face for the biometric

138
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:30,819
authentication and the fake one will

139
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:34,059
lost some h/ss our space color and

140
00:08:30,819 --> 00:08:36,789
because the because you are trying to

141
00:08:34,059 --> 00:08:41,399
use some video or you're some photos and

142
00:08:36,789 --> 00:08:44,439
that that's the less some colors will be

143
00:08:41,399 --> 00:08:47,320
will be lost when the camera capture

144
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:50,350
that that there are things and there

145
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:54,040
were also some focus blood and the

146
00:08:50,350 --> 00:08:56,770
texture is also it's not the same or not

147
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:59,560
the similar and the optical flow is

148
00:08:56,770 --> 00:09:04,600
obviously is not it's another important

149
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:07,689
way to detect is the difference and some

150
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:10,630
some kind of sensor sensor we're trying

151
00:09:07,690 --> 00:09:13,360
to do some frequency response and to see

152
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:18,370
if the if the material you are trying to

153
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:22,329
intact to evoke the the phone is if the

154
00:09:18,370 --> 00:09:27,160
same or the similar to the human skins

155
00:09:22,329 --> 00:09:29,370
of human organs and so another

156
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:32,319
another element so we are trying to

157
00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:34,750
unlock the phone with your voice and

158
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:38,380
there are also some difference so the

159
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:41,320
first is some playback reverberation up

160
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:45,580
right and so and also the the background

161
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:48,010
noise it's not not the same so how do

162
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:54,400
how about in inject a signal directly

163
00:09:48,010 --> 00:09:58,120
and so with the if you we think about

164
00:09:54,400 --> 00:10:01,630
how to inject the signal and that we can

165
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:06,130
avoid any information lost when do the

166
00:10:01,630 --> 00:10:09,450
secondary will do the second area

167
00:10:06,130 --> 00:10:13,480
Christian and we can also have the

168
00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:18,580
attack medium classics so you can just

169
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:22,030
control it by our software and and is if

170
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:27,220
you we do it in the hardware level and

171
00:10:22,030 --> 00:10:32,819
is not detected by some the higher

172
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:35,800
software so here is the info the

173
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:38,680
requirements how we if we want to do the

174
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:42,310
injection we want the low density

175
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:45,630
because because the just we wants the

176
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:50,500
system axial act of native and native

177
00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:53,320
just as little delay as as possible to

178
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:57,270
just like a native camera and we can

179
00:10:53,320 --> 00:11:02,380
also we need good the capabilities and

180
00:10:57,270 --> 00:11:05,890
just to make it suit for most situation

181
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:08,500
and we want the fake data P can be

182
00:11:05,890 --> 00:11:12,970
generated and imported in the real time

183
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:16,240
and we we can and the fourth is we want

184
00:11:12,970 --> 00:11:18,550
this transparent and which cannot be

185
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:22,030
detected by any emulator or and they

186
00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:25,120
could a software technology and so here

187
00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:27,790
is our scheme as you can see and at the

188
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:32,890
bottom is just a schematic of the of our

189
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:36,160
our solution and we we just we used a

190
00:11:32,890 --> 00:11:40,360
module to convert the HDMI signal to the

191
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:44,680
si si si si signal because the most

192
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:47,680
device used si si si Saket to to connect

193
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:51,040
their camera and we will use that module

194
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:55,719
to convert to the HDMI signal and then

195
00:11:51,040 --> 00:12:00,189
connect to our PC and the that make us

196
00:11:55,720 --> 00:12:03,610
the the camera can be simulated as the

197
00:12:00,190 --> 00:12:05,950
output of your PC so you can just to do

198
00:12:03,610 --> 00:12:09,839
all these other things in your PC and

199
00:12:05,950 --> 00:12:14,769
generate generate and played the audio

200
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:19,600
audio video and in your PC so and then

201
00:12:14,769 --> 00:12:22,959
we debug we hook up the another one the

202
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:26,730
back line to monitor the the interactive

203
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:30,209
action and to see if we can just

204
00:12:26,730 --> 00:12:33,880
generate the corresponding video

205
00:12:30,209 --> 00:12:37,029
according to the command and here is the

206
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:40,480
just a real picture and and the left is

207
00:12:37,029 --> 00:12:47,529
the schematic and the right is the whole

208
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:50,430
setup and we come to the demo okay so we

209
00:12:47,529 --> 00:12:55,140
use just a photo to generate the

210
00:12:50,430 --> 00:12:58,029
animation with some software and we use

211
00:12:55,140 --> 00:13:04,209
script to make it work

212
00:12:58,029 --> 00:13:08,589
splitting and it's not and they is just

213
00:13:04,209 --> 00:13:14,670
turn around and then we just connect it

214
00:13:08,589 --> 00:13:18,220
to our device kit and outfits the the

215
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:22,540
signal to the develop teeth and that is

216
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:33,130
make it act as a camera in the dirac it

217
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:39,610
just minute and it's just like a camera

218
00:13:33,130 --> 00:13:43,000
so then we can manipulating the video in

219
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:46,949
in in in the pc and just like the

220
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:51,399
initiative cameras capturing the image

221
00:13:46,949 --> 00:13:53,339
so okay and another part is we're doing

222
00:13:51,399 --> 00:13:56,850
the audio in

223
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:58,950
and that's is quite the same we use

224
00:13:56,850 --> 00:14:05,150
another module to convert audio to them

225
00:13:58,950 --> 00:14:05,150
to a Mac and then we can reconnect it

226
00:14:11,510 --> 00:14:13,569
you

227
00:14:21,370 --> 00:14:26,830
The Voice they want they want us to

228
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:32,410
speak out and the test or the random

229
00:14:26,830 --> 00:14:37,660
number so here is how setup we we just

230
00:14:32,410 --> 00:14:43,839
propose to virgins and the for Android

231
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:46,209
and the iOS device so you might think

232
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:49,150
this this kind of attack is useless

233
00:14:46,210 --> 00:14:52,870
because you cannot open open app the

234
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:57,689
victim device and you cannot just hook

235
00:14:52,870 --> 00:15:02,680
up your assist device into is CSI CSI

236
00:14:57,690 --> 00:15:06,850
cable and inject to your injector signal

237
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:10,140
but what if our target is the some kind

238
00:15:06,850 --> 00:15:13,780
of app login with with a biometric

239
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:18,430
signal so what about we is prove it and

240
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:20,500
we can't prove the what our ideas is

241
00:15:18,430 --> 00:15:23,589
come from this talk is also by my

242
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:27,040
colleague and we what we want to do is

243
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:30,370
trying to prove the whole device and we

244
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:35,980
do the all the when we do this research

245
00:15:30,370 --> 00:15:39,940
and we found if the the biometric

246
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:43,150
authentication for app is not defaulted

247
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:48,520
did enabled on a dual device but if we

248
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:51,760
try if we Forge and the the server

249
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:55,360
trying to collect the the the local

250
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:58,300
device fingerprint and uploaded and

251
00:15:55,360 --> 00:16:00,820
uploaded and then the stored and bind

252
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:05,890
all the this information to your account

253
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:08,650
and after that and they can enable it so

254
00:16:05,890 --> 00:16:12,040
if we can steal all the this device

255
00:16:08,650 --> 00:16:15,490
information and we can forge these we

256
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:19,030
can forge this device and then we can

257
00:16:15,490 --> 00:16:23,710
enabled in our control the system and so

258
00:16:19,030 --> 00:16:26,319
the the general steps to do this the

259
00:16:23,710 --> 00:16:29,080
device fingerprints proofing is trying

260
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:32,230
the first we reverse engineer on the

261
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:33,390
algorithm and how they collect all the

262
00:16:32,230 --> 00:16:36,180
disconnect from

263
00:16:33,390 --> 00:16:41,670
and then we steal the information from

264
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:46,380
any any Talent technique and because you

265
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:49,860
can as you can see then some some some

266
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:52,529
kind of information is cannot be can be

267
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:55,350
stilled without touching the victims

268
00:16:52,529 --> 00:16:57,300
device so after that we inject all the

269
00:16:55,350 --> 00:17:00,959
information to our control system and

270
00:16:57,300 --> 00:17:04,889
then we enable these these things so

271
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:07,260
here we can become su to our new threat

272
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:10,079
mode to combine this two kind of

273
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:11,069
technology and the first is we trying to

274
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:14,399
do

275
00:17:11,069 --> 00:17:19,319
device fingerprinting and then we

276
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:22,400
collect some victims assault and voice

277
00:17:19,319 --> 00:17:26,220
recording and then we generate we

278
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:28,919
generate fake video and our audio audio

279
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:31,559
materials dependence all the material

280
00:17:28,919 --> 00:17:34,140
will collect it and then we to the

281
00:17:31,559 --> 00:17:38,549
hardware injection then we can login

282
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:40,890
into the the the app or the device and

283
00:17:38,549 --> 00:17:46,440
then we we can just recover their

284
00:17:40,890 --> 00:17:50,190
password and we hack it so this set the

285
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:55,260
second part is how we do the explore the

286
00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:58,220
insecure recognization scenes so why

287
00:17:55,260 --> 00:18:02,580
does this kind of same exists because

288
00:17:58,220 --> 00:18:08,010
when the window trying to divide the yes

289
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:10,620
I mention is Apple and we will is trying

290
00:18:08,010 --> 00:18:13,460
to design their biometric authentication

291
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:17,959
they have to consider some special

292
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:21,559
situation and so unlike the the light

293
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:25,530
situation and the environment and like

294
00:18:21,559 --> 00:18:31,139
likely when you wearing glasses and also

295
00:18:25,530 --> 00:18:33,860
this noise and accent so so too they

296
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:36,570
have to consider this kind of special

297
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:38,639
situation so to the

298
00:18:36,570 --> 00:18:42,480
when they trying to apply their

299
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:46,080
authentication to this special situation

300
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:48,930
and that means not they have to balance

301
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:52,100
the user experience and the security so

302
00:18:48,930 --> 00:18:56,370
not kind of not all the security attack

303
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:59,580
will be used so the attacker can apply

304
00:18:56,370 --> 00:19:04,639
to utilize these kind of things and to

305
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:09,360
just get the defection to kind of the

306
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:13,320
attacker controls a scenario and to to

307
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:16,409
do some attack so let's come to how we

308
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:19,379
bypass the attention detection of face

309
00:19:16,410 --> 00:19:22,950
ID and the challenge is we we don't want

310
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:24,960
to wake up the when the victim is

311
00:19:22,950 --> 00:19:28,080
sleeping we don't want to wake up them

312
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:30,690
and also the 3di

313
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:33,889
are the the technology and the

314
00:19:30,690 --> 00:19:38,220
information cannot be easy to forge and

315
00:19:33,890 --> 00:19:43,590
and also we don't want to a very huge

316
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:47,070
high caste and so so how we can do we

317
00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:51,689
don't want to do do this bypass likely

318
00:19:47,070 --> 00:19:55,020
the the GF video there so how we can do

319
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:57,570
so after we do some research with an

320
00:19:55,020 --> 00:20:01,050
some weak points and that's the fish

321
00:19:57,570 --> 00:20:04,889
idea allows use user to unlock the phone

322
00:20:01,050 --> 00:20:07,770
when they were in classes but and but in

323
00:20:04,890 --> 00:20:10,230
this situation they want if you are

324
00:20:07,770 --> 00:20:13,110
worrying classes they won't instructor

325
00:20:10,230 --> 00:20:16,110
3d information and they they trying to

326
00:20:13,110 --> 00:20:18,810
match the to these character races

327
00:20:16,110 --> 00:20:22,439
instead of 3ds so that's the clue one

328
00:20:18,810 --> 00:20:24,720
and in this case we can catch the the

329
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:28,920
algorithm trying to match the treat to

330
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:33,870
the eyes and the second the second fact

331
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:37,290
is if we if the victim or if the user in

332
00:20:33,870 --> 00:20:40,379
the dark environment and we we will do a

333
00:20:37,290 --> 00:20:45,090
serious equipment and we found if the

334
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:47,360
the we can just as abstract our eyes to

335
00:20:45,090 --> 00:20:51,049
just like a black area

336
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:54,860
and what point on it that's the just a

337
00:20:51,049 --> 00:20:58,760
2d eyes abstraction so that's the the

338
00:20:54,860 --> 00:21:02,090
second clue and the third is so what is

339
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:04,960
when when you're trying to attention

340
00:21:02,090 --> 00:21:09,620
attention detector so what's the

341
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:13,040
abstraction of of that is really simple

342
00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:16,010
it's just a wet point it's in the middle

343
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:19,639
of the black area so combined of these

344
00:21:16,010 --> 00:21:24,020
Clues we divide about the upper device

345
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:26,870
and this the simple device we use it to

346
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:31,418
bypass all the attention detection it's

347
00:21:26,870 --> 00:21:34,879
really simple just ordinary glasses with

348
00:21:31,419 --> 00:21:39,860
two kind of tapes one is black and the

349
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:44,000
other is white so it's ultra low cost

350
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:46,639
and we hide with high success rate and

351
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:48,440
it's really critical and you can just

352
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:53,809
make it in just two minutes

353
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:57,350
so here is we come to the demo and here

354
00:21:53,809 --> 00:22:02,330
is just the the situation with has we we

355
00:21:57,350 --> 00:22:10,428
enabled the attention of this ID and so

356
00:22:02,330 --> 00:22:13,909
become the video sorry so here's the

357
00:22:10,429 --> 00:22:17,179
victim he is sleeping and his phone is

358
00:22:13,910 --> 00:22:22,400
on the table and we trying to unlock it

359
00:22:17,179 --> 00:22:25,570
and just this is not successful because

360
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:31,580
the attention detection is enabled and

361
00:22:25,570 --> 00:22:35,840
after that and you can see some things

362
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:38,418
on the on the table one is our X classes

363
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:42,918
and the others or the material will make

364
00:22:38,419 --> 00:22:46,870
this classes and we try to wear this

365
00:22:42,919 --> 00:22:46,870
class to the victim

366
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:56,990
hopefully he won't he won't wake up and

367
00:22:52,730 --> 00:23:03,280
you can see is still sleeping and we

368
00:22:56,990 --> 00:23:09,940
trying to unlock the phone again and as

369
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:09,940
you can see the phone is unlocked

370
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:21,310
[Applause]

371
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:24,130
okay so what about the mitigation of all

372
00:23:21,310 --> 00:23:28,240
the vulnerability we found and the first

373
00:23:24,130 --> 00:23:33,000
is how to avoid the hardware hardware

374
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:38,530
layer injection so first we proposed is

375
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:41,380
you're better to use trusted camera to

376
00:23:38,530 --> 00:23:45,540
collect the the face information and

377
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:50,470
that can be cannot be faulted easily and

378
00:23:45,540 --> 00:23:54,399
forbidden to not accept any voice from

379
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:57,400
the microphone cable and ask if you just

380
00:23:54,400 --> 00:24:00,370
oh boy the really audio injection and

381
00:23:57,400 --> 00:24:05,760
then you can tend to increase the weight

382
00:24:00,370 --> 00:24:09,459
the synthesis detection and trying to so

383
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:13,150
the last one you strike you better to

384
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:17,640
some use some device fighting mechanism

385
00:24:13,150 --> 00:24:21,100
to detect the proofing so the method

386
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:23,710
mitigation for the for the acts glasses

387
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:27,639
contact is it's really simple you can

388
00:24:23,710 --> 00:24:31,030
just detect it the the tester and also

389
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:35,980
the tip tips information of a high at a

390
00:24:31,030 --> 00:24:41,310
high area and to see if the I Israel so

391
00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:44,350
we come to the conclusion and we propose

392
00:24:41,310 --> 00:24:47,020
Universal methodologies how how we

393
00:24:44,350 --> 00:24:49,929
bypass the live living as detection and

394
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:53,639
we use the hardware level signal

395
00:24:49,930 --> 00:24:57,700
injection and we also create create some

396
00:24:53,640 --> 00:25:01,330
just reverse the algorithm of attention

397
00:24:57,700 --> 00:25:04,600
attention detection and to see we found

398
00:25:01,330 --> 00:25:07,649
the weak point and we also proposed a

399
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:10,709
new threat mode and to how to capacity

400
00:25:07,650 --> 00:25:13,030
the whole secure system and with

401
00:25:10,710 --> 00:25:17,960
injection and the device fingerprints

402
00:25:13,030 --> 00:25:24,119
proofing and yeah that's it thank you

403
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:24,119
[Applause]
