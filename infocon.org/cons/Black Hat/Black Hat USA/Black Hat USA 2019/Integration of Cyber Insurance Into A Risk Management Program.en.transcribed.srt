stage

12
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:27,029
Jeremiah Grossman to introduce our next

13
00:00:26,279 --> 00:00:30,029
speaker

14
00:00:27,029 --> 00:00:31,250
thanks Jeremiah all right welcome back

15

everybody thanks for hanging with us

16
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:36,360
Jeffrey Smith from gave us a nice

17
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:38,010
one-on-one talk on how to look at cyber

18
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:40,890
insurance some of the terminology how

19
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:42,480
its position how its sold the next

20
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:44,460
speaker I'm real excited up this is at

21
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:46,379
Jake Coons from risk-based security he

22
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:48,149
is one of us he's InfoSec he has worked

23
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:50,010
on the insurance side and he's gonna

24
00:00:48,149 --> 00:00:52,050
walk us through now that you have a

25
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:53,730
cyber insurance policy how does that fit

26
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:56,780
into the organization and what you can

27
00:00:53,730 --> 00:01:00,589
do to maximize both both sides of it so

28
00:00:56,780 --> 00:01:00,590
Jake Jake Elena

29
00:01:03,450 --> 00:01:11,360
[Applause]

30
00:01:06,470 --> 00:01:15,509
alright how's everyone doing we're good

31
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:17,939
alrighty so yeah so I am part two of

32
00:01:15,509 --> 00:01:20,100
this summit which I'm pretty happy that

33
00:01:17,939 --> 00:01:22,679
is getting organized we're gonna talk

34
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:24,270
just about that integrating integration

35
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:27,590
of cyber insurance into a risk

36
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:31,408
management program now before I begin

37
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:33,810
when I I'm sort of a unique guy I guess

38
00:01:31,409 --> 00:01:35,220
because I was a security guy and then I

39
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:38,100
went and worked in the cyber insurance

40
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:39,450
world and then I came back out right so

41
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:41,280
I don't know if I went to the dark side

42
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:42,929
or came to the dark side it sort of gets

43
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,369
a little confusing but for those that

44
00:01:42,929 --> 00:01:45,899
sort of know me and are wondering who

45
00:01:44,369 --> 00:01:47,610
this guy is on stage I typically look

46
00:01:45,899 --> 00:01:49,770
like that up there right all clean-cut

47
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:51,630
but here recently I decided to grow a

48
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:53,520
beard and get some privacy and be

49
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:54,780
anonymous again and it works wonders

50
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:56,220
people walk by me they don't know who

51
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:56,610
the heck I am whatsoever it's pretty

52
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:59,880
hilarious

53
00:01:56,610 --> 00:02:02,509
but I've spent a lot of time in the

54
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:04,229
security space tracking data breaches

55
00:02:02,509 --> 00:02:06,149
understanding trying to make better

56
00:02:04,229 --> 00:02:08,369
decisions from a security standpoint and

57
00:02:06,149 --> 00:02:10,590
how I got into the whole Insurance space

58
00:02:08,369 --> 00:02:11,970
was trying to help carriers understand

59
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:13,350
how to make those better decisions and

60
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:15,840
figure out what's going on underwrite

61
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:18,390
all those sorts of things all right

62
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:19,829
before I get going I do want to talk

63
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:21,570
about the state of security from my

64
00:02:19,829 --> 00:02:23,489
standpoint just for a bit and a lot of

65
00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:24,780
what we heard in the 101 session there's

66
00:02:23,489 --> 00:02:26,430
going to be a little repetition here

67
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:28,739
from a little bit of a different point

68
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:32,040
of view not that it's a different sort

69
00:02:28,739 --> 00:02:35,430
of stance on it but just you'll hear

70
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:37,380
from from sort of my take on things but

71
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:39,450
in the state of security right this is

72
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:40,799
the data breach landscape right on the

73
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:43,200
left-hand side here we're looking at

74
00:02:40,799 --> 00:02:46,079
frequency the number of data breaches

75
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:47,429
that are occurring over time right and

76
00:02:46,079 --> 00:02:49,380
then on the right-hand side we're

77
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:50,910
looking at severity how bad is it

78
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:52,920
because not all data breaches are the

79
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:54,480
same we know that right and so on the

80
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:55,768
left-hand side I think you can just see

81
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:58,980
that like we're not seeing things get

82
00:02:55,769 --> 00:03:00,750
better right for all the vendors and all

83
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:02,190
the shiny boxes and things that you can

84
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:04,769
buy out there we're not seeing it

85
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:06,720
directly relate to a decrease of the

86
00:03:04,769 --> 00:03:10,500
number of data breaches that were able

87
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:12,060
to find right not happening and then the

88
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:13,799
right-hand side the severity chart is

89
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:15,690
just it looks ridiculous now because

90
00:03:13,799 --> 00:03:17,790
there's so many records are being lost

91
00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:18,960
all those prior years there they sort of

92
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:21,030
look so small right

93
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:23,220
but when you when you talk about 2018

94
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:26,300
and you go what a great year we only

95
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:29,490
lost 5 billion records we got better

96
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:31,530
right something's not quite right but I

97
00:03:29,490 --> 00:03:32,970
think when you think about this we all

98
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:34,020
know about certain data breaches that

99
00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:35,460
are out there and big ones that are

100
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:37,110
happening but there's a lot more that's

101
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:40,920
going on that everyone's not sort of

102
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:43,080
aware of now for 2019 we just finished

103
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:44,519
up a mid-year analysis looking at all

104
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:46,620
the data breaches and what's happening

105
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:49,440
for the year and it's pretty startling

106
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:51,270
right because there's already been 3,800

107
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:54,329
new data breaches reported this year

108
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:57,270
right and this is ending you know for

109
00:03:54,330 --> 00:03:59,730
mid-year so end of June 4.1 billion

110
00:03:57,270 --> 00:04:01,740
records are already exposed and when we

111
00:03:59,730 --> 00:04:04,200
looked at the comparison of this

112
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:06,690
mid-year to last mid-year you know

113
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:09,630
things look horrible right the the

114
00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:12,750
number of breaches are up about 54% the

115
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:14,549
number of records exposed up 52% I do

116
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:16,829
get tired of getting on stage and saying

117
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:19,260
we're on track for yet another worst

118
00:04:16,829 --> 00:04:21,209
year ever but it's going to be the worst

119
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:22,830
year ever for data breaches at least in

120
00:04:21,209 --> 00:04:23,400
frequency side it looks like it without

121
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:26,219
a doubt

122
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:27,929
okay so just we're not making the

123
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:30,120
improvements you know in the end results

124
00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:33,720
that we hope to on the security front so

125
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:34,980
with that said let's be honest do we

126
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:37,410
think it's only a matter of time for

127
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:39,240
organizations do you sit there and as

128
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:42,210
embarrassing it as it is as a security

129
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:45,050
professional say it isn't if it's a

130
00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:47,340
matter of when is it a ticking time bomb

131
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:49,080
well I think if you guys were all honest

132
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:50,190
you'd start to go yeah we're a little

133
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:51,450
worried right we try to do everything

134
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:53,960
that we can and it still has the

135
00:04:51,450 --> 00:04:56,640
potential to result in a data breach and

136
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:59,130
further I don't want to get into any

137
00:04:56,640 --> 00:05:01,800
religious fights about how much the cost

138
00:04:59,130 --> 00:05:03,810
per record is I have no desire to do

139
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:04,710
that right there's lots of conversations

140
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:06,540
about what it cost

141
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:08,609
but do we all agree that a data breach

142
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:11,370
will cost you money is it gonna cost you

143
00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:15,170
something yes we know that's going to be

144
00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:17,940
the case right so here we are now we

145
00:05:15,170 --> 00:05:18,720
have data that suggests that data

146
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:20,760
breaches aren't getting better

147
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:24,300
frequencies up things continue to go

148
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:26,969
wrong right we all sort of feel whether

149
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:28,680
we want to admit it or not that a data

150
00:05:26,970 --> 00:05:30,480
breach at our company organization is

151
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:31,620
quite likely and we know it's going to

152
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:35,520
cost us money

153
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:37,680
right so with that in mind let's start

154
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:43,799
to think a little bit here about risk

155
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:46,770
management and insurance okay reality of

156
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:48,810
risk we have risk we know this this is

157
00:05:46,770 --> 00:05:50,460
what we're in the business of we not we

158
00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:52,139
might not always talk about that in our

159
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:53,669
each of our security roles right we may

160
00:05:52,139 --> 00:05:55,650
say oh that's the risk team that does

161
00:05:53,669 --> 00:05:57,060
that and we do other things but we're

162
00:05:55,650 --> 00:05:59,310
all dealing with risk as security

163
00:05:57,060 --> 00:06:01,199
professionals okay and our training

164
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:03,030
we've talked about this forever there

165
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:05,910
are four things that you can do with

166
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:07,109
risk right we hope to avoid risk that

167
00:06:05,910 --> 00:06:09,060
makes the most sense right we don't want

168
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:12,300
to if we can avoid it that's great if

169
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:15,360
not we want to mitigate risk we're gonna

170
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:17,039
do something controls whatever it may be

171
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:18,330
whatever the next vendor solution is

172
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:20,159
that's gonna help us right we're gonna

173
00:06:18,330 --> 00:06:22,550
do something to mitigate these these

174
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:24,810
risks now there may be times when

175
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:26,460
there's just a business reason that says

176
00:06:24,810 --> 00:06:28,320
that risk is okay and we're gonna accept

177
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:29,969
it right and you really hope that you're

178
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:31,320
not in an organization where they don't

179
00:06:29,970 --> 00:06:32,940
care and they just sort of sign off

180
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:35,219
exceptions and waivers and no one cares

181
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:37,950
we actually hope that there's legitimate

182
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:39,090
reason to accept risks right but there

183
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:42,510
actually is this fourth thing called

184
00:06:39,090 --> 00:06:44,520
transfer of risk right again for all you

185
00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:46,080
the studied security and certifications

186
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:47,849
we always have to say this but as

187
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:49,650
security professionals we really haven't

188
00:06:47,849 --> 00:06:52,950
gotten our heads wrapped around it or or

189
00:06:49,650 --> 00:06:54,539
as accepted it is maybe as we want so

190
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:56,669
when we think about what those transfer

191
00:06:54,539 --> 00:06:59,310
options are there's a couple of them

192
00:06:56,669 --> 00:07:01,380
right so the first is outsourcing right

193
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:01,889
so if we want to let someone else deal

194
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:03,810
with it

195
00:07:01,889 --> 00:07:06,539
we can do that right we can outsource

196
00:07:03,810 --> 00:07:08,490
risk and and activities that maybe we're

197
00:07:06,539 --> 00:07:09,870
not best to handle right you see a lot

198
00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:11,250
of people doing that with payment card

199
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:14,970
processing and other things of that

200
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:17,280
nature we can also transfer risk when it

201
00:07:14,970 --> 00:07:18,780
comes to contracts and agreements we can

202
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:21,388
write things in there that says hey you

203
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:22,919
deal with this right it's possible and

204
00:07:21,389 --> 00:07:24,090
then the one that we're here to spend

205
00:07:22,919 --> 00:07:26,070
the most time about today is obviously

206
00:07:24,090 --> 00:07:29,340
insurance right we can definitely

207
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:30,840
transfer risk with insurance that's part

208
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:31,760
of the main you know purpose of the

209
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:35,250
whole thing

210
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:36,630
now I think you have to get your head

211
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:38,970
wrapped around some of the basics of

212
00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:41,219
insurance before you jump into the the

213
00:07:38,970 --> 00:07:43,320
the cyber parts of it I know I did when

214
00:07:41,219 --> 00:07:45,330
I was getting involved in it so why the

215
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:48,000
heck does people in purchase insurance

216
00:07:45,330 --> 00:07:49,289
right and and for a second just step

217
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,150
back and think about yourself don't

218
00:07:49,289 --> 00:07:53,250
think about all the cyber stuff for a

219
00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:54,810
second so why do we do it well yeah we

220
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:56,430
want to roost reduce some liability

221
00:07:54,810 --> 00:07:58,349
that's probably a good thing right no

222
00:07:56,430 --> 00:08:00,900
matter what it is we want to be able to

223
00:07:58,349 --> 00:08:02,878
cover losses if that's what happens or

224
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:05,940
what we need to do there may be some

225
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:07,379
legal requirement right that says hey

226
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:10,919
you know you need to have insurance so

227
00:08:07,379 --> 00:08:13,460
you can't do this and that could be all

228
00:08:10,919 --> 00:08:15,568
sorts of things that happens right

229
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:16,948
sometimes they get a loan or an

230
00:08:15,569 --> 00:08:19,979
investment or things of that nature you

231
00:08:16,949 --> 00:08:22,080
need insurance but many times insurance

232
00:08:19,979 --> 00:08:24,270
is just for like a peace of mind right

233
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:25,530
you just want to feel better you want to

234
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:27,210
put your head on the pillow at night and

235
00:08:25,530 --> 00:08:28,979
say yeah something goes wrong I'm okay

236
00:08:27,210 --> 00:08:31,530
I'm covered right someone's there to

237
00:08:28,979 --> 00:08:33,419
help me out so there's lots of lots of

238
00:08:31,530 --> 00:08:35,939
reasons that motivate people to get any

239
00:08:33,419 --> 00:08:37,799
types of insurance now the other thing

240
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:38,940
you got to think about is insurance is

241
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:41,279
typically purchased for your most

242
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:42,599
valuable assets right if you have some

243
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:44,939
things you don't really care about it

244
00:08:42,599 --> 00:08:47,010
you go out and buy insurance for it if

245
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:48,269
you have a really nice car right you're

246
00:08:47,010 --> 00:08:49,500
probably get insurance if you have some

247
00:08:48,269 --> 00:08:51,870
beater sitting out back that you

248
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:53,880
probably I don't need insurance right so

249
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:55,890
we're looking at this in terms of

250
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:58,230
there's reasons driving insurance

251
00:08:55,890 --> 00:09:01,500
purchase right and then it's for our

252
00:08:58,230 --> 00:09:03,089
most valuable assets there's lots of

253
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:05,310
different types of insurance out there

254
00:09:03,089 --> 00:09:08,520
tons of it there's insurance to cover

255
00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:11,250
our people right there are insurance for

256
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:13,800
buildings property things within the

257
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:15,720
buildings if you buy some expensive toys

258
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:18,839
and yachts you can insure them if you do

259
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:20,459
some you know crazy activities and

260
00:09:18,839 --> 00:09:22,680
motorcycles you can get all that sort of

261
00:09:20,459 --> 00:09:23,880
insurance we of course know there's

262
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:26,279
medical insurance so there's always

263
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:27,949
conversation about that but then you

264
00:09:26,279 --> 00:09:29,790
start getting another assurance that

265
00:09:27,949 --> 00:09:31,109
sometimes maybe you don't know if you

266
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:33,149
need it or not but it definitely has a

267
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:35,070
place in life right who's gone into

268
00:09:33,149 --> 00:09:36,839
their local electronics store and you

269
00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:38,459
buy a new phone or a TV and you go to

270
00:09:36,839 --> 00:09:40,290
walk out and say hey you want to buy

271
00:09:38,459 --> 00:09:44,130
that insurance coverage plan and you

272
00:09:40,290 --> 00:09:45,899
have a moment of do i right hopefully

273
00:09:44,130 --> 00:09:47,399
most of you don't but I guess maybe if

274
00:09:45,899 --> 00:09:48,839
you think it's worthwhile and it's the

275
00:09:47,399 --> 00:09:51,350
right decision for you you'll do it

276
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:54,029
right but they even have insurance for

277
00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:55,800
travel you're gonna go out and do a big

278
00:09:54,029 --> 00:09:57,490
cruise and you're gonna travel somewhere

279
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:58,810
and maybe you picked the time during

280
00:09:57,490 --> 00:10:01,240
hurricane season and they say hey you

281
00:09:58,810 --> 00:10:04,899
want some insurance you can get that

282
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:07,990
right and it works but they even have

283
00:10:04,899 --> 00:10:09,580
also insurance free like events think

284
00:10:07,990 --> 00:10:11,200
about you know you're planning a big

285
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:12,880
wedding and you want to make sure it

286
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:15,220
doesn't any of that nothing goes wrong I

287
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:16,570
don't want to rain on your big day you

288
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:18,220
can actually get insurance to cover that

289
00:10:16,570 --> 00:10:20,649
day well it will respond if something

290
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:22,720
goes wrong in your event right all sorts

291
00:10:20,649 --> 00:10:24,250
of stuff is out there and a lot of this

292
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:25,990
stuff you made chuckle about it but this

293
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:27,670
is pretty common stuff that people go

294
00:10:25,990 --> 00:10:31,540
yeah this makes sense and I do this

295
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:33,610
stuff ever traveled and hit a rental car

296
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:34,870
place and then when you go to you go out

297
00:10:33,610 --> 00:10:36,279
they say hey do you want the insurance

298
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:40,029
and again you have another moment of oh

299
00:10:36,279 --> 00:10:41,770
good do I need that insurance right they

300
00:10:40,029 --> 00:10:43,240
even have insurance they call umbrella

301
00:10:41,770 --> 00:10:44,350
insurance because there's so many things

302
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:45,399
that you might not even know about will

303
00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:48,100
just try to cover all these other things

304
00:10:45,399 --> 00:10:51,339
so there's a ton of insurance out there

305
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:53,860
that is accepted and makes sense and

306
00:10:51,339 --> 00:10:56,170
those insurance drivers and in

307
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:59,350
protecting your valuable assets for the

308
00:10:56,170 --> 00:11:02,079
reasons right but when we get to cyber

309
00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:04,240
insurance people start to lose their

310
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:06,099
mind right so right about now I think

311
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:07,630
half of you are with me and smiling the

312
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:08,620
other half giving me really dirty looks

313
00:11:07,630 --> 00:11:10,720
because we're talking about cyber

314
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:11,950
insurance it's totally fine but every

315
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:14,320
time we start to bring up cyber

316
00:11:11,950 --> 00:11:16,480
insurance people sort of want to they

317
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:19,329
take a set sit back in their seat a

318
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:20,620
little bit right but do we believe that

319
00:11:19,329 --> 00:11:24,790
our systems and our data is the most

320
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:27,279
important asset of our company yes okay

321
00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:29,380
and all those reasons that we talked

322
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:34,240
about are they in play for your company

323
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:36,399
all those drivers they are right so why

324
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:39,310
do people hate cyber insurance also know

325
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:41,320
as why organizations not Baltimore cyber

326
00:11:39,310 --> 00:11:43,089
insurance right so when you try to think

327
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:45,220
about this what's what's the first one

328
00:11:43,089 --> 00:11:48,700
we think of do you guys believe that you

329
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:51,870
have unbreakable security controls did

330
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:54,339
anyone see the Oracle bus cruise in no

331
00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:55,450
right so no one's gonna sit here and

332
00:11:54,339 --> 00:11:59,350
tell us that you think you have

333
00:11:55,450 --> 00:12:00,760
unbreakable security controls some

334
00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:03,670
people may think that the coverage won't

335
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:05,560
last or it won't respond right it's sort

336
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:09,010
of not not a not a good policy it

337
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:10,479
probably won't be there for you some

338
00:12:09,010 --> 00:12:12,689
people may say it's not a good spend a

339
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:14,920
budget

340
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:17,710
some people have no clue the cyber

341
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:19,060
insurance stuff even exists right it's

342
00:12:17,710 --> 00:12:20,800
not been something that's made its

343
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:23,229
rounds in the security space as much as

344
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:25,569
maybe maybe it should have maybe there's

345
00:12:23,230 --> 00:12:27,459
other reasons something else but for the

346
00:12:25,570 --> 00:12:28,930
most part after spending time on both

347
00:12:27,459 --> 00:12:30,670
sides I'd argue that I think most

348
00:12:28,930 --> 00:12:32,380
organizations just sort of don't

349
00:12:30,670 --> 00:12:33,729
understand this cyber insurance thing

350
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:35,830
and that that's one of the reasons

351
00:12:33,730 --> 00:12:40,200
there's some negative views to it

352
00:12:35,830 --> 00:12:43,089
now when I made the decision to go from

353
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:45,250
security into the insurance world I took

354
00:12:43,089 --> 00:12:46,990
a lot of heat from all my friends right

355
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:48,670
they called me the used car salesman

356
00:12:46,990 --> 00:12:50,200
they said Jake what the hell are you

357
00:12:48,670 --> 00:12:51,880
doing to your career you're blowing

358
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:56,050
everything up this is horrible why would

359
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:57,640
you do that and I I get it right I mean

360
00:12:56,050 --> 00:12:59,740
it comes across when you talk about

361
00:12:57,640 --> 00:13:01,810
insurance there's sort of this general

362
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:05,339
feel of oh man this isn't a good

363
00:13:01,810 --> 00:13:07,569
experience right and in some ways an

364
00:13:05,339 --> 00:13:09,399
insurance sort of organization or the

365
00:13:07,570 --> 00:13:11,740
sort of the industry they've deserve

366
00:13:09,399 --> 00:13:13,540
this sort of bad reputation right I

367
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:16,000
think every one of you can think of a

368
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:18,490
personal time where you had a in an

369
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,410
interaction with insurance and it didn't

370
00:13:18,490 --> 00:13:22,660
go the way you want to right and you

371
00:13:20,410 --> 00:13:24,069
weren't happy about it whether they

372
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:26,079
didn't cover something you thought they

373
00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:27,339
should have or they covered it but they

374
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:29,080
were a pain to deal with

375
00:13:27,339 --> 00:13:30,670
and you had to fight all the time for it

376
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:32,890
or something along those lines right and

377
00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:34,479
for the same amount of those negative

378
00:13:32,890 --> 00:13:36,279
feelings I think if you're truthful and

379
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:37,810
you search back you can think hey there

380
00:13:36,279 --> 00:13:39,520
were a few times where insurance was

381
00:13:37,810 --> 00:13:42,310
there for me stepped in and helped me

382
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:44,470
sort some things out right just think in

383
00:13:42,310 --> 00:13:46,119
your personal life and so I think that's

384
00:13:44,470 --> 00:13:48,970
the sort of same thing that's going on

385
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:50,680
right now within the insurance world but

386
00:13:48,970 --> 00:13:53,440
I will tell you what I see right now is

387
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:55,540
anytime anytime there's an issue with

388
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:57,850
cyber insurance whether it's a valid one

389
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:59,199
or not the media is jumping on the fact

390
00:13:57,850 --> 00:14:01,209
that this cyber insurance stuff this

391
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:03,279
slimy straight back to the used car

392
00:14:01,209 --> 00:14:05,439
salesman this stuff's horrible right so

393
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:07,209
you know it you don't have to search far

394
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:08,980
to find out you know I think there was a

395
00:14:07,209 --> 00:14:10,839
question earlier about the act of war

396
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:12,940
stuff right when Zurich said they

397
00:14:10,839 --> 00:14:14,980
weren't paying some things and we look

398
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:17,140
at another one we talked about PF Changs

399
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:19,209
right and this was one where the cyber

400
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:21,220
insurance actually did cover quite a few

401
00:14:19,209 --> 00:14:23,800
things but they didn't cover some of the

402
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:24,700
fines and penalties right so again it

403
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:27,969
comes out that hey

404
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:29,380
lots of holes beware another one you

405
00:14:27,970 --> 00:14:32,410
know these are headlines right bank

406
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:35,439
losses 2.4 million insurance company

407
00:14:32,410 --> 00:14:37,360
says how about 50 grand right those are

408
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:39,790
things that make you go holy cow this is

409
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:41,860
this is a bad news right this is super

410
00:14:39,790 --> 00:14:43,810
bad news and then there's other ones

411
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:45,250
that you'll see lawsuits and stuff where

412
00:14:43,810 --> 00:14:46,839
it seems like it's really bad and you

413
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:48,340
start to realize they didn't even have a

414
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:50,110
cyber policy they were just trying to

415
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:52,960
get coverage on another policy somewhere

416
00:14:50,110 --> 00:14:54,940
else ok so there have been some

417
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:56,290
situations don't get me wrong where it

418
00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:58,060
feels a little slimy that insurance

419
00:14:56,290 --> 00:14:59,290
company should have done something but

420
00:14:58,060 --> 00:15:01,180
there's far far more where these

421
00:14:59,290 --> 00:15:03,670
insurance companies are in fact pain and

422
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:07,810
they are in fact living up to what the

423
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:10,150
insurance agreement looks like now I do

424
00:15:07,810 --> 00:15:13,500
want to do a quick cyber liability

425
00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:16,209
insurance recap from my perspective

426
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:19,630
there are many names and many carriers

427
00:15:16,210 --> 00:15:22,030
out there right there are a ton of them

428
00:15:19,630 --> 00:15:24,610
I do think now it is going to sort of be

429
00:15:22,030 --> 00:15:25,870
called cyber liability insurance you

430
00:15:24,610 --> 00:15:27,640
know a lot of the component of the

431
00:15:25,870 --> 00:15:29,260
insurance is liability so you'll see

432
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:31,750
that word thrown in there it's being

433
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:33,640
shortened enough to cyber insurance but

434
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:35,380
there's a whole other of these words

435
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:39,069
that you could argue that are the same

436
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:39,850
data privacy internet policies all these

437
00:15:39,070 --> 00:15:42,280
sorts of things

438
00:15:39,850 --> 00:15:45,040
I've personally gotten over the fact of

439
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:46,990
the cyber usage I don't care anymore I'm

440
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:48,730
not gonna fight the cyber term it's

441
00:15:46,990 --> 00:15:52,990
cyber insurance let's just move on okay

442
00:15:48,730 --> 00:15:54,370
now what concerns me is that there are

443
00:15:52,990 --> 00:15:55,600
so many of them out there and they are

444
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:58,600
so different there's very little

445
00:15:55,600 --> 00:16:00,460
commonality it is very very hard to

446
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:02,380
compare these things and to make sure

447
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:03,850
you understand what's going on now I

448
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:05,080
have a ton of slides coming up in here

449
00:16:03,850 --> 00:16:07,390
where I'm gonna tell you this over and

450
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:10,510
over because it's a key point not all

451
00:16:07,390 --> 00:16:11,949
the policies are the same ok so just be

452
00:16:10,510 --> 00:16:13,420
aware of this when you're looking at

453
00:16:11,950 --> 00:16:17,890
sort of these things you may find these

454
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:20,500
different words now a commercial sort of

455
00:16:17,890 --> 00:16:22,240
cyber insurance policy it's got a lot of

456
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:24,100
similarities to the things that you know

457
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:26,080
of in your your personal life whether

458
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:29,200
it's home or auto or stuff that you're

459
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:31,900
used to doing ok but because it's this

460
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:33,520
commercial policy it's not the exact

461
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:34,990
same as those homeowner things so you

462
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:37,030
got to understand the other similarities

463
00:16:34,990 --> 00:16:38,089
but things are different that you need

464
00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:41,149
to be aware of

465
00:16:38,089 --> 00:16:42,529
okay now in the one-on-one session we

466
00:16:41,149 --> 00:16:43,189
heard a little bit about first party and

467
00:16:42,529 --> 00:16:46,309
third party

468
00:16:43,189 --> 00:16:47,748
this to me was the biggest thing that I

469
00:16:46,309 --> 00:16:49,579
got my head wrapped around so I want to

470
00:16:47,749 --> 00:16:52,689
spend time from my perspective how I

471
00:16:49,579 --> 00:16:52,689
thought about this okay

472
00:16:59,850 --> 00:17:01,910
you

473
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:50,840
it's the third party we crashed into

474
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:52,520
someone and we caused the problem first

475
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:54,590
party tree fell on our car and that was

476
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:56,900
horrible but it was damage to us right

477
00:17:54,590 --> 00:17:59,689
so try to think about that as we move

478
00:17:56,900 --> 00:18:03,320
forward because we can get a cyber

479
00:17:59,690 --> 00:18:05,240
policy to cover both of those we can get

480
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:07,250
a cyber colleague go to those but you

481
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:08,570
will see some policies that come out and

482
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:10,580
you think you have one and it's only

483
00:18:08,570 --> 00:18:12,320
covering maybe the liability aspect

484
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:13,490
maybe it's only covering the third party

485
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:15,500
aspects of it okay

486
00:18:13,490 --> 00:18:17,450
so we can get those protections to

487
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:20,540
recover from an event we can get those

488
00:18:17,450 --> 00:18:22,190
protections from the lawsuits identify

489
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:24,290
and start to get your head wrapped

490
00:18:22,190 --> 00:18:26,060
around threat model whatever you want to

491
00:18:24,290 --> 00:18:29,810
do to figure out what you think would

492
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:31,520
matter for your organization we talked

493
00:18:29,810 --> 00:18:33,169
about this in the 101 but it's the same

494
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:37,129
sort of thing right most of these

495
00:18:33,170 --> 00:18:38,900
policies were set up really at a breach

496
00:18:37,130 --> 00:18:40,850
notice compliance standpoint right

497
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:43,460
something goes wrong we think we have a

498
00:18:40,850 --> 00:18:46,129
data breach so therefore we got to spend

499
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:49,100
money on forensics and legal and mailing

500
00:18:46,130 --> 00:18:50,900
lists and credit monitoring and offering

501
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:52,429
out free identity protection so we can

502
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:54,200
say oh we're really sorry please don't

503
00:18:52,430 --> 00:18:56,600
sue us take this credit monitoring right

504
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:59,930
all those sorts of things can be covered

505
00:18:56,600 --> 00:19:02,480
okay the liability aspect in many cases

506
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:05,780
used to be the core of the policy what a

507
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:09,290
carrier would push right responding to

508
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:11,930
those regulatory problems cost of

509
00:19:09,290 --> 00:19:14,180
reissuing credit cards if that's what

510
00:19:11,930 --> 00:19:15,590
the case is settlements if you have to a

511
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:17,300
whole bunch of other things can be

512
00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:19,879
covered now I just have here at the

513
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:22,250
bottom other first-party more and more

514
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:23,510
of this stuff is coming up right so when

515
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:26,450
you think about other impacts to your

516
00:19:23,510 --> 00:19:29,060
business system restoration getting you

517
00:19:26,450 --> 00:19:30,770
back up and running if there's extra

518
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:33,159
expense or extra cost to keep you

519
00:19:30,770 --> 00:19:36,260
running while an events ongoing

520
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:38,740
extortion demands ransomware phishing

521
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:42,260
lost business all these sorts of things

522
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:45,620
can be covered and in fact these cyber

523
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:47,260
policies are getting a little wild right

524
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:49,399
because the intent of the policy

525
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:52,310
originally was to help with some sort of

526
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:55,460
cyber incident attack a breach whatever

527
00:19:52,310 --> 00:19:57,200
it may be there are policies now that

528
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:57,940
are expanding out into you just messed

529
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,690
up at IT

530
00:19:57,940 --> 00:20:01,460
right

531
00:19:59,690 --> 00:20:04,070
system recovery stuff that we've talked

532
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:05,899
about so you went to do an upgrade and

533
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:07,399
one of the team members didn't do a good

534
00:20:05,899 --> 00:20:08,959
job and it caused an outage some of

535
00:20:07,399 --> 00:20:11,120
these policies now will even respond to

536
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:14,389
that so we're seeing things get very

537
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:17,178
very broad not all cyber insurance

538
00:20:14,389 --> 00:20:19,219
policies are the same they're not the

539
00:20:17,179 --> 00:20:21,590
same I can't tell you the number of

540
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:22,759
times that I've had some up come up to

541
00:20:21,590 --> 00:20:23,899
me and tell me something and I'll say

542
00:20:22,759 --> 00:20:26,000
that's great

543
00:20:23,899 --> 00:20:27,979
but it's not the same across everywhere

544
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,870
okay for whether it's a carrier or an

545
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:32,090
industry etc we need to understand this

546
00:20:29,870 --> 00:20:36,350
and stop broad brushing insurance when

547
00:20:32,090 --> 00:20:38,539
we talk about this stuff okay as helpful

548
00:20:36,350 --> 00:20:39,649
as some of these policies can be you

549
00:20:38,539 --> 00:20:40,970
should definitely expect that some

550
00:20:39,649 --> 00:20:45,469
things just are not going to be covered

551
00:20:40,970 --> 00:20:47,929
okay and in fact reputation damage is

552
00:20:45,470 --> 00:20:49,940
one of the ones when we talk about it

553
00:20:47,929 --> 00:20:52,789
all the time you think a data breach

554
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:54,950
happens and you know when it happens

555
00:20:52,789 --> 00:20:57,649
then that company's in the news quite a

556
00:20:54,950 --> 00:21:00,649
bit maybe lots of jokes are made about

557
00:20:57,649 --> 00:21:03,110
them and you know damage to brand is is

558
00:21:00,649 --> 00:21:04,820
a big one now there are some services

559
00:21:03,110 --> 00:21:06,439
and things maybe help you from a PR

560
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:07,220
standpoint and crisis and all those

561
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:09,379
sorts of things

562
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:11,120
but you're probably not going to find a

563
00:21:09,379 --> 00:21:13,459
policy that says you go in and say hey

564
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:17,539
our brand was damaged give us some money

565
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:19,039
okay so think about that one that I had

566
00:21:17,539 --> 00:21:20,649
a really hard time getting my head

567
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:24,259
wrapped around was regular maintenance

568
00:21:20,649 --> 00:21:27,110
sort of upgrades and fixes when you

569
00:21:24,259 --> 00:21:29,179
think about it insurance is for a fact

570
00:21:27,110 --> 00:21:31,370
to get you back to where you were right

571
00:21:29,179 --> 00:21:33,259
I think in your personal life if you're

572
00:21:31,370 --> 00:21:35,090
driving a nice Honda Civic and life is

573
00:21:33,259 --> 00:21:36,409
good and you get into a wreck the

574
00:21:35,090 --> 00:21:37,970
insurance company doesn't come back and

575
00:21:36,409 --> 00:21:39,590
say here's that new Ferrari for you

576
00:21:37,970 --> 00:21:41,899
right they're trying to get you back to

577
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:45,799
where you were so let's say your

578
00:21:41,899 --> 00:21:49,008
organization has a an old really really

579
00:21:45,799 --> 00:21:50,840
old phone system right and there's a

580
00:21:49,009 --> 00:21:53,059
hack on that there's some sort of breach

581
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:54,529
something goes wrong the insurance

582
00:21:53,059 --> 00:21:55,789
company is going to try to get you back

583
00:21:54,529 --> 00:21:57,679
to where you were they're not gonna show

584
00:21:55,789 --> 00:22:00,408
up and be like here's a nice new shiny

585
00:21:57,679 --> 00:22:02,720
voice over IP system that's state of the

586
00:22:00,409 --> 00:22:04,639
arc that's not what's gonna happen right

587
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:06,710
now they're not gonna want to try to put

588
00:22:04,639 --> 00:22:08,059
you back to a situation where you're

589
00:22:06,710 --> 00:22:10,879
gonna get you have another compromised

590
00:22:08,059 --> 00:22:12,620
but it's a weird situation sometimes and

591
00:22:10,879 --> 00:22:14,389
you just have to be mindful of that okay

592
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:17,330
insurance policies not there to like

593
00:22:14,390 --> 00:22:20,300
maintain all this stuff for you the

594
00:22:17,330 --> 00:22:22,580
economic value of data right a lot of

595
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:25,159
times folks will talk about confidential

596
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:29,629
business plans or the secret formula for

597
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:30,140
some you know medicine or whatever it

598
00:22:29,630 --> 00:22:33,110
may be

599
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:34,640
really hard to go and say ah this is

600
00:22:33,110 --> 00:22:37,000
what this is worth pay me money

601
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:39,320
write me a check for this money okay

602
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:41,420
data in war

603
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:44,470
systems and care custody control of

604
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:46,730
others cloud or other your supply chain

605
00:22:44,470 --> 00:22:48,920
while more and more policies are

606
00:22:46,730 --> 00:22:50,330
covering this you got to be mindful of

607
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:53,360
this a lot of these policies are written

608
00:22:50,330 --> 00:22:56,030
in a way that say the named insured

609
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:58,189
system which means your stuff right

610
00:22:56,030 --> 00:23:00,678
there underwriting and reviewing your

611
00:22:58,190 --> 00:23:02,000
organization in your systems so if you

612
00:23:00,679 --> 00:23:03,740
decide hey I'm just gonna let someone

613
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:06,260
else have all these things and they'll

614
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:07,940
deal with it your policy may not respond

615
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:10,280
to that the way that you want to we've

616
00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:13,730
seen improvements in this space but you

617
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:16,790
got to be careful okay now here's some

618
00:23:13,730 --> 00:23:17,929
other not so common exclusions or ones

619
00:23:16,790 --> 00:23:20,360
that I tell you you got to be really

620
00:23:17,929 --> 00:23:22,760
careful about okay now when you're in

621
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:24,320
the insurance world when you're trying

622
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:27,350
to write a new product like cyber

623
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:29,270
insurance and you don't have a good idea

624
00:23:27,350 --> 00:23:31,159
about what you're doing you try to

625
00:23:29,270 --> 00:23:33,559
figure out how do you do this but not

626
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:35,510
expose yourself so much right and so a

627
00:23:33,559 --> 00:23:37,070
lot of times carriers will cover

628
00:23:35,510 --> 00:23:39,710
something but they'll put a small limit

629
00:23:37,070 --> 00:23:42,169
in there right so at the end of the day

630
00:23:39,710 --> 00:23:43,760
they say yeah we we cover ransomware but

631
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:45,890
if you look in the policy maybe it's a

632
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:47,960
small dollar amount right so you want to

633
00:23:45,890 --> 00:23:51,230
be careful not only do they cover it but

634
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:53,300
how much is covered okay exclusions they

635
00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:55,160
they make sense at some point right

636
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:56,419
there are certain things for a carrier

637
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:58,340
that they just don't want to cover and

638
00:23:56,420 --> 00:24:00,050
that's fine but if you look at some of

639
00:23:58,340 --> 00:24:01,220
these ones up here these are these are

640
00:24:00,050 --> 00:24:03,889
scary okay

641
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:07,040
you really don't want these failure to

642
00:24:03,890 --> 00:24:09,140
encrypt data we used to see this a lot

643
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:10,580
it's for the you know the good carriers

644
00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:12,230
they're moving away from this stuff so

645
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:14,360
you shouldn't see it but there were a

646
00:24:12,230 --> 00:24:16,280
lot of times where you lost that laptop

647
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:18,979
and it wasn't encrypted no coverage

648
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:20,840
you didn't encrypt right that's not a

649
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:22,820
good thing the second one up there

650
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:25,110
failure to maintain or take reasonable

651
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:27,330
steps to maintain security

652
00:24:25,110 --> 00:24:30,750
that's a horrible one you should run

653
00:24:27,330 --> 00:24:32,520
right we could make anyone look silly

654
00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:33,780
right within two seconds oh you didn't

655
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:35,639
do that you didn't do the right thing

656
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:39,899
that's a sort of we're not gonna pay

657
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:41,520
claims exclusion okay now again not all

658
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:43,110
policies have this so for the love of

659
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:45,180
God don't walk out of here and go I knew

660
00:24:43,110 --> 00:24:46,260
that stuff sucked right but these are

661
00:24:45,180 --> 00:24:51,060
things that you're going to want to look

662
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:53,220
for widespread issues widespread viruses

663
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:57,149
were mobile things we've seen that sort

664
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:59,280
of been excluded we've seen regulations

665
00:24:57,150 --> 00:25:01,650
and standards sort of rear their head

666
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:05,850
you're not compliant with PCI DSS no

667
00:25:01,650 --> 00:25:08,610
coverage right that's not helpful we've

668
00:25:05,850 --> 00:25:10,590
seen Wireless come up the the

669
00:25:08,610 --> 00:25:13,620
unauthorized access started through a

670
00:25:10,590 --> 00:25:16,560
wireless network not covered clouds a

671
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:18,540
stuff not covered okay now big business

672
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:20,639
income loss is one that's getting a bit

673
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:23,159
better not everyone cares about this who

674
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:25,860
needs this but if you were let's say an

675
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:27,810
e-commerce organization and you're

676
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:29,520
offline for a lot of time there can be

677
00:25:27,810 --> 00:25:31,710
coverage that says I will get you back

678
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:33,540
up and running oh and hey you were also

679
00:25:31,710 --> 00:25:35,370
facing a denial of service and so we had

680
00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:36,510
to bring on you know extra equipment and

681
00:25:35,370 --> 00:25:38,550
bandwidth and all these sorts of things

682
00:25:36,510 --> 00:25:39,930
we'll cover all that but you're gonna

683
00:25:38,550 --> 00:25:41,760
tell me that you were down for ten hours

684
00:25:39,930 --> 00:25:45,030
and you lost millions and millions of

685
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:47,670
dollars in sales not covering that but

686
00:25:45,030 --> 00:25:49,710
there are policies that will there will

687
00:25:47,670 --> 00:25:51,990
now you've got to read the fine print

688
00:25:49,710 --> 00:25:54,750
too because let's say you're down on

689
00:25:51,990 --> 00:25:56,700
Black Friday and you could say hey you

690
00:25:54,750 --> 00:25:58,470
know I usually do twenty million dollars

691
00:25:56,700 --> 00:26:00,510
there there's some wording in there I'll

692
00:25:58,470 --> 00:26:02,880
say we're gonna average it out over two

693
00:26:00,510 --> 00:26:04,500
months or three months okay but there

694
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:07,640
are there is becoming coverage for these

695
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:10,500
things because it's a need the final one

696
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:12,000
and and we've sort of dabbled around at

697
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:13,650
business interruption or you'll hear the

698
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:18,000
industry the insurance recall it will be

699
00:26:13,650 --> 00:26:20,190
I write it's an interesting one because

700
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,840
the insurance carrier is there to get

701
00:26:20,190 --> 00:26:23,550
you back up and running right that's in

702
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:26,040
their best interest but there's this

703
00:26:23,550 --> 00:26:29,100
concept now called contingent bi and

704
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:31,050
it's something that scares carriers and

705
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:33,179
I'm sure Matt will talk about it or

706
00:26:31,050 --> 00:26:35,580
maybe you'll avoid it I'm not sure but

707
00:26:33,180 --> 00:26:37,620
when you think about a carrier they're

708
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:38,610
not too upset about handling a couple

709
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:40,678
claims that come in

710
00:26:38,610 --> 00:26:43,678
that's that's something they're prepared

711
00:26:40,679 --> 00:26:45,480
for they take good care and reserving

712
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:48,090
money to pay claims that's not a problem

713
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:50,789
but if all of a sudden Amazon goes down

714
00:26:48,090 --> 00:26:53,070
and thousands of claims coming or the

715
00:26:50,789 --> 00:26:54,929
the grid goes down on the East Coast and

716
00:26:53,070 --> 00:26:57,210
every one of their there ensures their

717
00:26:54,929 --> 00:26:59,909
something comes in those are some

718
00:26:57,210 --> 00:27:01,230
there's a mega-events right I didn't

719
00:26:59,909 --> 00:27:03,929
want to put up the cyber hurricane

720
00:27:01,230 --> 00:27:06,029
picture I saved you from that but those

721
00:27:03,929 --> 00:27:07,620
systemic aggregation events are the ones

722
00:27:06,029 --> 00:27:09,539
that really really scare them and

723
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:13,620
contingent bi is one of those things

724
00:27:09,539 --> 00:27:15,510
where an internet provider goes down if

725
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:17,219
someone else goes down and has an

726
00:27:15,510 --> 00:27:19,250
interruption and impacts you they may

727
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:21,809
not want to cover okay

728
00:27:19,250 --> 00:27:22,250
now I've said it before I'm gonna say it

729
00:27:21,809 --> 00:27:24,510
again

730
00:27:22,250 --> 00:27:25,649
not all these cyber insurance policies

731
00:27:24,510 --> 00:27:28,769
are the same you got actually read this

732
00:27:25,649 --> 00:27:30,178
stuff you got to read the policy and if

733
00:27:28,769 --> 00:27:33,389
it's gonna put you to sleep just hire

734
00:27:30,179 --> 00:27:35,549
someone to read it for you right a good

735
00:27:33,389 --> 00:27:37,830
broker can help work with you to

736
00:27:35,549 --> 00:27:40,049
understand what you care about what your

737
00:27:37,830 --> 00:27:41,549
organization faces and tell you the good

738
00:27:40,049 --> 00:27:43,260
policies and cut through a lot of the

739
00:27:41,549 --> 00:27:45,658
noise you don't need to go out there and

740
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:48,149
read 500 to 700 insurance policies I

741
00:27:45,659 --> 00:27:49,980
promise you that do not do that right

742
00:27:48,149 --> 00:27:51,330
you can cut through to the good ones or

743
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:53,549
you can get a broker or someone to help

744
00:27:51,330 --> 00:27:56,220
you find those right policies for you

745
00:27:53,549 --> 00:27:58,769
you've got to read this stuff right you

746
00:27:56,220 --> 00:28:01,080
can't get mad that a claim wasn't paid

747
00:27:58,769 --> 00:28:02,429
when your organization didn't choose

748
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:04,379
that coverage they said we don't need

749
00:28:02,429 --> 00:28:06,450
who would need ransomware coverage we

750
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:10,350
don't need that right those are the

751
00:28:06,450 --> 00:28:12,630
things now integrating cyber insurance

752
00:28:10,350 --> 00:28:16,769
we've come to sort of some important

753
00:28:12,630 --> 00:28:19,159
parts here from my standpoint executives

754
00:28:16,769 --> 00:28:21,630
understand risk they understand risk

755
00:28:19,159 --> 00:28:23,220
they may not understand all the security

756
00:28:21,630 --> 00:28:25,350
nerd stuff we talked to them about but

757
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:27,659
they understand risk they understand how

758
00:28:25,350 --> 00:28:30,080
to avoid mitigate accept and transfer

759
00:28:27,659 --> 00:28:32,429
risk organizations are already

760
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:34,019
transferring risk okay

761
00:28:32,429 --> 00:28:35,100
this is already happening all that

762
00:28:34,019 --> 00:28:37,350
insurance we talked about in the

763
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:38,850
beginning this is already happening now

764
00:28:37,350 --> 00:28:40,559
the the part that needs to get a bit

765
00:28:38,850 --> 00:28:42,320
better is a lot of this stuff happens

766
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:44,340
over in another organization and again

767
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:45,720
depending on what size company you come

768
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:47,250
from and where you are things will be

769
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:49,380
handled differently but a lot of

770
00:28:47,250 --> 00:28:50,760
insurance purchases happen in the

771
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:51,510
business side the enterprise risk

772
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:54,150
management

773
00:28:51,510 --> 00:28:56,700
to the house right and so property

774
00:28:54,150 --> 00:28:59,810
they're buying casually coverage for

775
00:28:56,700 --> 00:29:01,980
accidents what's called EPLI employee

776
00:28:59,810 --> 00:29:04,500
liability workers comp if people get

777
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:06,150
hurt and then again we talk about that

778
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:08,280
you know insurance that errors an

779
00:29:06,150 --> 00:29:09,690
omission that's if your company says

780
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:10,320
it's doing something and it doesn't do

781
00:29:09,690 --> 00:29:12,660
it quite right

782
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:14,129
I can guarantee you most of your

783
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:17,430
companies if not all of them have this

784
00:29:14,130 --> 00:29:18,870
kind of insurance okay so we need to

785
00:29:17,430 --> 00:29:22,440
start talking with the executives about

786
00:29:18,870 --> 00:29:24,090
risk from our standpoint I feel like we

787
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:25,410
we're finally coming around from

788
00:29:24,090 --> 00:29:27,780
security folks that were saying that

789
00:29:25,410 --> 00:29:29,880
getting to perfect security we sort of

790
00:29:27,780 --> 00:29:32,129
get that that's not going to happen for

791
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:33,690
a really long time right every security

792
00:29:32,130 --> 00:29:35,280
professional wanted to like do

793
00:29:33,690 --> 00:29:37,410
everything possible and get us to this

794
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:39,540
nirvana state at perfect security and

795
00:29:37,410 --> 00:29:40,890
while that would be great it sort of

796
00:29:39,540 --> 00:29:42,930
feels like we've gotten to the point now

797
00:29:40,890 --> 00:29:45,780
where we realize we can only take things

798
00:29:42,930 --> 00:29:48,450
so far and you know if you go to work

799
00:29:45,780 --> 00:29:49,889
with a company to help them and they're

800
00:29:48,450 --> 00:29:52,020
just starting a security program or you

801
00:29:49,890 --> 00:29:53,730
go into an organization or you look at

802
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:55,020
your own even if they don't think

803
00:29:53,730 --> 00:29:56,790
they're doing security they have some

804
00:29:55,020 --> 00:29:58,889
level of security in place right and

805
00:29:56,790 --> 00:30:00,720
then as you spend money some of that

806
00:29:58,890 --> 00:30:02,550
initial money that you spend raises the

807
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:03,870
bar pretty quickly and then it gets to a

808
00:30:02,550 --> 00:30:05,070
point where like you can go out and

809
00:30:03,870 --> 00:30:06,989
spend millions and millions of dollars

810
00:30:05,070 --> 00:30:09,030
more and it's only moving the needle so

811
00:30:06,990 --> 00:30:11,490
much further right so there's this

812
00:30:09,030 --> 00:30:14,430
diminishing returns of how many more

813
00:30:11,490 --> 00:30:16,440
things can we put in place and so we ask

814
00:30:14,430 --> 00:30:17,940
professionals right security folks we

815
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:20,760
try to figure out where is that optimal

816
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:23,100
space right where is that you know right

817
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:24,420
spot to be and you don't want to be too

818
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:25,740
low but you also I'm gonna be spending

819
00:30:24,420 --> 00:30:28,020
too much money that it's not really

820
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:29,550
helping the organization and this is

821
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:31,830
where that transferring risk stuff comes

822
00:30:29,550 --> 00:30:33,300
in this is where it's a key point you

823
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:35,100
can get your organization to a right

824
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:36,990
spot spending the right amount of money

825
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:39,750
and then for those other gaps we're

826
00:30:36,990 --> 00:30:41,430
buying the next greatest security thing

827
00:30:39,750 --> 00:30:44,130
isn't working you can start to look at

828
00:30:41,430 --> 00:30:46,620
transferring things so for an exercise

829
00:30:44,130 --> 00:30:47,730
just to get our heads around this now

830
00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:49,469
I'm sure a lot of you are from

831
00:30:47,730 --> 00:30:50,640
enterprises because we're out here at

832
00:30:49,470 --> 00:30:52,350
blackhat but let's just get our heads

833
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:55,140
wrapped around this from a small

834
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:57,209
business standpoint let's say that

835
00:30:55,140 --> 00:30:58,830
there's a small business out there their

836
00:30:57,210 --> 00:31:00,300
yearly revenues are between two and five

837
00:30:58,830 --> 00:31:02,970
million dollars okay for the sake of

838
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:03,809
argument if we started talking to them

839
00:31:02,970 --> 00:31:05,489
and said

840
00:31:03,809 --> 00:31:07,830
what do you need to do for security

841
00:31:05,489 --> 00:31:11,190
where do we start they need people right

842
00:31:07,830 --> 00:31:12,629
any staff security people aren't cheap

843
00:31:11,190 --> 00:31:14,669
these days so you need to you need staff

844
00:31:12,629 --> 00:31:17,009
hopefully more than one you need

845
00:31:14,669 --> 00:31:19,379
software and hardware and if I asked you

846
00:31:17,009 --> 00:31:21,389
you can only pick one thing could you

847
00:31:19,379 --> 00:31:23,428
pick one thing no right

848
00:31:21,389 --> 00:31:25,769
we need antivirus and encryption and

849
00:31:23,429 --> 00:31:27,450
firewalls and DLP and you name it we

850
00:31:25,769 --> 00:31:30,119
need a ton of stuff that we have to have

851
00:31:27,450 --> 00:31:31,529
right and then from there

852
00:31:30,119 --> 00:31:33,359
hey it's not enough that we're spending

853
00:31:31,529 --> 00:31:36,059
money internally to do this stuff we

854
00:31:33,359 --> 00:31:38,759
need we need external validation we need

855
00:31:36,059 --> 00:31:41,309
pen tests and bold scans and legal and

856
00:31:38,759 --> 00:31:42,929
compliance and all these other things so

857
00:31:41,309 --> 00:31:45,450
we're telling a small business that you

858
00:31:42,929 --> 00:31:47,070
got to do a lot of stuff right we're not

859
00:31:45,450 --> 00:31:48,179
saying you know what you can only do a

860
00:31:47,070 --> 00:31:49,769
couple things and you're good to go

861
00:31:48,179 --> 00:31:52,679
we're telling you have to do a lot of

862
00:31:49,769 --> 00:31:54,359
things for the sake of the argument and

863
00:31:52,679 --> 00:31:56,279
again we're talking about just a small

864
00:31:54,359 --> 00:31:59,849
business here two to five million and

865
00:31:56,279 --> 00:32:01,289
revenues right if they spent two hundred

866
00:31:59,849 --> 00:32:03,869
thousand dollars a year on security

867
00:32:01,289 --> 00:32:05,729
what's your initial reaction and and for

868
00:32:03,869 --> 00:32:07,559
this sake let's let's say that all the

869
00:32:05,729 --> 00:32:08,940
big spends of buying all the software in

870
00:32:07,559 --> 00:32:12,408
Harvard that's already done this is just

871
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:14,279
sort of their yearly budget for security

872
00:32:12,409 --> 00:32:16,950
everyone starts to go well that's not

873
00:32:14,279 --> 00:32:19,320
enough that's ridiculous you need to

874
00:32:16,950 --> 00:32:20,549
spend a heck of a lot more at what point

875
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:22,168
right when you're talking about a

876
00:32:20,549 --> 00:32:24,320
smaller company how much money do

877
00:32:22,169 --> 00:32:26,429
businesses need to spend on this stuff I

878
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:29,189
think we would all argue they should

879
00:32:26,429 --> 00:32:30,359
spend more but if they spend more does

880
00:32:29,190 --> 00:32:34,080
that guarantee they don't have a breach

881
00:32:30,359 --> 00:32:35,309
I think the beginning of our talk we all

882
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:37,589
agreed that that wouldn't guarantee

883
00:32:35,309 --> 00:32:39,599
anything right so this is when you start

884
00:32:37,589 --> 00:32:41,849
getting into the insurance stuff and how

885
00:32:39,599 --> 00:32:43,979
can you think about this as part of a

886
00:32:41,849 --> 00:32:46,468
larger program right because right now

887
00:32:43,979 --> 00:32:50,549
the cost for insurance it's ridiculously

888
00:32:46,469 --> 00:32:52,499
cheap it's way too cheap I've said this

889
00:32:50,549 --> 00:32:55,799
for a couple years now and it's still

890
00:32:52,499 --> 00:32:57,989
cheap there are so many carriers trying

891
00:32:55,799 --> 00:32:59,639
to get into this space that prices

892
00:32:57,989 --> 00:33:02,429
continue to push down from what I see

893
00:32:59,639 --> 00:33:05,129
now we may be at a tipping point with

894
00:33:02,429 --> 00:33:07,559
certain types of coverages right but at

895
00:33:05,129 --> 00:33:10,978
the end of the day costs are so low it's

896
00:33:07,559 --> 00:33:12,899
just it's eye-opening right when you can

897
00:33:10,979 --> 00:33:15,770
get a million dollars in cyber insurance

898
00:33:12,899 --> 00:33:19,850
coverage for under a thousand dollars

899
00:33:15,770 --> 00:33:21,770
it's why opening right now pricing can

900
00:33:19,850 --> 00:33:23,840
change based on industry and your

901
00:33:21,770 --> 00:33:25,639
controls don't get me wrong so there

902
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:26,720
will be some of you that'll maybe go out

903
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:28,520
and take a look or you're giving me

904
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:30,050
dirty looks saying oh it was way more

905
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:33,080
when I got a quote right yeah it's

906
00:33:30,050 --> 00:33:35,389
totally true totally possible I would

907
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:37,010
also argue that controls aren't as big

908
00:33:35,390 --> 00:33:39,170
of a factor as we all would love them to

909
00:33:37,010 --> 00:33:41,210
be and in fact there's a lot of carriers

910
00:33:39,170 --> 00:33:42,770
out there that do no underwriting they

911
00:33:41,210 --> 00:33:45,230
will hate me to say this but they'll

912
00:33:42,770 --> 00:33:47,030
look at your revenues they'll look at

913
00:33:45,230 --> 00:33:51,380
your industry and say there you go

914
00:33:47,030 --> 00:33:53,420
that's about it right if I told you the

915
00:33:51,380 --> 00:33:54,590
number of security companies that

916
00:33:53,420 --> 00:33:56,120
thought they were gonna get rich on

917
00:33:54,590 --> 00:33:58,010
insurance and used to come to me and say

918
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:59,570
I got a great idea you know what for

919
00:33:58,010 --> 00:34:01,700
every one of your applications that come

920
00:33:59,570 --> 00:34:03,460
in I'll do a fifteen thousand dollar pen

921
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:05,720
test on them for you would that be great

922
00:34:03,460 --> 00:34:07,460
charge of a thousand dollars why would I

923
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:09,260
spend more money like so so there's

924
00:34:07,460 --> 00:34:10,879
definitely some math going on here that

925
00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:13,639
you need to you need to think about okay

926
00:34:10,879 --> 00:34:15,710
but right now it is so cheap it is

927
00:34:13,639 --> 00:34:16,909
unbelievable and a lot of these smaller

928
00:34:15,710 --> 00:34:18,710
companies when you talk to them about

929
00:34:16,909 --> 00:34:20,540
security they're not out here at

930
00:34:18,710 --> 00:34:22,580
blackhat they're not spending all this

931
00:34:20,540 --> 00:34:25,369
time on they're confused by security and

932
00:34:22,580 --> 00:34:27,980
they're not able to do a whole lot now

933
00:34:25,369 --> 00:34:30,350
larger organizations for many of you in

934
00:34:27,980 --> 00:34:31,940
the room right you can get insurance for

935
00:34:30,350 --> 00:34:34,850
a reasonable cost too I believe

936
00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:36,740
okay now just just for sake of argument

937
00:34:34,850 --> 00:34:37,909
here let's just say a large hospital

938
00:34:36,739 --> 00:34:42,080
let's say they're two billion in

939
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:43,820
revenues okay for that let's say under a

940
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:46,219
hundred thousand dollars for a million

941
00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:48,290
dollars in coverage five million in

942
00:34:46,219 --> 00:34:50,868
coverage yeah maybe under two hundred

943
00:34:48,290 --> 00:34:53,899
thousand dollars maybe less with the

944
00:34:50,869 --> 00:34:56,629
competition who knows but it's not a ton

945
00:34:53,899 --> 00:34:58,220
of money it's not so crazy when you

946
00:34:56,629 --> 00:34:59,630
think about it and in terms of what

947
00:34:58,220 --> 00:35:02,810
you're spending on other controls okay

948
00:34:59,630 --> 00:35:04,910
now what's also interesting is when you

949
00:35:02,810 --> 00:35:08,779
try to figure out how many comments of

950
00:35:04,910 --> 00:35:12,140
limits you need what you need okay there

951
00:35:08,780 --> 00:35:14,540
are some carriers that will stay low

952
00:35:12,140 --> 00:35:15,680
they only write maybe a million maybe

953
00:35:14,540 --> 00:35:17,420
they'll go up to ten million and they'll

954
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:18,799
stick around there there's some other

955
00:35:17,420 --> 00:35:21,530
carriers that are willing to put out a

956
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:23,330
hundred million dollars they'll give you

957
00:35:21,530 --> 00:35:26,210
a hundred million dollars as what's

958
00:35:23,330 --> 00:35:28,069
called a primary insurance policy mean

959
00:35:26,210 --> 00:35:29,270
they're the first ones that gives you

960
00:35:28,070 --> 00:35:30,650
that policy

961
00:35:29,270 --> 00:35:32,270
now if you look at your organization and

962
00:35:30,650 --> 00:35:33,770
you start to do the math and you go whoo

963
00:35:32,270 --> 00:35:36,680
we got a lot of data we got a lot of

964
00:35:33,770 --> 00:35:39,500
stuff we need more than that you can

965
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:41,450
build these things called towers you'll

966
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:42,530
hear it called excess where you go to

967
00:35:41,450 --> 00:35:44,299
one company they give you a hundred

968
00:35:42,530 --> 00:35:46,460
million then you and then your broker or

969
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:47,690
someone say hey any other carriers you

970
00:35:46,460 --> 00:35:49,520
want to put a hundred on top and they'll

971
00:35:47,690 --> 00:35:52,340
just add all this insurance on and then

972
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:55,850
you have this big tower of money we've

973
00:35:52,340 --> 00:35:57,200
seen it 750 million maybe more but

974
00:35:55,850 --> 00:36:00,200
around that range so you can get some

975
00:35:57,200 --> 00:36:01,129
really large towers now of course the

976
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:03,080
large you go your net the more you're

977
00:36:01,130 --> 00:36:03,530
gonna spend but you can get these towers

978
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:05,900
okay

979
00:36:03,530 --> 00:36:08,780
pricing again changes on industry

980
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:11,120
changes on controls what I have seen so

981
00:36:08,780 --> 00:36:12,200
far is risk management services that

982
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:14,180
were it was covered earlier where you

983
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:15,770
can get all these small businesses can

984
00:36:14,180 --> 00:36:18,350
get all these really cool things

985
00:36:15,770 --> 00:36:19,880
large organizations don't don't tend to

986
00:36:18,350 --> 00:36:21,770
like them and I'll tend to use them as

987
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:23,960
much so again with all these policies

988
00:36:21,770 --> 00:36:25,400
right there'll be these free services

989
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:26,810
that come along because a carrier

990
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:29,870
doesn't want to lose a million dollars

991
00:36:26,810 --> 00:36:31,670
in and for a breach so they'll start to

992
00:36:29,870 --> 00:36:34,850
spend money to give companies free

993
00:36:31,670 --> 00:36:36,320
services small businesses love it I get

994
00:36:34,850 --> 00:36:37,490
a million dollars in coverage for a

995
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:39,950
thousand dollars and you're gonna give

996
00:36:37,490 --> 00:36:41,359
me all these free services my security

997
00:36:39,950 --> 00:36:43,850
guys over here tell me I got to spend

998
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:45,980
more and more and more so it's really

999
00:36:43,850 --> 00:36:49,279
interesting now one of the key things

1000
00:36:45,980 --> 00:36:50,570
for large enterprises that I like is

1001
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:51,950
that if you don't want to use the risk

1002
00:36:50,570 --> 00:36:54,050
management services that's okay

1003
00:36:51,950 --> 00:36:56,180
but you can start to use some of their

1004
00:36:54,050 --> 00:36:59,720
vendors as we discussed and we'll talk

1005
00:36:56,180 --> 00:37:01,040
about a bit more okay I don't have I

1006
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:03,140
said this before not all cyber insurance

1007
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:05,200
policies are the same nor are they

1008
00:37:03,140 --> 00:37:08,660
priced the same you need to shop around

1009
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:09,680
definitely shop around good brokers

1010
00:37:08,660 --> 00:37:11,660
gonna do that for you

1011
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:13,190
right they'll even go to some carriers

1012
00:37:11,660 --> 00:37:14,960
and say I don't know I don't know that's

1013
00:37:13,190 --> 00:37:16,640
a little high what can you do they can

1014
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:17,900
get you good rates at the right price

1015
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:20,839
and make sure you're getting the right

1016
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:22,100
policy so in my view there are

1017
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:25,610
definitely some limitations of these

1018
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:27,230
cyber insurance policies but I find that

1019
00:37:25,610 --> 00:37:28,880
there's real value on them and and

1020
00:37:27,230 --> 00:37:32,560
depending on the industry and who you

1021
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:34,490
are there can be some amazing value now

1022
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:36,460
it's pretty funny when you go out to

1023
00:37:34,490 --> 00:37:38,270
Google and you search about insurance

1024
00:37:36,460 --> 00:37:39,950
this one came up which I thought was

1025
00:37:38,270 --> 00:37:42,470
great right who says insurance isn't

1026
00:37:39,950 --> 00:37:44,720
fabulous but I'll tell you that

1027
00:37:42,470 --> 00:37:46,910
surance wasn't always as sexy as it is

1028
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:49,520
as now and maybe it really even is it

1029
00:37:46,910 --> 00:37:51,200
but I will tell you at blackhat it was

1030
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:53,480
definitely not accepted very well

1031
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:57,169
because for quite some time I was trying

1032
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:58,880
to get cyber insurance in here and I

1033
00:37:57,170 --> 00:38:00,710
actually went back to all the reject

1034
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:02,570
letters that I got from the CFP board

1035
00:38:00,710 --> 00:38:05,330
and it was quite funny so my very first

1036
00:38:02,570 --> 00:38:07,310
reject from from blackhat was in 2011

1037
00:38:05,330 --> 00:38:09,560
and I was trying to talk about who pays

1038
00:38:07,310 --> 00:38:11,270
when your data goes missing and 2012 I

1039
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:12,680
thought maybe they're ready for it maybe

1040
00:38:11,270 --> 00:38:16,400
they're now you know ready for it the

1041
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:18,740
next year so 2012 rejected again it took

1042
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:20,840
a little time off I figured okay I'll

1043
00:38:18,740 --> 00:38:24,080
give give blackhat an arrest try it

1044
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:27,920
again in 2016 and in 2017 rejects

1045
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:29,630
rejects right now one of the letters

1046
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:31,190
that I found because I had all these

1047
00:38:29,630 --> 00:38:33,380
emails for some reason was one of the

1048
00:38:31,190 --> 00:38:35,480
funniest things that I saw in the reject

1049
00:38:33,380 --> 00:38:38,450
comment it says I appreciate the need

1050
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:41,090
for this talk but not at blackhat right

1051
00:38:38,450 --> 00:38:43,129
and so what I think's happening now is

1052
00:38:41,090 --> 00:38:44,690
not just sort of looking at Google

1053
00:38:43,130 --> 00:38:46,940
Trends about talking about cyber

1054
00:38:44,690 --> 00:38:49,430
insurance and all that but as black hat

1055
00:38:46,940 --> 00:38:51,290
grows as our profession continues to

1056
00:38:49,430 --> 00:38:52,819
grow and mature we're looking at all

1057
00:38:51,290 --> 00:38:54,800
these things to do with risk right it's

1058
00:38:52,820 --> 00:38:56,359
not just all offensive you know

1059
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:58,339
technical things there are some of these

1060
00:38:56,359 --> 00:38:59,480
these tools like cyber insurance that

1061
00:38:58,339 --> 00:39:02,570
matter that we need at least get our

1062
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:04,280
heads wrapped around so I don't really

1063
00:39:02,570 --> 00:39:07,760
care if you love insurance or you hate

1064
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:09,710
it I could care less I just want you to

1065
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:11,780
understand what it is and what's going

1066
00:39:09,710 --> 00:39:15,440
on okay so here are some things that I

1067
00:39:11,780 --> 00:39:17,119
want you to know I believe firmly that

1068
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:20,330
if your organization doesn't already

1069
00:39:17,119 --> 00:39:22,580
have insurance it's going to whether you

1070
00:39:20,330 --> 00:39:24,799
like it or not and a lot of that I'm

1071
00:39:22,580 --> 00:39:27,049
seeing driven by regulatory contracts

1072
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:28,359
tough regulatory or whether it's just

1073
00:39:27,050 --> 00:39:30,830
contracts like if you're a company

1074
00:39:28,359 --> 00:39:32,299
providing services to someone else we're

1075
00:39:30,830 --> 00:39:35,150
starting to see line items that just say

1076
00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:37,130
you need to have cyber insurance now I

1077
00:39:35,150 --> 00:39:40,369
will tell you it doesn't say you need to

1078
00:39:37,130 --> 00:39:41,450
have good cyber insurance right but it's

1079
00:39:40,369 --> 00:39:42,890
saying that you need to have cyber

1080
00:39:41,450 --> 00:39:44,299
insurance so I think more and more of

1081
00:39:42,890 --> 00:39:45,580
this is is going to come to your

1082
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:49,520
organization whether you like it or not

1083
00:39:45,580 --> 00:39:51,619
from a responder standpoint and you need

1084
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:53,240
to be really really careful I will talk

1085
00:39:51,619 --> 00:39:55,089
some more about this but from a security

1086
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:58,328
professional standpoint I want

1087
00:39:55,089 --> 00:40:01,390
people more engaged okay so help to fill

1088
00:39:58,329 --> 00:40:04,660
out the application I can tell you so

1089
00:40:01,390 --> 00:40:06,670
many times I have not seen IT or IT

1090
00:40:04,660 --> 00:40:09,129
security specifically involved in the

1091
00:40:06,670 --> 00:40:11,259
insurance acquisition process if you're

1092
00:40:09,130 --> 00:40:13,210
a really large enterprise it's more

1093
00:40:11,259 --> 00:40:16,180
likely right that you've been involved

1094
00:40:13,210 --> 00:40:18,309
but I've seen even cases where a broker

1095
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:20,140
will say oh don't worry about talking to

1096
00:40:18,309 --> 00:40:20,829
your IT staff I'll just fill it out for

1097
00:40:20,140 --> 00:40:22,690
you

1098
00:40:20,829 --> 00:40:25,779
don't worry fill out the application

1099
00:40:22,690 --> 00:40:27,640
that's bad you don't want that okay you

1100
00:40:25,779 --> 00:40:29,049
want to be involved in that as was

1101
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:32,109
mentioned before you want to be honest

1102
00:40:29,049 --> 00:40:33,670
about where you are control wise you

1103
00:40:32,109 --> 00:40:35,078
don't need to exaggerate anything just

1104
00:40:33,670 --> 00:40:36,999
be honest where you are okay

1105
00:40:35,079 --> 00:40:39,789
this helps to ensure you're getting the

1106
00:40:36,999 --> 00:40:41,259
proper coverage right you want to make

1107
00:40:39,789 --> 00:40:42,700
sure that you're filling out right you

1108
00:40:41,259 --> 00:40:45,069
want to get the right coverage and you

1109
00:40:42,700 --> 00:40:46,390
need to know what it will cover you need

1110
00:40:45,069 --> 00:40:48,989
to know what's going to be covered so

1111
00:40:46,390 --> 00:40:51,848
you can have these conversations

1112
00:40:48,989 --> 00:40:54,910
the final thing there are a lot of

1113
00:40:51,849 --> 00:40:56,829
requirements in an insurance policies

1114
00:40:54,910 --> 00:40:58,299
like an agreement and there's things in

1115
00:40:56,829 --> 00:41:00,670
there that says that you have to do and

1116
00:40:58,299 --> 00:41:03,249
if you don't follow these things your

1117
00:41:00,670 --> 00:41:04,809
coverage can be nullified right so if

1118
00:41:03,249 --> 00:41:07,089
you don't play the rules like the way

1119
00:41:04,809 --> 00:41:08,529
you're supposed to there's a there's a

1120
00:41:07,089 --> 00:41:11,140
chance that they come back and say hey

1121
00:41:08,529 --> 00:41:12,339
the claims denied and then you might get

1122
00:41:11,140 --> 00:41:13,719
cranky about it but they're gonna say

1123
00:41:12,339 --> 00:41:15,460
but these were all the things you were

1124
00:41:13,719 --> 00:41:16,869
supposed to do and you're gonna say well

1125
00:41:15,460 --> 00:41:18,969
I didn't know that cuz the business got

1126
00:41:16,869 --> 00:41:20,410
the insurance how do I know doesn't

1127
00:41:18,969 --> 00:41:24,009
matter you have to follow these things

1128
00:41:20,410 --> 00:41:25,598
okay this is mine these aren't the IR

1129
00:41:24,009 --> 00:41:27,039
processes the incident response

1130
00:41:25,599 --> 00:41:29,140
processes you're looking for this is my

1131
00:41:27,039 --> 00:41:31,479
2016 reject talk but I thought I'd kind

1132
00:41:29,140 --> 00:41:34,150
of throw this slide in right so from an

1133
00:41:31,479 --> 00:41:35,618
incident response standpoint this is the

1134
00:41:34,150 --> 00:41:37,989
one that I want everyone to be really

1135
00:41:35,619 --> 00:41:39,759
really mindful of okay I think most

1136
00:41:37,989 --> 00:41:41,529
companies have focused on creating and

1137
00:41:39,759 --> 00:41:43,269
defining incident management teams and

1138
00:41:41,529 --> 00:41:44,950
processes it's been someone's been

1139
00:41:43,269 --> 00:41:48,129
talked about for a while I think we're

1140
00:41:44,950 --> 00:41:49,649
we're making great steps great progress

1141
00:41:48,130 --> 00:41:52,239
in that space I'm happy about that

1142
00:41:49,650 --> 00:41:53,680
and some of you in the room have had the

1143
00:41:52,239 --> 00:41:56,650
unfortunate opportunity to test out your

1144
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:59,890
IR processes right a breach some sort of

1145
00:41:56,650 --> 00:42:02,019
security event incident etc but when it

1146
00:41:59,890 --> 00:42:03,578
comes to cyber insurance there are a lot

1147
00:42:02,019 --> 00:42:06,308
of these processes that you have in

1148
00:42:03,579 --> 00:42:08,390
place that you like that you're used to

1149
00:42:06,309 --> 00:42:09,710
that may need to change

1150
00:42:08,390 --> 00:42:11,690
it may need a change of cyber insurance

1151
00:42:09,710 --> 00:42:13,520
in there and again it depends on the

1152
00:42:11,690 --> 00:42:14,960
carrier depends on the policy and their

1153
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:16,220
requirements but there's there's some

1154
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:19,130
things that you're used to from a

1155
00:42:16,220 --> 00:42:22,160
security person that may change as we've

1156
00:42:19,130 --> 00:42:25,070
talked about the claims process is sort

1157
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:27,350
of like a normal insurance policy right

1158
00:42:25,070 --> 00:42:29,450
so if there's an issue you got to tell

1159
00:42:27,350 --> 00:42:31,640
your insurance provider about it right

1160
00:42:29,450 --> 00:42:34,819
makes a lot of sense makes a lot of

1161
00:42:31,640 --> 00:42:36,890
sense from there you're gonna get

1162
00:42:34,820 --> 00:42:39,860
assigned and adjuster a claims person

1163
00:42:36,890 --> 00:42:41,779
right and in some carriers I've seen

1164
00:42:39,860 --> 00:42:43,670
old-school carriers where they say send

1165
00:42:41,780 --> 00:42:46,280
an email and someone will get back to

1166
00:42:43,670 --> 00:42:48,650
you that's not so great and we've seen

1167
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:50,480
others that have 800 numbers and and and

1168
00:42:48,650 --> 00:42:52,040
and better support for those things but

1169
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:53,870
you need you need to know that there's a

1170
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:55,580
process that you have to notify them and

1171
00:42:53,870 --> 00:42:57,740
then you're gonna get assigned someone

1172
00:42:55,580 --> 00:43:00,590
when you get assigned someone they start

1173
00:42:57,740 --> 00:43:02,779
to work the breach or the case it can

1174
00:43:00,590 --> 00:43:06,140
take several different paths depending

1175
00:43:02,780 --> 00:43:08,870
on what it is right I've seen situations

1176
00:43:06,140 --> 00:43:10,279
where a laptop goes missing and the

1177
00:43:08,870 --> 00:43:11,810
carrier is like okay we'll start to work

1178
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:13,850
on that but they're not gonna they're

1179
00:43:11,810 --> 00:43:15,830
not gonna jump crazy and and go

1180
00:43:13,850 --> 00:43:17,299
immediately do enough ton of things but

1181
00:43:15,830 --> 00:43:18,560
if you tell them there's you're down or

1182
00:43:17,300 --> 00:43:20,750
there's ransomware or those sorts of

1183
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:24,380
things quicker responses can happen so

1184
00:43:20,750 --> 00:43:28,130
it just sort of depends now all policies

1185
00:43:24,380 --> 00:43:31,310
have this reporting requirement and

1186
00:43:28,130 --> 00:43:32,750
they'll call it timely reporting okay a

1187
00:43:31,310 --> 00:43:34,460
lot of them will say hey within 30 days

1188
00:43:32,750 --> 00:43:36,530
you need to tell us some will say within

1189
00:43:34,460 --> 00:43:39,200
60 days there's some other ones that'll

1190
00:43:36,530 --> 00:43:40,850
say as soon as practicable whatever that

1191
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:42,910
can mean but they're basically saying

1192
00:43:40,850 --> 00:43:45,500
you got to tell us about this stuff okay

1193
00:43:42,910 --> 00:43:46,970
now what's uh what's interesting is if

1194
00:43:45,500 --> 00:43:48,590
you think about just in your personal

1195
00:43:46,970 --> 00:43:50,109
life if something happened to your home

1196
00:43:48,590 --> 00:43:52,430
or apartment or wherever you live and

1197
00:43:50,110 --> 00:43:54,020
there's some damage going on and you

1198
00:43:52,430 --> 00:43:55,700
decide yeah I'll get around to tell the

1199
00:43:54,020 --> 00:43:57,980
insurance person later and you tell them

1200
00:43:55,700 --> 00:43:59,120
like six months from now and damage that

1201
00:43:57,980 --> 00:44:00,680
it could have been cleaned up for

1202
00:43:59,120 --> 00:44:02,810
quickly and smalls now gotten really

1203
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:03,950
expensive you can understand why people

1204
00:44:02,810 --> 00:44:05,420
want to know about same thing with

1205
00:44:03,950 --> 00:44:08,629
carriers they want to know about stuff

1206
00:44:05,420 --> 00:44:10,700
as soon as possible now if you don't

1207
00:44:08,630 --> 00:44:12,470
notify them within this time frame

1208
00:44:10,700 --> 00:44:13,819
because again it is sort of a contract

1209
00:44:12,470 --> 00:44:15,589
they could tell you hey you didn't you

1210
00:44:13,820 --> 00:44:18,170
didn't report it in the time frame no

1211
00:44:15,590 --> 00:44:20,510
coverage so you need to understand this

1212
00:44:18,170 --> 00:44:21,860
now the other thing that happens is

1213
00:44:20,510 --> 00:44:24,200
there's a lot of concerns about

1214
00:44:21,860 --> 00:44:26,360
we'll call over-reporting you know in

1215
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:29,210
our industry a lot of times we're not

1216
00:44:26,360 --> 00:44:30,800
entirely sure how bad it is right you

1217
00:44:29,210 --> 00:44:32,960
know from an event to an incident to

1218
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:34,550
maybe a data breach we don't really know

1219
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:38,090
something's happen and we're not really

1220
00:44:34,550 --> 00:44:39,740
sure from my standpoint I think concerns

1221
00:44:38,090 --> 00:44:42,020
about over reporting are just a bit

1222
00:44:39,740 --> 00:44:43,640
overblown but if you are the kind of

1223
00:44:42,020 --> 00:44:46,310
person that is reporting to your carrier

1224
00:44:43,640 --> 00:44:48,259
like every little thing that happens the

1225
00:44:46,310 --> 00:44:49,640
carrier might say what's going on over

1226
00:44:48,260 --> 00:44:51,440
there all right something something's

1227
00:44:49,640 --> 00:44:53,060
bubbling over there but in general I

1228
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:54,290
think you want to err on the side of if

1229
00:44:53,060 --> 00:44:56,090
you think you've had a breach you think

1230
00:44:54,290 --> 00:44:59,810
about an issue you want to report it you

1231
00:44:56,090 --> 00:45:03,020
want to let them know now cyber

1232
00:44:59,810 --> 00:45:06,290
insurance can cover policies can cover

1233
00:45:03,020 --> 00:45:08,150
costs in typically two ways okay so it's

1234
00:45:06,290 --> 00:45:10,850
called reimbursement or it's called

1235
00:45:08,150 --> 00:45:12,950
pay on behalf pay on behalf is

1236
00:45:10,850 --> 00:45:15,940
definitely much more common now that's

1237
00:45:12,950 --> 00:45:18,919
that's what I see for the most part and

1238
00:45:15,940 --> 00:45:20,690
in a lot of think it makes sense right

1239
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:22,670
because what's happening is a carrier

1240
00:45:20,690 --> 00:45:25,220
wants to pay this stuff off

1241
00:45:22,670 --> 00:45:27,380
as cheap as possible right that's what

1242
00:45:25,220 --> 00:45:28,490
they want to do and you want that happen

1243
00:45:27,380 --> 00:45:30,050
as well because if you're paying too

1244
00:45:28,490 --> 00:45:32,359
much money that may go over your limits

1245
00:45:30,050 --> 00:45:34,490
so this is good for both sides but in

1246
00:45:32,360 --> 00:45:36,230
order to do that they actually go out

1247
00:45:34,490 --> 00:45:37,640
and they they get these agreements in

1248
00:45:36,230 --> 00:45:40,070
place to try to get the lowest cost

1249
00:45:37,640 --> 00:45:41,569
possible okay so they want to control

1250
00:45:40,070 --> 00:45:43,160
things and they want to pay now the good

1251
00:45:41,570 --> 00:45:44,330
news is you know you're gonna have to

1252
00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:45,529
deal with anything that you know the

1253
00:45:44,330 --> 00:45:47,330
insurance carrier is going to pay all

1254
00:45:45,530 --> 00:45:50,510
the vendors and everyone directly so

1255
00:45:47,330 --> 00:45:53,540
that's that's fine but that means you

1256
00:45:50,510 --> 00:45:54,610
can't pick your vendors right you're not

1257
00:45:53,540 --> 00:45:59,029
gonna be able to pick who you work with

1258
00:45:54,610 --> 00:46:00,710
so if you've got an amazing vendor that

1259
00:45:59,030 --> 00:46:02,480
you've used for forensics or whatever it

1260
00:46:00,710 --> 00:46:03,680
may be and you want to use them there's

1261
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:06,220
gonna be some policies where you won't

1262
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:08,509
be able to use them right now the other

1263
00:46:06,220 --> 00:46:10,549
way that you cover cost is called

1264
00:46:08,510 --> 00:46:11,990
reimbursement and what I have seen at

1265
00:46:10,550 --> 00:46:14,480
this point there's only a few that are

1266
00:46:11,990 --> 00:46:17,120
still doing this but that's where you

1267
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:18,920
can pick your vendors you pay directly

1268
00:46:17,120 --> 00:46:20,440
with them hey go do this and then you

1269
00:46:18,920 --> 00:46:22,700
submit a reimbursement and you get paid

1270
00:46:20,440 --> 00:46:26,570
there's been a lot of cases that I have

1271
00:46:22,700 --> 00:46:29,270
seen where a company goes and picks

1272
00:46:26,570 --> 00:46:31,370
their you know family relatives IT

1273
00:46:29,270 --> 00:46:33,470
generic company and says hey I had an

1274
00:46:31,370 --> 00:46:34,259
issue come help me they're not security

1275
00:46:33,470 --> 00:46:36,209
experts

1276
00:46:34,260 --> 00:46:39,000
they bring them in they do forensics

1277
00:46:36,210 --> 00:46:40,530
sort of half-ass they pay and then guess

1278
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:42,510
what they didn't clean it up fully and

1279
00:46:40,530 --> 00:46:44,099
then things go sort of bad so I'm seeing

1280
00:46:42,510 --> 00:46:46,800
carriers that are sort of pulling away

1281
00:46:44,099 --> 00:46:48,930
from letting you know a company decide

1282
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:50,790
who they work with if this is important

1283
00:46:48,930 --> 00:46:55,109
to you you need to understand this

1284
00:46:50,790 --> 00:46:56,910
okay now panels and I'm not talking

1285
00:46:55,109 --> 00:47:00,420
about horrible panels on a station wagon

1286
00:46:56,910 --> 00:47:02,368
or my picture of a death panel what I'm

1287
00:47:00,420 --> 00:47:05,849
really talking about is keeping those

1288
00:47:02,369 --> 00:47:07,470
prices down okay they want to respond to

1289
00:47:05,849 --> 00:47:10,170
a claim they want to keep those prices

1290
00:47:07,470 --> 00:47:12,270
down and they're working with vendors to

1291
00:47:10,170 --> 00:47:14,970
negotiate these rates if you have a

1292
00:47:12,270 --> 00:47:16,560
breach and you call up a firm or a

1293
00:47:14,970 --> 00:47:17,970
security firm and say hey I just had a

1294
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:18,779
horrible problem can you get here as

1295
00:47:17,970 --> 00:47:20,459
soon as possible

1296
00:47:18,780 --> 00:47:22,980
are you gonna be able to negotiate the

1297
00:47:20,460 --> 00:47:25,770
best rate at that point now you're just

1298
00:47:22,980 --> 00:47:27,480
hoping they show up right and cost can

1299
00:47:25,770 --> 00:47:29,490
get out of control so what carriers are

1300
00:47:27,480 --> 00:47:31,050
doing is they're negotiating with these

1301
00:47:29,490 --> 00:47:34,290
vendors ahead of time and saying hey if

1302
00:47:31,050 --> 00:47:36,750
you want all of our business I need your

1303
00:47:34,290 --> 00:47:37,710
best rate and I need a really good rate

1304
00:47:36,750 --> 00:47:39,869
and then I'm gonna give you all this

1305
00:47:37,710 --> 00:47:41,910
business and they're doing it from a

1306
00:47:39,869 --> 00:47:44,970
legal counsel standpoint to get lawyer

1307
00:47:41,910 --> 00:47:47,040
costs down then any security vendors

1308
00:47:44,970 --> 00:47:48,959
forensics PR all that sort of stuff and

1309
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:51,720
we're seeing more and more of these

1310
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:53,130
proactive services right these things

1311
00:47:51,720 --> 00:47:54,779
that you can get ahead of time now a

1312
00:47:53,130 --> 00:47:56,640
carrier is not gonna recommend that you

1313
00:47:54,780 --> 00:47:58,560
go use this exact security provider

1314
00:47:56,640 --> 00:47:59,848
because if they did and something went

1315
00:47:58,560 --> 00:48:01,470
wrong you could go back to them and say

1316
00:47:59,849 --> 00:48:03,150
well you told me to use them and I got

1317
00:48:01,470 --> 00:48:04,980
breached and it's your fault so they'll

1318
00:48:03,150 --> 00:48:06,450
they'll try to negotiate and say here

1319
00:48:04,980 --> 00:48:08,010
are some things you could decide to do

1320
00:48:06,450 --> 00:48:12,540
but they're trying to get these better

1321
00:48:08,010 --> 00:48:14,310
rates for you okay now I think this is a

1322
00:48:12,540 --> 00:48:16,529
great thing because it in strict it can

1323
00:48:14,310 --> 00:48:19,619
stretch that insurance dollar right so

1324
00:48:16,530 --> 00:48:21,210
if you get a better rate then you're

1325
00:48:19,619 --> 00:48:23,839
gonna be able to stretch it further I

1326
00:48:21,210 --> 00:48:26,490
think it's a really good thing that we

1327
00:48:23,839 --> 00:48:27,660
we need to be mindful of now if you have

1328
00:48:26,490 --> 00:48:29,009
a vendor you really care about you can

1329
00:48:27,660 --> 00:48:30,180
ask a lot of these carriers or their

1330
00:48:29,010 --> 00:48:31,619
brokers to say who are the vendors you

1331
00:48:30,180 --> 00:48:35,040
work with and you can see ahead of time

1332
00:48:31,619 --> 00:48:38,369
so you can talk about that huge concern

1333
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:39,900
just be careful about it risk management

1334
00:48:38,369 --> 00:48:42,829
services and this concept of what's

1335
00:48:39,900 --> 00:48:45,720
called by a lot of people a breach coach

1336
00:48:42,829 --> 00:48:46,860
again you can have a portal they'll give

1337
00:48:45,720 --> 00:48:48,419
this free portal where you can

1338
00:48:46,860 --> 00:48:51,180
assessments and all these sorts of

1339
00:48:48,420 --> 00:48:52,830
things they even may require you to

1340
00:48:51,180 --> 00:48:55,620
submit your claim through that so you

1341
00:48:52,830 --> 00:48:57,870
need to be mindful of it okay they may

1342
00:48:55,620 --> 00:48:59,850
require that you select a breach coach

1343
00:48:57,870 --> 00:49:02,040
and that's the first person that you

1344
00:48:59,850 --> 00:49:03,690
talk to now when I first started hearing

1345
00:49:02,040 --> 00:49:04,860
this whole breach coach concept it

1346
00:49:03,690 --> 00:49:06,930
really annoyed me because it was a

1347
00:49:04,860 --> 00:49:09,300
lawyer and as a security person I

1348
00:49:06,930 --> 00:49:10,740
thought if I have a problem I want to

1349
00:49:09,300 --> 00:49:12,750
talk to a security person about what we

1350
00:49:10,740 --> 00:49:14,069
should do to resolve this but a lot of

1351
00:49:12,750 --> 00:49:16,350
lawyers are the first point of contact

1352
00:49:14,070 --> 00:49:18,420
and I've come around that it's not a bad

1353
00:49:16,350 --> 00:49:20,100
idea because you get privileged and so

1354
00:49:18,420 --> 00:49:21,750
you can start to have conversations

1355
00:49:20,100 --> 00:49:23,580
about this stuff under legal privilege

1356
00:49:21,750 --> 00:49:25,320
which isn't too bad and then from there

1357
00:49:23,580 --> 00:49:27,420
understand what it looks like from a

1358
00:49:25,320 --> 00:49:30,210
legal standpoint bring those security

1359
00:49:27,420 --> 00:49:31,410
vendors in that as you need you just got

1360
00:49:30,210 --> 00:49:33,180
to make sure you know the process before

1361
00:49:31,410 --> 00:49:34,589
you need to use it that's the biggest

1362
00:49:33,180 --> 00:49:36,450
thing that everyone needs to know if

1363
00:49:34,590 --> 00:49:39,420
there's a reporting process you got to

1364
00:49:36,450 --> 00:49:41,339
know what it is so to me with the rise

1365
00:49:39,420 --> 00:49:43,110
of cyber insurance is clear responders

1366
00:49:41,340 --> 00:49:45,360
they need to know how this impacts them

1367
00:49:43,110 --> 00:49:47,910
I think for the most part everyone's

1368
00:49:45,360 --> 00:49:49,350
focused on quick response and getting

1369
00:49:47,910 --> 00:49:52,560
things back up and running and all those

1370
00:49:49,350 --> 00:49:54,990
sorts of things the insurance policy can

1371
00:49:52,560 --> 00:49:56,460
put a little wrench in the middle right

1372
00:49:54,990 --> 00:49:57,569
because you need to make sure that

1373
00:49:56,460 --> 00:50:00,180
you're not doing things that aren't

1374
00:49:57,570 --> 00:50:01,290
approved so it's reporting I still think

1375
00:50:00,180 --> 00:50:02,879
it's trying to get things done quickly

1376
00:50:01,290 --> 00:50:04,470
as possible but you need to be careful

1377
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:07,050
before you just make decisions if you

1378
00:50:04,470 --> 00:50:10,169
have an insurance policy in place all

1379
00:50:07,050 --> 00:50:11,970
right let's talk about some actions for

1380
00:50:10,170 --> 00:50:14,610
the for what I want to get everyone here

1381
00:50:11,970 --> 00:50:16,470
continue to invest in security for the

1382
00:50:14,610 --> 00:50:17,970
love of God I'm not saying stop doing

1383
00:50:16,470 --> 00:50:20,730
security and just get insurance that's

1384
00:50:17,970 --> 00:50:22,649
not the message okay now what concerns

1385
00:50:20,730 --> 00:50:25,230
me is that's what some people may hear

1386
00:50:22,650 --> 00:50:28,290
that's what some people may do and we

1387
00:50:25,230 --> 00:50:30,120
call this a moral hazard right so if you

1388
00:50:28,290 --> 00:50:32,279
say you know what it's gonna cost so

1389
00:50:30,120 --> 00:50:33,509
much to invest in security forget that

1390
00:50:32,280 --> 00:50:34,770
I'm not I'm not gonna do anything I'm

1391
00:50:33,510 --> 00:50:36,660
just getting the insurance policy I'm

1392
00:50:34,770 --> 00:50:39,570
gonna do nothing that's bad for

1393
00:50:36,660 --> 00:50:41,250
consumers it's bad for everyone we don't

1394
00:50:39,570 --> 00:50:43,320
want that okay

1395
00:50:41,250 --> 00:50:45,060
I hope what's going to happen is that

1396
00:50:43,320 --> 00:50:45,570
carriers continue to raise their

1397
00:50:45,060 --> 00:50:47,850
underwriting

1398
00:50:45,570 --> 00:50:50,100
levels where if you don't have basic

1399
00:50:47,850 --> 00:50:52,020
security in place right now you can't

1400
00:50:50,100 --> 00:50:54,690
get insurance but I see a lot of

1401
00:50:52,020 --> 00:50:56,040
companies that have like no no security

1402
00:50:54,690 --> 00:50:58,380
at all getting insurance so it's a very

1403
00:50:56,040 --> 00:51:00,600
interesting time you definitely want to

1404
00:50:58,380 --> 00:51:02,430
find a plan in case of a data breach

1405
00:51:00,600 --> 00:51:04,319
without a doubt you need to spend more

1406
00:51:02,430 --> 00:51:06,120
time understanding your exposures

1407
00:51:04,320 --> 00:51:08,220
what are those sorts of data that you

1408
00:51:06,120 --> 00:51:10,080
have amount of records what are those

1409
00:51:08,220 --> 00:51:11,609
first and third party things that we

1410
00:51:10,080 --> 00:51:13,190
talked about that could go wrong so you

1411
00:51:11,610 --> 00:51:15,720
can start thinking about the coverage

1412
00:51:13,190 --> 00:51:17,610
when you leave here and you get home and

1413
00:51:15,720 --> 00:51:19,169
you recover and catch up on your emails

1414
00:51:17,610 --> 00:51:21,000
do me a favor go find out if you have

1415
00:51:19,170 --> 00:51:22,170
insurance policy start asking the

1416
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:25,200
questions do we have one of those

1417
00:51:22,170 --> 00:51:26,460
policies and if you do start to learn

1418
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:29,069
about it right because what we've all

1419
00:51:26,460 --> 00:51:30,210
talked about if you don't have one or

1420
00:51:29,070 --> 00:51:31,740
you can't figure it out what I would

1421
00:51:30,210 --> 00:51:34,290
advise you to do is just to ask the

1422
00:51:31,740 --> 00:51:35,549
questions right determine review the

1423
00:51:34,290 --> 00:51:37,830
coverage that might be important you as

1424
00:51:35,550 --> 00:51:41,310
we've discussed many times see if you

1425
00:51:37,830 --> 00:51:42,840
can get a quote right find a broker talk

1426
00:51:41,310 --> 00:51:44,520
to that arm of your organization that's

1427
00:51:42,840 --> 00:51:46,590
doing insurance see if they'll get a

1428
00:51:44,520 --> 00:51:48,870
quote if it makes sense and it's the

1429
00:51:46,590 --> 00:51:51,090
right price awesome do it if it doesn't

1430
00:51:48,870 --> 00:51:52,980
no big deal for those that it will tell

1431
00:51:51,090 --> 00:51:55,320
me I did this five years ago and it was

1432
00:51:52,980 --> 00:51:58,230
horrible I get it

1433
00:51:55,320 --> 00:52:01,050
try to get right go check it out and see

1434
00:51:58,230 --> 00:52:02,580
how it how it comes back around I think

1435
00:52:01,050 --> 00:52:04,710
in general when I try to get my head

1436
00:52:02,580 --> 00:52:06,690
wrapped around this effective security

1437
00:52:04,710 --> 00:52:08,880
programs cost a lot of money there's

1438
00:52:06,690 --> 00:52:10,170
just no way around it I we were sitting

1439
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:11,520
another night I was trying to ask people

1440
00:52:10,170 --> 00:52:12,840
if you could only do one thing in

1441
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:14,790
security at your company what would it

1442
00:52:12,840 --> 00:52:15,990
be and everyone just sort of looked

1443
00:52:14,790 --> 00:52:19,529
blankly because they want to list out

1444
00:52:15,990 --> 00:52:21,479
all these things right so we're costing

1445
00:52:19,530 --> 00:52:23,970
money for security but we know they can

1446
00:52:21,480 --> 00:52:25,890
still be compromised cyber liability is

1447
00:52:23,970 --> 00:52:29,220
cheaper than most of the security

1448
00:52:25,890 --> 00:52:31,560
controls right so while there are

1449
00:52:29,220 --> 00:52:33,240
gotchas there are legit players out

1450
00:52:31,560 --> 00:52:35,130
there that have coverage and services as

1451
00:52:33,240 --> 00:52:37,049
we've talked about so if you're in

1452
00:52:35,130 --> 00:52:38,610
charge of security or seaso and you have

1453
00:52:37,050 --> 00:52:40,080
something that goes wrong if you thought

1454
00:52:38,610 --> 00:52:42,030
you were unbreakable and then it turns

1455
00:52:40,080 --> 00:52:43,110
out that you're you weren't what do you

1456
00:52:42,030 --> 00:52:44,940
want to do do you want to say whoops

1457
00:52:43,110 --> 00:52:47,850
sorry about that I thought we had that

1458
00:52:44,940 --> 00:52:48,960
under control or do you want to say hey

1459
00:52:47,850 --> 00:52:51,000
we got a partner

1460
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:54,510
we've got coverage we've got a plan and

1461
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:55,560
file a claim and go from there I still

1462
00:52:54,510 --> 00:52:56,730
think it's a clear need for all

1463
00:52:55,560 --> 00:52:58,620
organizations to have an incident

1464
00:52:56,730 --> 00:53:00,120
response plan don't get me wrong having

1465
00:52:58,620 --> 00:53:02,549
it in place before you need to use it

1466
00:53:00,120 --> 00:53:05,720
etc but what's really interesting about

1467
00:53:02,550 --> 00:53:08,220
these cyber carriers as they're maturing

1468
00:53:05,720 --> 00:53:10,649
they're handling a lot more claims and

1469
00:53:08,220 --> 00:53:13,410
they're paying more claims okay so it's

1470
00:53:10,650 --> 00:53:14,270
not their first rodeo when that call

1471
00:53:13,410 --> 00:53:16,520
comes in we think

1472
00:53:14,270 --> 00:53:17,660
we've been hacked right and for many of

1473
00:53:16,520 --> 00:53:19,640
your organization's hopefully you

1474
00:53:17,660 --> 00:53:21,620
haven't had that call yet or just a few

1475
00:53:19,640 --> 00:53:23,960
but the carriers are starting to see a

1476
00:53:21,620 --> 00:53:26,420
lot of this stuff so that response

1477
00:53:23,960 --> 00:53:28,520
aspect then being a partner I think is

1478
00:53:26,420 --> 00:53:30,200
really key right those negotiated rates

1479
00:53:28,520 --> 00:53:32,390
now one of the things that I also like

1480
00:53:30,200 --> 00:53:34,220
to let's say let's say you really need a

1481
00:53:32,390 --> 00:53:35,629
hundred million dollars insurance but

1482
00:53:34,220 --> 00:53:38,060
it's just too expensive for you right

1483
00:53:35,630 --> 00:53:40,610
now and you get a million dollars I'd

1484
00:53:38,060 --> 00:53:42,500
rather you get a smaller policy and have

1485
00:53:40,610 --> 00:53:44,900
that partner because after your

1486
00:53:42,500 --> 00:53:47,630
insurance dollars are gone you can then

1487
00:53:44,900 --> 00:53:49,820
go ahead and still continue to use their

1488
00:53:47,630 --> 00:53:51,620
services at the right rates alright I

1489
00:53:49,820 --> 00:53:52,640
think that's it there are a lot of

1490
00:53:51,620 --> 00:53:54,680
people out there that could care less

1491
00:53:52,640 --> 00:53:56,450
about security and responses and they

1492
00:53:54,680 --> 00:53:57,919
just wanna who you gonna call and the

1493
00:53:56,450 --> 00:53:59,359
insurance stuff gives you that so I

1494
00:53:57,920 --> 00:54:01,340
really appreciate it thanks for

1495
00:53:59,360 --> 00:54:02,990
listening all that I'll stick around for

1496
00:54:01,340 --> 00:54:04,910
questions I hope you guys enjoy the

1497
00:54:02,990 --> 00:54:05,959
summit thanks Jeremiah and Robert for

1498
00:54:04,910 --> 00:54:07,450
putting this together I think it's great

1499
00:54:05,960 --> 00:54:10,290
stuff okay

1500
