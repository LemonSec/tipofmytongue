1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,470
the talk that you're seeing today is

2
00:00:01,589 --> 00:00:07,500
making things better the dead cow way

3
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:10,110
with a Joe Delta hug mud and death

4
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:12,150
veggie a couple things that we need to

5
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:13,768
get out the way real quick do stop ID

6
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:15,450
level two and make sure you stop by and

7
00:00:13,769 --> 00:00:17,130
give the vendors a little love before

8
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:20,369
you leave and we do have the black hat

9
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:24,180
Arsenal on level two as well so I

10
00:00:20,369 --> 00:00:38,250
introduced the stars those stars of the

11
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:40,730
show to you here you go so lead Zafar

12
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:40,730
one blank

13
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:59,710
hi everybody thanks for coming this is

14
00:00:50,470 --> 00:01:01,030
the cult of the dead cow talk I'm very

15
00:00:59,710 --> 00:01:02,020
excited about this I've been waiting a

16
00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:03,940
long time for this

17
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:07,360
for these three years and I've never

18
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:10,360
been on stage with Mudge or mr. mr.

19
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:12,369
death vegetables formal name before so

20
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:17,710
quite excited about that and we have

21
00:01:12,369 --> 00:01:20,590
again Chris drew dill dog so just to set

22
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:22,240
the stage here a little bit I won't

23
00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:24,340
explain it's not obvious why somebody

24
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:28,119
would want to write a book about guys

25
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:31,330
that were really famous 20 years ago but

26
00:01:28,119 --> 00:01:34,660
it's but it's worth it because these

27
00:01:31,330 --> 00:01:38,440
guys go all the way back to before the

28
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:39,910
web was in in use and they're still

29
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:42,640
around and they've been through these

30
00:01:39,910 --> 00:01:43,119
amazing evolutions completely different

31
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,590
phases

32
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:47,710
it's funny when I've been talking to

33
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:49,990
people some people say like you know I

34
00:01:47,710 --> 00:01:51,820
owe ya the CDC you know when I first

35
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:53,679
started hacking I used Bo and it was

36
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:55,330
awesome and you know somebody else is a

37
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:58,840
little older say oh yeah like the first

38
00:01:55,330 --> 00:02:00,250
text files ever saw or CDC and it just

39
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:02,380
it just keeps going and not even

40
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:03,729
everybody in CDC knows all the

41
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:07,119
interesting things that they got up to

42
00:02:03,729 --> 00:02:09,100
over the years but I think it's really

43
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:10,899
important now as the as the tech

44
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:14,769
industry appears to have lost a bit of

45
00:02:10,899 --> 00:02:16,090
its moral bearings to go back and learn

46
00:02:14,769 --> 00:02:18,489
from people who are really good at

47
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:20,860
critical thinking who are trying to do

48
00:02:18,489 --> 00:02:23,890
good for the world and who are willing

49
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:25,989
to explore new areas where they didn't

50
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:29,048
have expertise but keep their their core

51
00:02:25,989 --> 00:02:30,970
values so without further ado I'm just

52
00:02:29,049 --> 00:02:33,160
gonna sit over there and I'm gonna talk

53
00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:34,720
to these amazing gentlemen and we'll

54
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:36,640
have time for Q&A at the end if you go

55
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:39,430
to the mics it is recorded so be aware

56
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:41,640
that use your handles if you want thanks

57
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:41,640
a lot

58
00:02:46,970 --> 00:02:52,440
so to begin with mr. vegetable doctor

59
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,629
vegetable hair - doc hair doctor

60
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:56,430
professor for the first time will you

61
00:02:54,629 --> 00:02:58,260
tell the assembled masses what your

62
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:59,790
actual name is and what you do for the

63
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:01,829
don't do it it's really weird man it's

64
00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:04,410
weird you know I spent 30-plus years

65
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:06,299
like you know all finely honed instincts

66
00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:08,220
to avoid science but my name is a Luke

67
00:03:06,299 --> 00:03:10,260
Ben fry I am the head of operations and

68
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:13,709
information security at cloud IQ limited

69
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:18,840
in the UK so there you have it so on the

70
00:03:13,709 --> 00:03:22,440
record so now that would call you Luke

71
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:24,299
tell us tell us about your early your

72
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:26,340
early interest in CDC how did you find

73
00:03:24,299 --> 00:03:29,430
out about them what did you think of

74
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:31,230
them and what was it what was the the

75
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:33,720
short version of what the culture was

76
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:35,760
like at the time back in the in the

77
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:37,650
early 1990s and this is actually goes

78
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:40,679
back to the late 80s but you know it was

79
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:43,230
a you know I was you know the weird kid

80
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:45,269
in a small town didn't really have any

81
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:47,010
but I could relate to I didn't really

82
00:03:45,269 --> 00:03:49,760
think that there would be anybody out

83
00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:51,870
there like me and then I started to find

84
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:54,030
you know BBS's

85
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:57,359
I actually in a visit with a cousin out

86
00:03:54,030 --> 00:04:00,120
in California he gave me a floppy drive

87
00:03:57,359 --> 00:04:02,310
a floppy disk that had some early issue

88
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:04,980
of frack on it this sort of been like 87

89
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:07,139
or 88 and then I started calling around

90
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:08,190
BBS as I would see you know references

91
00:04:07,139 --> 00:04:10,709
of the cult of the dead cow because

92
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:12,660
they'd been around since 84 and and

93
00:04:10,709 --> 00:04:15,389
other in other groups and then start

94
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:16,978
calling other boards start you know you

95
00:04:15,389 --> 00:04:18,870
know exchanging messages with people and

96
00:04:16,978 --> 00:04:22,710
then eventually cuz I was also into

97
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:24,450
phone phreaking and you know nascent

98
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:26,669
computer hacking mostly to be able to

99
00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:28,860
call other bulletin boards to get to

100
00:04:26,669 --> 00:04:31,469
global out tiles and things I would set

101
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:33,410
up teleconferences for CDC members and

102
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:35,820
eventually someone sponsored me to join

103
00:04:33,410 --> 00:04:37,260
but for me because these were the people

104
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:38,639
that had been there before me and I was

105
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:40,440
like oh my god you know I've seen your

106
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:42,300
work forever so it was really I felt

107
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:45,990
extremely honored to be invited to join

108
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:48,930
so in addition to the often very funny

109
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:51,599
text files frequently profane text files

110
00:04:48,930 --> 00:04:53,490
that were brilliantly marketed and

111
00:04:51,599 --> 00:04:56,430
circulated widely on the semi

112
00:04:53,490 --> 00:04:57,430
underground CDC also brought us the

113
00:04:56,430 --> 00:05:00,940
modern aking

114
00:04:57,430 --> 00:05:03,310
mentioned which began is Xmas Con and

115
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:06,219
was cleverly shortened to ho ho con

116
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:08,980
because his over Christmas break tell us

117
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:10,510
what it was like going to I mean it

118
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:12,520
would you know compared to this it was

119
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:16,510
unrecognizable or even DEF CON nowadays

120
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:19,180
imagine like just some random motel in

121
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:19,960
in either the sometimes out near the

122
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:21,490
airport

123
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:23,140
you know the Airport Marriott in in

124
00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:25,240
Austin Texas or something

125
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:27,039
Austin you know they had no idea that

126
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:28,120
hackers were coming because drunk bucks

127
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:29,880
who would arrange it would be like oh

128
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:34,540
it's a computer enthusiasts convention

129
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:37,960
bad guys handle yeah Jesse Dryden

130
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:39,840
so one result of that is that we could

131
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:42,070
never have it in the same hotel twice

132
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:44,590
because it was it was crazy I mean you

133
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:46,960
have kids drunk you know they're you

134
00:05:44,590 --> 00:05:49,390
know great stories like the the hotel

135
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:51,609
manager like running up to Jesse and and

136
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:55,659
be like they're burning a Bible in the

137
00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:56,710
parking lot like you know they just

138
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:59,800
didn't know what they were getting into

139
00:05:56,710 --> 00:06:01,450
but it was you know it was there had

140
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:03,100
been conferences before but those were

141
00:06:01,450 --> 00:06:05,770
pure parties whereas this was the first

142
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:07,750
one that both invited not just hackers

143
00:06:05,770 --> 00:06:10,479
but people from law enforcement and

144
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:12,670
things like that and had speakers they

145
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:15,610
actually had presentations on on either

146
00:06:12,670 --> 00:06:17,950
cultural things or or specifically

147
00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:22,630
hacking things etc six million dollar

148
00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:25,990
man or man ho yeah so uh Mudge you you

149
00:06:22,630 --> 00:06:28,090
you went to least one yeah so is that

150
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:30,100
not always the first ones but at least

151
00:06:28,090 --> 00:06:32,200
the second one here in 93 and maybe a

152
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:33,670
little earlier even with the white

153
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:35,680
knight and Omega and everybody else

154
00:06:33,670 --> 00:06:36,880
brought me all right so I was there for

155
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:41,050
the Six Million Dollar Man UFOs

156
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:45,100
brilliant yeah so SSP this brief

157
00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:47,830
background CDC started in Lubbock Texas

158
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:53,080
home of Buddy Holly and probably more

159
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:55,630
relevantly Texas Tech MRMC CDT and and

160
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:57,820
then there was this influx of people

161
00:06:55,630 --> 00:06:59,350
from Boston including actually all three

162
00:06:57,820 --> 00:07:01,780
of these guys there was people were

163
00:06:59,350 --> 00:07:04,060
there in college people from there and

164
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:05,409
it sort of it started I was kind of like

165
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:07,720
the liberal arts wing in the hacker on

166
00:07:05,410 --> 00:07:09,910
the ground and then actual serious tech

167
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:10,660
people came to ho-ho con and some of

168
00:07:09,910 --> 00:07:14,620
them got

169
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:16,360
sucked into CDC including ultimately for

170
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:17,920
members of the loft including both these

171
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:20,800
two gentlemen so let's talk a little bit

172
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:23,470
about the loft which probably most

173
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:25,960
people heard of but Mudge alias Peters

174
00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:30,550
echo how did you come come across the

175
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:31,900
law it turns out that I had ended up

176
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:34,690
getting most of the loft guys their

177
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:36,400
first daytime jobs Bryan Holaday

178
00:07:34,690 --> 00:07:38,200
no bra yeah Brian oblivion had worked in

179
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:40,719
like store 24s beforehand and brought

180
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:42,490
him over to BBN and white night over at

181
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:44,140
video logic and all that you ain't just

182
00:07:42,490 --> 00:07:45,670
I started hanging around these folks and

183
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:46,990
I like them so I want to do nice things

184
00:07:45,670 --> 00:07:48,910
for him and you know we're all

185
00:07:46,990 --> 00:07:51,220
technically like mine and they started

186
00:07:48,910 --> 00:07:53,680
to invite me to certain areas and you

187
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:55,000
know the loft you know kind of add more

188
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:58,000
if it was just a place where people had

189
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:59,940
were storing equipment and and some

190
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,350
other stuff but what attracted me was

191
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:04,870
these things called security advisories

192
00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:06,910
we're just starting to come out you know

193
00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:11,230
as the whole you know movement of full

194
00:08:06,910 --> 00:08:14,410
disclosure and you got the ability to

195
00:08:11,230 --> 00:08:16,720
literally bring data to the table scare

196
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:19,600
the shit out of folks and get big

197
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:21,580
companies to move and respond to it and

198
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:23,830
that was extremely you know powerful and

199
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:26,080
it was inspiring and I kind of had a

200
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:28,750
vision for the loft guys you know liked

201
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:31,510
that and you know glommed on to it and

202
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:34,090
you know the rest is history is a fact

203
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:39,520
and here we all are at a forty thousand

204
00:08:34,090 --> 00:08:42,910
people attend so uh all right so the big

205
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:44,530
change comes with Windows 95 VIP yeah

206
00:08:42,909 --> 00:08:47,670
going into Windows which wasn't exactly

207
00:08:44,530 --> 00:08:50,290
you know ready for it all using special

208
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:54,430
CEC members heuristic put out back

209
00:08:50,290 --> 00:08:55,810
office 21 years ago at DEFCON yeah and

210
00:08:54,430 --> 00:08:58,030
then Microsoft you said isn't

211
00:08:55,810 --> 00:08:59,650
opportunity to upsell it's like well

212
00:08:58,030 --> 00:09:01,870
there's nothing to worry about but if

213
00:08:59,650 --> 00:09:05,530
you're really really concerned you can

214
00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:08,080
buy our brand spanking new Windows NT

215
00:09:05,530 --> 00:09:10,300
Windows 2000 yeah

216
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:12,280
and that's totally secure because that's

217
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:16,479
totally secure and because it's not Unix

218
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:17,829
oh yes Christian Roo you probably

219
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:20,970
figured at the time well that's that's

220
00:09:17,830 --> 00:09:22,839
more secure so we just let it ride right

221
00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:25,000
take their word for it they know what

222
00:09:22,839 --> 00:09:26,589
they're doing yeah I had already started

223
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,120
looking at the early betas of Windows

224
00:09:26,589 --> 00:09:30,220
2000 when they were starting to make

225
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:33,310
those plans obviously having played with

226
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:35,380
back orifice and when we noticed that a

227
00:09:33,310 --> 00:09:37,359
lot of the techniques that the original

228
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:40,300
back orifice was using would not

229
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:43,300
necessarily port cleanly over to Windows

230
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:45,639
2000 it made sense to try to see how

231
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:47,189
much of that we could build for what

232
00:09:45,639 --> 00:09:50,470
would become the next generation of

233
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:54,550
server class operating systems from from

234
00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:56,680
from Microsoft and it turned out that

235
00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:59,439
just about all of the functionality that

236
00:09:56,680 --> 00:10:01,269
you could you know do with Windows 95

237
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:02,800
you could do with 2000 despite the fact

238
00:10:01,269 --> 00:10:04,269
that you didn't necessarily have

239
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:07,089
administrative access we didn't really

240
00:10:04,269 --> 00:10:08,440
need it the windows API was so rich that

241
00:10:07,089 --> 00:10:10,480
you could get away with just about

242
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:14,709
anything imaginable without even having

243
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:16,690
an admin account so it's a feature it

244
00:10:14,709 --> 00:10:20,170
was pretty much baffling to me that you

245
00:10:16,690 --> 00:10:22,089
know you could do things like like you

246
00:10:20,170 --> 00:10:24,099
know launch a process that opens up the

247
00:10:22,089 --> 00:10:25,839
process space of another process and

248
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:27,730
then allocates memory and it copies

249
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:29,470
itself into that process and then

250
00:10:27,730 --> 00:10:31,899
basically disappears from the process

251
00:10:29,470 --> 00:10:34,510
table I mean and it just continues to

252
00:10:31,899 --> 00:10:36,449
run as a threat of like explorer.exe the

253
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:40,000
fact that any of that was even possible

254
00:10:36,449 --> 00:10:43,540
was so baffling that I just had to try

255
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:45,279
to figure out how to you know you know

256
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:48,010
what what what api's could I get my

257
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:51,610
hands on it was just so rich you know

258
00:10:48,010 --> 00:10:54,189
getting them to acknowledge that there

259
00:10:51,610 --> 00:10:56,589
were security vulnerabilities because of

260
00:10:54,190 --> 00:10:59,319
the sort of lack of controls they had at

261
00:10:56,589 --> 00:11:01,720
the time was the reason really for be

262
00:10:59,319 --> 00:11:04,120
fgk thanks they also egged us on to it

263
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:06,399
because they came out and said our

264
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:07,810
passwords are uncrackable it would take

265
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:09,490
hundreds of millions of years so he

266
00:11:07,810 --> 00:11:12,099
wrote lost crack demonstrated takes

267
00:11:09,490 --> 00:11:13,720
about 48 hours and then they said the

268
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:16,180
buffer overflows don't work in Windows

269
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:17,949
yeah which we've just never understood

270
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:19,388
what the hell they were talking about so

271
00:11:17,949 --> 00:11:20,589
there were advisories for all of these

272
00:11:19,389 --> 00:11:22,449
yes I mean there's and then they even

273
00:11:20,589 --> 00:11:25,750
came over and offered the loft source

274
00:11:22,449 --> 00:11:27,270
code to Windows NT and this was a cron

275
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:29,040
kana and

276
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:30,930
yeah and you know we looked at it more

277
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:32,819
like we don't need the source code and I

278
00:11:30,930 --> 00:11:36,089
bet you want us to sign an NDA don't you

279
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:37,710
yeah you're on to us yeah it was this

280
00:11:36,090 --> 00:11:39,930
weird sort of game where we really felt

281
00:11:37,710 --> 00:11:41,040
encouraged to be like the oh you're

282
00:11:39,930 --> 00:11:42,930
gonna you're gonna play cat-and-mouse

283
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:45,930
with us this is great you're engaging us

284
00:11:42,930 --> 00:11:47,910
a four-person five person shop on a

285
00:11:45,930 --> 00:11:53,099
grand scale - back and forth where you

286
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:54,719
know it was like oh no that's not a

287
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:57,810
problem because this is miss and we just

288
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:59,670
had a point my point so let's talk about

289
00:11:57,810 --> 00:12:02,819
like this or the social dynamic at the

290
00:11:59,670 --> 00:12:04,650
time now loft you know even even loft

291
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:07,020
which was essentially a good cop to the

292
00:12:04,650 --> 00:12:08,970
CBC's bad cop or you know even even then

293
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:10,260
you guys were using handles you know

294
00:12:08,970 --> 00:12:12,150
rather than your real names it was still

295
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:14,220
pretty dicey just intuitive point

296
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:16,650
publicly point out pulls in people's

297
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:18,330
products yeah we have lots of lawsuits

298
00:12:16,650 --> 00:12:21,300
trying trying to come after us we had

299
00:12:18,330 --> 00:12:23,370
the FBI sent at one point this is RSA uh

300
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:25,740
it was called security dynamics at the

301
00:12:23,370 --> 00:12:29,070
time retro actively name you know we're

302
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:31,530
all friends with Ramiro men Rivest

303
00:12:29,070 --> 00:12:33,360
Shamir and Adleman yeah yeah it got

304
00:12:31,530 --> 00:12:37,380
pretty nasty so you didn't always want

305
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:40,440
your name out there so tell me tell me

306
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:42,510
Chris like why why put out bo TK under

307
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:45,030
you were actually working for the law if

308
00:12:42,510 --> 00:12:46,830
you're the first boy yes exactly

309
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:50,400
no I put out the loft paint him to

310
00:12:46,830 --> 00:12:52,560
create it why did I feel 2 K as CDC with

311
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:54,360
the big villain act and the tossing the

312
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:56,609
CJ's and the costumes and the rapping

313
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:58,650
rather than just do something formal and

314
00:12:56,610 --> 00:13:03,420
proper through loft that's a good

315
00:12:58,650 --> 00:13:06,750
question um CDC had the original bo on

316
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:09,360
the brand right so yeah the brand was a

317
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:10,530
CDC brand there was enough overlap in

318
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:12,810
the two organizations that it made sense

319
00:13:10,530 --> 00:13:15,240
for me to spend my time doing that

320
00:13:12,810 --> 00:13:17,880
because it it kind of elevated both

321
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:20,970
organizations in some way it was good

322
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:23,339
publicity for the loft but you know it

323
00:13:20,970 --> 00:13:25,880
was being driven by CDC people to some

324
00:13:23,339 --> 00:13:28,260
extent CDC almost acted like a marketing

325
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:31,470
marketing department it proloft in that

326
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:33,210
way you know so for me because Shores

327
00:13:31,470 --> 00:13:36,630
are the stripe I'm having one foot on

328
00:13:33,210 --> 00:13:39,420
each iceberg or whatever it was it was a

329
00:13:36,630 --> 00:13:40,470
it was a good opportunity for me to to

330
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:42,120
get up

331
00:13:40,470 --> 00:13:43,440
do something extremely technical in

332
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:45,450
front of an audience that I might not

333
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:47,700
have been able to command otherwise you

334
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:48,690
know and that that was I raised the

335
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:50,070
level of discussion

336
00:13:48,690 --> 00:13:51,810
like I remember the conference it does

337
00:13:50,070 --> 00:13:54,810
it also had the turned into a media

338
00:13:51,810 --> 00:13:58,229
circus though that was a fun part you

339
00:13:54,810 --> 00:14:00,930
know was lighting up all the the media

340
00:13:58,230 --> 00:14:03,120
on this like you know you know we were

341
00:14:00,930 --> 00:14:05,880
viewing it as you know trying to make a

342
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:07,080
difference you know seeing that you know

343
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:08,939
we have this conversations internally

344
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:10,740
within the herd that look you know there

345
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:12,480
this is a real problem that this this

346
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:14,310
operating system is being pushed out to

347
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:16,380
everybody your grandmother and market it

348
00:14:14,310 --> 00:14:18,420
as like oh this is a safe way to engage

349
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:20,730
on the Internet and it was not safe and

350
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:22,709
just getting them to I mean it was

351
00:14:20,730 --> 00:14:24,450
relatively idealist to think like oh we

352
00:14:22,710 --> 00:14:25,410
can force them to change it but I mean

353
00:14:24,450 --> 00:14:26,910
that's what we thought we could do we

354
00:14:25,410 --> 00:14:28,260
you know oh they're gonna hear we're

355
00:14:26,910 --> 00:14:30,180
gonna highlight these problems and

356
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:31,410
they'll fix them not but what happened

357
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:33,209
is we highlighted these problems and

358
00:14:31,410 --> 00:14:35,370
they issued a press release I think the

359
00:14:33,210 --> 00:14:38,070
context here is that Windows Update did

360
00:14:35,370 --> 00:14:40,080
not exist at a time you don't don't

361
00:14:38,070 --> 00:14:41,760
let's not pretend that Microsoft just

362
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:44,430
rolled out patches all the time or even

363
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:46,350
had a disclosure process this was like

364
00:14:44,430 --> 00:14:48,750
once or twice a year there was a service

365
00:14:46,350 --> 00:14:50,280
pack or something and maybe your bug or

366
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:52,080
whatever got rolled into it so there

367
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:52,740
wasn't really a mechanism for them to

368
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:55,140
deal with this

369
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:56,910
it was denial in lawsuits and that kind

370
00:14:55,140 --> 00:14:59,730
of thing I got plenty of threats spin in

371
00:14:56,910 --> 00:15:01,500
a spin but you know part of why it went

372
00:14:59,730 --> 00:15:02,610
out of CDC rather than also we talked

373
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:04,170
about the society because we were

374
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:05,760
literally paying him to do it and we're

375
00:15:04,170 --> 00:15:07,469
like well why aren't we going to us loft

376
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:09,390
you know take some of the you know

377
00:15:07,470 --> 00:15:11,280
accolades or the excellent work that doe

378
00:15:09,390 --> 00:15:14,790
was doing and we realized it was an

379
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:17,100
opportunity to see how if we deliver the

380
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:19,920
same sort of data but just from two

381
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:21,090
different spins you know from CDC you

382
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:22,650
know versus the loss because we had

383
00:15:21,090 --> 00:15:24,510
advisories coming out of the law that

384
00:15:22,650 --> 00:15:27,510
here comes almost the same thing you

385
00:15:24,510 --> 00:15:29,160
know out of CDC is it is it received

386
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:31,260
differently you know how difficult is it

387
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:32,819
does it look bad does it look good you

388
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:34,860
know what's the long lasting part we

389
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:40,020
even did a professional plug-in pack if

390
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:41,910
you right yeah to try and say hey once

391
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:44,460
something has an initial spin of kind of

392
00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:46,620
quasi evil and questionable can you claw

393
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:48,750
it back and you know the answer was no

394
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:49,920
yeah nobody about the plug impact the

395
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:51,300
finality of the

396
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:54,630
spin you know that was a huge learning

397
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:56,609
lesson for us as to for the loft and for

398
00:15:54,630 --> 00:15:58,800
CDC and for what a lot of us did like

399
00:15:56,610 --> 00:16:00,510
kind of going forward was how do you

400
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:01,920
understand the information that you're

401
00:16:00,510 --> 00:16:04,350
presenting it and how you're initially

402
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:06,209
pitching it as to what its long lasting

403
00:16:04,350 --> 00:16:08,910
repercussions are going to do okay look

404
00:16:06,209 --> 00:16:10,260
I want to move past into like the 2000s

405
00:16:08,910 --> 00:16:13,139
when the spotlight starts to move away

406
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:15,839
we'll come back to hacktivism but in the

407
00:16:13,139 --> 00:16:17,699
meantime let's talk about at stake so in

408
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:19,170
retrospect it seems kind of weird to

409
00:16:17,699 --> 00:16:21,420
turn like this little like Hobby

410
00:16:19,170 --> 00:16:23,910
Boutique you know really cutting edge

411
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:25,469
with the advisories and coordinated

412
00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:27,180
disclosure pioneering all this great

413
00:16:25,470 --> 00:16:29,040
stuff necessary in Congress but then

414
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:30,479
taking some venture money and you know

415
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:33,240
try to make a buck even if that was like

416
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:37,560
the thing to do in 99 2000

417
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:39,420
what were the surveys amuses you sent

418
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:41,638
all these brilliant people inside big

419
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:43,649
companies who had never seen X hackers

420
00:16:41,639 --> 00:16:45,360
explaining stuff but nothing tell me

421
00:16:43,649 --> 00:16:50,160
from your guys perspective like the

422
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:52,139
highlights and lowlights and I'll think

423
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:54,000
I'll take the first you know which is

424
00:16:52,139 --> 00:16:55,740
you know I'm the one who pushed it in

425
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,019
there and you know on the surface it

426
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:59,550
seemed like you know we were aligned

427
00:16:58,019 --> 00:17:00,930
with the VCS and that they wanted the

428
00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:03,089
same things that we didn't we could turn

429
00:17:00,930 --> 00:17:04,319
our hobby into a day job and you know we

430
00:17:03,089 --> 00:17:06,000
liked our hobby it's more than we liked

431
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:08,639
our day jobs except for him who we were

432
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,349
already paying sort of stuff and you

433
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:12,120
know that was a really painful you know

434
00:17:10,349 --> 00:17:14,428
learning lesson that you know like no we

435
00:17:12,119 --> 00:17:16,500
weren't really aligned we wanted to kind

436
00:17:14,429 --> 00:17:18,089
of go from the garage band that had like

437
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:20,429
a small amount of people who were

438
00:17:18,089 --> 00:17:22,139
listening and really dug it to you know

439
00:17:20,429 --> 00:17:24,270
how do we get up on the big stage and

440
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:25,559
yeah our message might be muted we might

441
00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:27,389
have fun you know like you know make

442
00:17:25,559 --> 00:17:29,520
some given cakes and stuff but you know

443
00:17:27,390 --> 00:17:30,840
to a broader audience and there's a lot

444
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:32,730
of positives that came out of it almost

445
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:34,678
every one of the security consultancies

446
00:17:32,730 --> 00:17:37,140
you know for decades afterwards you'll

447
00:17:34,679 --> 00:17:39,210
can trace their lineage back there to

448
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:41,340
some extent but yeah yeah it was some

449
00:17:39,210 --> 00:17:43,460
you know we were a bit young but naive

450
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:48,120
and uh there were some hard loves there

451
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:51,960
yeah you know for me the highlights were

452
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:53,489
the opportunity to do focused security

453
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:56,250
research on things that might otherwise

454
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:57,840
not have an immediate impact I was able

455
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:59,670
to start building things that eventually

456
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:01,740
turned into very code

457
00:17:59,670 --> 00:18:04,110
that the research on decompilation

458
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:05,790
theory and software modeling and

459
00:18:04,110 --> 00:18:08,070
automated analysis and all of that

460
00:18:05,790 --> 00:18:10,110
binary analysis stuff that all really

461
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:11,460
started at at stake and it was funded

462
00:18:10,110 --> 00:18:13,800
through there it was originally gonna be

463
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:15,480
a bionic exoskeleton for consultants you

464
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:17,760
know who might want to be able to

465
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:20,550
analyze binaries by instead of my hand

466
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:22,890
by analyzing faster using a tool and

467
00:18:20,550 --> 00:18:24,659
eventually they got spun out after the

468
00:18:22,890 --> 00:18:26,520
acquisition of that stake so you know

469
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:28,380
for me it was about getting the

470
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:29,389
opportunity to do that research it might

471
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:31,650
not be able to do otherwise

472
00:18:29,390 --> 00:18:33,810
some of the others for the fringe things

473
00:18:31,650 --> 00:18:35,970
that I enjoyed were I say to enjoy it at

474
00:18:33,810 --> 00:18:40,080
the time I thought it sucked that I had

475
00:18:35,970 --> 00:18:41,370
to go to Microsoft to do audits and you

476
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:43,470
know what Microsoft was a customer of

477
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:45,330
add sticks so I had spent the majority

478
00:18:43,470 --> 00:18:47,790
of my career pulling Microsoft's pants

479
00:18:45,330 --> 00:18:49,649
down in public but now I was hired by

480
00:18:47,790 --> 00:18:55,260
them to go and pull their pants down in

481
00:18:49,650 --> 00:18:58,350
private which she was a strange honor I

482
00:18:55,260 --> 00:19:03,330
was on the team that that did the code

483
00:18:58,350 --> 00:19:04,860
reviews of I is six so once I is six

484
00:19:03,330 --> 00:19:08,699
came out we did it a whole ton of review

485
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:10,770
on that before seven and asp.net and a

486
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:12,660
bunch of other things you might be aware

487
00:19:10,770 --> 00:19:15,150
of you know we didn't I did a bunch of

488
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:17,160
those reviews with day by telling Frank

489
00:19:15,150 --> 00:19:19,830
swierski and others those are good

490
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:22,020
moments folks those are formative so

491
00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:23,610
what happens here is that the venture

492
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:25,920
math doesn't really work you know you

493
00:19:23,610 --> 00:19:27,810
don't get a hundred 100x returns from

494
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:30,660
consulting no matter with you if you're

495
00:19:27,810 --> 00:19:32,460
selling hours you got a 1x multiple yeah

496
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:34,020
and that's like this everybody that came

497
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:35,910
after at stake learned from how we

498
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:37,590
didn't succeed in that department I'll

499
00:19:35,910 --> 00:19:39,090
just briefly mention that I think one of

500
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:40,770
the great contributions is all the alums

501
00:19:39,090 --> 00:19:43,199
you know that came out of the area

502
00:19:40,770 --> 00:19:45,570
including people like Alex Stamos Katie

503
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:47,430
my source window Snider's amazing people

504
00:19:45,570 --> 00:19:49,860
worked at at stake and and it sort of it

505
00:19:47,430 --> 00:19:53,820
validated it for other small awesome

506
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:55,889
firms at the same at the same time so so

507
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:57,570
and so they're there that's the private

508
00:19:55,890 --> 00:19:59,880
sector and Bera code you know so is

509
00:19:57,570 --> 00:20:02,520
amazing legacy as well so that's the

510
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:04,070
private sector then then we have like

511
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:08,090
the nonprofit

512
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:09,950
hacktivism world where CBC also had

513
00:20:08,090 --> 00:20:11,330
tremendous influence now that was kind

514
00:20:09,950 --> 00:20:13,760
of an amazing shift I mean you guys were

515
00:20:11,330 --> 00:20:17,418
like the the peak of Fame in info sack

516
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:19,640
acronym 20 years ago and then somebody

517
00:20:17,419 --> 00:20:22,160
decides to turn it up another not so

518
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:24,080
Luke tell us a little bit about how the

519
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:26,650
whole hacktivism thing started well I

520
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:29,090
mean it was a the term was coined by a

521
00:20:26,650 --> 00:20:31,610
CDC member Omega who's actually here

522
00:20:29,090 --> 00:20:32,899
right now he's gonna be at the you know

523
00:20:31,610 --> 00:20:36,979
we're doing a presentation at Def Con on

524
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:39,860
tomorrow but uh you know we had had this

525
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:42,410
discussion about sort of as you know

526
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:43,879
hackers as people involved with computer

527
00:20:42,410 --> 00:20:45,500
underground you have this power you have

528
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:47,179
this influence so it's like what can we

529
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:49,190
do with this to try to make the world a

530
00:20:47,179 --> 00:20:51,559
better place where where can we leverage

531
00:20:49,190 --> 00:20:52,669
this power that we have and so one of

532
00:20:51,559 --> 00:20:55,820
the things that we thought about was

533
00:20:52,669 --> 00:20:58,040
both was was using that to you know both

534
00:20:55,820 --> 00:20:59,570
through the media and and you know

535
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:01,610
hopefully through some sort of like

536
00:20:59,570 --> 00:21:03,409
technology but but you know especially

537
00:21:01,610 --> 00:21:04,879
through through media and through the

538
00:21:03,410 --> 00:21:07,220
influence that we've gathered through

539
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:09,169
other through you know both our long

540
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:12,860
history and drew back or our crispy o2k

541
00:21:09,169 --> 00:21:15,590
etc our connections with the media and a

542
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:17,540
lot of this is influenced by oxblood

543
00:21:15,590 --> 00:21:18,949
Russell a member joined in the mid

544
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:20,780
nineties and he had a background he was

545
00:21:18,950 --> 00:21:24,140
older than the rest of us almost all the

546
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:27,350
rest of us and they've worked for the UN

547
00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:29,150
and you know had had worked for various

548
00:21:27,350 --> 00:21:31,580
human rights organizations and he came

549
00:21:29,150 --> 00:21:33,410
in and basically showed us a way that

550
00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:36,049
you know we'd already been looking for a

551
00:21:33,410 --> 00:21:40,250
way to influence and he kind of showed

552
00:21:36,049 --> 00:21:44,030
us how that helped us you know focus our

553
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:46,850
message and and you know brought us we

554
00:21:44,030 --> 00:21:52,520
appeared with Patrick ball and at Def

555
00:21:46,850 --> 00:21:54,918
Con in 2001 it doesn't 2001 on it and

556
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:59,000
did a panel on how computer security can

557
00:21:54,919 --> 00:22:04,090
be an encryption can be leveraged to

558
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:06,770
help human rights and activists within

559
00:22:04,090 --> 00:22:09,330
within dissident groups yeah yeah this

560
00:22:06,770 --> 00:22:11,639
is within there's resignations

561
00:22:09,330 --> 00:22:14,189
yeah yeah and the State Department State

562
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:15,300
Department likes that no the State

563
00:22:14,190 --> 00:22:17,220
Department likes that sort of manner

564
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:19,200
well they do now at the time it was

565
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:21,180
pretty it's pretty radical and you know

566
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:23,880
it's amazing we're still having the same

567
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:25,920
conversation now yeah this is where the

568
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:28,590
action is surveillance go surveillance

569
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:31,860
there was a bunch of CDC involvement its

570
00:22:28,590 --> 00:22:37,220
various points and with some of the

571
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:39,810
folks that prosecuted slobodan milosevic

572
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:41,460
for the crimes in newest lobby uh if you

573
00:22:39,810 --> 00:22:43,139
actually go these days if you go to the

574
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:45,000
International Criminal Court a former

575
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:46,530
Yugoslavia sweb site they have a website

576
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:49,110
where you can search through all of the

577
00:22:46,530 --> 00:22:50,340
the cases and all the transcripts if you

578
00:22:49,110 --> 00:22:52,949
go ahead and search for cult of the dead

579
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:55,350
cow and it is a tremendous amount of CDC

580
00:22:52,950 --> 00:22:57,480
references in the Slobodan Milosevic

581
00:22:55,350 --> 00:22:59,010
trial and vodka melodic and all the sins

582
00:22:57,480 --> 00:23:02,180
over the last 20 years

583
00:22:59,010 --> 00:23:04,650
CDC comes up a strange amount in these

584
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:06,630
proceedings it's a yeah I was baffled

585
00:23:04,650 --> 00:23:08,520
but most it was really weird to see the

586
00:23:06,630 --> 00:23:11,340
the footage because slobodan milosevic

587
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:12,690
acted as is a lawyer yeah we see this

588
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:14,730
like you know this footage and he's like

589
00:23:12,690 --> 00:23:29,610
whoa tell me more about this dead cow

590
00:23:14,730 --> 00:23:33,300
cult oh my god horrible brave so we of

591
00:23:29,610 --> 00:23:35,879
CDC there was influence on tour because

592
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:37,740
yeah they tried to do a privacy

593
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:39,930
protecting browser and it didn't it

594
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:41,700
didn't take off hugely but it was enough

595
00:23:39,930 --> 00:23:43,320
that Dingell dine and friends at Taurus

596
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:45,690
it you know what maybe we should bundle

597
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:47,850
a browser in here to I mean I think it

598
00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:49,620
was sort of a proto tor browser in some

599
00:23:47,850 --> 00:23:51,300
ways like it was you know we were trying

600
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:53,189
to do the same thing that the project

601
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:56,760
kind of collapsed under under the weight

602
00:23:53,190 --> 00:23:59,040
of personalities and but then tour took

603
00:23:56,760 --> 00:24:00,930
that concept and ran with it I mean I

604
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:03,510
don't know if they used any of the code

605
00:24:00,930 --> 00:24:04,890
base I'm not sure about that but there's

606
00:24:03,510 --> 00:24:07,220
something off of the Navy's original

607
00:24:04,890 --> 00:24:08,850
work on the Onion Routing solo yeah yeah

608
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:11,040
that was initially a

609
00:24:08,850 --> 00:24:12,629
government-sponsored yet again to allow

610
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:15,899
people to communicate and denied areas

611
00:24:12,630 --> 00:24:17,370
right all right so

612
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:20,100
a little bit just briefly near the

613
00:24:17,370 --> 00:24:22,439
definitions of hacktivism so I mean to

614
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:23,879
me one of the you know even CDC had a

615
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:25,560
couple different definitions but one of

616
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:28,110
them the one that resonates with me the

617
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:30,629
most was at you know security work and

618
00:24:28,110 --> 00:24:33,240
service of Human Rights and compare that

619
00:24:30,630 --> 00:24:36,420
to where you think activism has gone in

620
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:39,180
the last ten years well I mean I think

621
00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:41,100
that you certainly have hacktivism with

622
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:44,550
that you know with that in mind it's

623
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:46,830
still happening and I would certainly it

624
00:24:44,550 --> 00:24:49,020
I think that that definition is it is a

625
00:24:46,830 --> 00:24:50,580
completely valid one the question then

626
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:53,100
becomes what your what your definition

627
00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:55,409
of Human Rights is so is it focused to

628
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:57,149
just governmental you know interaction

629
00:24:55,410 --> 00:24:59,310
with humans is it civil liberties under

630
00:24:57,150 --> 00:25:02,730
governmental thing or is it actually

631
00:24:59,310 --> 00:25:05,159
also applicable to private companies

632
00:25:02,730 --> 00:25:06,600
private organizations and and some of us

633
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:08,040
believe that it is some of us believe

634
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:10,409
that it isn't I mean there there has

635
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:13,050
been there are still philosophical

636
00:25:10,410 --> 00:25:16,830
disagreements within CDC about what sort

637
00:25:13,050 --> 00:25:18,990
of actions are are ethically valid you

638
00:25:16,830 --> 00:25:22,530
know some people believe that things

639
00:25:18,990 --> 00:25:25,590
like denial of service or web defacement

640
00:25:22,530 --> 00:25:28,379
is not you know it is not applicable as

641
00:25:25,590 --> 00:25:30,120
a you know as a legitimate means of

642
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:32,220
protest other people believe that it is

643
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:35,699
a legitimate piece of you know form of

644
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:37,260
protests so these these are things that

645
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:40,470
are still going on and you know I don't

646
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:44,610
know I I don't necessarily think that

647
00:25:40,470 --> 00:25:47,280
the the kinds of of hacktivism have

648
00:25:44,610 --> 00:25:50,520
changed radically so much as the scale

649
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:52,940
has changed radically as access the

650
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:56,970
internet and access the Internet has as

651
00:25:52,940 --> 00:25:58,830
you know penetrated and and spread much

652
00:25:56,970 --> 00:25:59,970
more widely people around the globe will

653
00:25:58,830 --> 00:26:02,040
you have breakage you have people

654
00:25:59,970 --> 00:26:03,090
hacking and dumping stuff yes you doctor

655
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:04,740
saying it's under different moral

656
00:26:03,090 --> 00:26:07,889
reasons or pertain more but I mean that

657
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:09,080
is that always yes that's all that's

658
00:26:07,890 --> 00:26:10,999
know again

659
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:14,689
and admit that the the early some of the

660
00:26:10,999 --> 00:26:16,970
early hacktivism was reverse activism it

661
00:26:14,690 --> 00:26:18,230
was people who had hacked a website and

662
00:26:16,970 --> 00:26:20,570
then figured out what their cause was

663
00:26:18,230 --> 00:26:22,879
after yes you know I mean it was a lot

664
00:26:20,570 --> 00:26:24,168
of that it happens but that inspired

665
00:26:22,879 --> 00:26:26,149
people that are quite people good well

666
00:26:24,169 --> 00:26:28,249
wait a minute you know you know I

667
00:26:26,149 --> 00:26:31,969
figured a society wait what's he done

668
00:26:28,249 --> 00:26:35,600
wrong the opportunity to use that to

669
00:26:31,970 --> 00:26:36,980
spread a message became more clear once

670
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:39,168
people sort of doing it even if it was

671
00:26:36,980 --> 00:26:40,489
mostly about the hack and a little bit

672
00:26:39,169 --> 00:26:43,009
less about the message at the beginning

673
00:26:40,489 --> 00:26:46,009
it really caught on as an opportunity to

674
00:26:43,009 --> 00:26:48,019
change minds when you know you know you

675
00:26:46,009 --> 00:26:49,700
you break into something and in post

676
00:26:48,019 --> 00:26:51,879
your screen there's gonna be a lot of

677
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:53,779
attention on there the media fixers

678
00:26:51,879 --> 00:26:55,699
government's started to pick up all that

679
00:26:53,779 --> 00:26:58,029
on that you saw it you saw daxing of

680
00:26:55,700 --> 00:27:00,289
surkov allegedly by the Ukrainians

681
00:26:58,029 --> 00:27:02,239
against neo the Russian disinformation

682
00:27:00,289 --> 00:27:04,340
stuff years back I mean you saw the same

683
00:27:02,239 --> 00:27:06,889
size interesting Syrian let sonic army

684
00:27:04,340 --> 00:27:09,649
yes she's bite feedback cycle yeah media

685
00:27:06,889 --> 00:27:11,658
and hacking you know starting that far

686
00:27:09,649 --> 00:27:15,018
back yeah I mean it you you you see

687
00:27:11,659 --> 00:27:17,840
techniques that were sort of pioneered

688
00:27:15,019 --> 00:27:19,460
20 years ago now being used in basically

689
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:21,799
with several warfare today I mean you

690
00:27:19,460 --> 00:27:23,690
have people in governments doing this to

691
00:27:21,799 --> 00:27:26,029
each other in different ways I know I

692
00:27:23,690 --> 00:27:27,259
also think that CDC I mean correct me if

693
00:27:26,029 --> 00:27:29,570
you disagree but I think that we were

694
00:27:27,259 --> 00:27:31,399
the first hacking group to truly really

695
00:27:29,570 --> 00:27:33,710
try to leverage the media to get

696
00:27:31,399 --> 00:27:38,029
messages out there that sort of you know

697
00:27:33,710 --> 00:27:40,489
we had a you know a list of contacts of

698
00:27:38,029 --> 00:27:42,109
people that we can send out our global

699
00:27:40,489 --> 00:27:43,700
domination update to like let them know

700
00:27:42,109 --> 00:27:45,889
what was going on or you know both

701
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:46,940
within within what we were doing and

702
00:27:45,889 --> 00:27:48,979
also things that we thought were

703
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:51,109
important and so we would send this list

704
00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:52,489
out you know a couple hundred people a

705
00:27:51,109 --> 00:27:53,689
couple under names and then some of them

706
00:27:52,489 --> 00:27:55,730
would come back and hey tell me more

707
00:27:53,690 --> 00:27:59,809
that's definitely unique because if it

708
00:27:55,730 --> 00:28:01,489
was like you know other some others sure

709
00:27:59,809 --> 00:28:02,928
propaganda man I got to do my job yeah

710
00:28:01,489 --> 00:28:05,159
some other hackers you know we're like

711
00:28:02,929 --> 00:28:06,690
you know either worried about arrest or

712
00:28:05,159 --> 00:28:08,220
they were like soul hackers you know

713
00:28:06,690 --> 00:28:09,989
they were like you know like the Soul

714
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:11,820
Surfer going off by himself and their

715
00:28:09,989 --> 00:28:13,139
mind the crowds at my graduation you

716
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:15,450
guys are like oh there's a camera here

717
00:28:13,139 --> 00:28:17,129
we are yeah and it confused the heck out

718
00:28:15,450 --> 00:28:18,239
of folks because most of the time they

719
00:28:17,129 --> 00:28:19,529
were like no hackers don't want to be

720
00:28:18,239 --> 00:28:20,549
known and everything and then here are

721
00:28:19,529 --> 00:28:22,320
some ones just like that yeah here's a

722
00:28:20,549 --> 00:28:24,450
contact information you know you reach

723
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:25,979
out to us know people like what's going

724
00:28:24,450 --> 00:28:30,269
on here there's a little bit of value to

725
00:28:25,979 --> 00:28:34,529
that what you do to the media after yeah

726
00:28:30,269 --> 00:28:36,210
it's a Jim I mean he was never just

727
00:28:34,529 --> 00:28:38,759
technical it was always like this aspect

728
00:28:36,210 --> 00:28:40,529
ish I you know I would compare you know

729
00:28:38,759 --> 00:28:41,129
my vision of CDC is more like the

730
00:28:40,529 --> 00:28:42,929
yes-man

731
00:28:41,129 --> 00:28:44,699
no that's that's what I would I you know

732
00:28:42,929 --> 00:28:45,960
that was I mean the yes men didn't exist

733
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:48,269
yet when we're doing that but that like

734
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:49,889
it's the same it's a parallel so then I

735
00:28:48,269 --> 00:28:53,539
joined it because I was a fan of the ups

736
00:28:49,889 --> 00:28:53,539
and happy Hoffman and Jerry Rubin and

737
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:59,999
still do so one of the I think positive

738
00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:02,580
message to the CDC is that you can have

739
00:28:59,999 --> 00:29:04,710
like a really big impact in a small

740
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:07,678
group in a variety of settings within a

741
00:29:04,710 --> 00:29:09,119
big company in a small company any

742
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:10,559
company or in the government and and

743
00:29:09,119 --> 00:29:13,649
when I was interviewing you guys for the

744
00:29:10,559 --> 00:29:15,029
book I mean much had a great explanation

745
00:29:13,649 --> 00:29:17,488
for why he wanted to work for the

746
00:29:15,029 --> 00:29:19,200
government and Chris had a great

747
00:29:17,489 --> 00:29:21,029
explanation for why he thought he could

748
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:22,590
make the most impact outside of the

749
00:29:21,029 --> 00:29:24,149
government so could you briefly restate

750
00:29:22,590 --> 00:29:28,080
you know your reasoning much you want to

751
00:29:24,149 --> 00:29:29,609
go pretty sure I had reached out to try

752
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:31,408
and build sensitivities you know all

753
00:29:29,609 --> 00:29:35,449
throughout the lifetime I was training

754
00:29:31,409 --> 00:29:38,279
folks at NSA and I foresee for in XTA o

755
00:29:35,450 --> 00:29:41,190
etc I was reaching out to folks in the

756
00:29:38,279 --> 00:29:43,979
executive office of the branch and the

757
00:29:41,190 --> 00:29:45,359
goal was you know and I was actually

758
00:29:43,979 --> 00:29:46,710
even going out to West Point and

759
00:29:45,359 --> 00:29:48,689
teaching the cadets and stuff during

760
00:29:46,710 --> 00:29:50,669
this time period and it was I wanted to

761
00:29:48,690 --> 00:29:52,349
build sensitivities I wanted folk I

762
00:29:50,669 --> 00:29:54,359
wanted to influence the Future Leaders I

763
00:29:52,349 --> 00:29:56,340
wanted to have you know discussions I

764
00:29:54,359 --> 00:29:57,899
didn't want them to be afraid of some

765
00:29:56,340 --> 00:29:59,668
boogeyman and give the boogey man more

766
00:29:57,899 --> 00:30:02,309
power that they deserved and I kind of

767
00:29:59,669 --> 00:30:04,289
set them up to go after stuff you know

768
00:30:02,309 --> 00:30:06,359
kind of like you know look choose us as

769
00:30:04,289 --> 00:30:07,919
the you know the opportunistic bad guy

770
00:30:06,359 --> 00:30:10,408
to take down and look that's not how it

771
00:30:07,919 --> 00:30:11,940
works so after you know we had done that

772
00:30:10,409 --> 00:30:13,830
throughout that entire time and when

773
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:14,850
DARPA reached out to me and I had

774
00:30:13,830 --> 00:30:16,500
already know

775
00:30:14,850 --> 00:30:18,330
new folks inside they knew me there

776
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:20,340
weren't these sort of scared aspects I

777
00:30:18,330 --> 00:30:22,379
saw that the government was making what

778
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:24,300
I thought were a lot of missteps and a

779
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:25,980
lot of mistakes and in particular in

780
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:28,050
research I was like this isn't really

781
00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:30,720
novel anymore there was a lot of what I

782
00:30:28,050 --> 00:30:32,730
considered wasteful spending

783
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:34,020
you know duplicative stuff of things

784
00:30:32,730 --> 00:30:35,700
that you know we were looking at at the

785
00:30:34,020 --> 00:30:37,320
conferences you know that our colleagues

786
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:39,000
we're doing but yet these were big

787
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:40,530
contractors getting hundreds of millions

788
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:43,730
of dollars and not being able to pull

789
00:30:40,530 --> 00:30:45,870
them off and I was like I'm drawn to

790
00:30:43,730 --> 00:30:47,760
environments that are complex and that I

791
00:30:45,870 --> 00:30:49,919
don't understand and I have to go inside

792
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:52,050
and I have to figure them out from as

793
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:54,510
many angles and I've got to try and fix

794
00:30:52,050 --> 00:30:57,210
them if that is my OCD and my wife is

795
00:30:54,510 --> 00:30:58,770
like yes that is your OCD so whether it

796
00:30:57,210 --> 00:31:00,240
was like you know being bit by the VCS

797
00:30:58,770 --> 00:31:02,040
and later you know I start to like you

798
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:03,420
know involve with private equity and

799
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:05,100
everything goes and now I've got this

800
00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:07,050
deck to try and like help everybody else

801
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:08,580
do not make the mistakes you know that I

802
00:31:07,050 --> 00:31:10,649
do whether it's the government or I'm

803
00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:12,419
like you're making poor uninformed

804
00:31:10,650 --> 00:31:14,400
choices I see it from the government

805
00:31:12,420 --> 00:31:16,800
contract or I saw some a loss I saw it

806
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:19,200
from you know an advisor I'm gonna go in

807
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:20,639
as a general essentially you know they

808
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:23,130
give me the opportunity I've got to do

809
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:25,440
it and hopefully you know that opens

810
00:31:23,130 --> 00:31:27,330
doors like one of the things that Joseph

811
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:29,550
said in the questions was like you know

812
00:31:27,330 --> 00:31:31,439
with Congress and everything how you did

813
00:31:29,550 --> 00:31:33,270
that and how that wasn't enough and I

814
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:35,220
was like well actually it was never

815
00:31:33,270 --> 00:31:37,410
about being enough it was about opening

816
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:39,330
doors to everybody else could do it and

817
00:31:37,410 --> 00:31:41,400
until you build those relationships you

818
00:31:39,330 --> 00:31:42,060
can't let somebody else go through and

819
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:44,970
take it further

820
00:31:42,060 --> 00:31:47,790
so yeah the you know the Congress stuff

821
00:31:44,970 --> 00:31:49,920
DARPA CFT was all about like opening the

822
00:31:47,790 --> 00:31:52,440
floodgates letting the diversity come in

823
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:55,110
and expanding you know the the influence

824
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:56,850
and the sensitivities between two groups

825
00:31:55,110 --> 00:32:00,600
that I don't think should ever see eye

826
00:31:56,850 --> 00:32:01,860
to eye so see if T is so cool that you

827
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:03,929
know particular for this audience that I

828
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:06,270
think so I don't you want to talk a

829
00:32:03,930 --> 00:32:08,850
little bit more about it I was is I

830
00:32:06,270 --> 00:32:11,850
didn't know of any prior way for you

831
00:32:08,850 --> 00:32:14,399
know a hacker loan hacker small group of

832
00:32:11,850 --> 00:32:15,929
hackers say they're not Beltway bandits

833
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:17,250
it's a it's the polar opposite how the

834
00:32:15,930 --> 00:32:18,420
hell do you deal with the Pentagon how

835
00:32:17,250 --> 00:32:20,760
do you have you do that stuff

836
00:32:18,420 --> 00:32:23,700
tell me a little bit about so CFT was a

837
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:24,720
thing called cyber fast track and when I

838
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:27,450
went into DARPA

839
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:29,309
I realized that we in this community for

840
00:32:27,450 --> 00:32:32,370
the past twenty thirty years you know at

841
00:32:29,309 --> 00:32:33,780
the hacker conferences def cons ho ho

842
00:32:32,370 --> 00:32:35,939
cons and stuff finally had a seat at the

843
00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:38,190
table and one of the things that I saw

844
00:32:35,940 --> 00:32:39,510
was you had to be this huge company we

845
00:32:38,190 --> 00:32:40,740
talked about this the law if it wouldn't

846
00:32:39,510 --> 00:32:42,419
it be great if we could get some sort of

847
00:32:40,740 --> 00:32:46,200
government grant to do the work that

848
00:32:42,419 --> 00:32:49,289
dill wanted to do you know I think you

849
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:53,220
yes the undeveloped estudio which is

850
00:32:49,289 --> 00:32:56,309
what turn into varicose lint but what I

851
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:58,020
was doing and it wasn't the barrier to

852
00:32:56,309 --> 00:33:00,000
entry was huge you had to have war

853
00:32:58,020 --> 00:33:01,139
chests of money he had to do proposals

854
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,150
that took months and months and months

855
00:33:01,140 --> 00:33:04,559
on end you know it's like it was a

856
00:33:03,150 --> 00:33:06,240
little boys Network

857
00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:08,070
and when I went in there I brought in a

858
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:10,200
bunch of folks and I said you know how

859
00:33:08,070 --> 00:33:11,970
do how do we change this and by the way

860
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:13,020
I didn't think that the government

861
00:33:11,970 --> 00:33:14,640
contract at the time we're doing

862
00:33:13,020 --> 00:33:16,500
innovative research and you know what

863
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:18,179
makes people do innovative research the

864
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:20,880
fear of your lunch PE and bring in

865
00:33:18,179 --> 00:33:24,840
competition so essentially what it did

866
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:27,780
was I got I got taxpayer money allocated

867
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:29,250
that you could do a proposal if you

868
00:33:27,780 --> 00:33:31,049
tried to solve the government problem

869
00:33:29,250 --> 00:33:32,760
you're immediately rejected this was

870
00:33:31,049 --> 00:33:34,289
again sort of like understanding the I

871
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:36,570
want you to solve a problem and your

872
00:33:34,289 --> 00:33:37,830
community that matters to you my job is

873
00:33:36,570 --> 00:33:39,600
to look at it from the government side

874
00:33:37,830 --> 00:33:41,100
and see if there's overlap and see if

875
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:42,870
you know both communities are get a

876
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:44,100
benefit from it you try and solve

877
00:33:42,870 --> 00:33:45,600
somebody else's problems that you don't

878
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:47,428
know you're not gonna do a great job and

879
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:48,809
you're just doing it for the money you

880
00:33:47,429 --> 00:33:50,940
try and solve a problem that you're

881
00:33:48,809 --> 00:33:53,370
passionate about and that bothers you

882
00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:55,409
and that you really have lived you're

883
00:33:53,370 --> 00:33:57,629
gonna solve that fuckin problem

884
00:33:55,409 --> 00:33:58,590
and what I did was it was a it was a

885
00:33:57,630 --> 00:34:00,659
hack that didn't really involve

886
00:33:58,590 --> 00:34:02,908
computers so government processes

887
00:34:00,659 --> 00:34:04,950
normally were like six months to eight

888
00:34:02,909 --> 00:34:06,419
months to like get an award and get a

889
00:34:04,950 --> 00:34:07,799
contract and I said I'm gonna hack the

890
00:34:06,419 --> 00:34:09,659
government process government

891
00:34:07,799 --> 00:34:12,239
contracting the federal acquisitions

892
00:34:09,659 --> 00:34:13,980
regulations so the average time you

893
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:15,629
could submit a proposal the proposal was

894
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:18,780
all of like six seven pages there was a

895
00:34:15,629 --> 00:34:21,210
template I get it I'd read it you are on

896
00:34:18,780 --> 00:34:23,220
contract and funded and working and you

897
00:34:21,210 --> 00:34:25,649
could be an individual or a small duo

898
00:34:23,219 --> 00:34:28,109
came out of it a trail of bits came out

899
00:34:25,649 --> 00:34:29,699
of it hack RF the G packs were of that

900
00:34:28,109 --> 00:34:31,168
Charlie Miller did which kind of open

901
00:34:29,699 --> 00:34:32,230
that up we're all out of cyber fast

902
00:34:31,168 --> 00:34:34,060
track

903
00:34:32,230 --> 00:34:36,129
three days turnaround time that was the

904
00:34:34,060 --> 00:34:37,540
entire government contract one-page

905
00:34:36,129 --> 00:34:40,359
commercial would you own all the rights

906
00:34:37,540 --> 00:34:42,159
to it go leverage that against the VCS

907
00:34:40,359 --> 00:34:43,418
because now you've turned it into an

908
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:45,550
engineering problem at a research

909
00:34:43,418 --> 00:34:46,690
problem sort of setup and yeah that was

910
00:34:45,550 --> 00:34:48,310
my hack inside the government that was

911
00:34:46,690 --> 00:34:49,990
like I think I figured out this complex

912
00:34:48,310 --> 00:34:54,159
system and I want to shake it up a bit

913
00:34:49,989 --> 00:34:55,509
it's awesome really amazing all right

914
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:56,859
why did you know you know the

915
00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:58,390
government's got all the brains got all

916
00:34:56,859 --> 00:35:01,390
the money why not go work for the

917
00:34:58,390 --> 00:35:03,490
government to do your cool stuff my

918
00:35:01,390 --> 00:35:04,960
goals were different you know

919
00:35:03,490 --> 00:35:07,419
specifically it was less about opening

920
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:09,579
doors I had algorithms that I wanted to

921
00:35:07,420 --> 00:35:12,339
have applied to basically as many

922
00:35:09,579 --> 00:35:14,560
programs as I could I had developed a

923
00:35:12,339 --> 00:35:16,660
system for automating the analysis of

924
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:22,150
binaries finding vulnerabilities and

925
00:35:16,660 --> 00:35:23,980
helping them get fixed initially I had

926
00:35:22,150 --> 00:35:26,170
build this as an automated D compilation

927
00:35:23,980 --> 00:35:28,180
system however so the government

928
00:35:26,170 --> 00:35:30,520
interests that came to me was not about

929
00:35:28,180 --> 00:35:33,279
fixing the world's problems in security

930
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:34,599
it was about reverse engineering code

931
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:37,630
from wherever it happened to have showed

932
00:35:34,599 --> 00:35:41,650
up from so you know when I got invited

933
00:35:37,630 --> 00:35:44,980
to present my work at the NSA and CIA in

934
00:35:41,650 --> 00:35:50,560
other places it invariably turned into

935
00:35:44,980 --> 00:35:53,200
so you know can this D compile this

936
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:55,210
thing or can this decompile you know

937
00:35:53,200 --> 00:36:00,250
centrifuge firmware or whatever it was

938
00:35:55,210 --> 00:36:03,940
you know I I didn't want to see

939
00:36:00,250 --> 00:36:05,920
something that I had spent eight eight

940
00:36:03,940 --> 00:36:07,420
years yeah my baby basically disappear

941
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:10,630
into the bowels of a classified

942
00:36:07,420 --> 00:36:11,680
institution and not being applied to

943
00:36:10,630 --> 00:36:12,790
where I felt the problems were the

944
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:14,440
government systems

945
00:36:12,790 --> 00:36:16,359
despite being classified we're still

946
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:18,010
dependent on the public sector they were

947
00:36:16,359 --> 00:36:19,720
still dependent on Microsoft operating

948
00:36:18,010 --> 00:36:22,150
systems and Oracle databases and

949
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:24,069
everything else that needed a good you

950
00:36:22,150 --> 00:36:26,200
know dose of automation to find the

951
00:36:24,069 --> 00:36:28,480
flaws no I mean the one thing that at

952
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:30,339
stake proof to me was that you can put

953
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:32,170
all the smartest people you know in one

954
00:36:30,339 --> 00:36:33,578
place and there won't be enough of them

955
00:36:32,170 --> 00:36:36,250
to fix the security problems out there

956
00:36:33,579 --> 00:36:38,260
it was not a person problem it was a

957
00:36:36,250 --> 00:36:40,089
problem to scale so I want to have

958
00:36:38,260 --> 00:36:44,230
addressed that with as much automation

959
00:36:40,089 --> 00:36:45,880
as I could and it was either you know it

960
00:36:44,230 --> 00:36:47,020
get buried in

961
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:49,030
you know is some kind of government

962
00:36:47,020 --> 00:36:52,540
classified thing scanning you know

963
00:36:49,030 --> 00:36:54,640
missile code or something or we aim it

964
00:36:52,540 --> 00:36:57,160
at every single binary in the public

965
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:59,830
sector period and I think you know the

966
00:36:57,160 --> 00:37:01,750
impact of that and spawning any level of

967
00:36:59,830 --> 00:37:03,220
competition in the in the space of

968
00:37:01,750 --> 00:37:05,770
automating security vulnerability

969
00:37:03,220 --> 00:37:08,859
analysis you know I'm proud to have had

970
00:37:05,770 --> 00:37:10,360
to any anything to do with that you know

971
00:37:08,860 --> 00:37:13,150
I felt it was the right move at the time

972
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:16,870
despite the fact that you know the the

973
00:37:13,150 --> 00:37:19,030
CEO of at stake turned out to eventually

974
00:37:16,870 --> 00:37:21,880
be the CEO of Inc you tell which is you

975
00:37:19,030 --> 00:37:25,240
know Chris Darby I really there was a

976
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:26,410
lot of gravity to have what I was doing

977
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:30,100
kind of eventually go down the

978
00:37:26,410 --> 00:37:31,450
government rabbit hole but I had we had

979
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:33,370
to pretty much consciously pull that

980
00:37:31,450 --> 00:37:34,899
back and be like no this is this is

981
00:37:33,370 --> 00:37:37,960
meant for the world to see not just for

982
00:37:34,900 --> 00:37:40,810
you know a privileged view I want to I

983
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:42,190
want to sort of touch one another so one

984
00:37:40,810 --> 00:37:43,930
of the things that was interesting to me

985
00:37:42,190 --> 00:37:45,520
in the research was the internal debates

986
00:37:43,930 --> 00:37:48,069
that there was like good-faith

987
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:50,170
discussions within CDC on some really

988
00:37:48,070 --> 00:37:52,330
tricky stuff and you know some of the

989
00:37:50,170 --> 00:37:54,580
calls are not obviously I mean that it's

990
00:37:52,330 --> 00:37:56,560
the debate you know might wind up 6040

991
00:37:54,580 --> 00:37:59,440
want something another but I think one

992
00:37:56,560 --> 00:38:00,940
of the more ones the resonates one of

993
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:03,460
the things that resonates the debate

994
00:38:00,940 --> 00:38:07,060
over over WikiLeaks which changed as

995
00:38:03,460 --> 00:38:10,140
WikiLeaks changed yeah but also had one

996
00:38:07,060 --> 00:38:15,250
of your one of your members involved

997
00:38:10,140 --> 00:38:18,520
who's Jacob Obama tie what do you think

998
00:38:15,250 --> 00:38:22,360
of WikiLeaks now I thought the original

999
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:28,240
stated goal of WikiLeaks was a laudable

1000
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:32,890
one I think it quickly became a personal

1001
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:35,049
sort of ego trip of prof. Julian Assange

1002
00:38:32,890 --> 00:38:36,370
who you know we had all known from back

1003
00:38:35,050 --> 00:38:40,150
in the day he used to hang out on pound

1004
00:38:36,370 --> 00:38:42,460
to hack on IRC begging tricks boys and

1005
00:38:40,150 --> 00:38:45,340
you know I even when I thought the the

1006
00:38:42,460 --> 00:38:46,240
goal of WikiLeaks was laudable Julian

1007
00:38:45,340 --> 00:38:48,550
was always an asshole

1008
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:50,859
I mean any he just he was always an

1009
00:38:48,550 --> 00:38:51,490
asshole but like it was just like oh

1010
00:38:50,860 --> 00:38:53,170
he's an ass

1011
00:38:51,490 --> 00:38:57,700
that's good but there was a go wait no

1012
00:38:53,170 --> 00:39:00,280
now you know maybe maybe not so you know

1013
00:38:57,700 --> 00:39:02,080
the the stuff with Jake is again he was

1014
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:04,840
somebody who on paper seemed like he was

1015
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:06,730
you know working on good projects he was

1016
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:09,250
involved in all these other sort of

1017
00:39:06,730 --> 00:39:11,170
areas and it was only sort of you know

1018
00:39:09,250 --> 00:39:12,730
as time went by we're like oh you're not

1019
00:39:11,170 --> 00:39:15,000
really doing this stuff re you're just

1020
00:39:12,730 --> 00:39:18,430
getting your name attached to things and

1021
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:21,040
you know then when the revelations about

1022
00:39:18,430 --> 00:39:22,899
his you know is his actions sorts women

1023
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:24,430
in tort and also harassed men etc like

1024
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:26,290
came out it was like no this is not

1025
00:39:24,430 --> 00:39:28,149
somebody that that we at all want to

1026
00:39:26,290 --> 00:39:30,279
have associated with CDC it didn't share

1027
00:39:28,150 --> 00:39:33,880
our values yeah no exactly did not share

1028
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:36,220
a guy you know only person you know

1029
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:38,830
jettison only person CDC has ever kicked

1030
00:39:36,220 --> 00:39:40,868
out all right I want to talk a little

1031
00:39:38,830 --> 00:39:42,610
bit more about the present-day before we

1032
00:39:40,869 --> 00:39:45,340
turn to two questions in a few minutes

1033
00:39:42,610 --> 00:39:47,740
so I know you guys get asked us a lot

1034
00:39:45,340 --> 00:39:50,530
but you know if if you were doing this

1035
00:39:47,740 --> 00:39:53,080
if C's could a CDC come together now for

1036
00:39:50,530 --> 00:39:55,720
the first time it what the heck form

1037
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:57,549
would it take and what sorts of problems

1038
00:39:55,720 --> 00:40:00,160
would it be taking on oh I'd really hope

1039
00:39:57,550 --> 00:40:02,080
that we'd all look and say that there is

1040
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:04,540
one it's actually even larger and it's

1041
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:07,480
what the CCC has continued to become and

1042
00:40:04,540 --> 00:40:09,520
grow into the Chaos Computer Club over

1043
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:11,830
in Germany which is a worldwide sort of

1044
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:13,210
reach and has a very interesting and you

1045
00:40:11,830 --> 00:40:14,830
know it's still like relatively

1046
00:40:13,210 --> 00:40:17,080
autonomous sort of way but you know

1047
00:40:14,830 --> 00:40:19,420
there's people that help provide it yeah

1048
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:21,220
IRA party another fire party zero there

1049
00:40:19,420 --> 00:40:22,420
writing guidance pieces for Parliament

1050
00:40:21,220 --> 00:40:24,430
they're helping to like you know pull

1051
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:26,560
back you know you know bad missteps from

1052
00:40:24,430 --> 00:40:27,549
governments and other areas and educate

1053
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:29,230
them so they can make more informed

1054
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:30,820
decisions they you know they run some

1055
00:40:29,230 --> 00:40:32,350
really good Congress is I mean that's

1056
00:40:30,820 --> 00:40:34,320
what I had always wanted to model the

1057
00:40:32,350 --> 00:40:36,190
loft off I just didn't understand that

1058
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:37,570
essentially whoppin folks you know

1059
00:40:36,190 --> 00:40:38,680
having a baby millions of bucks and

1060
00:40:37,570 --> 00:40:40,210
we're willing to spend it all on an

1061
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:43,180
altruistic digging yeah we didn't have

1062
00:40:40,210 --> 00:40:45,250
that you know but CCC and CN and CDC

1063
00:40:43,180 --> 00:40:47,529
we're you know to me like the least to

1064
00:40:45,250 --> 00:40:50,500
really you know beautiful you know kind

1065
00:40:47,530 --> 00:40:52,330
of like altruistic organizations so I

1066
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:53,590
think there's one else energy yeah

1067
00:40:52,330 --> 00:40:55,299
there's a lot of synergy there I mean

1068
00:40:53,590 --> 00:40:58,630
there's there's there's you know people

1069
00:40:55,300 --> 00:41:02,590
that have the same sort of ethos and

1070
00:40:58,630 --> 00:41:04,380
attitudes as a lot of CDC I mean you

1071
00:41:02,590 --> 00:41:06,599
look at you know from in

1072
00:41:04,380 --> 00:41:08,519
in politics even our like within

1073
00:41:06,599 --> 00:41:09,539
politics within all kinds of like you

1074
00:41:08,519 --> 00:41:11,758
know the one that comes to mind for me

1075
00:41:09,539 --> 00:41:13,920
is the xpm of Iceland Brigadier Johnson

1076
00:41:11,759 --> 00:41:17,069
you know there are people that have

1077
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:18,210
those those ideas and are willing to put

1078
00:41:17,069 --> 00:41:20,009
them up on the world stage you know

1079
00:41:18,210 --> 00:41:21,960
there's the extinction rebellion people

1080
00:41:20,009 --> 00:41:24,900
movement in the UK that's dealing with

1081
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:30,900
climate change there's people who are

1082
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:32,339
looking into election security I mean

1083
00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:34,109
all kinds of I mean these people are out

1084
00:41:32,339 --> 00:41:35,940
there yeah you'll have to be you don't

1085
00:41:34,109 --> 00:41:37,799
to be a group I mean okay is look at any

1086
00:41:35,940 --> 00:41:38,970
of these other presently you involve in

1087
00:41:37,799 --> 00:41:41,609
the communities that are like you know

1088
00:41:38,970 --> 00:41:43,500
helping set up stuff at hope at you know

1089
00:41:41,609 --> 00:41:44,970
at DEFCON for the hacking village you

1090
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:46,589
know you'll find a few folks that have

1091
00:41:44,970 --> 00:41:48,209
gone into DARPA because they saw that I

1092
00:41:46,589 --> 00:41:49,589
was able to do it and you know they're

1093
00:41:48,210 --> 00:41:51,779
trying to like do the same thing because

1094
00:41:49,589 --> 00:41:53,670
the doors are open I mean that's kind of

1095
00:41:51,779 --> 00:41:55,799
what CDC was doing CDC open the door for

1096
00:41:53,670 --> 00:41:57,450
me and you know hopefully we've opened

1097
00:41:55,799 --> 00:42:00,769
up doors for other people oh maybe one

1098
00:41:57,450 --> 00:42:00,769
day somebody will run for president

1099
00:42:01,519 --> 00:42:05,819
psychedelic forward 2020 make American

1100
00:42:04,289 --> 00:42:07,549
chaotic you should explain to folks who

1101
00:42:05,819 --> 00:42:10,230
haven't read the book or seen the

1102
00:42:07,549 --> 00:42:10,710
alright if you don't know this beta

1103
00:42:10,230 --> 00:42:12,599
Roark

1104
00:42:10,710 --> 00:42:15,029
was running for president of the United

1105
00:42:12,599 --> 00:42:17,579
States of America was a hacker and he

1106
00:42:15,029 --> 00:42:19,440
was in CDC in its formative early years

1107
00:42:17,579 --> 00:42:21,869
he wrote a number of text files which

1108
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:24,259
are still online because he sees files

1109
00:42:21,869 --> 00:42:28,259
live on forever much to his chagrin the

1110
00:42:24,259 --> 00:42:29,849
end of everything and he left before CDC

1111
00:42:28,259 --> 00:42:32,460
got really big but he was an important

1112
00:42:29,849 --> 00:42:34,380
early player in it and I think is you

1113
00:42:32,460 --> 00:42:35,819
know some of this textiles are silly no

1114
00:42:34,380 --> 00:42:39,029
it's a preface and they're written when

1115
00:42:35,819 --> 00:42:40,890
he's 14 yes he was 14 15 years old and I

1116
00:42:39,029 --> 00:42:42,390
think one of them actually resonates

1117
00:42:40,890 --> 00:42:45,269
pretty well which is he and a friend

1118
00:42:42,390 --> 00:42:46,710
interviewed at neo-nazi in Texas and let

1119
00:42:45,269 --> 00:42:50,129
the guy hang himself with his own words

1120
00:42:46,710 --> 00:42:52,680
and posted for all to see and I don't

1121
00:42:50,130 --> 00:42:56,220
think neo-nazis were a huge issue in the

1122
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:58,649
late 80s in Texas but they are now so

1123
00:42:56,220 --> 00:43:00,450
good to have seen that and also to his

1124
00:42:58,650 --> 00:43:03,089
credit he gener indicate gender

1125
00:43:00,450 --> 00:43:05,609
integrated CDC yeah history he was all

1126
00:43:03,089 --> 00:43:08,190
about diversity even at 415 and he was

1127
00:43:05,609 --> 00:43:10,319
all about engaging folks with disparate

1128
00:43:08,190 --> 00:43:12,660
beliefs and that was very much the ethos

1129
00:43:10,319 --> 00:43:13,920
and pathos of CDC he was one of you know

1130
00:43:12,660 --> 00:43:15,538
there were these people that were the

1131
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:17,390
sort of the previous generation of CDC

1132
00:43:15,539 --> 00:43:19,670
before I joined so I joined him like 19

1133
00:43:17,390 --> 00:43:21,230
and before that so these are the people

1134
00:43:19,670 --> 00:43:23,660
that were in the first years and who

1135
00:43:21,230 --> 00:43:25,130
were influential upon me and influential

1136
00:43:23,660 --> 00:43:26,690
the people who then joined the sort of

1137
00:43:25,130 --> 00:43:28,130
the second generation and you know I

1138
00:43:26,690 --> 00:43:29,270
would see you know the stuff he was

1139
00:43:28,130 --> 00:43:30,650
writing about the stuff he was talking

1140
00:43:29,270 --> 00:43:32,360
about all this on the boards and you

1141
00:43:30,650 --> 00:43:35,150
know this is you know that was the

1142
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:37,070
influent that that helped influence you

1143
00:43:35,150 --> 00:43:38,360
know my own views you know because as I

1144
00:43:37,070 --> 00:43:39,800
say I grew up in the middle of nowhere

1145
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:42,230
and you know I don't necessarily have

1146
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:45,290
that didn't have the widest world view

1147
00:43:42,230 --> 00:43:47,150
so to get these sort of enough other you

1148
00:43:45,290 --> 00:43:49,640
know viewpoints was very valuable and in

1149
00:43:47,150 --> 00:43:51,650
my own development I think one of the

1150
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:54,200
things that stood out about a bait

1151
00:43:51,650 --> 00:43:55,760
o'rourke and you know back in that time

1152
00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:57,500
when I met him and this was an important

1153
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:59,690
aspect of you know how would you create

1154
00:43:57,500 --> 00:44:02,090
another cult of the dead cow right now

1155
00:43:59,690 --> 00:44:03,590
is you can do it online but there's

1156
00:44:02,090 --> 00:44:04,880
something about when you all actually

1157
00:44:03,590 --> 00:44:07,220
get together and you actually believe

1158
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:09,170
the person and you figure out are they

1159
00:44:07,220 --> 00:44:10,819
really what I thought they were and when

1160
00:44:09,170 --> 00:44:13,040
you met baitul it's just like oh my gosh

1161
00:44:10,820 --> 00:44:16,550
this guy you know this this is what we

1162
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:18,140
we are it was very you know accepting he

1163
00:44:16,550 --> 00:44:19,100
was very welcoming he was very open he

1164
00:44:18,140 --> 00:44:20,660
was like you know him create just a

1165
00:44:19,100 --> 00:44:22,910
friendly guy in sync same thing with

1166
00:44:20,660 --> 00:44:24,049
Luke and you know Dylan I you know yeah

1167
00:44:22,910 --> 00:44:24,259
I only talk shit about you behind your

1168
00:44:24,050 --> 00:44:26,570
back

1169
00:44:24,260 --> 00:44:30,560
yeah no I appreciate that that's really

1170
00:44:26,570 --> 00:44:32,090
cool I should say that I really

1171
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:34,940
appreciate it that oh being open about

1172
00:44:32,090 --> 00:44:37,160
why she joined what he got out of CDC

1173
00:44:34,940 --> 00:44:39,080
answer the value variable rules can be

1174
00:44:37,160 --> 00:44:40,940
played by people you know coming from an

1175
00:44:39,080 --> 00:44:42,890
outsider perspective these are critical

1176
00:44:40,940 --> 00:44:44,890
thinking hackers or people who don't fit

1177
00:44:42,890 --> 00:44:47,299
in with you know any other sort of mass

1178
00:44:44,890 --> 00:44:54,500
mass I'm in prize so many people were

1179
00:44:47,300 --> 00:44:57,020
able to keep a secret for so long last

1180
00:44:54,500 --> 00:44:58,340
thing I want to ask you guys there in

1181
00:44:57,020 --> 00:45:00,470
self and now right now there are these

1182
00:44:58,340 --> 00:45:02,360
this rank and file movements or on a

1183
00:45:00,470 --> 00:45:04,549
number of issues from treatment of

1184
00:45:02,360 --> 00:45:06,860
contractors instead of different from

1185
00:45:04,550 --> 00:45:09,980
full-time employees to artificial

1186
00:45:06,860 --> 00:45:11,810
intelligence to contracts with various

1187
00:45:09,980 --> 00:45:13,520
government entities including ice to

1188
00:45:11,810 --> 00:45:16,670
weather we're not certain that we should

1189
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:18,230
go back to simple remedies science is

1190
00:45:16,670 --> 00:45:20,060
really big stuff which I have never not

1191
00:45:18,230 --> 00:45:25,310
seen in 20 years of covering Silicon

1192
00:45:20,060 --> 00:45:27,020
Valley before you see parallels in what

1193
00:45:25,310 --> 00:45:29,570
they're doing to what you guys were

1194
00:45:27,020 --> 00:45:33,110
doing back in the day

1195
00:45:29,570 --> 00:45:36,050
yes I I mean I think to some degree or

1196
00:45:33,110 --> 00:45:38,120
at least at least spiritual parallels

1197
00:45:36,050 --> 00:45:40,280
you know philosophical parallels and I

1198
00:45:38,120 --> 00:45:43,250
you know I love it I mean I you know I

1199
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:46,400
would like to think that I would have

1200
00:45:43,250 --> 00:45:48,860
the you know the you know the the

1201
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:50,240
personal integrity to stand up if I saw

1202
00:45:48,860 --> 00:45:52,580
that my the company that I was working

1203
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:54,529
for was treating people in a way that I

1204
00:45:52,580 --> 00:45:56,600
thought was unjust or were you know

1205
00:45:54,530 --> 00:45:59,110
doing something that I thought was

1206
00:45:56,600 --> 00:46:02,240
unethical I'd like to think that I would

1207
00:45:59,110 --> 00:46:03,830
you know you have the integrity to stand

1208
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:06,529
up against that I mean I think that I'm

1209
00:46:03,830 --> 00:46:07,790
I feel glad that I've never had to do

1210
00:46:06,530 --> 00:46:09,380
had to do that that I've never worked

1211
00:46:07,790 --> 00:46:12,140
for a company that I felt like oh my god

1212
00:46:09,380 --> 00:46:14,300
they're doing evil things but I'd like

1213
00:46:12,140 --> 00:46:15,950
to think that I would and I have

1214
00:46:14,300 --> 00:46:18,410
tremendous amount of respect for people

1215
00:46:15,950 --> 00:46:20,120
who do yeah the thing that I see

1216
00:46:18,410 --> 00:46:22,940
recently happening it doesn't get a

1217
00:46:20,120 --> 00:46:24,799
whole lot of press in this industry is I

1218
00:46:22,940 --> 00:46:27,440
mean well the whole hacking and CDC

1219
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:28,760
theme the whole media saturation bit to

1220
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:31,010
some extent is about inspiring

1221
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:33,200
collective action you know you have a

1222
00:46:31,010 --> 00:46:34,700
few famous people doing something that

1223
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:35,839
then inspires a whole lot of other

1224
00:46:34,700 --> 00:46:39,319
people to do those things to take a

1225
00:46:35,840 --> 00:46:40,670
photo yeah and you know I'm seeing a lot

1226
00:46:39,320 --> 00:46:43,430
more workers standing up for themselves

1227
00:46:40,670 --> 00:46:46,370
and tech jobs that would otherwise be

1228
00:46:43,430 --> 00:46:47,839
completely marginalized you know the one

1229
00:46:46,370 --> 00:46:50,240
that comes to mind is the video game

1230
00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:53,300
industry I fully support the

1231
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:54,859
unionization of video game developers I

1232
00:46:53,300 --> 00:46:57,140
wanted to write video games when I was a

1233
00:46:54,860 --> 00:46:58,700
kid that's why I got into like kernel

1234
00:46:57,140 --> 00:47:01,400
and assembly and all this low-level

1235
00:46:58,700 --> 00:47:02,750
stuff then I got to MIT and I was about

1236
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:03,770
to get out and I was like I want to go

1237
00:47:02,750 --> 00:47:05,000
write video games for a living then I

1238
00:47:03,770 --> 00:47:07,370
talked to people who really did that

1239
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:09,550
work and they were like this it's a

1240
00:47:07,370 --> 00:47:12,500
whole you know it's a sweatshop record I

1241
00:47:09,550 --> 00:47:13,880
you know finally 20 years later these

1242
00:47:12,500 --> 00:47:17,300
people are getting around to demanding

1243
00:47:13,880 --> 00:47:19,550
you know you know just trust treatment

1244
00:47:17,300 --> 00:47:22,820
and and you know our hours that make

1245
00:47:19,550 --> 00:47:25,310
sense and you know you know fairness so

1246
00:47:22,820 --> 00:47:26,630
you know I think you know that kind of

1247
00:47:25,310 --> 00:47:27,549
collective action that we're gonna see

1248
00:47:26,630 --> 00:47:30,620
more and more of that

1249
00:47:27,550 --> 00:47:32,600
Aztec figures out really what what it

1250
00:47:30,620 --> 00:47:34,190
wants to be so some of these tech

1251
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:36,740
companies you know kind of became the

1252
00:47:34,190 --> 00:47:39,230
establishment they were the upstarts and

1253
00:47:36,740 --> 00:47:40,700
that makes me think of like CDC and some

1254
00:47:39,230 --> 00:47:42,860
of the things that we did because at

1255
00:47:40,700 --> 00:47:44,359
some point the people you know if

1256
00:47:42,860 --> 00:47:46,340
especially if you're radical and you're

1257
00:47:44,360 --> 00:47:48,590
somewhat successful in your revolution

1258
00:47:46,340 --> 00:47:51,260
you become the establishment and the

1259
00:47:48,590 --> 00:47:52,850
choice as the establishment is what sort

1260
00:47:51,260 --> 00:47:54,290
of establishment are you going to become

1261
00:47:52,850 --> 00:47:56,600
and that's what we're seeing happen out

1262
00:47:54,290 --> 00:47:59,210
there you can be one that says we're

1263
00:47:56,600 --> 00:48:01,040
just gonna ossify and you know if we're

1264
00:47:59,210 --> 00:48:02,990
gonna rule czar gonna be you know we

1265
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:04,970
just do it because that's the way or you

1266
00:48:02,990 --> 00:48:07,310
can be an establishment that says no

1267
00:48:04,970 --> 00:48:09,560
diversity and we want to welcome like

1268
00:48:07,310 --> 00:48:11,360
the new changes the same way that you

1269
00:48:09,560 --> 00:48:12,770
know we cause change going in there and

1270
00:48:11,360 --> 00:48:14,210
I think some of these big tech companies

1271
00:48:12,770 --> 00:48:15,680
are really struggling with that right

1272
00:48:14,210 --> 00:48:17,750
now and I think some of these people

1273
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:19,879
standing up are kind of saying hey no

1274
00:48:17,750 --> 00:48:21,860
we're gonna force you I hope to be the

1275
00:48:19,880 --> 00:48:24,020
you know the establishment that you know

1276
00:48:21,860 --> 00:48:25,970
embraces more diversity and allows the

1277
00:48:24,020 --> 00:48:27,890
change and if you don't let us do it

1278
00:48:25,970 --> 00:48:29,779
we're gonna make you do it you use the

1279
00:48:27,890 --> 00:48:31,279
media you use the megaphone that you

1280
00:48:29,780 --> 00:48:33,050
build yourself to shift the balance of

1281
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:34,550
power and I think I can say that yes I

1282
00:48:33,050 --> 00:48:36,530
could say that coming from I was a

1283
00:48:34,550 --> 00:48:38,480
director in Google i/o as corporate vice

1284
00:48:36,530 --> 00:48:40,370
president and Motorola saw this inside

1285
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:41,360
and it's it's a real thing that they're

1286
00:48:40,370 --> 00:48:42,740
dealing with and it would be really

1287
00:48:41,360 --> 00:48:44,270
interesting and I have tremendous

1288
00:48:42,740 --> 00:48:45,859
respect for the folks who are willing to

1289
00:48:44,270 --> 00:48:48,590
fight for what they believe it okay

1290
00:48:45,860 --> 00:48:50,570
awesome all right we have about two

1291
00:48:48,590 --> 00:48:55,880
minutes for questions we have a couple

1292
00:48:50,570 --> 00:48:58,010
mics back there so stand up and get up

1293
00:48:55,880 --> 00:49:01,580
there and fire away I can't see anything

1294
00:48:58,010 --> 00:49:04,430
if you was under no obligation no you're

1295
00:49:01,580 --> 00:49:06,279
definitely under an obligation lock the

1296
00:49:04,430 --> 00:49:09,529
doors

1297
00:49:06,280 --> 00:49:11,990
we'll also be will have the sanded panel

1298
00:49:09,530 --> 00:49:13,400
with Omega also appear the first I

1299
00:49:11,990 --> 00:49:17,029
thought that'll be nice under his real

1300
00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:20,200

1305
00:49:32,210 --> 00:49:37,640
yeah so bye guys I just want to ask you

1306
00:49:35,810 --> 00:49:40,790
a question about Julian Assange if

1307
00:49:37,640 --> 00:49:43,250
that's okay yeah so from the book I sort

1308
00:49:40,790 --> 00:49:45,140
of interpreted that he was a somewhat

1309
00:49:43,250 --> 00:49:46,740
legitimate hacker although there is

1310
00:49:45,140 --> 00:49:49,140
distained towards him

1311
00:49:46,740 --> 00:49:51,540
here I just heard that you guys were

1312
00:49:49,140 --> 00:49:53,700
saying that he was asking for exploits

1313
00:49:51,540 --> 00:49:55,050
on IRC I just want to know if he could

1314
00:49:53,700 --> 00:49:57,689
maybe he sort of clarify the year a

1315
00:49:55,050 --> 00:50:00,480
little bit about why maybe what he

1316
00:49:57,690 --> 00:50:02,970
really was from a more objective what

1317
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:04,770
did you huh I mean he definitely was a

1318
00:50:02,970 --> 00:50:07,290
legitimate hacker I mean he hates the

1319
00:50:04,770 --> 00:50:08,790
skills I mean he you know he won't

1320
00:50:07,290 --> 00:50:12,060
whether the first port scanners strobe

1321
00:50:08,790 --> 00:50:13,740

1322
00:50:12,060 --> 00:50:16,859

1323

1337
00:50:45,720 --> 00:50:49,259
dumb question

1338
00:50:46,349 --> 00:50:51,089
oh you know I gotta say my own politics

1339
00:50:49,260 --> 00:50:54,570
are significantly to the left of Beddoes

1340
00:50:51,089 --> 00:50:56,130
however I can say you know you vote you

1341
00:50:54,570 --> 00:50:57,900
political aside you know whatever you

1342
00:50:56,130 --> 00:50:59,460
support my own point of view is that

1343
00:50:57,900 --> 00:51:02,310
that he is an honest and genuine person

1344
00:50:59,460 --> 00:51:05,250
as I say my politics er to his left but

1345
00:51:02,310 --> 00:51:07,920
when you know I trust her through my own

1346
00:51:05,250 --> 00:51:09,630
experience with him that what he says he

1347
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:11,130
actually believes he's not pandering

1348
00:51:09,630 --> 00:51:13,349
that's actually what he believes and so

1349
00:51:11,130 --> 00:51:14,460
if that's if that happens to align with

1350
00:51:13,349 --> 00:51:16,260
who you believe then vote for a better

1351
00:51:14,460 --> 00:51:17,310
work or it's just if it doesn't align

1352
00:51:16,260 --> 00:51:22,290
with oh you believe in don't vote for

1353
00:51:17,310 --> 00:51:23,580
better or org it was legit yeah yeah my

1354
00:51:22,290 --> 00:51:24,509
answer is we have a private voting

1355
00:51:23,580 --> 00:51:26,220
system where you don't have to tell

1356
00:51:24,510 --> 00:51:28,830
people your voice it's really important

1357
00:51:26,220 --> 00:51:30,299
and I swear by that yeah so I'll never

1358
00:51:28,830 --> 00:51:32,700
tell you who I vote for I'll tell you

1359
00:51:30,300 --> 00:51:34,710

1360
