00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,449
welcome back from lunch everybody hope

2
00:00:01,949 --> 00:00:05,040
you had a good time got a couple of

3
00:00:03,449 --> 00:00:06,689
quick announcements before we start if

4
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:08,610
you haven't already please mute your

5
00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:09,719
cell phone so that everybody else

6
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:12,030
doesn't have to listen while you

7
00:00:09,719 --> 00:00:13,379
scramble to get it you did if you

8
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:15,088
haven't been down to the business hall

9
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:17,279
you'll want to check that out on level 2

10
00:00:15,089 --> 00:00:18,810
down in the ballrooms go visit the

11
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:20,910
vendors and let them know that you

12
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:23,189
appreciate their sponsorship also

13
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:23,970
tonight the pony awards are gonna be in

14
00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:27,330
lagoon

15
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:29,009
JKL at 6:30 if you don't know where

16
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:30,419
that's at find any of the guys with the

17
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:32,009
blue t-shirts running around the

18
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:34,800
conference associates can do a great job

19
00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:39,690
of helping you find your way right now

20
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:42,629
you are in South Seas cdf the the next

21
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:45,269
talk we have is all the 4g modules could

22
00:00:42,629 --> 00:00:52,349
be hacked and our speakers are shooting

23
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:55,230
al and Changwon yes okay

24
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:56,989
this talk is also photo motors could be

25
00:00:55,230 --> 00:01:00,390
hacked

26
00:00:56,989 --> 00:01:06,149
without him and we are from the beta

27
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:09,090
security lab I'm some home I'm ok

28
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:12,960
let me introduce agenda altered a stock

29
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:15,509
of us so we will introduce the

30
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:18,389
fundamental of the 40 modules secondly

31
00:01:15,509 --> 00:01:21,990
review 20 of the newer tests of it with

32
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:25,200
a 40 module and the so limited Trust

33
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:27,619
what needed to be done in order to carry

34
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:30,689
out a successful attack for example

35
00:01:27,619 --> 00:01:33,570
optional firmware occurs Rachelle and

36
00:01:30,689 --> 00:01:35,758
some and the first we will talk about

37
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:38,669
her various ways to discover the

38
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:40,140
vulnerabilities and last we will provide

39
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:45,259
some better defense

40
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:48,180
practice-based our appearance okay

41
00:01:45,259 --> 00:01:51,119
this future show you more than 30

42
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:54,630
various for the models and the us's we

43
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:57,780
have started to know about about some

44
00:01:54,630 --> 00:02:01,229
photo routing device and some recovery

45
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:04,259
devices yes many one bit is over the

46
00:02:01,229 --> 00:02:06,789
photo module we mentioned today also it

47
00:02:04,259 --> 00:02:09,280
is on family in the mid

48
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:12,580
the awesome tattoo boxes and the some

49
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:15,370
part of method to diverse it down the

50
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:19,420
bottom we all can a brand or for the

51
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:25,900
module about a certain can motto PC a

52
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:28,690
innovate and LCC packages with what we

53
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:34,900
have found with her from several general

54
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:37,780
one bitches is different expand and some

55
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:42,310
risk in several midwife surgeon models

56
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:45,070
and SAE in modern fail castables and the

57
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:48,340
various I'm the one person in our path

58
00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:51,609
of folding model because mobility repair

59
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:55,660
is a long process so we just show you

60
00:02:51,610 --> 00:03:01,270
the volume playtest we have which have

61
00:02:55,660 --> 00:03:04,060
been fixed in this slide okay what we do

62
00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:06,550
this that info so we found that a lot

63
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:08,920
many people held down we're going to

64
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:11,410
research in this diversion before and

65
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:13,660
the no one is aware of the security

66
00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:16,329
problem and why the impact of the

67
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:17,320
foreign model so we want to shed a lot

68
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:19,989
on Motty

69
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:22,480
the direction of secure research for

70
00:03:19,989 --> 00:03:24,670
example trust now have a child or

71
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:29,200
networking fashions but it's in that

72
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:31,899
NOAA has attracted the typicality CEO

73
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:34,630
they are also security issues with a

74
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:37,360
span abyss panda security really

75
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:39,730
important researchers really talk about

76
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:42,760
the peacefulness security or kokum and

77
00:03:39,730 --> 00:03:46,540
sensor in fact there are many other

78
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:50,310
peaceful achieves such as Intel for ATT

79
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:53,859
antique a memory book and saw and

80
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:58,239
compared with the mobile first I see

81
00:03:53,860 --> 00:04:00,040
easier to another so the 40 model so we

82
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:03,940
were also introduced some new and

83
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:06,579
effective attacks surface and method in

84
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:09,670
short ago understand not only to

85
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:12,400
introduce some special one basic of the

86
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:14,828
four-day model but also to provide you

87
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:18,000
with some new ideas a method for

88
00:04:14,829 --> 00:04:18,000
successful at health

89
00:04:18,699 --> 00:04:23,800
we can see the photo model everywhere

90
00:04:21,129 --> 00:04:27,159
IOT devices called kinetic of the

91
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:29,590
illness or the Ford Motor for example we

92
00:04:27,159 --> 00:04:32,560
can control our car remotely by the EVP

93
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:35,498
it seems a communication system of the

94
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:39,029
cap is an other time maybe some process

95
00:04:35,499 --> 00:04:42,460
is it a polishing and Montes

96
00:04:39,029 --> 00:04:45,610
long-running TV connection via other

97
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:49,270
devices such like for Trevathan for the

98
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:53,169
neutral ticket of any emotion our laptop

99
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:57,549
and some integer diversity even the slot

100
00:04:53,169 --> 00:05:01,539
machines in Las Vegas the as monestery

101
00:04:57,550 --> 00:05:05,710
interface in fact the internal structure

102
00:05:01,539 --> 00:05:08,139
is the same we will see later on the

103
00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:10,060
latter is a circuit about the structure

104
00:05:08,139 --> 00:05:13,509
of the vending machine we can see a

105
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:18,219
motor with PC mini PCIe interface plug

106
00:05:13,509 --> 00:05:21,909
in and read this actually um process

107
00:05:18,219 --> 00:05:23,650
multiple really knows our Android system

108
00:05:21,909 --> 00:05:25,930
angle dress is each other

109
00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:29,049
motor series of 40 model which

110
00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:31,120
implements navigation apparel most

111
00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:33,639
control system accurate and other

112
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:39,339
versions the model is attached directly

113
00:05:33,639 --> 00:05:43,000
to the motherboard in this slide on the

114
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:45,509
left is a natural for the route we can

115
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:49,029
see that there is a mini PC interface

116
00:05:45,509 --> 00:05:52,479
module on the motherboard in fact is the

117
00:05:49,029 --> 00:05:56,199
kamasutra as throughout to implement the

118
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:58,568
fracture or intro internet were set the

119
00:05:56,199 --> 00:06:02,110
device on the red is the bit special

120
00:05:58,569 --> 00:06:05,050
it's a pub it's approached by very

121
00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:08,909
diverse but it doesn't help us

122
00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:12,879
staff lords of fortune model it uses TTL

123
00:06:08,909 --> 00:06:15,729
cursive Chad chieftain in fact it's also

124
00:06:12,879 --> 00:06:20,229
a for the model achieve in the module is

125
00:06:15,729 --> 00:06:22,599
attached to the PCB but which implements

126
00:06:20,229 --> 00:06:25,740
networking driving Wi-Fi

127
00:06:22,599 --> 00:06:28,300
running ATP service and other fashion

128
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:29,669
there are many other devices that it

129
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:34,020
done in this way

130
00:06:29,669 --> 00:06:36,120
such as some local 40 Newton okay let's

131
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:39,240
look at the structure of the forum model

132
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:42,360
in fact the 40 model is a company at her

133
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:43,520
computer Satyam am CEO and the piece

134
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:46,860
Pennisetum

135
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:49,849
integrated in the main control chip they

136
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:53,849
are used in the flesh which has a large

137
00:06:49,849 --> 00:06:56,159
storage space and the low cost and the

138
00:06:53,849 --> 00:06:59,490
other shapes such as a power management

139
00:06:56,159 --> 00:07:02,400
radio from KC chip and so on

140
00:06:59,490 --> 00:07:06,210
legend tells the software model with a

141
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:11,460
14 model embedded you know Satyam and a

142
00:07:06,210 --> 00:07:14,039
few at us system this is a picture of

143
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:16,799
the internal structure of the co come

144
00:07:14,039 --> 00:07:20,219
easy to the ER model with the top of

145
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:23,939
shader remove the memory chip is ad

146
00:07:20,219 --> 00:07:26,969
flash plus dr am memory which is the

147
00:07:23,939 --> 00:07:31,289
integrated intuitive by looking at the

148
00:07:26,969 --> 00:07:35,039
modules Petrovna model the flash is the

149
00:07:31,289 --> 00:07:38,039
BG basics to pin if we are true with our

150
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:43,318
modify the data instead we need to buy

151
00:07:38,039 --> 00:07:46,050
our correspondence cable socket so how

152
00:07:43,319 --> 00:07:50,069
do the model work and how should they be

153
00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:54,289
used we can see the upper lateral tunnel

154
00:07:50,069 --> 00:07:57,210
it's the LCC module from the terminology

155
00:07:54,289 --> 00:08:00,449
they build a minimal system for it

156
00:07:57,210 --> 00:08:01,770
including power suppliers in car

157
00:08:00,449 --> 00:08:06,419
European her face

158
00:08:01,770 --> 00:08:10,680
yes ulti versus communicate with the 40

159
00:08:06,419 --> 00:08:13,289
model using USB cable first when you're

160
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:16,439
to install the corresponding travels in

161
00:08:13,289 --> 00:08:19,259
the operating system when the module is

162
00:08:16,439 --> 00:08:22,740
plugged in the operating system load

163
00:08:19,259 --> 00:08:27,240
corresponding travel according to the

164
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:31,219
VAD PID and interface number generator

165
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:37,640
mode generous network card and the gas

166
00:08:31,219 --> 00:08:37,640
corresponding IP address the internet

167
00:08:39,019 --> 00:08:43,230
then the for the model your list powder

168
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:46,440
multiple connection

169
00:08:43,230 --> 00:08:49,920
and each mode has a different color more

170
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:53,730
module Travis for example the upper part

171
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:57,900
of the slide shows the PPP and I mean he

172
00:08:53,730 --> 00:09:00,720
mode when the Italian is successful the

173
00:08:57,900 --> 00:09:03,740
US will cos I P address from operate

174
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:07,640
just like the out hit us directly at a

175
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:10,710
public IP address hey Wendy ro

176
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:13,980
neighborhood stickman is also considered

177
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:18,260
a public network address another way for

178
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:21,690
example in India saw Easter is a mode

179
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:24,960
the photo module your Lehigh has to

180
00:09:21,690 --> 00:09:27,300
network at when tears fall so to get the

181
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:30,810
public IP address from operate and

182
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:33,839
another network card is connected to the

183
00:09:30,810 --> 00:09:36,089
ltte us using the natural network a

184
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:40,410
seaman it looks as the photo model

185
00:09:36,090 --> 00:09:43,590
becames Rooter and alerted us says

186
00:09:40,410 --> 00:09:46,860
international it Sutra the second part

187
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:50,190
is about this time of death here a mock

188
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:52,680
the the ADI are in the US and the ether

189
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:56,160
mode because they tomb of the total

190
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:59,069
repair additional chair was particularly

191
00:09:56,160 --> 00:10:03,589
convenient to us so now most of a

192
00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:06,330
foreign model are early are using this

193
00:10:03,590 --> 00:10:09,840
muscle the photo module are using this

194
00:10:06,330 --> 00:10:13,200
mode the typical the tea box in the try

195
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:16,350
this way so you'll see the security of

196
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:19,620
the foreign model has turned into the

197
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:24,960
security the minutes a Tomo a poder in

198
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:30,030
the network ok let's introduce some new

199
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:33,570
attack surface as I said earlier that

200
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:37,949
muscle for the motor hi were embedded in

201
00:10:33,570 --> 00:10:42,740
those items so where is the operating

202
00:10:37,950 --> 00:10:48,480
system many reason such as in supporting

203
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:51,870
to 340 which requires computing resource

204
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:54,780
and the phone Tonto auto mode power

205
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:59,820
automobile manufacturers often need to

206
00:10:54,780 --> 00:11:03,720
run their own programs and own programs

207
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:05,970
in Tabasco to achieve motor control and

208
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:11,310
other fashions we should because the

209
00:11:05,970 --> 00:11:14,130
motorways the secondary development now

210
00:11:11,310 --> 00:11:17,339
less than a Lynette the attacks of it

211
00:11:14,130 --> 00:11:20,430
all foreign model as we sell just nam of

212
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:23,190
the California model our company turning

213
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:26,579
upon your system at the same time we

214
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:29,310
found that a motor module now use and

215
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:33,210
the as our SM has working mode it means

216
00:11:29,310 --> 00:11:37,140
that the module will be a sin separated

217
00:11:33,210 --> 00:11:39,810
IP address this progress or chance of

218
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:42,240
attacked minions oppinions operating

219
00:11:39,810 --> 00:11:45,449
system often has some little impulse or

220
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:48,960
connect to the cloud for OTA updates or

221
00:11:45,450 --> 00:11:53,040
most amendments now it has a separate IP

222
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:56,820
we can directly assess the spouse inter

223
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:59,459
interrupt interceptor is opening and the

224
00:11:56,820 --> 00:12:03,630
twosome mighty-armed attacks and so on

225
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:06,810
so now the sector is essentially the

226
00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:10,470
task all to analyze the hottest item

227
00:12:06,810 --> 00:12:15,479
security when the linear house in order

228
00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:17,370
to internet or intranet but wait in the

229
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:20,640
sim that we can reserve with the

230
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:26,100
separate IP unless in the same

231
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:29,370
such as weather hotspot so let's talk

232
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:34,110
about some extended attacker surface a

233
00:12:29,370 --> 00:12:37,260
fortune module is a very secular device

234
00:12:34,110 --> 00:12:40,470
connect to the operators network but

235
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:43,530
some operators due to configuration

236
00:12:40,470 --> 00:12:47,220
errors don't have networkers

237
00:12:43,530 --> 00:12:50,579
isolation so calendar can assess the IP

238
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:53,880
or other device and all these the

239
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:57,480
foreign models about 2g GSM mode because

240
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:59,520
of the security problem of 3sm we can

241
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:03,180
use the effect based nation to monitor

242
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:06,460
and modify traffic so also care of her

243
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:08,500
IP links and losses pause and

244
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:12,010
there are also many third-party services

245
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:17,640
added to the mod module such as car

246
00:13:12,010 --> 00:13:21,610
control service let's summarize the

247
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:24,730
ideas photo we need to collect enough

248
00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:28,209
information and below it's an

249
00:13:24,730 --> 00:13:32,230
affirmative on abilities so Kesha from

250
00:13:28,209 --> 00:13:35,770
Maryland analysis Onassis and so on that

251
00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:38,980
may be a lot of reverse engineer worker

252
00:13:35,770 --> 00:13:43,420
here mainly analyzing the part the

253
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:45,580
process of various listening post the

254
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:48,520
they need to consider how to our

255
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:51,250
attacker code and introduced to the

256
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:54,339
traditional traditional methods many in

257
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:57,130
land network such as Wi-Fi hotspot to

258
00:13:54,339 --> 00:14:01,630
assert the part of the forty model to

259
00:13:57,130 --> 00:14:03,970
attack and the new attack method we can

260
00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:07,600
use the correct for configuration or the

261
00:14:03,970 --> 00:14:10,830
operator network to transform the local

262
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:14,200
land attacks into a very wide range of

263
00:14:10,830 --> 00:14:17,620
modular attacks which can generate her

264
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:21,190
increase the scope of attacks in

265
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:24,760
addition because a tourist board we have

266
00:14:21,190 --> 00:14:27,130
a way to control appealing to the nearby

267
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:29,290
for a model with hang directly assess

268
00:14:27,130 --> 00:14:32,560
each part and we are would have some

269
00:14:29,290 --> 00:14:38,860
code with this thirteen ideas it seems

270
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:41,949
very easy to attach the forty model ok

271
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:44,860
let's first talk about utf-8 position

272
00:14:41,950 --> 00:14:47,020
foot attached because client can't and

273
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:50,680
despair whether the base station is the

274
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:53,290
real or not in GSM network we can build

275
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:56,229
a Fink position system to attach under

276
00:14:53,290 --> 00:14:58,510
control traffic in certainly this hotel

277
00:14:56,230 --> 00:15:02,170
is effective for all foreign models and

278
00:14:58,510 --> 00:15:05,560
the formal we will proceed for long time

279
00:15:02,170 --> 00:15:09,130
regardless of whether the operator shut

280
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:11,199
down the Fuji base station or not it's

281
00:15:09,130 --> 00:15:14,079
too difficult to build a fake base

282
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:15,459
station but previously people have not

283
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:18,849
sought the

284
00:15:15,459 --> 00:15:22,179
problem or automatic auto attachment if

285
00:15:18,850 --> 00:15:25,860
we doesn't attach automatically grants

286
00:15:22,179 --> 00:15:31,209
need to slide to the physician manually

287
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:34,959
in spared studio pay station in China we

288
00:15:31,209 --> 00:15:39,368
can improve the settle programmer for

289
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:42,008
Mitra in gs in GSM broadcasting channel

290
00:15:39,369 --> 00:15:44,980
and the trend will automatically connect

291
00:15:42,009 --> 00:15:49,720
to our Fink be station say to investor

292
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:52,240
resurrection program Mitra the larger

293
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:57,040
the value of the more client attend to

294
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:59,889
connect with the base station we can

295
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:02,469
build our fee base station where our

296
00:15:59,889 --> 00:16:07,290
software will do such as the plate RF

297
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:10,689
and espcs system but we need to chance

298
00:16:07,290 --> 00:16:13,540
changes value of state for this super

299
00:16:10,689 --> 00:16:15,969
ammeter is not a set a new year to pts

300
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:20,199
so that's hardly call inter in the

301
00:16:15,970 --> 00:16:24,610
source code set it to maximum and we

302
00:16:20,199 --> 00:16:27,399
complete here when you truly manual that

303
00:16:24,610 --> 00:16:29,799
is illegal to build a fake base station

304
00:16:27,399 --> 00:16:34,149
although this or tell you verified you

305
00:16:29,799 --> 00:16:40,059
you can test in the shin box and show in

306
00:16:34,149 --> 00:16:42,429
the finger on the red dot for for the

307
00:16:40,059 --> 00:16:44,639
temporary or for the motor to truly you

308
00:16:42,429 --> 00:16:48,850
need the triple the inter

309
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:51,279
interfere with software view software

310
00:16:48,850 --> 00:16:54,339
radio equipment as such as standing firm

311
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:56,679
or a white and all the interference in

312
00:16:54,339 --> 00:16:58,959
the current Authority and the for deep

313
00:16:56,679 --> 00:17:02,470
and it's also illegal

314
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:05,168
you just need to know that this method

315
00:17:02,470 --> 00:17:08,110
is effective finally the foreign model

316
00:17:05,169 --> 00:17:10,029
ultimate automatically attached to our

317
00:17:08,109 --> 00:17:13,839
filter station leather

318
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:16,209
wop wop hop the lower Dresner finger

319
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:20,020
shows that a stateful value is already

320
00:17:16,209 --> 00:17:23,140
very high your lay around the 70 so now

321
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:26,709
we can now fully control the IP lingual

322
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:29,559
monitor all the IP data transmission

323
00:17:26,709 --> 00:17:33,070
says the pointer rally part and modify

324
00:17:29,559 --> 00:17:36,639
that date the most common approach are

325
00:17:33,070 --> 00:17:40,049
used in Tula said the past such as SSH

326
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:40,049
and other service

327
00:17:40,270 --> 00:17:47,590
now let's how about to attack a

328
00:17:42,190 --> 00:17:50,529
co-operators it operators intranet which

329
00:17:47,590 --> 00:17:53,379
are just implement in a pink suit or

330
00:17:50,529 --> 00:17:57,179
sell the nearby diversity but you do a

331
00:17:53,380 --> 00:18:00,760
way to attacker remotely most operators

332
00:17:57,179 --> 00:18:04,149
of interior oven seven to an annual

333
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:06,640
Kassim under arrest for clans but many

334
00:18:04,149 --> 00:18:10,928
of them are tuned to me to not have a

335
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:14,350
network isolation such as China Unicom

336
00:18:10,929 --> 00:18:16,419
and China Telecom at the same time most

337
00:18:14,350 --> 00:18:19,120
of photo module don't have a farewell

338
00:18:16,419 --> 00:18:22,029
enabled this means that we can't

339
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:25,090
directly assess the pothole other

340
00:18:22,029 --> 00:18:27,669
occurrences of the post get the future

341
00:18:25,090 --> 00:18:30,309
under data is the result of the Kenya

342
00:18:27,669 --> 00:18:33,159
open house or ADB and the talent

343
00:18:30,309 --> 00:18:36,210
services on the intranet or the operator

344
00:18:33,159 --> 00:18:41,919
you can tell there are many kinds of how

345
00:18:36,210 --> 00:18:44,679
those paths open mode intentionally we

346
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:48,669
can manage rather than attackers through

347
00:18:44,679 --> 00:18:52,029
private private appian forest if here is

348
00:18:48,669 --> 00:18:54,970
the technology that translate connected

349
00:18:52,029 --> 00:18:57,850
to their intranet server directly so

350
00:18:54,970 --> 00:19:00,909
operators the tunnel just like for the

351
00:18:57,850 --> 00:19:04,658
VPN connection client and the server

352
00:19:00,909 --> 00:19:08,140
communication with each other so when 0

353
00:19:04,659 --> 00:19:11,649
last image special SIM card and ATM or

354
00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:14,710
cell phones are third it's an all

355
00:19:11,649 --> 00:19:18,250
connection is the well adoptable muscle

356
00:19:14,710 --> 00:19:21,610
car companies and combination among the

357
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:24,929
new LG equipments such as China's new

358
00:19:21,610 --> 00:19:28,418
Bhavana motion and cons in this

359
00:19:24,929 --> 00:19:31,600
intranet are equipped with the sims have

360
00:19:28,419 --> 00:19:35,670
all made by the same company so we can

361
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:39,330
look for one ability in such diverse the

362
00:19:35,670 --> 00:19:45,510
Massive Attack's I saw result we can

363
00:19:39,330 --> 00:19:47,699
full control over all these diverse so

364
00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:50,820
how can we get the configuration of the

365
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:53,850
apiary loss le Pont for example so from

366
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:57,540
where I'm an access and allow an asset

367
00:19:53,850 --> 00:20:00,780
and how to connect a key to a previous

368
00:19:57,540 --> 00:20:01,620
aperian network we can detect is

369
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:04,260
imageable

370
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:07,679
on the motherboard then attach it back

371
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:10,650
to our foreign model and use the 80

372
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:13,950
commander to configure the correct APA

373
00:20:10,650 --> 00:20:16,050
Excel pond so now we can connect with

374
00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:18,390
the manufacturers will provide a peon

375
00:20:16,050 --> 00:20:23,639
network and the start of the apostolate

376
00:20:18,390 --> 00:20:26,220
and the height attractor introduce some

377
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:32,310
new tile surface less a parent or a

378
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:34,770
teacher preparation work to get ready

379
00:20:32,310 --> 00:20:37,409
for assess who attacked you need to

380
00:20:34,770 --> 00:20:40,850
complete at least aware of the volume

381
00:20:37,410 --> 00:20:44,850
gets reformer that's a share and

382
00:20:40,850 --> 00:20:47,929
optional traffic in general calendar

383
00:20:44,850 --> 00:20:50,639
share is motoring in facial and

384
00:20:47,930 --> 00:20:53,310
advocating the shell is easier to gather

385
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:55,920
from where and the net rotate but

386
00:20:53,310 --> 00:21:00,899
sometimes it's not always be possible

387
00:20:55,920 --> 00:21:04,070
together share that total closer to look

388
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:04,070
at how to achieve it

389
00:21:04,970 --> 00:21:12,210
photo have you introduced several method

390
00:21:07,950 --> 00:21:15,120
for up to opt-in know from where if this

391
00:21:12,210 --> 00:21:20,610
method don't work there is a team water

392
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:22,770
method LED flash damn we can cancel

393
00:21:20,610 --> 00:21:25,050
former birth downloading the for my

394
00:21:22,770 --> 00:21:28,530
appetizer program from the official

395
00:21:25,050 --> 00:21:31,770
website and unpacking it the fingers all

396
00:21:28,530 --> 00:21:35,100
the firmware update program or burner

397
00:21:31,770 --> 00:21:39,120
for gerry rafferty death we easily get

398
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:42,080
the Linux Linux system or partition

399
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:48,229
partition inside by unpacking

400
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:51,260
the reactive fell with BMO the former

401
00:21:48,230 --> 00:21:54,070
can be obtained so the manufacturers

402
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:56,510
upgrade that was most mental health

403
00:21:54,070 --> 00:22:00,200
manufacturers I will provide either

404
00:21:56,510 --> 00:22:03,740
upgrade atutor to the developers for

405
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:06,890
example comes the module have needed

406
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:09,799
there a recovery mode which is the set

407
00:22:06,890 --> 00:22:13,880
of partial to a circuit and most other

408
00:22:09,799 --> 00:22:18,190
points we can get a date hurtful from

409
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:26,899
vendor Texas about which which

410
00:22:18,190 --> 00:22:30,200
initialization phase of partition we can

411
00:22:26,899 --> 00:22:33,279
see that the tool contains initial image

412
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:39,440
our partitions we need auto focus system

413
00:22:33,279 --> 00:22:42,950
town OMG this values uses UPF f you

414
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:47,480
BRFSS first item we can use the UPA

415
00:22:42,950 --> 00:22:50,210
reader to to successfully extracted the

416
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:57,320
file format and the catalyst final

417
00:22:50,210 --> 00:23:00,350
linear sales item if we if we can't get

418
00:22:57,320 --> 00:23:04,970
upgraded for there is a team water

419
00:23:00,350 --> 00:23:09,620
solution NT flash Tampa any fresher is

420
00:23:04,970 --> 00:23:13,510
more compile complex to read and the

421
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:17,959
modified EMS a flash a lower resolution

422
00:23:13,510 --> 00:23:21,049
is common PJs accessories chip it's very

423
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:26,659
small and needs a special ad programmer

424
00:23:21,049 --> 00:23:29,860
to read and write at redemption of the

425
00:23:26,659 --> 00:23:33,610
chip we can use to be involved to and

426
00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:33,610
identify the future

427
00:23:35,929 --> 00:23:40,760
let's introduce how to gather share were

428
00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:44,090
to be able to Kasia

429
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:47,090
if we can get a shell we it will be more

430
00:23:44,090 --> 00:23:49,889
convenient fast who will process the

431
00:23:47,090 --> 00:23:53,610
first Network and the debugger one about

432
00:23:49,890 --> 00:23:57,000
from programs it's very treating that

433
00:23:53,610 --> 00:24:00,689
manifold remodel use the common password

434
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:03,210
or administer one two three and in this

435
00:24:00,690 --> 00:24:06,660
in some time the password may not be

436
00:24:03,210 --> 00:24:08,940
required in addition to still report you

437
00:24:06,660 --> 00:24:13,230
can also use some remote management

438
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:16,590
tools such as ADB telnet SS agents and

439
00:24:13,230 --> 00:24:22,740
so on this service can be obtained by

440
00:24:16,590 --> 00:24:26,010
ports Kenya other methods such as

441
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:29,910
getting a cell phone from 80 commander

442
00:24:26,010 --> 00:24:32,190
after the module is nested the USB

443
00:24:29,910 --> 00:24:36,059
interface may appear Warshaw less

444
00:24:32,190 --> 00:24:40,520
business several see reports such as T V

445
00:24:36,059 --> 00:24:43,770
T tau 0 so which attic man can be sent

446
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:45,929
according to the menu we can send a team

447
00:24:43,770 --> 00:24:50,190
commander to open the adb stories of

448
00:24:45,929 --> 00:24:55,500
some module could excuse system

449
00:24:50,190 --> 00:24:58,620
movements or the austenitic man even not

450
00:24:55,500 --> 00:25:01,350
all this work we still have our team

451
00:24:58,620 --> 00:25:04,889
will survey to modify any flash

452
00:25:01,350 --> 00:25:07,949
I'd turn data processor to the start a

453
00:25:04,890 --> 00:25:13,950
Perl script and we attached a midi

454
00:25:07,950 --> 00:25:16,169
flashback let's look at how to get a

455
00:25:13,950 --> 00:25:19,140
networker traffic we can build

456
00:25:16,169 --> 00:25:21,840
affordable station Satyam where is the

457
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:24,570
photo base station because it's yota for

458
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:27,870
research compared with to the base

459
00:25:24,570 --> 00:25:32,100
station building affordably open more

460
00:25:27,870 --> 00:25:34,820
stable community and fat as you can see

461
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:37,949
in the finger on the res Oakland

462
00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:41,220
automatically connect to the affordable

463
00:25:37,950 --> 00:25:43,760
station and gasps the IP address we can

464
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:48,330
use the wizard to monitor the traffic

465
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:51,480
videos as as far as out his for the pay

466
00:25:48,330 --> 00:25:53,689
station Satyam in this method which in

467
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:59,309
much more convenient

468
00:25:53,690 --> 00:26:01,179
installation there only a family friend

469
00:25:59,309 --> 00:26:04,749
anonymity the true

470
00:26:01,179 --> 00:26:07,989
to read a SIM card we need to pay a

471
00:26:04,749 --> 00:26:12,009
response SIM card and the reader not

472
00:26:07,989 --> 00:26:15,129
that this SIM cards are only used for

473
00:26:12,009 --> 00:26:21,009
security attention not for other illegal

474
00:26:15,129 --> 00:26:23,709
sales we need to dress the collector a

475
00:26:21,009 --> 00:26:26,799
mess IKEA and oh he threw the same

476
00:26:23,710 --> 00:26:31,109
harder to ensure that little parameters

477
00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:34,210
are the same as those in the SRS LTE

478
00:26:31,109 --> 00:26:37,749
family we start our for the base station

479
00:26:34,210 --> 00:26:40,659
and the eto workers the perfected in

480
00:26:37,749 --> 00:26:43,029
fact no matter whether is a to day basis

481
00:26:40,659 --> 00:26:45,570
or for the bass station II took a test a

482
00:26:43,029 --> 00:26:48,969
large number of configuration items

483
00:26:45,570 --> 00:26:52,678
Tamil relations in this talk we only you

484
00:26:48,969 --> 00:26:52,679
to learn the motor important to you

485
00:26:53,320 --> 00:27:02,859
not less our recap what information can

486
00:26:57,249 --> 00:27:05,619
we get from this preparation most likely

487
00:27:02,859 --> 00:27:07,869
the share will be captured then the

488
00:27:05,619 --> 00:27:11,769
firmware system and the network traffic

489
00:27:07,869 --> 00:27:14,830
will certainly be captured these are

490
00:27:11,769 --> 00:27:21,029
essential for the follow-up of

491
00:27:14,830 --> 00:27:21,029
vulnerability menu ok

492
00:27:32,810 --> 00:27:38,870
okay so home just talked a lot about the

493
00:27:36,470 --> 00:27:41,890
attack surface and preparation for

494
00:27:38,870 --> 00:27:44,360
attacking 4G models now let me choose

495
00:27:41,890 --> 00:27:49,040
critical vulnerabilities we found in

496
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:52,760
detail let's focus on system management

497
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:56,030
service when abilities first usually 4G

498
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:58,580
models run Linux system Linux system

499
00:27:56,030 --> 00:28:05,090
start many remote management services

500
00:27:58,580 --> 00:28:09,199
such as SSH tell that and web server we

501
00:28:05,090 --> 00:28:12,230
can use fast controls like masking which

502
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:16,850
can scan the open supports opening

503
00:28:12,230 --> 00:28:21,920
status in just a few minutes for example

504
00:28:16,850 --> 00:28:25,310
we found a 4G module open port 23 which

505
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:28,820
means the term of service is started in

506
00:28:25,310 --> 00:28:33,230
most cases telnet need password to login

507
00:28:28,820 --> 00:28:35,899
we can extract extract etc' password

508
00:28:33,230 --> 00:28:39,770
file from the firmware and then cracked

509
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:42,290
it by using her she care tours and if

510
00:28:39,770 --> 00:28:45,580
you reach you can buy a lot of GPO to

511
00:28:42,290 --> 00:28:49,159
speed up the crack the 4G modules

512
00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:51,639
January are not using one machine one

513
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:55,610
secret key or one secret password

514
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:58,610
strategy so if you successfully crack

515
00:28:55,610 --> 00:29:01,040
the password which means that you have

516
00:28:58,610 --> 00:29:04,760
just cracked the password of all 4G

517
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:07,310
modules of this manufactures once we get

518
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:10,100
the password you can successfully login

519
00:29:07,310 --> 00:29:16,100
to the system remotely so that the

520
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:18,469
device is ours in addition we found that

521
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:23,480
many well-known manufacturer of 4G

522
00:29:18,470 --> 00:29:26,840
models have open remote ADB services by

523
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:27,910
default we only need some of them in

524
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:33,459
this table

525
00:29:27,910 --> 00:29:38,620
in fact some automobile manufacturer

526
00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:41,810
also open remote ADB so ICS by default

527
00:29:38,620 --> 00:29:44,439
what's the consequence of this we can

528
00:29:41,810 --> 00:29:48,480
simply use adb tools to connect

529
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:53,320
five five five five port of this module

530
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:57,130
we can simply log into the system

531
00:29:53,320 --> 00:30:02,310
without ostentation as usually it has no

532
00:29:57,130 --> 00:30:05,200
password and we can get a share remotely

533
00:30:02,310 --> 00:30:06,700
there are many other type of system

534
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:11,260
management services

535
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:15,000
well abilities such as weak password for

536
00:30:11,260 --> 00:30:18,190
web management services and even SSH

537
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:21,580
services that do not require password I

538
00:30:18,190 --> 00:30:24,610
founded it on some car and some

539
00:30:21,580 --> 00:30:27,909
manufacturers in order to convenient

540
00:30:24,610 --> 00:30:30,070
repair the repair you know to

541
00:30:27,910 --> 00:30:33,280
convenience repair of their 40 modules

542
00:30:30,070 --> 00:30:37,149
they hide they hide backdoor in some

543
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:39,790
external monitoring port maybe you can

544
00:30:37,150 --> 00:30:40,900
use the back door to open telnet or to

545
00:30:39,790 --> 00:30:44,620
something dangerous

546
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:51,340
I will talk about an interesting case

547
00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:53,370
like this on the next page as you see we

548
00:30:51,340 --> 00:30:53,370
found

549
00:30:59,610 --> 00:31:07,500
we found this this world variability six

550
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:10,030
years six months ago will report it to

551
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:13,230
manufacturers and the manufacturer has

552
00:31:10,030 --> 00:31:13,230
fixed it already

553
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:26,860
this part was the manufacturer Hydra

554
00:31:17,620 --> 00:31:35,409
vector in a port in a port sorry this

555
00:31:26,860 --> 00:31:39,399
lutely lose the 50s after I was

556
00:31:35,410 --> 00:31:45,280
engineering we found a port monitoring

557
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:49,110
in four or five sorry I backed into

558
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:49,110
another pivoting

559
00:32:12,270 --> 00:32:17,690
okay sure pusher

560
00:32:19,610 --> 00:32:28,409
in the nowadays we found many cars has a

561
00:32:23,790 --> 00:32:31,860
PPS the a PP can issue open his window

562
00:32:28,410 --> 00:32:36,140
or open his engine remotely or remote

563
00:32:31,860 --> 00:32:40,590
unlock the car from the mobile from a PP

564
00:32:36,140 --> 00:32:44,940
we found so we back away by our key box

565
00:32:40,590 --> 00:32:48,120
from ought to pass jobs and we recall

566
00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:54,090
the tea box we found it was not open a

567
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:59,219
DB or telnet but a we found is listening

568
00:32:54,090 --> 00:33:03,470
on a port 1 8 xx port and we found the

569
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:09,720
ping and using to him about the USB a

570
00:33:03,470 --> 00:33:12,740
USB ADB the bug report and will we so we

571
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:16,830
get a share when user successfully

572
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:19,590
logged into this linear system and we

573
00:33:16,830 --> 00:33:25,199
found less than another process

574
00:33:19,590 --> 00:33:29,010
listening port 2 5 2 4 X X X and we use

575
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:31,890
idea to analysis this port this this

576
00:33:29,010 --> 00:33:40,500
program we found tell that related

577
00:33:31,890 --> 00:33:43,320
functions as you see we found a

578
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:46,020
dangerous function this function passed

579
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:49,379
the receive the data from the port and

580
00:33:46,020 --> 00:33:52,800
build a command to execute as the fix

581
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:58,020
issues it can be used to open telnet key

582
00:33:52,800 --> 00:34:01,889
services we added as the logic of the

583
00:33:58,020 --> 00:34:05,960
protocol in this port actually it is PKI

584
00:34:01,890 --> 00:34:09,389
system @rz certifications and alias

585
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:12,570
interruptions but we found multiple

586
00:34:09,389 --> 00:34:15,889
abilities such as a yes

587
00:34:12,570 --> 00:34:20,310
es que es key is hard-coded in binary

588
00:34:15,889 --> 00:34:23,250
and we get is a private key from the

589
00:34:20,310 --> 00:34:27,810
file system and the password of the

590
00:34:23,250 --> 00:34:30,270
private key we casted out so we can use

591
00:34:27,810 --> 00:34:31,589
it to generate public key so we can

592
00:34:30,270 --> 00:34:35,538
communicate with

593
00:34:31,589 --> 00:34:38,129
port we will use those problems

594
00:34:35,539 --> 00:34:42,119
successfully pirate past the PR

595
00:34:38,129 --> 00:34:45,538
certificate wellif occasions after Lewis

596
00:34:42,119 --> 00:34:50,789
engineering wage right the exploit code

597
00:34:45,539 --> 00:34:55,409
like this as expected we finally start

598
00:34:50,789 --> 00:34:58,699
up tariffs device on the tee box through

599
00:34:55,409 --> 00:35:03,150
this port by using this export

600
00:34:58,699 --> 00:35:06,719
however telnet T in this mode requires

601
00:35:03,150 --> 00:35:11,459
password verification so here comes the

602
00:35:06,719 --> 00:35:14,430
new problem what's the password is is we

603
00:35:11,459 --> 00:35:19,469
use we use the most powerful for piece

604
00:35:14,430 --> 00:35:23,549
of in media twenty atti graphic card to

605
00:35:19,469 --> 00:35:26,430
crack the password a bit later we get

606
00:35:23,549 --> 00:35:29,939
the password the password Israeli

607
00:35:26,430 --> 00:35:33,439
complex including big and little case

608
00:35:29,939 --> 00:35:37,499
the chest numbers and the special chest

609
00:35:33,439 --> 00:35:37,828
now we have a load share of people tea

610
00:35:37,499 --> 00:35:40,259
box

611
00:35:37,829 --> 00:35:45,900
how can we control the classroom

612
00:35:40,259 --> 00:35:48,319
solution let's learn how remote country

613
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:52,589
how remote control of Wanko is

614
00:35:48,319 --> 00:35:56,429
implemented first the red dotted line in

615
00:35:52,589 --> 00:36:00,349
this figure represent the 4G module it

616
00:35:56,429 --> 00:36:03,689
has a long connection with cloud server

617
00:36:00,349 --> 00:36:06,900
when the open door instruction is issued

618
00:36:03,689 --> 00:36:11,299
from a PP the 40 module received as

619
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:14,459
instruction a process in mp you

620
00:36:11,299 --> 00:36:17,969
communicate with MCU through the series

621
00:36:14,459 --> 00:36:20,879
part another process in MC you receive

622
00:36:17,969 --> 00:36:23,849
the instruction and pass it and disp

623
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:27,539
each the command to come bus to open the

624
00:36:23,849 --> 00:36:32,039
door I think this could be the easiest

625
00:36:27,539 --> 00:36:37,529
way to control the car we can write a

626
00:36:32,039 --> 00:36:41,549
program to record the data that MP you

627
00:36:37,529 --> 00:36:44,190
right to em see you when the instruction

628
00:36:41,549 --> 00:36:50,190
is issued from the mobile phone

629
00:36:44,190 --> 00:36:53,160
and and then and and we went to her when

630
00:36:50,190 --> 00:36:58,829
and when we went to her another car the

631
00:36:53,160 --> 00:37:02,220
step is to use our exploit to open to

632
00:36:58,829 --> 00:37:06,599
attack let let that port so we get a

633
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:08,339
telnet shell and get the shell and then

634
00:37:06,599 --> 00:37:12,349
we excuse the problem

635
00:37:08,339 --> 00:37:14,880
to replay the data we recorded before

636
00:37:12,349 --> 00:37:20,010
that all will be well

637
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:22,619
open so the most important question is

638
00:37:20,010 --> 00:37:26,039
how to run our attack code or how to

639
00:37:22,619 --> 00:37:28,440
access that port do you remember the

640
00:37:26,039 --> 00:37:32,000
attack message that suprem mentioned

641
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:37,650
before through a fake base station or

642
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:40,670
operator internet or Wi-Fi hotspot you

643
00:37:37,650 --> 00:37:44,339
can access the port and run the exploit

644
00:37:40,670 --> 00:37:47,960
without touching the car if the car

645
00:37:44,339 --> 00:37:51,569
manufactures use use the private APN

646
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:56,940
network without isolation everything we

647
00:37:51,569 --> 00:37:59,759
become simple or terrible in the picture

648
00:37:56,940 --> 00:38:00,270
in the right picture we include the

649
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:04,230
private

650
00:38:00,270 --> 00:38:10,079
appian network of the tea box we scanned

651
00:38:04,230 --> 00:38:13,609
support - for xxx and find that there

652
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:18,270
are many devices were open this port so

653
00:38:13,609 --> 00:38:21,808
so we can attack many devices at the

654
00:38:18,270 --> 00:38:25,020
same time maybe we can use this range

655
00:38:21,809 --> 00:38:28,079
the attack measure to peer that damn

656
00:38:25,020 --> 00:38:34,619
because team just like the things in

657
00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:39,170
fast approaching 8 next let's talk about

658
00:38:34,619 --> 00:38:43,140
the mobility in fo da fok is a way to

659
00:38:39,170 --> 00:38:46,529
upgrade a firmware we found some 40

660
00:38:43,140 --> 00:38:49,379
modules a frequently check whether the

661
00:38:46,529 --> 00:38:52,289
crest graduation is the latest some

662
00:38:49,380 --> 00:38:56,339
devices check update when they start up

663
00:38:52,289 --> 00:38:57,600
and some are every 40 minutes in this

664
00:38:56,339 --> 00:39:00,180
case

665
00:38:57,600 --> 00:39:03,960
to reverse engineering we found that he

666
00:39:00,180 --> 00:39:07,080
logged into a FTP server to check for

667
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:10,800
new thermal ovations because the FTP

668
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:14,130
username and password is hard-coded we

669
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:16,440
can get it so we can log into the FTP

670
00:39:14,130 --> 00:39:20,340
server successfully used at user name

671
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:25,200
and password after logging we found many

672
00:39:20,340 --> 00:39:29,790
visions of that 40 devices the firmware

673
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:34,319
of all devices but this is not crazy

674
00:39:29,790 --> 00:39:39,060
soon we find that this FTP account has

675
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:42,570
right Bob privilege and another good

676
00:39:39,060 --> 00:39:48,620
news the 40 module did not verify the

677
00:39:42,570 --> 00:39:52,770
firm or fire in the FTP so we can upload

678
00:39:48,620 --> 00:39:56,819
firmware with back back door to the FTP

679
00:39:52,770 --> 00:39:58,860
server and the 40 models everywhere

680
00:39:56,820 --> 00:40:02,090
40 modules will download the new

681
00:39:58,860 --> 00:40:06,690
firmware automatically an upgrade to it

682
00:40:02,090 --> 00:40:10,500
so this means we can hack all 40 modules

683
00:40:06,690 --> 00:40:11,030
of this manufacturer in just in just one

684
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:16,170
day

685
00:40:11,030 --> 00:40:20,820
that's terrible we have just talked

686
00:40:16,170 --> 00:40:23,640
about some problems on fot a server side

687
00:40:20,820 --> 00:40:26,910
let's look let's look at the way

688
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:30,240
nobility of FOTA challenge site we found

689
00:40:26,910 --> 00:40:31,609
that some 40 module leads into support

690
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:36,089
forum after

691
00:40:31,610 --> 00:40:41,880
fota for example in this case we find

692
00:40:36,090 --> 00:40:44,940
the 40 module listen to 3 5 4 X access

693
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:48,570
port and easy to receive the upgrade

694
00:40:44,940 --> 00:40:52,530
command this port was originally used

695
00:40:48,570 --> 00:40:57,150
for inter-process communication but it

696
00:40:52,530 --> 00:41:01,050
was incorrectly banded to public not

697
00:40:57,150 --> 00:41:05,610
localhost so we can send the data to the

698
00:41:01,050 --> 00:41:08,690
port remotely after correct data

699
00:41:05,610 --> 00:41:11,040
exchanges per protocol of this port and

700
00:41:08,690 --> 00:41:14,010
and the reverse engineering

701
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:18,090
structure of the upgrade firm or fire as

702
00:41:14,010 --> 00:41:21,930
you can see destruction while complex it

703
00:41:18,090 --> 00:41:25,080
caused us a long time now but we finally

704
00:41:21,930 --> 00:41:27,629
workout it now we can make a new

705
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:33,020
firmware with backdoor and foster 4G

706
00:41:27,630 --> 00:41:36,330
modules to update it so we hacked it and

707
00:41:33,020 --> 00:41:40,020
almost every photo module has his own 80

708
00:41:36,330 --> 00:41:43,230
command passing process and some

709
00:41:40,020 --> 00:41:46,890
manufacturers implement some custom

710
00:41:43,230 --> 00:41:49,950
capabilities for example only the

711
00:41:46,890 --> 00:41:55,470
factory engineers know some Hyden 80

712
00:41:49,950 --> 00:41:58,020
command if we can find them out maybe we

713
00:41:55,470 --> 00:42:00,509
can open the adb slice through the

714
00:41:58,020 --> 00:42:04,590
hiding instructions we mentioned it

715
00:42:00,510 --> 00:42:07,110
before in other case 80 command

716
00:42:04,590 --> 00:42:10,320
injection vulnerability is also a lot

717
00:42:07,110 --> 00:42:14,280
for example the following picture is an

718
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:18,210
introduction for adding load in

719
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:22,020
development document where analysis the

720
00:42:18,210 --> 00:42:26,430
system command called here deeply we

721
00:42:22,020 --> 00:42:29,190
find there's a laser commanded injection

722
00:42:26,430 --> 00:42:32,370
one abilities in this emerging on the

723
00:42:29,190 --> 00:42:35,040
right we append our string to the 80

724
00:42:32,370 --> 00:42:38,279
command as you could see the return

725
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:41,820
contents showed our as command execute

726
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:44,010
it success through the 80 command that

727
00:42:41,820 --> 00:42:48,330
proves laser command injection

728
00:42:44,010 --> 00:42:51,450
availability in 80 command passing in

729
00:42:48,330 --> 00:42:54,810
general the 80 command can be only

730
00:42:51,450 --> 00:42:58,140
executed on USB which like sierra's port

731
00:42:54,810 --> 00:43:01,590
but some 40 modules support use of SMS

732
00:42:58,140 --> 00:43:06,120
to execute 80 commend it's usually used

733
00:43:01,590 --> 00:43:09,210
for remote control if we can find ie if

734
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:11,819
we can find an 80 command injection one

735
00:43:09,210 --> 00:43:14,910
ability in this scenario we can explore

736
00:43:11,820 --> 00:43:20,100
the part remotely by sending an attack

737
00:43:14,910 --> 00:43:23,190
message to it in fact we did fan such

738
00:43:20,100 --> 00:43:24,330
problem in some 40 modules this is a 4G

739
00:43:23,190 --> 00:43:28,770
module

740
00:43:24,330 --> 00:43:32,670
his support use SMS to execute a tea

741
00:43:28,770 --> 00:43:36,600
comment in this case we found it require

742
00:43:32,670 --> 00:43:39,630
a password in the content to verify if

743
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:44,100
the password is right it will execute it

744
00:43:39,630 --> 00:43:48,660
command in SMS but the way he verified

745
00:43:44,100 --> 00:43:51,720
is too weak still the old problem the

746
00:43:48,660 --> 00:43:54,230
password is hard-coded in binary once we

747
00:43:51,720 --> 00:44:01,439
get that device we can excrete it

748
00:43:54,230 --> 00:44:05,700
password in the of it so we can get it

749
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:08,520
get the password from the firmware as

750
00:44:05,700 --> 00:44:13,560
you see this is the support of the 80

751
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:16,259
command of this 4G module actually we

752
00:44:13,560 --> 00:44:19,830
find a command injection vulnerability

753
00:44:16,260 --> 00:44:24,660
in passing SMS 80 command this command

754
00:44:19,830 --> 00:44:27,360
is set FC as an finally we get Ally

755
00:44:24,660 --> 00:44:31,850
words the share by simply send a text

756
00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:34,590
message tweet we hacked it remotely

757
00:44:31,850 --> 00:44:38,490
there are many other successful case of

758
00:44:34,590 --> 00:44:41,370
attack because this text hope limit 50

759
00:44:38,490 --> 00:44:44,029
minutes I cannot talk about them to tell

760
00:44:41,370 --> 00:44:48,720
me one by one let me introduce them

761
00:44:44,030 --> 00:44:53,370
quickly such as we can use the Jama to

762
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:56,790
attack the 4G module for a job to 2g and

763
00:44:53,370 --> 00:44:59,910
use main in the middle and the browser

764
00:44:56,790 --> 00:45:02,880
when abilities Jared a or and a to

765
00:44:59,910 --> 00:45:06,330
interest in the ivory I of the car and

766
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:10,710
the debug process on the 4G mod is also

767
00:45:06,330 --> 00:45:13,290
a attack surface the dosage the dosage

768
00:45:10,710 --> 00:45:16,350
to test may cause the car loose

769
00:45:13,290 --> 00:45:19,680
connection of with the connection with

770
00:45:16,350 --> 00:45:24,000
the cloud server for a long time and the

771
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:26,430
and the way ipv6 even if the 4G modem

772
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:29,610
has been open enable that edge cables

773
00:45:26,430 --> 00:45:34,129
for war we can still access some

774
00:45:29,610 --> 00:45:37,509
dangerous sport why because the ipv6

775
00:45:34,130 --> 00:45:41,589
tables are not enabled we can simply

776
00:45:37,509 --> 00:45:47,199
past the firewall by using ipv6 address

777
00:45:41,589 --> 00:45:53,199
and almost every 4g Wi-Fi use 8 digital

778
00:45:47,199 --> 00:45:56,380
password there are numbers or numbers is

779
00:45:53,199 --> 00:46:01,059
its weak password and you can use the

780
00:45:56,380 --> 00:46:06,249
O's to get the handshake package learn

781
00:46:01,059 --> 00:46:08,739
craft it with many graphic card you can

782
00:46:06,249 --> 00:46:11,169
crack the password what you know few

783
00:46:08,739 --> 00:46:14,709
minutes and after cracked the password

784
00:46:11,169 --> 00:46:20,078
you are in the same Internet as a 4G

785
00:46:14,709 --> 00:46:22,928
modem you can launch further attacks in

786
00:46:20,079 --> 00:46:25,989
the next chapter let's talk about

787
00:46:22,929 --> 00:46:34,239
suggestion for defending against those

788
00:46:25,989 --> 00:46:36,459
attacks we have talked about a lot of

789
00:46:34,239 --> 00:46:39,219
attack massive and well abilities a

790
00:46:36,459 --> 00:46:42,908
detail before and it seems there are

791
00:46:39,219 --> 00:46:47,619
many problems so how should we our loss

792
00:46:42,909 --> 00:46:50,499
problems after communicated with many 4G

793
00:46:47,619 --> 00:46:53,589
module manufactures and hardwar

794
00:46:50,499 --> 00:46:56,499
manufactures and harmony factors we

795
00:46:53,589 --> 00:47:00,339
found that they did not realized later

796
00:46:56,499 --> 00:47:04,058
completely operating system in the 4G

797
00:47:00,339 --> 00:47:08,019
modem sometimes there may be many

798
00:47:04,059 --> 00:47:11,349
systems on the motherboard such as the

799
00:47:08,019 --> 00:47:16,359
tea box there could be a 3 or 4 system

800
00:47:11,349 --> 00:47:19,389
on the motherboard so faster or 4 we

801
00:47:16,359 --> 00:47:23,499
think we must identify those systems and

802
00:47:19,389 --> 00:47:24,809
the IPS next we should check the

803
00:47:23,499 --> 00:47:28,029
listening port

804
00:47:24,809 --> 00:47:31,869
especially those ports that can access

805
00:47:28,029 --> 00:47:34,689
remotely we have found that many many

806
00:47:31,869 --> 00:47:37,719
highly availability in most of the

807
00:47:34,689 --> 00:47:42,549
listening port process if absolutely

808
00:47:37,719 --> 00:47:47,739
necessary if not absolutely necessary do

809
00:47:42,549 --> 00:47:51,330
not listening port and be aware of the

810
00:47:47,739 --> 00:47:54,510
network access access by using the 4G

811
00:47:51,330 --> 00:47:57,690
face many people think that for the

812
00:47:54,510 --> 00:48:00,030
channel is seeker but actually hacker

813
00:47:57,690 --> 00:48:02,610
can play main in the middle is raised

814
00:48:00,030 --> 00:48:06,120
through fake base station another

815
00:48:02,610 --> 00:48:10,320
problem is that we find that a 19-5 of

816
00:48:06,120 --> 00:48:14,190
iptables Lewis active Lewis in the 40

817
00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:18,450
modules are empty that means the IP

818
00:48:14,190 --> 00:48:21,330
tables in the 40 model is empty it's

819
00:48:18,450 --> 00:48:24,899
dangerous so I think the simplest way to

820
00:48:21,330 --> 00:48:27,270
defend difference those attacks is the

821
00:48:24,900 --> 00:48:30,960
development at the developers you learn

822
00:48:27,270 --> 00:48:35,690
how children how to use a firewall well

823
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:38,280
that can solve 90% of the security

824
00:48:35,690 --> 00:48:42,990
problem

825
00:48:38,280 --> 00:48:49,500
so this is our talk thanks to our team

826
00:48:42,990 --> 00:48:51,629
member you know this is a teamwork this

827
00:48:49,500 --> 00:48:55,290
is our talk about security research of

828
00:48:51,630 --> 00:48:57,990
