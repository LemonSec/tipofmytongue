phones on vibrate it makes it easier for

14
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:41,040
the rest of us to ignore the ringing

15
00:00:39,329 --> 00:00:43,350
while you wait for your voicemail to

16
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:53,820
pick up and with that let us welcome our

17
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:54,449
speaker thank you very much for having

18
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:56,610
me here

19
00:00:54,449 --> 00:00:58,410
I'm super excited it's my first time

20
00:00:56,610 --> 00:01:00,750
here in blackhat then is a speaker as

21
00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:02,879
well and today we're going to talk about

22
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:05,430
selling zero days to government and

23
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:07,798
offensive security companies a little

24
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:09,780
bit about myself I working as a

25
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:12,150
vulnerability broker in the past four

26
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:15,240
years started my way at beyond security

27
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:17,549
SSD project a great company highly

28
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:19,710
recommended to work with and after a

29
00:01:17,549 --> 00:01:23,100
year and a half I opened my own company

30
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:24,509
this focus slowly on government and

31
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:27,780
offensive security companies called

32
00:01:24,509 --> 00:01:29,700
Kuryakin and I also work today in the

33
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:32,009
insurance industry as a security

34
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:35,790
researcher in one of the largest

35
00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:38,130
insurance company in Japan what we're

36
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:40,079
going to talk about today so we're going

37
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:42,750
to talk about we will start with who is

38
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:45,329
the who is this talk for a little bit

39
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:48,360
about my story who is selling zero-days

40
00:01:45,329 --> 00:01:50,158
what is the process of selling them how

41
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:54,180
to sell it and of course tips for

42
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:56,909
beginners this talk is not a technical

43
00:01:54,180 --> 00:02:00,240
talk and not the deep deep dive into the

44
00:01:56,909 --> 00:02:02,250
zero day market industry this talk is

45
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:04,199
meant to give you guidelines for

46
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:06,260
researchers that want to step into the

47
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:08,150
market they take part of it

48
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:10,009
and of course I'm going to share my

49
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:13,310
experience and deepen tricks that I use

50
00:02:10,009 --> 00:02:16,730
gather along the along the way so my

51
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:19,820
story as I already mentioned I founded

52
00:02:16,730 --> 00:02:21,769
my own company called Curie con started

53
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:24,739
small and started to get more and more

54
00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:28,520
attention had some quite effective

55
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:31,430
successful deals helping researchers to

56
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:34,330
find jobs or selling their products and

57
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:37,730
also started to work with the major

58
00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:41,120
clients in the industry after a few

59
00:02:37,730 --> 00:02:43,820
successful moves I've been approached

60
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:46,430
with one of the biggest players in my

61
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:49,459
industry and basically I got threatened

62
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:51,620
to stop what I'm doing because this is

63
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:53,960
not my main source of income I decided

64
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:57,860
it doesn't worth the risk and closed the

65
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:59,630
company but it's not the end we'll start

66
00:02:57,860 --> 00:03:02,630
with an overview about the tsardom

67
00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:05,329
market in traditional software companies

68
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:08,660
there is a there is a technological

69
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:10,550
problem but if you invest enough time

70
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:12,320
and money eventually you'll have a

71
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:14,000
product it doesn't matter if it will be

72
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:17,120
the best product but you will have a

73
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:19,489
product but but vulnerabilities behave a

74
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:22,850
little bit different it's sort of an art

75
00:03:19,489 --> 00:03:24,140
other than something that you just can

76
00:03:22,850 --> 00:03:27,530
put money on and you will get the

77
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:30,230
results so from vendor perspective they

78
00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:32,930
can put a lot of money into it but they

79
00:03:30,230 --> 00:03:35,119
will not find the core vulnerabilities

80
00:03:32,930 --> 00:03:37,970
in their product so it behaves a little

81
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:40,670
bit different a little bit about the

82
00:03:37,970 --> 00:03:44,060
history here in the past five years the

83
00:03:40,670 --> 00:03:45,530
serda industry changed drastically if we

84
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:48,620
are talking about increased number of

85
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:51,560
players a brokerage company conferences

86
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:54,380
bug bounties budgets are basically

87
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:56,450
unlimited another really interesting

88
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:59,150
thing that happened in the past five

89
00:03:56,450 --> 00:04:01,970
years is the fact that I call that

90
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:03,860
stepping out of the shadows in in the

91
00:04:01,970 --> 00:04:05,750
five years ago if you want to sell

92
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:07,250
something it was something that you

93
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:09,019
talked about in the dark alley or

94
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:11,600
something like that that no one knows of

95
00:04:09,019 --> 00:04:13,580
but today we see more and more companies

96
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:15,180
and players that actually publish it

97
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:17,250
that they are

98
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:20,190
are looking to buy vulnerabilities and

99
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:22,380
exploits on the free market so there is

100
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:24,900
starting working with invoices and

101
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:28,830
companies and contracts that things that

102
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:30,570
we didn't see five years ago but okay

103
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:33,359
who is interested in this you're the

104
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:35,219
industry there are different players in

105
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:37,590
the community and they're all interested

106
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:40,250
in zero-days but they're in the target

107
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:42,960
in the end is a little bit different I

108
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:45,780
kind of conservative here and I put

109
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:48,448
three different groups that we all

110
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:50,849
familiar with we have the white hat the

111
00:04:48,449 --> 00:04:53,699
gray hats and the black hats again it's

112
00:04:50,849 --> 00:04:56,909
more historical than other represent the

113
00:04:53,699 --> 00:04:59,160
nature of the zero day today but let's

114
00:04:56,910 --> 00:05:01,919
start with that so who is buying what

115
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:03,020
because each come each community has

116
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:04,830
different needs and different

117
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:07,530
perspective about this year the industry

118
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:09,210
will start with the white hat because

119
00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:13,020
it's the easiest and we need to talk

120
00:05:09,210 --> 00:05:16,169
about them a little bit the lucky one

121
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:19,650
reporting from 2018 shows they're more

122
00:05:16,169 --> 00:05:22,710
than 166 thousand registered hackers and

123
00:05:19,650 --> 00:05:24,929
they submitted more than 72,000

124
00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:27,810
vulnerabilities as you can see the

125
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:29,970
majorities and web vulnerabilities

126
00:05:27,810 --> 00:05:32,430
meaning XSS CSRF

127
00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:35,370
I call them low-hanging fruits easy to

128
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:39,690
find and quick money and we can see that

129
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:41,639
it's not only in 2018 in 2019 is the

130
00:05:39,690 --> 00:05:44,039
same thing we have more hackers out

131
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:47,849
there but the results are the same

132
00:05:44,039 --> 00:05:50,550
more than 73% are focused on web

133
00:05:47,849 --> 00:05:53,969
security low-hanging fruits easy to find

134
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:57,539
easy money it's not just the hacker one

135
00:05:53,970 --> 00:06:01,500
we also see that in background also 2018

136
00:05:57,539 --> 00:06:05,099
the higher pay was for XSS and in 2010

137
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:07,440
the same thing so what does it tell us

138
00:06:05,099 --> 00:06:09,570
about the white hat community that it's

139
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:11,370
a huge community that there is a lot of

140
00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:13,590
vulnerability submitted to the different

141
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:15,990
bug bounty programs but in the end the

142
00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:16,909
majority of web related and not they are

143
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:19,610
the core

144
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:21,680
high-end products but there are also

145
00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:23,560
high-end the researchers that contribute

146
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:27,620
to the security of different vendors

147
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:29,750
they're either a geology motivated or PR

148
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:32,810
motivated and we can see them in the

149
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:35,960
acknowledgement of every major company

150
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:38,450
that publishes like new versions here's

151
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:42,500
those just some of them that just pick

152
00:06:38,450 --> 00:06:44,090
up randomly but there's a lot of them if

153
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:46,010
I'll try to summarize the white hats

154
00:06:44,090 --> 00:06:48,169
because we need as I said we need to

155
00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:50,360
talk about them so there's a lot of

156
00:06:48,170 --> 00:06:53,630
vulnerability researchers out there they

157
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:55,460
are looking for low-hanging fruit and

158
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:58,400
easy targets because it's quick and easy

159
00:06:55,460 --> 00:07:03,020
money and the high-end researchers are

160
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:05,719
focused like a motivated either by PR or

161
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:07,039
they want to make the ideology motivated

162
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:10,700
and we want to make the internet more

163
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:13,340
secured so we talked about the white

164
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:15,590
hats because we should talked about them

165
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:18,340
but the other two different groups are

166
00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:21,919
slightly different and they looking for

167
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:23,719
different things so what are they

168
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:27,020
interesting they're interested in the

169
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:29,870
high-end market again I this is how I

170
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:33,440
phrase it so we can see here that we

171
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:35,240
have traditional browsers and OS related

172
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:37,219
vulnerabilities but on the right side

173
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:38,750
you can see the fat unicorn and I love

174
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:40,760
this picture that's supposed to

175
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:43,010
represent different kind of

176
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:45,020
vulnerabilities something that is quite

177
00:07:43,010 --> 00:07:47,750
unique even in the zero day industry

178
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:50,840
we're talking about zero clicks we're

179
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:53,360
talking about RC - oh I am for example

180
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:55,969
what's up or telegram with signal or

181
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:58,580
whatever those are quite unique and each

182
00:07:55,970 --> 00:08:01,160
and we'll talk about it player looking

183
00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:03,740
for those vulnerabilities but again the

184
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:07,430
majority is focused or either the

185
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:10,640
browser's or the OS of course no user

186
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:14,570
interaction prio etc this is what the

187
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:16,250
zero the industry all about about from

188
00:08:14,570 --> 00:08:18,320
researcher perspective they need to

189
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:20,720
understand that the service map they can

190
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:23,419
offer is not just an imminent product

191
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:26,700
they can sell different things we will

192
00:08:23,419 --> 00:08:29,760
start with the unproductive

193
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:31,770
as a researcher you can sell a full

194
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:34,140
vector meaning a combination of

195
00:08:31,770 --> 00:08:36,750
different vulnerabilities that in the

196
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:38,640
end will allow you to get a persistency

197
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:40,919
about your target we're talking about

198
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:43,470
remote code execution local privilege

199
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:45,500
escalation and persistency but you can

200
00:08:43,470 --> 00:08:48,420
also sell each one of them individually

201
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:51,720
meaning it can sell the RC alone the LP

202
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:53,640
alone etc but much but most of the

203
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:56,430
researcher do not know that you can sell

204
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:59,280
you can also sell part in the chain Ming

205
00:08:56,430 --> 00:09:01,709
info leaks and the medication bypass

206
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:03,420
doors are really common in the industry

207
00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:06,690
and it can make two decent living out of

208
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:09,240
them but other than end product we also

209
00:09:06,690 --> 00:09:11,880
have services and I will touch them in

210
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:15,000
the following slides but to give you the

211
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:17,580
idea you can sell it at a dedicated

212
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,730
researcher meaning that a company or a

213
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:22,260
government will outsource the

214
00:09:19,730 --> 00:09:25,170
vulnerability research to other like

215
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:28,080
companies or individual to find things

216
00:09:25,170 --> 00:09:30,930
you can also provide workshops but

217
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:33,510
workshop here meaning that each really

218
00:09:30,930 --> 00:09:35,250
big conferences have workshops black get

219
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:38,010
included but there are also workshops

220
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:41,280
that are only specific to government and

221
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:44,160
security region security companies that

222
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:46,680
are specific domains and you know what

223
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:48,870
like for example if a company wants you

224
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:51,060
step into a new domain they will hire a

225
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:53,370
workshop that someone that you already

226
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:54,530
familiar with that to close the gap as

227
00:09:53,370 --> 00:09:57,090
soon as possible

228
00:09:54,530 --> 00:09:59,520
consulting is another way of services

229
00:09:57,090 --> 00:10:01,410
that the researchers can offer for

230
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:04,140
example validate other researches

231
00:10:01,410 --> 00:10:06,420
vulnerability or just like answering

232
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:07,830
questions for the research team from the

233
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:10,740
government or the offensive security

234
00:10:07,830 --> 00:10:12,300
company and of course support and I will

235
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:15,630
talk about it a little bit later because

236
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:17,370
it's really important bullet what is the

237
00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:19,740
difference between governments and

238
00:10:17,370 --> 00:10:21,510
companies I mentioned them quite a lot

239
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:22,320
but there are different groups inside

240
00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:25,230
those

241
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:27,149
is that desire those basic groups the

242
00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:28,620
first let's talk about the offensive

243
00:10:27,149 --> 00:10:30,980
security companies because they are the

244
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:33,720
easiest one to understand we have

245
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:35,970
security companies that are focused on

246
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:38,930
products meaning they're selling to

247
00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:41,160
governments organizations here the

248
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:43,649
company actually sell the entire

249
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:46,439
infrastructure they're not just selling

250
00:10:43,649 --> 00:10:49,709
the zero-day themselves meaning that

251
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:51,269
they sell their vulnerabilities the

252
00:10:49,709 --> 00:10:55,550
mellah where the infrastructure the

253
00:10:51,269 --> 00:10:55,550
proxy the intelligence the intelligence

254
00:10:56,329 --> 00:11:01,079
the intelligence infrastructure that

255
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:03,509
comes along with that and on the other

256
00:11:01,079 --> 00:11:06,149
hand we have knowledge based companies

257
00:11:03,509 --> 00:11:08,160
meaning they are selling 0 things that's

258
00:11:06,149 --> 00:11:08,910
what they're doing that's what they're

259
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:11,189
there for

260
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:13,139
on the government side we have two

261
00:11:11,190 --> 00:11:13,709
different government entities let's put

262
00:11:13,139 --> 00:11:15,930
it that way

263
00:11:13,709 --> 00:11:18,779
the incapable countries incapable

264
00:11:15,930 --> 00:11:20,579
countries incapable countries and I will

265
00:11:18,779 --> 00:11:23,120
take an made-up example I'll take

266
00:11:20,579 --> 00:11:25,229
Antarctica just not to offend anyone and

267
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:27,360
Antarctica want to acquire foreign

268
00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:29,670
abilities but they don't have an

269
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:31,680
internal research team meaning that if

270
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:34,260
they you will offer them even for free

271
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:36,839
and RC for one of the platforms are

272
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:38,610
interested they would not know what to

273
00:11:36,839 --> 00:11:40,380
do with that meaning they do not

274
00:11:38,610 --> 00:11:42,329
understand the value of it they don't

275
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:44,850
know how to chain it then they don't

276
00:11:42,329 --> 00:11:48,089
know how to write new exploits to older

277
00:11:44,850 --> 00:11:51,149
or newer versions so those are incapable

278
00:11:48,089 --> 00:11:53,670
countries most of them will abide the

279
00:11:51,149 --> 00:11:56,220
end products from the security companies

280
00:11:53,670 --> 00:11:58,019
on the other hand we have the capable

281
00:11:56,220 --> 00:12:00,690
countries with a strong internal

282
00:11:58,019 --> 00:12:03,449
research team they can actually value

283
00:12:00,690 --> 00:12:04,170
the item itself and they can do things

284
00:12:03,449 --> 00:12:05,760
with that

285
00:12:04,170 --> 00:12:07,889
for example chain it to other

286
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:11,310
vulnerabilities and create different

287
00:12:07,889 --> 00:12:14,399
vectors from researchers perspective you

288
00:12:11,310 --> 00:12:15,859
want to focus on those on all the

289
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:17,970
offensive security companies and

290
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:20,670
incompetent government that has a

291
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:22,230
internal research team because they will

292
00:12:20,670 --> 00:12:26,790
understand the value of it and willing

293
00:12:22,230 --> 00:12:29,759
to pay more so let's start how do you

294
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:31,680
get those 0 days right from the

295
00:12:29,759 --> 00:12:34,380
researchers there are different kind of

296
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:37,349
groups in the researchers we start with

297
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:39,630
the the biggest one called researchers

298
00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:41,310
and I already showed you there are more

299
00:12:39,630 --> 00:12:43,589
than hundreds of thousands of

300
00:12:41,310 --> 00:12:45,689
researchers around the world but they

301
00:12:43,589 --> 00:12:48,360
are not high-end researchers they not

302
00:12:45,690 --> 00:12:50,760
capable finding vulnerabilities in the

303
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:53,399
product that you I show you earlier so

304
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:55,380
if we go step one layer down we have the

305
00:12:53,399 --> 00:12:57,630
high-end researchers that I already

306
00:12:55,380 --> 00:13:01,500
mentioned that there are either ideology

307
00:12:57,630 --> 00:13:04,560
motivated or PR motivated and then we

308
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:05,760
have the work that high-end researchers

309
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:08,369
that work in the effective security

310
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:10,560
companies or governments and in the end

311
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:13,890
willing to sell meaning that there are

312
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:16,099
individuals or companies that finds or

313
00:13:13,890 --> 00:13:19,830
days and sell it in the open market

314
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:22,020
roughly around 400 people worldwide this

315
00:13:19,830 --> 00:13:26,000
estimate I have if you have any other

316
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:30,510
best figure out I will be glad to hear

317
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:33,660
this chart is based slowly solely or

318
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:37,080
based on my experience each researcher I

319
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:39,180
met quite a lot of researchers in the

320
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:41,700
past four years I can pinpoint where

321
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:45,329
they are in this chart how does it chart

322
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:46,380
works usually when you're in young age

323
00:13:45,330 --> 00:13:48,360
around 20

324
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:50,730
you don't really familiar with the sewer

325
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:53,520
the industry didn't view and you don't

326
00:13:50,730 --> 00:13:56,459
know that it your item worth money so

327
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:59,130
that's why you basically publish it for

328
00:13:56,459 --> 00:14:01,140
free online you report the vulnerability

329
00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:04,080
to the vendor and then you got to start

330
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:06,330
to get attention then you start you step

331
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:11,130
into the second step and the second

332
00:14:06,330 --> 00:14:13,260
column here that you've got you get you

333
00:14:11,130 --> 00:14:15,270
get offered to work in offensive

334
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:17,610
security industry companies or

335
00:14:15,270 --> 00:14:20,130
governments at that point you make a

336
00:14:17,610 --> 00:14:22,770
really decent salary but you understand

337
00:14:20,130 --> 00:14:25,800
that your boss making a lot more on your

338
00:14:22,770 --> 00:14:27,360
items so at that point you decide to

339
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:29,459
open your own company because you are

340
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:31,620
the researcher you know exactly what to

341
00:14:29,459 --> 00:14:34,199
do and you said okay I have the

342
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:36,570
technical capabilities to find

343
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:38,790
vulnerabilities but what those

344
00:14:36,570 --> 00:14:41,820
researchers don't know it's how to

345
00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:43,349
manage a company because the findings

346
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:44,640
earlier that zero day is it's only a

347
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:47,280
technical part but you

348
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:50,180
also need to have a company that means

349
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:53,670
that you need to work with the legal and

350
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:56,370
accountants and find clients and it's

351
00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:59,939
really hard work to do and usually you

352
00:14:56,370 --> 00:15:02,490
get paid only slowly on your items that

353
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:05,040
you sell so if you didn't find a

354
00:15:02,490 --> 00:15:07,740
vulnerability for four months in a row

355
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:09,870
you don't have any income and probably

356
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:12,210
you are in the age of 32 and you want to

357
00:15:09,870 --> 00:15:15,060
make your own family so at that point

358
00:15:12,210 --> 00:15:17,400
you start to get stressed that's why we

359
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:19,770
go to the end or - right hit the right

360
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:22,620
side of this slide we can see they

361
00:15:19,770 --> 00:15:25,350
started to take more and more projects

362
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:27,930
that are not vulnerability research for

363
00:15:25,350 --> 00:15:29,970
example pen tests or they you really

364
00:15:27,930 --> 00:15:32,370
want to study income so they go going to

365
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:35,580
work with one of the major vendors in

366
00:15:32,370 --> 00:15:38,010
the market so again this is solely on my

367
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:39,930
experience but I can input each one of

368
00:15:38,010 --> 00:15:43,050
the researches that I work with based

369
00:15:39,930 --> 00:15:47,550
upon that from the researchers

370
00:15:43,050 --> 00:15:48,780
perspective those are the two timeslots

371
00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:50,699
that you have to sell your

372
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:54,290
vulnerabilities and this lecture will

373
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:57,450
focus on them so what we learned so far

374
00:15:54,290 --> 00:15:59,640
what kind of products and governments

375
00:15:57,450 --> 00:16:01,370
are looking into what is the different

376
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:03,000
products and services that you can offer

377
00:16:01,370 --> 00:16:05,190
what is the difference between

378
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:07,560
governments and companies and of course

379
00:16:05,190 --> 00:16:11,250
the researchers hurricane courage

380
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:12,750
infinity sticks oh I hate that word okay

381
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:14,700
so what is the process

382
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:17,420
selling zero-days that's why we here

383
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:18,720
there the process is relatively

384
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:21,479
straightforward

385
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:24,900
we researcher find a vulnerability and

386
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:27,300
you want to market it so it contacts a

387
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:29,189
potential client it provides an overview

388
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:30,839
about the vulnerability and what the

389
00:16:29,190 --> 00:16:34,080
capability of the vulnerability is

390
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:38,120
there's the negotiation period there is

391
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:42,500
a contract QA and of course payment I

392
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:45,300
will start with those four bullets but

393
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:48,060
eventually each one of here the audience

394
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:51,000
I think is interesting in the payment so

395
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:54,630
payouts by default is a researcher you

396
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:56,070
are your expect to get paid more than

397
00:16:54,630 --> 00:16:58,590
more than the van

398
00:16:56,070 --> 00:17:00,750
bug bounty because if it's the same

399
00:16:58,590 --> 00:17:04,110
amount of money I think the majority

400
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:06,599
will go to the vendor and try to do from

401
00:17:04,109 --> 00:17:09,540
their perspective the right thing but

402
00:17:06,599 --> 00:17:13,589
from a researcher there is no single

403
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:15,839
price list there is no www-what how much

404
00:17:13,589 --> 00:17:19,669
my vulnerability worth com

405
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:22,500
so today researcher based there like

406
00:17:19,670 --> 00:17:25,800
pricing on those three bullets

407
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:27,990
first of all competitions if you can get

408
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:31,350
paid from point one eighty thousand

409
00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:34,830
dollars for an LP so this is your

410
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:37,320
benchmark are there another example as

411
00:17:34,830 --> 00:17:39,600
rumors when researchers sell they

412
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:42,389
usually talk about that and you have the

413
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:44,040
idea of how much things worth and of

414
00:17:42,390 --> 00:17:46,800
course we have hacking team like

415
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:49,159
incident that we actually saw how much

416
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:51,750
they paid for the specific vulnerability

417
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:54,630
the one company that changed the game

418
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:57,740
after the rules basically are zero diem

419
00:17:54,630 --> 00:18:00,720
because they just published the list

420
00:17:57,740 --> 00:18:03,540
around three years in a row this this

421
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:06,300
was the benchmark like researcher when

422
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:09,060
they try to sell vulnerability the first

423
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:11,700
thing they do went to this there this

424
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:13,950
iridium website and see how much they

425
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:16,740
are willing to pay for it but in reality

426
00:18:13,950 --> 00:18:18,570
things are much more complicated there

427
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:20,490
is the matrix for each vulnerability

428
00:18:18,570 --> 00:18:22,740
there are different parameters that we

429
00:18:20,490 --> 00:18:24,660
need to understand before we can provide

430
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:28,320
you an estimate of how much the

431
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:30,150
vulnerability is actually worth I will

432
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:32,220
go over them but there are two things

433
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:34,350
that you need to understand before the

434
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:35,790
first one is different entities will pay

435
00:18:34,350 --> 00:18:38,070
different sums for the same

436
00:18:35,790 --> 00:18:41,250
vulnerability and the second thing is

437
00:18:38,070 --> 00:18:45,750
warranty and the model the client works

438
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:48,390
is really matter but the majority of the

439
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:50,850
like how do you do pricing for

440
00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:54,270
vulnerability or for an item its supply

441
00:18:50,850 --> 00:18:56,550
and demand because if there is if you

442
00:18:54,270 --> 00:18:59,490
have a vulnerability for example for an

443
00:18:56,550 --> 00:19:01,770
iOS and all the clients are on the

444
00:18:59,490 --> 00:19:04,070
industry and already have a solution so

445
00:19:01,770 --> 00:19:06,790
mean that no one will buy it from you

446
00:19:04,070 --> 00:19:09,110
or the price will be lower than expected

447
00:19:06,790 --> 00:19:11,899
exclusive a non-exclusive is really

448
00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:14,780
important as well if you ask me six

449
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:17,090
months ago this price died just a second

450
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:18,740
it's the second site there is a price

451
00:19:17,090 --> 00:19:21,709
list that are going to show you and all

452
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:24,500
the prices were for only exclusive but

453
00:19:21,710 --> 00:19:26,360
today the majority of the pricing is

454
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:29,720
going to non exclusive and the price is

455
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:31,879
really high because as a researcher you

456
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:33,680
want to maximize the amount of money

457
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:37,370
that you can get for a single

458
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:39,980
vulnerability so I said warranty and

459
00:19:37,370 --> 00:19:42,320
sell model it's important why is that a

460
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:44,990
company can offer you one and a half

461
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:47,659
million dollar for vulnerability but in

462
00:19:44,990 --> 00:19:50,570
their terms it will be it will be

463
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:53,020
splitted over 12 months and they will

464
00:19:50,570 --> 00:19:55,580
give it to their customers on day one

465
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:58,250
meaning that I'm not sure a

466
00:19:55,580 --> 00:20:01,159
vulnerability will last one full year

467
00:19:58,250 --> 00:20:03,260
and you will get the full one point five

468
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:05,120
million dollar so it's really important

469
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:07,820
to understand the terms that you are

470
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:10,610
selling your item this is the priceless

471
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:15,139
that I talked about and what you can see

472
00:20:10,610 --> 00:20:17,689
here its prices for non exclusive items

473
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:20,570
in again six months ago I told you it

474
00:20:17,690 --> 00:20:22,370
was for exclusive vulnerability but in

475
00:20:20,570 --> 00:20:25,100
today reality we're talking about

476
00:20:22,370 --> 00:20:27,169
non-exclusive as you can see on the

477
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:30,139
dollar then like in the left side of

478
00:20:27,170 --> 00:20:32,300
this of the slide assuming that is 95

479
00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:34,940
percent reliability or something similar

480
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:37,370
to that and up to 5 second execution

481
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:39,620
time so we are talking about not just I

482
00:20:37,370 --> 00:20:41,479
found the crash and I think I can

483
00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:43,790
actually explain it we are talking about

484
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:46,430
exploits that are really easy to

485
00:20:43,790 --> 00:20:51,020
understand and are all ready to put in

486
00:20:46,430 --> 00:20:53,210
production as already mentioned just

487
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:55,160
because you have an item doesn't mean

488
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:57,470
there is an active buyer that's willing

489
00:20:55,160 --> 00:21:00,770
to buy it for you so it's really

490
00:20:57,470 --> 00:21:03,320
differentiate between times and again

491
00:21:00,770 --> 00:21:05,629
market demand changed regularly I show

492
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:07,520
you the like the big list of products

493
00:21:05,630 --> 00:21:09,350
that offensive security companies in

494
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:11,900
government are interested but it's

495
00:21:09,350 --> 00:21:14,279
changed from time to time for example

496
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:17,340
two years ago we saw

497
00:21:14,279 --> 00:21:18,809
that one of the one of the

498
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:23,478
vulnerabilities that we're trying to

499
00:21:18,809 --> 00:21:26,940
find oh I forgot the name sorry for that

500
00:21:23,479 --> 00:21:28,349
I'll get to it later but there is the

501
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:32,090
high-end vulnerability that I'll show

502
00:21:28,349 --> 00:21:35,099
you already there are in regular demand

503
00:21:32,090 --> 00:21:37,738
okay so let's talk about validation of

504
00:21:35,099 --> 00:21:42,210
the vulnerability by the client

505
00:21:37,739 --> 00:21:44,369
the following slides are more legal from

506
00:21:42,210 --> 00:21:46,830
that perspective but I'm not a lawyer so

507
00:21:44,369 --> 00:21:48,599
each one of the of you that want to step

508
00:21:46,830 --> 00:21:51,839
into this market I highly recommend you

509
00:21:48,599 --> 00:21:52,619
to find a lawyer so let's start we start

510
00:21:51,839 --> 00:21:55,349
with this back

511
00:21:52,619 --> 00:21:57,209
what is this back a researcher as a

512
00:21:55,349 --> 00:21:59,070
researcher you don't want to give the

513
00:21:57,210 --> 00:22:01,649
technical information about the

514
00:21:59,070 --> 00:22:03,330
vulnerability one once you try one you

515
00:22:01,649 --> 00:22:05,908
want to sell the vulnerability to a

516
00:22:03,330 --> 00:22:07,739
client therefore as a researcher you

517
00:22:05,909 --> 00:22:09,869
guarantee the end result of the

518
00:22:07,739 --> 00:22:12,899
vulnerability on a predefined

519
00:22:09,869 --> 00:22:16,259
configuration the client will Chile will

520
00:22:12,899 --> 00:22:20,789
test your item based upon that spec and

521
00:22:16,259 --> 00:22:23,339
if you are your item is not comply

522
00:22:20,789 --> 00:22:26,070
comply to the spec you sent they candy

523
00:22:23,339 --> 00:22:28,678
you can decline the offer itself again

524
00:22:26,070 --> 00:22:31,889
there is a margin here about 5% that you

525
00:22:28,679 --> 00:22:33,659
can make it like vulnerability said it's

526
00:22:31,889 --> 00:22:36,089
95 percent and in reality it's 90

527
00:22:33,659 --> 00:22:38,070
percent it's still okay but never

528
00:22:36,089 --> 00:22:40,279
claimed that it's more than what it

529
00:22:38,070 --> 00:22:40,279
should be

530
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:48,210
validation period usually 14 days either

531
00:22:44,509 --> 00:22:51,839
the client has the ability to test your

532
00:22:48,210 --> 00:22:53,879
item in this period the validation

533
00:22:51,839 --> 00:22:56,428
period the client can decline the offer

534
00:22:53,879 --> 00:22:59,070
if it doesn't comply with the spec you

535
00:22:56,429 --> 00:23:00,539
send them but there are three different

536
00:22:59,070 --> 00:23:03,779
things I want you to take from this

537
00:23:00,539 --> 00:23:05,429
slide the first one is make sure that

538
00:23:03,779 --> 00:23:08,909
you get access to the test environment

539
00:23:05,429 --> 00:23:12,229
to the client test environment because

540
00:23:08,909 --> 00:23:14,190
sometimes the client don't know as if

541
00:23:12,229 --> 00:23:16,859
don't know how to operate your

542
00:23:14,190 --> 00:23:19,190
vulnerability as you intend them to and

543
00:23:16,859 --> 00:23:22,280
therefore it can actually

544
00:23:19,190 --> 00:23:26,420
take a bed turn and close the deal and

545
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:29,120
when possible make sure you can supply a

546
00:23:26,420 --> 00:23:31,460
full environment for the test

547
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:35,389
environment for the client itself in a

548
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:38,030
VM or whatever thought for you and the

549
00:23:35,390 --> 00:23:40,070
third one it's just make sure when just

550
00:23:38,030 --> 00:23:42,110
before you send the item itself make

551
00:23:40,070 --> 00:23:45,230
sure the client is ready to receive the

552
00:23:42,110 --> 00:23:46,189
item itself and the test environment is

553
00:23:45,230 --> 00:23:49,490
already set up

554
00:23:46,190 --> 00:23:50,960
because again you you send your item and

555
00:23:49,490 --> 00:23:52,970
you don't know what will go with that

556
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:56,260
and you want to make sure everything

557
00:23:52,970 --> 00:24:00,290
goes smoothly as possible

558
00:23:56,260 --> 00:24:02,570
freeze and payments the first thing that

559
00:24:00,290 --> 00:24:04,700
I wanted like to make sure everyone in

560
00:24:02,570 --> 00:24:07,460
the audience understand that there is no

561
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:10,520
such a thing an advance payment there

562
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:13,190
are a lot of hustlers in the world that

563
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:15,830
will try to contact you and say I have

564
00:24:13,190 --> 00:24:18,710
this amazing vulnerability with the

565
00:24:15,830 --> 00:24:21,370
perfect spec and reasonable price but

566
00:24:18,710 --> 00:24:24,830
they will tell you that I only need

567
00:24:21,370 --> 00:24:26,959
$5,000 duty to buy a flight ticket from

568
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:28,909
one point to another just to make sure

569
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:32,690
that you're you show me that you're

570
00:24:28,910 --> 00:24:35,330
serious you will pay for it so no those

571
00:24:32,690 --> 00:24:38,240
are hustlers and we saw so many of them

572
00:24:35,330 --> 00:24:40,610
and they actually been published in

573
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:42,950
Twitter's several of them but again I'm

574
00:24:40,610 --> 00:24:45,979
not here to make show you the names but

575
00:24:42,950 --> 00:24:48,140
it's true so that's why you would you

576
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:50,530
would not get paid before the client

577
00:24:48,140 --> 00:24:53,720
actually tests the vulnerability

578
00:24:50,530 --> 00:24:56,810
payments there is the split split the

579
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:59,090
risk approach that the majority of

580
00:24:56,810 --> 00:25:01,639
clients work with meaning that you will

581
00:24:59,090 --> 00:25:04,370
get X percentage after the validation

582
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:07,310
period and then the rest split in chunks

583
00:25:04,370 --> 00:25:09,679
for three or six months usually three

584
00:25:07,310 --> 00:25:14,659
months and if it's a relatively small

585
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:18,650
transaction meaning up to $100,000 it's

586
00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:20,600
100% after validation of course as I

587
00:25:18,650 --> 00:25:20,990
said before we're stepping out of the

588
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:23,929
shadows

589
00:25:20,990 --> 00:25:26,540
meaning that VAT invoices is really

590
00:25:23,930 --> 00:25:28,610
important and because

591
00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:31,129
Evette cryptocurrency became more and

592
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:33,550
more difficult to handle because for a

593
00:25:31,130 --> 00:25:36,710
company to purchase that amount of

594
00:25:33,550 --> 00:25:39,800
Bitcoin for example cryptocurrency this

595
00:25:36,710 --> 00:25:42,410
is making it basically impossible to do

596
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:45,020
so so if you're if you're working with

597
00:25:42,410 --> 00:25:47,360
invoices you will get bank transfer and

598
00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:50,660
that's what we're aiming for and of

599
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:53,209
course just to note it here the majority

600
00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:54,860
of transactions are in u.s. dollars just

601
00:25:53,210 --> 00:25:59,770
make sure you have a US dollar account

602
00:25:54,860 --> 00:26:03,379
to actually receive the money okay next

603
00:25:59,770 --> 00:26:06,170
property rights when we are talking

604
00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:08,570
about property rights each deal has two

605
00:26:06,170 --> 00:26:11,600
different its binary or you sell it

606
00:26:08,570 --> 00:26:13,700
exclusively or non-exclusive when you're

607
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:15,919
talking about non-exclusive the

608
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:18,650
researcher sells and license to the

609
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:21,880
vulnerability and the license can be

610
00:26:18,650 --> 00:26:24,410
used or resell to other clients as well

611
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:26,960
it can be solved multiple times and no

612
00:26:24,410 --> 00:26:29,930
problem with that the problem is when we

613
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:33,830
go to exclusive because the buyer

614
00:26:29,930 --> 00:26:36,680
acquire everything all the IP all title

615
00:26:33,830 --> 00:26:39,429
all copyrights is owned by the clients

616
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:42,530
itself meaning that if you want to

617
00:26:39,430 --> 00:26:45,080
actually use your own vulnerability to

618
00:26:42,530 --> 00:26:47,300
find other vulnerabilities in iOS is a

619
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:49,730
really great example for that so you're

620
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:53,000
not allowed to so just make sure that

621
00:26:49,730 --> 00:26:55,910
you as a researcher when you try to make

622
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:57,500
a contract you put that as one of the

623
00:26:55,910 --> 00:27:00,620
things that you can actually allow to do

624
00:26:57,500 --> 00:27:03,140
use the vulnerability for yourself in a

625
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:08,600
private matter in order in order to find

626
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:09,860
other items next support I told you that

627
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:14,389
I'm going to talk about that a little

628
00:27:09,860 --> 00:27:16,820
bit and support can take many forms it

629
00:27:14,390 --> 00:27:19,790
can be exploited justments two other new

630
00:27:16,820 --> 00:27:22,280
newer versions and if the vulnerability

631
00:27:19,790 --> 00:27:24,889
is patch you as the researcher have to

632
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:27,410
like provide a new vulnerability and

633
00:27:24,890 --> 00:27:30,800
also can you can provide a workshop on

634
00:27:27,410 --> 00:27:33,050
the vulnerability to the client itself

635
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:35,850
but what you need to understand that

636
00:27:33,050 --> 00:27:37,668
that support worth a lot of money

637
00:27:35,850 --> 00:27:41,879
you don't just give it away for free

638
00:27:37,669 --> 00:27:44,220
meaning that if you are giving sort kind

639
00:27:41,879 --> 00:27:47,059
of kind of sort of support make sure you

640
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:47,059
get paid for it

641
00:27:47,090 --> 00:27:53,699
governing the law governing law it's

642
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:58,440
basically if everything turned horribly

643
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:59,460
wrong where you can sue because again

644
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:01,679
not a client

645
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:04,649
neither the researcher want to go there

646
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:06,690
but sometimes we need to understand what

647
00:28:04,649 --> 00:28:10,219
are the law the laws that you are

648
00:28:06,690 --> 00:28:14,090
applicable to for example if you are

649
00:28:10,220 --> 00:28:18,090
French researcher and you sold it to

650
00:28:14,090 --> 00:28:20,879
us-based company in which law are you

651
00:28:18,090 --> 00:28:22,978
under the US law or the French law it's

652
00:28:20,879 --> 00:28:25,498
really important to make to make sure

653
00:28:22,979 --> 00:28:30,479
that you the researcher define exactly

654
00:28:25,499 --> 00:28:32,879
where the law are governing exports the

655
00:28:30,479 --> 00:28:35,759
ability and here you come the funny part

656
00:28:32,879 --> 00:28:38,908
was another agreement I'm sure that the

657
00:28:35,759 --> 00:28:43,259
your majority that sits here no that was

658
00:28:38,909 --> 00:28:46,559
an agreement is for dual-use items for

659
00:28:43,259 --> 00:28:49,229
example you can buy rather to find for

660
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:52,259
civilian uses and put it in an airport

661
00:28:49,229 --> 00:28:55,259
or you can buy it and use it as a merit

662
00:28:52,259 --> 00:28:58,349
military use so those things are for

663
00:28:55,259 --> 00:29:01,019
dual use what's so special about that in

664
00:28:58,349 --> 00:29:02,549
the past few years the under was on our

665
00:29:01,019 --> 00:29:06,720
agreement vulnerabilities and exploits

666
00:29:02,549 --> 00:29:09,479
are it has been added but what you need

667
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:11,519
to understand that each each government

668
00:29:09,479 --> 00:29:14,669
or each country has a slightly different

669
00:29:11,519 --> 00:29:16,649
laws regarding the vasana agreement

670
00:29:14,669 --> 00:29:20,369
because what's on our agreement

671
00:29:16,649 --> 00:29:22,559
it's an agreement it's not equal law so

672
00:29:20,369 --> 00:29:25,139
each each government that signed the

673
00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:28,019
contract actually obligated to form

674
00:29:25,139 --> 00:29:30,709
rules based on the under on the

675
00:29:28,019 --> 00:29:33,899
agreement itself in their own country so

676
00:29:30,710 --> 00:29:37,019
each country has the freedom to do

677
00:29:33,899 --> 00:29:38,939
slightly like to regulate different

678
00:29:37,019 --> 00:29:41,779
rules so it's really important to

679
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:44,340
understand the rules in your country

680
00:29:41,779 --> 00:29:45,770
this is like from the rotten agreement

681
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:50,520
is just

682
00:29:45,770 --> 00:29:52,950
it said it's just a copy paste so it's

683
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:55,470
not that important but what if I'll try

684
00:29:52,950 --> 00:29:58,230
to show it to you in a really easy way

685
00:29:55,470 --> 00:30:01,260
there are there was an argument distinct

686
00:29:58,230 --> 00:30:04,530
two vectors the first one is that you

687
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:06,900
are a researcher and you want to to

688
00:30:04,530 --> 00:30:08,940
report it to the vendor and that point

689
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:12,240
you're good to go you don't need any

690
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:14,490
licenses and you don't break any law but

691
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:17,310
if you try to sell the vulnerability or

692
00:30:14,490 --> 00:30:20,070
exploit to a third party that it's not

693
00:30:17,310 --> 00:30:23,970
directly the vendor here you need to

694
00:30:20,070 --> 00:30:26,669
have your licenses ready and usually the

695
00:30:23,970 --> 00:30:29,250
one that the organization that hand

696
00:30:26,670 --> 00:30:31,920
those licenses are the Minister of

697
00:30:29,250 --> 00:30:33,840
Defense in the majority of countries so

698
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:36,780
you need the license for marketing and

699
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:40,320
you also need licenses for the sale

700
00:30:36,780 --> 00:30:43,879
itself and it's really long process so

701
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:46,740
please start it as soon as possible

702
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:49,650
finding the customers sounds easier

703
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:52,620
right I have a vulnerability I know that

704
00:30:49,650 --> 00:30:54,780
everyone wants it how do I contact the

705
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:56,879
different clients so there are three

706
00:30:54,780 --> 00:30:58,950
different ways that I thought of you

707
00:30:56,880 --> 00:31:01,200
have the official way you have the

708
00:30:58,950 --> 00:31:03,360
personal connection and of course you

709
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:05,520
have the vulnerability brokers that I'm

710
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:07,439
one of them let's start with the

711
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:10,620
official point of contact some

712
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:14,100
governments and of offensive security

713
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:16,770
companies they have this official point

714
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:18,689
of contact it can be here in conferences

715
00:31:16,770 --> 00:31:21,930
that you will be approached by one of

716
00:31:18,690 --> 00:31:25,470
them it can be by business cards cold

717
00:31:21,930 --> 00:31:27,450
email etc and again as a researcher if

718
00:31:25,470 --> 00:31:30,120
you think a company is interested in

719
00:31:27,450 --> 00:31:33,210
zero days you can just ask them and they

720
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:34,290
probably will reply you if we're talking

721
00:31:33,210 --> 00:31:36,330
about government

722
00:31:34,290 --> 00:31:38,399
it's like slightly different the

723
00:31:36,330 --> 00:31:41,000
majority of governments would not like

724
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:43,620
to work with you directly they have a

725
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:45,420
person that they already work with it

726
00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:49,469
can be a broker to be a company and

727
00:31:45,420 --> 00:31:51,360
usually he do the entire process so some

728
00:31:49,470 --> 00:31:53,940
of them are not that

729
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:56,070
we'll be openly work with you but some

730
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:58,680
of them are but what you need to

731
00:31:56,070 --> 00:32:01,470
understand that the it's really

732
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:04,200
time-consuming and don't expect amazing

733
00:32:01,470 --> 00:32:07,080
terms because there are big organization

734
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:09,600
and it takes a lot of time to actually

735
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:11,820
make a deal because they need to approve

736
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:16,100
the the contract they approve the budget

737
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:20,100
and this thing takes quite a lot of time

738
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:23,310
if we're talking about the pros and cons

739
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:25,860
here about official point of contact so

740
00:32:23,310 --> 00:32:28,350
you know exactly what you're selling to

741
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:31,409
it's really easy to understand but

742
00:32:28,350 --> 00:32:33,540
there's a lot of cons related to that it

743
00:32:31,410 --> 00:32:35,790
depends where the company is based the

744
00:32:33,540 --> 00:32:37,950
like the legal part is really important

745
00:32:35,790 --> 00:32:41,300
because the last thing you want to do is

746
00:32:37,950 --> 00:32:45,210
actually get involved in illegal

747
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:47,879
transaction if we're talking about a

748
00:32:45,210 --> 00:32:51,210
personal connection it's basically the

749
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:53,610
same thing but you can say that you'll

750
00:32:51,210 --> 00:32:55,470
get fully paid because you know the

751
00:32:53,610 --> 00:32:58,050
person then they know you and you have a

752
00:32:55,470 --> 00:32:59,940
trust relationship between you so it's

753
00:32:58,050 --> 00:33:02,460
really important but again it's more of

754
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:04,590
the same if we are talking about

755
00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:06,810
vulnerability brokers and again I'm one

756
00:33:04,590 --> 00:33:09,300
of them there are different services map

757
00:33:06,810 --> 00:33:12,929
that we offer it's not the full service

758
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:15,419
map but yeah this is me there but again

759
00:33:12,930 --> 00:33:18,240
I will focus on selling and end products

760
00:33:15,420 --> 00:33:20,550
because this is talk is all about so

761
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:24,210
from there's a lot of benefits to work

762
00:33:20,550 --> 00:33:27,030
with brokers right because as a

763
00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:29,490
researcher you can stay an enemy there

764
00:33:27,030 --> 00:33:31,649
we understand the market landscape we

765
00:33:29,490 --> 00:33:34,440
understand the pricing and how the

766
00:33:31,650 --> 00:33:36,360
process works we have a closing an

767
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:38,940
intimate relationship with our clients

768
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:42,090
meaning that they will approach us and

769
00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:44,970
ask us do you have item a B and C and

770
00:33:42,090 --> 00:33:47,490
therefore we can Maksim the amount of

771
00:33:44,970 --> 00:33:50,940
money then researcher get can can get

772
00:33:47,490 --> 00:33:53,820
get paid legal aspect is also important

773
00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:55,890
because from legal perspective broker's

774
00:33:53,820 --> 00:33:59,010
has different entities in different

775
00:33:55,890 --> 00:34:01,710
places around the world and it's their

776
00:33:59,010 --> 00:34:02,510
responsibility to actually provide the

777
00:34:01,710 --> 00:34:06,110
licensing

778
00:34:02,510 --> 00:34:06,470
to export it so if you are a you for

779
00:34:06,110 --> 00:34:09,350
example

780
00:34:06,470 --> 00:34:11,330
EU based researcher and you want to sell

781
00:34:09,350 --> 00:34:14,389
it outside of the EU you're not allowed

782
00:34:11,330 --> 00:34:17,629
to you need licenses but once you work

783
00:34:14,389 --> 00:34:20,480
with brokers with EU entity it's his

784
00:34:17,629 --> 00:34:22,909
responsibility to provide those licenses

785
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:25,270
in order to export it so it's really big

786
00:34:22,909 --> 00:34:27,859
benefit to work with brokers

787
00:34:25,270 --> 00:34:30,080
how does brokers make the money right

788
00:34:27,859 --> 00:34:32,090
because they don't work for free except

789
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:33,080
me and I will tell you all about that in

790
00:34:32,090 --> 00:34:36,379
a second

791
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:40,399
broker fees it's one way to do business

792
00:34:36,379 --> 00:34:41,509
the attack the take X percentage out of

793
00:34:40,399 --> 00:34:44,868
each transaction

794
00:34:41,510 --> 00:34:46,520
another option is reseller meaning that

795
00:34:44,869 --> 00:34:47,929
I am the broker I bought the

796
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:50,869
vulnerability and I will sell it

797
00:34:47,929 --> 00:34:53,210
multiple times it can be if I buy that

798
00:34:50,869 --> 00:34:56,270
exclusive or non-exclusive it doesn't

799
00:34:53,210 --> 00:34:58,310
matter it depend how many clients I have

800
00:34:56,270 --> 00:35:01,100
and what they're willing to offer and

801
00:34:58,310 --> 00:35:04,369
the third one is subscription a yearly

802
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:08,089
or monthly fee that they can if the

803
00:35:04,369 --> 00:35:11,150
government or clients go with that route

804
00:35:08,090 --> 00:35:13,670
they can we can make use of whatever

805
00:35:11,150 --> 00:35:17,660
vulnerability is the the broker board

806
00:35:13,670 --> 00:35:20,780
offer if I'll try to summarize up

807
00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:23,240
everything here there is a don't waste

808
00:35:20,780 --> 00:35:25,119
time on the surday industry if your

809
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:28,220
vulnerability is not mature enough

810
00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:31,220
because it will waste the clients time

811
00:35:28,220 --> 00:35:34,480
and your time it will never it will

812
00:35:31,220 --> 00:35:38,060
never lead to a successful deer deal

813
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:42,380
ensure your vulnerability is ready to

814
00:35:38,060 --> 00:35:44,330
use and your POC stable just because

815
00:35:42,380 --> 00:35:46,070
then I already mentioned that if you

816
00:35:44,330 --> 00:35:49,069
have an item and no one want to buy it

817
00:35:46,070 --> 00:35:52,010
it doesn't really matter right and never

818
00:35:49,070 --> 00:35:56,510
over sale a vulnerability it just will

819
00:35:52,010 --> 00:35:59,030
not work do not this is really important

820
00:35:56,510 --> 00:36:01,700
on the right side you see the bullet

821
00:35:59,030 --> 00:36:03,740
meaning that again finding

822
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:06,020
vulnerabilities and exploit them are two

823
00:36:03,740 --> 00:36:08,959
different set skills the majority of

824
00:36:06,020 --> 00:36:11,460
researchers are focused or expert in one

825
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:13,650
of them so if you have this

826
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:17,010
beautiful vulnerability but the axe what

827
00:36:13,650 --> 00:36:19,620
is the problem please tell it because it

828
00:36:17,010 --> 00:36:21,690
can literally save the deal because

829
00:36:19,620 --> 00:36:23,250
again most of the clients and

830
00:36:21,690 --> 00:36:25,830
governments have an internal research

831
00:36:23,250 --> 00:36:27,810
team and once they understand that they

832
00:36:25,830 --> 00:36:30,480
will be willing to pay you the full

833
00:36:27,810 --> 00:36:32,100
amount or reduce a little bit just

834
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:33,930
because the exploit isn't good enough

835
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:38,100
doesn't matter doesn't mean the

836
00:36:33,930 --> 00:36:41,279
vulnerability isn't never treat or tell

837
00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:44,060
about successful deals because again it

838
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:46,410
can it will breach the confidentially

839
00:36:44,060 --> 00:36:50,220
contract and you don't want to do that

840
00:36:46,410 --> 00:36:52,640
and if you sell non-exclusive try to

841
00:36:50,220 --> 00:36:55,589
limit yourself to three or to four

842
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:57,990
trusted clients because if you will say

843
00:36:55,590 --> 00:37:00,810
that sell it for multiple and multiple

844
00:36:57,990 --> 00:37:02,609
times you will burn the vulnerability

845
00:37:00,810 --> 00:37:05,130
and your credit will be harmed because

846
00:37:02,610 --> 00:37:07,830
of it people would not like to work with

847
00:37:05,130 --> 00:37:09,660
you another aspect of it

848
00:37:07,830 --> 00:37:12,630
it's always listened to feedbacks

849
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:15,750
meaning that if you are Linux researcher

850
00:37:12,630 --> 00:37:18,360
and your client tell you look you should

851
00:37:15,750 --> 00:37:21,000
move to Android you should consider that

852
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:22,890
because the client is believing you and

853
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:26,160
understand that you can actually deliver

854
00:37:22,890 --> 00:37:28,109
if you change the domain and basically

855
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:30,930
they do that because they think it will

856
00:37:28,110 --> 00:37:33,300
be better for you because Android is

857
00:37:30,930 --> 00:37:36,149
more popular than Linux and it's really

858
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:38,760
important to understand that 0 days

859
00:37:36,150 --> 00:37:41,520
lately burn a lot more faster of course

860
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:45,180
when we are talking about browsers so

861
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:48,360
again in fact if someone is one client

862
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:51,950
to offer you I don't know 100 thousand

863
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:54,510
dollars less than the the market itself

864
00:37:51,950 --> 00:37:56,339
sometimes it's the best it's the best

865
00:37:54,510 --> 00:38:00,120
deal and you should take it

866
00:37:56,340 --> 00:38:03,750
and of course transactions sometimes

867
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:08,240
when not go to the entire process but if

868
00:38:03,750 --> 00:38:08,240
they do it's amazing and it's worth it I

869
00:38:08,630 --> 00:38:15,030
already said that that supply and demand

870
00:38:11,460 --> 00:38:17,080
is the most important parameter when you

871
00:38:15,030 --> 00:38:19,180
are selling vulnerability

872
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:22,360
again it's more of the same here that

873
00:38:19,180 --> 00:38:24,430
when this market is flooded you you will

874
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:28,420
have difficult to sell the vulnerability

875
00:38:24,430 --> 00:38:31,390
and exclusive might seem easy to work

876
00:38:28,420 --> 00:38:33,910
around meaning that you you sell one

877
00:38:31,390 --> 00:38:36,100
client exclusively but in the end you'll

878
00:38:33,910 --> 00:38:37,990
sell it multiple times it's really

879
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:40,870
important for you as a researcher to

880
00:38:37,990 --> 00:38:42,700
understand that we all connected all the

881
00:38:40,870 --> 00:38:44,529
clients are talking with each other all

882
00:38:42,700 --> 00:38:46,689
the brokers are talking with each other

883
00:38:44,530 --> 00:38:50,380
so if you do something like that

884
00:38:46,690 --> 00:38:52,570
you will be people we would not want to

885
00:38:50,380 --> 00:38:54,280
work with you in the end because they

886
00:38:52,570 --> 00:38:57,880
would not trust you and this is the most

887
00:38:54,280 --> 00:39:00,010
important part my take away the biggest

888
00:38:57,880 --> 00:39:02,410
take away I want you to take it from

889
00:39:00,010 --> 00:39:05,020
here is just if you want to start

890
00:39:02,410 --> 00:39:08,470
working the easier the industry open a

891
00:39:05,020 --> 00:39:11,800
company because you can work in a very

892
00:39:08,470 --> 00:39:13,870
very legal way in a very traditional way

893
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:16,420
with invoices legal and everything and

894
00:39:13,870 --> 00:39:19,930
it will make your life really easier to

895
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:24,280
do so I promise some tips and tricks

896
00:39:19,930 --> 00:39:26,230
that I gather along the way so from

897
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:29,650
researchers that want to step into this

898
00:39:26,230 --> 00:39:31,620
market and take part of it go play CTFs

899
00:39:29,650 --> 00:39:34,570
CTF is a really good opportunity for

900
00:39:31,620 --> 00:39:37,180
clients to approach you they see how

901
00:39:34,570 --> 00:39:39,940
talented are you and you can again it's

902
00:39:37,180 --> 00:39:42,339
really important for you to do that go

903
00:39:39,940 --> 00:39:44,830
to conferences especially like that I

904
00:39:42,340 --> 00:39:47,170
have so many clients here and it will

905
00:39:44,830 --> 00:39:49,000
approach different researchers just

906
00:39:47,170 --> 00:39:52,030
because they in familiar way they know

907
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:56,050
about read about publish it's really

908
00:39:52,030 --> 00:39:58,870
important get help when in doubt because

909
00:39:56,050 --> 00:40:01,510
again there is a amazing community of

910
00:39:58,870 --> 00:40:03,970
researchers that will help you if you

911
00:40:01,510 --> 00:40:06,640
find something that they will take it

912
00:40:03,970 --> 00:40:08,680
from one level into the next and they're

913
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:11,650
willing to do that for free the majority

914
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:13,629
of them at least and know your shit

915
00:40:11,650 --> 00:40:16,090
never fake it till you make it because

916
00:40:13,630 --> 00:40:18,250
it won't work again the clients are

917
00:40:16,090 --> 00:40:21,720
interested in the end product and they

918
00:40:18,250 --> 00:40:25,140
judge you upon those not anything else

919
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:28,980
how can I help you on your journey

920
00:40:25,140 --> 00:40:31,290
I closed my company a year ago but they

921
00:40:28,980 --> 00:40:33,720
still offer my services for free

922
00:40:31,290 --> 00:40:36,090
people call me nuts but I really loved

923
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:38,279
the industry and I worked with a lot of

924
00:40:36,090 --> 00:40:40,560
researcher and helped them along the way

925
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:44,490
I have a slightly different approach

926
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:46,290
from other brokers but I can just ask me

927
00:40:44,490 --> 00:40:54,899
anything you like I will be more than

928
00:40:46,290 --> 00:40:56,930
happy to help you questions yeah go

929
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:56,930
ahead

930
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:02,920
yeah

931
00:41:06,750 --> 00:41:09,920
I don't hear you

932
00:41:10,110 --> 00:41:16,830
ah okay so he asked if during the

933
00:41:14,010 --> 00:41:19,410
validation period if you already provide

934
00:41:16,830 --> 00:41:21,720
the source code itself so the question

935
00:41:19,410 --> 00:41:23,850
the answer for that is yes because the

936
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:27,180
first step is signing on took a contract

937
00:41:23,850 --> 00:41:29,670
after you sign a contract the client has

938
00:41:27,180 --> 00:41:32,990
to validate your item and they do that

939
00:41:29,670 --> 00:41:32,990
by the source itself

940
00:41:37,069 --> 00:41:43,959
okay so just say I buy one of these zero

941
00:41:39,169 --> 00:41:43,959
days it gets

942
00:41:45,260 --> 00:41:50,820
what contract

943
00:41:48,300 --> 00:41:52,500
it depends okay the question is what

944
00:41:50,820 --> 00:41:55,560
happened if I sold the vulnerability and

945
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:58,290
after six month we got benched so if you

946
00:41:55,560 --> 00:42:00,480
use like in the agreement you said that

947
00:41:58,290 --> 00:42:03,150
you will get paid fifty percent on

948
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:05,130
validation and the rest in three months

949
00:42:03,150 --> 00:42:07,730
chunk nothing will happen you will get

950
00:42:05,130 --> 00:42:07,730
the full amount

951
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:21,240
it doesn't okay the question is if

952
00:42:19,050 --> 00:42:23,910
they're the client has a duplicate what

953
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:25,890
will happen from the client perspective

954
00:42:23,910 --> 00:42:28,680
he will be obligated to tell the full

955
00:42:25,890 --> 00:42:30,930
amount of the item itself because you

956
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:33,660
send them the spec and that's what you

957
00:42:30,930 --> 00:42:37,049
guaranteed if the item do I don't care

958
00:42:33,660 --> 00:42:39,120
in the client like I am as a broker and

959
00:42:37,050 --> 00:42:41,700
you as a researcher don't care that the

960
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:48,240
client already has it so we will pay the

961
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:52,470
full amount I can't see but I have okay

962
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:54,720
so just a question general like what

963
00:42:52,470 --> 00:42:57,060
would be the motivations for clients to

964
00:42:54,720 --> 00:43:00,000
buy vulnerabilities like that if it's

965
00:42:57,060 --> 00:43:02,759
not our product sorry what will be the

966
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:04,890
motivation for a kind to search for a

967
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:07,670
vulnerability if it's not their product

968
00:43:04,890 --> 00:43:10,080
what what are they usually interested in

969
00:43:07,670 --> 00:43:11,970
we're talking about like defensive

970
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:13,710
secret you world right right like we're

971
00:43:11,970 --> 00:43:15,839
on the same page here okay so we're

972
00:43:13,710 --> 00:43:18,990
talking about companies that offer the

973
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:20,910
food products as I mentioned earlier

974
00:43:18,990 --> 00:43:22,979
meaning that they're our company their

975
00:43:20,910 --> 00:43:25,980
governments or government's organization

976
00:43:22,980 --> 00:43:28,800
they don't have the knowledge to create

977
00:43:25,980 --> 00:43:32,100
those kinds of products or vectors so

978
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:34,740
they will buy it Peter by each owner

979
00:43:32,100 --> 00:43:36,990
ability separately or the entire product

980
00:43:34,740 --> 00:43:41,459
on the infrastructure so that's the

981
00:43:36,990 --> 00:43:44,040
motivation yeah

982
00:43:41,460 --> 00:43:46,110
in your experience how many of the

983
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:48,270
transactions that you started or started

984
00:43:46,110 --> 00:43:50,100
down the road on failed burçak succeeded

985
00:43:48,270 --> 00:43:52,080
I know it's a limited sample size sorry

986
00:43:50,100 --> 00:43:53,700
it's a can you please repeat of how many

987
00:43:52,080 --> 00:43:55,590
of the transactions that you started

988
00:43:53,700 --> 00:43:57,960
down the road or research you start

989
00:43:55,590 --> 00:44:01,170
working on how many times did it fail -

990
00:43:57,960 --> 00:44:03,360
it never Preston see him again in my

991
00:44:01,170 --> 00:44:07,710
experience in the past four years never

992
00:44:03,360 --> 00:44:09,540
really when the spec was really good the

993
00:44:07,710 --> 00:44:15,600
client know exactly what is getting I

994
00:44:09,540 --> 00:44:16,910
had zero further right siren of

995
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:19,049
companies that currently have

996
00:44:16,910 --> 00:44:20,640
vulnerability rewards programs or bug

997
00:44:19,050 --> 00:44:23,340
bounties what do you think they can do

998
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:24,279
differently to attract these researchers

999
00:44:23,340 --> 00:44:26,230
instead of that

1000
00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:27,370
to third parties and really far I can't

1001
00:44:26,230 --> 00:44:30,100
hear you

1002
00:44:27,370 --> 00:44:31,660
sorry is that better yeah of companies

1003
00:44:30,100 --> 00:44:33,640
that currently have vulnerability

1004
00:44:31,660 --> 00:44:34,870
rewards programs bug bounties what

1005
00:44:33,640 --> 00:44:36,640
should they do differently to attract

1006
00:44:34,870 --> 00:44:38,350
these researchers aside from you know

1007
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:41,259
paying them a lot more money what were

1008
00:44:38,350 --> 00:44:43,480
things can they do so I have different

1009
00:44:41,260 --> 00:44:46,750
answers to their questions but the

1010
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:48,730
majority of researchers just love the

1011
00:44:46,750 --> 00:44:51,670
fact that they're not reported to the

1012
00:44:48,730 --> 00:44:53,470
front door itself so it's really depends

1013
00:44:51,670 --> 00:44:56,170
because I saw so many bug bounty

1014
00:44:53,470 --> 00:44:58,149
programs that try to aim researchers to

1015
00:44:56,170 --> 00:45:01,360
find the specific vulnerability types

1016
00:44:58,150 --> 00:45:03,730
and they will be really exploitable and

1017
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:05,980
I actually can mitigate them but in

1018
00:45:03,730 --> 00:45:08,590
reality the majority of researchers that

1019
00:45:05,980 --> 00:45:10,420
participate in this or the industry they

1020
00:45:08,590 --> 00:45:12,640
just want to get the money and the

1021
00:45:10,420 --> 00:45:13,680
thrill out of it so it's a little bit of

1022
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:17,259
a problem

1023
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:20,080
thanks you mentioned that there were 400

1024
00:45:17,260 --> 00:45:24,130
people involved and worldwide and

1025
00:45:20,080 --> 00:45:28,150
selling as a broker how do you find them

1026
00:45:24,130 --> 00:45:31,810
or do they find you it goes both way I

1027
00:45:28,150 --> 00:45:34,240
think because again this is part of my

1028
00:45:31,810 --> 00:45:36,370
day to day job so I connect with a lot

1029
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:40,299
of researchers and they of course

1030
00:45:36,370 --> 00:45:42,970
connect me as well in my case or Farrell

1031
00:45:40,300 --> 00:45:45,640
is really part of it because if you help

1032
00:45:42,970 --> 00:45:48,069
researcher to sell the item he and he

1033
00:45:45,640 --> 00:45:51,359
had a really good experience with you he

1034
00:45:48,070 --> 00:45:54,100
will refer other to you as well

1035
00:45:51,360 --> 00:45:56,860
you mentioned in your talk that you said

1036
00:45:54,100 --> 00:45:59,730
that O'Day's burned a lot faster because

1037
00:45:56,860 --> 00:46:03,640
of zero and so can you expand on that

1038
00:45:59,730 --> 00:46:06,820
yep every time project zero usually

1039
00:46:03,640 --> 00:46:10,629
publish three or four vulnerabilities

1040
00:46:06,820 --> 00:46:12,940
they close the same vulnerabilities into

1041
00:46:10,630 --> 00:46:15,160
the industry again there is a lot of

1042
00:46:12,940 --> 00:46:18,460
talented researchers in the offensive

1043
00:46:15,160 --> 00:46:20,879
security industry they don't just

1044
00:46:18,460 --> 00:46:23,410
publish or report to the vendor and the

1045
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:26,170
majority of bugs that project zero

1046
00:46:23,410 --> 00:46:28,359
already found that the researchers in

1047
00:46:26,170 --> 00:46:30,820
the offensive security industry found

1048
00:46:28,360 --> 00:46:33,090
them and exploit them and even use them

1049
00:46:30,820 --> 00:46:36,070
in the wild

1050
00:46:33,090 --> 00:46:37,630
as more countries are adding

1051
00:46:36,070 --> 00:46:40,480
vulnerabilities equities processed

1052
00:46:37,630 --> 00:46:42,970
programs how does that affect the

1053
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:45,220
offensive sale are they adding in that

1054
00:46:42,970 --> 00:46:46,930
this has to go through the vet process

1055
00:46:45,220 --> 00:46:49,120
for example within the United States or

1056
00:46:46,930 --> 00:46:51,430
other countries with vet programs sorry

1057
00:46:49,120 --> 00:46:53,049
again I forgot it

1058
00:46:51,430 --> 00:46:55,060
it's really depends because if we're

1059
00:46:53,050 --> 00:46:57,880
talking about bugcrowd that hacker one

1060
00:46:55,060 --> 00:46:59,560
the only a platform in the end the the

1061
00:46:57,880 --> 00:47:01,390
vendor itself

1062
00:46:59,560 --> 00:47:02,620
is the client and he will get

1063
00:47:01,390 --> 00:47:06,370
vulnerability

1064
00:47:02,620 --> 00:47:09,100
I got it correctly or I mean to the US

1065
00:47:06,370 --> 00:47:11,560
process US government process is that if

1066
00:47:09,100 --> 00:47:13,240
they're in possession of a vulnerability

1067
00:47:11,560 --> 00:47:15,700
it needs to go through an interagency

1068
00:47:13,240 --> 00:47:18,069
review process I would think that would

1069
00:47:15,700 --> 00:47:19,390
affect does that matter to you or once

1070
00:47:18,070 --> 00:47:21,700
you sell it to them as part of the

1071
00:47:19,390 --> 00:47:23,799
contract what they have to do to see if

1072
00:47:21,700 --> 00:47:25,450
they're gonna disclose to the vendor for

1073
00:47:23,800 --> 00:47:27,130
the internal process with the US

1074
00:47:25,450 --> 00:47:30,910
government does that matter to use the

1075
00:47:27,130 --> 00:47:32,200
broker or to the researcher I'm much

1076
00:47:30,910 --> 00:47:36,310
more than this done of course I'm real

1077
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:38,129
sorry okay is it okay thanks okay I'll

1078
00:47:36,310 --> 00:47:46,328
try to answer that later if it's okay

1079
00:47:38,130 --> 00:47:49,239
okay yeah amen okay

1080
00:47:46,329 --> 00:47:51,309
and I want to go up there zero days out

1081
00:47:49,239 --> 00:47:53,100
there available for that product but I

1082
00:47:51,309 --> 00:47:55,680
go to

1083
00:47:53,100 --> 00:47:59,970
I'll die

1084
00:47:55,680 --> 00:48:02,330
first idea

1085
00:47:59,970 --> 00:48:07,069
I think they advised

1086
00:48:02,330 --> 00:48:09,100
who will lie to you I'm if you want to

1087
00:48:07,070 --> 00:48:12,440
buy a product from another government

1088
00:48:09,100 --> 00:48:15,170
okay it's really okay

1089
00:48:12,440 --> 00:48:17,840
usually companies like product companies

1090
00:48:15,170 --> 00:48:20,270
do not sell to individual or other

1091
00:48:17,840 --> 00:48:22,730
companies they only sell it to

1092
00:48:20,270 --> 00:48:26,360
government because its dual use then you

1093
00:48:22,730 --> 00:48:29,119
have an end user and use certificate so

1094
00:48:26,360 --> 00:48:32,380
not in like companies cannot issue them

1095
00:48:29,119 --> 00:48:35,510
only governments and for this is the

1096
00:48:32,380 --> 00:48:38,030
second question the first one so if you

1097
00:48:35,510 --> 00:48:41,090
want to buy anything usually as a client

1098
00:48:38,030 --> 00:48:43,610
for like company or government the

1099
00:48:41,090 --> 00:48:46,310
easiest way is to go through brokers but

1100
00:48:43,610 --> 00:48:47,960
again you can open your own team that

1101
00:48:46,310 --> 00:48:50,600
buy and acquire them and actually

1102
00:48:47,960 --> 00:48:56,119
publish official point of contact for

1103
00:48:50,600 --> 00:49:00,430
example yeah I got a question is the

1104
00:48:56,119 --> 00:49:04,010
Reznor agreement so they impacted the

1105
00:49:00,430 --> 00:49:07,640
zero typewriter industry a lot the

1106
00:49:04,010 --> 00:49:10,310
Wassenaar green changed game rules like

1107
00:49:07,640 --> 00:49:13,490
from one one way to another because

1108
00:49:10,310 --> 00:49:16,250
today researcher do understand that if

1109
00:49:13,490 --> 00:49:17,270
they don't have the licenses there are

1110
00:49:16,250 --> 00:49:20,480
really big trouble

1111
00:49:17,270 --> 00:49:25,240
so I publish on Twitter like few weeks

1112
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:28,220
ago that the Google offered three three

1113
00:49:25,240 --> 00:49:30,919
thirteen thirty thousand one hundred

1114
00:49:28,220 --> 00:49:33,649
dollars I think no early something

1115
00:49:30,920 --> 00:49:35,990
dollars for a sandbox escape from Chrome

1116
00:49:33,650 --> 00:49:40,040
and the value of the market it's like

1117
00:49:35,990 --> 00:49:43,430
around six hundred thousand so people

1118
00:49:40,040 --> 00:49:46,279
say that the market is not regulated but

1119
00:49:43,430 --> 00:49:48,589
it truly is because researcher

1120
00:49:46,280 --> 00:49:50,359
understand that clients the open

1121
00:49:48,590 --> 00:49:53,540
different subsidiaries in different

1122
00:49:50,359 --> 00:49:55,759
countries in order to to be able to

1123
00:49:53,540 --> 00:49:58,759
acquire vulnerabilities from different

1124
00:49:55,760 --> 00:50:01,340
entities so to answer your question yes

1125
00:49:58,760 --> 00:50:03,650
a lot so they just bypassing the

1126
00:50:01,340 --> 00:50:05,450
agreement sorry I just bypassed the

1127
00:50:03,650 --> 00:50:08,690
agreement by opening up companies in

1128
00:50:05,450 --> 00:50:10,250
other countries does the roster agree

1129
00:50:08,690 --> 00:50:12,620
they bypassed

1130
00:50:10,250 --> 00:50:14,630
wasn't our restrictions by opening I

1131
00:50:12,620 --> 00:50:17,180
will be more than happy to help you but

1132
00:50:14,630 --> 00:50:18,950
I running out of time so I'm right here

1133
00:50:17,180 --> 00:50:20,419
if anyone want to ask anything thank you

1134
00:50:18,950 --> 00:50:24,359
very much for your time

1135
00:50:20,420 --> 00:50:24,360
[Applause]
