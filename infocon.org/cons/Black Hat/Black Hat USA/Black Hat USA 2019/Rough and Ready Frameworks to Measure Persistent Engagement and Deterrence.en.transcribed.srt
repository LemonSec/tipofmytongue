1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,780
good morning everyone welcome to

2
00:00:01,589 --> 00:00:06,000
rough-and-ready frameworks to measure

3
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:09,059
persistent engagement and deterrence in

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,059
breakers GHI we're here to listen to

5
00:00:09,059 --> 00:00:14,549
Jason Healy and Neil Jenkins before we

6
00:00:12,059 --> 00:00:16,259
begin a few brief notes as always stop

7
00:00:14,549 --> 00:00:18,090
by the business hall and located on

8
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:20,310
Mandalay Bay Oceanside and shoreline

9
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:21,810
ballrooms on level 2 and of course

10
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:23,070
please put your phone on vibrate it

11
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:35,460
makes it easier for all of us to ignore

12
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:36,809
that ringing thank you everyone all

13
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:38,910
right thank you how you doing good

14
00:00:36,809 --> 00:00:41,550
morning my name is Neil Jenkins this is

15
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:44,429
Jason Healy we're gonna talk to you a

16
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:46,230
little bit today about some things that

17
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:47,340
we've been looking at for frameworks to

18
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:49,410
look at how the US government

19
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:52,530
specifically the Department of Defense

20
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:55,559
is looking at some policy actions some

21
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:56,670
potential offensive cyber operations and

22
00:00:55,559 --> 00:00:57,959
they talk about some frameworks that we

23
00:00:56,670 --> 00:01:00,480
want to use to actually try and measure

24
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:02,940
that so we can take a look at what the

25
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:04,830
impacts will be so we've talked a little

26
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:06,689
bit about this in the past it cyber work

27
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:08,250
on and it's saikhan we've been

28
00:01:06,689 --> 00:01:09,658
developing the framework and building it

29
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:12,240
with a lot of input from the community

30
00:01:09,659 --> 00:01:13,380
and this is another step to do that and

31
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,699
to talk about some of the work we've

32
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:18,689
done some of the future work that we're

33
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:20,189
doing so my name is Neil Jenkins I'm the

34
00:01:18,689 --> 00:01:22,439
chief analytic officer at the cyber

35
00:01:20,189 --> 00:01:24,179
threat Alliance we are a cooperative

36
00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:25,559
group of cyber security companies that

37
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:28,340
have come together to share information

38
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:31,560
and collaborate on operational issues

39
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:33,329
essentially if we're looking at the

40
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:35,369
Avengers and superheroes like each of

41
00:01:33,329 --> 00:01:37,110
our companies has great powers and are

42
00:01:35,369 --> 00:01:38,400
awesome on their own but every once a

43
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:39,960
while we would need to come together and

44
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:42,119
share that information and work together

45
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:44,729
on big problems so that's our that's

46
00:01:42,119 --> 00:01:46,140
what we're doing I'm Jason Healy I'm a

47
00:01:44,729 --> 00:01:47,520
senior research scholar at Columbia

48
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:51,270
University good to see some of the

49
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:54,119
alumni here and I've got a background I

50
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:56,990
came out of the Air Force help set up

51
00:01:54,119 --> 00:02:00,119
the first Cyber Command back in 1998 and

52
00:01:56,990 --> 00:02:01,679
goldman-sachs White House and then

53
00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:03,390
helped set up a cyber programmer to

54
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:07,079
think-tank the Atlantic Council I'm on

55
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:08,699
the DEFCON talked review board oh and I

56
00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:09,899
don't think it affects here but I've

57
00:02:08,699 --> 00:02:11,730
seen it in some of the other conferences

58
00:02:09,899 --> 00:02:13,240
in some of the other talks if you're

59
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:17,170
wearing a tie you're in the wrong

60
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:22,090
that's RSA and so know you know you

61
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:24,100
don't need that here so how many folks

62
00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:25,960
are familiar is seeing the strategy of

63
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:27,370
persistent engagement for defense and

64
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:29,830
what when what Department of Defense is

65
00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:33,970
going to do okay so we'll spend just a

66
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:36,250
touch of time on this because it is the

67
00:02:33,970 --> 00:02:38,440
most significant changes I've seen in

68
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:41,470
twenty years of looking at military

69
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:42,730
cyber policy and so we'll start with

70
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:44,440
some of the quotes and then we'll get

71
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:48,070
into what it actually means and a little

72
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:49,690
bit more depth so this was um John

73
00:02:48,070 --> 00:02:53,350
Bolton the president's national security

74
00:02:49,690 --> 00:02:55,329
adviser talking about why why this

75
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:57,519
administration wants to do more

76
00:02:55,330 --> 00:02:59,440
offensive cyber operations and all and

77
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:02,410
what we what they might call defensive

78
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:05,170
cyber FX operations count a using cyber

79
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:06,340
to counter the other guys cyber and he's

80
00:03:05,170 --> 00:03:08,380
saying that we want to do this not

81
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:09,250
because we want more more attacks in the

82
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:11,380
world but we want to create the

83
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:13,420
structures of deterrence he said our

84
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:15,910
hands are no longer tied the way they

85
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:17,739
were under the Obama administration and

86
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:20,140
he said if you look the thing we wanted

87
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:22,840
to deter things you know things like OPM

88
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:24,369
or the hack by China are exactly the

89
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:27,370
kind of things that we want to hit and

90
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:29,260
that we want to stop on just a couple of

91
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:31,780
weeks ago general Milley in his

92
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:34,780
confirmation testimony as the new

93
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:37,300
chairman of Joint Chiefs of Staff when

94
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:41,470
prompted by senator Blumenthal said yes

95
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:45,010
the a good offense is the best defense

96
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:46,840
and that if we increase our offensive

97
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:48,480
capability then that's going to get the

98
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:50,770
other side to back down

99
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:53,350
general naka sony has put it in slightly

100
00:03:50,770 --> 00:03:57,340
different terms he's the commander of US

101
00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:59,470
Cyber Command and the director of NSA he

102
00:03:57,340 --> 00:04:01,900
talks to us about having the capability

103
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:04,300
rather than you have to it's just not

104
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:06,490
having the capability you must use the

105
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:09,640
capability and we're gonna use the

106
00:04:06,490 --> 00:04:12,790
capability to impose cumulative costs on

107
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:14,950
the other side and but he does agree

108
00:04:12,790 --> 00:04:17,349
about the the best defense is a good

109
00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:19,570
offense and that we have to take the

110
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:21,609
fight to the enemy and take it into his

111
00:04:19,570 --> 00:04:23,919
and others networks so that we're not

112
00:04:21,608 --> 00:04:25,900
fighting in our own networks so it

113
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:27,039
really is a very significant change from

114
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:29,500
what we've seen over the

115
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:31,420
previous 20 years and so the debate is

116
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:33,190
you know will this work or not

117
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:36,160
or what are going to be the outcomes of

118
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:38,530
a more kind of this persistent

119
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:40,150
engagement defend forward activity that

120
00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:42,729
the US military is talking about doing

121
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:44,919
so there's clearly the hawkish view the

122
00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:46,600
that a more forceful approach is going

123
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:48,160
to lead to deterrence it's going to make

124
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:50,410
our adversaries more tame and it's going

125
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:51,670
to decrease the number of cyber

126
00:04:50,410 --> 00:04:54,370
incidents that we're having to deal with

127
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:56,170
on a regular basis the alternative is

128
00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:57,790
not necessarily the dovish view because

129
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:59,830
I wouldn't consider myself a dove in

130
00:04:57,790 --> 00:05:01,960
this area in particular but more of an

131
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:04,000
out list view right kind of a we're a

132
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:06,549
little more cautious and worried that

133
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,930
the activity that the US government is

134
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:09,550
talking about doing may backfire and

135
00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:11,650
actually may lead to more attacks if

136
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:13,780
there's more offensive cyber stuff going

137
00:05:11,650 --> 00:05:16,090
on in the system and is that just gonna

138
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:17,979
kind of create a scenario where more and

139
00:05:16,090 --> 00:05:19,840
more and more attacks build and build so

140
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:22,360
but the thing is there's little evidence

141
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:24,010
either way can I ask you how many folks

142
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:25,420
would agree right now with the hawkish

143
00:05:24,010 --> 00:05:26,560
view and say we've got it we've got to

144
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:27,640
be fighting back and that's gonna make

145
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:30,220
things you know that's gonna make things

146
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:33,700
better how many are it would be kind of

147
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:36,220
more our wish and say well yeah okay so

148
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:38,409
it I would say it was about maybe 2 to 1

149
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:40,600
on the owlish versus hawks and I think

150
00:05:38,410 --> 00:05:42,010
that's entirely fair yep and I think

151
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:43,180
that the thing that we're trying to get

152
00:05:42,010 --> 00:05:46,060
to is that there's little evidence

153
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:48,100
either way that it's gonna work that way

154
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:50,620
right like we can't there's not a lot of

155
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:52,210
public data that's out there about these

156
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:54,190
incidents there's not a lot of baseline

157
00:05:52,210 --> 00:05:55,690
then we have to build on so we need to

158
00:05:54,190 --> 00:05:59,050
start collecting that so let's fix that

159
00:05:55,690 --> 00:05:59,500
if anyone tell like I happen to be an

160
00:05:59,050 --> 00:06:01,900
owl

161
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:03,610
I respect my friends that are Hawks but

162
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:06,190
neither of us are working on evidence

163
00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:08,950
for the most part when we're making

164
00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:11,110
these arguments about Hawks or doves or

165
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:12,490
or owls we're largely doing our gut

166
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:14,350
reaction enemy that's based on

167
00:06:12,490 --> 00:06:15,940
experience and it's based on our art you

168
00:06:14,350 --> 00:06:17,590
are history in the field and it's based

169
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:20,200
on how we think adversaries are gonna

170
00:06:17,590 --> 00:06:22,539
respond and that and that's all useful

171
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:24,400
but we've got to do better like we're

172
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:26,350
about to start getting into a fight with

173
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:28,810
Russians Chinese military and

174
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:29,560
intelligence forces so so we have to do

175
00:06:28,810 --> 00:06:33,970
better than that

176
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:35,919
and it it comes down to it's a policy

177
00:06:33,970 --> 00:06:37,870
question right we're getting down this

178
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:40,210
isn't just us clock some hacker data and

179
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:40,569
and then let's compare it's getting down

180
00:06:40,210 --> 00:06:41,979
to

181
00:06:40,569 --> 00:06:44,439
are we meeting the goals of the

182
00:06:41,979 --> 00:06:45,938
policymakers right when the national

183
00:06:44,439 --> 00:06:47,229
security of eyes are in the when general

184
00:06:45,939 --> 00:06:48,520
Milley are saying all right we do this

185
00:06:47,229 --> 00:06:51,039
it's going to be getting better we've

186
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:52,209
got to look at a really large view and

187
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:53,740
figure out all right what are the goals

188
00:06:52,209 --> 00:06:54,999
that they're trying to accomplish and

189
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:58,300
let's work for that

190
00:06:54,999 --> 00:07:00,909
so we first off we need a structured

191
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:02,110
causal theory I'm an academic now I get

192
00:07:00,909 --> 00:07:04,959
to say stuff like that and not sound

193
00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:07,809
pretentious all antennas we need so

194
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:10,599
what's the cause and effect that Cyber

195
00:07:07,809 --> 00:07:13,419
Command and the and become persistent

196
00:07:10,599 --> 00:07:14,589
engage this persistent engagement so

197
00:07:13,419 --> 00:07:17,740
we're the board of the persistent

198
00:07:14,589 --> 00:07:20,139
engagers saying so first they say the

199
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:23,050
adversaries are trying to destabilize us

200
00:07:20,139 --> 00:07:25,180
take away our power the status quo is

201
00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:28,330
unacceptable that's step one

202
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:29,499
step ten is what we want and so if you

203
00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:31,300
read the documents from the

204
00:07:29,499 --> 00:07:34,059
administration and viewed the Department

205
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:35,619
of Defense and they say we want a more

206
00:07:34,059 --> 00:07:37,959
stable environment and you as a

207
00:07:35,619 --> 00:07:41,319
superiority so their goal is both

208
00:07:37,959 --> 00:07:43,389
stability and superiority may not be

209
00:07:41,319 --> 00:07:45,519
able to get both but and so how do you

210
00:07:43,389 --> 00:07:47,740
get there so there implied the implied

211
00:07:45,519 --> 00:07:51,490
cause and effect is hey we're gonna

212
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:54,430
defend forward we need to do that with

213
00:07:51,490 --> 00:07:56,110
reduced operational constraints those

214
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:57,909
reduce operational constraints are both

215
00:07:56,110 --> 00:08:00,669
getting they've got a little bit more of

216
00:07:57,909 --> 00:08:02,169
a free hand from Congress as well as

217
00:08:00,669 --> 00:08:04,359
from the White House of saying yeah you

218
00:08:02,169 --> 00:08:05,769
need to come to us less frequently you

219
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:08,639
don't need to get stuff approved by the

220
00:08:05,769 --> 00:08:12,039
president you can do more on your own

221
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:14,219
using that and defending forward they're

222
00:08:12,039 --> 00:08:17,259
going to get in an intercept and halt

223
00:08:14,219 --> 00:08:23,349
adversary attacks as close to the source

224
00:08:17,259 --> 00:08:25,809
as they can that will help improve US

225
00:08:23,349 --> 00:08:27,909
defenses so for example if we're in the

226
00:08:25,809 --> 00:08:29,259
the GR youth development network

227
00:08:27,909 --> 00:08:31,029
oh man that's going to give us really

228
00:08:29,259 --> 00:08:33,009
cool stuff that we can use to make sure

229
00:08:31,029 --> 00:08:34,929
that we can defend against that if we're

230
00:08:33,009 --> 00:08:36,459
seeing if we're in the enemy's command

231
00:08:34,929 --> 00:08:38,468
and control systems well that will help

232
00:08:36,458 --> 00:08:40,268
improve our defenses so that we can be

233
00:08:38,469 --> 00:08:43,779
ready for those attacks when they're

234
00:08:40,269 --> 00:08:45,630
going to happen also by being in those

235
00:08:43,779 --> 00:08:48,430
systems we are going to be directly

236
00:08:45,630 --> 00:08:49,959
imposing friction right if we see the

237
00:08:48,430 --> 00:08:52,540
command and control network of the GRU

238
00:08:49,959 --> 00:08:54,130
we take it down they're not going to be

239
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:55,540
able to use it against us

240
00:08:54,130 --> 00:08:57,700
we're not trying to do it deter them

241
00:08:55,540 --> 00:09:00,150
we're trying to do it to directly stop

242
00:08:57,700 --> 00:09:04,420
that attack so that it doesn't affect us

243
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:07,000
as we are affecting in this example the

244
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:10,930
GRU Network we're not just stopping that

245
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:13,360
attack we're forcing them to rebuild

246
00:09:10,930 --> 00:09:15,670
those Network rebuild those capabilities

247
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:17,740
so that they've got less money and

248
00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:19,089
resources to come at us all right if

249
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:23,200
they're having to rebuild infrastructure

250
00:09:19,090 --> 00:09:25,150
and rebuild their their arsenal that's

251
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:26,410
that's fewer resources than they're

252
00:09:25,150 --> 00:09:28,090
going to be able to deploy against us

253
00:09:26,410 --> 00:09:32,319
right so we're reducing their ability to

254
00:09:28,090 --> 00:09:34,030
attack over the medium term the Cyber

255
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:36,190
Command talked a lot this last but it's

256
00:09:34,030 --> 00:09:38,860
come up in the authors of the strategy

257
00:09:36,190 --> 00:09:40,590
who are some academics and they argue

258
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:43,300
there's this process of tacit bargaining

259
00:09:40,590 --> 00:09:45,280
saying oh look we're never gonna do

260
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:48,099
agree with the Russians Chinese Iranian

261
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:50,380
North Koreans on the negotiating tables

262
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:52,840
of Geneva about what the rules are going

263
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:55,810
to be not gonna happen or it's not

264
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:59,200
anytime soon but the fighters in the pit

265
00:09:55,810 --> 00:10:00,819
in the moment we can figure it out we

266
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:02,860
can get in there and just wrestling and

267
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:04,300
by throwing elbows around we're gonna

268
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:07,330
figure out what the rules are gonna be

269
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:08,709
just being in the fight where the

270
00:10:07,330 --> 00:10:10,690
Chinese or the Russians with us are

271
00:10:08,710 --> 00:10:12,820
gonna say oh wow okay that thing you're

272
00:10:10,690 --> 00:10:15,430
really coming at us hard we're gonna do

273
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:17,740
less of that because it's clear that you

274
00:10:15,430 --> 00:10:20,829
see this as a step too far and likewise

275
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:22,840
that we'll learn what they consider the

276
00:10:20,830 --> 00:10:27,040
red lines again not because they say it

277
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:30,850
but because we're in the fight separate

278
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:33,250
from that is deterrence like you saw the

279
00:10:30,850 --> 00:10:36,550
New York Times article from David Sanger

280
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:39,760
Nicole Roth that were in the Russian

281
00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:41,920
power grid well we're not doing that to

282
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:44,080
stop their cyber attacks specifically

283
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:47,199
we're doing it because they're in our

284
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:48,550
grid and now we can have this we're

285
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:50,110
holding them at risk they're holding us

286
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:51,609
at risk and if they go too far they know

287
00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:53,710
we can take down their grid that's

288
00:10:51,610 --> 00:10:55,360
separate and so what Cyber Command and

289
00:10:53,710 --> 00:10:58,450
the others are saying this is the

290
00:10:55,360 --> 00:11:01,090
process if we do these things we get to

291
00:10:58,450 --> 00:11:03,730
step 10 over the over the medium and

292
00:11:01,090 --> 00:11:06,640
long term and we get stability in

293
00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:07,480
superiority and so what we want to try

294
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:09,100
to do

295
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:10,149
is find a way to measure this and of

296
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:11,589
course we're not gonna be able to

297
00:11:10,149 --> 00:11:12,699
measure it exactly we're not talking

298
00:11:11,589 --> 00:11:14,889
about some kind of actual physical

299
00:11:12,699 --> 00:11:17,859
science here we're done about political

300
00:11:14,889 --> 00:11:19,870
science we're looking at ways to put a

301
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:22,060
put a framework around this so we can

302
00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:23,350
start looking at it and start trying to

303
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:25,089
collect some information and start

304
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:27,760
making some judgments and assessments of

305
00:11:25,089 --> 00:11:28,690
it and so we're trying to figure out you

306
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:30,069
know are we gonna get some negative

307
00:11:28,690 --> 00:11:31,990
feedback from this approach or some

308
00:11:30,070 --> 00:11:33,790
positive feedback from this approach so

309
00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:36,459
think about the thermostat in your home

310
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:39,099
right negative feedback is if it gets

311
00:11:36,459 --> 00:11:40,719
warm in your house the air conditioning

312
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:43,180
comes on tries to lower the temperature

313
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:45,490
so is that what's gonna happen here as

314
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:46,839
the US government tries to do some of

315
00:11:45,490 --> 00:11:49,240
these defend forward persistent

316
00:11:46,839 --> 00:11:50,860
engagement activities is it are they

317
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:52,420
gonna push a little bit and then it get

318
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:54,220
kind of the system the adversary so

319
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:56,380
they're gonna push back I'll push

320
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:59,560
pattern and kind of reduce the tension

321
00:11:56,380 --> 00:12:01,180
across the across the spectrum we're

322
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:03,099
gonna see a decrease in these extreme

323
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:05,469
events that happen he's destabilizing

324
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:07,120
significant cyber incidents alternately

325
00:12:05,470 --> 00:12:07,990
alternatively are we going to be looking

326
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:10,449
at some kind of positive feedback

327
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:12,940
situation right like your car driving on

328
00:12:10,449 --> 00:12:14,709
us on an icy road where if you tilt the

329
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:16,029
steering wheel just a little bit if your

330
00:12:14,709 --> 00:12:17,739
wheels are bad you know you start to

331
00:12:16,029 --> 00:12:19,750
spin out in the back right you get a big

332
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:21,699
reaction out of a small thing are we

333
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:24,130
gonna see some kind of scenario where a

334
00:12:21,699 --> 00:12:26,829
US counter-offensive amplifies the

335
00:12:24,130 --> 00:12:28,300
trends and causes some because it's more

336
00:12:26,829 --> 00:12:30,310
of these kinds of things we get further

337
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:31,510
and further away from the previous norms

338
00:12:30,310 --> 00:12:33,518
let me get an increase in this

339
00:12:31,510 --> 00:12:34,569
aggressive behavior and then have paper

340
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:36,160
that's gonna come out and Journal

341
00:12:34,569 --> 00:12:37,660
cybersecurity like that's into the the

342
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:39,339
positive negative feedback a little bit

343
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:41,860
more but you should get the idea for

344
00:12:39,339 --> 00:12:42,760
here DoD is in the persistent engagers

345
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:45,459
we're saying it's going to give negative

346
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:46,870
feedback the owls are saying maybe it

347
00:12:45,459 --> 00:12:48,699
might do that but it's possible the

348
00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:52,600
signals from positive feedback are going

349
00:12:48,699 --> 00:12:54,099
to be stronger so the government's not

350
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:56,410
only saying how they're planning on

351
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:59,410
measuring it from the folks I've talked

352
00:12:56,410 --> 00:13:01,269
to and from what I know in my own

353
00:12:59,410 --> 00:13:03,279
military background the military is

354
00:13:01,269 --> 00:13:04,930
going to do great at saying all right we

355
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:07,269
want to change the adversary behavior

356
00:13:04,930 --> 00:13:09,939
we've got the specific adversary group

357
00:13:07,269 --> 00:13:12,880
doing these specific things so you know

358
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:14,920
apt whatever the GRU the the Ministry of

359
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:16,959
State Security of China they're going to

360
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:18,519
have good operational plans to say what

361
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:20,069
can we do to stop these specific

362
00:13:18,519 --> 00:13:22,709
operation these campaigns and

363
00:13:20,070 --> 00:13:24,240
how long are we expected to see that but

364
00:13:22,709 --> 00:13:24,989
if that's not tied to the policymaker

365
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:27,120
goals right

366
00:13:24,990 --> 00:13:29,310
they didn't promise that this was going

367
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:31,440
to change a few adversaries over time

368
00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:34,739
they said this is gonna make the whole

369
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:36,480
thing back and you're not gonna get that

370
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:37,920
I mean this is like body count or this

371
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:39,089
is like we're shooting at the

372
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:41,069
adversaries and they're keeping their

373
00:13:39,089 --> 00:13:42,779
head down well that's not how you win in

374
00:13:41,069 --> 00:13:44,160
Afghanistan or a rock right you don't

375
00:13:42,779 --> 00:13:45,209
just you don't win by just shooting so

376
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:47,009
the other guy keeps their head down

377
00:13:45,209 --> 00:13:48,899
you've got a you've got a play to win

378
00:13:47,009 --> 00:13:50,790
I'm worried you gotta aim for what the

379
00:13:48,899 --> 00:13:52,920
policymaker goals were so there's a

380
00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:58,649
group called the National the knick it's

381
00:13:52,920 --> 00:14:00,630
the top level analytical body that the

382
00:13:58,649 --> 00:14:03,480
intelligence community we assume they're

383
00:14:00,630 --> 00:14:05,339
going to be doing some work on this but

384
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:06,660
if this can't just be the government

385
00:14:05,339 --> 00:14:09,990
right they're not gonna have the

386
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:11,670
datasets that we all have in there might

387
00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:14,160
be a lot of motivated reasoning right

388
00:14:11,670 --> 00:14:15,509
they want to get to YES on this they

389
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:17,160
would like to find out we're gonna do

390
00:14:15,509 --> 00:14:18,750
like we're doing in Afghanistan and in

391
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:20,880
Iraq we're almost we're almost there

392
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:22,589
boss just give us just give us another

393
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:23,670
year just give us another couple of

394
00:14:22,589 --> 00:14:26,790
thousand troops oh we're gonna win this

395
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:28,680
sumbitch and so they really need folks

396
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:31,889
that have our perspectives and our kinds

397
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:33,689
of datasets and so let's talk about some

398
00:14:31,889 --> 00:14:35,970
of the basic frameworks we could use to

399
00:14:33,690 --> 00:14:37,860
start measuring this activity we've got

400
00:14:35,970 --> 00:14:39,180
three that we outline here that we can

401
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:41,069
play with they all have their own

402
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:42,779
strengths and weaknesses but we'll walk

403
00:14:41,069 --> 00:14:44,610
through them in the next few slides and

404
00:14:42,779 --> 00:14:47,130
these were in our original these were in

405
00:14:44,610 --> 00:14:48,660
our paper and then when we get the

406
00:14:47,130 --> 00:14:50,699
future work we'll be talking about the

407
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:52,889
next model that we have so the first one

408
00:14:50,699 --> 00:14:54,870
we could use is actually use what the US

409
00:14:52,889 --> 00:14:56,010
government is using when it comes to

410
00:14:54,870 --> 00:14:57,480
measuring seeing anything in cyber

411
00:14:56,010 --> 00:14:58,800
instance and determining whether or not

412
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:01,380
something is a significant cyber

413
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:03,719
incident this is the US government's

414
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:07,199
incident severity schema it's actually

415
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:09,600
out public and available first appeared

416
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:11,040
publicly in some of the material around

417
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:12,660
the release of presidential policy

418
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:15,480
directive 41 which is about cyber

419
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:16,949
incident response and it's also in some

420
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:19,470
of the appendices of the national cyber

421
00:15:16,949 --> 00:15:22,979
instant response plan but the basic idea

422
00:15:19,470 --> 00:15:24,899
is let's look at a let's look at an

423
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:28,050
incident that's happening and let's make

424
00:15:24,899 --> 00:15:29,870
an assessment of how it impacts public

425
00:15:28,050 --> 00:15:32,279
health or safety national security

426
00:15:29,870 --> 00:15:33,860
economic security Foreign Relations

427
00:15:32,279 --> 00:15:35,900
civil liberties or

428
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:38,870
the confidence and then make a judgment

429
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:40,640
on those things and there's all sorts of

430
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:42,050
ways you can do that there are elements

431
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:43,340
of the US government I know from my time

432
00:15:42,050 --> 00:15:45,979
at the Department of Homeland Security

433
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:48,200
we had an actual kind of system that we

434
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:50,330
could go into and plug different metrics

435
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:53,480
into like how big is the entity that's

436
00:15:50,330 --> 00:15:55,250
been impacted what what what financial

437
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:56,150
impact we expect to come out of this all

438
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:57,920
these kinds of things and it would

439
00:15:56,150 --> 00:15:59,449
output a number that would kind of give

440
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,829
us somewhere on this level and then we

441
00:15:59,450 --> 00:16:03,020
could kind of wing it a little bit and

442
00:16:00,830 --> 00:16:04,280
say well the number said it was a 2 but

443
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:05,720
this seems to be serious enough we're

444
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:07,220
gonna bump it up to a 3 and that kind of

445
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:09,140
thing and then once it gets up to that

446
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:11,600
level three specific actions get taken

447
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:12,920
like things get stood up interagency

448
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:15,140
coordination begins to happen those

449
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:17,959
kinds of things so we as a community

450
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:19,580
could start using the schema to try and

451
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:21,460
talk in the same language that the US

452
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:23,870
government presumably still talks in

453
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:26,180
that's gonna lead to some issues right

454
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:27,590
we may not make the same judgement when

455
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:30,260
we look at an incident that the federal

456
00:16:27,590 --> 00:16:32,000
government may make it may be a little

457
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:34,310
too simple for this but maybe in the

458
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,900
first kind of all three our first kind

459
00:16:34,310 --> 00:16:37,339
of times we try to do this may be simple

460
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:38,630
the right approach right like let's

461
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:40,370
start simple to start learning something

462
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:42,020
we'll start building on it the other

463
00:16:40,370 --> 00:16:44,510
piece here can't get any close to

464
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:47,780
causation right like just because we say

465
00:16:44,510 --> 00:16:49,400
OMB was a three we can't then say well

466
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:51,470
because it was a three these actions

467
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:53,840
that the US government took earlier you

468
00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:55,340
know caused this to happen so but I like

469
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:56,890
one of the things I like about this is

470
00:16:55,340 --> 00:17:00,140
that the government's already doing it

471
00:16:56,890 --> 00:17:02,810
so it fits with an existing process

472
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:05,079
that's already run DHS and White House

473
00:17:02,810 --> 00:17:09,169
so this would be a very very easy way to

474
00:17:05,079 --> 00:17:10,849
do this at least for the government side

475
00:17:09,170 --> 00:17:13,940
it's not it's not as good for us but

476
00:17:10,849 --> 00:17:16,339
it's it's not bad for private sector the

477
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:19,400
second framework is based on that

478
00:17:16,339 --> 00:17:20,810
statement from the best mustache'

479
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:24,740
government

480
00:17:20,810 --> 00:17:26,720
is this one the hacking of opium of the

481
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:29,560
Chinese is exactly the kind of threat to

482
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:31,760
privacy that we're determined to deter

483
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:33,710
we keep you know a lot of us have issues

484
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:35,210
with the statement the opium was just

485
00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:37,220
espionage and we've said that that's

486
00:17:35,210 --> 00:17:40,040
okay but let's put that aside let's take

487
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:44,270
it this at mustache value or face value

488
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:47,120
so let's say if we wanted the term

489
00:17:44,270 --> 00:17:47,779
things like opium well let's figure out

490
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:48,709
what that means

491
00:17:47,779 --> 00:17:50,929
all right let's get a big bottle of

492
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:54,139
booze um I'm on I'm on a gin kick right

493
00:17:50,929 --> 00:17:55,399
now a big enough white board and then

494
00:17:54,139 --> 00:17:57,439
let's say all right what's an opium

495
00:17:55,399 --> 00:17:58,849
style incident right it's not gonna take

496
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:01,129
us that long to say well what are the

497
00:17:58,849 --> 00:18:04,129
characteristics of the things that we

498
00:18:01,129 --> 00:18:07,129
want adversaries to stop doing to us we

499
00:18:04,129 --> 00:18:08,988
include some in our paper as a start and

500
00:18:07,129 --> 00:18:10,309
we just look at all right well what past

501
00:18:08,989 --> 00:18:12,320
incidents have had those characteristics

502
00:18:10,309 --> 00:18:15,950
and then we track those in a time in a

503
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:17,928
time series with with the new incidents

504
00:18:15,950 --> 00:18:19,609
again this is this sounds ridiculously

505
00:18:17,929 --> 00:18:22,580
simple but from what we've been talking

506
00:18:19,609 --> 00:18:24,859
with around the community even the

507
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:28,849
simplest stuff isn't being done to the

508
00:18:24,859 --> 00:18:31,129
level that you'd think and what the

509
00:18:28,849 --> 00:18:34,039
persistent engagers and right what the

510
00:18:31,129 --> 00:18:37,029
the Hawks are saying is going to happen

511
00:18:34,039 --> 00:18:40,779
is something like the one on the left

512
00:18:37,029 --> 00:18:42,469
that we're going to be seeing a decrease

513
00:18:40,779 --> 00:18:44,509
now this hasn't really proven

514
00:18:42,469 --> 00:18:45,710
correlation or causation but this is

515
00:18:44,509 --> 00:18:48,080
what their thing is going to happen

516
00:18:45,710 --> 00:18:49,639
they're saying this might be the most

517
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:52,879
significant thing that we've ever done

518
00:18:49,639 --> 00:18:55,129
in our field of information security is

519
00:18:52,879 --> 00:18:56,599
the way it's being promised well what

520
00:18:55,129 --> 00:18:58,339
happens if that doesn't happen what if

521
00:18:56,599 --> 00:19:04,279
we get case to the one on the right and

522
00:18:58,339 --> 00:19:06,019
we see a sharp increase then we've got

523
00:19:04,279 --> 00:19:07,940
an issue right it's not proved neither

524
00:19:06,019 --> 00:19:12,919
one of these is proving it either way

525
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:14,570
but the evidence can be suggestive all

526
00:19:12,919 --> 00:19:15,979
right if they're saying this is gonna be

527
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:17,989
the best things ever and it's gonna go

528
00:19:15,979 --> 00:19:20,539
down and in fate in fact we see a sharp

529
00:19:17,989 --> 00:19:23,419
spike then the people that are in the

530
00:19:20,539 --> 00:19:25,190
Hawks they've got a case to explain all

531
00:19:23,419 --> 00:19:28,190
right they're going to come up and say

532
00:19:25,190 --> 00:19:30,649
to the policy makers why they think that

533
00:19:28,190 --> 00:19:33,019
happened in that since the failure of

534
00:19:30,649 --> 00:19:35,498
this would be much louder than a much

535
00:19:33,019 --> 00:19:38,839
stronger signal than the success of it

536
00:19:35,499 --> 00:19:41,239
so it's still some messy we can't get to

537
00:19:38,839 --> 00:19:43,009
correlation in causation

538
00:19:41,239 --> 00:19:44,389
we're only gonna be able to work with

539
00:19:43,009 --> 00:19:46,700
what's publicly known

540
00:19:44,389 --> 00:19:48,589
you know the large-scale disruptive

541
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:50,330
events the large-scale espionage after

542
00:19:48,589 --> 00:19:52,158
they've been discovered this isn't going

543
00:19:50,330 --> 00:19:53,629
to help us for all of the silents Arbour

544
00:19:52,159 --> 00:19:55,070
that were the incidents that we're not

545
00:19:53,629 --> 00:19:57,619
saying that that haven't become public

546
00:19:55,070 --> 00:19:58,879
yet but that's really gonna you know

547
00:19:57,619 --> 00:20:01,299
that we're gonna have that anyhow and

548
00:19:58,879 --> 00:20:03,219
most of these but it also does give more

549
00:20:01,299 --> 00:20:05,289
analytical transparency by laying out

550
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:07,840
what it is that we're counting we all

551
00:20:05,289 --> 00:20:08,919
can at least agree on on the direction

552
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:11,889
of the curve oh and that's what I want

553
00:20:08,919 --> 00:20:13,899
to say on this the actual count may be

554
00:20:11,889 --> 00:20:18,189
less important than the direction of the

555
00:20:13,899 --> 00:20:20,049
change alright if it's going down that's

556
00:20:18,190 --> 00:20:21,549
more important than how much or how much

557
00:20:20,049 --> 00:20:23,049
it how little it's going down which

558
00:20:21,549 --> 00:20:25,389
might be harder to count if it goes way

559
00:20:23,049 --> 00:20:28,809
up just that direction in magnitude can

560
00:20:25,389 --> 00:20:30,879
tell us a whole lot the third one that

561
00:20:28,809 --> 00:20:32,678
we want to talk about is doing a deep

562
00:20:30,879 --> 00:20:34,869
dive on a particular adversarial

563
00:20:32,679 --> 00:20:37,690
particular goal and so for us the red

564
00:20:34,869 --> 00:20:40,809
line drawn report is the best example of

565
00:20:37,690 --> 00:20:44,649
that of saying all right we specifically

566
00:20:40,809 --> 00:20:46,989
want to see commercial espionage go down

567
00:20:44,649 --> 00:20:49,149
my Chinese actors the other ones

568
00:20:46,989 --> 00:20:51,869
couldn't get into that specific level of

569
00:20:49,149 --> 00:20:55,119
adversary and motive and the type this

570
00:20:51,869 --> 00:20:56,830
specific policy goal we want Chinese

571
00:20:55,119 --> 00:20:59,580
commercial espionage going down well

572
00:20:56,830 --> 00:21:01,629
this was a specific measurement of that

573
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:03,158
and there were issues I mean there's

574
00:21:01,629 --> 00:21:04,509
still some argument over whether this

575
00:21:03,159 --> 00:21:06,700
was a success or not

576
00:21:04,509 --> 00:21:08,919
about this particular graph from the

577
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:11,169
fireEye report that's like if we're

578
00:21:08,919 --> 00:21:13,109
still arguing from this but four years

579
00:21:11,169 --> 00:21:14,830
after it came out what makes us think

580
00:21:13,109 --> 00:21:16,269
we're going to do much better on

581
00:21:14,830 --> 00:21:18,759
persistent engagement unless we do

582
00:21:16,269 --> 00:21:20,649
better now so regardless of whether you

583
00:21:18,759 --> 00:21:22,690
agreed with the with the results of that

584
00:21:20,649 --> 00:21:24,580
report or not there's three key

585
00:21:22,690 --> 00:21:26,529
questions that we got to focus on here

586
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:28,840
one was there an actual decrease in

587
00:21:26,529 --> 00:21:31,059
Chinese operations or not maybe they

588
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:34,299
just became more stealthy that's a

589
00:21:31,059 --> 00:21:37,928
question for cyber threat analysts the

590
00:21:34,299 --> 00:21:39,700
second question well maybe if it did go

591
00:21:37,929 --> 00:21:42,789
down it had nothing to do with art with

592
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:43,899
us I'm and this is our colleague Adam

593
00:21:42,789 --> 00:21:46,600
Siegel at the Council of Foreign

594
00:21:43,899 --> 00:21:48,158
Relations a China expert has said well

595
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:50,549
maybe the Chinese wanted to do that

596
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:53,739
because they saw this Hopf this as

597
00:21:50,549 --> 00:21:55,269
corruption and they wanted to centralize

598
00:21:53,739 --> 00:21:57,759
things anyhow because that's what she

599
00:21:55,269 --> 00:21:59,940
wants to do well then maybe our actions

600
00:21:57,759 --> 00:22:02,139
weren't successful unive it did go down

601
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:04,809
and that's a question best answered by

602
00:22:02,139 --> 00:22:08,289
the China experts I was like I was like

603
00:22:04,809 --> 00:22:10,090
Adam Siegel last is well did the

604
00:22:08,289 --> 00:22:11,950
decrease matter I've heard a lot of

605
00:22:10,090 --> 00:22:13,629
folks that were talking about that we're

606
00:22:11,950 --> 00:22:17,019
throwing stones at fire activist report

607
00:22:13,630 --> 00:22:19,059
said well yeah it went down 95 percent

608
00:22:17,019 --> 00:22:21,279
or something like that but that five

609
00:22:19,059 --> 00:22:23,559
percent might be really really important

610
00:22:21,279 --> 00:22:26,740
those must be the most critical networks

611
00:22:23,559 --> 00:22:28,510
and it needs to be zero because it

612
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:31,179
doesn't matter that it came down 95

613
00:22:28,510 --> 00:22:33,399
percent that's not ours to answer right

614
00:22:31,179 --> 00:22:34,899
that's up to the policymakers and for

615
00:22:33,399 --> 00:22:37,178
the others that are involved to answer

616
00:22:34,899 --> 00:22:39,158
whether or not that succeeded or not so

617
00:22:37,179 --> 00:22:41,139
we think there's a lot of value in this

618
00:22:39,159 --> 00:22:43,570
of going in for this adversary pairing

619
00:22:41,139 --> 00:22:45,330
and looking at the specific policy goal

620
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:48,158
that we want that we want to go forward

621
00:22:45,330 --> 00:22:50,110
but we need to take these questions in

622
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:53,679
so that we can be more transparent

623
00:22:50,110 --> 00:22:55,149
between us as analysts about what where

624
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:56,860
it is trying to what we're trying to get

625
00:22:55,149 --> 00:22:58,570
towards so we've got to do this we've

626
00:22:56,860 --> 00:23:00,370
got to do with transparency it's a lot

627
00:22:58,570 --> 00:23:02,649
less messy it's tied specifically to the

628
00:23:00,370 --> 00:23:04,600
policy goal but we're still it's gonna

629
00:23:02,649 --> 00:23:07,360
be still doing this hard it the specific

630
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:08,769
cause and effect so essentially those

631
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:11,320
are the three basic frameworks that we

632
00:23:08,769 --> 00:23:13,029
think that we can use and work with like

633
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:15,100
we said strengths and weaknesses to all

634
00:23:13,029 --> 00:23:17,230
of them but I think at least it gives

635
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:18,969
you a little bit of gives us a place to

636
00:23:17,230 --> 00:23:20,200
start right we can start playing with

637
00:23:18,970 --> 00:23:22,029
them we can start using them when you

638
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:23,649
start trying them out see what kind of

639
00:23:22,029 --> 00:23:26,889
results we get out of the other end and

640
00:23:23,649 --> 00:23:28,629
of course there are shortcomings so we

641
00:23:26,889 --> 00:23:29,830
we thought of these some of these

642
00:23:28,630 --> 00:23:31,720
shortcomings as we were doing the work

643
00:23:29,830 --> 00:23:34,029
are the people that we engage with raise

644
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:36,340
them as we talk to them and I think it's

645
00:23:34,029 --> 00:23:37,870
important to you know be clear and be

646
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:41,039
upfront about what the shortcomings of

647
00:23:37,870 --> 00:23:43,928
this stuff is of these documents are

648
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:47,110
it's very clear that what we're trying

649
00:23:43,929 --> 00:23:49,149
to measure here can be affected by lots

650
00:23:47,110 --> 00:23:52,090
of things that aren't at all related to

651
00:23:49,149 --> 00:23:54,549
what the US government Cybercom and the

652
00:23:52,090 --> 00:23:56,260
military are trying to do or by what

653
00:23:54,549 --> 00:23:59,289
some of the kind of defenders are trying

654
00:23:56,260 --> 00:24:01,149
to do on the network of inside so these

655
00:23:59,289 --> 00:24:02,649
the effects of the u.s. actions the u.s.

656
00:24:01,149 --> 00:24:03,580
actions are trying to u.s. comers trying

657
00:24:02,649 --> 00:24:06,189
to take they could be swamped by these

658
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:07,299
technical developments right if you we

659
00:24:06,190 --> 00:24:09,220
can have an increase in the number of

660
00:24:07,299 --> 00:24:10,809
reported in assists because all these

661
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:13,000
new classes of vulnerabilities get

662
00:24:10,809 --> 00:24:14,649
released or there's a flood of new and

663
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:17,049
insecure devices from the Internet of

664
00:24:14,649 --> 00:24:19,029
Things which of course there are or

665
00:24:17,049 --> 00:24:20,379
because we get better at detecting we

666
00:24:19,029 --> 00:24:21,639
get better defense so if we get better

667
00:24:20,379 --> 00:24:23,260
at detecting and get better at reporting

668
00:24:21,639 --> 00:24:25,549
incidents is going to look like they're

669
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:27,320
a lot more incidents that

670
00:24:25,549 --> 00:24:30,529
that can be confusing to this kind of

671
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:31,879
analysis it could also be that you know

672
00:24:30,529 --> 00:24:33,350
we could start deploying more secure

673
00:24:31,879 --> 00:24:35,090
infrastructure we can start doing better

674
00:24:33,350 --> 00:24:36,709
on the defensive side and that's gonna

675
00:24:35,090 --> 00:24:39,379
actually end up leading to fewer attacks

676
00:24:36,710 --> 00:24:41,149
that's gonna drive the adversaries in

677
00:24:39,379 --> 00:24:42,469
different ways but it's gonna kind of

678
00:24:41,149 --> 00:24:43,998
affect what we think of as the

679
00:24:42,470 --> 00:24:45,139
measurement here right so one of the

680
00:24:43,999 --> 00:24:46,759
things we could do to kind of control

681
00:24:45,139 --> 00:24:48,860
for that is to check these competing

682
00:24:46,759 --> 00:24:51,019
hypotheses by comparing the trend lines

683
00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:52,488
between the adversaries like look at the

684
00:24:51,019 --> 00:24:53,929
trend line of what's happening with run

685
00:24:52,489 --> 00:24:55,669
look at a trend line of what's happening

686
00:24:53,929 --> 00:24:56,929
with China if they're moving in opposite

687
00:24:55,669 --> 00:24:58,909
directions and it's probably not a

688
00:24:56,929 --> 00:25:03,169
global effect that's causing that that

689
00:24:58,909 --> 00:25:04,970
change you could also be that you know

690
00:25:03,169 --> 00:25:06,440
many of these attacks and the adversary

691
00:25:04,970 --> 00:25:07,970
motivations are hidden the data's gonna

692
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:10,580
be hard to come by and analyze I think

693
00:25:07,970 --> 00:25:12,470
any of you that work for a cyber

694
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:14,149
security vendor know how difficult it

695
00:25:12,470 --> 00:25:15,379
can be sometimes to find this data to

696
00:25:14,149 --> 00:25:16,639
know what you have and know what

697
00:25:15,379 --> 00:25:19,009
everybody else has put all that stuff

698
00:25:16,639 --> 00:25:20,869
together it could also be the

699
00:25:19,009 --> 00:25:22,639
geopolitical events caused adversaries

700
00:25:20,869 --> 00:25:25,428
to change what they're doing right it

701
00:25:22,639 --> 00:25:28,100
could become some kind of pressure on a

702
00:25:25,429 --> 00:25:29,389
government that causes them to say well

703
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:31,309
either that pressures gonna cause them

704
00:25:29,389 --> 00:25:32,809
either decrease the amount of cyber

705
00:25:31,309 --> 00:25:33,950
incidents they're doing or increase the

706
00:25:32,809 --> 00:25:37,158
amount of cyber instances they're doing

707
00:25:33,950 --> 00:25:40,960
right this is all a complex situation of

708
00:25:37,159 --> 00:25:43,580
cost and benefit that's gonna impact the

709
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:46,009
focuses decision-making so how do we

710
00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:47,629
control for that well we can just need

711
00:25:46,009 --> 00:25:49,759
to understand that having the exact

712
00:25:47,629 --> 00:25:51,799
numeration of what's happening in each

713
00:25:49,759 --> 00:25:54,440
of those categories matters less than

714
00:25:51,799 --> 00:25:56,570
the direction like Jay said so if we're

715
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:58,909
looking for direction especially that

716
00:25:56,570 --> 00:26:01,399
upward trend if we're seeing an upward

717
00:25:58,909 --> 00:26:05,269
trend that should send off alarm signals

718
00:26:01,399 --> 00:26:06,289
for the persistent engagers and finally

719
00:26:05,269 --> 00:26:09,320
there's you know some methodological

720
00:26:06,289 --> 00:26:11,330
factors gonna hinder this time scale

721
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:12,950
right like how often are we talking

722
00:26:11,330 --> 00:26:16,070
about a cyber incident that was just

723
00:26:12,950 --> 00:26:18,499
discovered that actually began two years

724
00:26:16,070 --> 00:26:21,049
ago right it's gonna be very hard to

725
00:26:18,499 --> 00:26:23,480
either disentangle that from a

726
00:26:21,049 --> 00:26:26,658
government action or to look at it in

727
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:30,169
three years and say the action is the US

728
00:26:26,659 --> 00:26:32,419
government we're taking in 2019 you know

729
00:26:30,169 --> 00:26:35,539
we're having these effects when we can't

730
00:26:32,419 --> 00:26:37,340
always catch and find the incidents at

731
00:26:35,539 --> 00:26:38,260
the same time and then you also have

732
00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:39,639
like the the

733
00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:40,809
problem with small numbers right if

734
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:41,710
we're only looking at the significant

735
00:26:40,809 --> 00:26:43,600
instance we're only talking about

736
00:26:41,710 --> 00:26:45,160
significant incidents and you have two

737
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:46,689
of them and you have to the next year

738
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:49,330
that's an increasing 100 percent that

739
00:26:46,690 --> 00:26:50,830
looks like a lot right so you have to be

740
00:26:49,330 --> 00:26:53,770
very careful with the decision making

741
00:26:50,830 --> 00:26:55,780
the way we do these so what do we what

742
00:26:53,770 --> 00:26:57,190
do we need to do well we can you know

743
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:58,809
try to appropriately structure the

744
00:26:57,190 --> 00:27:00,070
framework we can try to code the data a

745
00:26:58,809 --> 00:27:01,899
little better to make sure that doesn't

746
00:27:00,070 --> 00:27:04,570
happen or release it if it does happen

747
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:06,820
we understand it and then of course the

748
00:27:04,570 --> 00:27:09,040
other one is to just give up and not try

749
00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:10,450
to measure it at all because no strategy

750
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:12,940
can have any kind of measurable effect

751
00:27:10,450 --> 00:27:14,500
but I think it's worthwhile trying yeah

752
00:27:12,940 --> 00:27:16,510
if I can jump on that last one one of

753
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:19,750
the things I get to do is I get to give

754
00:27:16,510 --> 00:27:20,950
a twice a year there's a group of

755
00:27:19,750 --> 00:27:23,559
generals that get together one of the

756
00:27:20,950 --> 00:27:25,929
Air Force bases and they just get two

757
00:27:23,559 --> 00:27:27,790
days kind of academic atmosphere to

758
00:27:25,929 --> 00:27:29,290
learn more about cyber and I get to give

759
00:27:27,790 --> 00:27:31,990
a version of this talk down there and

760
00:27:29,290 --> 00:27:33,040
had this Air Force you start saying yeah

761
00:27:31,990 --> 00:27:34,809
you're not gonna be able to measure this

762
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:36,580
at all this is just impossible why even

763
00:27:34,809 --> 00:27:38,350
trying to measure it I'm like dude it's

764
00:27:36,580 --> 00:27:41,020
not my strategy right is is your

765
00:27:38,350 --> 00:27:43,030
strategy right if this is the question

766
00:27:41,020 --> 00:27:44,740
for general NACA Sony not for me right

767
00:27:43,030 --> 00:27:47,110
if you think if you didn't all think

768
00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:50,770
this is so hard to measure then why are

769
00:27:47,110 --> 00:27:53,530
you then why are the four stars and the

770
00:27:50,770 --> 00:27:55,840
John Bolton's of the world being so sure

771
00:27:53,530 --> 00:27:57,879
that this is going to work when the

772
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:59,439
measurement of success and failure is

773
00:27:57,880 --> 00:28:01,330
going to be so chaotic and so difficult

774
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:03,100
and of course we don't think it's worth

775
00:28:01,330 --> 00:28:05,260
giving up we think you can you can do a

776
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:07,030
good good set of work on it so what

777
00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:10,870
we've talked about so far is what is in

778
00:28:07,030 --> 00:28:13,090
the paper that that came out it's a I

779
00:28:10,870 --> 00:28:16,030
Triple E we wanted to say all right

780
00:28:13,090 --> 00:28:19,928
let's dive in unless what's our next

781
00:28:16,030 --> 00:28:21,220
work gonna be and so one is I don't know

782
00:28:19,929 --> 00:28:24,340
if we'll do this but I think it would be

783
00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:26,350
a good good paper for our folks at folks

784
00:28:24,340 --> 00:28:28,689
at five point to say all right so what

785
00:28:26,350 --> 00:28:31,240
can we learn four kinds of conflict that

786
00:28:28,690 --> 00:28:33,970
are similar to this where the

787
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:35,590
adversaries are in constant contact and

788
00:28:33,970 --> 00:28:38,980
what can we learn from that for example

789
00:28:35,590 --> 00:28:41,199
I sub marine warfare espionage during

790
00:28:38,980 --> 00:28:43,030
the Cold War we would fly bombers at the

791
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:45,040
Soviet Union and play bombers at us we'd

792
00:28:43,030 --> 00:28:46,960
be specifically trying to look

793
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:48,190
aggressive so they light up their radar

794
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:50,340
so that we could learn about what they

795
00:28:48,190 --> 00:28:52,540
were going to be like so you had this

796
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:55,030
belligerents between participants over

797
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:56,230
long periods of time and I think there's

798
00:28:55,030 --> 00:28:58,809
something that week that we can learn

799
00:28:56,230 --> 00:29:00,880
from that but where we really want to be

800
00:28:58,809 --> 00:29:02,830
doing our work over the next year is

801
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:05,140
saying all right if we want to try and

802
00:29:02,830 --> 00:29:07,418
figure out what the impact disruptive

803
00:29:05,140 --> 00:29:09,429
operations are going to be let's look at

804
00:29:07,419 --> 00:29:12,400
past disruptive operations and pull

805
00:29:09,429 --> 00:29:19,690
those lessons out now this is gonna be a

806
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:21,640
Lillis trait if only so so what do we

807
00:29:19,690 --> 00:29:22,900
what do we do from this perspective well

808
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:24,640
I think there's a couple of different

809
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:27,100
ways that we can try to tackle it

810
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:29,110
there's a harder version where we built

811
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:31,030
back for like causal hypothesis of what

812
00:29:29,110 --> 00:29:33,729
makes some of these disruptive actions

813
00:29:31,030 --> 00:29:36,309
that Network defenders or the federal

814
00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:38,049
government can take what makes those

815
00:29:36,309 --> 00:29:40,840
actions more successful against certain

816
00:29:38,049 --> 00:29:43,059
adversary groups in certain operations

817
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:44,740
or a little slightly more modest no it

818
00:29:43,059 --> 00:29:46,330
just lets we can study those past

819
00:29:44,740 --> 00:29:48,700
disruptive that operations that have

820
00:29:46,330 --> 00:29:50,439
happened look at that as a guide in the

821
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:52,600
future is what to expect and some of the

822
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:53,830
kind of sets some upper bounds on what

823
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:55,059
to expect from some of the persistent

824
00:29:53,830 --> 00:29:58,780
engagement and then forwarding

825
00:29:55,059 --> 00:30:00,970
operations so kind of from a broad

826
00:29:58,780 --> 00:30:02,830
analytical assessment how do we want to

827
00:30:00,970 --> 00:30:04,809
put you know we're how do we want to

828
00:30:02,830 --> 00:30:06,549
categorize these things so we're talking

829
00:30:04,809 --> 00:30:09,399
about some of these disruption actions

830
00:30:06,549 --> 00:30:11,650
we can look at them from how you know

831
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:13,450
kind of passives they are to how active

832
00:30:11,650 --> 00:30:16,179
they are and what we mean by passive at

833
00:30:13,450 --> 00:30:18,460
least kind of in our first first draft

834
00:30:16,179 --> 00:30:20,410
thinking about this are kind of what are

835
00:30:18,460 --> 00:30:23,230
the actions that network defenders take

836
00:30:20,410 --> 00:30:26,770
on a normal basis right when a cyber

837
00:30:23,230 --> 00:30:29,140
security company like Talos or Symantec

838
00:30:26,770 --> 00:30:30,879
or a fire I put out a report that's got

839
00:30:29,140 --> 00:30:32,950
a bunch of indicators and explain what

840
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:35,290
an adversary group is doing what kind of

841
00:30:32,950 --> 00:30:37,210
effect does that have right it's out in

842
00:30:35,290 --> 00:30:39,280
the environment it's available for

843
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:40,870
people to leverage it's available for

844
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:42,549
cybersecurity vendors to put into their

845
00:30:40,870 --> 00:30:45,668
systems and protect their customers it's

846
00:30:42,549 --> 00:30:47,590
available for some owners and operators

847
00:30:45,669 --> 00:30:50,650
of systems to take those indicators put

848
00:30:47,590 --> 00:30:52,570
them in themselves that mean that that

849
00:30:50,650 --> 00:30:53,679
kind of has a very passive role right

850
00:30:52,570 --> 00:30:54,909
like you're you're putting information

851
00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:56,710
out there and then you're waiting for

852
00:30:54,910 --> 00:30:58,480
others to take it and do stuff with it

853
00:30:56,710 --> 00:31:01,030
all the way up to the active end of the

854
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:03,429
spectrum right so actually going after

855
00:31:01,030 --> 00:31:05,168
the adversary groups through

856
00:31:03,429 --> 00:31:07,450
an offensive cyber counter counter

857
00:31:05,169 --> 00:31:09,159
offensive cyber operation may be an

858
00:31:07,450 --> 00:31:10,419
indictment maybe the US government

859
00:31:09,159 --> 00:31:13,659
sanctions them you know that kind of

860
00:31:10,419 --> 00:31:15,850
more more active activity you also want

861
00:31:13,659 --> 00:31:17,860
to get a look at the kinds of disruption

862
00:31:15,850 --> 00:31:20,379
is it just have a minor effect on the

863
00:31:17,860 --> 00:31:22,330
adversary or a big effect and how often

864
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:24,539
are you doing it was it a one-off drop

865
00:31:22,330 --> 00:31:26,678
of information or the kind of a steady

866
00:31:24,539 --> 00:31:28,750
drip of information or is it something

867
00:31:26,679 --> 00:31:31,450
to sustain and happening over a period

868
00:31:28,750 --> 00:31:33,159
of time we also want to look at the

869
00:31:31,450 --> 00:31:36,010
duration of the disruption right how

870
00:31:33,159 --> 00:31:38,409
often or how for how long was the

871
00:31:36,010 --> 00:31:39,940
adversary group disruptive how long does

872
00:31:38,409 --> 00:31:41,650
it take them to return to their initial

873
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:43,150
operation and if initial operating

874
00:31:41,650 --> 00:31:45,490
capability or their full operating

875
00:31:43,150 --> 00:31:47,530
capability it take days two weeks most

876
00:31:45,490 --> 00:31:49,570
years that kind of thing that's a and

877
00:31:47,530 --> 00:31:51,820
then what were the potential reasons for

878
00:31:49,570 --> 00:31:54,460
the delay right where the was the delay

879
00:31:51,820 --> 00:31:55,928
in getting back up to FOC because they

880
00:31:54,460 --> 00:31:58,150
had technical issues right do they have

881
00:31:55,929 --> 00:31:59,650
to go back and reestablish their

882
00:31:58,150 --> 00:32:01,870
infrastructure did they have to go by

883
00:31:59,650 --> 00:32:03,850
new IP addresses did they have to

884
00:32:01,870 --> 00:32:05,199
rebuild their malware from scratch and

885
00:32:03,850 --> 00:32:07,389
that's why it took them so long to get

886
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:09,640
back up or was it some kind of

887
00:32:07,390 --> 00:32:12,669
combination of behavioral bureaucratic

888
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:14,830
or political things right did from the

889
00:32:12,669 --> 00:32:16,390
political spectrum was the government

890
00:32:14,830 --> 00:32:18,730
that was endorsing this activity

891
00:32:16,390 --> 00:32:22,090
embarrassed massively and so they said

892
00:32:18,730 --> 00:32:23,500
our he stopped like my my intelligence

893
00:32:22,090 --> 00:32:25,330
collection group I want you to stop

894
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:26,530
doing what you're doing and don't do it

895
00:32:25,330 --> 00:32:27,610
again for six months right like that

896
00:32:26,530 --> 00:32:28,750
doesn't have anything to do with the

897
00:32:27,610 --> 00:32:30,428
technical side they could have just

898
00:32:28,750 --> 00:32:32,559
flipped some switches switch over some

899
00:32:30,429 --> 00:32:34,090
infrastructure gotten back on but they

900
00:32:32,559 --> 00:32:38,678
were told by their political leadership

901
00:32:34,090 --> 00:32:41,559
don't do this anymore so so we want to

902
00:32:38,679 --> 00:32:44,470
look at a couple of different frameworks

903
00:32:41,559 --> 00:32:45,970
for these types of incidents so in this

904
00:32:44,470 --> 00:32:47,799
talk we'll talk a little bit about some

905
00:32:45,970 --> 00:32:49,600
you know possible uses of these case

906
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:51,639
studies around adversary and campaign

907
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:53,408
groups and malware and ransomware well

908
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:55,179
we can also do this for botnets we could

909
00:32:53,409 --> 00:32:58,900
do this for DDoS campaigns as well

910
00:32:55,179 --> 00:33:03,820
so one a one needless Austral examples

911
00:32:58,900 --> 00:33:06,280
is the oil rig group so recently someone

912
00:33:03,820 --> 00:33:08,889
they're not entirely clear who if it was

913
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:10,960
an insider if it was a government if it

914
00:33:08,890 --> 00:33:13,030
was some group of network defenders or

915
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:14,740
just you know somebody who found this

916
00:33:13,030 --> 00:33:18,550
stuff and wanted to out it

917
00:33:14,740 --> 00:33:21,010
someone got oil rigs toolset put it out

918
00:33:18,550 --> 00:33:22,090
there for everybody to see exposed all

919
00:33:21,010 --> 00:33:23,770
of their tools all of their

920
00:33:22,090 --> 00:33:27,840
infrastructure we made it publicly

921
00:33:23,770 --> 00:33:30,340
available that was a pretty big massive

922
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:32,459
event that happened to the oil rig group

923
00:33:30,340 --> 00:33:36,060
right I give everything you have in your

924
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:38,410
and your toolset is suddenly exposed

925
00:33:36,060 --> 00:33:40,360
what are you gonna do about it or how do

926
00:33:38,410 --> 00:33:44,260
you how do you react to that

927
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:46,360
so what we saw in reality was a pretty

928
00:33:44,260 --> 00:33:48,220
significant disruption that happened to

929
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:50,379
them but it was you know kind of on the

930
00:33:48,220 --> 00:33:52,930
timescale of weeks to months right they

931
00:33:50,380 --> 00:33:54,340
got outed all of their stuff got outed

932
00:33:52,930 --> 00:33:56,200
they went quiet for a while but we

933
00:33:54,340 --> 00:33:57,790
started to see them come back we started

934
00:33:56,200 --> 00:34:00,430
to see them take some different actions

935
00:33:57,790 --> 00:34:02,740
and do some different things they may

936
00:34:00,430 --> 00:34:04,450
not be back to full capability yet but

937
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:06,880
this kind of framework can help us at

938
00:34:04,450 --> 00:34:09,220
least put some bounds on that yeah and

939
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:10,870
so I already got just so comprehensively

940
00:34:09,219 --> 00:34:13,959
screwed right everything they had was

941
00:34:10,870 --> 00:34:16,359
out if they come back in three months

942
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:18,070
that gives us an upper limit of what we

943
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:20,080
can expect from cyber command disruption

944
00:34:18,070 --> 00:34:20,980
operations right if you hit someone that

945
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:24,100
comprehensively

946
00:34:20,980 --> 00:34:26,830
and it only slows them down for a little

947
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:28,239
for a single quarter well then we

948
00:34:26,830 --> 00:34:30,699
shouldn't be expecting that much of

949
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:32,290
persistent engagement but if rather they

950
00:34:30,699 --> 00:34:34,149
just disband like you know they just

951
00:34:32,290 --> 00:34:35,650
kind of stopped our operations and they

952
00:34:34,150 --> 00:34:38,410
just do and they just go off and do

953
00:34:35,650 --> 00:34:41,440
other things or you know they just go

954
00:34:38,409 --> 00:34:42,639
off into different groups then that

955
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:44,139
might teach us something that might

956
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:45,969
teach us something different all right

957
00:34:44,139 --> 00:34:47,500
if you really hit them hard and by the

958
00:34:45,969 --> 00:34:49,509
way shout out to Ken wealth of Standard

959
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:50,980
Chartered that gave us this example and

960
00:34:49,510 --> 00:34:55,750
really helped us think through this part

961
00:34:50,980 --> 00:34:58,780
this part of this this research apt one

962
00:34:55,750 --> 00:35:00,220
is another example right and this is

963
00:34:58,780 --> 00:35:01,690
what we this you think we have these

964
00:35:00,220 --> 00:35:03,279
natural experiments right we can look at

965
00:35:01,690 --> 00:35:05,530
these different disruption operations

966
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:07,000
and and hopefully there's enough of them

967
00:35:05,530 --> 00:35:10,600
that we can really take lessons out with

968
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:12,550
them you know apt one was significant it

969
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:16,110
was periodic right there was stuff

970
00:35:12,550 --> 00:35:18,730
coming out on apt one not just the

971
00:35:16,110 --> 00:35:20,710
mandiant report right that was a that

972
00:35:18,730 --> 00:35:22,360
was a significant one-off but there was

973
00:35:20,710 --> 00:35:24,070
a lot of other disruption operations

974
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:26,980
including active disruption operations

975
00:35:24,070 --> 00:35:28,620
that were happening across time what was

976
00:35:26,980 --> 00:35:30,240
happening to apt one

977
00:35:28,620 --> 00:35:32,100
and you did see a disruption of months

978
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:33,120
right folks were saying from a sign

979
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:34,380
anywhere from six months to a year

980
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:37,170
depending on and on what they were

981
00:35:34,380 --> 00:35:40,080
trying to count of how long apt one was

982
00:35:37,170 --> 00:35:42,390
down before they came back now some of

983
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:44,310
that was pot was was certainly due to

984
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:46,049
the technical factors right of just

985
00:35:44,310 --> 00:35:48,750
getting the infrastructure burnt of just

986
00:35:46,050 --> 00:35:51,540
having all their IOC s that were out

987
00:35:48,750 --> 00:35:53,730
there and widely widely shared on the

988
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:55,710
front time to the New York front page of

989
00:35:53,730 --> 00:35:57,540
the New York Times but clearly it seemed

990
00:35:55,710 --> 00:36:00,990
like there was political or bureaucratic

991
00:35:57,540 --> 00:36:02,670
reasons for this also feeling burned not

992
00:36:00,990 --> 00:36:03,859
wanting to have them come back out they

993
00:36:02,670 --> 00:36:06,240
probably could have come back

994
00:36:03,860 --> 00:36:08,160
technically a lot more quickly than they

995
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:10,080
did and so that's why we have this

996
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:12,870
factor of the of these non-technical

997
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:14,670
reasons to help us pull out to help us

998
00:36:12,870 --> 00:36:16,589
understand that we're not always going

999
00:36:14,670 --> 00:36:17,910
to know it but when we do have it we

1000
00:36:16,590 --> 00:36:20,490
think it's a good factor to happen

1001
00:36:17,910 --> 00:36:22,109
therefore modification looking at now

1002
00:36:20,490 --> 00:36:23,609
where and by the way these are just

1003
00:36:22,110 --> 00:36:25,320
illustrative if you don't agree

1004
00:36:23,610 --> 00:36:27,420
necessary with the conclusions and the

1005
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:28,800
way that we've categorized it we just

1006
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:30,780
want to have this material for blackhat

1007
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:33,240
we'll be doing more of the research over

1008
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:35,640
the coming year a configur was our

1009
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:38,220
exemplar for malware but you had this

1010
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:40,410
very active disruption operation that

1011
00:36:38,220 --> 00:36:43,220
was going on three years of the

1012
00:36:40,410 --> 00:36:45,720
configure working group her in this 2011

1013
00:36:43,220 --> 00:36:49,100
where they were doing everything they

1014
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:52,350
could to stop to stop and pick her from

1015
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:53,970
from spreading any farther but each time

1016
00:36:52,350 --> 00:36:56,580
they do this really significant

1017
00:36:53,970 --> 00:36:58,859
operation to find it it really only took

1018
00:36:56,580 --> 00:37:01,200
weeks for the authors of configure we

1019
00:36:58,860 --> 00:37:03,390
still don't know who they were to

1020
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:05,779
respond to that come out with another

1021
00:37:03,390 --> 00:37:09,839
version of configure that would bypass

1022
00:37:05,780 --> 00:37:11,640
those defensive mitigations so here they

1023
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:13,500
were doing this technical disruption and

1024
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:15,600
there was just no delay from the other

1025
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:17,340
side that seemed due to behavioral

1026
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:19,500
political or beer or bureaucratic

1027
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:22,260
reasons they were coming back quickly

1028
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:23,880
each and every time so our timeline for

1029
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:26,430
this for this work we're really

1030
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:28,380
enthusiastic for this part because as

1031
00:37:26,430 --> 00:37:30,180
far as we know there hasn't been any

1032
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:32,250
kind of general model for looking at

1033
00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:33,899
these disruptive operations and then

1034
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:35,640
just seeing what's been effective and

1035
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:37,170
what hasn't for how long and trying to

1036
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:39,480
come up with some reasons so we're gonna

1037
00:37:37,170 --> 00:37:40,930
be doing this hopefully presenting a

1038
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:43,570
cyber work on

1039
00:37:40,930 --> 00:37:46,930
which is going to be in November in the

1040
00:37:43,570 --> 00:37:48,670
Washington DC area to develop out these

1041
00:37:46,930 --> 00:37:50,710
categories and in some of these cases

1042
00:37:48,670 --> 00:37:52,360
also at Columbia University we have a

1043
00:37:50,710 --> 00:37:55,000
capstone program where the students do

1044
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:58,510
research and we're hoping that this is

1045
00:37:55,000 --> 00:38:00,160
going to be one that we do with four

1046
00:37:58,510 --> 00:38:02,680
capstone so we have some of the students

1047
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:04,779
get in and develop these out and we'll

1048
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:06,850
have that as a separate report and we'll

1049
00:38:04,780 --> 00:38:11,560
hopefully do it as a another psych on

1050
00:38:06,850 --> 00:38:13,450
paper coming out next summer and so as a

1051
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:15,070
you know I think we wanted to end today

1052
00:38:13,450 --> 00:38:18,040
with a call to action because a lot of

1053
00:38:15,070 --> 00:38:19,510
what we're doing here is just proposing

1054
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:23,110
some frameworks and then we want people

1055
00:38:19,510 --> 00:38:24,550
to start using them so if you are one of

1056
00:38:23,110 --> 00:38:27,610
these folks who believes that this new

1057
00:38:24,550 --> 00:38:28,960
offensive posture is going to make it

1058
00:38:27,610 --> 00:38:30,460
more difficult especially if you're a

1059
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:32,110
network defender especially if you're

1060
00:38:30,460 --> 00:38:34,420
someone who works at a cybersecurity

1061
00:38:32,110 --> 00:38:36,490
vendor if you think that this posture is

1062
00:38:34,420 --> 00:38:38,320
gonna make it harder for you to defend

1063
00:38:36,490 --> 00:38:40,629
the people that you are being paid to

1064
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:42,280
defend then let us know let the

1065
00:38:40,630 --> 00:38:43,660
community know right you should be

1066
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:45,190
talking about it you should be blogging

1067
00:38:43,660 --> 00:38:47,799
about it should be tweeting about it and

1068
00:38:45,190 --> 00:38:49,180
the really key part is if you should

1069
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:50,800
include some data along with your

1070
00:38:49,180 --> 00:38:52,569
opinion then policymakers are more

1071
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:53,980
likely to listen to you that's something

1072
00:38:52,570 --> 00:38:55,410
that I learned when my time in

1073
00:38:53,980 --> 00:38:58,300
government I think is something that

1074
00:38:55,410 --> 00:39:00,580
anyone can learn it has to talk to and

1075
00:38:58,300 --> 00:39:04,420
brief up and drive things for it like an

1076
00:39:00,580 --> 00:39:06,670
executive level audience so so you do

1077
00:39:04,420 --> 00:39:08,620
something how can the network defense

1078
00:39:06,670 --> 00:39:10,330
community help you can help us pick the

1079
00:39:08,620 --> 00:39:12,100
best framework she can help develop them

1080
00:39:10,330 --> 00:39:14,259
you can most importantly use them and

1081
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:15,759
the more folks are using them the more

1082
00:39:14,260 --> 00:39:17,920
we can try them out and more we can see

1083
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:19,420
what needs to be fixed share your

1084
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:21,490
results openly with the community

1085
00:39:19,420 --> 00:39:23,350
whether it's in a trust group or you

1086
00:39:21,490 --> 00:39:25,629
know I think preferably publicly blog

1087
00:39:23,350 --> 00:39:27,970
about it if you can via blogs reports

1088
00:39:25,630 --> 00:39:30,910
that kind of thing but the key part here

1089
00:39:27,970 --> 00:39:32,980
is we don't start measuring now we'll

1090
00:39:30,910 --> 00:39:34,569
just be that much further behind when we

1091
00:39:32,980 --> 00:39:37,540
need to really kind of have some

1092
00:39:34,570 --> 00:39:39,390
evidence to show some policymakers and

1093
00:39:37,540 --> 00:39:41,740
some executives that you know this

1094
00:39:39,390 --> 00:39:46,330
here's what's actually happening as an

1095
00:39:41,740 --> 00:39:47,620
outcome of your work and and so on a lot

1096
00:39:46,330 --> 00:39:49,390
of the reasons that we've been

1097
00:39:47,620 --> 00:39:51,220
disagreeing over the past disagreement

1098
00:39:49,390 --> 00:39:53,020
is great that we should be disagreeing

1099
00:39:51,220 --> 00:39:54,279
but what's bothering me is we haven't

1100
00:39:53,020 --> 00:39:55,960
been transparent and

1101
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:57,160
about where the disagreements are and

1102
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:58,510
that's what we're trying to do with the

1103
00:39:57,160 --> 00:40:01,330
frame right right we're trying to make

1104
00:39:58,510 --> 00:40:03,910
clear why you think what you think and

1105
00:40:01,330 --> 00:40:06,490
why I think what I think what evidence

1106
00:40:03,910 --> 00:40:08,529
helped get me to this point and if we

1107
00:40:06,490 --> 00:40:10,209
can be more transparent then we have a

1108
00:40:08,530 --> 00:40:12,040
better chance of being able to find the

1109
00:40:10,210 --> 00:40:13,300
truth I was gonna save convincing each

1110
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:16,300
other but convincing each other isn't

1111
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:18,610
necessarily the issue it I wouldn't even

1112
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:21,310
say truth trying to be more correct than

1113
00:40:18,610 --> 00:40:23,800
we are and that we happen and if we can

1114
00:40:21,310 --> 00:40:26,799
try and be more correct by showing our

1115
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:29,800
evidence by showing our work then we'll

1116
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:32,080
be a lot better off because this is

1117
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:34,030
really the potentially really dangerous

1118
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:36,700
the distraction we're going in

1119
00:40:34,030 --> 00:40:38,560
alright we're saying that the way to get

1120
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:40,810
peace the way to ensure that the

1121
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:43,509
Internet is going to be secure is by

1122
00:40:40,810 --> 00:40:45,970
getting engaged in a never-ending fight

1123
00:40:43,510 --> 00:40:48,220
with the uniformed military services of

1124
00:40:45,970 --> 00:40:49,959
nuclear-armed powers all right the time

1125
00:40:48,220 --> 00:40:52,990
for opinion is what we think is going to

1126
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:55,060
work or not work that's passed right we

1127
00:40:52,990 --> 00:40:57,609
now need to get in as a community in

1128
00:40:55,060 --> 00:40:59,440
saying all right let's be transparent

1129
00:40:57,610 --> 00:41:01,750
and let's really try and figure out this

1130
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:02,980
is helping or not because right now

1131
00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:05,800
we're letting the government grade its

1132
00:41:02,980 --> 00:41:07,660
own homework and that's not that's not

1133
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:09,340
right that's not why we're doing things

1134
00:41:07,660 --> 00:41:10,569
like blackhat because where you say you

1135
00:41:09,340 --> 00:41:12,010
know let's just trust the government in

1136
00:41:10,570 --> 00:41:17,910
their classified sources to figure that

1137
00:41:12,010 --> 00:41:17,910
figure this out so with that thank you

1138
00:41:23,100 --> 00:41:27,810
any questions we've got microphones or I

1139
00:41:33,510 --> 00:41:38,230
whenever I read anything with defending

1140
00:41:35,860 --> 00:41:39,850
forward one of the the biggest concerns

1141
00:41:38,230 --> 00:41:42,550
I always have is the attribution problem

1142
00:41:39,850 --> 00:41:44,950
right if someone shoots a scud missile

1143
00:41:42,550 --> 00:41:47,530
at you it's usually pretty easy a to

1144
00:41:44,950 --> 00:41:49,060
figure out who shot it and B whether or

1145
00:41:47,530 --> 00:41:50,200
not they're operating under the

1146
00:41:49,060 --> 00:41:52,180
authorization of their command and

1147
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:54,189
control structure and neither of those

1148
00:41:52,180 --> 00:41:57,390
things are true in cyber necessarily

1149
00:41:54,190 --> 00:42:00,730
like it'd be pretty trivial for the GRU

1150
00:41:57,390 --> 00:42:02,319
to comp compromised the Chinese

1151
00:42:00,730 --> 00:42:04,930
infrastructure and use that to launch

1152
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:05,519
operations against the United States to

1153
00:42:04,930 --> 00:42:08,788
trigger the

1154
00:42:05,519 --> 00:42:10,249
States to go after China right so how do

1155
00:42:08,789 --> 00:42:12,749
you I'm wondering how you're gonna

1156
00:42:10,249 --> 00:42:15,948
factor attribution into this framework

1157
00:42:12,749 --> 00:42:18,328
yeah I think that's more important for

1158
00:42:15,949 --> 00:42:19,529
the Cyber Command folks is they're doing

1159
00:42:18,329 --> 00:42:22,529
the operations to make sure they're

1160
00:42:19,529 --> 00:42:23,909
factoring that in so I have long that

1161
00:42:22,529 --> 00:42:26,009
good continuity right they've been

1162
00:42:23,909 --> 00:42:27,919
watching them for a while because this

1163
00:42:26,009 --> 00:42:29,999
isn't I don't consider this hack back

1164
00:42:27,919 --> 00:42:31,589
right they're not saying you're gonna

1165
00:42:29,999 --> 00:42:32,879
hit us we're gonna hit you they're

1166
00:42:31,589 --> 00:42:35,219
saying we're gonna get into your

1167
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:38,039
infrastructure and if we are following

1168
00:42:35,219 --> 00:42:39,839
this GRU target and they are pivoting

1169
00:42:38,039 --> 00:42:43,019
from a system in Turkey to a system in

1170
00:42:39,839 --> 00:42:44,549
the Netherlands that they now have the

1171
00:42:43,019 --> 00:42:46,439
authority to follow the Russians into

1172
00:42:44,549 --> 00:42:48,509
that system in the Netherlands and then

1173
00:42:46,439 --> 00:42:50,848
when it's the right time we lock them

1174
00:42:48,509 --> 00:42:53,039
out of their malware or we do a takedown

1175
00:42:50,849 --> 00:42:56,309
in the command and control so for them

1176
00:42:53,039 --> 00:42:58,409
the attribution is less important from

1177
00:42:56,309 --> 00:43:01,049
that for that kind of operation because

1178
00:42:58,409 --> 00:43:02,849
they're directly seeing the malware so

1179
00:43:01,049 --> 00:43:04,229
for those ones that are on that like the

1180
00:43:02,849 --> 00:43:06,269
lower numbers when I was giving that one

1181
00:43:04,229 --> 00:43:08,009
through 10 like of just causing friction

1182
00:43:06,269 --> 00:43:09,479
hey whether we're causing correction to

1183
00:43:08,009 --> 00:43:13,589
the Russians the Chinese doesn't matter

1184
00:43:09,479 --> 00:43:14,999
that much and for some of these

1185
00:43:13,589 --> 00:43:16,619
measurement frameworks it also doesn't

1186
00:43:14,999 --> 00:43:17,968
matter either way we do the takedown and

1187
00:43:16,619 --> 00:43:19,589
theoretically the number is gonna be

1188
00:43:17,969 --> 00:43:21,299
going down because we're disrupting

1189
00:43:19,589 --> 00:43:23,549
either of our subs to the Chinese either

1190
00:43:21,299 --> 00:43:25,649
way we win now as we're getting to the

1191
00:43:23,549 --> 00:43:27,929
higher end of saying all right we need

1192
00:43:25,649 --> 00:43:29,880
to not just disrupt the specific

1193
00:43:27,929 --> 00:43:31,109
infrastructure but when we're talking

1194
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:33,209
about the tacit bargain and the other

1195
00:43:31,109 --> 00:43:35,249
parts the yeah these attributions the

1196
00:43:33,209 --> 00:43:37,678
false flag and attributions been getting

1197
00:43:35,249 --> 00:43:38,908
easier and easier for the US but it can

1198
00:43:37,679 --> 00:43:40,759
go the other way and get harder and

1199
00:43:38,909 --> 00:43:43,289
harder and you're right that would put

1200
00:43:40,759 --> 00:43:44,549
that would put the argument of

1201
00:43:43,289 --> 00:43:45,989
persistent engagement under a lot more

1202
00:43:44,549 --> 00:43:48,509
pressure and it would put some of the

1203
00:43:45,989 --> 00:43:52,019
measurement like the third one that we

1204
00:43:48,509 --> 00:43:54,630
talked about the fiery red lines drawn

1205
00:43:52,019 --> 00:44:01,919
that would complicate those more

1206
00:43:54,630 --> 00:44:07,619
specific measurements the others okay

1207
00:44:01,919 --> 00:44:09,719
yeah we got one hi Charlie Mitchell with

1208
00:44:07,619 --> 00:44:12,659
insight cybersecurity I was interested

1209
00:44:09,719 --> 00:44:14,849
in your take on the some of the actions

1210
00:44:12,659 --> 00:44:16,210
being aimed at Chinese companies like

1211
00:44:14,849 --> 00:44:19,089
Huawei and

1212
00:44:16,210 --> 00:44:21,940
both the the deterrence value that you

1213
00:44:19,089 --> 00:44:24,490
may see in that and the security value

1214
00:44:21,940 --> 00:44:27,400
and going after these specific projects

1215
00:44:24,490 --> 00:44:30,729
are specific products and I understand

1216
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:34,750
in terms of context that today DoD and

1217
00:44:30,730 --> 00:44:36,819
GSA put out their rulemaking on banning

1218
00:44:34,750 --> 00:44:38,530
the purchases of these products across

1219
00:44:36,819 --> 00:44:39,910
the government enterprise and they're

1220
00:44:38,530 --> 00:44:41,349
trying to ban the purchases in the

1221
00:44:39,910 --> 00:44:44,920
private sector as well what do you think

1222
00:44:41,349 --> 00:44:47,050
of as the effectiveness of this take

1223
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:49,660
that I mean I think in some ways it's

1224
00:44:47,050 --> 00:44:53,380
kind of separate and apart from this

1225
00:44:49,660 --> 00:44:55,720
specific DoD focused activity that we've

1226
00:44:53,380 --> 00:44:57,550
been talking about is more much more

1227
00:44:55,720 --> 00:45:00,848
closer to a whole-of-government based

1228
00:44:57,550 --> 00:45:03,339
approach that that could be used for

1229
00:45:00,849 --> 00:45:06,069
security I think there are you know a

1230
00:45:03,339 --> 00:45:08,049
lot of reasons there why you would be

1231
00:45:06,069 --> 00:45:09,099
taking those actions against kwame and

1232
00:45:08,050 --> 00:45:11,020
some of those companies and they're not

1233
00:45:09,099 --> 00:45:14,200
necessarily just cyber security focused

1234
00:45:11,020 --> 00:45:17,559
but yeah I'm a bet you know it took me a

1235
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:19,689
long time to get on the government's for

1236
00:45:17,559 --> 00:45:20,740
me to understand all of their arguments

1237
00:45:19,690 --> 00:45:24,190
cuz I don't think the government's been

1238
00:45:20,740 --> 00:45:26,859
really good about talking about 5g in

1239
00:45:24,190 --> 00:45:31,119
these other these other issues

1240
00:45:26,859 --> 00:45:33,069
I'm sure this fits together in the White

1241
00:45:31,119 --> 00:45:35,859
House strategy this fits probably fits

1242
00:45:33,069 --> 00:45:37,029
together in Bolton's mind of saying yes

1243
00:45:35,859 --> 00:45:38,828
we're gonna we're gonna do these

1244
00:45:37,030 --> 00:45:40,240
military operations over here that's

1245
00:45:38,829 --> 00:45:42,640
gonna worry about the Chinese but we

1246
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:44,649
need to worry about the Chinese on not

1247
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:45,970
letting the you know the student you

1248
00:45:44,650 --> 00:45:48,000
know be more cautious on Chinese

1249
00:45:45,970 --> 00:45:50,680
students coming in be more cautious on

1250
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:52,480
immigration policy be more cautious on

1251
00:45:50,680 --> 00:45:56,919
what technology we're allowing in

1252
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:59,170
because if we stop the the Huawei gear

1253
00:45:56,920 --> 00:46:01,089
coming in now then that saves us trouble

1254
00:45:59,170 --> 00:46:03,010
of the active operations later because

1255
00:46:01,089 --> 00:46:05,380
they won't even be in the infrastructure

1256
00:46:03,010 --> 00:46:07,299
to begin with so I don't know that

1257
00:46:05,380 --> 00:46:08,920
they've ever really laid that out that

1258
00:46:07,299 --> 00:46:10,630
much even in though even in the White

1259
00:46:08,920 --> 00:46:12,880
House strategy I don't think they laid

1260
00:46:10,630 --> 00:46:16,240
that out but I think it's a reasonable

1261
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:17,829
argument to say that these are all and

1262
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:21,700
our hands are untied we're going to be

1263
00:46:17,829 --> 00:46:23,280
much more active the DoD or the National

1264
00:46:21,700 --> 00:46:24,509
Security Strategy was talking about

1265
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:28,260
there

1266
00:46:24,510 --> 00:46:30,690
a great power competition and so I think

1267
00:46:28,260 --> 00:46:33,150
this all fits in and that silo a great

1268
00:46:30,690 --> 00:46:34,560
great being more active and contending

1269
00:46:33,150 --> 00:46:36,330
with our adversaries in great power

1270
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:37,440
competition it would be nice if they

1271
00:46:36,330 --> 00:46:39,900
came out and kind of said that a little

1272
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:44,520
bit more clearly but I think it yeah

1273
00:46:39,900 --> 00:46:46,109
I'll leave it that next trial okay we're

1274
00:46:44,520 --> 00:46:49,259
about we might have time for one more or

1275
00:46:46,109 --> 00:46:50,580
we will just call it there and we call

1276
00:46:49,260 --> 00:46:51,160
it there thank you thank you very much

1277
00:46:50,580 --> 00:46:55,360
very much

1278
00:46:51,160 --> 00:46:55,359
[Applause]
