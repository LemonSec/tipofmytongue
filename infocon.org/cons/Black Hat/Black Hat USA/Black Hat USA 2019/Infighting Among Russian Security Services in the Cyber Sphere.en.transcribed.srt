presentation and now please welcome

20
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:50,309
Kimberly sense hello so today I'm going

21
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:52,140
to talk about infighting among the

22
00:00:50,309 --> 00:00:54,570
Russian security services in the cyber

23
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:57,000
sphere or how Brian Krebs made the FSB

24
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:59,969
searched my apartment which he did but

25
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,219
we'll get to that but before I start I

26
00:00:59,969 --> 00:01:04,290
do want to say a few things just about

27
00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:05,850
Russia the topic of Russia particularly

28
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:08,100
the security services can be quite

29
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:10,289
polarizing and although I'm about to

30
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:13,259
talk about a lot of things that are

31
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:16,140
largely negative I don't want to end up

32
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:17,790
in the camp of you know everything from

33
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:19,740
Russia's bad everyone coming out of

34
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:21,330
Russia is bad and everything bad comes

35
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:22,949
out of Russia there are people there

36
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:25,170
that I really respect there are people

37
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:26,580
there who are really amazing I love

38
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:29,040
Russia I went there for the first time

39
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:30,360
when I was 14 and I just I think it's

40
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:33,390
really great and I kind of just wanted

41
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:35,130
to get that out there first but you know

42
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:36,479
it is an industry place it's a

43
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:38,640
fascinating place it can be a

44
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:40,679
challenging place it is a rapidly

45
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:43,110
changing place it has been for a while

46
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:46,770
and while some of these change has been

47
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:48,780
good some of it does lead to problems it

48
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:50,759
causes uncertainty which leads to

49
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:52,680
competition and pressure to deliver wins

50
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:55,470
now instead of you know to be able to

51
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:57,060
build more robust programs over time and

52
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:59,429
that competition has real consequences

53
00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:01,110
for people stuck in the middle it has

54
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:02,579
consequences for some people I worked

55
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:05,640
with in Russia and it has consequences

56
00:02:02,579 --> 00:02:07,829
for me because Moscow military court

57
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:10,288
accused me of being an American agent as

58
00:02:07,829 --> 00:02:12,700
part of a treason trial there when that

59
00:02:10,288 --> 00:02:14,859
happened I tried to look in

60
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:16,988
what was going on I did my best to

61
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:21,700
figure it out and that is the topic of

62
00:02:16,989 --> 00:02:23,440
my talk today so first a brief agenda

63
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:24,940
what we're going to talk about a little

64
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:26,950
bit of an overview just the current

65
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:29,440
situation regarding infighting what's

66
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:30,970
happening what we know is observable

67
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:33,760
infighting things that be can be

68
00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:35,290
confirmed from the outside then a bit

69
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:37,510
more about the treason case itself

70
00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:39,670
what officially happened and why I think

71
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:41,500
it really happened and then listen learn

72
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:42,819
my case is somewhat extreme but I think

73
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:45,310
they're still really our lessons for

74
00:02:42,819 --> 00:02:48,220
people working in the industry that can

75
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:51,220
be gained it's the first current

76
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:53,170
situation right now in Russia there is a

77
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:55,150
situation of escalating infighting been

78
00:02:53,170 --> 00:02:56,980
finding is not unique to Russia many

79
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:59,200
countries have interagency competition

80
00:02:56,980 --> 00:03:00,970
but it is more pronounced there and it

81
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:03,880
is also more pronounced there than it

82
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:05,650
was a few years ago phrase I often come

83
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:06,970
across just in reporting people talking

84
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:09,459
about that is previously unthinkable

85
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:10,150
that is the amount of infighting and the

86
00:03:09,459 --> 00:03:12,280
consequent

87
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:14,349
consequences for infighting have reached

88
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:17,049
a level that was previously unthinkable

89
00:03:14,349 --> 00:03:19,179
there are a range of causes from geo

90
00:03:17,049 --> 00:03:21,459
political pressures economic uncertainty

91
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:23,260
elite conflicts shifting power from

92
00:03:21,459 --> 00:03:25,780
formal institutions and just the

93
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:27,069
unpredictable political future and of

94
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:28,870
course me I don't have a lot of time to

95
00:03:27,069 --> 00:03:30,940
get into that itself that's its own talk

96
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:33,609
but if you want to talk about it find me

97
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:35,230
later and I will happily chat there has

98
00:03:33,609 --> 00:03:38,109
been a notable increase in the

99
00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:40,298
infighting since 2014 2014 was the time

100
00:03:38,109 --> 00:03:42,130
of the Maidan protests in Ukraine which

101
00:03:40,299 --> 00:03:43,420
caused what much protesters caused a

102
00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:44,769
change of government which did cause

103
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:46,750
some concern in Russia about that

104
00:03:44,769 --> 00:03:48,940
possibly happening there and it also was

105
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:50,470
the time when fighting began in eastern

106
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:53,139
Ukraine and the conflicts over there and

107
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:54,910
then Russia took Crimea which put Russia

108
00:03:53,139 --> 00:03:56,739
in a difficult geopolitical and

109
00:03:54,910 --> 00:04:00,280
environmental position which again just

110
00:03:56,739 --> 00:04:02,079
exacerbated tensions in the country one

111
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:06,010
big thing that has changed is the

112
00:04:02,079 --> 00:04:08,049
outcomes prior to 2014 if you lost some

113
00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:09,429
kind of an institutional conflict there

114
00:04:08,049 --> 00:04:12,010
was a good chance you would lose your

115
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:13,180
job you would might face criminal

116
00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:14,679
charges but you probably weren't going

117
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:16,180
to go to jail you might even keep your

118
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:18,760
ranks and benefits you might keep your

119
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:22,150
money so it wouldn't be good but you

120
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:24,460
probably be okay now you're more likely

121
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:26,320
to face arrest and prison also

122
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:27,880
previously safe positions are now

123
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:29,200
Sakura is sitting cabinet minister is

124
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:32,740
currently serving eight years in a labor

125
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:35,170
colony after losing a conflict the

126
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:36,880
political scientist Nikolai Petroff

127
00:04:35,170 --> 00:04:38,800
canted amongst the national needs last

128
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:41,650
year 35 high-ranking officials are

129
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:43,090
prosecuted 25 got prison time in 18 more

130
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:46,030
than five years this is quite a lot

131
00:04:43,090 --> 00:04:48,460
among the regional elites about 18 to 20

132
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:50,440
were arrested from about 800 I mean

133
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:51,969
that's only 2% it doesn't sound like a

134
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:54,370
lot but if you do that for 40 years

135
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:56,170
that's everybody and that's governor's

136
00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:58,150
vice governor's things like that a

137
00:04:56,170 --> 00:05:00,640
different political scientist Kyoto

138
00:04:58,150 --> 00:05:02,650
Rogoff did investigations he found that

139
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:04,090
I did looked into the investigations and

140
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:06,130
he found that they tripled in the last

141
00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:09,580
seven years of the biggest growth

142
00:05:06,130 --> 00:05:11,020
recently so why do we care a lot of

143
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:12,520
people in this audience will probably

144
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:15,280
come at this from a Western perspective

145
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:17,020
which is that you know Russian security

146
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:19,570
services particularly those conducting

147
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:22,049
online operations are an adversary and

148
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:23,860
if they're having problems well good I

149
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:25,000
understand that perspective there's an

150
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:27,040
argument for it but there are also

151
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,690
reasons why it's not good I mean

152
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:30,520
internal politics it drives this

153
00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:32,410
interests of the people in the security

154
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:34,359
services that makes them feel like they

155
00:05:32,410 --> 00:05:36,520
have to do things now to position

156
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:39,220
themself well against their domestic

157
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:41,049
rivals as opposed to building longer

158
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:43,210
well thought-out projects that can

159
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:44,830
position themselves regarding Russia's

160
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:46,599
long-term strategic goals this

161
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:49,150
incentivizes them to take risks and act

162
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:50,920
aggressively some some examples some

163
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:53,650
very aggressive and risky behavior that

164
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:55,900
had unintended add-on effects I think or

165
00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:58,810
it's a not Petya not pet SIA the

166
00:05:55,900 --> 00:06:00,340
official or the official the real that

167
00:05:58,810 --> 00:06:02,560
should be our motivations from that

168
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:03,729
Petya are somewhat under the bait but it

169
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:05,980
does seem pretty clear they were trying

170
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:07,630
to target Ukraine I don't believe that

171
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:09,910
anyone in any of the Russian security

172
00:06:07,630 --> 00:06:12,820
services was trying to cause 10 billions

173
00:06:09,910 --> 00:06:14,680
of dollars in global damages and slow

174
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:17,080
shipping and stop medications being

175
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:19,450
produced but they didn't because it got

176
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:22,530
out of control another example I find

177
00:06:19,450 --> 00:06:24,760
kind of worrying is triton that was a

178
00:06:22,530 --> 00:06:27,070
that was in it using an attack on a

179
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:30,190
saudi petrochemicals at a facility that

180
00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:31,570
was linked to iran and in that case that

181
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:32,530
it had had been fully successful it

182
00:06:31,570 --> 00:06:34,270
would have caused an explosion that

183
00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:35,349
killed people and in that case they were

184
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:37,000
only able to get as far as they did

185
00:06:35,350 --> 00:06:38,919
because russian military institute

186
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,960
providing components of that malware so

187
00:06:38,919 --> 00:06:41,639
if you see people there

188
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:43,109
increasing the capability of other

189
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:45,810
countries that had even more risky

190
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:47,430
threat models like Iran then that's

191
00:06:45,810 --> 00:06:49,500
worrying and I think it was even an

192
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:51,660
argument that the screwball poisonings

193
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:53,130
which ended in a fatality do have some

194
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:55,680
add-on effects from this competition

195
00:06:53,130 --> 00:06:58,530
that came on the heels of some very

196
00:06:55,680 --> 00:07:00,570
embarrassing us disclosures about

197
00:06:58,530 --> 00:07:03,059
hacking in about efforts to hack US

198
00:07:00,570 --> 00:07:05,340
elections resources in America and the

199
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:07,020
agency who suffered those kind of was in

200
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:09,960
the need for a feel-good win so they

201
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:11,969
tried to kill a former agent turned spy

202
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:14,039
for the British let's take a screwball

203
00:07:11,970 --> 00:07:15,750
they poison him but they didn't kill and

204
00:07:14,039 --> 00:07:16,259
they hospitalized him they hospitalized

205
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:18,150
his daughter

206
00:07:16,259 --> 00:07:19,500
they hospitalized an unrelated British

207
00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:21,239
citizen and they killed an unrelated

208
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:23,759
British citizen so this kind of behavior

209
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:25,740
you know it has add-on effects here that

210
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:28,440
we do have to carry about but also it

211
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:29,490
hurts cooperation and I said work on my

212
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:31,110
backgrounds that you know i entice

213
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:32,940
either crime stuff like that whole

214
00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:35,340
system the whole community functions on

215
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:37,380
international cooperation if you're

216
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:39,388
there thinking that if I do something

217
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:41,430
too helpful abroad that could be used by

218
00:07:39,389 --> 00:07:43,860
my rivals to make it look like I'm not

219
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:46,169
fully loyal then you're too afraid to do

220
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:47,760
it it also makes it impossible to talk a

221
00:07:46,169 --> 00:07:49,169
lot of countries including the United

222
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:50,880
States are escalating their offensive

223
00:07:49,169 --> 00:07:52,799
operations and it makes it really

224
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:54,990
difficult to discuss efforts to avoid

225
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:56,310
unintentional escalations if the other

226
00:07:54,990 --> 00:07:57,659
side is too afraid to talk to you

227
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:59,699
because their rivals are gonna make it

228
00:07:57,659 --> 00:08:02,370
look like they're not truly loyal and it

229
00:07:59,699 --> 00:08:05,760
could be used against them later so it's

230
00:08:02,370 --> 00:08:07,830
not really great for anyone so moving on

231
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:09,840
what we know I have first up a brief

232
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:11,280
slide about some but not all the major

233
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:12,810
players I mean you know there's bear

234
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:15,239
with me but for those that you don't

235
00:08:12,810 --> 00:08:17,759
there you go the first is the interior

236
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:19,830
ministry ministerial MacNeill which is

237
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:21,900
how it gets its acronym and VD they're

238
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:24,419
not very active internationally as the

239
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:25,710
name would suggest but they do have law

240
00:08:24,419 --> 00:08:27,479
enforcement capabilities at home

241
00:08:25,710 --> 00:08:29,489
including anti cybercrime investigations

242
00:08:27,479 --> 00:08:31,469
but also in anti-corruption which is a

243
00:08:29,490 --> 00:08:34,620
big part of excuse me which is a big

244
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:36,539
part of the corruption opera aired in

245
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:39,570
Fighting's its corruption incubations

246
00:08:36,539 --> 00:08:41,069
the next is the GRU that's the main

247
00:08:39,570 --> 00:08:44,579
Directorate of the General Staff of the

248
00:08:41,070 --> 00:08:46,920
Armed Forces technically that's GU it

249
00:08:44,579 --> 00:08:49,079
used to be the GRU but everyone still

250
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:49,540
says GRU including Russian media and the

251
00:08:49,079 --> 00:08:50,890
government

252
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:52,360
I'm actually just mentioning that

253
00:08:50,890 --> 00:08:54,850
because there are some trolls that like

254
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:55,750
to jump on anyone who doesn't call it GU

255
00:08:54,850 --> 00:08:56,590
as proof that they don't know what

256
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:58,930
they're talking about

257
00:08:56,590 --> 00:09:00,460
it's still a GRU and they're the

258
00:08:58,930 --> 00:09:02,680
military but they do have an

259
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:03,910
intelligence component and there that's

260
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:06,339
a reputation for being the most

261
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:07,990
aggressive the United the UK national

262
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:09,280
cybersecurity center called a recent

263
00:09:07,990 --> 00:09:12,880
spate of their attacks indiscriminate

264
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:15,189
and reckless the main rival to the GRU

265
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:17,080
is the FSB they're the Federal Security

266
00:09:15,190 --> 00:09:19,240
Bureau did that all - literally did the

267
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:20,560
plasticity they are they have a

268
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:22,750
reputation of being more professional

269
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:24,609
more conservative in their espionage

270
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:26,170
operations but domestically they also

271
00:09:24,610 --> 00:09:27,940
have a law enforcement component and

272
00:09:26,170 --> 00:09:30,099
they are the ones who have been involved

273
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:32,620
in pretty much every major cybercrime

274
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:34,690
bat bust in Russia in the recent years

275
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:36,040
within the FSB there are a lot of

276
00:09:34,690 --> 00:09:38,440
divisions but there's - I'm going to

277
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:40,089
talk about today the first is a czi the

278
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:42,400
Center for the protection of information

279
00:09:40,090 --> 00:09:43,870
and special communication synthesis

280
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:47,530
sheet the infra mozzies its the Omni

281
00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:48,850
scalzi and then they share a lot of room

282
00:09:47,530 --> 00:09:51,189
excuse me share a lot of

283
00:09:48,850 --> 00:09:53,290
responsibilities with the CIB the center

284
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:56,560
of information Security's influence the

285
00:09:53,290 --> 00:09:57,849
only do is apostasy and the CIB is here

286
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:59,770
they're kind of an interesting case

287
00:09:57,850 --> 00:10:01,570
because they have they've been involved

288
00:09:59,770 --> 00:10:03,520
in pretty much also every major anti

289
00:10:01,570 --> 00:10:04,990
cybercrime bust in recent years they are

290
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:06,520
the ones who did it but also some

291
00:10:04,990 --> 00:10:09,460
espionage which I'll get into a little

292
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:11,710
bit later and then I put in an honorable

293
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:12,940
mention Kaspersky Lab I know that their

294
00:10:11,710 --> 00:10:14,230
QC you're laughing that's not what I

295
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:18,100
mean that's where this is going

296
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:19,600
their use of working with the Russian

297
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:21,070
security services for astronauts

298
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:22,990
purposes that is not what I mean to

299
00:10:21,070 --> 00:10:25,390
suggest in this talk I don't have any

300
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:27,580
secret Kaspersky spy information and I'm

301
00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:28,660
not trying to say that there that that's

302
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:30,010
it of it that's I would love to go to

303
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:32,829
that talk if someone wants to have that

304
00:10:30,010 --> 00:10:35,710
talk but anyway they're there because

305
00:10:32,830 --> 00:10:38,110
they they're cyber crime investigations

306
00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:40,240
team work extremely close to the CIB and

307
00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:42,220
also played a role in basically every

308
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:43,960
major cybercrime bust in recent years

309
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:45,760
and their relationship was very close

310
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:47,620
and that that's why they're there I am

311
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:51,220
NOT that other stuff is very interesting

312
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:52,960
but I just I'm not the source on that so

313
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:54,640
sometimes you can see the infighting

314
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:56,290
pretty publicly it's pretty observable

315
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:59,800
it's easiest when the media reports

316
00:10:56,290 --> 00:11:01,699
about it I guess my favorite example is

317
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:02,839
the interior ministry has division

318
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:05,450
the division for the fighting at

319
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:07,070
cybercrime I think since 2008 the media

320
00:11:05,450 --> 00:11:09,350
has reported its gonna join the FSB

321
00:11:07,070 --> 00:11:10,850
still hasn't happened because MPD is

322
00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:12,650
able to push back but you know there's

323
00:11:10,850 --> 00:11:15,200
some content sometimes you can see it in

324
00:11:12,650 --> 00:11:16,730
reports of transit responsibilities the

325
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:18,590
GRU was supposed to create a national

326
00:11:16,730 --> 00:11:20,330
cert a year later there were reports

327
00:11:18,590 --> 00:11:23,390
that the FSB would now be creating the

328
00:11:20,330 --> 00:11:24,230
National cert like that sometimes you

329
00:11:23,390 --> 00:11:26,090
can infer it

330
00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:27,680
I mentioned the sea is the eye and CIB

331
00:11:26,090 --> 00:11:30,020
have a lot of overlapping capabilities

332
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:32,000
that doesn't guarantee infighting but it

333
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:33,680
does guarantee some level of competition

334
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,060
and one can infer that in this

335
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:37,160
environment that's probably happening

336
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:38,750
out of that and it's the easiest when

337
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:40,579
you see it interests and their results

338
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:42,080
perhaps the most famous case in recent

339
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:44,180
years were that of generals

340
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:46,010
denis.sokolov and Boris class sneaked

341
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:47,780
off they were the two youngest generals

342
00:11:46,010 --> 00:11:49,880
at the history of the Ministry of

343
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:52,189
Internal Affairs they were doing major

344
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:55,370
arresting it's very high-ranking people

345
00:11:52,190 --> 00:11:58,040
they pushed up against the FSB they lost

346
00:11:55,370 --> 00:11:59,930
they got themselves arrested cadets Niko

347
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:01,969
have killed himself and soon well got 22

348
00:11:59,930 --> 00:12:03,530
years in jail and ever since all the

349
00:12:01,970 --> 00:12:06,740
major cases that they used to be trying

350
00:12:03,530 --> 00:12:09,770
are now being tried are being run by

351
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:12,380
division six in the FSB by general Koch

352
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:14,030
of Jeff who is known as such ins general

353
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:16,400
and he's like one of the most powerful

354
00:12:14,030 --> 00:12:17,900
people in Russia so you can actually

355
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:19,790
like you see it in the arrests but then

356
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:21,620
you also see it in one of the cases are

357
00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:24,050
going after that who's who's prosecuting

358
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:26,210
means investigating sometimes you can

359
00:12:24,050 --> 00:12:28,699
see it in overlapping attacks in an

360
00:12:26,210 --> 00:12:30,950
ideal situation multiple agencies within

361
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:33,230
a single country would not be targeting

362
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:35,510
the same people at the same time it

363
00:12:33,230 --> 00:12:36,950
wastes of limited resources and it also

364
00:12:35,510 --> 00:12:38,960
increases a chance that if one gets

365
00:12:36,950 --> 00:12:40,820
caught they'll all get burned but there

366
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:42,320
are multiple cases of multiple Russian

367
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:43,760
agency is going after them and seeing

368
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:45,530
this in Germany which is where I live

369
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:47,330
the best known case is probably that of

370
00:12:45,530 --> 00:12:48,500
the Germans Bundestag hacks the

371
00:12:47,330 --> 00:12:50,120
Bundestag at the Parliament the

372
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:52,490
parliamentary network and most of all

373
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:54,830
and multiple multiple political parties

374
00:12:52,490 --> 00:12:57,830
were compromised around the same time by

375
00:12:54,830 --> 00:13:00,620
the FSB specifically a PT 29 and the GRU

376
00:12:57,830 --> 00:13:02,090
a PT 28 in the u.s. I'm guessing the

377
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:03,470
most famous case is that of the

378
00:13:02,090 --> 00:13:06,080
Democratic National Committee where

379
00:13:03,470 --> 00:13:09,050
CrowdStrike identified again a PT 29 and

380
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:10,790
a BT 28 there so at the very least this

381
00:13:09,050 --> 00:13:11,839
shows they're not communicating it shows

382
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:12,640
they're competing to get the same

383
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:14,530
information

384
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:18,939
and it does suggest some organizational

385
00:13:14,530 --> 00:13:22,720
dysfunction so moving on the trees in

386
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:24,880
case this is the there we go this is

387
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:26,770
actually what I was able to put together

388
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:28,360
regarding some of the players

389
00:13:26,770 --> 00:13:30,069
I can't unfortunately go through this

390
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:32,950
entire chart because that's a four-hour

391
00:13:30,070 --> 00:13:35,680
talk the original paper this is based on

392
00:13:32,950 --> 00:13:37,210
started out like 80 pages but just to

393
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:38,500
give you an idea of what's going on in

394
00:13:37,210 --> 00:13:39,760
the network and then the guys and the

395
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:41,080
circles those are ones who are accused

396
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:44,380
of treason so you can kind of see where

397
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:46,090
they are and who are they first is this

398
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:47,650
Leslie Onam Russell stay on it was the

399
00:13:46,090 --> 00:13:50,620
head of cyber criminal investigations at

400
00:13:47,650 --> 00:13:52,480
Kaspersky Lab I know Rosalyn I deeply

401
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:55,030
respect whistlin he is arguably the best

402
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:56,710
respected and most well known cyber

403
00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:58,540
criminal investigator in Russia

404
00:13:56,710 --> 00:14:00,640
he's also highly networked he worked

405
00:13:58,540 --> 00:14:02,890
internationally he worked at you know in

406
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:05,110
Russia very much too and has played a

407
00:14:02,890 --> 00:14:07,960
role in basically almost every major

408
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:10,300
cyber criminal bust in recent years in

409
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:12,790
Russia and he did it active while at

410
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:14,349
Kaspersky but he did it working with FSB

411
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:16,480
Center information security

412
00:14:14,350 --> 00:14:19,210
the second akyuu man accused of treason

413
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:20,980
is Colonel Seguin McAuliffe he was the

414
00:14:19,210 --> 00:14:22,990
deputy there's several deputies but he

415
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:25,180
was reportedly like the main deputy the

416
00:14:22,990 --> 00:14:28,810
right-hand man of the general leading it

417
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:31,390
at the FSB CIB the next guy is his

418
00:14:28,810 --> 00:14:33,699
deputy colonel Dmitri the kochiya and

419
00:14:31,390 --> 00:14:36,160
Tamia is a very interesting guy because

420
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:39,640
in addition to being an FSB colonel

421
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:42,490
being involved in one like a major

422
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:45,790
arrests over recent years he's also has

423
00:14:42,490 --> 00:14:48,970
the unique distinguished by ever

424
00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:50,380
indicted FSB agents for espionage he's

425
00:14:48,970 --> 00:14:55,240
wanted in both countries he's a lucky

426
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:58,090
guy but he played an important role in

427
00:14:55,240 --> 00:15:00,850
the Yahoo attacks so that's been a

428
00:14:58,090 --> 00:15:02,260
target in America and then also that's

429
00:15:00,850 --> 00:15:03,670
him on the right Hubbell years ago

430
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:05,200
that's him on the left when he was a

431
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:07,709
young cyber criminal going by the handle

432
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:10,150
form so he just had an interesting life

433
00:15:07,710 --> 00:15:12,040
the next guy accused of treason is

434
00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:13,569
Gregory from Genco I have not been able

435
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:15,699
to find out a lot of good information

436
00:15:13,570 --> 00:15:18,370
about from Genco I've seen him reported

437
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:20,830
as a programmer as a businessman as an X

438
00:15:18,370 --> 00:15:22,900
FSB agent and is a distributor of

439
00:15:20,830 --> 00:15:25,459
pornography using the handle Gizem I

440
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:26,329
honestly don't know

441
00:15:25,459 --> 00:15:29,059
I certainly don't know about its porn

442
00:15:26,329 --> 00:15:31,099
life but I don't know why he's mixed up

443
00:15:29,059 --> 00:15:32,118
in this in the same way that I can see

444
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:35,449
for the other guys

445
00:15:32,119 --> 00:15:37,429
and there's me I was accused of being a

446
00:15:35,449 --> 00:15:40,248
u.s. agent depending on the reporting

447
00:15:37,429 --> 00:15:42,920
sometimes FSM FBI sometimes CIA and

448
00:15:40,249 --> 00:15:45,439
actually none I'm an unclear herbal dual

449
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:49,550
citizen who was in Germany but you know

450
00:15:45,439 --> 00:15:51,709
such it is so first we'll look at the

451
00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:53,779
accusations Russian reports say that

452
00:15:51,709 --> 00:15:55,849
this is what they were charged with not

453
00:15:53,779 --> 00:15:58,189
what actually happened in 2010 the FBI

454
00:15:55,850 --> 00:16:00,410
paid FSB offices so gave me Highland and

455
00:15:58,189 --> 00:16:01,879
the me Pacheco trial ten million dollars

456
00:16:00,410 --> 00:16:03,589
to deliver two CDs containing

457
00:16:01,879 --> 00:16:05,509
information about well-known Russian

458
00:16:03,589 --> 00:16:07,069
cyber criminal positive Bielski he's

459
00:16:05,509 --> 00:16:08,839
really well known like there's a book

460
00:16:07,069 --> 00:16:11,389
about how much criminal he is that Brian

461
00:16:08,839 --> 00:16:13,160
Krebs wrote and this happened shortly

462
00:16:11,389 --> 00:16:16,610
before video skis arrest and conviction

463
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:18,410
in Russia so they say some chanko flew

464
00:16:16,610 --> 00:16:20,179
to America to deliver one CD and

465
00:16:18,410 --> 00:16:23,480
Seongnam is said to have given the other

466
00:16:20,179 --> 00:16:25,550
CD to an American agent that's me at a

467
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:27,619
cybercrime conference in Canada this is

468
00:16:25,550 --> 00:16:29,660
problematic for several reasons first of

469
00:16:27,619 --> 00:16:32,119
all this is not a new idea this idea

470
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:34,339
first surfaced in 2010 would probably be

471
00:16:32,119 --> 00:16:35,749
BOC facing arrest created this

472
00:16:34,339 --> 00:16:37,399
conspiracy theory to try to take down

473
00:16:35,749 --> 00:16:39,110
the people he thought we're trying to

474
00:16:37,399 --> 00:16:40,850
put him in jail everyone on that list

475
00:16:39,110 --> 00:16:42,019
except from Genco I don't really know

476
00:16:40,850 --> 00:16:44,240
what his deal is but everyone else in

477
00:16:42,019 --> 00:16:46,069
that list right down to me where's at

478
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:47,869
either at the cybercrime conference or

479
00:16:46,069 --> 00:16:49,878
Acton talking about what a criminal he

480
00:16:47,869 --> 00:16:51,679
was or actively involved in his

481
00:16:49,879 --> 00:16:54,649
investigation and ultimately did put him

482
00:16:51,679 --> 00:16:55,999
in jail if the Russian government does

483
00:16:54,649 --> 00:16:58,699
take real treason and espionage

484
00:16:55,999 --> 00:17:00,559
seriously he was pushing this so hard

485
00:16:58,699 --> 00:17:02,420
if they thought this was an important

486
00:17:00,559 --> 00:17:03,618
thing that it really happened they would

487
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:04,938
have done something about it at the time

488
00:17:03,619 --> 00:17:08,360
but instead they just dismissed it him

489
00:17:04,939 --> 00:17:10,220
and arrested him another issue is the

490
00:17:08,359 --> 00:17:11,958
money ten million dollars is a lot of

491
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:14,149
information to pay about a cyber

492
00:17:11,959 --> 00:17:15,980
criminal if you compare that the FBI is

493
00:17:14,148 --> 00:17:17,629
offering three million dollars for the

494
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:20,510
information leading to the arrest not

495
00:17:17,630 --> 00:17:21,949
just information about you've gone give

496
00:17:20,510 --> 00:17:23,809
Guinea bull which of Austin earnest

497
00:17:21,949 --> 00:17:25,459
Slovak who was a way bigger cyber

498
00:17:23,809 --> 00:17:27,349
criminal then probably from bos key ever

499
00:17:25,459 --> 00:17:29,299
was although me not that's him he likes

500
00:17:27,349 --> 00:17:32,178
to pose like he's a boss he did that

501
00:17:29,299 --> 00:17:33,230
picture himself but you know burger

502
00:17:32,179 --> 00:17:35,210
truck actually wanted he was a real

503
00:17:33,230 --> 00:17:36,649
cyber crime boss and also a spy on the

504
00:17:35,210 --> 00:17:37,940
side so like if they would only pay

505
00:17:36,649 --> 00:17:39,320
three million for his arrest it's a

506
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:41,630
little much to think they paid ten

507
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:43,189
and for info about him also the money is

508
00:17:41,630 --> 00:17:45,200
a little ridiculous because around this

509
00:17:43,190 --> 00:17:46,580
time Papa Derby ups he got into a

510
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:48,650
conflict with his former criminal

511
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:51,260
partner he wouldn't've also known his

512
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:53,330
desk and somebody hacked his front

513
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:54,920
company chrono pay stole thousands and

514
00:17:53,330 --> 00:17:57,080
thousands of incriminating documents and

515
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:58,340
posted them online so the FBI didn't

516
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:59,600
actually pay anything they could just

517
00:17:58,340 --> 00:18:04,550
get the information for free and

518
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:06,439
download it I mean I did and then also I

519
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:08,990
just I kind of laugh at the logistics

520
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:11,630
like I don't know how FSB officers share

521
00:18:08,990 --> 00:18:12,710
secret information with the CIA but I'm

522
00:18:11,630 --> 00:18:15,830
pretty sure they don't do it on the CDs

523
00:18:12,710 --> 00:18:18,290
it's like 2010 and like why fly to CDs

524
00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:19,669
to America like just and of course the

525
00:18:18,290 --> 00:18:22,100
other figures I'm not actually a US

526
00:18:19,670 --> 00:18:26,330
government agent so you know there's

527
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:27,949
that so what why did this happen if the

528
00:18:26,330 --> 00:18:30,050
Cohens sorry actually let me go back I

529
00:18:27,950 --> 00:18:31,610
forgot something very important so in

530
00:18:30,050 --> 00:18:33,169
this treason trial there was a witness

531
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:34,399
and that was probably be upski the

532
00:18:33,170 --> 00:18:36,410
criminal that they put in jail was

533
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:38,540
testifying against them I was not a

534
00:18:36,410 --> 00:18:41,330
witness I sent a letter to the military

535
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:43,100
court saying supposedly I took the CD I

536
00:18:41,330 --> 00:18:45,020
was at the conference which we Bielski

537
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:46,459
was not I would like to testify and they

538
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:49,610
said no which tells me they're not

539
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:51,140
taking the actual charges very seriously

540
00:18:49,610 --> 00:18:52,790
because if I really am an agent that

541
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:54,470
would be pretty exciting to talk to me I

542
00:18:52,790 --> 00:18:56,330
was actually also there right before the

543
00:18:54,470 --> 00:18:57,860
arrest according to I sell us in a

544
00:18:56,330 --> 00:19:00,679
Russian news report that the decision to

545
00:18:57,860 --> 00:19:03,500
arrest them was made in September 26

546
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:06,410
2016 I was there in November shortly

547
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:08,240
before the arrest 2016 if they wanted to

548
00:19:06,410 --> 00:19:09,500
question me at any time they thought

549
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:10,880
that I was a serious threat to the

550
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:13,720
government or an agent they had an

551
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:16,430
opportunity and they didn't want me so

552
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:18,320
anyway so why then a big thing is

553
00:19:16,430 --> 00:19:20,210
infighting something is happening that

554
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:22,460
is that is weakening the side so much

555
00:19:20,210 --> 00:19:24,050
that they end up with kind of deals

556
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:27,560
unfortunately the result of infighting

557
00:19:24,050 --> 00:19:29,360
in Russia which is Jail there's a theory

558
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:30,679
that this is Rubio skis revenge that

559
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:32,270
these are the people who put him in jail

560
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:36,050
this is his way of getting back at them

561
00:19:32,270 --> 00:19:38,330
he what is interesting about him was he

562
00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:39,710
left his prison sentence early he had a

563
00:19:38,330 --> 00:19:41,929
co-conspirator who told the New York

564
00:19:39,710 --> 00:19:43,730
Times that he was made an offer to get a

565
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:45,350
saint get out of his sentence early if

566
00:19:43,730 --> 00:19:47,390
he would agree to work for the state if

567
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:49,010
he got out and the co-conspirators had

568
00:19:47,390 --> 00:19:49,610
no and service whole sentence the broski

569
00:19:49,010 --> 00:19:50,480
got out early

570
00:19:49,610 --> 00:19:52,820
he's now

571
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:54,559
reportedly using his skills concealing

572
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:56,540
fraudulent credit card transactions to

573
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:58,970
help the government cuz evade sanctions

574
00:19:56,540 --> 00:20:01,220
on sanctions banks and some other things

575
00:19:58,970 --> 00:20:02,570
too and you know he was his

576
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:03,830
infrastructure was involved in the

577
00:20:02,570 --> 00:20:05,418
elections hacking so is he now so

578
00:20:03,830 --> 00:20:07,010
powerful he's able to get his revenge I

579
00:20:05,419 --> 00:20:09,020
think the answer is no he's been in this

580
00:20:07,010 --> 00:20:11,510
position for a couple years he's hated

581
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:12,679
these people for a couple years and he

582
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:15,320
hasn't been able to do it until now I

583
00:20:12,679 --> 00:20:16,970
mean to be a leading FSB Division to be

584
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:18,470
a Kaspersky Lab those are important

585
00:20:16,970 --> 00:20:20,600
powerful positions I just don't think

586
00:20:18,470 --> 00:20:23,179
that's enough on its own a lawyer

587
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:24,678
speaking on behalf of stay on earth and

588
00:20:23,179 --> 00:20:25,910
McAuliffe said that they think they

589
00:20:24,679 --> 00:20:28,870
stepped on someone's toes in an

590
00:20:25,910 --> 00:20:31,340
investigation it's possible I don't know

591
00:20:28,870 --> 00:20:33,199
specifics I just know that quote but

592
00:20:31,340 --> 00:20:35,270
it's possible

593
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:37,730
another issue going on is the fact that

594
00:20:35,270 --> 00:20:39,200
treason is a tool that is used in Russia

595
00:20:37,730 --> 00:20:41,450
to have a chilling effect on certain

596
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:43,429
behaviors it is there's actually quite

597
00:20:41,450 --> 00:20:46,340
the treason code is pretty big it says

598
00:20:43,429 --> 00:20:47,840
treason is sharing information with a

599
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:49,490
foreign source against so strategic an

600
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:51,110
interest of the Russian state which

601
00:20:49,490 --> 00:20:52,760
could be almost anything and there's

602
00:20:51,110 --> 00:20:54,678
this pattern of picking someone in a

603
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:57,080
sector trying them with treason and

604
00:20:54,679 --> 00:20:58,549
using that to kill a behavior the sector

605
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:59,928
so there's a radio engineer who applied

606
00:20:58,549 --> 00:21:02,059
for a job abroad got charged with

607
00:20:59,929 --> 00:21:03,500
treason now people with this kind of

608
00:21:02,059 --> 00:21:05,178
knowledge don't apply for jobs abroad

609
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:06,919
there was an air traffic controller who

610
00:21:05,179 --> 00:21:08,929
talked about abroad he taught with

611
00:21:06,919 --> 00:21:10,570
foreigners about air traffic information

612
00:21:08,929 --> 00:21:12,890
that he read in a Russian newspaper

613
00:21:10,570 --> 00:21:14,990
treason charge now no one does that

614
00:21:12,890 --> 00:21:17,270
nuclear engineer talks about research

615
00:21:14,990 --> 00:21:18,020
you know now that's you know one case

616
00:21:17,270 --> 00:21:21,080
charge of treason

617
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:23,720
nobody does that in this case this trip

618
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:26,809
effect this these charges had the effect

619
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:28,340
of killing information sharing amongst

620
00:21:26,809 --> 00:21:30,379
the international information sharing

621
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:32,928
about cyber criminals and that kind of

622
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:35,330
thing so possibly this is a tool to do

623
00:21:32,929 --> 00:21:36,650
that it I do actually have some

624
00:21:35,330 --> 00:21:38,330
statistics I mean treason charges

625
00:21:36,650 --> 00:21:41,090
they've also increases 2014 for example

626
00:21:38,330 --> 00:21:44,960
the newspaper peach lion mask accounted

627
00:21:41,090 --> 00:21:46,879
for cases in 2013 15 in 2014 but overall

628
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:49,850
there's been more than 100 cases since

629
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:52,690
2000 so it's like a pretty common

630
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:54,799
relatively common reuse tool for that

631
00:21:52,690 --> 00:21:56,570
there's also the argument that there's

632
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:57,950
pressure on Kaspersky to reform and

633
00:21:56,570 --> 00:21:59,120
formalize relationships with the winner

634
00:21:57,950 --> 00:22:01,779
of this competition in the state

635
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:03,609
Kaspersky is a very important company

636
00:22:01,779 --> 00:22:06,700
a you know Russia's leading

637
00:22:03,609 --> 00:22:08,678
cybersecurity firm and they are you know

638
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:11,200
they there are no pressure in Russia as

639
00:22:08,679 --> 00:22:12,879
our all tech companies to comply with

640
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:15,219
state interests and doing this kind of

641
00:22:12,879 --> 00:22:17,379
weakens their major ally and puts real

642
00:22:15,219 --> 00:22:18,849
pressure on them to kind of do that so

643
00:22:17,379 --> 00:22:20,199
that could be a benefit but I just don't

644
00:22:18,849 --> 00:22:22,570
think altogether that that was still

645
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:25,419
enough to cause such a dramatic drastic

646
00:22:22,570 --> 00:22:28,779
result so I tried to figure out a bit

647
00:22:25,419 --> 00:22:30,700
more and this is what I could find now I

648
00:22:28,779 --> 00:22:32,139
do want to mention that a lot of this

649
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:34,210
these are all things these are things

650
00:22:32,139 --> 00:22:35,738
people have told me they appear to make

651
00:22:34,210 --> 00:22:37,210
sense they seem plausible some of them

652
00:22:35,739 --> 00:22:38,710
more than others I mean this one's been

653
00:22:37,210 --> 00:22:40,179
in the Russian newspapers so I feel like

654
00:22:38,710 --> 00:22:42,249
it's probably true some of the other

655
00:22:40,179 --> 00:22:43,539
ones are more like things I've heard and

656
00:22:42,249 --> 00:22:45,159
I'll tell you what they are as we go on

657
00:22:43,539 --> 00:22:47,679
but now we're getting into the things I

658
00:22:45,159 --> 00:22:51,339
think I know not things that I'm saying

659
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:53,529
are true but one in fighting the SPF

660
00:22:51,339 --> 00:22:54,639
speed the CIB and the czi as I mentioned

661
00:22:53,529 --> 00:22:57,580
they have areas of overlapping

662
00:22:54,639 --> 00:22:58,988
responsibilities they do compete they

663
00:22:57,580 --> 00:22:59,978
had a competition that they had fun

664
00:22:58,989 --> 00:23:01,960
that's not what it was they had a

665
00:22:59,979 --> 00:23:03,580
conflict there was a deputy director at

666
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:06,279
CIB to meet you private call who had a

667
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:07,559
personal conflict and he was gonna take

668
00:23:06,279 --> 00:23:09,700
his whole department over to the CGI

669
00:23:07,559 --> 00:23:11,830
instead he found himself arrested for

670
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:13,269
taking bribes he was found guilty he had

671
00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:15,009
to resign but he did get to keep his

672
00:23:13,269 --> 00:23:16,899
rank and he had a suspended sentence so

673
00:23:15,009 --> 00:23:18,639
you know someone was protecting him but

674
00:23:16,899 --> 00:23:20,199
shortly after that happened all this

675
00:23:18,639 --> 00:23:22,869
stuff happens so maybe it started with

676
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:24,639
CCI pushing back whatever the result CCI

677
00:23:22,869 --> 00:23:26,799
is now doing really well the head is

678
00:23:24,639 --> 00:23:28,928
just announced he's the head of the FSB

679
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:32,080
his new national cyber defence centre so

680
00:23:28,929 --> 00:23:33,940
possibly that's part of it now this is

681
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:35,978
rumored this one I don't know is true

682
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:38,379
this according to this version of the

683
00:23:35,979 --> 00:23:39,789
story there's a group this section true

684
00:23:38,379 --> 00:23:41,619
there was a group shell Tybalt I they

685
00:23:39,789 --> 00:23:43,929
claim to be hacktivists but they would

686
00:23:41,619 --> 00:23:45,999
mostly hack prominent politicians and

687
00:23:43,929 --> 00:23:48,039
businessmen and demand money not to leak

688
00:23:45,999 --> 00:23:49,599
their information they did compromise

689
00:23:48,039 --> 00:23:51,460
some Russian leadership they did some

690
00:23:49,599 --> 00:23:53,139
pretty damaging leaks they leaked

691
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:54,099
information about Prime Minister mandate

692
00:23:53,139 --> 00:23:56,408
of spending that kicked off

693
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:57,849
anti-corruption protests they may have

694
00:23:56,409 --> 00:24:00,219
been the source for Ukrainian groups

695
00:23:57,849 --> 00:24:02,678
cyber quinta who published proof of

696
00:24:00,219 --> 00:24:03,969
Russian operations and Ukraine's stolen

697
00:24:02,679 --> 00:24:08,440
from the guy running it in Russia

698
00:24:03,969 --> 00:24:09,729
through his office anyway they were

699
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:11,529
arrested around the same time as the

700
00:24:09,729 --> 00:24:12,549
trees and defendants and what's a little

701
00:24:11,529 --> 00:24:13,440
weird about the whole thing is the

702
00:24:12,549 --> 00:24:15,629
leader on UK

703
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:16,980
reportedly cooperating he had really low

704
00:24:15,630 --> 00:24:18,270
charges and he's out already

705
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:20,100
which if he's the leader of this group

706
00:24:18,270 --> 00:24:22,020
and given his targets that's just really

707
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:24,240
surprising so what else is he giving up

708
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:27,480
what else is he doing according to the

709
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:29,130
rumor the CES the FSB agents are fit

710
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:30,840
officers the Colonel's Mikhailovich I

711
00:24:29,130 --> 00:24:32,970
have and I do want to emphasize not stay

712
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:34,740
on over from Genco investigated them

713
00:24:32,970 --> 00:24:36,300
found them and then turn them and we're

714
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:39,660
running them for money and to help their

715
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:41,129
own patron politics the evidence on

716
00:24:39,660 --> 00:24:43,950
behalf of this is the Russian news

717
00:24:41,130 --> 00:24:45,840
portal life news through said that

718
00:24:43,950 --> 00:24:47,370
twelve million dollars in cash had been

719
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:48,600
found in the Kyla's house when it was

720
00:24:47,370 --> 00:24:51,840
circled I guess this apartment when it

721
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:53,790
was searched now a caveat life news is

722
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:55,260
often said to be an FSB outlet and if

723
00:24:53,790 --> 00:24:56,670
there's an intern conflict and

724
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:58,740
interdepartmental comm from the FSB

725
00:24:56,670 --> 00:25:00,990
maybe that's not true maybe it's other

726
00:24:58,740 --> 00:25:03,030
but that's reported so that's kind of

727
00:25:00,990 --> 00:25:04,010
implied that it was Jonathan but that's

728
00:25:03,030 --> 00:25:06,210
it salt they bought their money

729
00:25:04,010 --> 00:25:08,370
complicating the story according to this

730
00:25:06,210 --> 00:25:10,590
version of the rumor one actual shell

731
00:25:08,370 --> 00:25:13,379
Tybalt's eye victim the prominent

732
00:25:10,590 --> 00:25:16,500
oligarch the shirtless man of invested

733
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:18,000
his own investigators on who in who had

734
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:19,980
hacked and laid his information

735
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,630
they found saw that ball time they found

736
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:23,220
McCollum and uncle chuck running it and

737
00:25:21,630 --> 00:25:24,630
they found them doing something else

738
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:27,180
they should not have been doing which

739
00:25:24,630 --> 00:25:29,160
was collaborating in the United States

740
00:25:27,180 --> 00:25:32,130
this would be a household reason if it

741
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:33,510
happened again rumored don't know for

742
00:25:32,130 --> 00:25:35,670
sure this is just you know what they say

743
00:25:33,510 --> 00:25:39,210
in Russia and it does not include staion

744
00:25:35,670 --> 00:25:40,200
of or flamenco but this version of those

745
00:25:39,210 --> 00:25:42,630
couple versions but this version

746
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:44,750
basically assumes that makailah the

747
00:25:42,630 --> 00:25:46,620
levels of infighting are so high that

748
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:49,200
Mikhaylovich Isle were deliberately

749
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:51,239
leaking information to America in order

750
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:54,030
to damage operations of their

751
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:56,460
organizations rivals at home one version

752
00:25:54,030 --> 00:25:58,230
involves internet research agency that's

753
00:25:56,460 --> 00:26:01,080
a better known as the Russian troll

754
00:25:58,230 --> 00:26:02,550
factory they were named in Annie Mueller

755
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:04,139
indictment for trying to impact the

756
00:26:02,550 --> 00:26:05,970
Russia melt the American elections small

757
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:07,320
difference there but the first time that

758
00:26:05,970 --> 00:26:08,940
the names in the Mueller diamond were

759
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:11,520
ever public they were in shell tybalt i

760
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:14,610
leaks so in this version that initially

761
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:17,250
they were targeted as part in order to

762
00:26:14,610 --> 00:26:19,050
help their own mikhailovich i as patrons

763
00:26:17,250 --> 00:26:21,000
and then once they were leaked then it

764
00:26:19,050 --> 00:26:23,520
was used by Mueller that's one version

765
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:25,410
two other versions deliberately and

766
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:26,590
directly look at the idea of the FSB and

767
00:26:25,410 --> 00:26:28,720
GRU infighting

768
00:26:26,590 --> 00:26:30,639
under one it's that McCallum was the

769
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:31,539
source of the carne King service chrono

770
00:26:30,639 --> 00:26:33,758
pay connection

771
00:26:31,539 --> 00:26:36,789
what this is is what this refers to is

772
00:26:33,759 --> 00:26:38,080
king servers was the bulletproof hosting

773
00:26:36,789 --> 00:26:39,580
provider used to compromise some

774
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:41,949
elections resources in the United States

775
00:26:39,580 --> 00:26:43,870
and then it became known that King

776
00:26:41,950 --> 00:26:45,370
servers infrastructure was actually

777
00:26:43,870 --> 00:26:47,649
owned by Corona pay which is the front

778
00:26:45,370 --> 00:26:49,389
company owned by the criminal who keeps

779
00:26:47,649 --> 00:26:50,889
popping up in this probably be of skis

780
00:26:49,389 --> 00:26:54,370
like the Forrest Gump of cybercrime II

781
00:26:50,889 --> 00:26:56,320
just keeps popping up but anyway the and

782
00:26:54,370 --> 00:26:57,639
and someone told like the west about

783
00:26:56,320 --> 00:27:00,610
this someone told threat connect in

784
00:26:57,639 --> 00:27:02,350
America and possibly that was McAuliffe

785
00:27:00,610 --> 00:27:05,080
now it really was chronica

786
00:27:02,350 --> 00:27:06,549
infrastructure and King servers owner of

787
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:08,529
unmanned flamenco and Khurana pay

788
00:27:06,549 --> 00:27:10,840
founder owner

789
00:27:08,529 --> 00:27:12,669
Papa you know II go back really far the

790
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:14,439
desk used to have a criminal forum but

791
00:27:12,669 --> 00:27:16,419
many years ago now and he would you know

792
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:17,649
King sir was advertised on it and when

793
00:27:16,419 --> 00:27:19,059
they released their denials they were

794
00:27:17,649 --> 00:27:22,119
almost verbatim they're still started

795
00:27:19,059 --> 00:27:23,590
talking so that part's real but you know

796
00:27:22,119 --> 00:27:25,269
this this this connection McCallum is

797
00:27:23,590 --> 00:27:27,009
not known and then the bigger one is

798
00:27:25,269 --> 00:27:28,360
that mikail of might have been a source

799
00:27:27,009 --> 00:27:30,369
for the Mueller indictments of the GRU

800
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:32,649
for hacking the DNC and other related

801
00:27:30,369 --> 00:27:35,439
elections resources now the closest I

802
00:27:32,649 --> 00:27:37,479
could come to any kind of attribution is

803
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:38,980
someone giving me a wink nod nod that

804
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:40,269
there was a human source but that

805
00:27:38,980 --> 00:27:42,279
doesn't mean he was McCallum it is

806
00:27:40,269 --> 00:27:43,869
definitely worth mentioning that Russ

807
00:27:42,279 --> 00:27:45,429
bought the official news agency of the

808
00:27:43,869 --> 00:27:48,009
Russian Federation reported that more

809
00:27:45,429 --> 00:27:50,409
than 60 individuals and private

810
00:27:48,009 --> 00:27:53,080
individuals were rated to try to stop G

811
00:27:50,409 --> 00:27:55,299
or leaks about the GRU so like just cuz

812
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:56,590
even if it did happen it doesn't have to

813
00:27:55,299 --> 00:27:58,749
be him and also it is also worth

814
00:27:56,590 --> 00:28:00,340
mentioning they were pretty embarrassing

815
00:27:58,749 --> 00:28:02,649
I mean they had a real impact in America

816
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:05,980
which is serious but you don't need

817
00:28:02,649 --> 00:28:07,149
human resources to track down the actors

818
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:10,809
if you read the indictment like it's

819
00:28:07,149 --> 00:28:14,469
pretty just free so maybe it was maybe

820
00:28:10,809 --> 00:28:15,639
it wasn't so my sanam was lastly on him

821
00:28:14,470 --> 00:28:17,799
he's the head of cybercrime

822
00:28:15,639 --> 00:28:19,418
investigations at Kaspersky he doesn't

823
00:28:17,799 --> 00:28:20,799
show up even in the wildest of rumors

824
00:28:19,419 --> 00:28:22,269
even in things that people are inventing

825
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:23,529
because they know there's fighting and

826
00:28:22,269 --> 00:28:26,409
they don't know where it fits no one

827
00:28:23,529 --> 00:28:27,940
mentions him so why is he here he

828
00:28:26,409 --> 00:28:29,440
released the letter from prison saying

829
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:30,759
that he thinks part of his problem comes

830
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:32,409
from his opposition to working with

831
00:28:30,759 --> 00:28:34,600
primer criminals there was a debate

832
00:28:32,409 --> 00:28:35,830
within the Russian security forces about

833
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:38,139
what they should do about their many

834
00:28:35,830 --> 00:28:38,629
cyber criminals this is after 2014 a 1

835
00:28:38,139 --> 00:28:40,250
him

836
00:28:38,630 --> 00:28:41,390
they're criminals they're willing to

837
00:28:40,250 --> 00:28:44,420
break the law and they could be a

838
00:28:41,390 --> 00:28:45,770
resource and any kind of protests or

839
00:28:44,420 --> 00:28:47,930
opposite of romantic government

840
00:28:45,770 --> 00:28:51,110
opposition activity on the other side

841
00:28:47,930 --> 00:28:52,760
they mostly harm victims in countries

842
00:28:51,110 --> 00:28:53,990
considered rush the strategic rivals and

843
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:56,000
they really do have capabilities that

844
00:28:53,990 --> 00:28:57,770
could be useful Muslim is very much on

845
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:59,390
the side against working with the cyber

846
00:28:57,770 --> 00:29:01,220
criminals and his side lost that debate

847
00:28:59,390 --> 00:29:02,600
and you can see it with the increased

848
00:29:01,220 --> 00:29:04,550
numbers of previously strictly

849
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:06,350
financially motives IRA crime operations

850
00:29:04,550 --> 00:29:08,629
involved either an espionage or some

851
00:29:06,350 --> 00:29:10,909
other state benefiting operation that

852
00:29:08,630 --> 00:29:13,100
doesn't benefit them monetarily so like

853
00:29:10,910 --> 00:29:14,360
that's happening but he thinks maybe he

854
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:16,490
pushed against the wrong people on that

855
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:17,659
and that caused problems another option

856
00:29:16,490 --> 00:29:19,760
as I mentioned there's pressures on

857
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:21,950
Kaspersky Lab to be more collaborative

858
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:25,490
to the United swiff enough with Russia

859
00:29:21,950 --> 00:29:27,410
not the United States a third option is

860
00:29:25,490 --> 00:29:28,940
just he's very well known if you want to

861
00:29:27,410 --> 00:29:30,470
set a chilling effect if you want to say

862
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:31,730
don't cooperate internationally about

863
00:29:30,470 --> 00:29:34,130
these cyber criminals that we now

864
00:29:31,730 --> 00:29:35,540
consider a strategic asset going after

865
00:29:34,130 --> 00:29:36,860
arguably the best-known cyber crime

866
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:38,750
investigator and Russia is a good way to

867
00:29:36,860 --> 00:29:40,760
do it it's a message to sent and it's

868
00:29:38,750 --> 00:29:42,650
also possible he just says bad luck the

869
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:44,330
original conspiracy he's named in it in

870
00:29:42,650 --> 00:29:45,830
2010 because he was at the conference

871
00:29:44,330 --> 00:29:48,500
talking about what a criminal that

872
00:29:45,830 --> 00:29:51,199
Duff's key is and sobieski added him to

873
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:52,670
his conspiracy so once the CIB wants

874
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:54,860
Mikhaylovna stay on it started having

875
00:29:52,670 --> 00:29:57,020
problems it was convenient to pull out

876
00:29:54,860 --> 00:29:58,909
this old conspiracy and like he and then

877
00:29:57,020 --> 00:30:01,220
me we're just in it because we're just

878
00:29:58,910 --> 00:30:02,900
lucky people although he I mean I'm not

879
00:30:01,220 --> 00:30:05,840
I'm much better off than his I don't

880
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:07,310
want to suggest that um but the end

881
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:08,929
result there's some guilty verdicts segi

882
00:30:07,310 --> 00:30:10,280
me Carla I've got 22 years which is two

883
00:30:08,930 --> 00:30:11,600
years over the maximum but technically

884
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:13,820
he committed treason twice because he

885
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:15,020
gave two CDs they said well since Diana

886
00:30:13,820 --> 00:30:16,520
14 years

887
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:18,620
they're both appealing they say they're

888
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:20,210
innocent so kochiya pled guilty although

889
00:30:18,620 --> 00:30:22,070
he's interesting he didn't have guilty

890
00:30:20,210 --> 00:30:24,440
to treason he said he just shared

891
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:26,389
information as is normal in anti

892
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:29,030
cybercrime efforts and he now realizes

893
00:30:26,390 --> 00:30:31,550
that was treason and he's sorry and from

894
00:30:29,030 --> 00:30:33,889
Genco testified for the prosecution he

895
00:30:31,550 --> 00:30:35,570
got seven and then general alexander

896
00:30:33,890 --> 00:30:37,430
grassy mob who was Mikayla's boss at the

897
00:30:35,570 --> 00:30:39,260
FSB he's not powerful he was too

898
00:30:37,430 --> 00:30:42,800
powerful rather to jail but he did have

899
00:30:39,260 --> 00:30:44,450
to resign so lessons learned I really

900
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:45,980
this is a pretty extreme case but I

901
00:30:44,450 --> 00:30:47,570
still think there are some lessons if

902
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:50,780
you're working in the industry and

903
00:30:47,570 --> 00:30:52,250
things you can make one some people just

904
00:30:50,780 --> 00:30:54,350
want to be difficult

905
00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:56,090
I had like some crazy guy online who

906
00:30:54,350 --> 00:30:58,158
confused my Russian ex-boyfriend from

907
00:30:56,090 --> 00:31:00,320
2008 with a cyber criminal has the same

908
00:30:58,159 --> 00:31:01,640
name and was like tweeting and getting

909
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:03,260
his followers to talk about what a

910
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:04,340
Russian slut I am and at first I

911
00:31:03,260 --> 00:31:06,590
couldn't figure out I'm like why am i

912
00:31:04,340 --> 00:31:08,658
Russian is slow what are they doing it's

913
00:31:06,590 --> 00:31:09,820
just and I traced I figured it out but

914
00:31:08,659 --> 00:31:12,320
like it's just people gonna be difficult

915
00:31:09,820 --> 00:31:14,178
the criminal file could be I was ski bro

916
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:16,250
to bonkers medium post in which he said

917
00:31:14,179 --> 00:31:18,140
I'm a CIA agent because my parents live

918
00:31:16,250 --> 00:31:20,600
in the McClane the suburb of McClane

919
00:31:18,140 --> 00:31:23,270
Virginia where the CIA is located they

920
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:25,549
do but it's the major suburb of

921
00:31:23,270 --> 00:31:27,020
Washington DC and it has really good

922
00:31:25,549 --> 00:31:28,580
schools which is why they were there and

923
00:31:27,020 --> 00:31:30,740
oh my dad's Austrian he's like convinced

924
00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:33,020
my dad's some high rank guy in the CIA

925
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:36,049
but he's actually Austrian and can't

926
00:31:33,020 --> 00:31:38,150
even work for America like he also

927
00:31:36,049 --> 00:31:39,620
ported like music quote lyrics about me

928
00:31:38,150 --> 00:31:42,320
and how I tame elephants it was just

929
00:31:39,620 --> 00:31:43,820
bonkers but and then the how the good

930
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:44,870
guys are good sometimes I mean II get it

931
00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:46,520
wrong sometimes they do it on purpose

932
00:31:44,870 --> 00:31:48,260
but like poverty Bielski again

933
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:50,360
established criminal you can google him

934
00:31:48,260 --> 00:31:51,679
clearly a criminal he would give quotes

935
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:53,449
as a businessman with knowledge of the

936
00:31:51,679 --> 00:31:54,559
case and they would write it or they

937
00:31:53,450 --> 00:31:55,970
would get things wrong they were right

938
00:31:54,559 --> 00:31:58,549
that I really am an agent or they would

939
00:31:55,970 --> 00:32:00,230
write that my ex-boyfriend from 2008 is

940
00:31:58,549 --> 00:32:03,320
actually my husband which was news to my

941
00:32:00,230 --> 00:32:04,580
actual husband or were they also love it

942
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:05,840
they would add years to our relationship

943
00:32:04,580 --> 00:32:07,939
so my husband's like when you were gonna

944
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:13,039
Russia it says you were dating him but

945
00:32:07,940 --> 00:32:14,390
you were dating me I'm like no no no I

946
00:32:13,039 --> 00:32:15,470
don't think that was malicious but once

947
00:32:14,390 --> 00:32:18,919
they get it wrong then it gets repeated

948
00:32:15,470 --> 00:32:20,630
and then it's out there sometimes they

949
00:32:18,919 --> 00:32:22,340
know I had some particular problems this

950
00:32:20,630 --> 00:32:25,159
is story of how Brian Krebs got the FSB

951
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:27,320
to search my apartment Brian Krebs knew

952
00:32:25,159 --> 00:32:29,330
about this he's a tech journalist here

953
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:31,549
if those you don't know he knew about

954
00:32:29,330 --> 00:32:34,220
the whole espionage conspiracy back in

955
00:32:31,549 --> 00:32:36,650
2010 because I told him once I find out

956
00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:37,850
he's one of his deputies actually sent

957
00:32:36,650 --> 00:32:40,010
me all the documents trying to lure me

958
00:32:37,850 --> 00:32:41,959
in I told him I shared them with him I

959
00:32:40,010 --> 00:32:42,679
knew he was working on Khurana pay I was

960
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:44,179
trying to be helpful

961
00:32:42,679 --> 00:32:46,580
I gave him stuff lots of people did I

962
00:32:44,179 --> 00:32:48,590
wasn't his only source but you know and

963
00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:50,928
I thought it was being helpful and then

964
00:32:48,590 --> 00:32:51,918
what does he do he writes an articles to

965
00:32:50,929 --> 00:32:54,260
me she learns about the trees in the

966
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:57,530
rest I look he can see it up there but I

967
00:32:54,260 --> 00:32:58,070
had to bend over see it here sorry he

968
00:32:57,530 --> 00:32:59,799
said that

969
00:32:58,070 --> 00:33:02,030
he wrote the book about Dubrowski

970
00:32:59,799 --> 00:33:03,629
because he had a lot of Records and he

971
00:33:02,030 --> 00:33:05,100
was able to do it the

972
00:33:03,630 --> 00:33:07,620
someone in Russia and law enforcement

973
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:08,428
had leaked them to him to Brian Krebs

974
00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:10,469
and the FBI

975
00:33:08,429 --> 00:33:11,820
now there were information I mentioned

976
00:33:10,470 --> 00:33:13,620
it there was lots of documents about

977
00:33:11,820 --> 00:33:15,600
Khurana pay online but my understanding

978
00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:17,280
was that it was coming from his criminal

979
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:19,110
business partner not the Russian

980
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:20,580
government and once their post online

981
00:33:19,110 --> 00:33:21,780
I don't know how Brian Krebs would know

982
00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:24,389
where they came from or how they knew

983
00:33:21,780 --> 00:33:25,740
the FBI got them to and the next line he

984
00:33:24,390 --> 00:33:27,690
writes to this day I don't know the

985
00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:29,010
source so he doesn't know but what

986
00:33:27,690 --> 00:33:30,750
happens after this is published is the

987
00:33:29,010 --> 00:33:32,730
next day the FSB searches my apartment

988
00:33:30,750 --> 00:33:35,340
in Moscow takes my TV takes my printer

989
00:33:32,730 --> 00:33:36,510
takes the tablet of the daughter of the

990
00:33:35,340 --> 00:33:38,389
pointings who was staying there while I

991
00:33:36,510 --> 00:33:40,860
was in Germany being busy having a baby

992
00:33:38,390 --> 00:33:44,159
and then you know not getting arrested

993
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:47,370
for espionage uh-huh and then also this

994
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:48,770
was used in Russia as proof that look

995
00:33:47,370 --> 00:33:51,120
like you know this well-known

996
00:33:48,770 --> 00:33:52,679
journalists is confirming that all this

997
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:54,840
happened and when I asked him to change

998
00:33:52,679 --> 00:33:56,250
it I asked him a lot to clarify this is

999
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:57,570
you don't know please clarify he

1000
00:33:56,250 --> 00:33:59,520
wouldn't do it and I have the

1001
00:33:57,570 --> 00:34:00,928
screenshots he basically said Ruslan I'm

1002
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:02,850
screwed anyway so it doesn't really

1003
00:34:00,929 --> 00:34:04,530
matter what he does so it's not doing

1004
00:34:02,850 --> 00:34:07,740
anything so now I'm sorry I ever helped

1005
00:34:04,530 --> 00:34:09,270
him into that lesson second can you

1006
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:11,790
trust Group IB rule might be is a

1007
00:34:09,270 --> 00:34:13,739
cybersecurity firm it's often held up as

1008
00:34:11,790 --> 00:34:16,020
an alternative Kaspersky after Kaspersky

1009
00:34:13,739 --> 00:34:17,399
had it scandals but what are they kind

1010
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:19,230
of interesting things is why all this

1011
00:34:17,399 --> 00:34:20,969
was happening they were working for

1012
00:34:19,230 --> 00:34:23,310
Khurana thing which is the front company

1013
00:34:20,969 --> 00:34:25,589
of Papa Panov ski the conference where I

1014
00:34:23,310 --> 00:34:27,509
was at we're group I be CEO idiot such

1015
00:34:25,590 --> 00:34:29,159
Cove was at and well Ruslan slay autumn

1016
00:34:27,510 --> 00:34:31,290
was at we were all talking about what a

1017
00:34:29,159 --> 00:34:34,889
criminal vbf ski is took place in

1018
00:34:31,290 --> 00:34:37,770
October 2010 that article it's Russian

1019
00:34:34,889 --> 00:34:40,109
but it's from December 2010 and it talks

1020
00:34:37,770 --> 00:34:42,000
about work that who PI B is doing for

1021
00:34:40,109 --> 00:34:43,619
chrono pay they got hacked another time

1022
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,879
and group IB said it's fine and the

1023
00:34:43,619 --> 00:34:47,669
company is fine and you can trust them

1024
00:34:44,879 --> 00:34:50,399
so it's absolute worse or absolute best

1025
00:34:47,668 --> 00:34:51,960
they have extremely bad judgment and at

1026
00:34:50,399 --> 00:34:54,179
the absolute worst someone from the

1027
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:55,859
conference gave your blow of ski the

1028
00:34:54,179 --> 00:34:59,100
attendees list which he used to try to

1029
00:34:55,859 --> 00:35:00,869
friend everyone on LinkedIn and it also

1030
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:02,040
is how the hrabosky knew that was some

1031
00:35:00,869 --> 00:35:03,330
sign of and I were talking about what

1032
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:05,460
criminals they are started the whole

1033
00:35:03,330 --> 00:35:07,230
thing I don't actually know where it

1034
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:09,000
came from but given all this stuff like

1035
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:11,010
that's I put a question mark on it and

1036
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:13,050
you show some I mean judge was not good

1037
00:35:11,010 --> 00:35:15,420
at the word at the best so I would say

1038
00:35:13,050 --> 00:35:17,180
him so listen there are some other

1039
00:35:15,420 --> 00:35:18,890
lessons learned I mean some people

1040
00:35:17,180 --> 00:35:20,180
we'll surprise you I work with some

1041
00:35:18,890 --> 00:35:22,190
emeritus Pope with some American

1042
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:24,379
journalists who I had a very good

1043
00:35:22,190 --> 00:35:26,539
experience with joseph menn son Reuters

1044
00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:28,609
Patrick gray from risky business I got

1045
00:35:26,539 --> 00:35:29,839
the impression that both of them were

1046
00:35:28,609 --> 00:35:31,940
trying to figure out what was happening

1047
00:35:29,839 --> 00:35:34,940
they weren't trying to just get some

1048
00:35:31,940 --> 00:35:36,559
sexy Russian hacking story and I also

1049
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:38,000
got the impression that they had some

1050
00:35:36,559 --> 00:35:38,809
level of care for me and what was

1051
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,339
happening to me

1052
00:35:38,809 --> 00:35:42,650
and we're not just trying to get her

1053
00:35:40,339 --> 00:35:44,240
story and you know like I had one woman

1054
00:35:42,650 --> 00:35:45,770
just like publish all kinds of things

1055
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:47,180
that aren't true I complain to her and

1056
00:35:45,770 --> 00:35:49,339
she was like no one has more respected

1057
00:35:47,180 --> 00:35:51,710
resources than me like these were the

1058
00:35:49,339 --> 00:35:52,940
exact opposite of that I also had a very

1059
00:35:51,710 --> 00:35:54,470
positive experience with some Russian

1060
00:35:52,940 --> 00:35:56,119
journalists I mean a lot of the stuff

1061
00:35:54,470 --> 00:35:57,859
that I started with I started with them

1062
00:35:56,119 --> 00:36:00,529
as the original leads to try to track it

1063
00:35:57,859 --> 00:36:01,880
down and I think there the situation is

1064
00:36:00,529 --> 00:36:03,920
they kind understand like this is my

1065
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:06,980
life just consequences so they're a

1066
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:08,480
little more open but you know and then

1067
00:36:06,980 --> 00:36:09,740
the FBI the irony this is Christine are

1068
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:11,180
not agents so I don't know these people

1069
00:36:09,740 --> 00:36:13,578
but once this happened the FBI actually

1070
00:36:11,180 --> 00:36:14,899
came and wanted to know like am i okay

1071
00:36:13,579 --> 00:36:16,549
our Russian agents trying to reach out

1072
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:19,640
to me and actually a very positive

1073
00:36:16,549 --> 00:36:22,730
experience with them also all your plans

1074
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:26,058
may not be enough I tried very hard to

1075
00:36:22,730 --> 00:36:27,319
not ever say anything that could be used

1076
00:36:26,059 --> 00:36:28,609
against me by someone trying to cause

1077
00:36:27,319 --> 00:36:30,380
trouble in Russia I was aware of the

1078
00:36:28,609 --> 00:36:31,670
situation there I didn't really have a

1079
00:36:30,380 --> 00:36:34,279
plan for what to do when they just make

1080
00:36:31,670 --> 00:36:36,079
it up entirely also your broader

1081
00:36:34,279 --> 00:36:38,150
networks risks are also your risk again

1082
00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:39,619
I don't I know who make I live in the

1083
00:36:38,150 --> 00:36:41,000
kochiya var because once you're accused

1084
00:36:39,619 --> 00:36:43,099
of being in an espionage ring with them

1085
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:45,829
you bother to find out who they are but

1086
00:36:43,099 --> 00:36:47,630
I don't actually know them I tried very

1087
00:36:45,829 --> 00:36:48,950
hard to stay away from officials

1088
00:36:47,630 --> 00:36:50,270
anything that could make me look like I

1089
00:36:48,950 --> 00:36:52,399
was a spy I'm just focusing on my

1090
00:36:50,270 --> 00:36:54,109
criminals breaking Russian law that was

1091
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:55,400
it but of course I never since they Anna

1092
00:36:54,109 --> 00:36:57,259
was since they I know work with them

1093
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:59,000
then their problems became my problems

1094
00:36:57,260 --> 00:37:01,520
and good work can be trouble

1095
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:03,529
um it is real trouble and it is

1096
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:04,970
unfortunate but I'm still I think it's

1097
00:37:03,529 --> 00:37:06,710
good I think it's worth it I think this

1098
00:37:04,970 --> 00:37:09,709
whole sector is hugely important I'm

1099
00:37:06,710 --> 00:37:11,000
very proud to be a part of it and you

1100
00:37:09,710 --> 00:37:15,020
know I'm glad to see black hats here and

1101
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:16,339
everyone's doing so well and the black

1102
00:37:15,020 --> 00:37:18,109
hat asked me to do some sound bites so

1103
00:37:16,339 --> 00:37:19,578
here are my basic sound bites in

1104
00:37:18,109 --> 00:37:22,160
fighting among Russian security services

1105
00:37:19,579 --> 00:37:24,200
is increasing this drives riskier and

1106
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:25,670
more aggressive action abroad and it is

1107
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:27,200
scudder discourages international

1108
00:37:25,670 --> 00:37:30,619
cooperation and dialogue which makes all

1109
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:33,120
of us less safe the end

1110
00:37:30,619 --> 00:37:36,290
questions

1111
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:36,290
[Applause]

1112
00:37:41,030 --> 00:37:45,490
I'm also supposed to say if you have any

1113
00:37:43,070 --> 00:37:51,950
questions please stand there and there

1114
00:37:45,490 --> 00:37:54,859
but alright the end oh you have a

1115
00:37:51,950 --> 00:37:56,089
question yeah oh I don't I don't

1116
00:37:54,859 --> 00:37:57,470
actually know either I can't see with

1117
00:37:56,090 --> 00:38:02,140
the lights there like there and there

1118
00:37:57,470 --> 00:38:02,140
somewhere I'm sorry alright just shout I

1119
00:38:05,170 --> 00:38:11,270
have no IDE I honestly don't know about

1120
00:38:09,619 --> 00:38:13,730
that I know what I've heard I know what

1121
00:38:11,270 --> 00:38:15,320
other people have heard I guess the

1122
00:38:13,730 --> 00:38:16,640
average person is probably fine even if

1123
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:17,750
they are working in the government you

1124
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:19,940
don't have what they care about there's

1125
00:38:17,750 --> 00:38:22,460
gonna do their job but I honestly like I

1126
00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:26,990
don't know about the nature that

1127
00:38:22,460 --> 00:38:28,640
cooperation yes no but I mean I also

1128
00:38:26,990 --> 00:38:28,939
have an employer I just I use what they

1129
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:48,950
give me

1130
00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:50,359
I mean yes I mean the role of

1131
00:38:48,950 --> 00:38:51,859
cybersecurity within like Russia and

1132
00:38:50,359 --> 00:38:54,140
understanding of the strategic security

1133
00:38:51,859 --> 00:38:55,400
is huge it is I mean it first of all

1134
00:38:54,140 --> 00:38:56,690
it's just a global phenomenon it would

1135
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:58,400
be odd if it's not happening there but

1136
00:38:56,690 --> 00:38:59,630
it's huge and because it's so important

1137
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:00,859
that's part of why there's in fighting

1138
00:38:59,630 --> 00:39:03,380
now is because the people in the

1139
00:39:00,859 --> 00:39:04,640
security services want to get as much of

1140
00:39:03,380 --> 00:39:07,369
a foothold as they can in this

1141
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:08,839
incredibly important sector and I think

1142
00:39:07,369 --> 00:39:10,099
the thing is you have to do it if you're

1143
00:39:08,839 --> 00:39:11,390
there because if you don't you arrive as

1144
00:39:10,099 --> 00:39:14,030
well and then they'll use that to crush

1145
00:39:11,390 --> 00:39:16,339
you okay I have a question right here

1146
00:39:14,030 --> 00:39:18,500
yes you mentioned that there's

1147
00:39:16,339 --> 00:39:20,570
increasing in could you say I don't hear

1148
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:22,339
very well I assure you mentioned that

1149
00:39:20,570 --> 00:39:24,020
there's increasing infighting among

1150
00:39:22,339 --> 00:39:25,279
different governments what are some of

1151
00:39:24,020 --> 00:39:27,619
the other governments that have

1152
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:30,380
increased in fighting in the cyber

1153
00:39:27,619 --> 00:39:31,670
sphere or otherwise I'm sorry I didn't

1154
00:39:30,380 --> 00:39:32,930
mean to say that was increased in

1155
00:39:31,670 --> 00:39:35,089
fighting and other governments I just

1156
00:39:32,930 --> 00:39:36,950
mean to say that like it's not it exists

1157
00:39:35,089 --> 00:39:39,140
in other governments it's not unique to

1158
00:39:36,950 --> 00:39:41,540
Russia that it exists what is you need

1159
00:39:39,140 --> 00:39:43,848
to Russia or you know not norm not

1160
00:39:41,540 --> 00:39:46,759
amongst the norm is how intense the

1161
00:39:43,849 --> 00:39:48,859
infighting is and how much more intense

1162
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:50,089
it has become so I don't have like

1163
00:39:48,859 --> 00:39:51,799
another country that's doing the same

1164
00:39:50,089 --> 00:39:54,770
thing that's why I think this is special

1165
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:56,720
yes I think I said sure

1166
00:39:54,770 --> 00:40:00,080
right Iran there they're probably

1167
00:39:56,720 --> 00:40:02,689
actually crazier hi Kim I've actually

1168
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:04,850
previously interviewed you for a story I

1169
00:40:02,690 --> 00:40:06,680
wrote for crypto coins news about the

1170
00:40:04,850 --> 00:40:08,360
Mihaylov trial I don't think that you

1171
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:10,310
really liked some of my coverage so much

1172
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:11,750
I don't know because you said it was a

1173
00:40:10,310 --> 00:40:13,220
legitimate actor he's not he's a

1174
00:40:11,750 --> 00:40:14,870
criminal gone to jail and is like

1175
00:40:13,220 --> 00:40:16,459
actively collaborating with multiple

1176
00:40:14,870 --> 00:40:18,529
operations I don't think I ever framed

1177
00:40:16,460 --> 00:40:22,220
him as legitimate act right I

1178
00:40:18,530 --> 00:40:25,340
highlighted his criminal past I I wanted

1179
00:40:22,220 --> 00:40:30,770
to ask you about so I wrote whatever

1180
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:32,000
awkward weird like this but I'm like

1181
00:40:30,770 --> 00:40:35,540
blinded by the light I'm just trying to

1182
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:37,610
see you know it's cool um so as you know

1183
00:40:35,540 --> 00:40:40,310
I wrote about the btc-e crypto

1184
00:40:37,610 --> 00:40:42,410
laundering scandal and in Russia there's

1185
00:40:40,310 --> 00:40:43,520
a lot of chatter that and it's been it's

1186
00:40:42,410 --> 00:40:45,049
been picked up I mean it could be

1187
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:46,490
disinformation but it's been picked up

1188
00:40:45,050 --> 00:40:48,740
in media outlets a lot of people have

1189
00:40:46,490 --> 00:40:50,569
said it at least four or five you know

1190
00:40:48,740 --> 00:40:53,270
high-profile people in the crypto space

1191
00:40:50,570 --> 00:40:55,730
that btc-e towards the end of its

1192
00:40:53,270 --> 00:40:59,480
lifecycle was actually under the thumb

1193
00:40:55,730 --> 00:41:00,980
of mihailov that that that the exchange

1194
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:02,480
administrator you know he was kind of

1195
00:41:00,980 --> 00:41:06,140
overseeing the whole operation have you

1196
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:08,030
heard that I read some stuff I couldn't

1197
00:41:06,140 --> 00:41:10,160
find anyone in Russia who was willing to

1198
00:41:08,030 --> 00:41:12,050
like that I was opinion I would trust he

1199
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:14,660
was willing to say anything about it so

1200
00:41:12,050 --> 00:41:17,570
I like I just that just that chart is

1201
00:41:14,660 --> 00:41:20,120
the summary version it is so complicated

1202
00:41:17,570 --> 00:41:22,010
I couldn't put everything in there

1203
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:23,270
I just couldn't like I just had to stick

1204
00:41:22,010 --> 00:41:24,890
to the big stuff I'm sorry you were

1205
00:41:23,270 --> 00:41:26,630
actually an office one guy who's Paul

1206
00:41:24,890 --> 00:41:28,069
he's pretty big dealers a founder of the

1207
00:41:26,630 --> 00:41:29,630
safe internet League in Russia and he's

1208
00:41:28,070 --> 00:41:31,550
gone he's publicly said it like on

1209
00:41:29,630 --> 00:41:35,750
Facebook posts that he left it everybody

1210
00:41:31,550 --> 00:41:37,190
did yeah okay thanks sorry I don't

1211
00:41:35,750 --> 00:41:38,510
actually something I'm not actually an

1212
00:41:37,190 --> 00:41:41,570
agent this would be so much easier if I

1213
00:41:38,510 --> 00:41:44,960
were real spy so I don't actually know

1214
00:41:41,570 --> 00:41:47,570
everything I'm sympathetic to that my

1215
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:49,130
name is Renee I wanted to ask what's

1216
00:41:47,570 --> 00:41:53,450
your sense of coordination between IRA

1217
00:41:49,130 --> 00:41:55,940
and GRU well right now we're getting

1218
00:41:53,450 --> 00:41:58,850
into some all right how do I get this in

1219
00:41:55,940 --> 00:42:01,010
place so IRA is most famously at linked

1220
00:41:58,850 --> 00:42:03,319
to Vic on Putin's chef Cleveland ypres

1221
00:42:01,010 --> 00:42:05,210
Gordon who is he gets that name because

1222
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:06,650
among on the many things he has some

1223
00:42:05,210 --> 00:42:08,369
catering contracts with the government

1224
00:42:06,650 --> 00:42:10,319
some very high levels he

1225
00:42:08,369 --> 00:42:12,990
also does things like run a mercenary

1226
00:42:10,319 --> 00:42:14,670
company that's been active in Syria he

1227
00:42:12,990 --> 00:42:17,669
does appear to have some military like

1228
00:42:14,670 --> 00:42:19,200
overlaps and some ties but I don't I

1229
00:42:17,670 --> 00:42:20,880
mean like given the internal mechanisms

1230
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:21,720
of those guys that that gets out of the

1231
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:23,099
cyber sphere so I haven't actually

1232
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:24,990
looked into it I can just say like

1233
00:42:23,099 --> 00:42:27,869
looking at his operations in both

1234
00:42:24,990 --> 00:42:29,069
Ukraine and Syria and other places like

1235
00:42:27,869 --> 00:42:31,049
some of them went to I believe in

1236
00:42:29,069 --> 00:42:32,759
Venezuela I wouldn't be surprised if

1237
00:42:31,049 --> 00:42:35,609
there was some level overlap but I don't

1238
00:42:32,759 --> 00:42:37,519
know curious more about the I know the

1239
00:42:35,609 --> 00:42:39,660
backstory quite well the the

1240
00:42:37,519 --> 00:42:42,299
coordination around hack and week versus

1241
00:42:39,660 --> 00:42:43,558
socialize I'm sorry I'm interest I

1242
00:42:42,299 --> 00:42:44,940
didn't hear a while I'm sorry the

1243
00:42:43,559 --> 00:42:46,920
coordination between hack and week

1244
00:42:44,940 --> 00:42:49,859
versus socialized hack & league vs.

1245
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:51,450
dissemination channel this is get as far

1246
00:42:49,859 --> 00:42:54,359
as hacking and I can't hear more impact

1247
00:42:51,450 --> 00:42:59,249
and leak versus I can leak dissemination

1248
00:42:54,359 --> 00:43:00,328
channels yeah overlap I mean look at

1249
00:42:59,249 --> 00:43:01,769
this stuff that was hacking League from

1250
00:43:00,329 --> 00:43:03,420
the US if you look at the people trying

1251
00:43:01,769 --> 00:43:05,490
to do it it was the GRU it was an

1252
00:43:03,420 --> 00:43:06,420
internet research agency and actually I

1253
00:43:05,490 --> 00:43:07,529
think that does go back to the

1254
00:43:06,420 --> 00:43:08,609
infighting that you know once they had

1255
00:43:07,529 --> 00:43:10,440
it internally they didn't want to give

1256
00:43:08,609 --> 00:43:11,848
it up and once they were named which I

1257
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:14,249
also don't think they were expecting if

1258
00:43:11,849 --> 00:43:15,869
you look at their attempted response it

1259
00:43:14,249 --> 00:43:17,368
was very poor in the beginning and I got

1260
00:43:15,869 --> 00:43:18,420
better over time I think if they realize

1261
00:43:17,369 --> 00:43:19,380
they were struggling and brought another

1262
00:43:18,420 --> 00:43:21,749
people because they were still trying to

1263
00:43:19,380 --> 00:43:23,809
handle it in-house that's what I think

1264
00:43:21,749 --> 00:43:23,808
anyway

1265
00:43:25,609 --> 00:43:32,759
yeah to your charge because they're not

1266
00:43:31,170 --> 00:43:34,140
really as prominent in all the reports

1267
00:43:32,759 --> 00:43:35,130
about competition and infighting I

1268
00:43:34,140 --> 00:43:36,598
thought about putting them in there

1269
00:43:35,130 --> 00:43:37,829
because obviously they're looking for an

1270
00:43:36,599 --> 00:43:41,220
intelligence agency they're important

1271
00:43:37,829 --> 00:43:42,539
but they're not as when you hear about

1272
00:43:41,220 --> 00:43:43,769
the competition and the fighting what

1273
00:43:42,539 --> 00:43:45,239
people are doing to damage each other

1274
00:43:43,769 --> 00:43:46,828
you don't hear about them so much

1275
00:43:45,239 --> 00:43:48,660
I mean they've actually been accused of

1276
00:43:46,829 --> 00:43:50,549
also conducting you know attacks in the

1277
00:43:48,660 --> 00:43:52,950
US elections resources they are an

1278
00:43:50,549 --> 00:43:54,930
intelligence agency who spy on people

1279
00:43:52,950 --> 00:43:56,249
and steal things so they're there but

1280
00:43:54,930 --> 00:43:57,598
they're just not Justin I left them out

1281
00:43:56,249 --> 00:43:59,160
I left out some other ones too because

1282
00:43:57,599 --> 00:44:02,960
they're not as aggressive in the whole

1283
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:07,319
inviting story okay one last question

1284
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:10,920
basically now you said that FSB lost the

1285
00:44:07,319 --> 00:44:13,859
fight right GRU now is in power sorry no

1286
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:15,630
I didn't I didn't okay who has who's now

1287
00:44:13,859 --> 00:44:16,680
has more consolidation in power over

1288
00:44:15,630 --> 00:44:18,240
the other end those two aside I'm

1289
00:44:16,680 --> 00:44:19,830
probably my money would be on the FSB

1290
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:24,419
that giryu is that a lot is that a bad

1291
00:44:19,830 --> 00:44:28,009
year so an FSB did just get the national

1292
00:44:24,420 --> 00:44:28,010
cyber defence centre is an indication

1293
00:44:28,910 --> 00:44:35,279
thank you a nice presentation a quick

1294
00:44:32,790 --> 00:44:39,990
question about your CrowdStrike

1295
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:42,900
attribution for the dnc hack do you have

1296
00:44:39,990 --> 00:44:46,589
any knowledge that CrowdStrike

1297
00:44:42,900 --> 00:44:49,950
shared their forensic data with anyone

1298
00:44:46,590 --> 00:44:53,790
else because we know no intelligence

1299
00:44:49,950 --> 00:44:54,899
agency looked at it how are we trusting

1300
00:44:53,790 --> 00:44:56,310
CrowdStrike

1301
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:57,540
well for starters the Intelligence

1302
00:44:56,310 --> 00:44:58,620
Agency didn't do it they didn't get it

1303
00:44:57,540 --> 00:44:59,340
from crowd story because they looked at

1304
00:44:58,620 --> 00:45:01,140
it themselves

1305
00:44:59,340 --> 00:45:02,670
the reason heart strike was used is

1306
00:45:01,140 --> 00:45:04,049
because they're able to discuss it much

1307
00:45:02,670 --> 00:45:06,570
more publicly so they brought in like a

1308
00:45:04,050 --> 00:45:08,490
private party to be able to make it

1309
00:45:06,570 --> 00:45:10,110
public so I don't actually doesn't

1310
00:45:08,490 --> 00:45:12,540
actually worry me that no word in the

1311
00:45:10,110 --> 00:45:13,620
Intel you don't know if anyone in the US

1312
00:45:12,540 --> 00:45:16,230
intelligence that you've seen the

1313
00:45:13,620 --> 00:45:18,779
CrowdStrike forensics records or not but

1314
00:45:16,230 --> 00:45:21,180
see that's correct it doesn't know it

1315
00:45:18,780 --> 00:45:22,440
doesn't bother me because the purpose of

1316
00:45:21,180 --> 00:45:24,060
bringing and CrowdStrike was not to be

1317
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:25,410
the only investigator I mean I know for

1318
00:45:24,060 --> 00:45:27,270
a fact that there was a very severe in

1319
00:45:25,410 --> 00:45:27,720
serious investigation conducted by a US

1320
00:45:27,270 --> 00:45:29,670
agency

1321
00:45:27,720 --> 00:45:31,290
what crowd strikes purpose was to have

1322
00:45:29,670 --> 00:45:34,910
an outside private source that could

1323
00:45:31,290 --> 00:45:37,830
publicly discuss it so you know of no

1324
00:45:34,910 --> 00:45:41,129
sharing of crowd strikes forensics with

1325
00:45:37,830 --> 00:45:44,870
any other security fraud strike does not

1326
00:45:41,130 --> 00:45:46,860
tell me about their business okay thanks

1327
00:45:44,870 --> 00:45:48,060
sorry I know like real weird like this

1328
00:45:46,860 --> 00:45:49,530
but I'm just trying to get the light out

1329
00:45:48,060 --> 00:45:54,330
of my eyes I can see people as they talk

1330
00:45:49,530 --> 00:45:56,970
to me you had mentioned that there's

1331
00:45:54,330 --> 00:45:59,819
increase in fighting and stressors and

1332
00:45:56,970 --> 00:46:01,500
basically cyber crime investigation in

1333
00:45:59,820 --> 00:46:03,120
Russia is heating up what do you think

1334
00:46:01,500 --> 00:46:04,440
the future for that is do you think it

1335
00:46:03,120 --> 00:46:06,810
will continue to escalate or do you

1336
00:46:04,440 --> 00:46:09,300
think it might temper alright thank you

1337
00:46:06,810 --> 00:46:11,610
yes I think given that I mean right now

1338
00:46:09,300 --> 00:46:13,590
the domestic pressures in Russia are not

1339
00:46:11,610 --> 00:46:15,000
gonna get better they get worse and the

1340
00:46:13,590 --> 00:46:16,920
political uncertainty about Russia's

1341
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:19,710
future is not getting better so as long

1342
00:46:16,920 --> 00:46:22,520
as those two are there then I feel like

1343
00:46:19,710 --> 00:46:22,520
there's no reason I would stop

1344
00:46:25,190 --> 00:46:28,030
you're welcome

1345
00:46:28,430 --> 00:46:31,770
[Applause]
