1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,740
all right good morning everybody welcome

2
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:07,080
to South Seas a ve hopefully you are

3
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:09,840
here for battle of Windows service a

4
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:13,080
silver bullet to discover file privilege

5
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:14,639
escalation bugs automatically I am dr.

6
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:17,180
John Griffin and it is my great pleasure

7
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:19,640
to introduce wind Chu

8
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:22,980
before we begin a couple of brief notes

9
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:26,160
first stop by the business hall located

10
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:29,160
in Mandalay Bay Oceanside and shoreline

11
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:31,560
ballrooms on level 2 during the day and

12
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:34,950
for the welcome reception tonight at

13
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:37,620
5:30 the blackhat Arsenal is in the

14
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:41,700
business hall on level 2 we're on level

15
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:45,209
3 I believe and join us at 1830 6:30

16
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:49,530
p.m. for the Pawnee Awards in lagoon G H

17
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:52,050
I we'd appreciate if you would put all

18
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:53,940
of your mobile devices on silent we're

19
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:55,199
recording the talk and so if there's too

20
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:56,640
many interruptions we'll have to lock

21
00:00:55,199 --> 00:01:00,690
the doors and start again from scratch

22
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:05,909
and you'll miss lunch which is at 12:05

23
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:15,509
advice Bayside a B let's do it

24
00:01:05,909 --> 00:01:16,229
where's you come on up good money thanks

25
00:01:15,509 --> 00:01:18,299
for coming

26
00:01:16,229 --> 00:01:21,299
I'm going shoe from ten cents to

27
00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:23,790
traditional lab ten cents is the name of

28
00:01:21,299 --> 00:01:28,280
a company so nobody works for one in 10

29
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:28,280
cents this is not enough for sushi right

30
00:01:28,490 --> 00:01:34,020
Tenten is also a largest social media

31
00:01:31,259 --> 00:01:36,000
entertainment company in China and Tesla

32
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:39,240
secretion will have is known in focus on

33
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:42,360
applied security and real world security

34
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:45,750
research I'm a member of advance the

35
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:48,149
security team we are I'm previously

36
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:50,430
doing web applications security before

37
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:55,259
but now I'm interested in logical bug

38
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:58,500
hunting so this talk is based on Windows

39
00:01:55,259 --> 00:02:01,860
10 and with your studio orbit abilities

40
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:05,729
has been reported to nsrc so I'm sure no

41
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:08,580
zero taste will be brought and several

42
00:02:05,729 --> 00:02:13,260
new paths I will be releasing after this

43
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:13,870
presentation so this is a lie and

44
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:16,480
forestry

45
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:18,760
reduce what's new in this talk and then

46
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:21,760
we'll do some case studies and introduce

47
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:28,959
the silver ballot to discover new Paris

48
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:31,540
and build a discovery framework so what

49
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:35,470
is the logical privileges creation bags

50
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:37,540
oh that's no the restrictive user could

51
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:41,079
communicate with a system service

52
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:43,810
through our PC or come or some other

53
00:02:41,079 --> 00:02:45,790
ways and the system service would do

54
00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:51,459
some operations such as fire operations

55
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:54,959
history or general operations and fair

56
00:02:51,459 --> 00:02:58,120
and when we do fire operations include

57
00:02:54,959 --> 00:03:03,400
grant access or say the owner or to do

58
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:06,640
some create delete read file and then I

59
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:09,400
want to say muscle bags in the RPC

60
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:12,879
servers today I haven't talked about so

61
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:15,579
let's say restricted user need to use

62
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:20,380
protocol sequences to communicate data

63
00:03:15,579 --> 00:03:24,819
RPC service there there are actually

64
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:28,299
five kind of protocol sequences for for

65
00:03:24,819 --> 00:03:33,970
he to use actually the most important

66
00:03:28,299 --> 00:03:39,160
one is a LPC which is NCL RPC so let's

67
00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:43,090
see how it works when we analyze the LPC

68
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:46,389
interfaces we first use a tuning name

69
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:49,750
RPC viewer it could reverse the

70
00:03:46,389 --> 00:03:52,269
interface to ideal code and then we

71
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:56,440
could analyze the relate the do file

72
00:03:52,269 --> 00:03:58,359
using Ida Pro and use process monitor to

73
00:03:56,440 --> 00:04:04,840
detect if there is a sensitive

74
00:03:58,359 --> 00:04:06,819
operations so what's new in this book we

75
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:09,810
all know there are too many interfaces

76
00:04:06,819 --> 00:04:12,458
in LPC to be analyzed

77
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:15,639
actually there are hundreds of them and

78
00:04:12,459 --> 00:04:18,250
the sons of the functions should be

79
00:04:15,639 --> 00:04:22,630
analyzed and the reverse engineering is

80
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:24,940
really harmful and all of us knows with

81
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:27,719
repute fathers to automatically detect

82
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:30,810
them but fathers is designed

83
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:33,600
to find memory corruption bags not a

84
00:04:30,810 --> 00:04:35,880
logical flaw we are today to talk about

85
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:40,200
how to find a logical flaw in this

86
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:42,290
presentation so what I want to say is

87
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:45,840
have you ever concerned about

88
00:04:42,290 --> 00:04:46,710
low-hanging fruits what is a low-hanging

89
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:49,799
fruits bags

90
00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:54,150
I used to say is easy to find and easy

91
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:57,960
to exploit and we put automatic it is

92
00:04:54,150 --> 00:05:03,150
possible and what are this fruits look

93
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:05,370
like so we'll to some case studies based

94
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:07,440
on the historical bags

95
00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:10,350
the first one is reported last year

96
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:13,980
which is located in task scheduler

97
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:17,850
serious and it used to grant access to

98
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:21,510
job file that if you say have full

99
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:24,210
control of the affair and if you

100
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:27,480
received several parameters the most

101
00:05:24,210 --> 00:05:33,390
important one is STL which is used as a

102
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:35,030
security descriptor when we analyze it

103
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:39,120
we'll find it first

104
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:42,179
canonize the paths and make make it an

105
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:45,960
elimination to the task scheduler

106
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:50,930
services pass and then it converts the

107
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:50,930
sedl parameters to a security descriptor

108
00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:56,100
then it happens

109
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:58,770
the TSA of the target file before it

110
00:05:56,100 --> 00:06:01,919
will first reward through a system token

111
00:05:58,770 --> 00:06:06,599
so all operations is under system

112
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:09,510
Mueller's token let's ease process

113
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:13,620
actually there is three steps and then

114
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:17,760
it would use add/remove principle AC to

115
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:19,740
set a new DSL for this tactical and the

116
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:24,810
current user will get full control of

117
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:27,180
that file how it will exploit it's very

118
00:06:24,810 --> 00:06:30,900
easy first we create a hard link and

119
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:32,760
point to it to what we want to read and

120
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:35,849
then we will call the function and all

121
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:37,650
sins will be done so this is actually

122
00:06:35,849 --> 00:06:42,070
the low-hanging fruits we want to find

123
00:06:37,650 --> 00:06:45,169
it's easy to find and easy to exploit

124
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:48,920
the second one is not about hire or PC

125
00:06:45,170 --> 00:06:51,470
but about some functions related to

126
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:55,700
system service it is located in

127
00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:58,700
installer service and is used to enable

128
00:06:55,700 --> 00:07:04,700
the Installer to write to the script or

129
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:07,219
registry and shortcut and it also

130
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:11,680
received several parameters to process

131
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:18,110
and will say it will receive a package

132
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:20,419
passed and it will pop it first it was

133
00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:23,210
impersonated occur intruders token and

134
00:07:20,419 --> 00:07:26,359
check access if the current views are

135
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:28,909
could read the target cell if if okay

136
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:31,730
and it with a reward system the

137
00:07:28,910 --> 00:07:35,840
unpopular target fell to the windows

138
00:07:31,730 --> 00:07:37,490
installers pass but the copy is readable

139
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:40,250
for currently Mueller

140
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:45,050
so actually we could has the content of

141
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:47,770
the file so there is a certain time

142
00:07:45,050 --> 00:07:51,830
between the read happens and the check

143
00:07:47,770 --> 00:07:53,859
so we know how to battle with tik-tok

144
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:58,070
problem that is to say time to check

145
00:07:53,860 --> 00:08:00,979
timer will check time of use the first

146
00:07:58,070 --> 00:08:03,860
the first way is out relaxed which is

147
00:08:00,979 --> 00:08:05,659
based on device control function we

148
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:08,840
define a callback function in the way it

149
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:11,690
was accessed we could get a callback

150
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:15,080
function and win the risk condition at

151
00:08:11,690 --> 00:08:17,540
once a pass there is another way is you

152
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:20,030
use read directory changes tab your

153
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:27,380
function there is no lack of this

154
00:08:20,030 --> 00:08:31,280
function so beautiful is needed then we

155
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:32,900
say the POC first it use crystal to open

156
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:35,659
the handle of the tile file and

157
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:37,939
beautiful if the attacker power is

158
00:08:35,659 --> 00:08:42,588
copied and between the check happens

159
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:49,390
after happens and it will try to read a

160
00:08:42,589 --> 00:08:52,700
copy file if if there are you success so

161
00:08:49,390 --> 00:08:54,920
what is a simmer but after we do some

162
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:57,560
his studies

163
00:08:54,920 --> 00:09:01,610
there is several traditional ways to do

164
00:08:57,560 --> 00:09:04,550
this process first it is to analyze the

165
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:07,820
LPC interfaces related to impersonation

166
00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:10,390
why because the developers of Microsoft

167
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:15,110
always make mistakes in this area and

168
00:09:10,390 --> 00:09:18,199
not on the LPC by also some document the

169
00:09:15,110 --> 00:09:23,680
function or top human functions related

170
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:27,020
to system service so we could export

171
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:29,329
obviously interfaces from our PCB aura

172
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:32,750
also we could create a function list

173
00:09:29,330 --> 00:09:37,910
from MSDN so we need to read a spider to

174
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:43,370
correct the function list and based on

175
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:47,089
this twist we also find new bugs this is

176
00:09:43,370 --> 00:09:51,770
a new bag we found based on this this

177
00:09:47,090 --> 00:09:55,880
way and it is locating assistant service

178
00:09:51,770 --> 00:10:00,380
RPC and if you to get mini data from the

179
00:09:55,880 --> 00:10:03,590
past before you to read a mini data you

180
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:06,830
do the first impersonation in person is

181
00:10:03,590 --> 00:10:09,200
that the particular token and if you use

182
00:10:06,830 --> 00:10:11,900
a crisp file public function to check

183
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:15,140
that says if the computer clarita that

184
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:19,660
cell and if so it will revert to a

185
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:23,030
system token and then read metadata so

186
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:26,420
you only use or impersonates to check

187
00:10:23,030 --> 00:10:28,790
access after doing that it certainly use

188
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:32,479
a system token to do that file

189
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:35,420
operations so the developers make the

190
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:44,480
same mistake as we mentioned in example

191
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:46,459
two so this isn't actually new path we

192
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:50,990
want because we want to automatically

193
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:54,200
process and we will no reversal engineer

194
00:10:50,990 --> 00:10:57,140
is hard to do and low-hanging fruits in

195
00:10:54,200 --> 00:11:04,280
this area were sold out there are so

196
00:10:57,140 --> 00:11:08,620
many nice hunters like James for sure so

197
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:12,699
what is the actually silver ballots

198
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:16,630
innocence in you so the most important

199
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:19,180
see is how could we trigger those system

200
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:22,800
service trigger is functions without

201
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:27,250
doing reverse engineering one day I'm

202
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:30,400
wondering if I could use Windows app

203
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:33,310
stores to do some operations and the

204
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:34,180
will I install application from windows

205
00:11:33,310 --> 00:11:36,969
scroll saw

206
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:39,130
I find it would certainly do

207
00:11:36,970 --> 00:11:45,570
impersonation and some other sensitive

208
00:11:39,130 --> 00:11:48,580
operations so I have a thoughts when we

209
00:11:45,570 --> 00:11:52,960
install new apps applications we

210
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:55,110
actually do UI interactions such as we

211
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:58,360
click the button or press some buttons

212
00:11:55,110 --> 00:12:01,600
and then sensitive operations will

213
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:05,080
happen and it triggers system services

214
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:07,420
so we first start afflictions from a

215
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:12,640
system applications list we will create

216
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:16,870
it under the restrictions and also some

217
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:20,100
system folders we hope the process

218
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:24,820
monitors to detect if there is any

219
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:26,140
security call and then we replace the

220
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:29,050
past with a symlink

221
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:35,230
or a heart inker test if that the SAO is

222
00:12:29,050 --> 00:12:38,260
changed and then we saved a lot so after

223
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:44,130
we beauties three more I want to test if

224
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:47,439
it is effective so I use it to do some

225
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:49,990
interactions and view and use so many

226
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:53,160
which were machines to automatically

227
00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:57,460
doing this process and I do have some

228
00:12:53,160 --> 00:13:01,810
new bags found the first one is locating

229
00:12:57,460 --> 00:13:04,900
FX development services it is very easy

230
00:13:01,810 --> 00:13:07,810
to trigger it just a simple creep we

231
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:14,500
must start some Windows apps under the

232
00:13:07,810 --> 00:13:17,560
users folders and we see it first a rip

233
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:20,770
with settings file with Herning

234
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:21,540
and we windows apps such as the windows

235
00:13:20,770 --> 00:13:25,230
camera

236
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:27,139
or Windows Xbox Live and we will get

237
00:13:25,230 --> 00:13:34,350
full control when you fail because it's

238
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:38,970
used settings well we see it just cause

239
00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:44,699
obviously interfaces and you set the

240
00:13:38,970 --> 00:13:46,680
security to changes our DSL so let's see

241
00:13:44,699 --> 00:13:50,939
the video

242
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:53,040
first I'm going to reuse at the SAO of

243
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:55,350
the target file I want to get full

244
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:59,939
control and I try to residence into its

245
00:13:55,350 --> 00:14:03,839
path I order the I did't the settings

246
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:09,120
file and the repair replace it with the

247
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:11,269
harding and we point this harding to the

248
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:15,569
attack power i want to get full control

249
00:14:11,269 --> 00:14:20,790
then I start Windows apps such as

250
00:14:15,569 --> 00:14:24,620
windows camera after Creek and the

251
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:24,620
operations is trigger

252
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:40,800
so you say process monitor has hatched

253
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:45,200
the sensitive operations and now we try

254
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:45,199
to read something into it again

255
00:14:53,530 --> 00:15:08,000
yeah under you success so the second one

256
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:10,670
using sand art collector service this

257
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,920
interaction is more complicated it

258
00:15:10,670 --> 00:15:17,050
clicks the button from the menu to

259
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:20,540
trigger the program first to create a

260
00:15:17,050 --> 00:15:23,750
fair and then you set the a zero for the

261
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:26,480
same name fair publish data extension so

262
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:30,820
there is also a certain time between so

263
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:30,820
it's definitely a risk condition problem

264
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:37,760
who a Staton is even multi impersonated

265
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:40,970
a canvas users token directly use the

266
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:44,480
system privilege to do that scenes so

267
00:15:40,970 --> 00:15:49,340
this operations is definitely dangerous

268
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:52,780
and we could also use hurting to point

269
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:56,870
it to the fire one to careful control

270
00:15:52,780 --> 00:16:01,339
but this is not the mostly interested in

271
00:15:56,870 --> 00:16:04,220
a while and I will to talk about the

272
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:06,470
most interesting one I have found it is

273
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:10,070
located in Windows Defender service

274
00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:13,430
which we must have cancer it has default

275
00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:18,140
installed security software in Windows

276
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:20,569
10 and this this operation and the user

277
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:22,340
interaction is more interesting we

278
00:16:20,570 --> 00:16:26,120
creases the button from the right-click

279
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:29,780
menu many of us knows we want to detect

280
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:33,740
our computers if there is a virus or

281
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:35,920
search search and if there is a virus

282
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:38,480
has been found Windows Defender will

283
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:45,490
move it to another file or try to just

284
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:49,670
try to delete it you may say this UI and

285
00:16:45,490 --> 00:16:52,730
refused click start actions it will try

286
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:57,260
to remove the virus in your computer but

287
00:16:52,730 --> 00:17:03,260
what make me what make me miserable it

288
00:16:57,260 --> 00:17:06,470
is we are a restricted user but if I

289
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:08,809
scan the world computer what

290
00:17:06,470 --> 00:17:12,500
about what whatever happen if there is a

291
00:17:08,809 --> 00:17:13,579
virus in another users folders or in a

292
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:15,500
system for us

293
00:17:13,579 --> 00:17:19,039
I don't have the permissions that you do

294
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:21,949
that by operation right so you will call

295
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:29,120
the system service to do that to do that

296
00:17:21,949 --> 00:17:33,409
operations so you will say you just call

297
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:36,080
the system service to set the so4 title

298
00:17:33,409 --> 00:17:38,630
but before it it will try to use you

299
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:41,990
satisfy all this composition to deliver

300
00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:44,960
aware as well and if they order it will

301
00:17:41,990 --> 00:17:48,919
try to set the DSL photographer to

302
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:54,020
prevent it but it is being accessed by

303
00:17:48,919 --> 00:17:58,789
other user and this is very interesting

304
00:17:54,020 --> 00:18:02,389
I just create a plain text file the

305
00:17:58,789 --> 00:18:04,700
continent is only one two three but if

306
00:18:02,390 --> 00:18:08,419
the Windows Defender is considered it's

307
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:12,500
a virus and try to delete it and before

308
00:18:08,419 --> 00:18:17,299
the this happens I also replace it with

309
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:19,850
a link and you will say the DSL was

310
00:18:17,299 --> 00:18:23,299
changed to a special permissions

311
00:18:19,850 --> 00:18:25,730
actually you to set the DSL for anyone

312
00:18:23,299 --> 00:18:32,860
and the prevent either what is being

313
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:36,530
fixed so before we talk about those

314
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:38,689
vulnerabilities we will consider what we

315
00:18:36,530 --> 00:18:42,110
want to find if we want to find a new

316
00:18:38,690 --> 00:18:45,169
box what we want to do is will restrict

317
00:18:42,110 --> 00:18:48,590
your user must communicator system

318
00:18:45,169 --> 00:18:51,650
services there to have some sensitive

319
00:18:48,590 --> 00:18:54,230
operations so if we attach another flag

320
00:18:51,650 --> 00:18:58,370
and we will find some interesting scenes

321
00:18:54,230 --> 00:19:01,370
such as its peril the privilege from the

322
00:18:58,370 --> 00:19:04,639
system service and do what you want to

323
00:19:01,370 --> 00:19:08,389
do so when I ultimate you do this

324
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:12,770
process I just I just know if I could I

325
00:19:08,390 --> 00:19:17,149
could do more complicated so the new

326
00:19:12,770 --> 00:19:19,399
bags will be found so that is severe but

327
00:19:17,149 --> 00:19:22,998
I have just patch

328
00:19:19,399 --> 00:19:27,258
and there are several new bags has been

329
00:19:22,999 --> 00:19:30,440
found but I reported to nsrc but they

330
00:19:27,259 --> 00:19:32,719
have not fixed it yet and I'll release

331
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:40,190
them after a presentation if they tell

332
00:19:32,719 --> 00:19:41,089
