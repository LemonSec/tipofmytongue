1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,200
thanks so much for being here I'm

2
00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:07,529
Lorenzo Francesca Bri I'm a staff writer

3
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:09,269
at motherboard and just a little bit

4
00:00:07,529 --> 00:00:11,420
about me before we begin I've been

5
00:00:09,269 --> 00:00:15,299
covering InfoSec for around six years

6
00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:17,820
you may remember my weird interview with

7
00:00:15,299 --> 00:00:19,770
Gucci fur - by the way it's pronounced

8
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:22,560
Gucci for - I know it's controversial

9
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:25,289
but let's set it up let's settle that

10
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:28,169
for once and for all and despite loving

11
00:00:25,289 --> 00:00:30,480
InfoSec I also do love pizza and we can

12
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:32,040
talk about that later if you want

13
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:35,160
so this talk would have really been

14
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:39,000
called a few different ways one of them

15
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:41,489
would be attribution ain't that hard he

16
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,610
evens kids can slip malware on the

17
00:00:41,489 --> 00:00:45,538
Google Play Store and pizza spaghetti

18
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:47,250
and spyware

19
00:00:45,539 --> 00:00:51,539
luckily I think we have enough time to

20
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:55,649
cover all this angles today so before we

21
00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:56,850
begin just a quick note to define the

22
00:00:55,649 --> 00:01:00,629
terms and make sure that we're all on

23
00:00:56,850 --> 00:01:03,180
the same page so for the purpose of this

24
00:01:00,629 --> 00:01:05,280
talk government malware is my view

25
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:07,470
malicious software that collects data

26
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:10,619
from computers and more more commonly

27
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:12,260
now cell phones for police law

28
00:01:10,619 --> 00:01:16,009
enforcement and intelligence agencies

29
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:19,080
this is also sometimes called spyware

30
00:01:16,009 --> 00:01:21,330
government trojan in german it's called

31
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:24,780
the boone destroy honor in italy has

32
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:26,460
it's called Troy Troy and estado what

33
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:31,590
these are are basically remote access

34
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:33,960
trojan rats implants what is lawful

35
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:37,500
intercept the lawful intercept industry

36
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:40,250
is made by companies that do contract

37
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:43,500
work for police intelligence agencies

38
00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:45,479
mostly making the implants some of them

39
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:48,960
also develop the exploits think of an

40
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:51,509
Esso group but usually the the company

41
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:53,369
specialized in implants mostly so what

42
00:01:51,509 --> 00:01:56,040
we're talking about here is companies

43
00:01:53,369 --> 00:01:57,299
like hacking team Shane Fisher and all

44
00:01:56,040 --> 00:02:01,979
that good stuff

45
00:01:57,299 --> 00:02:04,770
and finally more of a note even though

46
00:02:01,979 --> 00:02:06,450
I'm not a in in the intelligence world

47
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:09,869
even though I've been accused of being a

48
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:11,599
CIA spy by someone in this industry I do

49
00:02:09,869 --> 00:02:14,150
have sources and methods that I

50
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:18,530
to protect as well mostly I have to

51
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:22,700
protect my sources so today we're going

52
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:25,609
to talk about how me and a group of

53
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:28,459
people Ricardo a colleague from DICE

54
00:02:25,609 --> 00:02:31,010
Italy and Claudia Bernie arey from

55
00:02:28,459 --> 00:02:33,579
security Without Borders a great

56
00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:35,599
nonprofit that does work helping

57
00:02:33,579 --> 00:02:38,000
dissidents and human-rights activists

58
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:41,179
stay secure how we discovered a rare

59
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,230
Android malware called Exodus I believe

60
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:45,290
this was really one of the first

61
00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:47,869
in-depth investigations into how local

62
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:50,929
law enforcement in Europe uses spyware

63
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:54,169
within their own borders we're used to

64
00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:58,129
see a lot of great research on this kind

65
00:02:54,169 --> 00:03:00,349
of spyware used in like the Middle East

66
00:02:58,129 --> 00:03:03,138
or South America sold by these companies

67
00:03:00,349 --> 00:03:05,149
that in this case the company was based

68
00:03:03,139 --> 00:03:09,169
in Italy and you and used the malware in

69
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:12,319
Italy this is also a great case study

70
00:03:09,169 --> 00:03:15,799
for the collaboration between security

71
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:18,018
researchers and journalists and here I

72
00:03:15,799 --> 00:03:21,409
mean that since the very beginning

73
00:03:18,019 --> 00:03:23,769
both us at motherboard and security

74
00:03:21,409 --> 00:03:26,750
Without Borders we work together to

75
00:03:23,769 --> 00:03:28,549
unravel this mystery since day one so

76
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:30,560
this is not a case where a security

77
00:03:28,549 --> 00:03:33,319
company comes to us with a report

78
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:36,609
already made an investigation completely

79
00:03:33,319 --> 00:03:41,599
finished and and asks us to to cover it

80
00:03:36,609 --> 00:03:43,879
and this investigation was basically

81
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:47,149
done on two tracks if you will on one

82
00:03:43,879 --> 00:03:49,849
side the journalist me and Ricardo did

83
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:51,049
interviews did for work some more

84
00:03:49,849 --> 00:03:54,018
investigative work

85
00:03:51,049 --> 00:03:56,060
so basically use journalist tools and on

86
00:03:54,019 --> 00:03:57,560
the other side security without borders

87
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:59,540
did the reverse engineering and the

88
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:03,439
malware analysis and what's interesting

89
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:05,959
is that we the two tracks fed on each

90
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:10,129
other and we helped each other like find

91
00:04:05,959 --> 00:04:14,500
out what was going on here so how did we

92
00:04:10,129 --> 00:04:18,829
how did we get to how did this all start

93
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:20,959
and everything began last year when vice

94
00:04:18,829 --> 00:04:23,449
Italy published this article that

95
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:24,560
revealed that the Italian police was

96
00:04:23,449 --> 00:04:27,139
able to

97
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:29,510
compelled cellphone providers and

98
00:04:27,139 --> 00:04:33,410
telephone providers into sending text

99
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:36,530
messages to fish targets that were under

100
00:04:33,410 --> 00:04:40,150
investigation the text messages were

101
00:04:36,530 --> 00:04:43,099
usually fake maintenance messages

102
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:43,760
service requests to like update settings

103
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:46,430
on the phone

104
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:49,700
basically bait to get the targets to

105
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:51,530
install malware this if you think about

106
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:53,539
it this makes a lot of sense right in

107
00:04:51,530 --> 00:04:55,340
the in the good old days if you are the

108
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:58,640
police you could just go to the service

109
00:04:55,340 --> 00:05:01,039
provider get a warrant first obviously

110
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:04,099
hopefully go to a service provider and

111
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:06,280
then get the data so either like you

112
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:09,050
know intercept phone calls text messages

113
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:11,869
and that's all you needed to do but once

114
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:15,310
end-to-end encryption became really

115
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:17,740
popular this didn't really work anymore

116
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:20,180
obviously there's still a lot of

117
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:22,250
wiretapping going on at the backbone

118
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:25,850
level but as more people use stuff like

119
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:30,080
whatsapp governments will need to use

120
00:05:25,850 --> 00:05:32,270
malware to get that data and we got here

121
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:34,640
really because in the early

122
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:37,159
two-thousands apps like Skype and

123
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:40,130
blackberry messenger popularized

124
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:42,860
end-to-end encryption and really turn

125
00:05:40,130 --> 00:05:46,039
the cards on the cops right and we

126
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:48,560
wouldn't I do think this was a landmark

127
00:05:46,039 --> 00:05:51,050
landmark moment in the development of

128
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:53,570
the lawful intercept industry and this

129
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:56,720
is also how we got to this point where

130
00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:58,550
we have incredibly popular apps like

131
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:02,150
signal and whatsapp which is installed

132
00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:04,789
by 1.5 billion people in the world and

133
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:06,590
all these apps again are out of reach

134
00:06:04,789 --> 00:06:10,669
for the cops with traditional

135
00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:13,520
surveillance methods so after the

136
00:06:10,669 --> 00:06:16,219
article that I was talking earlier a few

137
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:18,469
months later I started hearing rumors of

138
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:21,560
a new company from the south of Italy

139
00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:23,990
from this region called Calabria that

140
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:26,810
apparently was doing very well in the

141
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:28,160
spyware market but no one really knew

142
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:31,070
who they were it was kind of mysterious

143
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:33,620
and it was kind of surprising because

144
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:35,030
Calabria is mostly known for these

145
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:38,060
wonderful beaches

146
00:06:35,030 --> 00:06:40,130
and something that is called induye

147
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:43,760
a really delicious thought a spicy

148
00:06:40,130 --> 00:06:45,860
sausage that I highly recommend at the

149
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:48,500
same time a few weeks later Security

150
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:49,990
Without Borders found a bunch of

151
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:52,790
suspicious apps on the Google Play Store

152
00:06:49,990 --> 00:06:56,480
and that's when we started talking

153
00:06:52,790 --> 00:06:59,780
together and decide that there was

154
00:06:56,480 --> 00:07:03,110
something here to look into the app said

155
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:08,299
they found all looked like this you know

156
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:10,040
this says special offers apps that help

157
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:13,910
supposedly optimize the service on your

158
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:16,910
phone more offers helping and apps that

159
00:07:13,910 --> 00:07:20,350
help unlock the SIM card all things that

160
00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:23,180
looked more or less tarp harmless but

161
00:07:20,350 --> 00:07:25,400
there was actually more to it so at this

162
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:27,530
point the really big questions were is

163
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:30,080
this malware is this just I don't know

164
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:32,719
crap crap where if you will is this how

165
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:35,810
the Italian cops fish targets like we

166
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:37,880
saw before or is it just like criminals

167
00:07:35,810 --> 00:07:39,650
like you know doing some quick crypto

168
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:42,320
mining and kind of boring stuff like

169
00:07:39,650 --> 00:07:45,380
that the bigger questions were obviously

170
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:47,330
who makes these apps and who are the

171
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:51,080
victims who is who has installed these

172
00:07:47,330 --> 00:07:53,120
apps but the even bigger question was at

173
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:55,700
this point what is the story and is

174
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:58,340
there even a story here right because

175
00:07:55,700 --> 00:08:00,190
we've seen a lot of malware on on Google

176
00:07:58,340 --> 00:08:04,099
Play this is not really a new thing

177
00:08:00,190 --> 00:08:05,770
criminals have put malware on there you

178
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:09,740
know google has done an amazing work

179
00:08:05,770 --> 00:08:11,419
hardening devices like the pixel which

180
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:13,070
at this point are almost at the same

181
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:15,710
level as the iPhone in terms of security

182
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:17,930
but Google Play is really I believe

183
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:21,140
still kind of a weak spot in the whole

184
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:24,440
chain and it is possible to get malware

185
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:26,479
on it the really hard challenge here

186
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:29,600
though was that we had no information on

187
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:32,450
the victims so the way that these

188
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:35,570
investigations usually start is that a

189
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:37,220
victim like think about Hockman Monsour

190
00:08:35,570 --> 00:08:40,130
for example in the UAE a couple of years

191
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:42,230
ago when he got that phishing message he

192
00:08:40,130 --> 00:08:44,270
sent it to citizen lab and they that's

193
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:46,370
how it started in this case we had the

194
00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:48,920
apps and we had no idea who what the

195
00:08:46,370 --> 00:08:52,220
victims were which made it very hard

196
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:56,680
but we set out to see what we can find

197
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:59,780
and the mission was to find cyber gold I

198
00:08:56,680 --> 00:09:05,180
have no idea if this is a good movie but

199
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:07,459
Iraq I'm curious about it so what let's

200
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:09,670
talk about the malware as I said there

201
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:12,530
were 25 malicious apps on Google Play

202
00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:14,449
they were all uploaded between 2016 and

203
00:09:12,530 --> 00:09:18,110
2019 at different times

204
00:09:14,450 --> 00:09:21,770
obviously they were taken down after a

205
00:09:18,110 --> 00:09:24,740
while and when we contacted when both us

206
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:28,220
and Security Without Borders talked to

207
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:31,460
Google Google told us that this was old

208
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:32,960
malware and that they were like less

209
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:34,430
than a thousand victims and they were

210
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:39,020
all in Italy which made it very

211
00:09:34,430 --> 00:09:40,520
interesting like usually you see this

212
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:43,160
kind of spyware pop up all around the

213
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:49,189
world this seemed like a pretty targeted

214
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:51,439
and locally and a local operation the

215
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:54,100
damaja was pretty simple in terms of how

216
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:56,720
it worked and there were two stages

217
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:58,760
obviously I'm not a model researcher but

218
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:00,950
I'll do my best to sum up the amazing

219
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:04,100
work from Claudio and the Security

220
00:10:00,950 --> 00:10:06,830
Without Borders team the stage one was a

221
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:10,580
dropper that collected only two things

222
00:10:06,830 --> 00:10:13,150
the IMEI the unique ID for the tablet

223
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:15,680
the cell phone and the cell phone number

224
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:17,750
the function of in the code was called

225
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:19,939
check volley target which clearly

226
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:22,370
indicated that the stage one was

227
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:25,010
programmed to make sure that the person

228
00:10:22,370 --> 00:10:27,200
installing the apps was actually someone

229
00:10:25,010 --> 00:10:32,270
under investigation right the target of

230
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:34,520
a lawful police operation the problem

231
00:10:32,270 --> 00:10:37,280
however is that when Security Without

232
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:41,300
Borders installed the app and tested it

233
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:43,760
on a on a burner Android device they saw

234
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:46,430
that the the malware essentially went

235
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:48,950
straight from stage one to stage two so

236
00:10:46,430 --> 00:10:52,579
the check the check was essentially not

237
00:10:48,950 --> 00:10:56,750
enforced and stage 2 was essentially

238
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:59,139
malware right a rat you got downloaded

239
00:10:56,750 --> 00:11:02,069
and it executes a payload and

240
00:10:59,139 --> 00:11:02,069
yep it's a rat

241
00:11:08,410 --> 00:11:13,290
so the rat was what you would expect in

242
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:15,670
this kind of operations right they

243
00:11:13,290 --> 00:11:18,099
allowed the operators to see all the

244
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:19,300
apps installed on the phone record this

245
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:22,240
like turn on the microphone

246
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:25,150
surreptitiously and record the audio get

247
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:29,710
coal logs record phone calls take

248
00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:31,810
pictures get facebook contacts you know

249
00:11:29,710 --> 00:11:34,150
exfiltrate data from all these popular

250
00:11:31,810 --> 00:11:36,069
apps like telegram whatsapp viber all

251
00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:40,150
you can think of obviously get

252
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:42,970
geolocation Wi-Fi passwords everything

253
00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:45,400
you can think of but there was other

254
00:11:42,970 --> 00:11:47,950
than the stage 1 and stage 2 issue there

255
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:49,870
was another problem another couple of

256
00:11:47,950 --> 00:11:53,380
problems with the malware the first one

257
00:11:49,870 --> 00:11:56,730
was that the Exodus opened a remote

258
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:59,860
reverse shell to the command and control

259
00:11:56,730 --> 00:12:02,410
server with no TLS no web encryption

260
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:04,750
which allowed like anyone on the wire to

261
00:12:02,410 --> 00:12:08,319
sneak in the on the data and perform

262
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:09,880
like man in the middle attack which is

263
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:12,310
obviously something you don't want in

264
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:16,180
these kind of operations you may be able

265
00:12:12,310 --> 00:12:18,609
to see this is the reverse shell and the

266
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:20,770
other issue was that the malware also

267
00:12:18,610 --> 00:12:23,410
opened a bunch of ports on the device

268
00:12:20,770 --> 00:12:27,220
that allowed anyone on the same network

269
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:29,890
like imagine same Wi-Fi to get root on

270
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:31,900
the phone and tamper with the data so

271
00:12:29,890 --> 00:12:35,560
the risk here was clearly was that

272
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:38,350
someone could remove data tampered with

273
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:40,420
the evidence and you know if you're like

274
00:12:38,350 --> 00:12:42,970
a police agent working on a case you

275
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:45,130
don't only have to get the data first

276
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:48,010
but you need to like preserve it and be

277
00:12:45,130 --> 00:12:49,600
able to then later tell the court how

278
00:12:48,010 --> 00:12:53,170
you got it and make sure that you know

279
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:56,710
prove that no one has touched it here's

280
00:12:53,170 --> 00:12:57,849
the the open ports so at this point we

281
00:12:56,710 --> 00:13:00,490
knew that the malware was not that

282
00:12:57,850 --> 00:13:03,420
sophisticated but as we've seen in in

283
00:13:00,490 --> 00:13:05,560
the history of the lawful intercept

284
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:09,550
industry you don't need you don't need

285
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:12,550
fancy malware sometimes crappy malware

286
00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:16,870
is all you need although in this case

287
00:13:12,550 --> 00:13:18,579
the problems were pretty critical at the

288
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:21,190
same time a couple of weeks after we

289
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:21,670
published our story which was limited on

290
00:13:21,190 --> 00:13:24,700
Android

291
00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:28,209
we're look out the security firm also

292
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:30,550
found an iOS version it's not clear if

293
00:13:28,210 --> 00:13:32,920
this was a test or sort of like

294
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:34,420
something still in development but the

295
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:36,130
company that was making Exodus was

296
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:38,260
working also on an iOS implant which

297
00:13:36,130 --> 00:13:41,920
makes sense right you may want to you

298
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:44,080
may have to spy on some iOS users this

299
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:47,500
malware was even less sophisticated than

300
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:49,480
the Android version however first of all

301
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:52,600
it required the users to accept

302
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:54,430
enterprise certificates so not only the

303
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:57,640
user that it was basically like a double

304
00:13:54,430 --> 00:14:00,099
fishing operation you needed the user to

305
00:13:57,640 --> 00:14:02,710
install the certificate and then get

306
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:03,790
them to install the app which presumably

307
00:14:02,710 --> 00:14:06,430
makes it pretty hard

308
00:14:03,790 --> 00:14:09,310
for it to be successful also this

309
00:14:06,430 --> 00:14:11,349
malware really had limited access to the

310
00:14:09,310 --> 00:14:13,959
device right iOS is pretty hard to

311
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:16,420
exploit and this was very basic holy God

312
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:22,240
was contact somebody recordings photos

313
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:23,979
and not much more we we then tried to

314
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:25,870
figure out something about the victims

315
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:27,940
this was definitely as I said the harder

316
00:14:25,870 --> 00:14:30,310
part of the investigation and it became

317
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:34,480
later sort of the key of the scandal

318
00:14:30,310 --> 00:14:37,060
that we'll talk about later we not only

319
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:39,310
we have no idea we had no idea who the

320
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:41,319
victims were but we didn't even know how

321
00:14:39,310 --> 00:14:42,790
they got there the malware on their

322
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:45,280
phones

323
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:47,860
you know presumably was fishing but we

324
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:50,620
had no you know no phishing messages no

325
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:52,060
phishing emails it could have been

326
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:53,800
through physical access it could have

327
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:57,670
been through all days we just didn't

328
00:14:53,800 --> 00:15:00,550
know but then through what I guess you

329
00:14:57,670 --> 00:15:03,760
would call human intelligence we found

330
00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:06,609
the source that told us that the

331
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:09,460
operators of the malware were using it

332
00:15:06,610 --> 00:15:12,580
against what the source described as

333
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:15,940
guinea pigs essentially innocent people

334
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:18,460
and court documents later revealed that

335
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:23,260
this was the case and we'll talk about

336
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:25,510
that in a little bit so on the on the

337
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:28,480
legal side there was also this presented

338
00:15:25,510 --> 00:15:31,780
a bunch of issues first of all according

339
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:34,380
to Italian law putting malware on Google

340
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:36,480
Play is probably not legal

341
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:38,390
and the idea there is simply that if you

342
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:41,100
put the malware on Google Play it's

343
00:15:38,390 --> 00:15:45,120
possible that anyone could download it

344
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:46,950
and get infected moreover as I explained

345
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:51,440
earlier the vulnerabilities in the

346
00:15:46,950 --> 00:15:51,440
malware put the investigations at risk

347
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:59,520
we track down a police agent in Italy

348
00:15:56,390 --> 00:16:02,819
who reviewed the research essentially

349
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:05,220
and told us that this was not how it's

350
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:08,310
supposed to work it was actually pretty

351
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:13,020
shocked that this was something that the

352
00:16:08,310 --> 00:16:14,520
police was using at that point we had to

353
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:17,220
figure out who was behind the malware

354
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:19,890
and as you might have as you may have

355
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:22,170
heard even this week or you know this

356
00:16:19,890 --> 00:16:23,840
happens almost all the time people in

357
00:16:22,170 --> 00:16:26,550
the threat intelligence industry say

358
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:29,840
attribution is hard it's almost become a

359
00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:33,599
meme in my view it has almost no meaning

360
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:36,210
but yes attribution is hard but it's

361
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:38,720
possible you can do it and you don't

362
00:16:36,210 --> 00:16:41,700
have to be the NSA or GCHQ to do it

363
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:44,190
obviously if you are juicy hqr and I say

364
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:47,460
you have much better telemetry that I

365
00:16:44,190 --> 00:16:50,940
will ever have or security Without

366
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:52,710
Borders will ever have but the problem

367
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:55,470
that NSA and GCHQ and people like that

368
00:16:52,710 --> 00:16:59,400
face is that they don't want to reveal

369
00:16:55,470 --> 00:17:01,970
the fact that they know who did this you

370
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:06,000
know who made the malware and who hacked

371
00:17:01,970 --> 00:17:08,160
the devices this was captured pretty

372
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,959
well in this great talk and paper by

373
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:14,959
Brian Burke Solomon and Fernandez

374
00:17:09,959 --> 00:17:18,270
Guerrero sade and the gist of it is that

375
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:21,780
you you don't have to you can't really

376
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:25,560
reveal who sometimes you can't reveal

377
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:27,959
who who the actors are and the other the

378
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:29,370
other issue with attribution is that as

379
00:17:27,959 --> 00:17:31,860
the source once told me there's no

380
00:17:29,370 --> 00:17:33,750
attribution without retribution and this

381
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:35,820
means that even if like what is the

382
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:38,100
point of even accusing someone of

383
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:40,560
hacking if you cannot do anything about

384
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:43,379
it right like as a journalist I cannot

385
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:45,780
do anything about someone hacking into a

386
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:46,710
device if you're a government on the

387
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:48,779
other hand you can

388
00:17:46,710 --> 00:17:51,720
you know we've seen the FBI in died in

389
00:17:48,779 --> 00:17:53,909
Chinese and Russian hackers you know you

390
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:56,370
could use the attribution in diplomatic

391
00:17:53,909 --> 00:17:59,159
talks and stuff like that so those guys

392
00:17:56,370 --> 00:18:01,949
really can do something about it but as

393
00:17:59,159 --> 00:18:05,190
I said attribution can be done and in

394
00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:06,360
this case we did it and I think that

395
00:18:05,190 --> 00:18:07,830
it's okay for journalists to do

396
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:09,149
attribution obviously we have to do it

397
00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:11,039
responsibly we have to make sure that

398
00:18:09,149 --> 00:18:13,559
you know we're not pointing the finger

399
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:15,240
in the wrong direction we have to wait

400
00:18:13,559 --> 00:18:18,750
the public interest in revealing who is

401
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:21,000
behind a certain operation but at the

402
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:23,460
end of the day the who did it is a key

403
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:28,289
answer it's a key question that needs to

404
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:31,320
be answered in journalism and the who

405
00:18:28,289 --> 00:18:34,890
did it we really began to answer it

406
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:37,730
thanks to some breadcrumbs that we found

407
00:18:34,890 --> 00:18:40,260
in the malware this was the first the

408
00:18:37,730 --> 00:18:42,690
first evidence that we found the point

409
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:45,120
in a certain direction if on the left

410
00:18:42,690 --> 00:18:49,380
side you see this world this word monde

411
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:50,969
Itza which is a dialectal it's a dialect

412
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:55,710
from the South specifically from

413
00:18:50,970 --> 00:18:57,570
Calabria that means garbage and here on

414
00:18:55,710 --> 00:19:00,690
the on the right side you see spelled

415
00:18:57,570 --> 00:19:02,908
out the name Reno Gattuso which I don't

416
00:19:00,690 --> 00:19:06,390
know if you follow soccer but Reno

417
00:19:02,909 --> 00:19:09,149
Gattuso is a soccer player from last

418
00:19:06,390 --> 00:19:12,380
decade that was very popular and also

419
00:19:09,149 --> 00:19:15,360
from Calabria like the word Monde it'sa

420
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:18,029
the real sort of speak smoking gun

421
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:19,408
however was this server CNC that we

422
00:19:18,029 --> 00:19:22,649
found in some of the apps

423
00:19:19,409 --> 00:19:25,860
he looks pretty innocuous but he was

424
00:19:22,649 --> 00:19:30,120
actually pointing the malware to the to

425
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:32,070
the operator servers one of the keys

426
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:37,049
here is that the C&C server was self

427
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:39,240
signed with the TLS cert and security

428
00:19:37,049 --> 00:19:42,389
without borders the rotor developed a

429
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:45,149
fingerprint for the cert and search for

430
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:48,299
it on census door IO and this allowed

431
00:19:45,149 --> 00:19:52,350
them to find other servers linked to the

432
00:19:48,299 --> 00:19:54,389
same company and also all the servers

433
00:19:52,350 --> 00:19:57,539
shared the same favicon which was

434
00:19:54,390 --> 00:20:00,370
another interesting and sort of novel

435
00:19:57,539 --> 00:20:05,480
way to attribute the malware

436
00:20:00,370 --> 00:20:09,020
as a secured Without Borders searched on

437
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:10,630
shodhan for this favicon which honestly

438
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:14,299
I didn't know was even possible and

439
00:20:10,630 --> 00:20:17,870
found 40 servers all these servers were

440
00:20:14,299 --> 00:20:21,020
linked to ether a company in Calabria

441
00:20:17,870 --> 00:20:25,520
that publicly and officially was only

442
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:26,960
developing camera surveillance and the

443
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:29,000
backend to manage the camera

444
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:30,470
surveillance on their website there was

445
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:34,070
no indication that they were also making

446
00:20:30,470 --> 00:20:36,830
malware as you can see here these are

447
00:20:34,070 --> 00:20:38,840
some of the other servers we found the

448
00:20:36,830 --> 00:20:43,399
logo is right there I mean this is

449
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:45,590
almost too easy right here's the

450
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:49,990
shortened search with some of the

451
00:20:45,590 --> 00:20:53,750
servers we were able to identify and

452
00:20:49,990 --> 00:20:57,049
another breadcrumb was linked in thank

453
00:20:53,750 --> 00:21:01,039
God for LinkedIn it's always a source of

454
00:20:57,049 --> 00:21:04,190
amazing evidence we found an employee of

455
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:07,100
eserve that essentially admitted to

456
00:21:04,190 --> 00:21:08,929
being a malware developer right on his

457
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:11,330
resume he said that he developed quote

458
00:21:08,929 --> 00:21:13,250
an agent application to gather data from

459
00:21:11,330 --> 00:21:16,399
Android devices and send it to a CNC

460
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:21,590
server this is a fancy way to say I

461
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:24,559
write malware we also the we got a

462
00:21:21,590 --> 00:21:27,230
source that told us that yes effectively

463
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:29,809
eserve was developing malware and they

464
00:21:27,230 --> 00:21:32,990
called it Exodus and the name Exodus

465
00:21:29,809 --> 00:21:34,760
also came we had we had at that point we

466
00:21:32,990 --> 00:21:38,390
already knew or suspected the name

467
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:42,200
because in some of the CNC servers we

468
00:21:38,390 --> 00:21:46,820
found this this world and lastly the

469
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:50,030
final I guess point was that we were

470
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:51,500
able to FOIA and find an Italian

471
00:21:50,030 --> 00:21:54,590
government document that revealed that

472
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:57,770
he served at a 300,000 euros contract

473
00:21:54,590 --> 00:21:59,780
with the state police in Italy to

474
00:21:57,770 --> 00:22:02,139
develop passive and active interception

475
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:02,139
system

476
00:22:04,330 --> 00:22:11,360
so we knew who did it

477
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:14,300
and just to sum it up at this point we

478
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:15,919
knew that eserve was making spyware we

479
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:18,110
knew it was called Exodus we knew they

480
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:19,880
had a contract with the cops we knew

481
00:22:18,110 --> 00:22:22,610
they were there had been at least 25

482
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:24,790
apps we knew that they were like less

483
00:22:22,610 --> 00:22:26,810
than a thousand targets and victims

484
00:22:24,790 --> 00:22:30,370
again we still had no idea about the

485
00:22:26,810 --> 00:22:32,899
targets and this was really a problem

486
00:22:30,370 --> 00:22:34,820
because at this point we were pretty

487
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:38,960
much ready to publish but the

488
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:42,050
discussions among us became what happens

489
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:44,300
when we publish right even though we had

490
00:22:42,050 --> 00:22:48,700
sources telling us that some of the

491
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:51,290
victims were big innocent presumably a

492
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:56,300
majority of the targets were actually

493
00:22:51,290 --> 00:22:58,310
lawful legal targets so if this was used

494
00:22:56,300 --> 00:23:01,850
by the police we can we can imagine that

495
00:22:58,310 --> 00:23:05,929
you know maybe was a drug investigations

496
00:23:01,850 --> 00:23:09,770
perhaps organized crime so we really had

497
00:23:05,930 --> 00:23:12,080
to stop one second and think what do we

498
00:23:09,770 --> 00:23:16,430
do like do we do we mention the name of

499
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:18,230
the company do we show screenshots of

500
00:23:16,430 --> 00:23:22,910
the apps because you know that could

501
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:27,140
have maybe alerted like a mob boss that

502
00:23:22,910 --> 00:23:29,150
they were being spied on so we were very

503
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:31,750
aware and sort of concerned about the

504
00:23:29,150 --> 00:23:33,980
risk of putting legitimate

505
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:36,050
investigations at risk and even though

506
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:38,270
Google told us that the apps had been

507
00:23:36,050 --> 00:23:41,440
taken down it was possible that similar

508
00:23:38,270 --> 00:23:43,730
apps were still out there

509
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:46,240
so we decided to take an extra step and

510
00:23:43,730 --> 00:23:49,640
really make sure that we were not

511
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:51,290
screwing anybody up so we reached out to

512
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:53,180
the company which obviously we would

513
00:23:51,290 --> 00:23:56,570
have done to get their comment and this

514
00:23:53,180 --> 00:23:58,910
was a strange interaction initially they

515
00:23:56,570 --> 00:24:00,620
acted very surprised I remember a phone

516
00:23:58,910 --> 00:24:05,540
call in which they were like wait what

517
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:07,550
malware us no that's impossible then

518
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:09,470
they stop answering essentially to our

519
00:24:07,550 --> 00:24:12,680
calls and emails they ghost at us as you

520
00:24:09,470 --> 00:24:14,780
would say and interestingly after we

521
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:16,970
first contacted them they took down the

522
00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:21,050
website which was

523
00:24:16,970 --> 00:24:24,260
suspicious we also contacted the police

524
00:24:21,050 --> 00:24:27,350
a bunch of prosecutors offices here we

525
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:29,270
were sort of shooting blind if you will

526
00:24:27,350 --> 00:24:32,350
because we had no idea exactly who was

527
00:24:29,270 --> 00:24:35,840
using it in terms of prosecutors offices

528
00:24:32,350 --> 00:24:37,760
again we had we had no answer and

529
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:38,720
finally we also reached out to the

530
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:41,270
Italian government through an

531
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:43,910
intermediary essentially saying okay

532
00:24:41,270 --> 00:24:46,940
guys we are going live soon this is what

533
00:24:43,910 --> 00:24:50,270
we know let us know if we're putting

534
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:55,420
anybody in danger here and again we only

535
00:24:50,270 --> 00:24:55,420
found silence so it was time to go live

536
00:24:56,170 --> 00:25:02,120
and this is where the story gets pretty

537
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:05,449
weird I've been writing about this for a

538
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:08,060
few years and honestly I it's really

539
00:25:05,450 --> 00:25:10,340
hard to predict how stories will do they

540
00:25:08,060 --> 00:25:13,250
interested they will raise among the

541
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:16,370
public and I sort of expected this to

542
00:25:13,250 --> 00:25:18,410
not really hit I thought that you know

543
00:25:16,370 --> 00:25:20,780
we've seen a lot of spy war makers

544
00:25:18,410 --> 00:25:23,660
especially in Italy it seems like it's

545
00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:26,570
almost like a national hobby to make

546
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:30,740
malware you know we all heard about

547
00:25:26,570 --> 00:25:33,139
hacking team but there's many there's

548
00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:35,510
been many more there's been area there's

549
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:38,780
been AG which was revealed a couple of

550
00:25:35,510 --> 00:25:42,740
years ago by Kaspersky there's been RCS

551
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:44,510
lab GRC STEMI rock seer it's almost like

552
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:47,000
I can't even keep track of them anymore

553
00:25:44,510 --> 00:25:51,230
and at this point I was like who cares

554
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:54,140
there's another one who cares but as it

555
00:25:51,230 --> 00:25:56,930
turns out people cared and as soon as we

556
00:25:54,140 --> 00:26:00,770
published actually axises investigation

557
00:25:56,930 --> 00:26:02,510
became a huge story in Italy probably

558
00:26:00,770 --> 00:26:04,910
more than any story that hacking T

559
00:26:02,510 --> 00:26:08,570
related to hacking team which was kind

560
00:26:04,910 --> 00:26:10,130
of interesting what what captured the

561
00:26:08,570 --> 00:26:12,020
imagination of the Italian public was

562
00:26:10,130 --> 00:26:14,120
obviously the fact that there were

563
00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:16,280
guinea pigs there were innocent victims

564
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:18,320
that have been spied on so the headline

565
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:20,240
became you know a thousand innocent

566
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:23,360
Italians have been spied on which was

567
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:25,809
factually inaccurate but you know I

568
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:28,070
guess good to get attention

569
00:26:25,809 --> 00:26:29,629
the story really was this could have

570
00:26:28,070 --> 00:26:32,000
happened to you like this could have

571
00:26:29,630 --> 00:26:36,440
been your neighbor your friend anyone

572
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:38,570
could have been spied on and what when

573
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:40,700
things really turned weird was that when

574
00:26:38,570 --> 00:26:43,279
we found out when local news reports

575
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:45,590
revealed that two prosecutors offices

576
00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:49,039
were actually looking into the company

577
00:26:45,590 --> 00:26:50,629
the spy work maker and they opened the

578
00:26:49,039 --> 00:26:54,169
actually I'd opened the investigation

579
00:26:50,630 --> 00:26:57,679
before we ran our stories and the

580
00:26:54,169 --> 00:27:01,610
investigation was because the operators

581
00:26:57,679 --> 00:27:04,100
of the malware eserve were illegally

582
00:27:01,610 --> 00:27:08,418
monitoring innocence according to the to

583
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:11,029
the authorities and the authorities

584
00:27:08,419 --> 00:27:13,399
found that employees were even listening

585
00:27:11,029 --> 00:27:15,890
in to phone calls and reading text

586
00:27:13,399 --> 00:27:20,239
messages in the office sort of as a

587
00:27:15,890 --> 00:27:22,730
lunch break hobby I guess and we and

588
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:25,429
they were calling the victims the

589
00:27:22,730 --> 00:27:27,950
innocent victims volunteers which is an

590
00:27:25,429 --> 00:27:31,730
interesting way to describe innocent

591
00:27:27,950 --> 00:27:33,890
people the other issue that we had no

592
00:27:31,730 --> 00:27:38,450
idea before but we found out once the

593
00:27:33,890 --> 00:27:41,690
news hit was that he serve had sent

594
00:27:38,450 --> 00:27:43,220
empty servers to the prosecutors so the

595
00:27:41,690 --> 00:27:44,750
way it should work in Italy and I

596
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:46,850
presume that it that's how it works in

597
00:27:44,750 --> 00:27:48,440
many other countries is that when you

598
00:27:46,850 --> 00:27:51,408
use this kind of spyware you get the

599
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:55,549
malware you get the implants and then as

600
00:27:51,409 --> 00:27:57,770
a police agent you get the data on your

601
00:27:55,549 --> 00:28:01,639
own servers within the premises of your

602
00:27:57,770 --> 00:28:03,320
like police office or prosecutor's

603
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:05,659
office because obviously the goal there

604
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:08,689
is to make sure that no one does what

605
00:28:05,659 --> 00:28:11,870
eserve allegedly was doing but in this

606
00:28:08,690 --> 00:28:13,279
case actually the whole case the whole

607
00:28:11,870 --> 00:28:16,668
investigation started when a police

608
00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:20,029
agent was performing a routine check of

609
00:28:16,669 --> 00:28:22,909
some wiretap for an investigation there

610
00:28:20,029 --> 00:28:25,549
was some function in the on his computer

611
00:28:22,909 --> 00:28:27,799
he decided to go downstairs to the

612
00:28:25,549 --> 00:28:29,960
server room and realized that the

613
00:28:27,799 --> 00:28:33,379
servers were empty there were just metal

614
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:35,419
boxes sitting there for no reason so

615
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:37,520
it's Italian law says that the

616
00:28:35,419 --> 00:28:38,900
wiretapping servers need to be on

617
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:42,770
government premises

618
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:44,870
he serve used AWS AWS services servers

619
00:28:42,770 --> 00:28:45,830
which I guess everyone does it but you

620
00:28:44,870 --> 00:28:51,580
know this is a kind of a different

621
00:28:45,830 --> 00:28:54,470
business also another issue was that

622
00:28:51,580 --> 00:28:58,129
another issue was that prosecutors in

623
00:28:54,470 --> 00:28:59,930
one office could read investigations and

624
00:28:58,130 --> 00:29:02,000
data from any other office so if you

625
00:28:59,930 --> 00:29:06,170
were working in Rome for example you

626
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:09,500
could read the wiretap data from Naples

627
00:29:06,170 --> 00:29:13,809
or Sicily there was no no like limits on

628
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:13,809
what kind of data you could ask access

629
00:29:14,410 --> 00:29:19,670
and the result of all this is that the

630
00:29:17,390 --> 00:29:22,520
CEO and CTO of Easter are now under

631
00:29:19,670 --> 00:29:24,110
house arrest and under criminal

632
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:27,889
investigation for illegal wiretapping

633
00:29:24,110 --> 00:29:31,428
and some other crimes the authorities

634
00:29:27,890 --> 00:29:34,460
estimate that around 200 of the 800

635
00:29:31,429 --> 00:29:36,710
targets were unauthorized so again in a

636
00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:39,010
sense we don't know who they are still

637
00:29:36,710 --> 00:29:41,150
and most importantly we don't know why

638
00:29:39,010 --> 00:29:44,300
they were targeted and how they were

639
00:29:41,150 --> 00:29:45,140
chosen even so the idea furries are

640
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:46,700
looking into it

641
00:29:45,140 --> 00:29:49,250
the Italian Data Protection Authority

642
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:51,860
which is sort of like the FCC or the FTC

643
00:29:49,250 --> 00:29:54,980
I guess of Italy publicly called out

644
00:29:51,860 --> 00:29:57,770
this investigation called for better

645
00:29:54,980 --> 00:30:03,080
safeguards and a better regulation of

646
00:29:57,770 --> 00:30:06,170
government Trojans so how did we get

647
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:09,649
here how do we get to this point where

648
00:30:06,170 --> 00:30:13,220
we have a small company like this that

649
00:30:09,650 --> 00:30:14,809
can do this kind of damage and to really

650
00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:16,309
understand how we got here we have to

651
00:30:14,809 --> 00:30:18,889
look at the history of lawful intercept

652
00:30:16,309 --> 00:30:22,160
and in the last decade this history has

653
00:30:18,890 --> 00:30:24,500
been pretty well documented right you

654
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:27,500
know we've all read the citizen the

655
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:30,110
amazing citizen lab reports on companies

656
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:32,510
like an Esso group there's been dozens

657
00:30:30,110 --> 00:30:35,149
of reports from AV companies and threat

658
00:30:32,510 --> 00:30:37,520
intelligence companies in the early

659
00:30:35,150 --> 00:30:39,620
2000s we even saw leaked documents

660
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:43,280
published by WikiLeaks on these

661
00:30:39,620 --> 00:30:46,419
companies but the 2000 and 1990s on the

662
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:49,220
other hand are not very well documented

663
00:30:46,420 --> 00:30:51,350
but that is not because lawful intercept

664
00:30:49,220 --> 00:30:52,280
did not exist it's just that no one was

665
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:55,429
really paying attention

666
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:57,260
and no one knew about it but at that

667
00:30:55,430 --> 00:31:00,010
point they were already government's

668
00:30:57,260 --> 00:31:03,560
were already using malware and hacking

669
00:31:00,010 --> 00:31:05,690
to get this data and we know this

670
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:09,409
because there's some anecdotal evidence

671
00:31:05,690 --> 00:31:11,690
of it for example I know of a developer

672
00:31:09,410 --> 00:31:14,540
that again on LinkedIn thank God for

673
00:31:11,690 --> 00:31:16,130
LinkedIn he says that he's been working

674
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:20,180
on Windows malware for more than 20

675
00:31:16,130 --> 00:31:23,990
years so since the late nineties I also

676
00:31:20,180 --> 00:31:25,880
know of a case in 2002 when a hacker

677
00:31:23,990 --> 00:31:29,810
that was working for the police in

678
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:31,940
Europe downloaded a $40 rat of the

679
00:31:29,810 --> 00:31:34,460
Internet as part of a terrorist

680
00:31:31,940 --> 00:31:36,230
investigation and you know back then

681
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:38,630
that's all you needed there were no

682
00:31:36,230 --> 00:31:41,420
contractors the security of the device

683
00:31:38,630 --> 00:31:43,610
is being targeted was much lower so you

684
00:31:41,420 --> 00:31:48,710
could just go online go on some shitty

685
00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:51,229
forum maybe and get a rat also in the

686
00:31:48,710 --> 00:31:54,620
last decade or the previous decade as

687
00:31:51,230 --> 00:31:57,080
some of you may may have noticed there

688
00:31:54,620 --> 00:31:59,989
was an uptick in government employees

689
00:31:57,080 --> 00:32:02,720
coming to black hat and DEF CON not only

690
00:31:59,990 --> 00:32:04,310
to learn of new techniques and sort of

691
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:06,290
like you know learn about the

692
00:32:04,310 --> 00:32:13,520
cybersecurity industry but also to

693
00:32:06,290 --> 00:32:17,090
recruit and get new tools in the u.s. we

694
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:18,440
have more more data more we know more

695
00:32:17,090 --> 00:32:21,830
about the history of local intercept in

696
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:24,680
the u.s. the earliest mention I think

697
00:32:21,830 --> 00:32:26,659
was around 1998 when we found out about

698
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:29,720
the the FBI's network surveillance

699
00:32:26,660 --> 00:32:33,680
system called carnivore pretty funny

700
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:36,770
name I have to say in 1999 we found out

701
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:39,290
about the FBI using malware in this case

702
00:32:36,770 --> 00:32:40,970
it was a simple key logger to steal a

703
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:42,590
PGP private key

704
00:32:40,970 --> 00:32:45,410
this was a pretty interesting case where

705
00:32:42,590 --> 00:32:49,610
a mob boss in Philadelphia was using PGP

706
00:32:45,410 --> 00:32:54,590
to communicate with his associates those

707
00:32:49,610 --> 00:32:56,449
were the days of PGP and later on we

708
00:32:54,590 --> 00:32:59,720
also found out about the magic magic

709
00:32:56,450 --> 00:33:02,870
lantern malware in 2003 we learned about

710
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:04,960
operation trail mix another operation

711
00:33:02,870 --> 00:33:07,840
where FBI used by where in this case

712
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:11,169
against an animal welfare group in 2007

713
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:14,439
FBI used malware to trace some bomb

714
00:33:11,169 --> 00:33:16,899
threats which is interesting because if

715
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:19,929
if the FBI was using malware in this

716
00:33:16,899 --> 00:33:22,059
kind of cases you have to wonder how

717
00:33:19,929 --> 00:33:25,110
many we don't know about how many more

718
00:33:22,059 --> 00:33:29,139
critical cases we have never heard of

719
00:33:25,110 --> 00:33:31,360
meanwhile in Europe it's in Europe is

720
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:33,970
where the lawful in this industry lawful

721
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:36,760
intercept industry was really born in

722
00:33:33,970 --> 00:33:38,919
2003 hacking team is founded in Milan

723
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:40,899
and there's a little bit of a myth that

724
00:33:38,919 --> 00:33:42,789
hacking team at the beginning was not

725
00:33:40,899 --> 00:33:44,918
really a spiral company that they were

726
00:33:42,789 --> 00:33:47,230
sort of like a pentesting consulting

727
00:33:44,919 --> 00:33:49,779
services and that is not totally true

728
00:33:47,230 --> 00:33:53,320
they were I think their mission was

729
00:33:49,779 --> 00:33:54,520
making spire since day one and and the

730
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:57,220
proof of that is that their first

731
00:33:54,520 --> 00:34:01,990
recorded sale outside of Italy was in

732
00:33:57,220 --> 00:34:07,480
2004 this is when al-qaeda bombed a

733
00:34:01,990 --> 00:34:10,000
bunch of trains in Spain and the legend

734
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:11,949
goes that after the terrorist attack the

735
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:14,109
intelligence agency in Spain called up

736
00:34:11,949 --> 00:34:18,460
hacking team and said hey we need your

737
00:34:14,109 --> 00:34:20,139
malware and and I think I don't know if

738
00:34:18,460 --> 00:34:21,699
this was a I don't know if hacking team

739
00:34:20,139 --> 00:34:24,310
was the first one to realize that they

740
00:34:21,699 --> 00:34:26,199
could sell these tools outside of their

741
00:34:24,310 --> 00:34:28,779
own country it could have been finfisher

742
00:34:26,199 --> 00:34:31,839
but this is really when the market went

743
00:34:28,780 --> 00:34:33,010
global but for many years we had no idea

744
00:34:31,839 --> 00:34:36,040
about it no one had heard about it

745
00:34:33,010 --> 00:34:38,950
outside of the industry until 2011 when

746
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:41,020
WikiLeaks published documents from

747
00:34:38,949 --> 00:34:43,449
hacking team I believe it was a brochure

748
00:34:41,020 --> 00:34:46,540
and that's when the world realized that

749
00:34:43,449 --> 00:34:50,589
this was going on at the same time this

750
00:34:46,540 --> 00:34:52,509
is also the Arab Spring when activists

751
00:34:50,589 --> 00:34:56,710
in Tunisia Egypt Syria and other

752
00:34:52,510 --> 00:35:00,490
countries you know protested the regimes

753
00:34:56,710 --> 00:35:03,190
there and in an activist in Egypt for

754
00:35:00,490 --> 00:35:05,169
example stormed the security services of

755
00:35:03,190 --> 00:35:08,170
Egypt and found a bunch of documents

756
00:35:05,170 --> 00:35:10,270
pertaining to finfisher which is a

757
00:35:08,170 --> 00:35:14,020
company from Germany and the UK that

758
00:35:10,270 --> 00:35:16,300
also makes spyware and from then on

759
00:35:14,020 --> 00:35:18,310
hacking team and finfisher really took

760
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:20,740
over the market

761
00:35:18,310 --> 00:35:23,259
I it's it's really hard to tell who was

762
00:35:20,740 --> 00:35:24,970
the first and if you ask them probably

763
00:35:23,260 --> 00:35:26,440
they will tell especially I can team

764
00:35:24,970 --> 00:35:29,500
they would they will tell you that they

765
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:31,330
were the first but really they were they

766
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:33,280
were just the first ones to see the the

767
00:35:31,330 --> 00:35:35,920
business the first one to see that this

768
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:40,390
was a market that there was a demand for

769
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:42,790
these kind of tools at their edits on

770
00:35:40,390 --> 00:35:45,460
its best days hacking team was present

771
00:35:42,790 --> 00:35:50,490
in around 41 countries this is before

772
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:54,850
the famous 2015 breach by Phineas Fisher

773
00:35:50,490 --> 00:35:57,490
finfisher reached 32 countries this is

774
00:35:54,850 --> 00:35:59,380
based on research by citizen lab we

775
00:35:57,490 --> 00:36:02,049
don't really know exactly if that's the

776
00:35:59,380 --> 00:36:06,130
total because when Finn Fisher was also

777
00:36:02,050 --> 00:36:10,680
breached we didn't the hackers did not

778
00:36:06,130 --> 00:36:14,230
get spreadsheets detailing the customers

779
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:16,660
here you can see a map showing the sort

780
00:36:14,230 --> 00:36:20,050
of the food footprint of hacking team

781
00:36:16,660 --> 00:36:22,690
and finfisher you in orange you have

782
00:36:20,050 --> 00:36:25,360
countries that had both Finnish and

783
00:36:22,690 --> 00:36:27,640
hacking team in red hacking team and in

784
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:30,370
yellow of in Fisher so you can see that

785
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:32,830
they they really went everywhere and

786
00:36:30,370 --> 00:36:36,040
Easter and the other interesting thing

787
00:36:32,830 --> 00:36:39,940
is that some countries like Mexico UAE

788
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:43,990
or Ethiopia bought from both both

789
00:36:39,940 --> 00:36:49,210
companies and so again this is like

790
00:36:43,990 --> 00:36:52,270
early 2010 and and what we're now is

791
00:36:49,210 --> 00:36:53,500
that NSO Group company from Israel that

792
00:36:52,270 --> 00:36:57,130
you may have heard about even this week

793
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:59,760
has really taken over the market it's

794
00:36:57,130 --> 00:37:02,800
it's it's unclear it's hard to tell why

795
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:04,900
they've been able to take over it's

796
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:07,060
possible that the the breach is against

797
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:09,550
hacking team and finfisher hurt them but

798
00:37:07,060 --> 00:37:11,890
a more reasonable explanation I think is

799
00:37:09,550 --> 00:37:13,570
that NSO group is really on a whole

800
00:37:11,890 --> 00:37:15,370
nother level compared to those two

801
00:37:13,570 --> 00:37:16,960
companies I mean just to give you an

802
00:37:15,370 --> 00:37:20,770
idea hacking team was never bigger than

803
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:23,410
40 45 people and of those like a dozen

804
00:37:20,770 --> 00:37:25,150
of those were like sales people so in

805
00:37:23,410 --> 00:37:27,420
terms of deaths they really had like a

806
00:37:25,150 --> 00:37:29,560
small team of like 810 people so that

807
00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:30,830
you know it's pretty impressive to like

808
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:33,350
reach so many countries

809
00:37:30,830 --> 00:37:35,450
with such a small team on the other hand

810
00:37:33,350 --> 00:37:37,779
and it so is huge

811
00:37:35,450 --> 00:37:42,020
we're talking about around 600 employees

812
00:37:37,780 --> 00:37:43,610
I think more than 100 of them is R&D so

813
00:37:42,020 --> 00:37:47,120
people developing the exploits and the

814
00:37:43,610 --> 00:37:50,870
implants according to data from

815
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:54,529
investors and if so is present in 35

816
00:37:50,870 --> 00:37:58,700
around 35 countries with 660 or more

817
00:37:54,530 --> 00:38:03,740
customers and they made 251 million

818
00:37:58,700 --> 00:38:07,939
dollars in 2018 this is like and this is

819
00:38:03,740 --> 00:38:10,399
where NSO operates according to research

820
00:38:07,940 --> 00:38:13,160
again research by citizen lab that

821
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:16,220
tracked them through DNS cache cache

822
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:20,060
probing obviously NSO has not confirmed

823
00:38:16,220 --> 00:38:22,009
these countries but it's it's a fair bet

824
00:38:20,060 --> 00:38:25,310
that this is more or less where and its

825
00:38:22,010 --> 00:38:27,920
operates right now so where is the

826
00:38:25,310 --> 00:38:32,299
lawful intercept market today according

827
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:33,950
to Moody's and SPS a SNP it's worth 12

828
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:37,760
billion dollars and it's only gonna go

829
00:38:33,950 --> 00:38:40,069
up and getting bigger because you know

830
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:42,410
more people use cell phones more people

831
00:38:40,070 --> 00:38:44,840
use end-to-end encryption and despite

832
00:38:42,410 --> 00:38:46,549
the calls for encryption backdoors I

833
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:54,410
don't think we're going to go back to

834
00:38:46,550 --> 00:38:56,360
the golden days of easy wiretap and as I

835
00:38:54,410 --> 00:38:58,640
mentioned before a lot of countries have

836
00:38:56,360 --> 00:39:01,160
bought from different companies it's

837
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:04,520
unclear why I think we can speculate

838
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:06,770
that sometimes you may need plausible

839
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:10,280
deniability and maybe in some cases you

840
00:39:06,770 --> 00:39:12,530
want you know some companies make better

841
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:15,410
mobile versions of the malware some

842
00:39:12,530 --> 00:39:16,940
companies are better at desktop and you

843
00:39:15,410 --> 00:39:20,180
know the budgets government budgets are

844
00:39:16,940 --> 00:39:21,710
pretty good especially in the West so

845
00:39:20,180 --> 00:39:27,230
you have money to buy all these kind of

846
00:39:21,710 --> 00:39:30,530
products in in the US and China are

847
00:39:27,230 --> 00:39:32,840
interesting interesting markets and they

848
00:39:30,530 --> 00:39:35,270
don't work as the same way that the rest

849
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:36,620
of the world so if you're in the five

850
00:39:35,270 --> 00:39:41,090
eyes and you develop this kind of

851
00:39:36,620 --> 00:39:42,230
malware you usually only work with local

852
00:39:41,090 --> 00:39:46,160
companies

853
00:39:42,230 --> 00:39:48,200
sorry yeah so in five eyes for those of

854
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:50,779
you who don't know it's like US UK

855
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:52,368
Canada and New Zealand in Australia so

856
00:39:50,779 --> 00:39:53,180
if you're a company like say has a

857
00:39:52,369 --> 00:39:55,519
modsecurity

858
00:39:53,180 --> 00:39:58,970
you you only want to deal with those

859
00:39:55,519 --> 00:40:00,109
governments for various reasons first of

860
00:39:58,970 --> 00:40:02,089
all they're the ones that have the

861
00:40:00,109 --> 00:40:03,920
better budgets but also they're the ones

862
00:40:02,089 --> 00:40:07,009
that don't want to even have to worry

863
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:10,009
about their tools getting used in the

864
00:40:07,009 --> 00:40:12,319
UAE and burn that way by careless

865
00:40:10,009 --> 00:40:15,019
customers in China the situation is

866
00:40:12,319 --> 00:40:17,900
similar it's hard to tell there's really

867
00:40:15,019 --> 00:40:20,808
very little research on it but we know

868
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:22,549
that China is moving towards a reality

869
00:40:20,809 --> 00:40:26,329
where all offensive capabilities are

870
00:40:22,549 --> 00:40:29,799
kept within China it's kind of a

871
00:40:26,329 --> 00:40:31,849
balkanization of offensive capabilities

872
00:40:29,799 --> 00:40:34,849
Italy on the other hand is an

873
00:40:31,849 --> 00:40:36,589
interesting case study within Europe and

874
00:40:34,849 --> 00:40:38,839
to understand the Italian market you

875
00:40:36,589 --> 00:40:41,900
really have to understand that how

876
00:40:38,839 --> 00:40:44,319
authorities love wiretapping it's called

877
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:46,759
intercepted Sione in Italian and

878
00:40:44,319 --> 00:40:49,970
especially against organized crime this

879
00:40:46,759 --> 00:40:52,549
is often the key to solve these kind of

880
00:40:49,970 --> 00:40:56,390
investigations and if it's really a

881
00:40:52,549 --> 00:40:58,339
cultural phenomenon like even as a kid I

882
00:40:56,390 --> 00:41:02,690
remember growing up and hearing news

883
00:40:58,339 --> 00:41:05,900
about leaked inter in wiretaps showing

884
00:41:02,690 --> 00:41:07,489
up on the news from you know politicians

885
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:09,700
talking on the phone and stuff like that

886
00:41:07,489 --> 00:41:12,230
it's really ingrained in the culture and

887
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:15,140
the other interesting aspect of Italy is

888
00:41:12,230 --> 00:41:16,670
that there's really no like the the way

889
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:18,920
the market works is that every almost

890
00:41:16,670 --> 00:41:21,230
every prosecutor's office has a lot of

891
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:22,489
leeway and freedom to get their own

892
00:41:21,230 --> 00:41:24,789
tools

893
00:41:22,489 --> 00:41:28,609
there's no must know like centralized

894
00:41:24,789 --> 00:41:30,710
pipeline for this kind of tools and this

895
00:41:28,609 --> 00:41:33,828
has created a market where if you're a

896
00:41:30,710 --> 00:41:35,930
small start-up in a city like Milan or

897
00:41:33,829 --> 00:41:40,489
the south of Italy you can really reach

898
00:41:35,930 --> 00:41:41,629
your own local offices just by virtue of

899
00:41:40,489 --> 00:41:44,950
being there and

900
00:41:41,630 --> 00:41:47,660
having connections with the the police

901
00:41:44,950 --> 00:41:51,319
so again the result is a fragmented

902
00:41:47,660 --> 00:41:53,600
market with a lot of companies a lot of

903
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:56,060
boutique companies that provide these

904
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:58,910
services in the past we had like a

905
00:41:56,060 --> 00:42:01,700
network level interception like Aria RCS

906
00:41:58,910 --> 00:42:06,319
and more recently malware makers like

907
00:42:01,700 --> 00:42:07,250
hacking team nag and now we serve just

908
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:10,220
to give you an idea of the Italian

909
00:42:07,250 --> 00:42:14,750
market luckily we have some data from

910
00:42:10,220 --> 00:42:16,730
the Ministry of Justice in 2017 there

911
00:42:14,750 --> 00:42:21,310
there have been one hundred and six

912
00:42:16,730 --> 00:42:24,860
thousand phone wiretaps these are the

913
00:42:21,310 --> 00:42:28,790
good old traditional wiretaps on the

914
00:42:24,860 --> 00:42:33,530
wire made by ISPs so you know no

915
00:42:28,790 --> 00:42:37,550
encryption and there's also been sixteen

916
00:42:33,530 --> 00:42:39,350
thousand what has done with bugs and

917
00:42:37,550 --> 00:42:41,900
what I mean bugs is not here is not

918
00:42:39,350 --> 00:42:45,259
vulnerabilities it's more like you know

919
00:42:41,900 --> 00:42:48,710
physical interception devices put under

920
00:42:45,260 --> 00:42:51,890
a table or in a car to spy on suspected

921
00:42:48,710 --> 00:42:53,240
criminals and what we really care about

922
00:42:51,890 --> 00:42:55,960
today and what we're talking about today

923
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:59,060
is wiretap done through electronic

924
00:42:55,960 --> 00:43:02,420
surveillance we think that this is

925
00:42:59,060 --> 00:43:04,430
malware but the data from the Minister

926
00:43:02,420 --> 00:43:08,090
of Justice is not as detailed doesn't

927
00:43:04,430 --> 00:43:09,980
really spell out malware of this there

928
00:43:08,090 --> 00:43:13,760
were four thousand five hundred in one

929
00:43:09,980 --> 00:43:15,380
year and also we know that there's at

930
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:17,300
least one hundred and forty hundred and

931
00:43:15,380 --> 00:43:19,100
fifty licensed companies in Italy

932
00:43:17,300 --> 00:43:22,580
companies that can sell these kind of

933
00:43:19,100 --> 00:43:25,339
capabilities to the government this is a

934
00:43:22,580 --> 00:43:30,490
chart that shows you the number of

935
00:43:25,340 --> 00:43:30,490
electronic wiretap in the country

936
00:43:31,540 --> 00:43:37,970
so I think that we're we're at the point

937
00:43:34,580 --> 00:43:39,880
where lawful intercept is here to stay

938
00:43:37,970 --> 00:43:42,950
obviously there's a lot of debates and

939
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:48,170
controversy around stuff like the wasner

940
00:43:42,950 --> 00:43:52,040
agreement which aims to regulate how

941
00:43:48,170 --> 00:43:54,800
companies in the West can export malware

942
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:57,130
to other countries but what this

943
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:59,570
investigation was about is how

944
00:43:57,130 --> 00:44:05,270
governments use these tools within their

945
00:43:59,570 --> 00:44:07,010
own confines and the reason I believe

946
00:44:05,270 --> 00:44:09,110
lawful intercept is not going to go away

947
00:44:07,010 --> 00:44:10,940
is that end-to-end encryption is not

948
00:44:09,110 --> 00:44:14,720
going to go away right

949
00:44:10,940 --> 00:44:17,630
the DOJ can call for actors as much as

950
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:20,029
they want and you know we you may have

951
00:44:17,630 --> 00:44:22,540
heard about the Australian law that's a

952
00:44:20,030 --> 00:44:25,450
very controversial about vectors as well

953
00:44:22,540 --> 00:44:28,970
but this is not going to stop encryption

954
00:44:25,450 --> 00:44:32,060
and this means that it will only be more

955
00:44:28,970 --> 00:44:33,649
and more NSO's and hacking teams ready

956
00:44:32,060 --> 00:44:36,020
to provide services to governments all

957
00:44:33,650 --> 00:44:39,680
around the world the real challenge is

958
00:44:36,020 --> 00:44:41,240
at this point become to figure out who

959
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:43,609
are the companies that provide these

960
00:44:41,240 --> 00:44:46,279
services and most importantly who are

961
00:44:43,610 --> 00:44:48,950
the people behind them and how you bet

962
00:44:46,280 --> 00:44:51,170
them to prevent something like this how

963
00:44:48,950 --> 00:44:52,970
do you make sure that the companies that

964
00:44:51,170 --> 00:44:56,050
make these malware do not become

965
00:44:52,970 --> 00:45:02,000
themselves despised and sort of like

966
00:44:56,050 --> 00:45:03,590
amateur police agents and again thank

967
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,880
you very much to security with our

968
00:45:03,590 --> 00:45:06,440
borders for their helping is that

969
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:09,950
investigation I wouldn't be here without

970
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:11,600
them so thank you Claudia and thanks to

971
00:45:09,950 --> 00:45:16,790
Ricardo pallucci Nia my call it from

972
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:18,170
vice Italy and yeah thank you so much if

973
00:45:16,790 --> 00:45:27,960
you have any questions I think

974
00:45:18,170 --> 00:45:27,960
[Applause]
