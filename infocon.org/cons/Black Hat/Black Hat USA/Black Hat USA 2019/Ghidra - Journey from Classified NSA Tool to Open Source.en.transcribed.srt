1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,170
good afternoon and welcome to Guidry

2
00:00:01,949 --> 00:00:04,830
journey from classified NSA tool to open

3
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:07,529
source

4
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:09,599
we're in Islander e aí and we have Chris

5
00:00:07,529 --> 00:00:11,790
delicate and Brian Knight and presenting

6
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:13,469
today a couple of notes stop by the

7
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:15,719
business hall located in Mandalay Bay

8
00:00:13,469 --> 00:00:17,490
Oceanside shoreline ballrooms on level 2

9
00:00:15,719 --> 00:00:19,259
the blackout Arsenal is running in

10
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:21,359
business hall on level two as well lunch

11
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:23,730
will be served in Bayside a and B

12
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:24,930
between 1:00 and 2:30 with that I'd ask

13
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:37,739
you to silence your cell phones and

14
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:40,140
welcome Chris and Brian thanks everyone

15
00:00:37,739 --> 00:00:43,828
thanks for coming it's a big honor to be

16
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:45,870
here speaking for NSA the guitro team

17
00:00:43,829 --> 00:00:47,460
and myself is a big honor when we first

18
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:49,919
started the process of moving to

19
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:51,059
classified and open source I sort of

20
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,500
made a joke like hey we should go to

21
00:00:51,059 --> 00:00:54,690
blackhat like sort of think it would

22
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:56,039
never happen but uh you know but here we

23
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:58,589
are it's just pretty oh it's pretty

24
00:00:56,039 --> 00:00:59,250
awesome so thank you so for some

25
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:02,010
introductions

26
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:04,280
I'm Brian Nitin I'm a researcher at NSA

27
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:08,189
I've been a teacher developer since

28
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:10,650
about 2001 currently these days what I

29
00:01:08,189 --> 00:01:14,130
do is what I like what I call Applied

30
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:15,659
Research where I'm doing IOT vr4 for

31
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:16,949
various things we're turning over to

32
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:19,590
Chris now and then we'll come back and

33
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:22,830
talk about some other parts of heater so

34
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:24,600
hi my name is Chris I'm a tech lead in

35
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:26,700
research which means I guide a lot of

36
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:27,658
really cool cyber projects I'm not on

37
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:28,770
the guillotine but I've been working

38
00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:30,000
with Brian for many years we've

39
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:32,429
collaborated on a lot of different

40
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,720
things and he basically brought me here

41
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:38,090
to talk about all the stuff he doesn't

42
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:40,048
want to talk about so such as the agenda

43
00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:41,610
we're gonna start off talking a little

44
00:01:40,049 --> 00:01:43,649
bit about the origins of deidre and

45
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:45,360
putting it in context with NSA and

46
00:01:43,649 --> 00:01:47,430
research it and saying kind of how that

47
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:49,170
makes sense and why we did what we did

48
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:51,119
and a little bit about the background of

49
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:53,070
the tool and some more information about

50
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:54,270
features and why we sort of felt like we

51
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:56,729
needed to have a tool like this built

52
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:58,798
in-house and then we're gonna go and

53
00:01:56,729 --> 00:02:00,539
discuss the framework why we call it a

54
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:01,500
framework what it really means and

55
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:03,750
there's going to be a lot of cool

56
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:04,950
screenshots there and then we're going

57
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:06,810
to touch on some more open source

58
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:08,580
aspects of it and all the little things

59
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:10,800
that we had to do to kind of bring the

60
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:12,629
tool open source and what it means to do

61
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,800
that and then at the end we've talked

62
00:02:12,629 --> 00:02:15,120
away some new features and

63
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:17,370
Metrix kind of hopefully keep people in

64
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:18,570
their seats till then and it'll be

65
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:22,080
really exciting if you can make it that

66
00:02:18,570 --> 00:02:23,970
long so I thought it'd be fun to do a

67
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:26,880
little bit of jargon that we have not

68
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:28,350
all this is specific to NSA but like any

69
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:30,390
other professional organization we've

70
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:31,950
got some words and phrases that we kind

71
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:33,269
of use internally and we're gonna

72
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:34,619
probably be saying certain things I

73
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:36,480
figured it'd be good to kind of get some

74
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:38,460
stuff out there so software reverse

75
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:40,290
engineering s-sorry for not familiar

76
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:42,210
with the tool that we're talking about

77
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:43,920
here gira is a software reverse

78
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:45,360
engineering tool I'm gonna talk a little

79
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:47,519
bit more about that in a bit but just so

80
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:50,310
you see sre we're gonna see you can see

81
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:51,540
that where we say that VR vulnerability

82
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:54,740
research is something you do with a

83
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:57,090
software reverse engineering tool cyber

84
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:58,560
it's one of everybody's favorite words

85
00:02:57,090 --> 00:03:00,630
these days right cyber cyber security

86
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:03,390
when we say cyber I guess we kind of

87
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:04,859
mean computers computer networks that

88
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:06,269
sort of thing it's almost become

89
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:08,670
synonymous with the next thing which we

90
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:10,680
call CNO computer network operations

91
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:12,660
that's kind of a government abbreviation

92
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:13,490
that we like to use to describe cyber

93
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:16,740
things

94
00:03:13,490 --> 00:03:19,260
cyber cyber and so then there's the I

95
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:20,459
see you know we're going to say that

96
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:21,329
quite a bit to the intelligence

97
00:03:20,459 --> 00:03:24,090
community that's where we're from

98
00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:26,730
there's about 16 entities within the

99
00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:28,350
intelligence community and we'll say

100
00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:30,269
things like they're releasing of Gita

101
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:34,290
was good for the IC or this whole you

102
00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:35,940
know process supports the IC on class is

103
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:37,560
a word that we use a sort of

104
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:39,989
abbreviation to say unclassified it

105
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:41,760
means something that we've it's not

106
00:03:39,989 --> 00:03:44,459
protected under classification any

107
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:46,649
longer and that's kind of you know part

108
00:03:44,459 --> 00:03:48,840
of the journey of Gita has gotten us to

109
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:50,640
that point an NSA mission these are

110
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:53,310
other we're gonna hear say these things

111
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:55,380
mission is kind of like the goal the

112
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:57,750
point of what we do why we do what we do

113
00:03:55,380 --> 00:04:00,930
and when you hear me say something like

114
00:03:57,750 --> 00:04:02,790
I do cyber a sorry for the CNO mission

115
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:06,860
and I see now you can understand them

116
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:09,660
talking about so here's NSA headquarters

117
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:11,040
this is I'm going to a little bit about

118
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:13,109
the NSA in case everyone's not

119
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:14,880
completely familiar National Security

120
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:18,540
Agency is part of Department offense and

121
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:21,680
we have a bunch of missions that support

122
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:25,229
cyber type things we are in charge of

123
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:26,750
supporting and securing national

124
00:04:25,229 --> 00:04:28,640
security systems and that

125
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:30,950
that contain classified data and are

126
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:34,750
used in the conduct of intelligence and

127
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:37,640
military operations we also support our

128
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:39,830
leaders with information provide them to

129
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:41,479
provide decision-makers the information

130
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:44,590
they need certain make policies and

131
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:48,440
decisions we also work with industry to

132
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:50,929
secure critical infrastructure that's

133
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:52,850
different than cyber not cyber but a

134
00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:54,440
different than national security

135
00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:56,330
infrastructure in that it's the public

136
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:58,969
infrastructure critical systems that

137
00:04:56,330 --> 00:05:00,770
help society keep going think about

138
00:04:58,970 --> 00:05:02,630
power water that kind of stuff

139
00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:05,299
and finally we support the Armed Forces

140
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:07,040
and we work with them with cyber

141
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:08,570
indicators and other things of Intel

142
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:11,630
value to kind of help them do what they

143
00:05:08,570 --> 00:05:14,210
do and protect them and so with all

144
00:05:11,630 --> 00:05:15,770
these cyber responsibilities you kind of

145
00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:17,719
imagine that we've probably got to have

146
00:05:15,770 --> 00:05:19,940
some tools that we've developed to help

147
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:23,360
us with all our cyber right and so

148
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:27,650
that's where it comes into play but

149
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:29,090
where did you come from this building up

150
00:05:27,650 --> 00:05:32,780
here this is the headquarters Francaise

151
00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:37,250
research so we're brian and i work go in

152
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:40,549
there every single day except the

153
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:41,660
weekends the weekends and so you think

154
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:43,540
for a second what do you think of when

155
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:46,250
you think of research what is research a

156
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:47,210
lot of people research just means

157
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:50,120
something like you're googling around

158
00:05:47,210 --> 00:05:52,190
maybe reading some some articles looking

159
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:54,229
at Stack Overflow connect some code but

160
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:55,490
I'm thinking I'm gonna ask you to think

161
00:05:54,229 --> 00:05:58,520
of what at an organizational level

162
00:05:55,490 --> 00:06:02,030
research means right and so in some

163
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:06,140
organizations research is a means to

164
00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:08,900
sort of analyze a specific activity or

165
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:10,190
technology for a specific defined amount

166
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:12,200
of time and then produce some kind of a

167
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:13,460
paper at the end of it no no and other

168
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:14,659
organizations you want to take some

169
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:16,969
technology and try to push it to its

170
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:19,580
limits and develop some proof-of-concept

171
00:06:16,970 --> 00:06:21,530
p'tee NSA it's not exactly either of

172
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:23,270
those that we do we do what we like to

173
00:06:21,530 --> 00:06:24,799
call mission oriented research and so

174
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:28,130
back to those missions I mentioned

175
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:29,720
earlier our goal is to impact the

176
00:06:28,130 --> 00:06:32,120
mission in a positive manner and

177
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:35,660
whatever the timeframe necessary to do

178
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:37,099
that so it gives us flexible time to do

179
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:38,570
whatever we need to do that we think is

180
00:06:37,099 --> 00:06:39,800
going to impact the mission and some of

181
00:06:38,570 --> 00:06:40,190
those things you can see how you should

182
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:42,140
see how

183
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:43,670
kind of fits into that because as we've

184
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:45,409
announced this has been an ongoing

185
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:45,740
project within research for many years

186
00:06:45,410 --> 00:06:48,170
now

187
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:50,030
other projects similar in a similar vein

188
00:06:48,170 --> 00:06:52,160
would be SELinux where we worked on that

189
00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:54,229
and the mission was sort of to help

190
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:57,470
critical infrastructure and secure that

191
00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:59,630
and so maybe you want you're asking

192
00:06:57,470 --> 00:07:01,460
yourself now that I've said this is by

193
00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:03,260
research why doesn't it say have a real

194
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:05,150
an embedded research organization why

195
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:08,719
don't they just farm the things out that

196
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:12,080
they want well there's a quote I like to

197
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:13,640
use to kind of illuminate what it means

198
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:17,120
that to have an NSA research

199
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:20,030
organization and so there's an American

200
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:21,290
inventor Henry Ford who's credited with

201
00:07:20,030 --> 00:07:24,340
the invention the automobile he

202
00:07:21,290 --> 00:07:26,510
supposedly said something along lines of

203
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:27,560
if I had asked the people what they

204
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:30,980
wanted they would have said faster

205
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:33,170
horses and so what that means in this

206
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:34,910
context is a lot of times the

207
00:07:33,170 --> 00:07:36,530
organization or the individual that

208
00:07:34,910 --> 00:07:38,600
needs the innovation doesn't necessarily

209
00:07:36,530 --> 00:07:40,369
know exactly what they need they can

210
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:43,790
only see so far ahead of themselves and

211
00:07:40,370 --> 00:07:45,560
see essentially I'm doing this now give

212
00:07:43,790 --> 00:07:47,570
me more of what I've already got to kind

213
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:49,370
of help me complete what I'm doing and

214
00:07:47,570 --> 00:07:50,990
don't have the ability to kind of step

215
00:07:49,370 --> 00:07:53,570
back and figure out what the real

216
00:07:50,990 --> 00:07:55,160
problem is so at NSA research we're

217
00:07:53,570 --> 00:07:56,900
embedded within NSA and that gives us

218
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:58,520
the ability to sit side by side with our

219
00:07:56,900 --> 00:08:00,440
operational entities learn their

220
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:02,330
problems and then take a big step back

221
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:04,280
and not have to be beholden to the

222
00:08:02,330 --> 00:08:05,900
operational of day to day and we can

223
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:07,280
come up with innovative solutions that

224
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:09,109
they never maybe even thought of right

225
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:10,520
in the case of faster horses we can come

226
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:13,640
up with a car or something else that

227
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:15,500
gets them what they need another cool

228
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:17,650
aspect about NSA research and this is a

229
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:19,970
shameless plug for working in research

230
00:08:17,650 --> 00:08:21,380
where our own director with an NSA which

231
00:08:19,970 --> 00:08:23,540
means we're not necessarily beholden to

232
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:26,530
requirements from any other org we have

233
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:29,270
the mission to positively impact

234
00:08:26,530 --> 00:08:30,890
operations obviously but we can do it in

235
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:33,110
our own way and it helps us to kind of

236
00:08:30,890 --> 00:08:34,819
it gives us a lot of freedom to think of

237
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:36,830
solutions that are we're passionate

238
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:38,060
about and we can do things that we're

239
00:08:36,830 --> 00:08:39,650
interested in rather than having

240
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:41,449
requirements given to us to say do these

241
00:08:39,650 --> 00:08:43,370
things we can come up with ideas

242
00:08:41,450 --> 00:08:44,900
sometimes they fail one of the best

243
00:08:43,370 --> 00:08:47,380
things about being in research the NSA

244
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:50,360
is we have the freedom to fail and

245
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:51,830
failing is just really figuring out one

246
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:52,910
way not to do something sometimes you

247
00:08:51,830 --> 00:08:53,779
figure out a lot of ways now to do

248
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:55,399
something but

249
00:08:53,779 --> 00:09:02,089
feelings okay and we like we like that

250
00:08:55,399 --> 00:09:03,709
aspect of it and so why is I'm going to

251
00:09:02,089 --> 00:09:04,850
talk to something that's not exactly on

252
00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:07,518
this side but you can look at those

253
00:09:04,850 --> 00:09:09,769
facts up there while I say what you may

254
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:11,990
be asking yourself why is gauge is still

255
00:09:09,769 --> 00:09:14,569
in research right and like I was saying

256
00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:15,740
before the mission rates the research we

257
00:09:14,569 --> 00:09:17,449
do isn't meant to sort of have a

258
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:19,610
beginning middle and an end there's not

259
00:09:17,449 --> 00:09:20,959
a time span and there's no paper that

260
00:09:19,610 --> 00:09:23,029
we're gonna write at the end of reverse

261
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:25,430
engineering and say we researched it and

262
00:09:23,029 --> 00:09:27,379
here's the result what Geezer is is a

263
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:30,050
tool that's been built to be a framework

264
00:09:27,379 --> 00:09:31,790
or foundation to support future research

265
00:09:30,050 --> 00:09:34,219
and having that entire system in-house

266
00:09:31,790 --> 00:09:35,899
gives us the ability to turn the knobs

267
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:37,129
and twiddle the the screens and do

268
00:09:35,899 --> 00:09:38,779
whatever it is we can do to support

269
00:09:37,129 --> 00:09:41,059
exactly how we want to make that work

270
00:09:38,779 --> 00:09:42,559
and having an out that an external tool

271
00:09:41,059 --> 00:09:44,509
wouldn't you wouldn't be able to

272
00:09:42,559 --> 00:09:46,579
function in the same manner and so now

273
00:09:44,509 --> 00:09:48,740
Deidre is a platform or a framework that

274
00:09:46,579 --> 00:09:50,239
can sustain next generation

275
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:52,009
vulnerability research different kinds

276
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:54,709
of binary analysis program analysis and

277
00:09:52,009 --> 00:09:56,209
all kinds of things that we haven't even

278
00:09:54,709 --> 00:09:59,930
thought of yet but we're keeping it

279
00:09:56,209 --> 00:10:01,819
in-house for those reasons and so as I

280
00:09:59,930 --> 00:10:04,309
mentioned earlier the software reverse

281
00:10:01,819 --> 00:10:06,050
engineering why would you even do that

282
00:10:04,309 --> 00:10:08,029
what's the point of it well not

283
00:10:06,050 --> 00:10:10,219
everybody sort of does software versus

284
00:10:08,029 --> 00:10:11,689
engineering so I want to explain a

285
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:14,569
little bit about that as we as you know

286
00:10:11,689 --> 00:10:17,319
so you can follow along ultimately it's

287
00:10:14,569 --> 00:10:19,430
to find out what's in your binary

288
00:10:17,319 --> 00:10:20,839
software reverse engineering is you have

289
00:10:19,430 --> 00:10:21,979
a binary you're taking it you're gonna

290
00:10:20,839 --> 00:10:24,199
look at and try to figure out what it

291
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:25,790
does why would you want to do that well

292
00:10:24,199 --> 00:10:28,008
there's a couple big cybersecurity

293
00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:29,420
reasons I can think of number one you've

294
00:10:28,009 --> 00:10:31,309
got a binder on your network or just

295
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:32,329
your computer that you're using and you

296
00:10:31,309 --> 00:10:34,459
want to look at it and for the

297
00:10:32,329 --> 00:10:35,779
vulnerabilities that may be in there so

298
00:10:34,459 --> 00:10:36,619
you can defend yourself from them you

299
00:10:35,779 --> 00:10:37,670
don't know what's in there you don't

300
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:39,439
have the source you just have a binary

301
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:40,729
maybe you bought it maybe it's part of

302
00:10:39,439 --> 00:10:43,040
the operating system who knows it's

303
00:10:40,730 --> 00:10:45,139
there I know the reason why you might

304
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:47,959
want to use software versus engineering

305
00:10:45,139 --> 00:10:49,399
tool like this is you have a pioneer on

306
00:10:47,959 --> 00:10:51,290
your network but you didn't put it there

307
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:52,730
you don't know where it's from maybe

308
00:10:51,290 --> 00:10:53,779
it's malware maybe it's not but you want

309
00:10:52,730 --> 00:10:55,850
to figure out what it's doing there

310
00:10:53,779 --> 00:10:58,610
where it came from and what maybe it's

311
00:10:55,850 --> 00:11:01,100
done to your network already and so in

312
00:10:58,610 --> 00:11:02,779
2000 there weren't a lot of tools that

313
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:04,339
did that type of thing and there were

314
00:11:02,779 --> 00:11:05,959
really no pools that had all these

315
00:11:04,339 --> 00:11:07,460
features that we were looking for here

316
00:11:05,959 --> 00:11:09,529
so I'm not going to talk too

317
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:10,790
one of these but some of the key things

318
00:11:09,529 --> 00:11:11,960
that we were looking for back then that

319
00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:14,810
we're not addressed by anything on the

320
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:18,080
market we were doing collaborative

321
00:11:14,810 --> 00:11:19,969
reverse engineering in a way that was

322
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:22,339
not really addressed by existing tools

323
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:23,959
back then teaming keep multiple people

324
00:11:22,339 --> 00:11:27,649
working on a single binary and sort of

325
00:11:23,959 --> 00:11:28,699
reversing different parts of it then

326
00:11:27,649 --> 00:11:30,050
there we wanted to have a lot of

327
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:31,730
extendibility and integration for

328
00:11:30,050 --> 00:11:33,260
different tools to sort of improve the

329
00:11:31,730 --> 00:11:34,850
overall workflow by putting a bunch of

330
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:36,770
things together that make reverse

331
00:11:34,850 --> 00:11:38,959
engineers you know life a little bit

332
00:11:36,770 --> 00:11:41,600
easier and then obviously undo redo is a

333
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:43,670
feature that's sort of critical when

334
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:45,500
you're looking for a way to sort of

335
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:47,120
analyze a binary they certainly even

336
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:48,529
know where it came from so you don't

337
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:49,790
really know you want it probably to go

338
00:11:48,529 --> 00:11:52,730
down a lot of false starts and then dial

339
00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:54,500
it back and have to do other things and

340
00:11:52,730 --> 00:11:56,630
then headless automation right you want

341
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:58,670
to do that too you can run a lot more

342
00:11:56,630 --> 00:12:04,250
things if we can run stuff on the side

343
00:11:58,670 --> 00:12:05,599
where in the background and so what this

344
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:08,690
chart is don't look too closely at the

345
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:10,399
numbers uh not sure what exactly that

346
00:12:08,690 --> 00:12:11,690
means but ultimately we're trying to

347
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:13,970
show here is that software is over the

348
00:12:11,690 --> 00:12:15,290
years has been growing in size and not

349
00:12:13,970 --> 00:12:16,880
only has been growing in size it's been

350
00:12:15,290 --> 00:12:18,140
proliferating and working its way into

351
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:19,520
everything that we have right

352
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:20,630
and so there's vulnerabilities and

353
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:22,850
malware potential I was talking about

354
00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:26,240
earlier that's growing too it's just

355
00:12:22,850 --> 00:12:27,620
everywhere it's all you know software

356
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:29,660
every step of software we're using is

357
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:31,040
any bigger there's more possibility for

358
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:32,689
vulnerabilities more possibility for

359
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:34,819
malware and the networks are connected

360
00:12:32,690 --> 00:12:37,880
so there's more possibility for stuff to

361
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:41,330
get everywhere so this is what we sort

362
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:43,160
of anticipated and there part of the

363
00:12:41,330 --> 00:12:45,140
reason that we want to get this to lapse

364
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:47,510
everybody can start using it and help us

365
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:48,800
and help the community get better at

366
00:12:47,510 --> 00:12:50,959
reverse engineering because this is not

367
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:52,490
a skill set that is going to diminish

368
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:53,510
and it's not something that's we're not

369
00:12:52,490 --> 00:12:55,100
going to need in a few years it's

370
00:12:53,510 --> 00:12:56,750
something if anything we're going to

371
00:12:55,100 --> 00:13:00,020
need a lot more people with that skill

372
00:12:56,750 --> 00:13:01,310
set in a few years and so I think at

373
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:04,160
this point I'm gonna hand back to Brian

374
00:13:01,310 --> 00:13:07,819
thanks al you ready I am ready are you

375
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:09,319
ready all right so enter the dragon to

376
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:10,550
sort of solve all the problems that was

377
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:13,550
outlined by Chris so thanks Chris for

378
00:13:10,550 --> 00:13:14,719
going over that so Ghidorah is our is

379
00:13:13,550 --> 00:13:17,270
there sort of our solution that we came

380
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:19,640
up with to solve all those cyber issues

381
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:20,930
of scaling the teaming there's been a

382
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:21,230
lot of questions about what you just

383
00:13:20,930 --> 00:13:23,540
like

384
00:13:21,230 --> 00:13:26,630
stands for where the name came from so

385
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:30,140
I'm gonna give you a big a big opening

386
00:13:26,630 --> 00:13:32,180
reveal here since we use lots of jargon

387
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:35,930
my fortune a I'm just kidding that's a

388
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:37,520
joke this is what keys are actually

389
00:13:35,930 --> 00:13:39,079
stands for is what you think it's the

390
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:40,280
three-headed monster right because we

391
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:42,110
were trying to bring together three

392
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:44,480
things into one body one body of

393
00:13:42,110 --> 00:13:46,700
knowledge one body of work three three

394
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:49,730
key features that we had in terms of

395
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:51,410
like our research requirements when we

396
00:13:49,730 --> 00:13:52,730
started on this was was to have scaling

397
00:13:51,410 --> 00:13:55,790
teaming and extendibility

398
00:13:52,730 --> 00:13:57,890
all in one one environment one framework

399
00:13:55,790 --> 00:13:59,959
or one tool and we also wanted to bring

400
00:13:57,890 --> 00:14:01,850
together because before Dedra like you

401
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:04,270
would have your hex editor open in one

402
00:14:01,850 --> 00:14:06,410
as one application you would have your

403
00:14:04,270 --> 00:14:08,060
disassembler in one application and you

404
00:14:06,410 --> 00:14:10,579
would have say a debugger or some kind

405
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:11,900
of other amulet emulation system as a

406
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:13,280
separate device and they weren't all

407
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:14,300
working together so we wanted to bring

408
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:16,339
all those together

409
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:18,050
hence the three-headed monster that's we

410
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:20,210
had you know that's where the name comes

411
00:14:18,050 --> 00:14:21,530
from so let's let's do a quick

412
00:14:20,210 --> 00:14:24,530
run-through of some of the major

413
00:14:21,530 --> 00:14:26,060
features and see how I'm see how kitra

414
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:27,709
kind of flows so the first thing that

415
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:29,449
makes keys are unique and different is

416
00:14:27,710 --> 00:14:31,520
that it's project based so instead of

417
00:14:29,450 --> 00:14:33,620
just bringing in one one binary you

418
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:35,180
actually create a project first and then

419
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:37,790
in that project you can bring in all the

420
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:39,979
binaries that you want to look at so in

421
00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:42,380
this case I brought it and say bin CP

422
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:43,930
into my into my project and because

423
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:47,060
that's the binary that I want to look at

424
00:14:43,930 --> 00:14:48,739
we also call this sometimes just our

425
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:50,569
front end we'll say open the front end

426
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:52,910
that's that's this window right here but

427
00:14:50,570 --> 00:14:54,410
it's technically the project window we

428
00:14:52,910 --> 00:14:55,640
called the front end because if you look

429
00:14:54,410 --> 00:14:57,319
at the code it's called the front end

430
00:14:55,640 --> 00:15:00,110
plug-in if you check out some of the

431
00:14:57,320 --> 00:15:01,910
code base so once you have your your

432
00:15:00,110 --> 00:15:03,560
binary brought into your project you can

433
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:05,240
then open it up in this first window

434
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:06,890
which is the listing view this is where

435
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:08,510
you do all your annotation and mark up

436
00:15:06,890 --> 00:15:10,850
the binary you create your instructions

437
00:15:08,510 --> 00:15:13,760
you create your data you lay down your

438
00:15:10,850 --> 00:15:16,580
comments this shows the function as a

439
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:17,900
linear flow of addresses so as you're

440
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:19,310
going down it's flowing down through the

441
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:21,430
address space so if you have a function

442
00:15:19,310 --> 00:15:24,170
that's not contiguous that's broken up

443
00:15:21,430 --> 00:15:25,760
we have another view that will render

444
00:15:24,170 --> 00:15:27,469
this as a graph so we have a function

445
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:29,870
graph which is giving you the same

446
00:15:27,470 --> 00:15:32,090
information as the listing view but it

447
00:15:29,870 --> 00:15:33,740
breaks it up by control flow so each so

448
00:15:32,090 --> 00:15:35,209
here's the one function we were looking

449
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:37,730
at on the previous slide but it's shown

450
00:15:35,209 --> 00:15:40,160
East control flow block so it's split up

451
00:15:37,730 --> 00:15:42,499
by transitions jumps branches things

452
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:44,929
like that and the way it's organized is

453
00:15:42,499 --> 00:15:47,179
actually by dominance so a node that's

454
00:15:44,929 --> 00:15:49,519
to the to the is below and to the right

455
00:15:47,179 --> 00:15:51,110
of another node means it's dominated by

456
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:53,540
that other node I mean and so like you

457
00:15:51,110 --> 00:15:55,790
can't reach that node unless you flow

458
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:57,860
through that like through the know

459
00:15:55,790 --> 00:15:59,990
that's that's upper you know up into the

460
00:15:57,860 --> 00:16:03,199
left of it down the bottom right hand

461
00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:04,369
corner and so is an overview because you

462
00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:06,319
can zoom out if you have a really

463
00:16:04,369 --> 00:16:08,269
complex function and you can see like

464
00:16:06,319 --> 00:16:09,920
just a small piece of a larger function

465
00:16:08,269 --> 00:16:13,999
and the bottom right hand corner will

466
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:15,319
show and overview of that then the same

467
00:16:13,999 --> 00:16:17,300
view that we just looked at before but

468
00:16:15,319 --> 00:16:19,279
we also have a D compiler that will take

469
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:22,368
that assembly code and D compile it into

470
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:24,199
a see like representation the cool thing

471
00:16:22,369 --> 00:16:25,970
about Deidre is the D compiler will work

472
00:16:24,199 --> 00:16:28,670
on any architecture that we support and

473
00:16:25,970 --> 00:16:30,889
and how we and by support I mean if we

474
00:16:28,670 --> 00:16:32,839
have a slay processor definition for

475
00:16:30,889 --> 00:16:35,600
that architecture slay is what we use

476
00:16:32,839 --> 00:16:37,309
it's a text based grammar where you can

477
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:39,529
outline the architecture you define the

478
00:16:37,309 --> 00:16:41,360
register the instructions the P code and

479
00:16:39,529 --> 00:16:43,160
the pecos what we call the micro code

480
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:45,319
for an instruction and that's how we can

481
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:47,990
actually decompile it from the assembly

482
00:16:45,319 --> 00:16:49,189
code back to AC like representation it

483
00:16:47,990 --> 00:16:50,629
goes through it through a few steps in

484
00:16:49,189 --> 00:16:51,939
the middle but generally speaking that's

485
00:16:50,629 --> 00:16:54,799
how that works

486
00:16:51,939 --> 00:16:57,319
another cool window we have is the file

487
00:16:54,799 --> 00:16:59,929
system browser this was introduced you

488
00:16:57,319 --> 00:17:01,368
know like later on after giedrius was

489
00:16:59,929 --> 00:17:03,429
created and it was it was designed to

490
00:17:01,369 --> 00:17:05,750
build a tear apart and open firmware

491
00:17:03,429 --> 00:17:07,309
inside of deidre so instead of just

492
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:09,679
bringing in one file you could have a

493
00:17:07,309 --> 00:17:11,869
tar file that has a bunch of binaries in

494
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:14,390
it and you can open that up inside of

495
00:17:11,869 --> 00:17:16,188
deidre and sort of alleviate the need to

496
00:17:14,390 --> 00:17:18,470
have an external tool to unpack

497
00:17:16,189 --> 00:17:21,140
something okay and there's a bunch of

498
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:22,459
formats that we support the other big

499
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:24,140
feature we have is the script manager

500
00:17:22,459 --> 00:17:25,970
this is really awesome

501
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:27,350
you can basically configure Ghidorah

502
00:17:25,970 --> 00:17:28,429
through the script manager to do

503
00:17:27,349 --> 00:17:31,129
anything you want you can automate

504
00:17:28,429 --> 00:17:33,620
things create new analyzers lay down

505
00:17:31,130 --> 00:17:36,590
code comments find functions you can

506
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:38,600
write scripts in Java and Python fun

507
00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:40,100
fact is when we first added this we

508
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:42,379
actually didn't have support for Python

509
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:44,510
and someone was like Java hate Java

510
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:45,679
why'd you do Java right which is kind of

511
00:17:44,510 --> 00:17:48,770
a theme we've heard a little bit about

512
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:51,080
Java and so one of our users actually

513
00:17:48,770 --> 00:17:53,510
the support for Python so if you wanted

514
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:55,520
to say add another language say Ruby you

515
00:17:53,510 --> 00:17:57,230
could drop in an extension to the script

516
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:59,379
framework and support other scripting

517
00:17:57,230 --> 00:18:04,310
languages as well as long as it has some

518
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:06,410
Java Java connection and then bringing

519
00:18:04,310 --> 00:18:08,300
it back to the bringing it back to the

520
00:18:06,410 --> 00:18:09,680
free headed you know like three things

521
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:12,710
working together here's the same three

522
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:14,930
views we saw a moment ago the listing on

523
00:18:12,710 --> 00:18:17,030
the left the D compiler in the center

524
00:18:14,930 --> 00:18:18,590
and the function graph on the right that

525
00:18:17,030 --> 00:18:20,750
and they're all working together so if I

526
00:18:18,590 --> 00:18:22,970
make a selection or make a change in any

527
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:24,800
of those windows it will propagate over

528
00:18:22,970 --> 00:18:27,200
to the other windows so if I wanted to

529
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:29,240
see you know this if statement here and

530
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:32,750
see where where you know which blocks

531
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:34,850
it's associated to where it is in the

532
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:37,100
listing in the in the in the bytes are

533
00:18:34,850 --> 00:18:39,199
the contiguous are they not as well as

534
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:41,740
in the decompiler it'll show me the the

535
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:44,180
transition points okay

536
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:46,460
you have a bunch of other features other

537
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:49,070
than just that we have an assembler that

538
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:51,650
allows you to like inline in the listing

539
00:18:49,070 --> 00:18:52,909
view right new assembly code we have

540
00:18:51,650 --> 00:18:54,710
bookmarks which are just what they are

541
00:18:52,910 --> 00:18:57,920
you can lay down little breadcrumbs at a

542
00:18:54,710 --> 00:18:59,600
place we have a byte viewer which is

543
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:01,460
which is what we call our hex editor

544
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:02,330
it's kind of like a hex editor but you

545
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:04,070
can do you can kind of do a little bit

546
00:19:02,330 --> 00:19:05,659
more than just change the bytes you can

547
00:19:04,070 --> 00:19:07,520
do them in different different bases

548
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:09,680
ascii and all kind of things we have a

549
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:13,190
datatype manager that allows you to

550
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:15,080
create union structures and apply those

551
00:19:13,190 --> 00:19:17,000
down on your binary we have an entropy

552
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:18,770
window this will show you how how

553
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,750
similar or difference your bytes are

554
00:19:18,770 --> 00:19:22,250
across a program it's really good for

555
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:24,620
figuring out if a program is compressed

556
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:27,290
say for example we have lots of ways to

557
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:28,310
do navigation and searching so that's so

558
00:19:27,290 --> 00:19:30,590
like you can move around your binary

559
00:19:28,310 --> 00:19:33,050
pretty you know in a multitude of ways

560
00:19:30,590 --> 00:19:35,600
to make finding things much much quicker

561
00:19:33,050 --> 00:19:37,700
version tracking is a really cool

562
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:39,679
feature so if you've done some sre on

563
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:42,740
version 1 of a binary in version 2 has

564
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:44,660
come out and you want to move as much

565
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:46,460
annotation forward as you can because

566
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:48,770
you assume that not everything's changed

567
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:51,500
between 100 and 200 urgent tracking is

568
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:54,020
used for that version control that's our

569
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:55,850
multi user so like if you were if you're

570
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:57,710
looking at a large binary like you can

571
00:19:55,850 --> 00:19:59,449
collaborate on it so I'm gonna do the

572
00:19:57,710 --> 00:20:00,770
first ten functions then you do the

573
00:19:59,450 --> 00:20:02,320
second ten function so it works out

574
00:20:00,770 --> 00:20:05,059
really well

575
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:06,620
so now that let's talk about some of our

576
00:20:05,059 --> 00:20:09,440
code base and how we implemented some of

577
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:11,659
the features I just talked about so our

578
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:14,419
code base is split up into sort of three

579
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:18,169
high-level categories framework which is

580
00:20:14,419 --> 00:20:20,450
the base GUI and storage components we

581
00:20:18,169 --> 00:20:22,549
have our features area which are all of

582
00:20:20,450 --> 00:20:25,370
the sre focus plugins and scripts that

583
00:20:22,549 --> 00:20:27,168
are specific for doing sre and then we

584
00:20:25,370 --> 00:20:29,389
have all of our processors which are all

585
00:20:27,169 --> 00:20:31,280
of the slay gram respects I told you

586
00:20:29,390 --> 00:20:33,980
about for defining architectures that

587
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:35,178
you want to disassemble so let's talk

588
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:36,260
about the framework a little bit and

589
00:20:35,179 --> 00:20:37,640
what because this will kind of help

590
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:40,158
understand why we call it a framework

591
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:42,770
and it's not just a tool so the

592
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:44,419
framework has five main components so

593
00:20:42,770 --> 00:20:47,090
it's kind of go through those so the

594
00:20:44,419 --> 00:20:48,559
first one is DB so as our database it's

595
00:20:47,090 --> 00:20:50,418
we call a database but it's probably not

596
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:52,730
a true database because we although we

597
00:20:50,419 --> 00:20:54,409
have tables rows and columns it's not

598
00:20:52,730 --> 00:20:55,940
really SQL like you can't run sequel

599
00:20:54,409 --> 00:20:58,070
statements on and things like that but

600
00:20:55,940 --> 00:21:01,039
we created it at a time when there

601
00:20:58,070 --> 00:21:02,299
really wasn't any good Java database

602
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:05,120
because it was a long time ago we made

603
00:21:02,299 --> 00:21:08,059
this but it was created so we could

604
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:09,889
support natively at a very low level the

605
00:21:08,059 --> 00:21:12,289
undo/redo and the version control all

606
00:21:09,890 --> 00:21:13,549
that is layered on top of the DB

607
00:21:12,289 --> 00:21:16,340
component okay

608
00:21:13,549 --> 00:21:19,309
now the model portion of the framework

609
00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:20,870
is tough is the is it's from like model

610
00:21:19,309 --> 00:21:22,070
view control from software design so

611
00:21:20,870 --> 00:21:25,729
that's the model it's the data that's

612
00:21:22,070 --> 00:21:28,158
inside of the project the so a project

613
00:21:25,730 --> 00:21:30,140
contains one or more domain folders and

614
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:32,539
one and each of those folders can have

615
00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:34,669
one or more domain files and a domain

616
00:21:32,539 --> 00:21:37,760
file is bound to a double into what we

617
00:21:34,669 --> 00:21:39,380
call a domain object and we have three

618
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:41,450
implementations of domain object that's

619
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:43,340
colluded with deidre one is program

620
00:21:41,450 --> 00:21:45,380
which is all of us all the stores for

621
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:46,908
storing a program all the programs

622
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:49,220
different information we'll see that in

623
00:21:46,909 --> 00:21:51,470
a minute now we also have data a data

624
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:52,850
type archives so you can make bundles of

625
00:21:51,470 --> 00:21:54,770
data type of archives and share those

626
00:21:52,850 --> 00:21:56,780
across users in your multi-user

627
00:21:54,770 --> 00:21:57,950
environment and version tracking

628
00:21:56,780 --> 00:22:00,470
sessions so if you start a version

629
00:21:57,950 --> 00:22:02,960
tracking session you can save that and

630
00:22:00,470 --> 00:22:05,450
come back and do it later

631
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:07,539
so part the reason why we call it a

632
00:22:05,450 --> 00:22:10,190
framework is you could create other

633
00:22:07,539 --> 00:22:11,658
other domain objects to store inside of

634
00:22:10,190 --> 00:22:15,210
here so it's a framework that could be

635
00:22:11,659 --> 00:22:17,760
reused for something say other than SRE

636
00:22:15,210 --> 00:22:19,920
the software modeling component is the

637
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:21,390
program I just mentioned before so it's

638
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:23,460
all of the classes that we've created

639
00:22:21,390 --> 00:22:25,200
that are used to model the the

640
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:27,360
information that's inside of a program

641
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:29,520
so a program contains memory which

642
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:31,800
contains bytes contains a symbol table

643
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:34,139
which contains symbols as well as

644
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:37,139
listing instructions it's it's very

645
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:39,530
large but it's I think it's modeled

646
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:42,570
pretty pretty pretty good I think

647
00:22:39,530 --> 00:22:45,300
plugins so what I'm speaking about here

648
00:22:42,570 --> 00:22:47,939
is the base class for the plugins that

649
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:50,129
are used so if you wanted to create your

650
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:52,380
own plug-in to drop into our framework

651
00:22:50,130 --> 00:22:54,540
this is where the base class and all the

652
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:56,940
base classes live that you would extend

653
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:59,550
from so the base class is called plug-in

654
00:22:56,940 --> 00:23:02,700
and plugins can produce and consume

655
00:22:59,550 --> 00:23:04,649
events so how like the screen I showed

656
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:06,930
you before where I had like the three

657
00:23:04,650 --> 00:23:10,080
window side by side how those windows

658
00:23:06,930 --> 00:23:12,510
talk together is one one plug-in will

659
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:14,730
say throw an event and the other windows

660
00:23:12,510 --> 00:23:17,250
will consume that event and respond so

661
00:23:14,730 --> 00:23:19,800
like address changes location changes

662
00:23:17,250 --> 00:23:22,830
things like that plugins are also

663
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:24,810
dependent on each other by decoupling

664
00:23:22,830 --> 00:23:26,610
them through a thing we call services so

665
00:23:24,810 --> 00:23:28,679
I plugin will produce a service and

666
00:23:26,610 --> 00:23:30,899
other plugins will consume that service

667
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:32,970
that way plugins are not dependent on

668
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:36,270
each other so if you wanted to take out

669
00:23:32,970 --> 00:23:37,470
say our go to service that's inside of

670
00:23:36,270 --> 00:23:39,389
gage which is which controls the

671
00:23:37,470 --> 00:23:42,420
navigation you could write a new one and

672
00:23:39,390 --> 00:23:43,890
and provide the go to service and drop

673
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:45,630
that in and the rest of the environment

674
00:23:43,890 --> 00:23:48,090
would would still respond appropriately

675
00:23:45,630 --> 00:23:51,300
and work correctly plugins are also

676
00:23:48,090 --> 00:23:53,669
responsible for managing the gooeys all

677
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:55,379
the buttons all the actions so that's

678
00:23:53,670 --> 00:23:57,000
kind of the separation between a script

679
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:59,970
what I mentioned before and a plug-in if

680
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:01,890
you want to do anything that's Bui based

681
00:23:59,970 --> 00:24:03,240
you should do it as a plugin not as a

682
00:24:01,890 --> 00:24:05,490
script otherwise you can do anything

683
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:08,910
else in the script it's kind of our our

684
00:24:05,490 --> 00:24:11,580
separation on that docking windows is

685
00:24:08,910 --> 00:24:13,590
our suite of custom GUI components that

686
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:14,879
we've created so we have if you're

687
00:24:13,590 --> 00:24:17,669
familiar with Java you know there's J

688
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:19,230
components of J table J tree we've

689
00:24:17,670 --> 00:24:21,980
extended a whole bunch of those we have

690
00:24:19,230 --> 00:24:24,210
G trees and G tables which are our

691
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:27,030
components to make the environment look

692
00:24:24,210 --> 00:24:28,800
sim you know looks similar across across

693
00:24:27,030 --> 00:24:30,540
gauges so all of our tables look to say

694
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:33,870
all of our trees look the same because

695
00:24:30,540 --> 00:24:35,399
we use the G tree so and that the reason

696
00:24:33,870 --> 00:24:37,590
to do we want to use that it gives you

697
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:38,970
things like improve table modeling and

698
00:24:37,590 --> 00:24:40,350
tree modeling which goes back to what

699
00:24:38,970 --> 00:24:42,000
Chris was mentioning earlier about

700
00:24:40,350 --> 00:24:43,740
needing this scale so if you have a

701
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,060
binary that has 5 million symbols in it

702
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:47,130
and you're trying to open it in

703
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:49,080
traditional Java GUI components it would

704
00:24:47,130 --> 00:24:51,480
never happen because the table model

705
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:53,879
would not support that so we have a

706
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:55,920
bunch of threaded models for all of

707
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:57,960
those things also does sorting filtering

708
00:24:55,920 --> 00:25:00,600
gives us the nice uniform look and feel

709
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:04,590
and yes it was created to overcome a lot

710
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:06,000
of Java swing sort of wonkiness so

711
00:25:04,590 --> 00:25:07,919
here's an example of that going back to

712
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:10,980
the script manager you can see on the

713
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:13,800
right hand side is the G table and the

714
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:16,320
left hand side is the G tree and all of

715
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:18,990
those like the sorting the filtering you

716
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:20,159
know all that stuff is if you use G like

717
00:25:18,990 --> 00:25:21,840
one of our key components you'll kind of

718
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:23,550
get that for free which saves you a lot

719
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:27,510
of time and doing all the GUI components

720
00:25:23,550 --> 00:25:29,370
like all the development of those so big

721
00:25:27,510 --> 00:25:30,750
question we've got a lot is why did we

722
00:25:29,370 --> 00:25:33,300
pick Java what were you thinking you

723
00:25:30,750 --> 00:25:35,490
know kind of thing well when we started

724
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:38,159
at Java was was very popular right it

725
00:25:35,490 --> 00:25:41,700
was early 2000 I came on the project

726
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:43,410
like I said in 2001 before we did it in

727
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:45,720
Java and I wasn't on that I wasn't

728
00:25:43,410 --> 00:25:47,370
involved that C++ was tried but it

729
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:49,500
didn't really give us the platform

730
00:25:47,370 --> 00:25:52,620
independent GUI from the start which is

731
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:53,730
what we needed so and of course Java

732
00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:55,500
gives us a lot of cool features like

733
00:25:53,730 --> 00:25:58,620
being able to load classes dynamically

734
00:25:55,500 --> 00:26:00,150
that's how the scripts work also gives

735
00:25:58,620 --> 00:26:01,379
us extension points you can drop in new

736
00:26:00,150 --> 00:26:03,210
plugins if you if you write your own

737
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:05,700
plugins and it'll just it'll just load

738
00:26:03,210 --> 00:26:08,880
them automatically Java gives us minimal

739
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:10,980
memory management there's you know it

740
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:14,310
still has some memory link Possible's

741
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:16,410
but now if we if we started it if we

742
00:26:14,310 --> 00:26:17,669
started it today what we still use Java

743
00:26:16,410 --> 00:26:19,530
I think the answer is yes but we

744
00:26:17,670 --> 00:26:21,090
probably do some things differently we

745
00:26:19,530 --> 00:26:23,580
would certainly make everything be able

746
00:26:21,090 --> 00:26:25,590
to be written in say Python so plugins

747
00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:28,379
could be written in Python analyzers

748
00:26:25,590 --> 00:26:30,270
loaders but one of the cool things is

749
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:32,970
Java gave us from the beginning was if

750
00:26:30,270 --> 00:26:35,670
you have a distribution of deidre and

751
00:26:32,970 --> 00:26:37,140
you have say eclipse you can debug that

752
00:26:35,670 --> 00:26:39,510
distribution so if someone was using

753
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:42,120
deidre and say call me up hey Brian you

754
00:26:39,510 --> 00:26:42,540
know it's not working right on my binary

755
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:43,679
I could just

756
00:26:42,540 --> 00:26:45,180
go to their desk without having to take

757
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:47,340
some big development environment I can

758
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:49,200
just fire up eclipse at their desk and

759
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:51,209
debug the source code that we include

760
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:52,860
with Deidre just debug it you know where

761
00:26:51,210 --> 00:26:54,330
I didn't write in place and then maybe

762
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:56,729
even patch it right there at their desk

763
00:26:54,330 --> 00:26:57,899
so they can keep working then we will

764
00:26:56,730 --> 00:27:01,200
come back and integrate that into our

765
00:26:57,900 --> 00:27:04,050
code base later on so the open source

766
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:05,070
process let's talk about that well

767
00:27:04,050 --> 00:27:07,800
before we talk about that let's talk

768
00:27:05,070 --> 00:27:10,770
about every version of Deidre that we've

769
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:13,200
had okay so and so we started it say

770
00:27:10,770 --> 00:27:15,870
early say early or late 2000 I came on

771
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:17,490
and say mid mid 2001 is when I was when

772
00:27:15,870 --> 00:27:20,489
I joined the team and when we first

773
00:27:17,490 --> 00:27:23,220
started it yes it was classified it was

774
00:27:20,490 --> 00:27:25,380
classified because factor of NSA doing

775
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:28,380
Sree was considered classified therefore

776
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:31,770
a tool that does SRT sre would

777
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:35,520
inherently be classified we had our

778
00:27:31,770 --> 00:27:38,010
first version version 1.0 in 2003 it was

779
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:39,450
mostly proof-of-concept it was kind of

780
00:27:38,010 --> 00:27:42,629
just getting the framework laid out the

781
00:27:39,450 --> 00:27:45,530
ability to have plugins and analyzers

782
00:27:42,630 --> 00:27:49,410
and loaders it wasn't wasn't very good

783
00:27:45,530 --> 00:27:50,639
but in 2004 we came out with version 2

784
00:27:49,410 --> 00:27:52,970
and this was getting a lot better this

785
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:55,440
is when we added the database and

786
00:27:52,970 --> 00:27:56,760
docking windows so before the database

787
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:59,460
we were actually just writing out the

788
00:27:56,760 --> 00:28:01,560
Java classes to disk and we had undo

789
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:03,690
from the beginning but the undo worked

790
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:05,909
didn't work very well so by using the

791
00:28:03,690 --> 00:28:08,580
database we were able to do it much much

792
00:28:05,910 --> 00:28:10,140
easier the plugins that are layered on

793
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:12,929
top of the database didn't need to know

794
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:16,380
how to undo where to which is what had

795
00:28:12,930 --> 00:28:17,580
which is what happened in 1.0 so then we

796
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:19,380
also introduced the docking windows

797
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:21,960
which was really just the ability to

798
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:25,200
pull the windows out from the main code

799
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:27,200
browser window and move them around as

800
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:30,570
well as some of the java components in

801
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:33,390
2006 we came out with version 3 which

802
00:28:30,570 --> 00:28:35,189
was included slay in the D compiler so

803
00:28:33,390 --> 00:28:36,720
in versions 1 and 2 we didn't have any

804
00:28:35,190 --> 00:28:39,570
compiler yet we could use like you could

805
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:41,700
only disassemble so in inverse of 3 we

806
00:28:39,570 --> 00:28:43,320
introduced the D compiler and also

807
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:46,260
version control which is the multi-user

808
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:47,909
which was layered on top of the database

809
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:49,410
so because we added the database were

810
00:28:47,910 --> 00:28:51,060
able to then support and implement

811
00:28:49,410 --> 00:28:52,530
something that we wanted to do from the

812
00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:56,580
beginning which was the multi-user

813
00:28:52,530 --> 00:28:58,139
collaboration 2007 version 4 came

814
00:28:56,580 --> 00:29:01,379
two big things that were added that was

815
00:28:58,140 --> 00:29:03,450
the scripting and framework both the

816
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:05,520
Java and the Python if someone had it

817
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:07,410
the Python very quickly after after we

818
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:09,800
kind of had some some betas of it

819
00:29:07,410 --> 00:29:11,850
version tracking was also introduced

820
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:15,300
which is the build going from version

821
00:29:11,850 --> 00:29:18,389
one to version two of a binary it's 2010

822
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:20,340
we had a 5.0 then one of the biggest

823
00:29:18,390 --> 00:29:23,100
things that was added that was the file

824
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:24,810
system browser that was introduced you

825
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:26,669
know to deal with the firmware bundles

826
00:29:24,810 --> 00:29:28,080
which are which were becoming very

827
00:29:26,670 --> 00:29:30,150
prevalent like before that it was always

828
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:31,800
just one binary one binary I'm gonna

829
00:29:30,150 --> 00:29:33,000
look at this one binary but now we have

830
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:34,200
bundles of firmware that you want to

831
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:37,410
look at and be able to tether the part

832
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:39,750
and bring that into gear so you'd have

833
00:29:37,410 --> 00:29:41,940
to have a bunch of different tools to to

834
00:29:39,750 --> 00:29:45,180
look at it the big the big thing though

835
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:46,740
in 2000 in 2014 I should say six plio

836
00:29:45,180 --> 00:29:49,110
came out and this was our unclassified

837
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:51,330
version the reason it changed from

838
00:29:49,110 --> 00:29:53,729
classified unclassified is fact of like

839
00:29:51,330 --> 00:29:55,860
I mentioned before the fact of NSA doing

840
00:29:53,730 --> 00:29:59,370
sre had become unclassified therefore we

841
00:29:55,860 --> 00:30:00,810
were able to declassify deidre but we

842
00:29:59,370 --> 00:30:03,449
were still we still weren't ready to you

843
00:30:00,810 --> 00:30:05,669
know release it yet over the next five

844
00:30:03,450 --> 00:30:07,440
years we worked from the process of

845
00:30:05,670 --> 00:30:09,210
unclassified at the open source now I

846
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:10,920
don't think at five years that's a long

847
00:30:09,210 --> 00:30:13,110
time but it wasn't like our full time

848
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:14,970
job we were still supporting deidre we

849
00:30:13,110 --> 00:30:17,310
had version 7 in version 8 come out with

850
00:30:14,970 --> 00:30:19,380
lots of features lots of bugs but you

851
00:30:17,310 --> 00:30:21,750
know bug fixes improvements and then you

852
00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:24,630
know we were we were like transitioning

853
00:30:21,750 --> 00:30:27,750
to the open source to get there which if

854
00:30:24,630 --> 00:30:29,490
you may have heard 2019 this past March

855
00:30:27,750 --> 00:30:32,460
we were able to finally release the

856
00:30:29,490 --> 00:30:35,220
first public version of deidre and the

857
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:40,170
source code was put on github one month

858
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:41,460
later ok somebody give it back back he's

859
00:30:40,170 --> 00:30:45,060
gonna talk some more about open source

860
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:46,380
ok so don't get scared the policy stuff

861
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:50,100
we're not going to go to too deep into

862
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:51,330
this but thought it would be useful at

863
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:53,370
least to sort of point to a couple

864
00:30:51,330 --> 00:30:54,810
government policies that we utilized to

865
00:30:53,370 --> 00:30:57,449
kind of help push ski-doo over the

866
00:30:54,810 --> 00:31:01,350
finish line so to speak and so negative

867
00:30:57,450 --> 00:31:03,240
order 13 691 is one of those you can see

868
00:31:01,350 --> 00:31:04,770
cybersecurity sharing right the second

869
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:07,880
bullet we were able to kind of point to

870
00:31:04,770 --> 00:31:07,879
the second bullet and say look

871
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:12,549
using the same tool across different

872
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:14,620
groups is really going to improve the

873
00:31:12,549 --> 00:31:16,870
ability to share right so just it just

874
00:31:14,620 --> 00:31:19,239
it makes sense here we're gonna we're

875
00:31:16,870 --> 00:31:20,559
looking at the same binaries we're all

876
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:21,820
gonna look at it the same way there's

877
00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:23,460
not going to be any communication

878
00:31:21,820 --> 00:31:25,720
breakdowns

879
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:26,920
it's just seem like like like it made

880
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:28,600
sense that we could point to this policy

881
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:30,580
and then there's voluntary partnering

882
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:32,639
with the federal government obviously if

883
00:31:30,580 --> 00:31:35,530
you're using the tool that we wrote

884
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:38,919
that's going to enable you to work more

885
00:31:35,530 --> 00:31:41,049
easily with us the other policy I want

886
00:31:38,919 --> 00:31:44,830
to do to underline here was this open

887
00:31:41,049 --> 00:31:46,600
source policy now very large

888
00:31:44,830 --> 00:31:48,699
organizations can be inefficient at

889
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:50,649
times the government is no different

890
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:53,260
keeping track of all the custom software

891
00:31:50,650 --> 00:31:55,059
projects that are started up and torn

892
00:31:53,260 --> 00:31:57,220
down and released within the federal

893
00:31:55,059 --> 00:31:59,830
government at large it's an it's an

894
00:31:57,220 --> 00:32:01,299
enormous effort and so what this tries

895
00:31:59,830 --> 00:32:05,889
to address is some of that inefficiency

896
00:32:01,299 --> 00:32:07,690
and and make useful custom projects

897
00:32:05,890 --> 00:32:09,370
available to the government large and so

898
00:32:07,690 --> 00:32:11,590
what we did here is sort of point to

899
00:32:09,370 --> 00:32:12,729
this and say look not everybody works in

900
00:32:11,590 --> 00:32:13,659
classified environment across the

901
00:32:12,730 --> 00:32:15,940
government we make this thing

902
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:17,290
open-source put it out there and it's

903
00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:18,309
going to be available to more parts

904
00:32:17,290 --> 00:32:20,350
within the government as well as

905
00:32:18,309 --> 00:32:22,389
external to the government and it's just

906
00:32:20,350 --> 00:32:23,379
it's better overall for all the

907
00:32:22,390 --> 00:32:25,960
different groups we don't have to worry

908
00:32:23,380 --> 00:32:27,580
about other agencies trying to build a

909
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:31,679
reverse engineering framework for

910
00:32:27,580 --> 00:32:31,678
whatever reason we've already got one

911
00:32:31,710 --> 00:32:37,780
now as Ryan said it took five years now

912
00:32:36,309 --> 00:32:39,730
what exactly was going on in those five

913
00:32:37,780 --> 00:32:41,730
years well there's a lot to think about

914
00:32:39,730 --> 00:32:43,990
if you're thinking about a large-scale

915
00:32:41,730 --> 00:32:46,090
software project like huge or a million

916
00:32:43,990 --> 00:32:47,770
lines of code or so and everybody's

917
00:32:46,090 --> 00:32:49,600
every lines got to be looked at by two

918
00:32:47,770 --> 00:32:52,240
people so this is a process we had to go

919
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:54,580
through it's slow but not just that

920
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:56,650
think about any sort of internal

921
00:32:54,580 --> 00:32:59,139
software project that you've got

922
00:32:56,650 --> 00:33:00,490
in-house for a decade or more never seen

923
00:32:59,140 --> 00:33:01,929
the light of day for whatever reason you

924
00:33:00,490 --> 00:33:04,270
got a building on that old box in the

925
00:33:01,929 --> 00:33:06,250
corner dependencies everything is kind

926
00:33:04,270 --> 00:33:07,540
of set and now all of a sudden you want

927
00:33:06,250 --> 00:33:09,220
to make it open source so that anybody

928
00:33:07,540 --> 00:33:12,190
can download and build it at home and

929
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:13,570
set it up that's a lot of effort so we

930
00:33:12,190 --> 00:33:16,090
had to deal with a lot of build scripts

931
00:33:13,570 --> 00:33:17,470
documentation the process internal

932
00:33:16,090 --> 00:33:19,510
infrastructure had to be stood up to

933
00:33:17,470 --> 00:33:20,480
test everything this was an enormous

934
00:33:19,510 --> 00:33:22,369
effort

935
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:24,230
an enormous a number of people were

936
00:33:22,369 --> 00:33:26,259
involved the Geezer team public-affairs

937
00:33:24,230 --> 00:33:29,869
got involved got something with us today

938
00:33:26,259 --> 00:33:31,340
and OGC that's the office of general

939
00:33:29,869 --> 00:33:32,988
counsel that's lawyers we had to get

940
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:33,789
involved with them as well it's a huge

941
00:33:32,989 --> 00:33:36,649
team effort

942
00:33:33,789 --> 00:33:38,929
and we're really really excited that we

943
00:33:36,649 --> 00:33:42,820
were able to to get it out and be able

944
00:33:38,929 --> 00:33:45,859
to do this type of presentation and so

945
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:50,149
sort of harkening to the anniversary of

946
00:33:45,859 --> 00:33:51,470
the the moon landing every 50 years or

947
00:33:50,149 --> 00:33:52,908
so the government gets to do something

948
00:33:51,470 --> 00:33:55,999
awesome right that's kind of what we're

949
00:33:52,909 --> 00:33:57,889
pointing out this it's it's not we're

950
00:33:55,999 --> 00:34:00,499
not trying to equate releasing an

951
00:33:57,889 --> 00:34:02,559
open-source project with landing on the

952
00:34:00,499 --> 00:34:05,600
moon or anything like that if that

953
00:34:02,559 --> 00:34:07,668
ultimately this was a moon shot for us

954
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:09,409
though and when it went down we had it

955
00:34:07,669 --> 00:34:12,559
we have this big build up a lot of time

956
00:34:09,409 --> 00:34:14,540
as you saw to get to that point we had

957
00:34:12,559 --> 00:34:16,940
people in on the ground so to speak in

958
00:34:14,540 --> 00:34:19,009
RSA at the conference at the booth

959
00:34:16,940 --> 00:34:21,440
waiting for the influx of people to come

960
00:34:19,010 --> 00:34:23,629
over and ask questions we had a big team

961
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:26,210
back home admission control sort of

962
00:34:23,629 --> 00:34:28,279
online answering online questions

963
00:34:26,210 --> 00:34:30,079
watching the download count tick up and

964
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:32,179
it was just it was an enormous amount of

965
00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:36,609
excitement everybody was we loved it it

966
00:34:32,179 --> 00:34:39,230
was great but why did we do it well we

967
00:34:36,609 --> 00:34:41,149
believe the cybersecurity is a big issue

968
00:34:39,230 --> 00:34:43,280
and we want to do as much as you can to

969
00:34:41,149 --> 00:34:44,540
kind of help out and so getting this

970
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:46,730
tool out there is one of those things

971
00:34:44,540 --> 00:34:47,808
but we also really want to embrace the

972
00:34:46,730 --> 00:34:49,668
open source community

973
00:34:47,809 --> 00:34:52,760
we love open source the people that work

974
00:34:49,668 --> 00:34:54,589
at NSA our open source type people we

975
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:55,940
like to be able to give back when we can

976
00:34:54,589 --> 00:34:58,460
as much as we can

977
00:34:55,940 --> 00:35:00,890
it enables us it enables you it's a it's

978
00:34:58,460 --> 00:35:04,369
a good thing we're excited about seeing

979
00:35:00,890 --> 00:35:08,089
this tool in schools trainings are

980
00:35:04,369 --> 00:35:10,040
popping up online YouTube videos it's

981
00:35:08,089 --> 00:35:12,200
being attached to curriculums we think

982
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:13,609
this is all fantastic I mean it doesn't

983
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:15,680
hurt for recruitment purposes but

984
00:35:13,609 --> 00:35:18,109
ultimately we want to work with Roma

985
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:20,930
tours we're friends of omote were fans

986
00:35:18,109 --> 00:35:22,790
of open source and we wanted to show our

987
00:35:20,930 --> 00:35:24,618
commitment to the community with this

988
00:35:22,790 --> 00:35:28,490
release and our continuing support and

989
00:35:24,619 --> 00:35:31,040
engagement you know I think the fact

990
00:35:28,490 --> 00:35:34,430
Iran new features so we've got some new

991
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:36,920
stuff coming out I 9.1

992
00:35:34,430 --> 00:35:38,450
9.12 be coming out soon I'm not gonna

993
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:41,570
say exactly when but but very soon

994
00:35:38,450 --> 00:35:43,370
eminently and in 9.1 we're gonna have

995
00:35:41,570 --> 00:35:46,160
some additional processor modules which

996
00:35:43,370 --> 00:35:48,410
are the slave specifications we're gonna

997
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:51,680
have like say super age for some of the

998
00:35:48,410 --> 00:35:54,140
HTS processors we're gonna have support

999
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:57,350
for data type bid fields this is this is

1000
00:35:54,140 --> 00:35:58,850
in for a structure you can specify bit

1001
00:35:57,350 --> 00:36:01,370
fields inside of a structure or Union

1002
00:35:58,850 --> 00:36:03,200
we've wanted that for a long time I've

1003
00:36:01,370 --> 00:36:05,060
also have support for sis calls and a

1004
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:06,919
slay editor if you want to know more

1005
00:36:05,060 --> 00:36:08,990
about that check out the Recon talk that

1006
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:10,310
was a few months ago there were some

1007
00:36:08,990 --> 00:36:13,009
folks from the get your team who gave a

1008
00:36:10,310 --> 00:36:14,990
talk on once it's call & slay editor

1009
00:36:13,010 --> 00:36:15,740
some of the future things we have coming

1010
00:36:14,990 --> 00:36:18,470
out

1011
00:36:15,740 --> 00:36:21,350
no no projected release date is support

1012
00:36:18,470 --> 00:36:23,180
for the latest Android in art formats

1013
00:36:21,350 --> 00:36:24,920
we're gonna have an alpha of our

1014
00:36:23,180 --> 00:36:26,089
debugger they were gonna hoping to put

1015
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:28,010
out so people can use it and see what

1016
00:36:26,090 --> 00:36:30,140
they think and we're hoping for some

1017
00:36:28,010 --> 00:36:32,210
more external engagements maybe some

1018
00:36:30,140 --> 00:36:33,440
more bug fixes you know kind of working

1019
00:36:32,210 --> 00:36:37,670
on those together as an open source

1020
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:39,770
community so let's talk about the o tart

1021
00:36:37,670 --> 00:36:41,210
support so we've kind of just said a

1022
00:36:39,770 --> 00:36:42,380
bunch of like you know sort of

1023
00:36:41,210 --> 00:36:44,690
high-level stuff we kind of wanted to

1024
00:36:42,380 --> 00:36:46,880
show you know some some VR knowledge on

1025
00:36:44,690 --> 00:36:49,880
our part for this brief so currently

1026
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:52,250
Geezer supports the the dalvik based

1027
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:54,260
versions of Android the Dex executable -

1028
00:36:52,250 --> 00:36:56,090
Oh Dex which is the optimized all Vega

1029
00:36:54,260 --> 00:36:58,480
executable format the current of support

1030
00:36:56,090 --> 00:37:01,490
for those in the engage era right now

1031
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:03,830
we're gonna be adding support for the

1032
00:37:01,490 --> 00:37:06,319
the bootloader format this will be in in

1033
00:37:03,830 --> 00:37:08,120
the form of a new G filesystem for the

1034
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:11,030
filesystem browser we're gonna have

1035
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:13,970
support for the natively compiled Oh Dex

1036
00:37:11,030 --> 00:37:16,040
files so so Oh Dex has been overloaded

1037
00:37:13,970 --> 00:37:17,899
starting with lollipop actually came out

1038
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:19,430
a little before lollipop but mostly was

1039
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:22,490
very fairly highly prevalent in volley

1040
00:37:19,430 --> 00:37:27,049
in the inversion of Android lollipop 5

1041
00:37:22,490 --> 00:37:28,939
oh where the the the java application is

1042
00:37:27,050 --> 00:37:31,070
said being compiled to an optimized or

1043
00:37:28,940 --> 00:37:33,380
to the dalvik VM and then optimized as a

1044
00:37:31,070 --> 00:37:35,530
still at avec vm executable it's now

1045
00:37:33,380 --> 00:37:38,330
compiled natively as an elf arm

1046
00:37:35,530 --> 00:37:39,620
application to run on the device so

1047
00:37:38,330 --> 00:37:41,420
we're gonna have some analyzers for that

1048
00:37:39,620 --> 00:37:43,310
as well as the ode in the art formats

1049
00:37:41,420 --> 00:37:45,590
and some of the other ones like V decks

1050
00:37:43,310 --> 00:37:47,960
and C decks was to verify and compact

1051
00:37:45,590 --> 00:37:49,040
Dex files so let's take a look at

1052
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:50,990
what this is kind of look like so we're

1053
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:53,020
gonna have the ability to open the

1054
00:37:50,990 --> 00:37:55,430
bootloader

1055
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:57,470
binary inside of the G filesystem and

1056
00:37:55,430 --> 00:37:58,640
pull out the pieces like the a boot the

1057
00:37:57,470 --> 00:38:00,500
secondary bootloader and things like

1058
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:02,029
that so then you can in from this window

1059
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:05,240
drag them out and drop them in your

1060
00:38:02,030 --> 00:38:07,099
listing to do some analysis on them

1061
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:09,140
whilst we have support for the new o Dex

1062
00:38:07,099 --> 00:38:12,800
format like I mentioned which is now the

1063
00:38:09,140 --> 00:38:14,330
natively compiled application so what

1064
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:15,980
we're looking at right here is two of

1065
00:38:14,330 --> 00:38:17,569
the magic symbols that are inside of

1066
00:38:15,980 --> 00:38:19,910
that binary this is oak data this is

1067
00:38:17,570 --> 00:38:21,260
enough in the dot ro data section we're

1068
00:38:19,910 --> 00:38:23,779
gonna have some analyzers that will lay

1069
00:38:21,260 --> 00:38:25,609
down the data structure for that format

1070
00:38:23,780 --> 00:38:28,099
and then we're gonna use this

1071
00:38:25,609 --> 00:38:30,290
information to pull out say all of the

1072
00:38:28,099 --> 00:38:32,720
symbol names that are inside of the what

1073
00:38:30,290 --> 00:38:35,570
was the leftover Java VM stuff which is

1074
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:37,580
all the function names and classes so we

1075
00:38:35,570 --> 00:38:39,950
can go to the other magic symbol which

1076
00:38:37,580 --> 00:38:42,440
is owed exec which is in the dot text

1077
00:38:39,950 --> 00:38:44,779
section and we can analyze the code and

1078
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:47,119
lay down all of the data structures that

1079
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:49,280
are there as well as all of the symbol

1080
00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:51,800
names that were pulled out of the out

1081
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:53,839
there on the oak data area so look for

1082
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:55,160
that pretty soon but I won't say how

1083
00:38:53,839 --> 00:38:57,849
long cuz not sure when you know when

1084
00:38:55,160 --> 00:39:03,500
will when will have it for for release

1085
00:38:57,849 --> 00:39:05,599
so some metrics we've got we've we've

1086
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:08,450
gotten a lot more downloads than we

1087
00:39:05,599 --> 00:39:11,660
would have thought of we have just over

1088
00:39:08,450 --> 00:39:16,580
500,000 downloads when we when we had

1089
00:39:11,660 --> 00:39:18,319
the the release go live at at RSA we

1090
00:39:16,580 --> 00:39:20,299
kind of had an internal like you know

1091
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:23,030
sort of sort of bet but like how many

1092
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:25,550
downloads you think it'll be it was my

1093
00:39:23,030 --> 00:39:26,839
my number was way low I was very you

1094
00:39:25,550 --> 00:39:29,240
know just just super humbled by the

1095
00:39:26,839 --> 00:39:30,710
number of downloads that we've gotten of

1096
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:33,109
course we have a bunch we have we've had

1097
00:39:30,710 --> 00:39:35,390
a lot of pull requests on github a lot

1098
00:39:33,109 --> 00:39:38,450
of bug fixes things like that which have

1099
00:39:35,390 --> 00:39:40,640
been awesome so thank you for that so

1100
00:39:38,450 --> 00:39:44,509
some of the public impact turn it over

1101
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:46,279
to Chris I thought we both had something

1102
00:39:44,510 --> 00:39:48,500
to say here but ultimately I think we've

1103
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:50,630
been super impressed with the amount of

1104
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:53,839
people who've gotten involved it's

1105
00:39:50,630 --> 00:39:56,810
really been beyond our expectations the

1106
00:39:53,839 --> 00:39:59,690
number of people that actually learned

1107
00:39:56,810 --> 00:40:02,240
the slay yeah language and were able to

1108
00:39:59,690 --> 00:40:06,200
incorporate new processor MA

1109
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:08,540
for us was I don't know we just we

1110
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:12,230
didn't expect that we're really really

1111
00:40:08,540 --> 00:40:14,779
excited about having more people help

1112
00:40:12,230 --> 00:40:17,630
help us out with with the code finding

1113
00:40:14,780 --> 00:40:19,580
bugs and the code reporting problems and

1114
00:40:17,630 --> 00:40:22,400
making it better I mean part of what

1115
00:40:19,580 --> 00:40:24,230
we're trying to leverage by entering or

1116
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:26,900
getting the tool in the open-source

1117
00:40:24,230 --> 00:40:28,430
community is the creativity and the the

1118
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:30,800
innovation that you guys can help us

1119
00:40:28,430 --> 00:40:31,879
with by giving us maybe things we hadn't

1120
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:34,070
thought about like I was talking about

1121
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:35,210
earlier we may not have thought of a lot

1122
00:40:34,070 --> 00:40:37,940
of things you guys have probably thought

1123
00:40:35,210 --> 00:40:39,980
about to do and so we really want to get

1124
00:40:37,940 --> 00:40:41,869
as much help from the public as we can

1125
00:40:39,980 --> 00:40:43,610
with this tool I think that's that's one

1126
00:40:41,869 --> 00:40:45,470
of the biggest sub is taking away things

1127
00:40:43,610 --> 00:40:47,210
maybes god it's a group effort we all

1128
00:40:45,470 --> 00:40:48,830
need to work together you know to help

1129
00:40:47,210 --> 00:40:50,630
help improve cybersecurity so this is

1130
00:40:48,830 --> 00:40:52,250
kind of our contribution we hope we can

1131
00:40:50,630 --> 00:40:55,400
you know work together more going

1132
00:40:52,250 --> 00:40:58,670
forward so thanks for everyone who's

1133
00:40:55,400 --> 00:41:01,220
worked I'll have rated so far if you

1134
00:40:58,670 --> 00:41:03,710
want to contact us the Geezer team is

1135
00:41:01,220 --> 00:41:05,060
not owned anything but github so if you

1136
00:41:03,710 --> 00:41:07,700
want to contact the guiter team

1137
00:41:05,060 --> 00:41:09,410
you can go out to our github page we're

1138
00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:11,600
not on Twitter or anything or anything

1139
00:41:09,410 --> 00:41:12,560
like that that may change at some point

1140
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:15,799

room if you like to ask a question hey

1173
00:42:43,299 --> 00:42:47,099
all I have a question here in the center

1174
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:55,390
I can't yeah okay um can you are you

1175
00:42:53,019 --> 00:42:57,129
explained that you're a big fan of open

1176
00:42:55,390 --> 00:42:58,808
source software but I had imagined

1177
00:42:57,130 --> 00:43:02,019
during that five-year release process

1178
00:42:58,809 --> 00:43:04,720
you ran into some approvers or reviewers

1179
00:43:02,019 --> 00:43:06,490
who didn't really understand open source

1180
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:09,669
software and maybe didn't necessarily

1181
00:43:06,490 --> 00:43:10,988
want it to be released open source can

1182
00:43:09,670 --> 00:43:13,749
you talk about some of those challenges

1183
00:43:10,989 --> 00:43:14,890
and how you overcame them I don't think

1184
00:43:13,749 --> 00:43:38,950
I caught I don't think I really hear the

1185
00:43:14,890 --> 00:43:41,339
question what was the could you up I

1186
00:43:38,950 --> 00:43:44,379
mean I don't think there are really

1187
00:43:41,339 --> 00:43:45,640
objections per se but I mean there was

1188
00:43:44,380 --> 00:43:47,109
there was there was there was more

1189
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:49,420
technical challenges for us to figure

1190
00:43:47,109 --> 00:43:50,710
out because we we were excited to be

1191
00:43:49,420 --> 00:43:52,499
able to start working open source

1192
00:43:50,710 --> 00:43:55,059
because we hadn't worked that way before

1193
00:43:52,499 --> 00:43:57,700
so it's more figuring out like how to

1194
00:43:55,059 --> 00:43:58,900
how to best do it from from from our

1195
00:43:57,700 --> 00:44:00,939
standpoint cuz we hadn't worked that way

1196
00:43:58,900 --> 00:44:02,769
before so figuring out you know should

1197
00:44:00,940 --> 00:44:04,989
we be on github should we be you know

1198
00:44:02,769 --> 00:44:06,640
Apache 200 is their license you know all

1199
00:44:04,989 --> 00:44:11,529
those kinds of things we're sort of more

1200
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:14,910
the challenges that we had to do I have

1201
00:44:11,529 --> 00:44:17,460
a question here here

1202
00:44:14,910 --> 00:44:20,098
okay okay I'll see ya there so my

1203
00:44:17,460 --> 00:44:22,019
question is what we source or

1204
00:44:20,099 --> 00:44:25,410
documentation do you recommend to become

1205
00:44:22,019 --> 00:44:31,319
proficient in the school what was the

1206
00:44:25,410 --> 00:44:33,629
question again sorry Kate here I stand

1207
00:44:31,319 --> 00:44:36,599
good question so inside of the Geezer

1208
00:44:33,630 --> 00:44:39,390
distribution it's also on the D dress re

1209
00:44:36,599 --> 00:44:42,720
site we have lots of documentation we

1210
00:44:39,390 --> 00:44:46,140
have three classes we have a beginner

1211
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:47,879
and intermediate class which is for for

1212
00:44:46,140 --> 00:44:49,769
using Hedra you know have like how you

1213
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:52,410
would manage the projects and importing

1214
00:44:49,769 --> 00:44:54,720
and disassembling so that's in the

1215
00:44:52,410 --> 00:44:56,220
intermediate and beginning classes we

1216
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:57,569
also have an advanced development class

1217
00:44:56,220 --> 00:45:00,000
which is which shows you how to write

1218
00:44:57,569 --> 00:45:01,710
plug-ins analyzer scripts all sorts of

1219
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:03,750
things that to to customize the

1220
00:45:01,710 --> 00:45:06,529
framework there's also some

1221
00:45:03,750 --> 00:45:08,819
documentation on writing slate languages

1222
00:45:06,529 --> 00:45:11,490
inside of the and that's underneath of

1223
00:45:08,819 --> 00:45:12,990
our distribution under Ghidorah Docs

1224
00:45:11,490 --> 00:45:17,008
Kizer class there's a whole bunch of

1225
00:45:12,990 --> 00:45:19,410
classes there and of course if you're if

1226
00:45:17,009 --> 00:45:22,019
you're a developer you know just look at

1227
00:45:19,410 --> 00:45:24,180
our code there's lots of examples in the

1228
00:45:22,019 --> 00:45:25,319
script manager all of the scripts there

1229
00:45:24,180 --> 00:45:27,480
like most of the scripts that are

1230
00:45:25,319 --> 00:45:28,799
included there are very useful but

1231
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:31,019
they're also there deliberately as

1232
00:45:28,799 --> 00:45:32,279
examples for how to do things like how

1233
00:45:31,019 --> 00:45:33,689
would you get irate over functions in

1234
00:45:32,279 --> 00:45:35,430
the listing how would you lay down

1235
00:45:33,690 --> 00:45:36,930
functions in the listing things like

1236
00:45:35,430 --> 00:45:40,288
that's a lot of the scripts there are a

1237
00:45:36,930 --> 00:45:41,180
great resource to go to find find out

1238
00:45:40,289 --> 00:45:46,049
how to do things

1239
00:45:41,180 --> 00:45:49,319
thank you sure thank you I have one

1240
00:45:46,049 --> 00:45:52,079
question now with all the positive

1241
00:45:49,319 --> 00:46:03,240
feedback of open sourcing Yuja do you

1242
00:45:52,079 --> 00:46:06,180
plan to open source and attitude sure

1243
00:46:03,240 --> 00:46:08,549
like we there's nothing just like there

1244
00:46:06,180 --> 00:46:09,839
specifically plan but we're but NSA in

1245
00:46:08,549 --> 00:46:14,390
general is hoping to engage more with

1246
00:46:09,839 --> 00:46:14,390
open source absolutely going forward yes

1247
00:46:18,980 --> 00:46:24,720
about this being declassified now does

1248
00:46:22,650 --> 00:46:27,329
that mean like all the changes that are

1249
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:28,620
submitted in pull requests and so on you

1250
00:46:27,329 --> 00:46:31,170
can just work on or do

1251
00:46:28,620 --> 00:46:33,060
you still have a lengthy process where

1252
00:46:31,170 --> 00:46:34,860
it's being approved that you can do

1253
00:46:33,060 --> 00:46:38,160
something there and I just wonder how

1254
00:46:34,860 --> 00:46:52,590
quick this will run could you translate

1255
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:54,600
again I could hear so yeah so like we've

1256
00:46:52,590 --> 00:46:56,130
if you go if we take a look at the you

1257
00:46:54,600 --> 00:47:00,569
know at the pool were at the metric

1258
00:46:56,130 --> 00:47:02,790
slide so like we've we've gotten as of

1259
00:47:00,570 --> 00:47:05,060
the 22nd job you said we had 140 pool

1260
00:47:02,790 --> 00:47:07,650
requests we still had about 30 open

1261
00:47:05,060 --> 00:47:09,360
where we're bringing them in as fast as

1262
00:47:07,650 --> 00:47:10,980
we can and like we're still trying to

1263
00:47:09,360 --> 00:47:13,140
also kind of figure out how we're gonna

1264
00:47:10,980 --> 00:47:14,700
work in this new environment so some

1265
00:47:13,140 --> 00:47:16,290
like some of them if they're small on

1266
00:47:14,700 --> 00:47:17,790
there and they're and they're easy to

1267
00:47:16,290 --> 00:47:18,870
understand what the what the changes

1268
00:47:17,790 --> 00:47:21,210
they may go in quicker

1269
00:47:18,870 --> 00:47:25,009
some of them may take longer or you know

1270
00:47:21,210 --> 00:47:25,010
still trying to try to figure that out

1271
00:47:30,680 --> 00:47:34,359
thank you so much for joining our

1272
00:47:32,850 --> 00:47:37,549
session thank you everybody

1273
00:47:34,360 --> 00:47:37,550
