1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,659
my name is dr. John Griffin it is my

2
00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:06,119
great pleasure to introduce our speakers

3
00:00:03,659 --> 00:00:09,080
olivier boludo the director of research

4
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:11,849
at gos secure and Masada Peck whit

5
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:14,370
Cousteau I'm so sorry about that

6
00:00:11,849 --> 00:00:16,980
Thurston who is a security researcher

7
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:19,259
also at gos secure they are also

8
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:22,830
organizers for the next North SEC

9
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:25,560
conference and I don't see the clock

10
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:27,959
going yet but let's go all right perfect

11
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:31,679
we have so much content let's just keep

12
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:35,160
on going so hi I'm Misaka pocket Houston

13
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:36,420
indeed and that's a little ado today

14
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:39,779
we're gonna talk about social media

15
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:41,640
manipulation driven by malware so let's

16
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:45,809
start right away into the topic so back

17
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:48,500
in 2015 and 2016 we were studying sorry

18
00:00:45,809 --> 00:00:51,149
Olivia was working at ESET with a fellow

19
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:52,800
Tom a degree a fellow worker and they

20
00:00:51,149 --> 00:00:54,329
were both studying in Linux moves which

21
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:57,120
was known to be an IOT but net

22
00:00:54,329 --> 00:00:59,219
conducting social media fraud at that

23
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:01,500
time they were studying version 1 and

24
00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:04,110
then LED switch job and started to work

25
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:06,810
at go secure and ISA luckily shared to

26
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:09,420
us the second version of the malware and

27
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:11,189
at that time I was still an intern at Co

28
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:13,770
secure and we had that great idea of

29
00:01:11,189 --> 00:01:15,839
partnering up all together me my

30
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:18,179
professor at that time david lee ji-su

31
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:20,009
from university of montreal and my taxi

32
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:22,770
research nonprofit research organization

33
00:01:20,009 --> 00:01:26,460
in Canada to actually study this second

34
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:28,320
version of Linux moves so at first you

35
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:30,449
must be wondering why we say Linux moves

36
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:32,520
because we're gonna talk all around like

37
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:35,670
all around the clock about this specific

38
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:37,350
coyote but Annette well Linux moose this

39
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:39,900
is because when Ellijay studied the

40
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:42,329
malware in 2015 they found in the

41
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:44,850
binaries the word Allah and were French

42
00:01:42,329 --> 00:01:47,669
Canadians and Allah and French means

43
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:49,589
moose in English and for that purpose I

44
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:50,939
decided to call it Linux because it's

45
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:52,770
actually targeting embedded Linux

46
00:01:50,939 --> 00:01:54,179
systems and moves to give it a Canadian

47
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:58,079
touch although they probably aren't

48
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:59,909
chameleon at all olynyk's moose is an

49
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:02,429
IOT but not as I said that conducts

50
00:01:59,909 --> 00:02:04,140
social media frog what is social media

51
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:06,329
furred well it's the process of creating

52
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:08,520
fake likes and creating fake accounts to

53
00:02:06,329 --> 00:02:10,079
go online and then creating fake likes

54
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:13,860
and follows on social networks like

55
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:16,830
Instagram Facebook or Twitter very good

56
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:19,830
full of social media manipulation that

57
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:22,620
we can give is a journalist in Quebec so

58
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:23,850
she decided to become an influencer by

59
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:26,280
cheating and that was for an

60
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:29,880
investigation not for her own purpose so

61
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:31,770
which it is in December 2018 is that she

62
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:33,630
created that fake profile called the

63
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:35,340
pretty runner and started posting

64
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:37,410
pictures of her like running and all

65
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:38,820
that and then she we met with her and

66
00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:41,760
she told us the different methods that

67
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:43,620
she used to increase her visibility so

68
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:45,989
she used follow unfollow methods like

69
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:47,670
for like shells so like sherilee entered

70
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:49,050
into groups called pods where

71
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:50,609
influencers like post pictures of

72
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:52,530
themselves and then liked each other to

73
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:54,180
give themselves more visibility and she

74
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:56,459
told us that she firstly bought fake

75
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:58,070
likes fake followers so that fake

76
00:02:56,459 --> 00:03:00,480
followers gave us that sort of

77
00:02:58,070 --> 00:03:01,769
first-round base of visibility and then

78
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:04,980
afterwards she worked with different

79
00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:07,950
methods today what we're gonna do is

80
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:09,720
focus on this last process of buying

81
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:12,089
fake followers we're gonna focus on the

82
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:15,320
supply side so who is actually selling

83
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:17,400
and who are the actors so basically

84
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:19,380
today's presentation is about the

85
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:21,840
ecosystem of social media manipulation

86
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:24,329
this presentation is about a four year

87
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:26,580
long investigation that started in 2015

88
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:28,800
in which we use various investigative

89
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:31,320
techniques so including traffic analysis

90
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:32,820
reverse engineering investigating forums

91
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:35,340
and trying to understand what's going on

92
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:37,410
among the actors and we sort of had that

93
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:39,510
sort of big conclusion of being able to

94
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:41,760
map all the actors involved that are

95
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:44,030
related to the IOT botnet and sort of

96
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:46,620
understand where the money was flowing

97
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:48,360
so from this presentation I hope you

98
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:50,130
sort of start seeing differently social

99
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:53,030
networks and how we can actually create

100
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:56,489
social media manipulation so let's start

101
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:58,290
yep so first off let's recap what the

102
00:03:56,489 --> 00:04:00,989
Linux ghost is all about so Linux most

103
00:03:58,290 --> 00:04:03,000
in our ecosystem fits its weighted feets

104
00:04:00,989 --> 00:04:06,000
right on the ground so a base layer of

105
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:08,880
this economy and it's the only thing

106
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:11,040
that is doing some real illegal activity

107
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:12,570
criminal activity the rest is all terms

108
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:14,940
of services breach and stuff like that

109
00:04:12,570 --> 00:04:16,858
sorry we'll cover that later

110
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:18,719
in a nutshell Linux most affects router

111
00:04:16,858 --> 00:04:20,969
and Internet of Things but we like to

112
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:23,100
precise that you know avoid the high

113
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:25,169
we're talking here about Linux embedded

114
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:26,570
systems with a busybox user land if

115
00:04:25,169 --> 00:04:28,700
these requirements are not met

116
00:04:26,570 --> 00:04:30,500
Linux mousse will not infect it has a

117
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:32,510
worm like behavior so it would spread

118
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:34,280
itself by using telnet credential

119
00:04:32,510 --> 00:04:36,230
brute-forcing and its main pillow

120
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:38,059
there's a proxy service which supports

121
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:41,330
several protocols and when we studied

122
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:45,380
that proxy it was solely used to proxy

123
00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:47,870
social media traffic we deployed the

124
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:49,880
honeypot we'll be able to catch it and

125
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:51,770
detonate it and be able to track the

126
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:53,659
activity I'm not going to delve into the

127
00:04:51,770 --> 00:04:55,150
details if you want the full details you

128
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:58,100
should look at our previous

129
00:04:55,150 --> 00:04:59,659
presentations and paper on the topic we

130
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:01,460
deployed these on efforts worldwide so

131
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:03,560
we have a very large footprint and we

132
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:06,890
studied and track traffic for a long

133
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:08,210
time and we performed an HTTP

134
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:10,909
man-in-the-middle attack where we

135
00:05:08,210 --> 00:05:13,039
weakened the the we had access to the

136
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:14,600
raw traffic and this is a short

137
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:16,340
description of how we performed it we

138
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:19,280
can get into details and we have other

139
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:21,679
papers that dive into the details but in

140
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:25,010
a nutshell what happen is we got access

141
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:26,420
to the raw traffic but then what can we

142
00:05:25,010 --> 00:05:30,580
do with the traffic massara

143
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:34,580
yes so at that time where did we stand

144
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:36,859
well we had several in fact several

145
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:39,650
infected hosts use actively by operators

146
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:40,820
we also had HTTP traffic in plain text

147
00:05:39,650 --> 00:05:43,760
just because of the man-in-the-middle

148
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:45,290
attack we had cnc traffic and publicly

149
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:46,820
available seller markets so I mean

150
00:05:45,290 --> 00:05:49,970
anything online which we could actually

151
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:52,610
help our investigation and this is when

152
00:05:49,970 --> 00:05:54,950
we presented at blackhat Europe in 2016

153
00:05:52,610 --> 00:05:56,090
before not going into the details it's

154
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:57,920
because everything is actually

155
00:05:56,090 --> 00:06:00,099
documented in two papers that we

156
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:02,600
published and in obsession that we did

157
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:04,220
there what one thing after that

158
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:06,560
presentation that we didn't talk about

159
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:09,890
that sort of yielded this research is

160
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:12,080
the concept of whitelisted IPS that was

161
00:06:09,890 --> 00:06:14,030
within the infrastructure of linux news

162
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:16,430
so i'm gonna try to be really clear

163
00:06:14,030 --> 00:06:18,140
because you have to focus here so

164
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:20,630
whitelisted ip's were actually just

165
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:23,330
servers that had the right to use the

166
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:26,810
networks that infected devices so they

167
00:06:23,330 --> 00:06:29,840
were found in the beacon messages and

168
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:31,310
since they had the right to use the but

169
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:33,020
map they were the only one being able to

170
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:36,500
send requests through the network of

171
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:39,229
infected devices we saw potentially this

172
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:39,799
could be a reseller model why because

173
00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:41,239
well

174
00:06:39,799 --> 00:06:43,188
you could have whitelisted eyepieces

175
00:06:41,239 --> 00:06:44,989
it's simply servers right where somebody

176
00:06:43,189 --> 00:06:47,119
just logs in and then sells Twitter

177
00:06:44,989 --> 00:06:49,279
followers go on that server and then

178
00:06:47,119 --> 00:06:50,899
since you know like the order through

179
00:06:49,279 --> 00:06:54,349
the botnet so it's actually completed

180
00:06:50,899 --> 00:06:56,719
right so that was our main idea so we

181
00:06:54,349 --> 00:06:58,998
thought and we we wondered how we could

182
00:06:56,719 --> 00:07:01,549
sort of confirm or refute that

183
00:06:58,999 --> 00:07:03,709
hypotheses what we did is traffic

184
00:07:01,549 --> 00:07:05,899
analysis so we correlated the pcaps

185
00:07:03,709 --> 00:07:07,519
traffic that we had with the MTM proxy

186
00:07:05,899 --> 00:07:08,749
log it took us a while to actually be

187
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:11,599
able to correlate everything together

188
00:07:08,749 --> 00:07:13,549
then we use jupiter lab a very cool tool

189
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:15,199
that exists where you can actually do

190
00:07:13,549 --> 00:07:16,789
that' frames and then easily drop

191
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:18,919
everything using clustering heuristics

192
00:07:16,789 --> 00:07:20,539
and data science and then we develop

193
00:07:18,919 --> 00:07:22,128
different variables we thought could

194
00:07:20,539 --> 00:07:23,659
indicate us whether or not the

195
00:07:22,129 --> 00:07:25,729
whitelisted IPS would represent every

196
00:07:23,659 --> 00:07:27,919
cellular model so for example honey

197
00:07:25,729 --> 00:07:30,619
butts use website targeted Els

198
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:32,269
fingerprints user agents all these

199
00:07:30,619 --> 00:07:35,119
variables didn't yield much result I

200
00:07:32,269 --> 00:07:37,519
spent a lot of time analyzing except

201
00:07:35,119 --> 00:07:39,469
from two so two variables accounts

202
00:07:37,519 --> 00:07:41,599
created on social networks and accounts

203
00:07:39,469 --> 00:07:43,248
followed on social networks actually

204
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:46,610
yielded the response

205
00:07:43,249 --> 00:07:47,629
so basically whitelisted ip's were meant

206
00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:50,689
for a list account

207
00:07:47,629 --> 00:07:52,879
oh sorry fake fake account management so

208
00:07:50,689 --> 00:07:55,489
each whitelisted IP was related to a

209
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:57,349
fake account that was to it like linked

210
00:07:55,489 --> 00:07:58,998
only to that whitelisted IP but they

211
00:07:57,349 --> 00:08:01,369
were all following the same accounts

212
00:07:58,999 --> 00:08:03,289
potential buyers we call so we couldn't

213
00:08:01,369 --> 00:08:04,699
say oh this is a reseller model because

214
00:08:03,289 --> 00:08:06,829
they were all following the same

215
00:08:04,699 --> 00:08:08,719
accounts so there was most likely one

216
00:08:06,829 --> 00:08:10,429
organization but since they were

217
00:08:08,719 --> 00:08:11,689
managing fake accounts we could conclude

218
00:08:10,429 --> 00:08:13,698
that this is most likely what they're

219
00:08:11,689 --> 00:08:15,349
doing and it makes sense it's hard to

220
00:08:13,699 --> 00:08:17,509
manage fake account on Instagram or

221
00:08:15,349 --> 00:08:19,159
Twitter if you have a hundred thousands

222
00:08:17,509 --> 00:08:21,349
of them right has to go through the same

223
00:08:19,159 --> 00:08:26,239
honeypot so it's the same ip and it has

224
00:08:21,349 --> 00:08:29,359
to look legitimate to where did we stand

225
00:08:26,239 --> 00:08:31,248
at that time each whitelisted IP

226
00:08:29,359 --> 00:08:33,620
addresses had their own list of fake

227
00:08:31,249 --> 00:08:35,389
accounts and additionally through our

228
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:37,669
investigation we found out that each of

229
00:08:35,389 --> 00:08:39,799
these white listed IPS were hosted on

230
00:08:37,669 --> 00:08:42,049
Windows servers and talking to somebody

231
00:08:39,799 --> 00:08:43,549
at ovh state like that person told us

232
00:08:42,049 --> 00:08:45,920
that Remote Desktop Protocol was

233
00:08:43,549 --> 00:08:47,870
actively used so RDP was actively used

234
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:49,550
what kind of piece of infrastructure

235
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:51,259
could sort of glue all of this together

236
00:08:49,550 --> 00:08:52,500
Windows servers where somebody can just

237
00:08:51,259 --> 00:08:54,270
remotely connect to the

238
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:57,660
and then manage this to fake accounts to

239
00:08:54,270 --> 00:08:59,100
produce fake likes and follows so this

240
00:08:57,660 --> 00:09:02,030
is where we enter the automation

241
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:05,340
software part of a chapter of that story

242
00:09:02,030 --> 00:09:08,010
automation software is basically a thick

243
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:10,110
client that runs on Windows that will

244
00:09:08,010 --> 00:09:12,060
offer you a grid layout where you manage

245
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:15,390
thousands of fake accounts on Instagram

246
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:17,849
and you order them to do stuff and what

247
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:19,710
we found is we found an ecosystem of

248
00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:21,930
such software provided by various

249
00:09:19,710 --> 00:09:24,270
different vendors so we place that actor

250
00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:26,670
here right besides the moose because it

251
00:09:24,270 --> 00:09:29,490
tracks with it so you see our little

252
00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:32,430
ecosystem building up here automation

253
00:09:29,490 --> 00:09:34,680
software what we tried to do with it is

254
00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:37,140
we try to find the one that Linux moose

255
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:37,979
uses and so we based this research on

256
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:39,540
user agent

257
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:42,090
we knew that both mobile and desktop

258
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:44,010
user agent or under use and it needed

259
00:09:42,090 --> 00:09:46,080
sucks proxy support because this is all

260
00:09:44,010 --> 00:09:49,710
what we saw in the Linux moose traffic

261
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:52,350
we found different sets of feature from

262
00:09:49,710 --> 00:09:54,210
different vendors I'm listing them here

263
00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:55,500
but it's like you know user agent custom

264
00:09:54,210 --> 00:09:57,780
browsing patter and different types of

265
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:59,400
proxy different scales of account

266
00:09:57,780 --> 00:10:01,199
management and we found different

267
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:03,120
business models so some offer them an

268
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:05,250
unlimited account support for Instagram

269
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:08,070
and other social network some were

270
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:09,840
one-time fee payment methods some more

271
00:10:08,070 --> 00:10:12,450
pay per month some more paper account

272
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:13,710
per you know bulk like 100 of accounts

273
00:10:12,450 --> 00:10:15,180
is a different price than the thousand

274
00:10:13,710 --> 00:10:17,850
of accounts so we're gonna go through

275
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:20,069
here a list of the one we studied and

276
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:21,390
then we will conclude with a table

277
00:10:20,070 --> 00:10:23,640
summarizing all the result which

278
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:25,680
unfortunately I'll have to go quickly

279
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:28,230
over but you will have the slides if you

280
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:30,810
need the information so Graham Dominator

281
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:32,940
is one of the first one we found and the

282
00:10:30,810 --> 00:10:35,250
Dominator suite they have for all social

283
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:36,900
networks so they sell verticals afford

284
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:39,120
specific social network and they have a

285
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:41,370
social Dominator which covers them all

286
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:43,410
which is more expensive here you can see

287
00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:45,300
that it fits what we needed it has proxy

288
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:48,000
support and it runs several Instagram

289
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:49,770
account at the same time when we started

290
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,570
reverse engineering it we realized that

291
00:10:49,770 --> 00:10:53,730
they they were not using a static list

292
00:10:51,570 --> 00:10:56,250
of user agent they were using a device

293
00:10:53,730 --> 00:10:57,720
generator and when looking at the device

294
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:59,550
generator we found that they were really

295
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:02,520
tokenizing the user agent strings

296
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:04,920
exactly like Instagram does it when it

297
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:08,100
configures its HTTP client inside

298
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:10,829
the application and so we stimulated

299
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:13,619
using PowerShell that library and we got

300
00:11:10,829 --> 00:11:15,299
different user agent strings and you see

301
00:11:13,619 --> 00:11:17,699
that it's pretty convincing and very

302
00:11:15,299 --> 00:11:21,119
similarly looking to actual phones you

303
00:11:17,699 --> 00:11:23,758
would see in a while in the wild next

304
00:11:21,119 --> 00:11:25,410
social Dominator so this is the big view

305
00:11:23,759 --> 00:11:27,959
you know it's very small but if i zoom

306
00:11:25,410 --> 00:11:30,329
in you see where the grid layout stands

307
00:11:27,959 --> 00:11:32,459
up so I we only have one account in

308
00:11:30,329 --> 00:11:34,199
there but if you have more have more

309
00:11:32,459 --> 00:11:37,138
account you would see like one below

310
00:11:34,199 --> 00:11:39,179
each other you you also see in that

311
00:11:37,139 --> 00:11:41,009
screen shot that you have a proxy

312
00:11:39,179 --> 00:11:42,959
address per user account so user

313
00:11:41,009 --> 00:11:44,999
accounts will be pinned to a specific

314
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:46,919
proxy which means that it will look like

315
00:11:44,999 --> 00:11:48,239
a human it will always use the same IP

316
00:11:46,919 --> 00:11:51,419
right it will come from the same

317
00:11:48,239 --> 00:11:53,970
residential IP you can you know import

318
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:57,449
and both different information and you

319
00:11:53,970 --> 00:11:59,309
have a log of the if stuff that is doing

320
00:11:57,449 --> 00:12:01,649
is successful or not so this is social

321
00:11:59,309 --> 00:12:02,759
Dominator then we studied follow like or

322
00:12:01,649 --> 00:12:04,949
follow like err we have a little

323
00:12:02,759 --> 00:12:07,559
anecdote little story with it so when I

324
00:12:04,949 --> 00:12:10,410
first tried to run it without using the

325
00:12:07,559 --> 00:12:12,719
launcher.exe I got an error saying like

326
00:12:10,410 --> 00:12:14,910
the Java Runtime is not a bit eligible

327
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:16,980
for distribution and so I looked at this

328
00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:20,819
at the binary I figured that they were

329
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:23,639
using a packer called Jeb which it

330
00:12:20,819 --> 00:12:25,378
compiles Java into what looks like a mix

331
00:12:23,639 --> 00:12:27,899
of syphilis to us and native code and

332
00:12:25,379 --> 00:12:30,089
have its own shit inside of it so it's

333
00:12:27,899 --> 00:12:32,579
like two hundred and sixty seven Meg of

334
00:12:30,089 --> 00:12:34,529
native code so we were really it was

335
00:12:32,579 --> 00:12:37,109
really daunting right and so they were

336
00:12:34,529 --> 00:12:39,329
using an expired version of Jeb which we

337
00:12:37,110 --> 00:12:41,790
found because in the strings in one of

338
00:12:39,329 --> 00:12:44,279
the the main binary you saw that they

339
00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:45,540
were linking to an evaluation version so

340
00:12:44,279 --> 00:12:48,480
how did they worked around that

341
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:50,969
evaluation version well they in the

342
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:54,149
launcher they embedded a upx

343
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:56,399
pact version of run a state which they

344
00:12:54,149 --> 00:12:58,110
would launch to fake the date on the

345
00:12:56,399 --> 00:13:00,449
system so that the evaluation version

346
00:12:58,110 --> 00:13:02,459
would run so it's pretty fancy and

347
00:13:00,449 --> 00:13:05,039
sophisticated just to have a really well

348
00:13:02,459 --> 00:13:07,529
packed but for free version of that

349
00:13:05,039 --> 00:13:09,299
software all of this to get a software

350
00:13:07,529 --> 00:13:11,249
that looks like this which is pretty

351
00:13:09,299 --> 00:13:14,949
standard like the others but it was a

352
00:13:11,249 --> 00:13:17,590
very well you know the

353
00:13:14,950 --> 00:13:20,920
and we analyzed all of them and we

354
00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:23,170
didn't find the the software that Linux

355
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:26,079
mousse was using there were always a

356
00:13:23,170 --> 00:13:29,290
little thing that didn't work and so we

357
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:31,720
will need to move on to study more

358
00:13:29,290 --> 00:13:34,240
automation software in the future but

359
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:36,460
now where do we stand

360
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:39,040
we've found several automation software

361
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:41,470
vendors and we know that the reseller

362
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:43,180
model is not at the button at level so

363
00:13:41,470 --> 00:13:43,750
massara please introduce us what you

364
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:47,349
found

365
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:49,780
yes so let's go back to the HTTP traffic

366
00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:52,540
that we had that was actually decrypted

367
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:54,880
while I was investigating that traffic I

368
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:56,349
was I wanted to find some sort of an

369
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:57,820
account that could be related to the

370
00:13:56,350 --> 00:13:59,770
selling of fake likes and follows that

371
00:13:57,820 --> 00:14:01,930
would allow me to say oh yes this

372
00:13:59,770 --> 00:14:03,370
account on Instagram is related to a

373
00:14:01,930 --> 00:14:05,109
business that sells fake likes and

374
00:14:03,370 --> 00:14:07,030
follows and thus I could say Linux moves

375
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:10,060
like it just link it right away together

376
00:14:07,030 --> 00:14:12,670
right what happened is instead I ended

377
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:14,829
up finding bulk reseller panels like

378
00:14:12,670 --> 00:14:18,310
media Nizza panel at the time which is

379
00:14:14,830 --> 00:14:20,230
now shut down so bulk reseller panels I

380
00:14:18,310 --> 00:14:21,910
simply panels that are actually selling

381
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:23,650
fake likes and follows in bulk the

382
00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:25,689
journalist I talked about earlier she

383
00:14:23,650 --> 00:14:27,040
was really mad when she heard about this

384
00:14:25,690 --> 00:14:28,630
because she paid a very high price for

385
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:30,160
the followers where I should have gone

386
00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:33,730
on these reseller panels and pay them

387
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:35,439
for a cheaper price where they wear the

388
00:14:33,730 --> 00:14:37,720
sari see reseller panels stand in our

389
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:40,780
ecosystem well we decided to represent

390
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:43,690
them as spiders and webs wonder why and

391
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:45,550
just a little bit above the automation

392
00:14:43,690 --> 00:14:48,130
software and the Linux Linux moves

393
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:50,890
providers so they simply looked like

394
00:14:48,130 --> 00:14:52,630
that they're actually just like you can

395
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:54,730
easily create an account with a fake

396
00:14:52,630 --> 00:14:57,340
email with password and they offer all

397
00:14:54,730 --> 00:15:00,370
sorts of services on all social media so

398
00:14:57,340 --> 00:15:02,080
Twitter Instagram Facebook what's

399
00:15:00,370 --> 00:15:04,120
interesting is that the prices are

400
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:06,220
really cheap and it differs among the

401
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:08,440
reseller panels but the cheaper you go

402
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:11,080
into the prices and the more shady the

403
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:12,700
payment processes are so like I wanted a

404
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:14,560
buy a million followers for very cheap

405
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:19,030
and I could only pay in Bitcoin

406
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:20,469
she said what I mean and what was

407
00:15:19,030 --> 00:15:22,150
interesting about this reseller panel

408
00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:24,010
when we were studying them is that yes

409
00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:26,439
they sold popularity in bulk but they

410
00:15:24,010 --> 00:15:27,160
also all looked alike so while I

411
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:29,200
investigated

412
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:31,180
one two or three of them I was like they

413
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:32,650
all look alike they all probably the

414
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:35,260
same organization or the same people

415
00:15:32,650 --> 00:15:37,740
behind so with it a simple investigation

416
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:40,569
back then so we gathered information on

417
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:42,400
343 reseller panels and gathered

418
00:15:40,570 --> 00:15:44,350
information on fingerprint of the web

419
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:46,390
application the main registration

420
00:15:44,350 --> 00:15:48,940
information HTML content and IP

421
00:15:46,390 --> 00:15:50,890
addresses very simple investigation we

422
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:53,470
clustered things together and although

423
00:15:50,890 --> 00:15:55,210
like we did yield some results there was

424
00:15:53,470 --> 00:15:57,100
just one main result that I couldn't

425
00:15:55,210 --> 00:16:00,520
actually not look at and it was the IP

426
00:15:57,100 --> 00:16:03,700
address so 66% of our sample was being

427
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:06,460
hosted on the same IP so by just doing a

428
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:08,350
simple back capacitive DNS query I ended

429
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:10,660
up finding that that this IP was

430
00:16:08,350 --> 00:16:12,970
actually hosting over a thousand other

431
00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:15,040
websites other domains and all these

432
00:16:12,970 --> 00:16:17,560
domains were related to the resell of

433
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:19,540
fake likes and bulk so you can see here

434
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:21,189
that you have panels called gramm panel

435
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:23,050
at followers comm and they're all

436
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:24,960
related to bulk reselling of fake likes

437
00:16:23,050 --> 00:16:27,010
and follows and while investigators

438
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:29,920
investigating that we found perfect

439
00:16:27,010 --> 00:16:32,920
panel comm which is like the actor that

440
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:35,110
sort of explains that tent that trend so

441
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:38,290
perfect panel is a new actor in the

442
00:16:35,110 --> 00:16:40,810
ecosystem called panel as a service so

443
00:16:38,290 --> 00:16:43,150
what they do is they help you by giving

444
00:16:40,810 --> 00:16:44,949
you a platform if you wanted to be into

445
00:16:43,150 --> 00:16:46,840
the bo3 selling of fake likes and

446
00:16:44,950 --> 00:16:50,500
follows without having the technical

447
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:53,110
knowledge for it right so that new actor

448
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:55,150
is represented as a wolf behind the

449
00:16:53,110 --> 00:16:58,570
spiders because it enables the reseller

450
00:16:55,150 --> 00:17:01,990
panels to exist right and it's right

451
00:16:58,570 --> 00:17:04,329
here in the ecosystem so panel has a

452
00:17:01,990 --> 00:17:05,949
service we found about five of them some

453
00:17:04,329 --> 00:17:07,869
of them had like had alder domains

454
00:17:05,949 --> 00:17:10,089
hosted on the same ip's others don't

455
00:17:07,869 --> 00:17:11,919
didn't and what they offered was they're

456
00:17:10,089 --> 00:17:14,230
ready to go software providing web

457
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:16,569
hosting and some sometimes even domain

458
00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:18,459
name and even gave features where you

459
00:17:16,569 --> 00:17:20,619
could actually have api's to receive

460
00:17:18,459 --> 00:17:22,449
orders and api's to send orders so you

461
00:17:20,619 --> 00:17:23,919
could actually just use two api acting

462
00:17:22,449 --> 00:17:26,170
the middleman and just try to sell in

463
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:27,760
bulk and if you were more of a manual

464
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:29,200
person and you wanted to track your

465
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:30,760
workers in the sweatshop that was

466
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:33,850
possible to so you could actually see

467
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:35,200
workers working saying i create a new

468
00:17:33,850 --> 00:17:38,500
fake account here is the

469
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:39,880
password username and all that here I

470
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:41,500
give you just a screen shot of an

471
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:42,880
example of a panel it's not perfect

472
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:44,169
panel it's in this rabbit

473
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:47,139
so they actually gives you a possibility

474
00:17:44,169 --> 00:17:47,590
to do go on the demo and they see how it

475
00:17:47,139 --> 00:17:50,649
works

476
00:17:47,590 --> 00:17:52,928
so you see that this panel all the users

477
00:17:50,649 --> 00:17:54,908
and then what are their funds and when

478
00:17:52,929 --> 00:17:56,110
did was the last time they ordered above

479
00:17:54,909 --> 00:17:59,529
you can see that you can like click on

480
00:17:56,110 --> 00:18:01,510
the orders the load history and all that

481
00:17:59,529 --> 00:18:04,210
and even if you go and look at the API

482
00:18:01,510 --> 00:18:06,279
option if they even give you options to

483
00:18:04,210 --> 00:18:07,750
connect to API is directly so if you

484
00:18:06,279 --> 00:18:09,070
would have to be linked to Linux most

485
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:10,510
you would only have to connect to

486
00:18:09,070 --> 00:18:12,519
another reseller panel is cheaper and

487
00:18:10,510 --> 00:18:16,269
then act in the middle right and then

488
00:18:12,519 --> 00:18:19,750
you see here you have SM M papa and then

489
00:18:16,269 --> 00:18:21,399
SM and lights cheap and all that well

490
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:23,200
investigating we were wondering how

491
00:18:21,399 --> 00:18:25,689
reseller panels were actually connected

492
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:28,149
to Linux moose so how these two are

493
00:18:25,690 --> 00:18:30,309
linked so with what we did is we went on

494
00:18:28,149 --> 00:18:31,719
blackhat world and studied like try to

495
00:18:30,309 --> 00:18:33,519
find conversation about the main

496
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:35,649
providers and we did we found reseller

497
00:18:33,519 --> 00:18:38,350
panel owners discussing here I give you

498
00:18:35,649 --> 00:18:40,000
an example of one saying mostly L panels

499
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:42,519
use the same provider the only

500
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:44,380
difference is price if anyone knows this

501
00:18:42,519 --> 00:18:46,450
provider which could be Linux moose or

502
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:48,940
any others he is welcome to contact me

503
00:18:46,450 --> 00:18:49,809
privately and then you see that even

504
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:51,929
though they're looking for the main

505
00:18:49,809 --> 00:18:54,340
provider the main provider is shield

506
00:18:51,929 --> 00:18:56,139
some it's just an example here of

507
00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:57,879
somebody saying no one will reveal the

508
00:18:56,139 --> 00:19:00,549
main provider for them it's their hidden

509
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:02,230
ghost and here I give you a very good

510
00:19:00,549 --> 00:19:04,450
it's a little bit outdated because it

511
00:19:02,230 --> 00:19:06,850
was in 2017 but it's it sort of stays

512
00:19:04,450 --> 00:19:08,409
there the fact really well the person

513
00:19:06,850 --> 00:19:10,090
says guys unless you're spending a

514
00:19:08,409 --> 00:19:11,559
thousand dollars on s mmm panels you

515
00:19:10,090 --> 00:19:13,330
don't need to search for the original so

516
00:19:11,559 --> 00:19:15,309
fire he wouldn't be interested in your

517
00:19:13,330 --> 00:19:16,928
volumes and you need just need to find

518
00:19:15,309 --> 00:19:19,539
the most reliable reseller for the most

519
00:19:16,929 --> 00:19:21,220
cheapest resellers in this market you

520
00:19:19,539 --> 00:19:24,549
have to put your efforts not in buying

521
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:26,139
cheap but in selling more however when

522
00:19:24,549 --> 00:19:27,668
you think about it it can't only be

523
00:19:26,139 --> 00:19:29,260
Linux Moos right the haast via the

524
00:19:27,669 --> 00:19:30,940
providers other methods because like

525
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:32,950
unix moose can only actually provide for

526
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:34,510
this whole ecosystem and then we found

527
00:19:32,950 --> 00:19:35,950
other people discussing of the fact that

528
00:19:34,510 --> 00:19:37,389
there was not only one provider and

529
00:19:35,950 --> 00:19:39,220
there was several and several methods

530
00:19:37,389 --> 00:19:41,709
were possible and that made us thought

531
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:46,379
what kind of other methods could be used

532
00:19:41,710 --> 00:19:48,070
while using the automation software and

533
00:19:46,379 --> 00:19:50,978
that so

534
00:19:48,070 --> 00:19:53,289
where do we stand here we have a system

535
00:19:50,979 --> 00:19:55,809
resellers and panel as a service

536
00:19:53,289 --> 00:19:58,119
provider we have automation software to

537
00:19:55,809 --> 00:20:00,279
create an orchestrate fake accounts

538
00:19:58,119 --> 00:20:03,100
what's the next hurdle for the bad guys

539
00:20:00,279 --> 00:20:06,340
doing in this market well it's being

540
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:08,738
blocked because your trucks seeing all

541
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:10,600
your traffic to just a few sets of IPs

542
00:20:08,739 --> 00:20:13,809
and these IPS are flagged

543
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:15,699
IP reputation is is very important for

544
00:20:13,809 --> 00:20:18,340
social networks because it allows them

545
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:22,269
to really filter you know and block

546
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:26,590
various accounts so what what is fun to

547
00:20:22,269 --> 00:20:29,440
work around that that hurdle is using

548
00:20:26,590 --> 00:20:31,359
high quality proxies and this is when we

549
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:33,519
looking for an AI alternative to Linux

550
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:36,158
moves to provide such proxies found out

551
00:20:33,519 --> 00:20:38,259
about a logical system of residential

552
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:40,359
proxy providers when you think about it

553
00:20:38,259 --> 00:20:42,759
data center proxies are kind of easy to

554
00:20:40,359 --> 00:20:45,970
block easy to be to identify and who is

555
00:20:42,759 --> 00:20:48,999
and GIP databases and so you can block

556
00:20:45,970 --> 00:20:51,099
all some of data center IP addresses or

557
00:20:48,999 --> 00:20:53,320
even you know the whole block it after

558
00:20:51,099 --> 00:20:54,939
the whole thing you know but if you

559
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:56,559
think about residential proxies you

560
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:58,149
cannot block a whole subnet or a large

561
00:20:56,559 --> 00:21:00,849
portion of it if you're a social network

562
00:20:58,149 --> 00:21:02,408
operator because you will stop receiving

563
00:21:00,849 --> 00:21:04,210
that you know legitimate traffic it will

564
00:21:02,409 --> 00:21:05,679
piss off famous people and stuff like

565
00:21:04,210 --> 00:21:07,570
that so what they do is they need to

566
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:11,019
have a very individualized approach to

567
00:21:07,570 --> 00:21:14,918
blocking right so as we saw on blackhat

568
00:21:11,019 --> 00:21:17,440
world CEO by next-gen let's which is

569
00:21:14,919 --> 00:21:20,169
labeled a junior VIP he basically just

570
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:24,220
posted saying stop using data center

571
00:21:20,169 --> 00:21:26,169
proxies like very very mad right so what

572
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:30,070
we have here is a new actor enters the

573
00:21:26,169 --> 00:21:32,799
game which is an alternative to Linux

574
00:21:30,070 --> 00:21:34,418
Mo's which would be legal or not and

575
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:37,599
this is what we wanted to figure out is

576
00:21:34,419 --> 00:21:39,549
residential proxy services built on top

577
00:21:37,599 --> 00:21:43,059
of compromised infrastructure or is it

578
00:21:39,549 --> 00:21:44,918
really the least ISP landlines and they

579
00:21:43,059 --> 00:21:46,509
put servers in there and the proxy

580
00:21:44,919 --> 00:21:48,399
traffic through it so this is a new

581
00:21:46,509 --> 00:21:50,529
actor in our ecosystem which we've

582
00:21:48,399 --> 00:21:52,449
placed their foots on the ground but

583
00:21:50,529 --> 00:21:56,859
foot like you know baseman on the ground

584
00:21:52,450 --> 00:21:59,590
and side by side with Linux moose and so

585
00:21:56,859 --> 00:22:01,320
still automation software because of the

586
00:21:59,590 --> 00:22:03,810
proxy support features would can

587
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:06,870
to the residential proxy provider as an

588
00:22:03,810 --> 00:22:09,179
alternative to build a button we looked

589
00:22:06,870 --> 00:22:11,669
at hi proxy we looked at and we

590
00:22:09,180 --> 00:22:16,140
purchased residential proxies from hi

591
00:22:11,670 --> 00:22:18,390
proxy storm proxies are sucks valid

592
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:20,610
solution I want you to take a few second

593
00:22:18,390 --> 00:22:23,250
to appreciate the glorious webpage that

594
00:22:20,610 --> 00:22:25,800
they have the G ot reference which I

595
00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:27,780
don't get is I haven't seen G ot we

596
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:29,430
purchased and specifically from valid

597
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:31,980
solution has very different services and

598
00:22:29,430 --> 00:22:34,260
very cheap we purchased the comment us a

599
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:38,310
static proxies which are residential

600
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:41,670
ipv6 proxies $0.50 a piece for months

601
00:22:38,310 --> 00:22:43,350
and then we found about lumen Etsy let

602
00:22:41,670 --> 00:22:44,670
me not see is worth a few minutes of

603
00:22:43,350 --> 00:22:46,439
your attention because it is different

604
00:22:44,670 --> 00:22:48,630
than the others because it has a

605
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:49,410
business model and it says how its

606
00:22:48,630 --> 00:22:51,930
operate okay

607
00:22:49,410 --> 00:22:54,210
in its use case that are clearly stated

608
00:22:51,930 --> 00:22:56,220
really the highlight account management

609
00:22:54,210 --> 00:22:57,420
and it says manage social media account

610
00:22:56,220 --> 00:23:00,330
including Facebook Twitter Linkedin

611
00:22:57,420 --> 00:23:02,310
Craigslist eBay and more without getting

612
00:23:00,330 --> 00:23:05,129
banned or disabled so this is pretty

613
00:23:02,310 --> 00:23:07,590
clear what they are doing here and so I

614
00:23:05,130 --> 00:23:09,930
have a short video of their business

615
00:23:07,590 --> 00:23:15,750
model which they expose that I want to

community today this is completely crazy

645
00:24:30,910 --> 00:24:37,179
right this I couldn't believe it when I

646
00:24:34,510 --> 00:24:40,929
saw it but unfortunately we knew already

647
00:24:37,179 --> 00:24:43,000
that it was not built on top of

648
00:24:40,929 --> 00:24:45,130
compromised infrastructure so we had to

649
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:46,990
let go but also we found out that Trend

650
00:24:45,130 --> 00:24:49,300
Micro did a really good study about this

651
00:24:46,990 --> 00:24:51,160
but I don't think this is the end for

652
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:52,780
Illuminati I think this this kind of

653
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:54,730
stuff should be illegal and I think for

654
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:56,770
us it's pretty shocking but maybe I

655
00:24:54,730 --> 00:24:59,110
don't know we'll see this is clearly a

656
00:24:56,770 --> 00:25:00,580
next chapter in the Illuminati story but

657
00:24:59,110 --> 00:25:04,000
we haven't covered it because we knew it

658
00:25:00,580 --> 00:25:05,770
was like the user option basically so

659
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,570
the results of our research regarding

660
00:25:05,770 --> 00:25:10,240
the various residential proxies are the

661
00:25:07,570 --> 00:25:11,740
follow as follows we purchase from storm

662
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:13,450
proxies and I skipped a few of them

663
00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:15,280
where the result were redundant for

664
00:25:13,450 --> 00:25:17,740
timing issue as you can see we're going

665
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:20,200
through a lot of content here we receive

666
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:23,140
like piece from the US and what I found

667
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:25,690
interesting is that the the is Whois

668
00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:28,420
database and the geo database from those

669
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:31,360
IPs has had conflicting information here

670
00:25:28,420 --> 00:25:34,300
we have an ISP that says digital energy

671
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:37,389
technology Schiele which is a legal ISP

672
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:39,820
that exists but the organization is a

673
00:25:37,390 --> 00:25:42,580
host one plus which is a hosting

674
00:25:39,820 --> 00:25:44,669
provider like semi-great bulletproof

675
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:47,320
operating in the u.s. a lot and

676
00:25:44,670 --> 00:25:49,840
traceroute led to the u.s. there was

677
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:52,780
another example where Victoria maje

678
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:54,269
legit ISP from Africa but the

679
00:25:52,780 --> 00:25:57,658
organization name was Jose

680
00:25:54,269 --> 00:26:01,440
Center another US operation so again you

681
00:25:57,659 --> 00:26:03,809
know maybe this is why they abuse this

682
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:05,849
kind of mismatch of information by

683
00:26:03,809 --> 00:26:09,178
purchasing IPS and the database is not

684
00:26:05,849 --> 00:26:11,458
updated this could be a lead here so now

685
00:26:09,179 --> 00:26:13,979
we started scanning it and we kind of

686
00:26:11,459 --> 00:26:16,200
did local scan using nmap through the

687
00:26:13,979 --> 00:26:18,779
such proxy and then external scans and

688
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:20,909
trying to see how it was built how it

689
00:26:18,779 --> 00:26:22,049
worked and we found out that they uses

690
00:26:20,909 --> 00:26:23,940
squid for proxying

691
00:26:22,049 --> 00:26:25,769
stone proxies and they don't protect

692
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:28,649
scans from localhost so we were able to

693
00:26:25,769 --> 00:26:30,359
fingerprint the the operating system by

694
00:26:28,649 --> 00:26:36,809
correlating the information from the

695
00:26:30,359 --> 00:26:38,609
squid proxy and the SMTP server what we

696
00:26:36,809 --> 00:26:40,559
found out is that it's most likely using

697
00:26:38,609 --> 00:26:42,599
Debian Jesse and we know Debian you know

698
00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:44,219
back port security patches and so

699
00:26:42,599 --> 00:26:46,708
version numbers are pretty static for a

700
00:26:44,219 --> 00:26:48,959
given Debian release so we know for for

701
00:26:46,709 --> 00:26:51,899
sure that this is a Debian justice

702
00:26:48,959 --> 00:26:54,359
system now moving on to our socks it was

703
00:26:51,899 --> 00:26:56,339
very different in the way that the the

704
00:26:54,359 --> 00:26:58,589
IPS were provided they were all from the

705
00:26:56,339 --> 00:27:02,820
same subnet so easier to block I would

706
00:26:58,589 --> 00:27:06,479
assume in Russia the ISP from the geoip

707
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:08,458
database was admin LLC and when you

708
00:27:06,479 --> 00:27:10,229
google about that ISP you don't get any

709
00:27:08,459 --> 00:27:11,759
result so should you block it should you

710
00:27:10,229 --> 00:27:15,179
not block it it's not clear but it's

711
00:27:11,759 --> 00:27:17,329
clearly not a data center and the

712
00:27:15,179 --> 00:27:19,919
traceroute confirmed that it was really

713
00:27:17,329 --> 00:27:21,389
coming from Russia it's supported more

714
00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:24,149
protocols at the other residence

715
00:27:21,389 --> 00:27:28,439
processes we studied with the addition

716
00:27:24,149 --> 00:27:30,779
of socks far 4 and 5 to it when we scan

717
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:33,419
that we found out that it exposed SSH on

718
00:27:30,779 --> 00:27:36,899
three three eight nine internally not to

719
00:27:33,419 --> 00:27:39,839
the outside world this gave us the SSH

720
00:27:36,899 --> 00:27:41,928
manner which identified without a doubt

721
00:27:39,839 --> 00:27:44,059
that it's a Debian GC server

722
00:27:41,929 --> 00:27:46,529
unfortunately we were not able to a

723
00:27:44,059 --> 00:27:49,099
fingerprint the proxy service which

724
00:27:46,529 --> 00:27:52,259
would maybe hint that it could be custom

725
00:27:49,099 --> 00:27:54,539
so that's that for our socks

726
00:27:52,259 --> 00:27:57,719
Vala solution Bala solution doesn't

727
00:27:54,539 --> 00:28:00,059
offer a panel it sends the IP address

728
00:27:57,719 --> 00:28:03,629
and the the user name and password to

729
00:28:00,059 --> 00:28:06,299
use in discord message so I have to show

730
00:28:03,629 --> 00:28:07,800
you the glorious web page again we

731
00:28:06,299 --> 00:28:10,170
received a single IP from

732
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:13,200
France which was clearly a dedicated

733
00:28:10,170 --> 00:28:14,610
service provider and the Falla solution

734
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:17,280
as opposed to the other residential

735
00:28:14,610 --> 00:28:19,290
proxy providers tunnel the traffic so if

736
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:21,420
you do what's my IP you would get a

737
00:28:19,290 --> 00:28:22,950
different IP than what you connect to

738
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:26,280
which is not what the others were doing

739
00:28:22,950 --> 00:28:28,560
and the traffic went out in the US with

740
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:32,760
a properly labeled AT&T Internet

741
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:36,570
services label and the traffic out was

742
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:39,480
ipv6 only you couldn't do ipv4

743
00:28:36,570 --> 00:28:42,570
so the Geo IP information from this gave

744
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:44,550
a lake okay I know it's not you know

745
00:28:42,570 --> 00:28:46,110
accurate geoip inform and there's a

746
00:28:44,550 --> 00:28:48,330
radius which I we need to take into

747
00:28:46,110 --> 00:28:50,820
account but I find the idea of an

748
00:28:48,330 --> 00:28:53,460
underground data center beside below a

749
00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:56,970
lake in Kansas funny so I put this light

750
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:58,980
in there for you Valerie uses three

751
00:28:56,970 --> 00:29:02,010
proxy tree proxy is a very well-known

752
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:03,930
for malware researchers a Russian open

753
00:29:02,010 --> 00:29:06,090
source proxy server which supports a

754
00:29:03,930 --> 00:29:09,210
very numerous amount of protocols and

755
00:29:06,090 --> 00:29:11,100
tunneling techniques it was exposed on a

756
00:29:09,210 --> 00:29:13,350
thousand and sixty-seven non-continuous

757
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:16,679
port we identify it by n map and with

758
00:29:13,350 --> 00:29:19,889
source code correlation their deployment

759
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:21,360
protected local host from from scans so

760
00:29:19,890 --> 00:29:24,630
they were the only one protected local

761
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:26,879
scans both ipv4 and ipv6 and from the

762
00:29:24,630 --> 00:29:28,890
outside when scanning the ipv6 IP you

763
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:32,130
would get no result at all not a single

764
00:29:28,890 --> 00:29:36,870
service not an OS fingerprint from there

765
00:29:32,130 --> 00:29:40,260
so 100% filtered so but the proxy and

766
00:29:36,870 --> 00:29:43,469
the SSH service on the entry so the ipv4

767
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:45,210
and France entry of that service was

768
00:29:43,470 --> 00:29:50,220
running Debian nine with nginx and

769
00:29:45,210 --> 00:29:52,650
OpenSSH Vala was clearly the the other

770
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:54,390
were clearly you know I sis and in the

771
00:29:52,650 --> 00:29:56,490
work of assistant min and not compromise

772
00:29:54,390 --> 00:29:58,050
infrastructure because all of the IPS

773
00:29:56,490 --> 00:30:00,210
were similar running Debian and stuff

774
00:29:58,050 --> 00:30:02,159
like that they were all correlated but

775
00:30:00,210 --> 00:30:04,020
the Vala host is the one that was the

776
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:05,400
shadiest where we couldn't really

777
00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:07,830
pinpoint if it was running and

778
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:10,260
compromised infrastructure or not so

779
00:30:07,830 --> 00:30:12,090
this is summary of all the findings and

780
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:14,129
this is left as a reference for those

781
00:30:12,090 --> 00:30:15,780
who will download the slide and who

782
00:30:14,130 --> 00:30:17,030
needs this for work or would be

783
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:19,470
interested in pursuing our research

784
00:30:17,030 --> 00:30:20,260
lastly before moving on I wanted to give

785
00:30:19,470 --> 00:30:24,820
a shout out

786
00:30:20,260 --> 00:30:27,820
to a paper that is that went out this

787
00:30:24,820 --> 00:30:30,280
year called Resident Evil understanding

788
00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:33,460
residential IP proxy as a dark service

789
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:35,500
so a pretty funny clever name it's a

790
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:37,600
collaboration between Indiana University

791
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:39,580
Bloomington and seing how University

792
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:43,629
with more than 10 people on that paper

793
00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:45,760
and what they did is they had access to

794
00:30:43,630 --> 00:30:47,710
traffic so they had deals with ISPs and

795
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:49,480
so this paper is a very different

796
00:30:47,710 --> 00:30:52,450
approach than us where we were trying to

797
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:54,760
assess and first compromised or not but

798
00:30:52,450 --> 00:30:56,740
it's worth a look because of that

799
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:59,790
different approach and what happens to

800
00:30:56,740 --> 00:31:03,490
those residential proxy services is

801
00:30:59,790 --> 00:31:06,370
inside that paper for you to look at so

802
00:31:03,490 --> 00:31:08,950
where do we stand now so we have an IOT

803
00:31:06,370 --> 00:31:10,629
botnet or residential proxy services

804
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:12,730
different business model different

805
00:31:10,630 --> 00:31:16,120
different pricing we have automation

806
00:31:12,730 --> 00:31:21,250
software we have reseller panels and

807
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:23,139
panels as service providers but who buys

808
00:31:21,250 --> 00:31:25,660
from the reseller panel so we need to

809
00:31:23,140 --> 00:31:27,490
see from the buying standpoint and

810
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:30,370
there's someone buying from the reseller

811
00:31:27,490 --> 00:31:33,820
before the the end-users right and so

812
00:31:30,370 --> 00:31:36,100
Massaro is gonna cover this actor yes so

813
00:31:33,820 --> 00:31:37,960
who buy some the reseller panel well we

814
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:40,000
call them the customer facing sellers

815
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:41,410
and they're the one killing out in the

816
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,850
tree and being cool because they're the

817
00:31:41,410 --> 00:31:45,250
one dealing with the celebrities and the

818
00:31:42,850 --> 00:31:47,559
agencies right so here I give you an

819
00:31:45,250 --> 00:31:49,330
example of a customer facing seller so

820
00:31:47,559 --> 00:31:51,129
they're they look much more legitimate

821
00:31:49,330 --> 00:31:52,840
than the bulky selling panels they

822
00:31:51,130 --> 00:31:54,700
actually offer really good process

823
00:31:52,840 --> 00:32:00,189
payments like credit cards and all that

824
00:31:54,700 --> 00:32:01,510
and they have a much higher price I put

825
00:32:00,190 --> 00:32:03,669
here the famiy because it's got a very

826
00:32:01,510 --> 00:32:08,980
interesting story have you heard of it

827
00:32:03,669 --> 00:32:10,630
I guess maybe but I won't know so Vivien

828
00:32:08,980 --> 00:32:12,160
Leigh got into a legal proceeding with

829
00:32:10,630 --> 00:32:14,710
one of their partners and they had to

830
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:17,260
disclose their customers and following

831
00:32:14,710 --> 00:32:18,970
that New York Times journalist sort of

832
00:32:17,260 --> 00:32:20,919
took that opportunity and created an

833
00:32:18,970 --> 00:32:23,950
investigation called a follower factory

834
00:32:20,919 --> 00:32:26,290
in that investigation they actually used

835
00:32:23,950 --> 00:32:28,659
a customer list that was being displayed

836
00:32:26,290 --> 00:32:30,490
due to the legal procedures and they

837
00:32:28,659 --> 00:32:32,530
started to talk about how you could buy

838
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:33,740
fake likes online in like flagging

839
00:32:32,530 --> 00:32:35,750
people who were

840
00:32:33,740 --> 00:32:37,880
customers of divinity what's interesting

841
00:32:35,750 --> 00:32:40,550
from this is that the New York Attorney

842
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:45,800
General took that investigation and even

843
00:32:40,550 --> 00:32:47,870
made it into illegal undertaken so Eddy

844
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:50,590
announced a groundbreaking settlement in

845
00:32:47,870 --> 00:32:52,939
January 2019 where they said that

846
00:32:50,590 --> 00:32:55,010
selling fake followers and lights is

847
00:32:52,940 --> 00:32:56,360
illegal deception and what they did is

848
00:32:55,010 --> 00:32:58,010
they find there for me for fifty

849
00:32:56,360 --> 00:33:00,500
thousand dollars which is kind of a

850
00:32:58,010 --> 00:33:01,520
small fine considering that the New York

851
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:02,840
Times journalist said that they've

852
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:05,690
really made about a few million dollars

853
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:08,870
a year but it's still interesting but it

854
00:33:05,690 --> 00:33:10,970
gives us an idea of what can be done in

855
00:33:08,870 --> 00:33:12,469
one state and what could be done within

856
00:33:10,970 --> 00:33:15,710
other states and within other countries

857
00:33:12,470 --> 00:33:17,420
right and then obviously differently

858
00:33:15,710 --> 00:33:19,100
closed down following that investigation

859
00:33:17,420 --> 00:33:21,050
just because all their customers were

860
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:24,260
being you know like shamed by the New

861
00:33:21,050 --> 00:33:26,240
York Times journalist but they did pose

862
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:27,850
down but it's not certain they actually

863
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:30,110
forward you towards other

864
00:33:27,850 --> 00:33:32,149
customer-facing sellers such as social

865
00:33:30,110 --> 00:33:36,169
basta org into the growing and YouTube

866
00:33:32,150 --> 00:33:39,290
growth and then finally the buyers right

867
00:33:36,170 --> 00:33:42,620
the ones that are driving this we

868
00:33:39,290 --> 00:33:44,420
picture them as squirrels so they yield

869
00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:46,370
at the top of the tree above everybody

870
00:33:44,420 --> 00:33:48,080
because they sort of drive that business

871
00:33:46,370 --> 00:33:51,520
and that the closest one to social

872
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:53,689
networks so how did we sort of

873
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:55,970
understand potential buyers so this

874
00:33:53,690 --> 00:33:57,830
dates back to our 2015 investigation

875
00:33:55,970 --> 00:33:59,270
when we had access to that we actually

876
00:33:57,830 --> 00:34:01,460
still have access to that plane just

877
00:33:59,270 --> 00:34:03,470
traffic we knew that Linux moose was

878
00:34:01,460 --> 00:34:04,970
focusing mainly on Instagram so eighty

879
00:34:03,470 --> 00:34:07,429
six percent of the traffic was going

880
00:34:04,970 --> 00:34:09,710
there so we looked at the Instagram

881
00:34:07,429 --> 00:34:11,869
traffic and all the accounts that were

882
00:34:09,710 --> 00:34:13,580
being liked by Linux moose so we

883
00:34:11,869 --> 00:34:15,950
developed a sort of methodology where

884
00:34:13,580 --> 00:34:17,569
Linux moose had to have liked an account

885
00:34:15,949 --> 00:34:20,658
or followed an account more than five

886
00:34:17,570 --> 00:34:23,750
times it had to not be somebody like Kim

887
00:34:20,659 --> 00:34:25,609
Kardashian or other popular people on

888
00:34:23,750 --> 00:34:27,109
Instagram because we know that they're

889
00:34:25,609 --> 00:34:29,869
actually following these people to look

890
00:34:27,109 --> 00:34:31,250
more human and it had to have a low

891
00:34:29,869 --> 00:34:32,869
engagement so you have a hundred

892
00:34:31,250 --> 00:34:34,580
thousand followers that when you post a

893
00:34:32,869 --> 00:34:36,649
picture you have two or three or five

894
00:34:34,580 --> 00:34:38,810
fifty likes and it does show us that

895
00:34:36,649 --> 00:34:40,699
it's probably false I know there's some

896
00:34:38,810 --> 00:34:42,500
agencies that say that four percent like

897
00:34:40,699 --> 00:34:43,879
in terms of engagement so if you divide

898
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:46,250
the number of likes on the picture

899
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:47,960
/ the number of followers it's 4% that

900
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:49,600
gives you an idea whether or not there's

901
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:52,580
five false followers in the following

902
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:54,290
and then we developed a Content analysis

903
00:34:52,580 --> 00:34:56,540
which is mean just mean which means

904
00:34:54,290 --> 00:34:58,400
basically out of the 500 accounts we had

905
00:34:56,540 --> 00:35:01,190
for potential buyers which is categorize

906
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:03,290
them what we found mainly is 20% of our

907
00:35:01,190 --> 00:35:05,300
sample with entertainment industry so

908
00:35:03,290 --> 00:35:07,130
singers like this guy who had over

909
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:08,210
30,000 followers but when you went on

910
00:35:07,130 --> 00:35:11,810
his YouTube account

911
00:35:08,210 --> 00:35:14,810
it was much lower or guys like this

912
00:35:11,810 --> 00:35:18,080
person who is a TV personality actor

913
00:35:14,810 --> 00:35:20,779
global jet setter self-made so

914
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:23,930
entertainment industry we found lots of

915
00:35:20,780 --> 00:35:27,620
selling products and services so 21% of

916
00:35:23,930 --> 00:35:30,190
our sample so it was the product that

917
00:35:27,620 --> 00:35:33,460
was always luxurious so here you have

918
00:35:30,190 --> 00:35:35,750
watches but we had also jewelry's and

919
00:35:33,460 --> 00:35:37,250
most of the branding was around the

920
00:35:35,750 --> 00:35:40,690
thing the fact that it was luxury

921
00:35:37,250 --> 00:35:43,390
luxurious if I can say that word and

922
00:35:40,690 --> 00:35:46,370
unfortunately had like a quarter of our

923
00:35:43,390 --> 00:35:47,990
sample was personal profiles so these

924
00:35:46,370 --> 00:35:49,819
were individuals that didn't have any

925
00:35:47,990 --> 00:35:51,379
business models to actually burn fake

926
00:35:49,820 --> 00:35:53,780
likes and follows but they still did

927
00:35:51,380 --> 00:35:56,180
this sort of drove our analysis saying

928
00:35:53,780 --> 00:35:57,890
that it was ego market because you know

929
00:35:56,180 --> 00:36:00,200
if you post pictures of your food and

930
00:35:57,890 --> 00:36:03,140
then you buy followers if you're aware

931
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:04,490
that they're false so but yeah and this

932
00:36:03,140 --> 00:36:08,870
is more of a another psychological

933
00:36:04,490 --> 00:36:11,629
research that has to be done and then

934
00:36:08,870 --> 00:36:14,900
there's the unexpected ones so this was

935
00:36:11,630 --> 00:36:17,270
about like 65% of our sample and there

936
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:19,070
was a 30% something of our sample that I

937
00:36:17,270 --> 00:36:21,200
couldn't categorize because the things

938
00:36:19,070 --> 00:36:23,420
were so special all the time and then I

939
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:25,669
just highlighted the unexpected ones so

940
00:36:23,420 --> 00:36:28,880
we found that Araki general from the

941
00:36:25,670 --> 00:36:30,680
Iraqi forces we don't know just remember

942
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:32,600
it's potential buyers like we haven't

943
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:34,759
seen them buying but this person is

944
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:36,799
actually involved in the military we we

945
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:37,430
looked at that and they were paired in

946
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:40,970
our traffic

947
00:36:37,430 --> 00:36:42,910
we also found Lots well a few accounts

948
00:36:40,970 --> 00:36:45,980
that were related to spiritual magics

949
00:36:42,910 --> 00:36:48,200
magicians hypnotist so here I give you

950
00:36:45,980 --> 00:36:50,990
an example of a lady who's exciting

951
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:52,669
spiritual reading magic and

952
00:36:50,990 --> 00:36:54,618
interestingly she caught herself at home

953
00:36:52,670 --> 00:37:00,260
which which I'm not sure what it means

954
00:36:54,619 --> 00:37:03,320
but yeah and then the fascinating one so

955
00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:07,160
the those are the ones it sort of yeah

956
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:09,740
it's all just show so here we have an

957
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:12,259
STD testing company it makes sense that

958
00:37:09,740 --> 00:37:14,899
people on Instagram would not follow an

959
00:37:12,260 --> 00:37:16,660
STD company so it did make sense that

960
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:19,010
they bought followers for credibility

961
00:37:16,660 --> 00:37:21,259
without the agency related to their

962
00:37:19,010 --> 00:37:23,750
marketing was doing that and we found

963
00:37:21,260 --> 00:37:26,240
dogs with more money than you see how

964
00:37:23,750 --> 00:37:30,110
can you how can you categorize that

965
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:31,640
right that's a thing and it's always

966
00:37:30,110 --> 00:37:35,240
good to remember that there's dogs with

967
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:37,160
more money than you right and then we

968
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:43,368
made an experiment and I just hope you

969
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:44,899
get it it's a duck face right so we knew

970
00:37:43,369 --> 00:37:47,060
Linux moose targeted social networks

971
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:48,710
mainly Instagram right but we knew it

972
00:37:47,060 --> 00:37:51,350
was going on Twitter and on three other

973
00:37:48,710 --> 00:37:54,080
very odd social networks so periscope

974
00:37:51,350 --> 00:37:55,580
Kiwi and papaya Graham Kiwi is now not

975
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:56,990
working anymore but at the time it was a

976
00:37:55,580 --> 00:38:00,470
social network we could ask questions

977
00:37:56,990 --> 00:38:03,169
and like you asked question and people

978
00:38:00,470 --> 00:38:05,419
would answer on them and we found them

979
00:38:03,170 --> 00:38:08,119
and a customer-facing seller that was

980
00:38:05,420 --> 00:38:11,420
actually selling Instagram flipagram

981
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:13,070
face cup and qe services so you could go

982
00:38:11,420 --> 00:38:15,350
and boy I don't know likes on your

983
00:38:13,070 --> 00:38:18,619
questions 4qe so we thought at that time

984
00:38:15,350 --> 00:38:20,509
well it fits very well in between you

985
00:38:18,619 --> 00:38:22,760
and our customer and customer sorry

986
00:38:20,510 --> 00:38:25,070
customer facing feller and what we see

987
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:27,740
in Linux most traffic it fits very well

988
00:38:25,070 --> 00:38:29,720
so what we did is we created a fake

989
00:38:27,740 --> 00:38:31,640
account called beautiful birth 33 I

990
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:32,959
think at that time I was sort of buzzed

991
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:35,180
by Instagram looking at too many

992
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:38,359
profiles I ended up doing a profile that

993
00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:40,879
with legitimate and we bought 6,000

994
00:38:38,359 --> 00:38:43,220
followers from that customer facing

995
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:44,900
seller we ended up with 8,000 due to a

996
00:38:43,220 --> 00:38:48,830
story of me complaining not having

997
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:50,990
enough and the account ended up in our

998
00:38:48,830 --> 00:38:52,640
honey pots traffic so this was a very

999
00:38:50,990 --> 00:38:55,160
good day for us and a very good moment

1000
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:57,109
because we hypothesized house of you

1001
00:38:55,160 --> 00:39:01,009
know like oh let's see and it ended up

1002
00:38:57,109 --> 00:39:03,350
being an RI traffic in our honey buds so

1003
00:39:01,010 --> 00:39:04,400
from this Blake sort of experiment what

1004
00:39:03,350 --> 00:39:06,440
we can say is

1005
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:09,740
from acting as the buyer and we bought

1006
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:11,390
on a customer facing seller person and

1007
00:39:09,740 --> 00:39:12,859
then we saw the traffic going through

1008
00:39:11,390 --> 00:39:14,270
with the Linux mouse button right so

1009
00:39:12,859 --> 00:39:16,308
what we don't know is exactly what

1010
00:39:14,270 --> 00:39:18,079
happened in the middle then the customer

1011
00:39:16,309 --> 00:39:20,000
facing seller actually purchased from a

1012
00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:23,740
reseller panel and all that but we knew

1013
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:26,779
that it was connected to our but net and

1014
00:39:23,740 --> 00:39:30,259
then revenues so this is the crunchy

1015
00:39:26,779 --> 00:39:33,680
part right in 2016 when we presented at

1016
00:39:30,260 --> 00:39:36,170
blackhat Europe what we did was take the

1017
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:38,210
number of thoughts that sorry the number

1018
00:39:36,170 --> 00:39:40,549
of follows that each of our honey buds

1019
00:39:38,210 --> 00:39:43,400
did which amounted per month of about a

1020
00:39:40,549 --> 00:39:45,950
thousand hollows and we looked at the

1021
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:47,900
customer facing sellers prices and we

1022
00:39:45,950 --> 00:39:50,240
hypothesized that based on the number of

1023
00:39:47,900 --> 00:39:52,460
butts Linux MOOCs had how much money

1024
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:54,259
would be making per month right so this

1025
00:39:52,460 --> 00:39:55,700
was just an estimation and we were like

1026
00:39:54,260 --> 00:39:57,529
well if it has three thousand bucks

1027
00:39:55,700 --> 00:39:59,660
which is not that much then it would

1028
00:39:57,529 --> 00:40:01,819
make on average four hundred thousand

1029
00:39:59,660 --> 00:40:03,170
dollars per month which seems to be

1030
00:40:01,819 --> 00:40:06,109
quite extensive like quite a lot of

1031
00:40:03,170 --> 00:40:07,880
money right so we we sort of gave all

1032
00:40:06,109 --> 00:40:11,240
the profit from the industry to Linux

1033
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:12,950
moves following our investigation though

1034
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:14,538
you do understand now that there's many

1035
00:40:12,950 --> 00:40:16,189
levels right and the Linux news

1036
00:40:14,539 --> 00:40:19,700
providers are actually not making that

1037
00:40:16,190 --> 00:40:21,859
much money out of as we expected so

1038
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:25,220
let's do a little exercise ok squirrel

1039
00:40:21,859 --> 00:40:28,880
or Bowyer boys ten thousand Instagram

1040
00:40:25,220 --> 00:40:30,470
followers okay that buyer goes on a

1041
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:33,079
customer facing seller and we gathered

1042
00:40:30,470 --> 00:40:35,890
information on 36 of them and the median

1043
00:40:33,079 --> 00:40:38,390
price was $95 for 10,000 followers

1044
00:40:35,890 --> 00:40:39,890
it's the median price because we can

1045
00:40:38,390 --> 00:40:43,129
take the average the standard deviation

1046
00:40:39,890 --> 00:40:44,779
was going all over and then let's

1047
00:40:43,130 --> 00:40:46,910
hypothesize that customer and face

1048
00:40:44,779 --> 00:40:48,920
customer facing seller would go on

1049
00:40:46,910 --> 00:40:51,589
reseller panels and the median price of

1050
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:53,150
these panels out of 33 of them which we

1051
00:40:51,589 --> 00:40:56,779
focus only on our targeted followers

1052
00:40:53,150 --> 00:40:58,579
services who is $22 well how much would

1053
00:40:56,779 --> 00:41:01,190
Linux most make right how much could

1054
00:40:58,579 --> 00:41:02,779
they make out of this well the cheapest

1055
00:41:01,190 --> 00:41:04,880
reseller panel that we found where I try

1056
00:41:02,779 --> 00:41:07,700
to buy a million followers with shady

1057
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:11,270
payment processing offered ten thousand

1058
00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:12,558
followers for 1.8 dollars is Linux most

1059
00:41:11,270 --> 00:41:13,579
related to the cheapest reseller panel

1060
00:41:12,559 --> 00:41:14,900
is something that we don't know

1061
00:41:13,579 --> 00:41:18,080
something that we'd have to investigate

1062
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:20,510
more but that's an idea

1063
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:22,790
meanwhile in the industry there's other

1064
00:41:20,510 --> 00:41:25,130
people making money so you have the

1065
00:41:22,790 --> 00:41:27,440
software the panel as a service provider

1066
00:41:25,130 --> 00:41:30,890
remember our wolf who makes a lot of

1067
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:34,160
money so it make on average forty seven

1068
00:41:30,890 --> 00:41:36,020
dollars a month and that's based on one

1069
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:37,899
client so if you have many clients you

1070
00:41:36,020 --> 00:41:40,130
make a lot of money on out of month

1071
00:41:37,900 --> 00:41:42,170
residential proxy services were two

1072
00:41:40,130 --> 00:41:45,710
dollars per proxy per month on average

1073
00:41:42,170 --> 00:41:47,510
and the automation software panels were

1074
00:41:45,710 --> 00:41:50,870
actually sorry automation software we're

1075
00:41:47,510 --> 00:41:54,380
making between $10 to $60 a month as

1076
00:41:50,870 --> 00:41:56,750
well so let's do a little exercise like

1077
00:41:54,380 --> 00:41:58,610
you you want to be trending you're

1078
00:41:56,750 --> 00:42:00,230
somebody who are you're doing a run and

1079
00:41:58,610 --> 00:42:02,270
you want to be trending and you want to

1080
00:42:00,230 --> 00:42:04,040
buy 10,000 followers provided within a

1081
00:42:02,270 --> 00:42:06,560
week right so while you do your event

1082
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:09,050
then you get popular we know that each

1083
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:11,180
but related to Linux moves performed on

1084
00:42:09,050 --> 00:42:13,460
average a thousand follows per month on

1085
00:42:11,180 --> 00:42:17,509
Instagram and why it isn't that much is

1086
00:42:13,460 --> 00:42:19,610
mainly because it has to fake human-like

1087
00:42:17,510 --> 00:42:20,840
human activity so it capped you know

1088
00:42:19,610 --> 00:42:23,120
just go like follow follow follow follow

1089
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:25,010
follow it goes into and box and then it

1090
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:27,529
fakes a lot of human activity out of the

1091
00:42:25,010 --> 00:42:29,900
honey pots and that data equals two to

1092
00:42:27,530 --> 00:42:32,330
two hundred and eighty follows per week

1093
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:35,840
so if we have for example we take just

1094
00:42:32,330 --> 00:42:37,819
$2 for proxy per month to actually being

1095
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:40,160
able to perform 10,000 followers you

1096
00:42:37,820 --> 00:42:43,010
would need 36 trucks at a median cost of

1097
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:45,500
$2 so you will have a flat force of $72

1098
00:42:43,010 --> 00:42:48,650
which is quite expensive right it's not

1099
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:50,750
really possible to make that and this is

1100
00:42:48,650 --> 00:42:52,940
a little bit probably why automation

1101
00:42:50,750 --> 00:42:55,640
through infected devices is used for

1102
00:42:52,940 --> 00:42:59,990
fake likes and follows or why velocity

1103
00:42:55,640 --> 00:43:01,730
so exist just to notify like Vala was we

1104
00:42:59,990 --> 00:43:03,799
thought that the proxy were kind of

1105
00:43:01,730 --> 00:43:06,290
shady but they sell their proxy at 50

1106
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:08,420
cents which is much cheaper per month

1107
00:43:06,290 --> 00:43:10,100
than the others and just just to say

1108
00:43:08,420 --> 00:43:11,720
they actually send you the proxy through

1109
00:43:10,100 --> 00:43:15,920
email and then you can go on a discord

1110
00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:18,319
server to talk about it let's continue

1111
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:22,760
on estimates Linux moves capacity right

1112
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:24,770
so let's say Linux moves have like so

1113
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:27,260
you have on the axis the number of bots

1114
00:43:24,770 --> 00:43:28,880
and on the vertical axis the number of

1115
00:43:27,260 --> 00:43:31,190
monthly Instagram follows that Linux

1116
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:31,430
Moo's can do so if Newton who's had four

1117
00:43:31,190 --> 00:43:34,550
eggs

1118
00:43:31,430 --> 00:43:37,190
40,000 but it could do on average a bit

1119
00:43:34,550 --> 00:43:39,920
above 40 million follows per month okay

1120
00:43:37,190 --> 00:43:41,869
and then it's sad because we don't know

1121
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:43,670
exactly how much money a Linux post is

1122
00:43:41,869 --> 00:43:46,030
making or how much they are selling

1123
00:43:43,670 --> 00:43:48,619
their fake followers but we know that

1124
00:43:46,030 --> 00:43:50,750
based on the reseller panel prices we

1125
00:43:48,619 --> 00:43:54,050
know that the cheapest price was 1.8 and

1126
00:43:50,750 --> 00:43:57,470
then the first quarter price was $12 and

1127
00:43:54,050 --> 00:43:59,000
the median price was $22 so basically

1128
00:43:57,470 --> 00:44:01,399
what you have to be like the main main

1129
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:02,930
takeaway from this is to see that if it

1130
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:05,030
was actually related to the cheapest

1131
00:44:02,930 --> 00:44:06,710
reseller Linux Mo's would make much less

1132
00:44:05,030 --> 00:44:09,890
money than we previously expected right

1133
00:44:06,710 --> 00:44:11,980
because if it had 40,000 bucks it would

1134
00:44:09,890 --> 00:44:14,240
make less than 50 year like less than

1135
00:44:11,980 --> 00:44:15,680
$25,000 but if it was close to the

1136
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:18,229
medium price then it would make much

1137
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:19,759
more money but overall it's making less

1138
00:44:18,230 --> 00:44:21,079
money than we first expected and it's

1139
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:23,119
often something that we have to do as

1140
00:44:21,079 --> 00:44:24,800
researchers like we have like we always

1141
00:44:23,119 --> 00:44:26,150
like say you prices and see malicious

1142
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:27,710
activity and link them together but

1143
00:44:26,150 --> 00:44:29,359
there's potentially actors in the middle

1144
00:44:27,710 --> 00:44:30,760
that are actually making out money out

1145
00:44:29,359 --> 00:44:33,980
of this too

1146
00:44:30,760 --> 00:44:35,750
so this sort of finalizes our ecosystem

1147
00:44:33,980 --> 00:44:37,910
of social media manipulations so you

1148
00:44:35,750 --> 00:44:41,720
have buyers customer-facing sellers

1149
00:44:37,910 --> 00:44:43,490
reseller panels software panel has the

1150
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:46,868
service providers automation software

1151
00:44:43,490 --> 00:44:49,069
Linux mousse and residential proxies

1152
00:44:46,869 --> 00:44:50,930
there's other research avenues that I

1153
00:44:49,069 --> 00:44:52,849
want to mention so obviously Linux

1154
00:44:50,930 --> 00:44:54,440
mousse is a way to automate fake likes

1155
00:44:52,849 --> 00:44:56,690
and follows but there exist also click

1156
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:57,980
farms compromised accounts where an

1157
00:44:56,690 --> 00:44:59,960
individual gets their accounts

1158
00:44:57,980 --> 00:45:02,510
compromised and then it likes other

1159
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:04,339
people without knowing antral farms as

1160
00:45:02,510 --> 00:45:06,230
well we know with the whole scandal

1161
00:45:04,339 --> 00:45:07,880
about Russia and there's some

1162
00:45:06,230 --> 00:45:12,079
researchers working on this right now so

1163
00:45:07,880 --> 00:45:13,990
there's a researcher called it's his

1164
00:45:12,079 --> 00:45:16,520
name again

1165
00:45:13,990 --> 00:45:19,520
Patrick van Darrow and what he does is

1166
00:45:16,520 --> 00:45:22,040
he worked with reseller panels hosted on

1167
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:23,930
a perfect panel and he interviewed them

1168
00:45:22,040 --> 00:45:25,520
so like interesting findings are gonna

1169
00:45:23,930 --> 00:45:27,740
come out from this and as researchers

1170
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:30,230
from a journalist organisation to

1171
00:45:27,740 --> 00:45:32,180
interviewing people so if you have hints

1172
00:45:30,230 --> 00:45:34,099
on that I could like link you all all of

1173
00:45:32,180 --> 00:45:38,029
you together but like findings will be

1174
00:45:34,099 --> 00:45:40,880
published soon so what to do next very

1175
00:45:38,030 --> 00:45:42,410
quickly for policy makers well we

1176
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:43,880
thought looking to the sale of social

1177
00:45:42,410 --> 00:45:45,890
media manipulation right

1178
00:45:43,880 --> 00:45:48,170
and we know that the New York time the

1179
00:45:45,890 --> 00:45:49,910
New York Attorney General actually

1180
00:45:48,170 --> 00:45:51,230
created they made that illegal in their

1181
00:45:49,910 --> 00:45:53,920
states but it's interesting to see

1182
00:45:51,230 --> 00:45:56,480
what's gonna happen in other in other

1183
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:58,040
legislation for law enforcement well

1184
00:45:56,480 --> 00:46:00,140
what we thought was target the middlemen

1185
00:45:58,040 --> 00:46:02,779
so the panel as a service so this person

1186
00:46:00,140 --> 00:46:04,910
is actually enabling so many and non

1187
00:46:02,780 --> 00:46:06,590
technical actors to be involved in the

1188
00:46:04,910 --> 00:46:08,359
game and making money so by targeting

1189
00:46:06,590 --> 00:46:10,430
them it would actually break the link in

1190
00:46:08,360 --> 00:46:12,410
between the IOT but nets and the

1191
00:46:10,430 --> 00:46:14,000
customer facing sellers however like

1192
00:46:12,410 --> 00:46:16,100
that investigation has to know what is

1193
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:19,850
illegal and illegally involved is more

1194
00:46:16,100 --> 00:46:21,470
of a law enforcement work to do and for

1195
00:46:19,850 --> 00:46:25,339
social networks will continue to flag

1196
00:46:21,470 --> 00:46:26,689
any robotic activity so if I did login

1197
00:46:25,340 --> 00:46:28,700
that discourage server and it's

1198
00:46:26,690 --> 00:46:31,280
interesting because right now instagram

1199
00:46:28,700 --> 00:46:33,919
has just published a new AI flagging new

1200
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:35,180
robotic activities and all the people in

1201
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:36,740
the discourse server were actually

1202
00:46:35,180 --> 00:46:39,020
chatting saying that they had a hard

1203
00:46:36,740 --> 00:46:41,390
time creating and like automate but

1204
00:46:39,020 --> 00:46:43,100
creating robotic activity to go do their

1205
00:46:41,390 --> 00:46:45,350
fake likes and follows so it's

1206
00:46:43,100 --> 00:46:47,839
interesting and that was just oddest to

1207
00:46:45,350 --> 00:46:49,970
of this year so it's interesting to see

1208
00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:51,620
that this worked and we're gonna see how

1209
00:46:49,970 --> 00:46:54,950
long it's gonna work and how they're

1210
00:46:51,620 --> 00:46:57,500
gonna bypass that and you individuals

1211
00:46:54,950 --> 00:46:59,540
well maybe focus on the content rather

1212
00:46:57,500 --> 00:47:01,340
than the container like when somebody

1213
00:46:59,540 --> 00:47:02,630
tells you a look at this person has so

1214
00:47:01,340 --> 00:47:03,980
many followers instead of being

1215
00:47:02,630 --> 00:47:05,300
impressed by the number of followers be

1216
00:47:03,980 --> 00:47:06,770
impressed by the content that this

1217
00:47:05,300 --> 00:47:08,990
person is providing and say that to the

1218
00:47:06,770 --> 00:47:11,990
person is so much it could help like

1219
00:47:08,990 --> 00:47:13,459
moving out of that ego society so ask

1220
00:47:11,990 --> 00:47:15,680
yourself what is this person bringing to

1221
00:47:13,460 --> 00:47:20,660
society is this post legit and what are

1222
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:22,520
the sources to and remember I had a

1223
00:47:20,660 --> 00:47:24,680
thousand followers on my beautiful bird

1224
00:47:22,520 --> 00:47:26,480
account but now I only have four hundred

1225
00:47:24,680 --> 00:47:28,640
so when fake accounts are being flagged

1226
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:32,750
you lose your followers so this never

1227
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:34,220
lasts thank you very much if you have

1228
00:47:32,750 --> 00:47:36,080
any questions I think we're gonna move

1229
00:47:34,220 --> 00:47:37,850
somewhere else so we can discuss with

1230
00:47:36,080 --> 00:47:40,340
you otherwise you can follow us on

1231
00:47:37,850 --> 00:47:42,080
Twitter and come talk to us the artwork

1232
00:47:40,340 --> 00:47:43,370
was done by uh somebody in Montreal a

1233
00:47:42,080 --> 00:47:45,200
graphic designer too if you're

1234
00:47:43,370 --> 00:47:49,420
interested and thank you

1235
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:49,419
[Applause]
