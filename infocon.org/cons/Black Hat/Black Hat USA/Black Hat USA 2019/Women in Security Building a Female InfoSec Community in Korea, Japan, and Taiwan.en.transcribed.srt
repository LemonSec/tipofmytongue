[Applause]

22
00:00:52,370 --> 00:00:59,849
hello everyone welcome to our talk today

23
00:00:55,770 --> 00:01:01,949
I'm Asuka Nakajima from NTT and I'm also

24
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:06,090
a regional review board of blackhat

25
00:01:01,949 --> 00:01:08,820
easier so today we would like to talk

26
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:16,049
about building a female insect community

27
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:18,658
in South Korea Japan and Taiwan so as

28
00:01:16,049 --> 00:01:20,970
everyone knows the information security

29
00:01:18,659 --> 00:01:25,340
industry has historically been a

30
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:27,630
male-dominated field and even today

31
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:31,380
unfortunately the situation has not

32
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:34,649
changed much for example the study

33
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:37,649
conducted by Frost & Sullivan in 2007

34
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:40,110
things concluded that will you represent

35
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:46,170
only 11 percent of the information

36
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:47,850
security workforce so while were more

37
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:50,610
women are expected to joining the

38
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:52,949
information security industry still it

39
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:56,700
is difficult to increase their number

40
00:01:52,950 --> 00:02:00,810
because women face many obstacles such a

41
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:04,939
stereotype players like Oh women are not

42
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:08,310
good at programming and engineering and

43
00:02:04,939 --> 00:02:11,220
so based on our experience we've

44
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:13,470
strongly believed that one way to bridge

45
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:16,140
this gap is to

46
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:18,990
female community with skin support and

47
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:24,899
motivate woman and produce more role

48
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:26,780
models so with this in mind today we

49
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:29,070
would like to introduce three

50
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:32,820
representative Asian female communities

51
00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:35,310
power of XX City for girls and hit

52
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:40,440
controls which was established in South

53
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:43,860
Korea Japan and Taiwan so first so he

54
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:45,990
Kong who is a founder of power xx who

55
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:50,190
introduced a female does a community in

56
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:52,380
South Korea and then I Asuka Nakajima

57
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:54,810
the founder of city of Ur girls will

58
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:55,410
introduce the female to the community in

59
00:02:54,810 --> 00:02:59,820
Japan

60
00:02:55,410 --> 00:03:02,730
and lastly hazel yang the co-founder of

61
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:06,750
hip congress who introduced a theme of

62
00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:10,649
the community in Taiwan so during the

63
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:13,410
talk we will give details on how we do

64
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:16,410
the maintainer communities and what we

65
00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:20,489
have achieved and how we tackle various

66
00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:23,720
challenges so based on a talk we

67
00:03:20,489 --> 00:03:26,580
strongly believe that we could provide a

68
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:29,310
insight that could help start a new

69
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:31,200
female into the community and encourage

70
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:35,940
other existing female into the

71
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:44,280
communities okay so let us begin

72
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:46,200
yeah hi everyone thanks for coming today

73
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:49,650
this is quite a few more people than I

74
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:54,179
expected so I really appreciate I'm

75
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:57,120
Sookie from Korea and the issue that I'm

76
00:03:54,180 --> 00:04:01,590
going to talk about today is women cyber

77
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:04,799
security community in Korea now I'm

78
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:07,560
working for PC security which organizes

79
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:09,959
POC xerocon and other conferences and

80
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:15,570
you can find more about me through this

81
00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:19,019
slide and then we can start then what is

82
00:04:15,570 --> 00:04:22,409
power of X X here X X means chromosome

83
00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:25,680
of women so power of X X is the women

84
00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:27,360
initiative based in Korea and it was the

85
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:32,380
first better of

86
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:35,650
in the world throughout this event from

87
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:37,870
the previous time more remarkable and

88
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:40,508
talented women are expressing their

89
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:44,080
interest of cyber security field and it

90
00:04:40,509 --> 00:04:46,660
is gradually increasing so now it is not

91
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:51,880
a simple CTF it became one of the

92
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:54,479
community in Korea so then I will give

93
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:59,139
an introduction of power of xx briefly

94
00:04:54,479 --> 00:05:01,990
it is it was established in 2011 at a

95
00:04:59,139 --> 00:05:04,870
time when I was at cyber security club

96
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:07,419
which name assist in university I was

97
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:10,720
advised by POC security to run this

98
00:05:07,419 --> 00:05:15,698
event so that was the starting point of

99
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:20,949
power of xx and in in early 2010 there

100
00:05:15,699 --> 00:05:23,349
were few female cyber security club in

101
00:05:20,949 --> 00:05:26,710
Korea so this has taken the opportunity

102
00:05:23,349 --> 00:05:32,979
and broaden the prospects those are

103
00:05:26,710 --> 00:05:36,280
posters from 2011 to 18 and right side

104
00:05:32,979 --> 00:05:43,330
picture is the Japanese news when when I

105
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:45,369
organized the power of xxxx in 2011 for

106
00:05:43,330 --> 00:05:47,830
the operation in this real party style

107
00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:51,370
city ax and we have a qualification in

108
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:54,580
September or October Varna is organized

109
00:05:51,370 --> 00:05:56,740
in November during POC conference so

110
00:05:54,580 --> 00:06:01,120
power of exits is one of the biggest

111
00:05:56,740 --> 00:06:04,419
events held in our POC conference and

112
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:07,210
usually we have 8 more than 80 teams in

113
00:06:04,419 --> 00:06:09,698
average and no limitation in number of

114
00:06:07,210 --> 00:06:12,758
members or nationality to attend our

115
00:06:09,699 --> 00:06:16,120
qualification and only six to eight

116
00:06:12,759 --> 00:06:21,300
teams go to final and consist of five to

117
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:24,729
six members we have various teams from

118
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:28,060
high schools University clubs and

119
00:06:24,729 --> 00:06:31,690
researcher oriented so all participants

120
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:36,070
are aged from 10 to 30 or it is given to

121
00:06:31,690 --> 00:06:38,500
first to third places and until 2016 6

122
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:41,230
and hacker school which is one of the

123
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:45,400
community in Korea were running power of

124
00:06:41,230 --> 00:06:47,470
xxxx together and from 2017 till now sis

125
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:50,109
and diamond team which is one of the

126
00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:52,660
hacker team in Korea are running power

127
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:58,080
of xxxx together so those are pictures

128
00:06:52,660 --> 00:07:01,210
of them then why were you run this

129
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:03,820
before talking about this I want to talk

130
00:07:01,210 --> 00:07:07,180
about some barriers we found so the

131
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:10,000
first barrier women felt is that women

132
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:12,580
are underrepresented in this area so

133
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:15,430
there were lack of community for women

134
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:18,180
and also these are linked to lack of

135
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:20,140
female role models in this field may be

136
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:23,290
difficulties in learning could be

137
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:27,490
another reason but the most highlighted

138
00:07:23,290 --> 00:07:30,640
thing is that this area is supposed to

139
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:33,610
be male-dominated field so women are

140
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:37,750
just like hanging around them not the

141
00:07:33,610 --> 00:07:39,850
main part those are pictures of power of

142
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:42,910
X X and the luminary preliminary is one

143
00:07:39,850 --> 00:07:45,790
of one of the International CTF held in

144
00:07:42,910 --> 00:07:48,220
POC conference and as you can see in

145
00:07:45,790 --> 00:07:53,080
Pelham in our area all members are

146
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:59,140
mailed we can observe those things also

147
00:07:53,080 --> 00:08:01,180
in the research of ISACA in 2017 so all

148
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:04,450
those things make women get lose their

149
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:07,690
confidence and courageous so eventually

150
00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:12,400
lots of women gave up their career by

151
00:08:07,690 --> 00:08:15,760
the time they have chance to step up so

152
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:18,219
to cultivate women information security

153
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:21,010
researchers and hackers and to retain

154
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:23,380
women who already in this field we've

155
00:08:21,010 --> 00:08:26,919
established an active and sociable

156
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:30,750
networking community then why we started

157
00:08:26,919 --> 00:08:33,640
with CTF to get out of whim

158
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:38,469
male-dominated area and to increase

159
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:41,199
women's accessibility we felt CTF is one

160
00:08:38,469 --> 00:08:46,510
of the appropriate appropriate way so

161
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:49,510
that's why we started with CTF so in

162
00:08:46,510 --> 00:08:51,840
previous part time I found we found some

163
00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:54,240
barriers and to over

164
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:56,480
those we tried several things the first

165
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:59,720
one is interesting concept challenges

166
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:03,029
very interesting concept challenges like

167
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:06,180
using Morse code made system or treasure

168
00:09:03,029 --> 00:09:07,620
hunt card game and so on we could a we

169
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:11,459
were able to recruit more women

170
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:14,250
researchers all challenges have various

171
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:17,250
categories like programming system web

172
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:19,940
network forensic crypto maze concern and

173
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:23,640
we we tried to combine them with

174
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:25,800
interesting concepts or latest issues so

175
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:28,680
that we can so that we can treat our

176
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:31,400
more in women's interest and all

177
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:37,680
challenges are arranged over all level

178
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:41,939
from basic to advanced one we've tried

179
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:44,310
several years to make larger larger pool

180
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:47,130
of women researchers and to give them

181
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:50,579
more opportunities to build networks

182
00:09:47,130 --> 00:09:53,070
together you know building networks is

183
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:56,480
one of the important thing in this area

184
00:09:53,070 --> 00:10:00,000
so from two thousand eleven to fourteen

185
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:04,650
power of access winner team invited to

186
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:07,320
PhD CTF finally in Russia and in 2014 we

187
00:10:04,650 --> 00:10:12,120
invited a set of protocols teams in

188
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:14,700
Japan to final and in 2015 we invited

189
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:17,670
well-known hacker from approach as a

190
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:20,190
mentor we ran a mentor program for three

191
00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:22,140
to four hours he gave a small session

192
00:10:20,190 --> 00:10:25,770
about reverse engineering and Q&A

193
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:30,569
session for to give attendees a

194
00:10:25,770 --> 00:10:33,569
practical advices in 2017 we invited hit

195
00:10:30,570 --> 00:10:36,330
Congress in Taiwan to final and every

196
00:10:33,570 --> 00:10:39,720
year we provide some souvenirs to PR our

197
00:10:36,330 --> 00:10:41,820
event and community and of course we

198
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:43,709
invited whole teams to our networking

199
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:47,760
party so that they can communicate each

200
00:10:43,709 --> 00:10:52,949
other and have more opportunities to

201
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:55,140
meet up with famous researchers so those

202
00:10:52,950 --> 00:10:58,709
are the pictures of what I've said

203
00:10:55,140 --> 00:11:02,730
people in previous slide so left side is

204
00:10:58,709 --> 00:11:05,109
a pictures of 2011 so they invited to

205
00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:08,910
Rishikesh days if you have final

206
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:13,480
and in the middle those are pictures of

207
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:16,719
2012 and 2015's Mentor Program the last

208
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:21,880
one is the picture of 2017 so as you can

209
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:25,750
see we are growing up and thirdly we

210
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:29,320
repeat them to hacker teams through

211
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:29,920
through our CTF we found some talented

212
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:32,200
girls

213
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:35,800
so apparently diamond team which is the

214
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:40,060
team our company supported recruit them

215
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:42,729
as a team member so that so and then we

216
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:44,949
provide some opportunities to attend our

217
00:11:42,730 --> 00:11:49,750
technical conferences and training

218
00:11:44,950 --> 00:11:53,320
course they've managed to learn and

219
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:56,410
study on various subjects and/or we

220
00:11:53,320 --> 00:12:00,970
connected them to other hacking team so

221
00:11:56,410 --> 00:12:04,240
that they can study with new members so

222
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:06,459
impacts there are all our efforts or

223
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:10,089
more women hackers and researchers could

224
00:12:06,459 --> 00:12:13,268
be active so at the beginning we we have

225
00:12:10,089 --> 00:12:16,810
only about 30 people - who attend our

226
00:12:13,269 --> 00:12:21,220
CTF but now we have more than 80 teams

227
00:12:16,810 --> 00:12:25,239
in average and in recent years not only

228
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:27,820
domestic teams but also abroad teams are

229
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:28,779
increasing like from USA Japan and

230
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:31,480
Taiwan and so on

231
00:12:28,779 --> 00:12:34,720
and the winner of last year won in first

232
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:38,320
place at others domestic CTF which is

233
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:42,000
not women only satia actually she attend

234
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:45,070
attended that CTF as one member team and

235
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:47,230
now she is a member of demo demo team

236
00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:51,100
this was a really impressive thing for

237
00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:57,070
all of us and invitation to Russia

238
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:59,110
pitched a city city a final and inviting

239
00:12:57,070 --> 00:13:02,820
Japan and Taiwan team were a good

240
00:12:59,110 --> 00:13:07,750
opportunity for us to make our own

241
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:10,240
sustainable and stable community and mmm

242
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:12,850
especially for about Japan and Taiwan

243
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:15,850
team despite that we have different

244
00:13:12,850 --> 00:13:16,810
cultures and languages but we have one

245
00:13:15,850 --> 00:13:18,060
thing in common

246
00:13:16,810 --> 00:13:21,630
interesting hacking

247
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:26,060
so that was a turning point and made

248
00:13:21,630 --> 00:13:26,060
meaningful motivations for each other

249
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:33,449
so finally future plans Korea is the

250
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:37,469
first batter which have made women on a

251
00:13:33,450 --> 00:13:41,280
CTF and up and followed by Japan and

252
00:13:37,470 --> 00:13:44,280
Taiwan respectively so we feel really

253
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:48,540
thankful to thankful to them the way

254
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:52,439
they have made our sociable Asian women

255
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:57,780
cybersecurity community and nowadays I I

256
00:13:52,440 --> 00:14:00,090
heard some information that that other

257
00:13:57,780 --> 00:14:04,140
Asian countries are trying to cultivate

258
00:14:00,090 --> 00:14:06,600
women researchers and hackers in in

259
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:08,900
their country so hope our three

260
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:11,280
countries presentation could be a

261
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:15,150
starting point and be a great help to

262
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:17,459
them I think I believe we we can make

263
00:14:15,150 --> 00:14:21,240
more we can make our community more

264
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:25,760
influential and furthermore we can plan

265
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:25,760
ahead more significant things together

266
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:35,400
to make our concrete community so we are

267
00:14:31,770 --> 00:14:36,120
planning to hold following events in

268
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:38,490
near future

269
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:40,500
the first one is training course a

270
00:14:38,490 --> 00:14:44,370
training program for a whole aged women

271
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:46,950
in Korea and secondly organizing power

272
00:14:44,370 --> 00:14:49,530
of xx with various teams from all around

273
00:14:46,950 --> 00:14:55,080
the world so we want to make our CTF

274
00:14:49,530 --> 00:14:58,530
divers and and holding international

275
00:14:55,080 --> 00:15:00,480
competition with with invitation women

276
00:14:58,530 --> 00:15:04,380
hacker teams from all around the world

277
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:08,760
so I want to make this as a festival not

278
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:12,270
a simple CTF and lastly competition

279
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:14,520
cooperating with Illumina mmm is also

280
00:15:12,270 --> 00:15:19,560
another future plan so this could be

281
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:22,530
really cool so to move on to Japanese

282
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:25,770
women cybersecurity community I will

283
00:15:22,530 --> 00:15:27,930
pass mic to Asuka really thanks for a

284
00:15:25,770 --> 00:15:30,970
big opportunity to give an introduction

285
00:15:27,930 --> 00:15:33,550
of Korean women cybersecurity

286
00:15:30,970 --> 00:15:36,490
community and if you have any passion or

287
00:15:33,550 --> 00:15:38,969
have an awesome idea to relate it to our

288
00:15:36,490 --> 00:15:42,040
event or community please contact us by

289
00:15:38,970 --> 00:15:50,350
Facebook Twitter Email and so on so

290
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:53,620
really appreciate it so hi again I'm one

291
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:58,600
so now let's move on to the next story

292
00:15:53,620 --> 00:16:00,640
about Cydia for girls so see different

293
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:02,770
girls is the first female insect

294
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:06,939
community in Japan which was established

295
00:16:02,770 --> 00:16:10,870
in 2014 with support of second executive

296
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:14,440
committee so as you may know if you're a

297
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:18,160
city of player but Satcon is largest ETF

298
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:21,490
in Japan which the more than like 30

299
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:26,860
Japanese company our sponsor sponsoring

300
00:16:21,490 --> 00:16:31,240
such as like Fujitsu and NEC and with

301
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:34,480
those support and sponsors if I visible

302
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:40,480
I established a CTO for girls with about

303
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:45,610
10 female engineers and students so next

304
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:49,390
I would like to move on to why I see

305
00:16:45,610 --> 00:16:51,940
there for girls so based on my personal

306
00:16:49,390 --> 00:16:55,240
experience and opinions of my female

307
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:57,970
friends I felt that a lot of woman and

308
00:16:55,240 --> 00:17:01,570
feel like this like I really want to

309
00:16:57,970 --> 00:17:04,060
start learning in physics stuff but I

310
00:17:01,570 --> 00:17:07,300
don't know where to start and I don't

311
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:10,720
know who to ask about it and I know

312
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:12,669
there's a lot of workshops but to me it

313
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:15,430
is difficult to fit into those workshops

314
00:17:12,670 --> 00:17:20,410
because most of our participants are men

315
00:17:15,430 --> 00:17:23,380
and because most of the security

316
00:17:20,410 --> 00:17:26,740
engineers are men maybe in physics is

317
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:31,240
not for a woman and based on these

318
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:34,660
backgrounds I saw that one way to

319
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:37,120
breaking down these barriers is to make

320
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:41,550
a female and protect community and hold

321
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:41,550
a female Lisa TF workshop

322
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:49,080
so next I would like to introduce the

323
00:17:45,570 --> 00:17:51,149
activities of CTO for girls so there are

324
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:54,120
two main activities

325
00:17:51,149 --> 00:17:56,989
the first is woman only city of workshop

326
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:59,939
and second is women only see ya

327
00:17:56,990 --> 00:18:01,830
so in the next few slides I would like

328
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:07,919
to talk about the women only CDF

329
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:12,559
workshop so the first woman only city of

330
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:15,960
workshops was held in May 2014

331
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:18,690
what is interesting here is that before

332
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:22,139
we tell the first workshop we assume

333
00:18:18,690 --> 00:18:24,440
that only a few women will participate

334
00:18:22,139 --> 00:18:27,559
in our workshop

335
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:31,220
surprisingly in the end more than 70

336
00:18:27,559 --> 00:18:35,668
women participated in our workshop and

337
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:40,710
since then we hold to a workshop two to

338
00:18:35,669 --> 00:18:44,700
three times per year and up to now we

339
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:47,940
have held total 3 to 13 workshops and

340
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:56,340
more than 700 women have participated in

341
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:58,799
our workshop so Adam workshop we first

342
00:18:56,340 --> 00:19:01,649
give 40-minute lecture related to the

343
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:04,408
computer security such as minor analysis

344
00:19:01,649 --> 00:19:09,389
forensics in crypto and web and network

345
00:19:04,409 --> 00:19:12,330
security and after that brief lecture we

346
00:19:09,389 --> 00:19:15,080
provide CTF challenges which are related

347
00:19:12,330 --> 00:19:21,418
to the lecture and pull the minis idioms

348
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:24,510
and the point here is that when in the

349
00:19:21,419 --> 00:19:27,539
lecture we teach from the basics of

350
00:19:24,510 --> 00:19:30,570
computer science for example when we

351
00:19:27,539 --> 00:19:33,510
teach about like minor analysis we start

352
00:19:30,570 --> 00:19:36,658
from what is hexadecimal and what is

353
00:19:33,510 --> 00:19:41,309
Windows API and what are resistor and

354
00:19:36,659 --> 00:19:45,059
memory and assembly and furthermore we

355
00:19:41,309 --> 00:19:47,490
teach how to use a debugger and for the

356
00:19:45,059 --> 00:19:50,480
other fear field such as like forensic

357
00:19:47,490 --> 00:19:55,159
crypto and web security network analysis

358
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:55,159
we also start from the basics

359
00:19:56,050 --> 00:20:03,490
so next I would like to move on to what

360
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:07,660
kind of people are participating in our

361
00:20:03,490 --> 00:20:10,750
workshop so based on our survey one

362
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:14,280
interesting thing we found is that most

363
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:16,600
participants are in their 20s or 30s and

364
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:20,080
unfortunately there are still only a few

365
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:24,730
students and we assume that this is

366
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:28,600
because like there are only as you still

367
00:20:24,730 --> 00:20:33,040
only a few schools focusing focus on

368
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:36,040
teaching information security and in

369
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:39,040
addition most of the participants start

370
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:42,430
learning info tech stuff after they are

371
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:47,500
employed as engineers or other

372
00:20:42,430 --> 00:20:50,530
information security related jobs so

373
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:52,810
thus for them teacher for growth

374
00:20:50,530 --> 00:20:59,020
workshop our seems to be a good starting

375
00:20:52,810 --> 00:21:02,230
point so next I would like to talk about

376
00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:09,070
what we focus on in order to provide a

377
00:21:02,230 --> 00:21:11,530
good workshop so just first of all to

378
00:21:09,070 --> 00:21:13,990
support beginners we provide a virtual

379
00:21:11,530 --> 00:21:17,889
machine which all of the related tools

380
00:21:13,990 --> 00:21:20,350
are already installed and moreover we

381
00:21:17,890 --> 00:21:25,420
provide a manual to install the virtual

382
00:21:20,350 --> 00:21:28,000
machine and also during the workshop our

383
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:31,290
staff members answer the question for

384
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:34,390
the participant as soon as possible and

385
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:37,300
we also provide CTF challenges from

386
00:21:34,390 --> 00:21:41,280
basic to advanced level so that everyone

387
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:44,560
can enjoy the workshop and we also

388
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:47,800
sometimes regulate media and taking

389
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:49,419
photos because some participants don't

390
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:55,090
want their pictures posted on the

391
00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:57,610
internet so these are the photos taking

392
00:21:55,090 --> 00:22:01,540
at a workshop and you can see that a

393
00:21:57,610 --> 00:22:06,639
participant are listening to the lecture

394
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:09,940
earnestly so so far I'll talk about the

395
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:11,710
women only get workshop so next

396
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:15,279
I would like to talk about the women

397
00:22:11,710 --> 00:22:20,470
only CDF that we call ghost in the

398
00:22:15,279 --> 00:22:24,519
shell' CTF so here I will start with

399
00:22:20,470 --> 00:22:26,500
what is ghost in the shell' so ghost in

400
00:22:24,519 --> 00:22:28,509
the shell is a famous Japanese science

401
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:31,269
fiction comic that was originally

402
00:22:28,509 --> 00:22:35,460
written by shoroma Sam Union and was

403
00:22:31,269 --> 00:22:40,539
made into a Hollywood movie in 2017 so

404
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:44,230
from 2015 to 2017 we collaborated with

405
00:22:40,539 --> 00:22:51,129
this ghost in the shell and tell women

406
00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:57,850
only see the app and the this CTF has

407
00:22:51,129 --> 00:23:00,759
been held three times and the in the

408
00:22:57,850 --> 00:23:04,269
form of the individual Japanese are

409
00:23:00,759 --> 00:23:07,720
Syria and the third goes in the shell

410
00:23:04,269 --> 00:23:11,980
CDF was held as an international

411
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:14,950
competition in Tokyo and the winner of

412
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:24,549
the third CTF was a security researcher

413
00:23:14,950 --> 00:23:27,279
from PPP so next thing I want to talk

414
00:23:24,549 --> 00:23:31,450
about is the CTF visualization system in

415
00:23:27,279 --> 00:23:34,080
the ghost in Chelsea here so CTF

416
00:23:31,450 --> 00:23:36,600
visualization system is one interesting

417
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:40,689
characteristic in the coastal self idea

418
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:45,580
so we call this PDF visualization system

419
00:23:40,690 --> 00:23:48,370
as amateurs zero so amateurs zero stands

420
00:23:45,580 --> 00:23:50,350
for and that's multi actor tactical

421
00:23:48,370 --> 00:23:53,799
exercise real-time analysis system

422
00:23:50,350 --> 00:23:56,678
prototype version zero and this PDF

423
00:23:53,799 --> 00:23:59,860
visualization system was developed by an

424
00:23:56,679 --> 00:24:01,840
ICT the National Institute of

425
00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:07,508
information and communication technology

426
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:10,029
in Japan the image on the slide shows

427
00:24:07,509 --> 00:24:13,240
the city of visualization system which

428
00:24:10,029 --> 00:24:17,409
are showing the CTF players and the

429
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:21,399
challenges the booth circle representing

430
00:24:17,409 --> 00:24:23,470
Phil crow represents the CTF player and

431
00:24:21,399 --> 00:24:30,370
each arm Soaker

432
00:24:23,470 --> 00:24:33,639
represent the PDF challenges and also

433
00:24:30,370 --> 00:24:39,729
this PDF visualization system can show

434
00:24:33,639 --> 00:24:44,340
the details of all CDF challenges so

435
00:24:39,730 --> 00:24:47,889
next I would like to talk about how we

436
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:52,240
connected the woman in the InfoSec field

437
00:24:47,889 --> 00:24:55,178
to build the community so first thing we

438
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:57,450
did was visualize the community to gain

439
00:24:55,179 --> 00:25:00,429
recognition from your woman and

440
00:24:57,450 --> 00:25:05,950
encourage women to participate in our

441
00:25:00,429 --> 00:25:07,840
workshop so for example we created an

442
00:25:05,950 --> 00:25:10,600
offshore website and social media

443
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:14,649
accounts and reported the activities

444
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:18,129
regularly and we also created a logo

445
00:25:14,649 --> 00:25:22,299
sticker and t-shirts and we also invited

446
00:25:18,129 --> 00:25:25,139
media like newspapers magazine and web

447
00:25:22,299 --> 00:25:28,539
media and took a lot of entries and we

448
00:25:25,139 --> 00:25:31,090
also collaborated with a famous events

449
00:25:28,539 --> 00:25:37,389
and content such as code blue and go to

450
00:25:31,090 --> 00:25:41,049
the shelf so next thing we did to

451
00:25:37,389 --> 00:25:45,299
connect the woman it was actively

452
00:25:41,049 --> 00:25:48,070
facilitate networking so for example

453
00:25:45,299 --> 00:25:50,740
during the break for the workshop we

454
00:25:48,070 --> 00:25:53,939
provide cues snacks such as donuts

455
00:25:50,740 --> 00:25:58,299
macarons cup cakes and puddings and

456
00:25:53,940 --> 00:26:00,370
mainly these two snacks are used to open

457
00:25:58,299 --> 00:26:03,850
the conversation between the

458
00:26:00,370 --> 00:26:06,449
participants like for example like oh

459
00:26:03,850 --> 00:26:10,480
this is really really cute sweet and

460
00:26:06,450 --> 00:26:12,159
sweet and yes I totally agree with that

461
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:14,440
does it really this is really really

462
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:17,070
cute and we are you from

463
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:21,899
so like that kind of conversations

464
00:26:17,070 --> 00:26:25,450
starts between the participants and

465
00:26:21,899 --> 00:26:28,779
furthermore to facility networking we

466
00:26:25,450 --> 00:26:31,269
hold in an after party so easily about

467
00:26:28,779 --> 00:26:34,720
10 to 40% of the participant also

468
00:26:31,269 --> 00:26:36,500
participates the after party so that's

469
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:40,970
how we feel

470
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:44,030
the networking next I will let's talk

471
00:26:40,970 --> 00:26:48,250
about how we build a sustainable

472
00:26:44,030 --> 00:26:52,790
community so first thing we did is was

473
00:26:48,250 --> 00:26:55,010
we actively recruit new members in the

474
00:26:52,790 --> 00:26:56,920
early sees of a city of for grills we

475
00:26:55,010 --> 00:26:59,870
asked existing local community members

476
00:26:56,920 --> 00:27:01,730
including second members whether they

477
00:26:59,870 --> 00:27:05,600
know women who are interested in city

478
00:27:01,730 --> 00:27:09,560
for girls activities and if there was

479
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:14,449
research woman we contact them directly

480
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:16,399
so that's the early stage and now we

481
00:27:14,450 --> 00:27:20,180
recruit new members from the workshop

482
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:26,420
participants and as a result number of

483
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:29,420
members is currently about 30 so next

484
00:27:26,420 --> 00:27:32,990
thing we did to build the sustainable

485
00:27:29,420 --> 00:27:36,910
community was we created an organization

486
00:27:32,990 --> 00:27:40,220
that does not rely on a single person

487
00:27:36,910 --> 00:27:42,710
for example we created a manual such as

488
00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:45,760
like how to create city of challenges

489
00:27:42,710 --> 00:27:48,590
and how to hold workshops and

490
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:53,030
furthermore we hand over power to the

491
00:27:48,590 --> 00:27:56,629
young members and as a leader I'm

492
00:27:53,030 --> 00:28:00,879
confident that even I the leader can be

493
00:27:56,630 --> 00:28:00,880
able to paste replaced by another member

494
00:28:01,540 --> 00:28:06,680
so lastly I would like to acknowledge

495
00:28:04,190 --> 00:28:10,040
all the city for gross members and the

496
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:14,240
fedcon members and also our sponsors for

497
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:15,860
their dedicated support and for more

498
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:19,070

Sikh community for woman over our member

512
00:28:58,090 --> 00:29:06,699
are female as a beginning I wanted to

513
00:29:01,750 --> 00:29:10,950
talk about how we start our story in

514
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:14,649
2014 they were Philco holy war Shikoku

515
00:29:10,950 --> 00:29:21,279
after the war shot in December we feel

516
00:29:14,649 --> 00:29:23,949
it's a pity to T silver listing so we

517
00:29:21,279 --> 00:29:28,720
start thinking what we want to be big

518
00:29:23,950 --> 00:29:31,539
cultures from this workshop our biggest

519
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:34,470
er obstacle is we don't have enough

520
00:29:31,539 --> 00:29:37,840
ability to host a workshop by ourselves

521
00:29:34,470 --> 00:29:40,019
the speaker overall shop come from

522
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:44,350
outside nom nom

523
00:29:40,019 --> 00:29:47,620
not by ourselves after our discussion we

524
00:29:44,350 --> 00:29:51,549
decided to establish a study group for

525
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:55,209
girls and then also he can close our

526
00:29:51,549 --> 00:30:01,029
first tab is to improve our information

527
00:29:55,210 --> 00:30:04,600
security in terminology any other hence

528
00:30:01,029 --> 00:30:08,409
we file is enhance the internal cohesion

529
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:11,860
in he conquers more is important of all

530
00:30:08,409 --> 00:30:16,600
we can help more more girl children in

531
00:30:11,860 --> 00:30:19,779
foster community in the future so we

532
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:21,939
have two preference the first one is we

533
00:30:19,779 --> 00:30:26,350
believe everyone can learn info sector

534
00:30:21,940 --> 00:30:29,019
whether you are trial a why should we in

535
00:30:26,350 --> 00:30:32,350
Versailles sleeves because in Taiwan

536
00:30:29,019 --> 00:30:35,710
there are very few girls who say not my

537
00:30:32,350 --> 00:30:40,029
interest is info sick or I want to

538
00:30:35,710 --> 00:30:45,070
InfoSec job in the future those idea are

539
00:30:40,029 --> 00:30:47,070
now are not an option for them we want

540
00:30:45,070 --> 00:30:52,928
to increase this Passport

541
00:30:47,070 --> 00:30:54,850
so if you want to do this we must share

542
00:30:52,929 --> 00:30:58,779
knowledge and then then

543
00:30:54,850 --> 00:31:02,080
enough linear results and the share a

544
00:30:58,779 --> 00:31:06,159
message she Santos can do it other girl

545
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:06,730
can do it as well in order to do those

546
00:31:06,159 --> 00:31:09,880
things

547
00:31:06,730 --> 00:31:12,370
our second purpose is teen girls who are

548
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:17,110
interested in InfoSec learning and going

549
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:20,379
together so our course I improved our

550
00:31:17,110 --> 00:31:23,379
members ability and maintain his uncle's

551
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:23,860
organization so we divided into two

552
00:31:23,380 --> 00:31:26,049
groups

553
00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:32,740
but I'm instead of group in the study

554
00:31:26,049 --> 00:31:35,860
group study group is essential of his

555
00:31:32,740 --> 00:31:38,860
uncles we divided his understudy curve

556
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:43,090
into several teams each team has their

557
00:31:38,860 --> 00:31:46,360
own research topic study cool half a

558
00:31:43,090 --> 00:31:49,918
meter once a month and each team take

559
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:53,350
turns sharing their researchers also

560
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:56,649
statical will give technical support

561
00:31:53,350 --> 00:32:03,399
when we have rhinology Neruda sharing

562
00:31:56,649 --> 00:32:07,120
events then we need we also need some

563
00:32:03,399 --> 00:32:11,018
member to miniature our community and

564
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:12,250
host event a diminished rated group like

565
00:32:11,019 --> 00:32:14,620
our baby sister

566
00:32:12,250 --> 00:32:18,399
they will take they were taking care of

567
00:32:14,620 --> 00:32:22,110
everything then study cool folks out

568
00:32:18,399 --> 00:32:26,559
there folks on their domain knowledge

569
00:32:22,110 --> 00:32:30,029
for instance our administrative group

570
00:32:26,559 --> 00:32:33,279
will arrange a meet every three months

571
00:32:30,029 --> 00:32:37,080
the meeting usually including check-in

572
00:32:33,279 --> 00:32:42,519
the current situation of study group and

573
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:46,178
planning the coming event second they

574
00:32:42,519 --> 00:32:49,960
also had a lot of social media to share

575
00:32:46,179 --> 00:32:54,129
knowledge and the protest message in the

576
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:56,860
last panelist they will say I'm a leader

577
00:32:54,129 --> 00:32:59,080
in action every year because we believe

578
00:32:56,860 --> 00:33:03,928
everyone can be a leader of vision goals

579
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:03,928
and their community belongs to everyone

580
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:08,350
there are three types of even wish we

581
00:33:07,570 --> 00:33:11,470
had hope

582
00:33:08,350 --> 00:33:14,379
for first the eva means the bigger one

583
00:33:11,470 --> 00:33:18,669
and open to public for example an

584
00:33:14,380 --> 00:33:22,539
activity in iit-b in amsterdam or the

585
00:33:18,669 --> 00:33:25,480
city of in 2019 second the knowledge

586
00:33:22,539 --> 00:33:28,179
sharing means we want to share our

587
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:32,140
knowledge by ourselves

588
00:33:28,179 --> 00:33:35,169
it's always the hope I static group the

589
00:33:32,140 --> 00:33:38,950
Shirin imitation is the most important

590
00:33:35,169 --> 00:33:41,320
event now we are really appreciate many

591
00:33:38,950 --> 00:33:45,000
people are willing to come and give and

592
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:50,110
give us encouragement and ensure their

593
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:53,710
experience to us every event have

594
00:33:50,110 --> 00:34:01,539
different meaning to us so we will talk

595
00:33:53,710 --> 00:34:04,120
about our story by loss event in 2014

596
00:34:01,539 --> 00:34:07,330
this today was shot for girls it's not

597
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:11,049
high we don't have enough ability to

598
00:34:07,330 --> 00:34:18,909
host a workshop by ourselves so we build

599
00:34:11,050 --> 00:34:24,639
a study group after running one year of

600
00:34:18,909 --> 00:34:31,300
study group we we publish our our

601
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:33,520
research we saw in this event this event

602
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:36,730
is natural everyone hope who we are

603
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:41,699
instead of sharing a message chicken

604
00:34:36,730 --> 00:34:46,629
girls can do it and we are working on it

605
00:34:41,699 --> 00:34:48,969
after the event we have a lot of new

606
00:34:46,629 --> 00:34:53,259
clothes join us this is a chicken toes

607
00:34:48,969 --> 00:34:56,049
anniversary it's luck that tv's member

608
00:34:53,260 --> 00:34:59,290
came to taiwan that year they also

609
00:34:56,050 --> 00:35:03,130
accept our invitation for you generosity

610
00:34:59,290 --> 00:35:10,060
and share with us how interesting info

611
00:35:03,130 --> 00:35:14,680
SEC is by their will experiment wasn't

612
00:35:10,060 --> 00:35:18,369
16 we invite three outstanding woman to

613
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:21,609
in Evo second company CEO and one

614
00:35:18,369 --> 00:35:24,730
Cameron's founder to show us

615
00:35:21,610 --> 00:35:32,650
no female is possible to be outstanding

616
00:35:24,730 --> 00:35:36,150
in the security field and this is a

617
00:35:32,650 --> 00:35:39,790
teenager summer camp to teach the Pascal

618
00:35:36,150 --> 00:35:43,390
Council of information security the code

619
00:35:39,790 --> 00:35:46,930
in our province we believe everyone can

620
00:35:43,390 --> 00:35:49,839
learn in vozack so sharing knowledge is

621
00:35:46,930 --> 00:35:50,470
not only for adult but also for

622
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:54,520
teenagers

623
00:35:50,470 --> 00:35:58,060
so we transfer our knowledge to an

624
00:35:54,520 --> 00:36:05,950
easily understand language we also have

625
00:35:58,060 --> 00:36:08,860
to narrow down during age every year we

626
00:36:05,950 --> 00:36:11,379
work harder and do better and hope that

627
00:36:08,860 --> 00:36:15,100
we can make the community a little

628
00:36:11,380 --> 00:36:19,510
different so each year we invite a pob

629
00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:23,080
member and the chemical researchers come

630
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:26,590
to share with us they sure how special a

631
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:30,730
walk of the InfoSec is from this year

632
00:36:26,590 --> 00:36:36,010
some of our members graduate and accad a

633
00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:39,250
drop-in InfoSec field so actually this

634
00:36:36,010 --> 00:36:42,010
year is heating cost nightmare we have

635
00:36:39,250 --> 00:36:45,270
encountered this pending

636
00:36:42,010 --> 00:36:49,740
lack of ability and the member roots

637
00:36:45,270 --> 00:36:53,470
seriously those they were really tough

638
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:57,160
but we still have some member some

639
00:36:53,470 --> 00:37:00,399
members and well organiser community to

640
00:36:57,160 --> 00:37:03,129
hold the most technical info State

641
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:05,530
Conference in Taiwan now heckles in

642
00:37:03,130 --> 00:37:07,630

and over 1,000 attended this not only

645
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:19,150
acquired innovative ear but also the

646
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:25,810
first year the organizers are all female

647
00:37:19,150 --> 00:37:29,350
also they are his uncles member and in

648
00:37:25,810 --> 00:37:33,730
this year his ankles have grown strong

649
00:37:29,350 --> 00:37:37,779
enough we host our wall CDF

650
00:37:33,730 --> 00:37:40,570
which is our minion stone by this year

651
00:37:37,780 --> 00:37:44,950
we finally have repeatedly to decide our

652
00:37:40,570 --> 00:37:48,040
own task in the community become more

653
00:37:44,950 --> 00:37:53,710
stable because there are more problem to

654

join us and this is our first time to do

655

watch the video and then read the

667
00:38:38,859 --> 00:38:45,970
article so we decided to post a process

668
00:38:43,210 --> 00:38:50,020
T key in the introduce oversee

669
00:38:45,970 --> 00:38:53,169
conference in this way also is take more

670
00:38:50,020 --> 00:38:56,410
time to prepare the sharing step by

671

intelligent commonly to trousers that

676

and try to be better till now what I

678
00:39:24,430 --> 00:39:33,759
want to say is that we have experienced

679
00:39:27,850 --> 00:39:37,868
many stab setbacks and try try it along

680
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:41,770
the way but we have never forgotten our

681
00:39:37,869 --> 00:39:43,090
own profits we believe everyone can

682
00:39:41,770 --> 00:39:47,000

713
00:42:01,020 --> 00:42:05,940
current status in activities of three

714

722
00:42:28,590 --> 00:42:34,290
our theory community communities reveals

723
00:42:32,100 --> 00:42:36,779
some of the factors that are important

724
00:42:34,290 --> 00:42:39,870

728
00:42:45,870 --> 00:42:52,609
