it easier for the rest of us to ignore

16
00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:42,620
the ringing while you wait for your

17

voicemail to pick it up Pablo and David

18
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:48,870
thanks everybody for coming out again

19
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:50,969
welcome to hang hacking 10 million

20
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:53,550
useful idiots online propaganda is a

21
00:00:50,969 --> 00:00:54,930
socio-technical security project I'll

22
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:57,419
ask that if you tweet about this that

23
00:00:54,930 --> 00:01:00,660
you please use the hashtag hack 10

24
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:03,359
million I'm Pablo Brewer and I'm David

25
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:06,240
Perlman and why don't we get started by

26
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:08,340
having David tell you a little story so

27
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:10,439
imagine that your seaso at a large

28
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:12,000
American base international manufacturer

29
00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:14,210
of internet scale networking and

30
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,530
communications projects products

31
00:01:14,210 --> 00:01:18,270
customer asks you to investigate some

32
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:19,890
unusual errors and in the process of

33
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:21,539
looking into it you find a highly

34
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:24,840
suspicious Hardware backdoor in an

35
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:26,549
overseas competitors products you have

36
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:29,430
some talks with your legal team and you

37
00:01:26,549 --> 00:01:31,950
decide to go through the National cert

38
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:34,140
instead of talking to the competitor you

39
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:35,340
do your responsible disclosure you feel

40
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:37,619
good you've done the right thing you're

41
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:39,720
starting to talk to your team about what

42
00:01:37,619 --> 00:01:43,079
to tell your your customers to do about

43
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:44,789
the problem a few days later you wake up

44
00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:46,500
one morning and there are hundreds of

45
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:48,689
messages waiting for you everybody's

46
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:52,829
talking about a highly realistic video

47
00:01:48,689 --> 00:01:54,508
of you talking about how important it is

48
00:01:52,829 --> 00:01:56,699
for American manufacturers to work

49
00:01:54,509 --> 00:01:59,219
closely with the NSA and provide

50
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:01,409
hardware backdoors in their products you

51
00:01:59,219 --> 00:02:06,899
are shocked you would never say such a

52
00:02:01,409 --> 00:02:09,330
thing the video is completely fake but

53
00:02:06,899 --> 00:02:10,560
at the same time that lending credence

54
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:12,300
to the rumors

55
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:14,280
there's reports of a vulnerability in

56
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:15,510
your own software it's minor it doesn't

57
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:17,099
really have anything to do with it but

58
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:18,750
it's adding to the media narrative and

59
00:02:17,099 --> 00:02:22,049
people are starting to believe what's

60
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:23,489
going on so you call your crisis

61
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:27,120
management team you have some

62
00:02:23,489 --> 00:02:28,980
conversations about spin control you

63
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:30,480
debunk the fake video but as soon as you

64
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:32,310
debunk it another one pops up with your

65
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:34,920
CEO and then another one pops up with

66
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:36,209
this with the head of the NSA the videos

67
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:38,700
are popping up fast and you can play

68
00:02:36,209 --> 00:02:39,810
whack-a-mole it's a disaster it's

69
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:41,730
totally out of control

70
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:43,440
it's an unstoppable trend on social

71
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:45,660
media your crisis management team says

72
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:47,370
that it's being boosted by botnets you

73
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:51,709
talk to the social network companies but

74
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:51,709
they don't even answer their phones so

75
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:56,400
you release a patch but no one even

76
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:58,680
notices with all the noise going on a

77
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:01,430
debate is raging among the experts all

78
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:05,099
of these experts have suspiciously

79
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:07,290
awkward English diction it's a lopsided

80
00:03:05,099 --> 00:03:08,579
debate and the position that you're the

81
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:12,060
one with the hardware backdoors is

82
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:13,410
winning you even though you've released

83
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:15,030
the patch everybody's saying maybe this

84
00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:19,709
is just the tip of the iceberg of your

85
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:24,930
work with the NSA no one's even talking

86
00:03:19,709 --> 00:03:28,079
about the competitor so gradually the

87
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:29,549
news cycle moves on you once things have

88
00:03:28,079 --> 00:03:31,170
quieted down a bit you try to bring up

89
00:03:29,549 --> 00:03:32,940
the backdoor again but everybody says

90
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:34,858
it's just sour grapes and your PR team

91
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:36,569
tells you look don't even try to talk

92
00:03:34,859 --> 00:03:37,680
about this you just we just want

93
00:03:36,569 --> 00:03:40,078
everyone to forget about this whole

94
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:41,579
thing and let the stock recover the

95
00:03:40,079 --> 00:03:44,519
stock is starting to recover a little

96
00:03:41,579 --> 00:03:47,850
bit you're kind of relieved hopefully

97
00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:50,190
things are over you can rest again now

98
00:03:47,850 --> 00:03:52,230
one day a few weeks later you're walking

99
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:56,040
down the street and suddenly you're

100
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:57,750
accosted by a crazy man who's ranting

101
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:59,819
about your involvement in sinister

102
00:03:57,750 --> 00:04:01,530
conspiracies he pulled out a gun and

103
00:03:59,819 --> 00:04:03,298
says he's making a citizen's arrest

104
00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:04,980
because of your involvement in these

105
00:04:03,299 --> 00:04:07,319
crimes against the American people and

106
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:09,690
the people of the world you shout for

107
00:04:07,319 --> 00:04:11,638
help he grabs you there's a struggle the

108
00:04:09,690 --> 00:04:14,609
police come a gun goes off the police

109
00:04:11,639 --> 00:04:15,450
take him down and you're you're okay

110
00:04:14,609 --> 00:04:18,269
you're fine

111
00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:20,430
but now the rumors about your company

112
00:04:18,269 --> 00:04:22,380
are back in the news with a sinister new

113
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:24,000
twist which is that some people are

114
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:27,389
starting to say that maybe

115
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,099
this guy was actually a hero and you had

116
00:04:27,389 --> 00:04:32,879
him killed to protect your deep state

117
00:04:29,099 --> 00:04:34,830
conspiracy with the NSA now the

118
00:04:32,879 --> 00:04:36,419
legitimate news initially sticks to the

119
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:38,639
facts they're not gonna go with anything

120
00:04:36,419 --> 00:04:40,650
that crazy but a few politicians and

121
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:43,199
world leaders pick up on the conspiracy

122
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:46,438
theories and then eventually a

123
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:48,990
legitimate news outlet quotes one of

124
00:04:46,439 --> 00:04:51,000
these leaders just quoting them without

125
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:52,409
correcting them and then before you know

126
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,169
it the legitimate news pundits are

127
00:04:52,409 --> 00:04:57,270
talking about these crazy outlandish

128
00:04:55,169 --> 00:04:59,310
conspiracy theories about your company

129
00:04:57,270 --> 00:05:01,500
as if they might be true somehow it's

130
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:03,000
made it onto the mainstream news when

131
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:06,180
there was never anything there in the

132
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:08,250
first place a few nights later you wake

133
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:10,139
up to an emergency call three of your

134
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:14,159
overseas offices are in the midst of

135
00:05:10,139 --> 00:05:15,900
protests by angry violent mobs the local

136
00:05:14,159 --> 00:05:17,610
police don't even seem to be trying very

137
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:18,929
hard and when you look closely on the

138
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:21,750
videos you see that some of the police

139
00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:23,879
are wearing pins and armbands that have

140
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:25,740
the same symbols that as the protesters

141
00:05:23,879 --> 00:05:27,240
and you recognize these symbols from

142
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:28,949
some of the online conspiracy

143
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:32,400
communities that you've started to be

144
00:05:28,949 --> 00:05:34,800
familiar with the next morning one of

145
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:36,690
the leaders who had been quoting the

146
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:38,039
conspiracy theories announces that

147
00:05:36,690 --> 00:05:39,330
they're not even going to let you do

148
00:05:38,039 --> 00:05:41,818
business in their country anymore

149
00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:43,800
the a week later that you parliament

150
00:05:41,819 --> 00:05:46,050
starts saying that they're gonna have to

151
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:48,960
have some conversations about the

152
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:51,210
credible rumors of your allowing the NSA

153
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:53,310
to put backdoors in your products they

154
00:05:51,210 --> 00:05:56,789
begin a surreal debate of your imaginary

155
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:58,349
crimes your stock is tanking the board

156
00:05:56,789 --> 00:06:00,210
gives your CEO the boot it's an

157
00:05:58,349 --> 00:06:01,409
unmitigated disaster and there's nothing

158
00:06:00,210 --> 00:06:05,430
you can do while you're waiting for the

159
00:06:01,409 --> 00:06:07,438
EU to come to a conclusion now as a

160
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:09,449
cyber security professional you did

161
00:06:07,439 --> 00:06:11,779
everything completely right but somehow

162
00:06:09,449 --> 00:06:14,580
it all went horribly horribly wrong

163
00:06:11,779 --> 00:06:17,669
nobody's even talking about the backdoor

164
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:19,169
that you initially found the competitors

165
00:06:17,669 --> 00:06:20,729
the bad guys they got away with it

166
00:06:19,169 --> 00:06:21,930
completely they're off scot-free no

167
00:06:20,729 --> 00:06:24,000
one's even talking about that anymore

168
00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:25,919
and your own company has been damaged

169
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,889
far worse than any conventional cyber

170
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:30,299
attack you've ever seen

171
00:06:27,889 --> 00:06:31,889
now all this might sound far-fetched but

172
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:33,690
every single piece of the story that I

173
00:06:31,889 --> 00:06:34,880
just told you has already happened in

174
00:06:33,690 --> 00:06:36,750
real life

175
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:38,550
fake video

176
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:40,710
is a powerful tool to manipulate the

177
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:43,020
news in fact a number of talks here have

178
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:46,260
been talking about the power of fake

179
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:48,390
video deep fakes social networks have

180
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:51,450
already profoundly affected markets and

181
00:06:48,390 --> 00:06:53,250
they're routinely used to intentionally

182
00:06:51,450 --> 00:06:56,640
manipulate markets not just to affect

183
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:58,410
them indirectly conspiracy theories now

184
00:06:56,640 --> 00:07:00,870
conspiracy theories is a big part of

185
00:06:58,410 --> 00:07:03,150
this they thrive online and they have

186
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:04,980
widely convinced large sections of the

187
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:07,020
normal people population to believe

188
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:11,570
things that are completely ridiculous

189
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:14,099
and totally disregard obvious truths in

190
00:07:11,570 --> 00:07:16,590
fact conspiracy theories have inspired

191
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:21,900
real-world violence riots and even mass

192
00:07:16,590 --> 00:07:24,060
murder and malicious actors have already

193
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:26,340
been documented to be manipulating and

194
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:29,250
even creating from scratch

195
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:30,659
conspiracy theories for their own

196
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:34,080
nefarious purposes which have then

197
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:36,150
thrived the only part of the story that

198
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:37,680
hasn't happened yet is for all of these

199
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:39,479
pieces to be put together in a

200
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:41,940
coordinated campaign with a corporate

201
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:44,669
target but our colleagues in the MIS

202
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:47,100
InfoSec working group we've developed

203
00:07:44,669 --> 00:07:50,849
frameworks for analyzing these campaigns

204
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:52,229
in a formal way and it's clear that it's

205
00:07:50,850 --> 00:07:54,570
only a matter of time before this makes

206
00:07:52,229 --> 00:07:55,830
a jump to the corporate space now at

207
00:07:54,570 --> 00:07:57,570
this point some of you are looking at

208
00:07:55,830 --> 00:08:00,229
this and thinking sure but this is a PR

209
00:07:57,570 --> 00:08:02,909
or a marketing problem it's not a

210
00:08:00,229 --> 00:08:04,530
cybersecurity problem so to answer that

211
00:08:02,910 --> 00:08:06,630
we're gonna introduce the concept of

212
00:08:04,530 --> 00:08:09,030
socio technical systems and show you

213
00:08:06,630 --> 00:08:13,979
what it means to hack a socio technical

214
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:16,320
system so that now that David has given

215
00:08:13,979 --> 00:08:17,609
us this little horrifying story how are

216
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:18,990
we gonna fix this first we're going to

217
00:08:17,610 --> 00:08:20,490
start out by talking a little bit about

218
00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:22,350
the brief history of information and

219
00:08:20,490 --> 00:08:24,450
transmission we'll talk a little bit

220
00:08:22,350 --> 00:08:26,010
about the instruments of influence will

221
00:08:24,450 --> 00:08:28,469
talk about the mechanisms of influence

222
00:08:26,010 --> 00:08:30,300
we'll explain what a socio technical

223
00:08:28,470 --> 00:08:32,610
system is and then we'll talk about

224
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:34,169
defense mitigation and what we could be

225
00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:37,620
doing as we go forward to address these

226
00:08:34,169 --> 00:08:39,659
issues so first let's talk up a little

227
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:41,789
bit about transmission of information I

228
00:08:39,659 --> 00:08:43,710
love this quote from CS Lewis isn't it

229
00:08:41,789 --> 00:08:45,510
how funny how a day-to-day nothing

230
00:08:43,710 --> 00:08:47,160
changes but you look back and everything

231
00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:50,260
is different that is very applicable to

232
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:52,959
this case what happened B

233
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:54,430
Queen the last presidential election and

234
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:57,970
the one before that why are we just

235
00:08:54,430 --> 00:08:59,680
talking about these things now so

236
00:08:57,970 --> 00:09:02,380
misinformation has been around forever

237
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:04,870
ramses ii used misinformation he put

238
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:07,030
hieroglyphics on a wall that were

239
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:08,620
intended to frighten the enemies these

240
00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:10,120
messages didn't get transmitted anywhere

241
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:14,860
you had to know where the message was

242
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:17,020
and you had to go to the message so we

243
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:19,060
want to get that message to transmit so

244
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:22,120
the next kind of revolution next

245
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:25,270
evolution there is books and parchment

246
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:28,330
now literacy is not common parchment is

247
00:09:25,270 --> 00:09:29,920
expensive ink is expensive and so really

248
00:09:28,330 --> 00:09:32,350
unless you were the nation-state or a

249
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:34,060
church you really weren't transmitting a

250
00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:36,760
whole lot of messages it was time

251
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:38,500
intensive it was resource intensive and

252
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:43,720
the message could only be transmitted as

253
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:45,850
far as a person could carry it so around

254
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:48,070
1440 we get movable type and the

255
00:09:45,850 --> 00:09:50,020
Gutenberg press and this is the first

256
00:09:48,070 --> 00:09:51,190
time that technology substantially

257
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:54,069
affects the way that we're able to

258
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:56,260
transmit messages for the first time the

259
00:09:54,070 --> 00:09:59,290
limited number of entities that can

260
00:09:56,260 --> 00:10:01,600
afford to have their message printed can

261
00:09:59,290 --> 00:10:03,490
mass-produce it and trance it out this

262
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:06,880
is also the first time in history where

263
00:10:03,490 --> 00:10:08,680
the inventor of the technology fails to

264
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:10,930
account for the ramifications of their

265
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:12,910
technology the Catholic Church was a big

266
00:10:10,930 --> 00:10:14,800
proponent of the Gutenberg press maybe

267
00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:16,719
you've heard of the Gutenberg Bible they

268
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:19,120
probably didn't consider the fact that

269
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:20,710
Martin Luther would mass produces 95

270
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:24,910
theses and nail them to a bunch of

271
00:10:20,710 --> 00:10:27,670
Church stores fast-forward you get the

272
00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:29,770
Telegraph and the radio so Telegraph is

273
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:32,770
interesting because it extends the range

274
00:10:29,770 --> 00:10:34,150
and we can now transmit things at the

275
00:10:32,770 --> 00:10:35,680
speed of light now we take a step

276
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:37,810
backwards in the sense that you have to

277
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:39,550
know Morse code and you have to know

278
00:10:37,810 --> 00:10:41,199
that the message is coming this is not a

279
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:44,040
broadcast medium this is a

280
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:47,260
point-to-point medium but radio Marconi

281
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:49,569
gives us the broadcast medium and now

282
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:51,790
you can transmit a message at the speed

283
00:10:49,570 --> 00:10:53,770
of light over a fairly long distance

284
00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:55,930
without any specialized knowledge you

285
00:10:53,770 --> 00:10:58,090
only need a radio receiver and to know

286
00:10:55,930 --> 00:11:00,520
the frequency at which to tune in and

287
00:10:58,090 --> 00:11:02,530
again we see kind of this horrible thing

288
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:04,040
of not considering what happens because

289
00:11:02,530 --> 00:11:06,620
the radio is so prevalent it

290
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:08,870
is the de facto way to get news and then

291
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:11,180
War of the Worlds comes out and people

292
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:13,279
not realizing that it's an education or

293
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:14,989
it's an entertainment thing think it's

294
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:17,199
actual news and at least to a fair

295
00:11:14,990 --> 00:11:20,630
amount of panic

296
00:11:17,199 --> 00:11:22,579
fast forward to television 1950s again

297
00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:24,889
we're able to extend farther and further

298
00:11:22,579 --> 00:11:27,229
how we're able to transmit and now we

299
00:11:24,889 --> 00:11:28,759
can transmit not just spoken word or

300
00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:32,720
written word but now we can transmit

301
00:11:28,759 --> 00:11:35,569
images and sound and this becomes the de

302
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:38,600
facto way to influence people all the

303
00:11:35,569 --> 00:11:40,910
way up until social media now if you

304
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:43,069
lived in America even as late as the mid

305
00:11:40,910 --> 00:11:45,439
1990s and you wanted to reach the whole

306
00:11:43,069 --> 00:11:47,420
of the US populace you would probably

307
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:50,509
have to be the president and you would

308
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:53,000
go to ABC and CBS and NBC and go listen

309
00:11:50,509 --> 00:11:55,310
you're gonna put me on or I'm gonna pull

310
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:57,829
your FCC license to transmit and so they

311
00:11:55,310 --> 00:11:59,268
would comply you would go on and do that

312
00:11:57,829 --> 00:12:02,239
but I couldn't just show up at a new

313
00:11:59,269 --> 00:12:04,459
studio and go hey I'd like to talk right

314
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:06,529
so we still have a very limited number

315
00:12:04,459 --> 00:12:09,829
of gatekeepers they're allowed to

316
00:12:06,529 --> 00:12:13,220
control mass communication to the

317
00:12:09,829 --> 00:12:16,099
general populace so now we're here and

318
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:17,779
this closes the loop on the information

319
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:20,720
revolution that was started by the

320
00:12:17,779 --> 00:12:23,810
Gutenberg press we have now democratized

321
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:25,459
mass media anybody can transmit to the

322
00:12:23,810 --> 00:12:27,709
masses and we live in a world where Katy

323
00:12:25,459 --> 00:12:32,449
Perry can reach twice as many people as

324
00:12:27,709 --> 00:12:34,459
the president of the forum of the former

325
00:12:32,449 --> 00:12:35,899
Prime Minister of Britain and she

326
00:12:34,459 --> 00:12:41,479
doesn't have to answer to anyone

327
00:12:35,899 --> 00:12:43,130
there's no gatekeeper there so let's

328
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:44,779
talk a little bit about the instruments

329
00:12:43,130 --> 00:12:46,550
of influence so influence has been done

330
00:12:44,779 --> 00:12:48,470
by nation-states for hundreds of years

331
00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:51,529
so we'll talk a little bit about that

332
00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:53,750
the reason it was done was to force

333
00:12:51,529 --> 00:12:56,569
other countries to do things that we

334
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:59,089
want in our country too that were

335
00:12:56,569 --> 00:13:00,979
beneficial to our country and so the way

336
00:12:59,089 --> 00:13:02,630
that countries influenced each other is

337
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:04,310
they had these levers they could pull on

338
00:13:02,630 --> 00:13:06,920
we call the national instruments of

339
00:13:04,310 --> 00:13:09,170
power and we refer to it as the dye

340
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:11,959
model diplomatic informational of

341
00:13:09,170 --> 00:13:13,310
military and economic and that's great

342
00:13:11,959 --> 00:13:15,018
but unless you work for the government

343
00:13:13,310 --> 00:13:16,888
you work in business and so how are

344
00:13:15,019 --> 00:13:18,899
these applicable to you and

345
00:13:16,889 --> 00:13:20,459
at America well it turns out that you

346
00:13:18,899 --> 00:13:22,259
know your diplomatic instrument of

347
00:13:20,459 --> 00:13:24,089
corporate power is your business deals

348
00:13:22,259 --> 00:13:25,769
and strategic partnerships your

349
00:13:24,089 --> 00:13:29,160
informational is your PR and your

350
00:13:25,769 --> 00:13:32,339
advertising mergers and acquisitions not

351
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:35,249
all of those are friendly and then your

352
00:13:32,339 --> 00:13:37,709
long-term economic is your art Rd in

353
00:13:35,249 --> 00:13:39,629
your capital investments so all of these

354
00:13:37,709 --> 00:13:41,819
instruments can be used by corporations

355
00:13:39,629 --> 00:13:43,980
to influence the public the customers

356
00:13:41,819 --> 00:13:47,639
their partners as well as their

357
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:49,679
competitors so now that we understand

358
00:13:47,639 --> 00:13:51,779
why we may do this and how it happens

359
00:13:49,679 --> 00:13:56,040
let's talk about how we functionally do

360
00:13:51,779 --> 00:13:58,679
this so these are the five DS these are

361
00:13:56,040 --> 00:14:01,919
the strategies for influence distort

362
00:13:58,679 --> 00:14:03,449
dismiss distract divide and dismay walk

363
00:14:01,919 --> 00:14:05,910
through a brief example of each of them

364
00:14:03,449 --> 00:14:08,279
distort is when you take a narrative and

365
00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:08,730
you change the context or the reality of

366
00:14:08,279 --> 00:14:11,129
that

367
00:14:08,730 --> 00:14:13,589
no no Russia is not invading another

368
00:14:11,129 --> 00:14:16,709
country we are liberating ethnic

369
00:14:13,589 --> 00:14:18,419
Russians dismiss is when you outright

370
00:14:16,709 --> 00:14:20,368
dismiss the narrative and counter

371
00:14:18,419 --> 00:14:21,720
accused China has been doing this for

372
00:14:20,369 --> 00:14:23,850
years every time they're accused of

373
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:26,309
intellectual property theft are accused

374
00:14:23,850 --> 00:14:28,169
of hacking by the United States the

375
00:14:26,309 --> 00:14:30,389
standard response out of China is not

376
00:14:28,169 --> 00:14:32,369
only do we not do that we ourselves are

377
00:14:30,389 --> 00:14:34,399
victims of the greatest aggression in

378
00:14:32,369 --> 00:14:36,329
cyberspace which is the United States

379
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:37,649
distract is when you're presented in a

380
00:14:36,329 --> 00:14:38,849
narrative you don't address the

381
00:14:37,649 --> 00:14:40,559
narrative you're presented you make up

382
00:14:38,850 --> 00:14:44,759
another narrative to distract from the

383
00:14:40,559 --> 00:14:46,529
original conversation mh17 was

384
00:14:44,759 --> 00:14:48,269
purportedly shot down by Russian missile

385
00:14:46,529 --> 00:14:50,100
the Russian response to that wasn't to

386
00:14:48,269 --> 00:14:52,139
address that it was to ask the question

387
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:55,589
why is there commercial commercial

388
00:14:52,139 --> 00:14:56,939
airliner flying into a war zone divide

389
00:14:55,589 --> 00:14:59,459
is something that we've seen recently

390
00:14:56,939 --> 00:15:01,498
and was a big component of the last

391
00:14:59,459 --> 00:15:03,748
presidential elections it's when you get

392
00:15:01,499 --> 00:15:05,429
the population you bifurcate them you

393
00:15:03,749 --> 00:15:06,809
get them warm with each other and so

394
00:15:05,429 --> 00:15:09,139
they're not paying attention to what's

395
00:15:06,809 --> 00:15:12,179
being done outside of their own scope

396
00:15:09,139 --> 00:15:13,649
dismay is ad hominem personalized

397
00:15:12,179 --> 00:15:15,569
attacks these are usually attacks that

398
00:15:13,649 --> 00:15:18,209
are of a personal nature and they're so

399
00:15:15,569 --> 00:15:20,069
outlandish so ridiculous that the fact

400
00:15:18,209 --> 00:15:22,949
that you even address them lends them

401
00:15:20,069 --> 00:15:25,110
credence and probably the most known

402
00:15:22,949 --> 00:15:26,549
example is pizza gate there is no way to

403
00:15:25,110 --> 00:15:28,740
address those accusations without

404
00:15:26,549 --> 00:15:30,630
lending the attack credence and

405
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:32,880
no defense is really going to solve that

406
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:34,800
issue so what do you need to do this

407
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:37,680
well on social media you need a series

408
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:40,079
of accounts bots is the are the first

409
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:41,880
accounts bots are relatively stupid they

410
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:44,399
don't generate content what they do is

411
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:47,250
they amplify content they retweet they

412
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:49,020
like their repost parody counts are

413
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:51,180
exactly what it says they are parodies

414
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:54,300
of real entities they should not be

415
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:56,969
mistaken for the actual accounts they're

416
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:58,829
there to spoof or make fun of or make

417
00:15:56,970 --> 00:16:02,279
sound ridiculous actual accounts of

418
00:15:58,830 --> 00:16:04,380
people and entities spoof are meant to

419
00:16:02,279 --> 00:16:06,270
be mistaken for the actual accounts but

420
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:08,070
they're not the real accounts there's a

421
00:16:06,270 --> 00:16:09,990
reason that the president's Twitter

422
00:16:08,070 --> 00:16:11,940
account is the real Donald Trump if you

423
00:16:09,990 --> 00:16:13,709
ever want to have some fun go on Twitter

424
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:17,040
and just look for accounts to say Donald

425
00:16:13,709 --> 00:16:20,760
Trump it's kind of horrifying all of

426
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:22,649
them last the next one is camouflage

427
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:24,420
camouflage is used to infiltrate group

428
00:16:22,649 --> 00:16:26,550
groups and this is particularly useful

429
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:28,110
if you're using the divide tactic so

430
00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:30,779
what you do is you get two groups at our

431
00:16:28,110 --> 00:16:32,970
opposite ends so let's say the Democrats

432
00:16:30,779 --> 00:16:34,470
are the Republicans you may manufacture

433
00:16:32,970 --> 00:16:35,730
a persona so you can get invited to

434
00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:37,740
those groups and you change the

435
00:16:35,730 --> 00:16:39,510
narratives internal to those groups so

436
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:42,060
you can get them warring with each other

437
00:16:39,510 --> 00:16:43,620
Deep Cover accounts are rare they're

438
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:45,810
very expensive they're very time

439
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:47,880
intensive they're very resource

440
00:16:45,810 --> 00:16:50,640
intensive these are fully backed stop

441
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:52,050
personas if you try to verify and they

442
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:53,850
look like real people and if they're

443
00:16:52,050 --> 00:16:56,370
done correctly they never get found out

444
00:16:53,850 --> 00:16:57,870
the last one in the most dangerous is

445
00:16:56,370 --> 00:16:59,520
the takeover that's when the real

446
00:16:57,870 --> 00:17:03,450
legitimate account of that person or

447
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:05,910
entity is hijacked by somebody else so

448
00:17:03,450 --> 00:17:08,490
an example that was shown earlier was

449
00:17:05,910 --> 00:17:12,829
The Associated Press Twitter account in

450
00:17:08,490 --> 00:17:14,939
October of 2013 was hijacked

451
00:17:12,829 --> 00:17:16,169
there was a fake news story put out

452
00:17:14,939 --> 00:17:18,240
saying that there was a bombing at the

453
00:17:16,170 --> 00:17:19,800
White House and the Dow Jones fell so

454
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:25,230
precipitously that they suspended

455
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:28,409
trading so Pablo gave you an overview of

456
00:17:25,230 --> 00:17:31,530
the tools and ingredients that go into

457
00:17:28,410 --> 00:17:34,410
this process and now as I said a

458
00:17:31,530 --> 00:17:36,800
socio-technical system is the way of

459
00:17:34,410 --> 00:17:38,720
thinking that turns this into a hacking

460
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:41,780
problem or a cybersecurity problem a

461
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:44,420
socio technical system is a machine

462
00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:46,730
where the moving parts are people

463
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:49,190
connected by networks the inputs are

464
00:17:46,730 --> 00:17:52,220
narratives and the outputs are things

465
00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:54,440
like markets or elections that involve

466
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:56,150
aggregate behaviors not individual

467
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:58,160
behaviors you can't really model

468
00:17:56,150 --> 00:18:00,740
individual behaviors in a way that is

469
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:06,080
good enough to matter but you can model

470
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:08,360
aggregate behaviors very well the model

471
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:10,790
offers enhanced efficiency to those who

472
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:12,590
want to manipulate human behavior it's

473
00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:15,350
successful employment is a legitimate

474
00:18:12,590 --> 00:18:19,510
subject of concern mathematical

475
00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:19,510
applications in political science 1966

476
00:18:20,590 --> 00:18:26,000
so socio technical system is a system of

477
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:28,910
systems which means that in order to

478
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:32,180
understand it you have to consider both

479
00:18:28,910 --> 00:18:33,710
the technology and the sociology or in

480
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:35,720
particular political economics is the

481
00:18:33,710 --> 00:18:38,810
field that models these things

482
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:40,490
numerically if you try to just think of

483
00:18:38,810 --> 00:18:41,810
it as a technology problem or just think

484
00:18:40,490 --> 00:18:43,730
of it as a psychology problem you're

485
00:18:41,810 --> 00:18:47,330
going to miss all the important emergent

486
00:18:43,730 --> 00:18:49,490
behaviors now the models that they were

487
00:18:47,330 --> 00:18:51,710
talking about in 1966 from political

488
00:18:49,490 --> 00:18:55,010
economics nowadays thanks to big data

489
00:18:51,710 --> 00:18:57,620
machine learning operating on the data

490
00:18:55,010 --> 00:19:01,400
available from online behavior it is

491
00:18:57,620 --> 00:19:02,989
much more real so some of you are

492
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:05,180
already data scientists and I certainly

493
00:19:02,990 --> 00:19:06,740
don't have time to be able to explain

494
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:09,230
data science in detail but I'm gonna be

495
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:10,970
just a light overview here sort of a

496
00:19:09,230 --> 00:19:13,460
visual representation to give you an

497
00:19:10,970 --> 00:19:16,010
idea of what it means to think about

498
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:18,740
packing a socio technical system as a

499
00:19:16,010 --> 00:19:21,320
system if you're actually doing this in

500
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:23,870
a formal mathematical way so you

501
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:27,260
represent a population as a high

502
00:19:23,870 --> 00:19:29,090
dimensional data set it's called a

503
00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:30,470
preference space each dimension is one

504
00:19:29,090 --> 00:19:32,629
of the different beliefs or ideas that

505
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:34,040
somebody might have and when you

506
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:35,870
represent it like this then you can do

507
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:39,200
analysis and planning using mathematical

508
00:19:35,870 --> 00:19:40,790
and computational tools so there's an

509
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:42,680
important concept the Overton Window

510
00:19:40,790 --> 00:19:45,620
this is the range of acceptable

511
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:47,360
discourse in a media ecosystem it's a

512
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:48,050
collective phenomenon it's not an

513
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:51,350
individual

514
00:19:48,050 --> 00:19:54,440
this is what that population can handle

515
00:19:51,350 --> 00:19:56,179
in general not the outliers in reality

516
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:57,770
I'm showing you a two-dimensional graph

517
00:19:56,180 --> 00:19:59,840
here in reality like I said there's a

518
00:19:57,770 --> 00:20:01,520
very high dimensional data set the

519
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:04,760
original idea of the Overton Window is

520
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:06,889
just a left-right spectacle spectrum but

521
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:10,040
it generalizes easily to this big data

522
00:20:06,890 --> 00:20:11,180
problem now imagine that there's a

523
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:12,980
message that you want to get out there

524
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:15,110
that's well outside the Overton Window

525
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:17,540
it's a lot of work to do a PR campaign

526
00:20:15,110 --> 00:20:20,899
in a traditional sense where you're

527
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:22,730
going to slowly ease people toward

528
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:24,110
something that they're really not okay

529
00:20:22,730 --> 00:20:26,480
with yet it could take a whole

530
00:20:24,110 --> 00:20:28,070
generation for one group of people to

531
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:29,360
die out and another group of people to

532
00:20:28,070 --> 00:20:33,020
grow up that are used to your new way of

533
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:36,040
thinking but if you work with the math

534
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:39,200
here you can see a possible shortcut

535
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:40,340
this is actually based on what you would

536
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:42,410
call the door in the face sales

537
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:44,389
technique but it's adapted to this sort

538
00:20:42,410 --> 00:20:47,090
of political economics model you start

539
00:20:44,390 --> 00:20:49,190
with a crazy pitch that is to say you

540
00:20:47,090 --> 00:20:52,250
have some sort of crazy idea in you

541
00:20:49,190 --> 00:20:54,380
rally a small vocal group fringe group

542
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:56,840
the data science model can help you

543
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:58,880
target and target the anchor message

544
00:20:56,840 --> 00:21:01,370
that you're using for this process the

545
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:03,200
crazy message and it can do that because

546
00:21:01,370 --> 00:21:05,600
you have your target message and then

547
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:07,400
you have your anchor message and you can

548
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:09,050
analyze where the population

549
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:11,060
distribution is and where your messages

550
00:21:09,050 --> 00:21:14,870
are within the manifold embedding of the

551
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:17,780
preference base if you can get enough

552
00:21:14,870 --> 00:21:19,520
people talking about it then the fact

553
00:21:17,780 --> 00:21:22,250
that people are talking about a crazy

554
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:24,530
new idea automatically gets it into the

555
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:27,740
news and this has stretched the Overton

556
00:21:24,530 --> 00:21:29,690
Window so for example if people are

557
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:31,130
talking about the cinnamon challenge and

558
00:21:29,690 --> 00:21:33,410
they're eating spoonfuls of cinnamon

559
00:21:31,130 --> 00:21:35,300
then suddenly in comparison to that

560
00:21:33,410 --> 00:21:37,550
eating spoonfuls of oregano doesn't seem

561
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:39,860
crazy at all and this of course is

562
00:21:37,550 --> 00:21:43,330
easier than just directly convincing

563
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:46,639
people to eat spoonfuls of oregano

564
00:21:43,330 --> 00:21:48,679
so now that I've pointed out this idea

565
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:50,990
of a fringe group now I can explain the

566
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:52,850
title of the talk the 10-million useful

567
00:21:50,990 --> 00:21:54,710
idiots the useful idiots is a term from

568
00:21:52,850 --> 00:21:56,540
soviet-era propaganda it refers to

569
00:21:54,710 --> 00:21:58,550
useful idiots are people who are

570
00:21:56,540 --> 00:21:59,270
unwitting participants in spreading

571
00:21:58,550 --> 00:22:03,260
adversity

572
00:21:59,270 --> 00:22:05,120
propaganda and with social media in

573
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:07,190
particular and these planning techniques

574
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:09,199
you can do this on a mass scale rather

575
00:22:07,190 --> 00:22:10,400
than sort of individuals which was more

576
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:13,550
what they were thinking of back in the

577
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:16,100
Cold War era of course with with the

578
00:22:13,550 --> 00:22:18,050
internet it makes it very easy to find

579
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:19,969
large numbers of gullible people to

580
00:22:18,050 --> 00:22:21,980
participate in whatever scam you want

581
00:22:19,970 --> 00:22:26,420
think about 419 scam emails or almost

582
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:28,670
any online scan so again these aren't

583
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:31,400
news so we've tried some defenses in

584
00:22:28,670 --> 00:22:34,040
some mitigations in the past but we've

585
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:35,420
not completely understood the problem

586
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:37,970
but let's examine what's been done in

587
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:39,580
the past so I think most of us are

588
00:22:37,970 --> 00:22:42,440
probably familiar with fact checkers

589
00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:44,030
there are automated it and there are

590
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:45,440
manual fact checkers a manual fact

591
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:49,040
checker would be something like Snopes

592
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:51,080
or PolitiFact they're a little time late

593
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:53,450
because you manually have to go in and

594
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:56,629
verify the fact automatic fact checkers

595
00:22:53,450 --> 00:22:59,330
split any given purported fact into a

596
00:22:56,630 --> 00:23:00,740
triplet subject/object predicate and

597
00:22:59,330 --> 00:23:02,810
then they have to decide whether they're

598
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:05,570
an open world or closed world model and

599
00:23:02,810 --> 00:23:07,610
an open world new purported facts are

600
00:23:05,570 --> 00:23:09,620
assumed true unless they violate a

601
00:23:07,610 --> 00:23:11,120
previously accepted fact and a closed

602
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:14,060
world all new purported facts are

603
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:16,129
assumed false until we verify that it

604
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:18,379
doesn't run amuck of any existing fact

605
00:23:16,130 --> 00:23:21,380
either way the problem here is they

606
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:25,820
can't handle SATA tire or editorials so

607
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:27,110
it's of arguable use on social media

608
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:29,179
social media analysis we can use

609
00:23:27,110 --> 00:23:32,570
propagation based detection or time

610
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:35,210
based Cascades the top graphs there are

611
00:23:32,570 --> 00:23:37,669
propagation based and on the left hand

612
00:23:35,210 --> 00:23:39,440
side what you should see is unconfirmed

613
00:23:37,670 --> 00:23:42,290
news and the reason that there are

614
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:44,390
multiple peaks there is those bots that

615
00:23:42,290 --> 00:23:46,659
periodically reamp Liffe i the false

616
00:23:44,390 --> 00:23:49,040
message to keep it in public discourse

617
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:51,440
whereas the graph on the right is

618
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:53,870
confirmed news it appears in the new

619
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:55,730
cycle it's accepted as fact nobody

620
00:23:53,870 --> 00:23:58,939
argues the point and so it gradually

621
00:23:55,730 --> 00:24:02,420
cascades down at the bottom you've got

622
00:23:58,940 --> 00:24:04,490
the Cascade breadth and depth the green

623
00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:07,400
line in this case is true news and the

624
00:24:04,490 --> 00:24:09,200
red line is fake news and again the

625
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:10,870
reason that you get a more graceful

626
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:13,630
degradation of true news

627
00:24:10,870 --> 00:24:15,610
is that people see it they forward it to

628
00:24:13,630 --> 00:24:17,320
their own networks they see it they

629
00:24:15,610 --> 00:24:19,360
forward it to their own networks and it

630
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:21,610
gradually goes away the reason you have

631
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:23,860
an inflection point on the cascade max

632
00:24:21,610 --> 00:24:26,110
breath is because again those bots will

633
00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:28,899
pre odd periodically reamp Liffe i that

634
00:24:26,110 --> 00:24:30,490
message more people that didn't see it

635
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:32,410
the first time will see it they'll

636
00:24:30,490 --> 00:24:36,370
forward it to their networks and so you

637
00:24:32,410 --> 00:24:38,620
get a much much much slower decay other

638
00:24:36,370 --> 00:24:40,090
models that we've used the epidemic

639
00:24:38,620 --> 00:24:41,770
diffusion model this is one that came

640
00:24:40,090 --> 00:24:43,810
out of medicine it's used for infectious

641
00:24:41,770 --> 00:24:46,690
diseases and so if you look at this

642
00:24:43,810 --> 00:24:48,610
model s is your subject it's the person

643
00:24:46,690 --> 00:24:50,880
that's you are C is the rate at which

644
00:24:48,610 --> 00:24:54,969
you are contacted by false information

645
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:57,040
and then i's the you being infected and

646
00:24:54,970 --> 00:24:59,140
then you can be cured of it realize that

647
00:24:57,040 --> 00:25:00,730
you've been infected with fake news and

648
00:24:59,140 --> 00:25:02,920
go back and delete the post delete the

649
00:25:00,730 --> 00:25:04,600
tweet the problem here is while the

650
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:07,660
model is nice and simple and easy to

651
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:10,389
understand we don't know what causes

652
00:25:07,660 --> 00:25:12,580
that catalyst change to go from I've

653
00:25:10,390 --> 00:25:14,200
been contacted by false information to

654
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:15,669
now have been infected with false

655
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:17,860
information and we really don't

656
00:25:15,670 --> 00:25:19,300
understand once you're infected what it

657
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:21,699
takes to convince you to realize that

658
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:24,700
you've been infected and go back and

659
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:27,430
solve the problem the bottom model is a

660
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:29,470
favorite of social network analysis is

661
00:25:27,430 --> 00:25:31,270
called a scale-free network in

662
00:25:29,470 --> 00:25:33,550
scale-free networks the predominant

663
00:25:31,270 --> 00:25:35,889
characteristic is the formation of links

664
00:25:33,550 --> 00:25:37,899
you form links at a much higher rate

665
00:25:35,890 --> 00:25:39,610
than you lose links unfortunately in

666
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:43,510
this case what we see with

667
00:25:39,610 --> 00:25:45,189
misinformation is that the population

668
00:25:43,510 --> 00:25:46,900
gets bifurcated and so the governing

669
00:25:45,190 --> 00:25:49,000
characteristic isn't the formation of

670
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:51,100
links it's the destruction of links

671
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:56,710
between nodes and so we really don't

672
00:25:51,100 --> 00:26:00,969
have a good Network model for this kind

673
00:25:56,710 --> 00:26:02,530
of social epidemic so some analysis

674
00:26:00,970 --> 00:26:04,390
challenges beyond what I've mentioned

675
00:26:02,530 --> 00:26:06,280
for those the problem with

676
00:26:04,390 --> 00:26:08,050
misinformation is you want to label it

677
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:08,590
as misinformation before the public

678
00:26:08,050 --> 00:26:11,950
season

679
00:26:08,590 --> 00:26:14,980
well we create content at a tremendous

680
00:26:11,950 --> 00:26:18,010
pace four point three million videos

681
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:20,110
viewed in a minute in 60 seconds we now

682
00:26:18,010 --> 00:26:21,640
have more computers on the internet than

683
00:26:20,110 --> 00:26:23,800
there are people on the planet Earth

684
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:26,470
this problem is only going

685
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:27,790
get worse the speed of propagation is

686
00:26:26,470 --> 00:26:30,190
only going to get faster the

687
00:26:27,790 --> 00:26:32,500
computational power required to look at

688
00:26:30,190 --> 00:26:35,260
this information and analyze it is going

689
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:37,150
to become greater up until recently we

690
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:38,830
haven't had a framework where we could

691
00:26:37,150 --> 00:26:40,270
define these attacks we haven't had a

692
00:26:38,830 --> 00:26:43,659
kill chain we could explain what's going

693
00:26:40,270 --> 00:26:46,629
on David mentioned the system of systems

694
00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:48,670
one of the characteristics of Systems

695
00:26:46,630 --> 00:26:50,710
Theory is when you have a system of

696
00:26:48,670 --> 00:26:52,090
systems the whole is greater than the

697
00:26:50,710 --> 00:26:53,620
sum of the parts of so you get the

698
00:26:52,090 --> 00:26:55,419
emergence of characteristics

699
00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:56,949
maybe we can define how many youtube

700
00:26:55,420 --> 00:26:59,380
videos you see before you're convinced

701
00:26:56,950 --> 00:27:00,940
of a fact but what we don't understand

702
00:26:59,380 --> 00:27:03,250
is what happens if you watch that many

703
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:06,010
YouTube videos and see that many tweets

704
00:27:03,250 --> 00:27:10,300
and see that many ins to grant posts how

705
00:27:06,010 --> 00:27:11,890
much harder is it the last bits are

706
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:13,750
cognitive dissonance and cognitive

707
00:27:11,890 --> 00:27:16,390
friction the reason that misinformation

708
00:27:13,750 --> 00:27:18,070
works is you are already biased to

709
00:27:16,390 --> 00:27:20,800
believe the misinformation that you're

710
00:27:18,070 --> 00:27:24,040
being presented and so convincing you

711
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:26,169
that your original view is wrong is is

712
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:27,610
hard right you want to hold on to your

713
00:27:26,170 --> 00:27:31,090
views you don't want to believe you're

714
00:27:27,610 --> 00:27:32,949
wrong once you accept something as true

715
00:27:31,090 --> 00:27:35,560
that's your kind of friction on top of

716
00:27:32,950 --> 00:27:38,470
that not only do you have to change your

717
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:40,000
mind you have to admit that something is

718
00:27:38,470 --> 00:27:42,370
true that you're not comfortable with

719
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:44,710
and that's that cognitive dissonance and

720
00:27:42,370 --> 00:27:47,139
that is very hard it is much harder to

721
00:27:44,710 --> 00:27:49,000
convince you of something if you believe

722
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:51,990
the opposite then if you have no belief

723
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:54,700
in it one way or the other

724
00:27:51,990 --> 00:27:58,540
anybody familiar with this copy of the

725
00:27:54,700 --> 00:28:02,740
Washington Post this is fascinating this

726
00:27:58,540 --> 00:28:04,389
happened last December this is a very

727
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:07,360
convincing message right it looks like

728
00:28:04,390 --> 00:28:09,520
the Washington Post you know if you have

729
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:12,580
certain political beliefs you're gonna

730
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:14,350
be biased to actually believe this who's

731
00:28:12,580 --> 00:28:16,300
going to dissent right if you go to the

732
00:28:14,350 --> 00:28:17,770
newsstand at Union Station you pick up

733
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:19,210
this copy the Washington Post are you

734
00:28:17,770 --> 00:28:21,100
gonna pick up another newspaper that's

735
00:28:19,210 --> 00:28:22,570
going to disagree with this and hack the

736
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:25,149
Washington Post is an authoritative

737
00:28:22,570 --> 00:28:26,919
source it turns out in this case that

738
00:28:25,150 --> 00:28:29,980
this was a fairly large misinformation

739
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:32,740
campaign by the orange group they

740
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:34,330
labeled it as satire a rose by any other

741
00:28:32,740 --> 00:28:36,490
name it's still misinformation

742
00:28:34,330 --> 00:28:37,510
so in December at Yuna Station in

743
00:28:36,490 --> 00:28:39,250
Washington DC

744
00:28:37,510 --> 00:28:41,140
if he went to new stands if you went to

745
00:28:39,250 --> 00:28:42,760
the coffee shop these were actually

746
00:28:41,140 --> 00:28:45,400
sitting there and they were so

747
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:48,460
convincing that the actual Washington

748
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:51,160
Post not only filed a suit but they were

749
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:53,380
compelled to actually respond via their

750
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:55,000
official social media and say this was

751
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:56,710
not us that is not the official

752
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:58,780
Washington Post

753
00:28:56,710 --> 00:29:00,370
interesting factoid this is the first

754
00:28:58,780 --> 00:29:02,649
time since World War two that the

755
00:29:00,370 --> 00:29:05,168
American populace has been subject to

756
00:29:02,650 --> 00:29:08,890
large-scale physical psychological

757
00:29:05,169 --> 00:29:11,799
operations products and if we have this

758
00:29:08,890 --> 00:29:15,070
hard time with static text and Static

759
00:29:11,799 --> 00:29:18,270
pictures and with blog post then you

760
00:29:15,070 --> 00:29:20,559
know what's coming next is much harder I

761
00:29:18,270 --> 00:29:23,110
wish I could keep telling you that our

762
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:25,480
mission in life is connecting people but

763
00:29:23,110 --> 00:29:28,719
it isn't we just want to predict your

764
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:30,700
future behaviors Spectre showed me how

765
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:33,130
to manipulate you into sharing intimate

766
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:35,740
data about yourself and all those you

767
00:29:33,130 --> 00:29:39,790
love for free the more you express

768
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:44,799
yourself the more we own you couldn't

769
00:29:39,790 --> 00:29:46,600
happen to a nicer guy so you know we're

770
00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:49,270
we're fairly educated we know the

771
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:51,639
dangers we know deep fakes we understand

772
00:29:49,270 --> 00:29:53,679
technology but the average citizen

773
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:55,150
doesn't if they see a video they're

774
00:29:53,679 --> 00:29:57,340
gonna believe their eyes and they're

775
00:29:55,150 --> 00:30:00,850
gonna believe their ears and imagine

776
00:29:57,340 --> 00:30:02,230
it's some anti-government video now

777
00:30:00,850 --> 00:30:05,139
we're gonna bring up some computer

778
00:30:02,230 --> 00:30:06,580
scientist one of us write some

779
00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:09,070
cybersecurity expert that's going to

780
00:30:06,580 --> 00:30:11,129
point out all the metadata indicators

781
00:30:09,070 --> 00:30:13,809
that this thing has been manipulated and

782
00:30:11,130 --> 00:30:15,580
if you believe the video what you're

783
00:30:13,809 --> 00:30:16,928
gonna say is that that scientist that's

784
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:19,899
given you all that scientific

785
00:30:16,929 --> 00:30:25,480
gobbledygook is a government shill this

786
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:27,669
problem is gonna get much much harder so

787
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:29,440
now that we've realized how bad the

788
00:30:27,669 --> 00:30:32,380
problem is we need to figure out a way

789
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:35,350
forward right and perfection is the

790
00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:36,940
enemy of progress we can't just sit on

791
00:30:35,350 --> 00:30:40,059
it wait for the perfect answer so what

792
00:30:36,940 --> 00:30:41,470
is it that we can do now well the first

793
00:30:40,059 --> 00:30:43,480
thing we can do is try to understand the

794
00:30:41,470 --> 00:30:45,220
problem this is a model that we've

795
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:47,559
developed in the Missis InfoSec working

796
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:49,480
group it is the misinformation pyramid

797
00:30:47,559 --> 00:30:50,820
and there are two ways to look at this

798
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:52,380
if you were an attacker if you

799
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:54,899
that is conducting the misinformation

800
00:30:52,380 --> 00:30:57,120
you start at the top of the pyramid you

801
00:30:54,899 --> 00:30:58,739
have a companion you have a desired end

802
00:30:57,120 --> 00:31:00,719
state you have something that you want

803
00:30:58,740 --> 00:31:02,460
people to do and you're gonna

804
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:03,600
manufacture incidents within those

805
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:05,190
incidents are going to be various

806
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:06,750
narratives and those narratives are

807
00:31:05,190 --> 00:31:10,350
going to have various artifacts memes

808
00:31:06,750 --> 00:31:11,880
post stories pictures and so there's a

809
00:31:10,350 --> 00:31:13,259
direct line and you can look from the

810
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:15,360
top of the campaign and see how

811
00:31:13,259 --> 00:31:18,179
everything from the bottom links up to

812
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:19,860
the top the problem is that if you're a

813
00:31:18,179 --> 00:31:22,289
defender you start at the bottom of the

814
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:25,439
pyramid you start out by looking at

815
00:31:22,289 --> 00:31:27,600
tweets and pictures and news stories and

816
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:30,120
you have to figure out what are these

817
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:32,459
legitimate or these artifacts and then

818
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:33,899
if their artifacts are these artifacts

819
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:35,429
link you have to figure out which of

820
00:31:33,899 --> 00:31:38,039
these are linked together so that you

821
00:31:35,429 --> 00:31:39,570
can discern the narrative and once you

822
00:31:38,039 --> 00:31:41,789
get enough narratives you can move up

823
00:31:39,570 --> 00:31:43,830
and go ah this is an incident of X and

824
00:31:41,789 --> 00:31:44,970
then you can try to do some attribution

825
00:31:43,830 --> 00:31:45,779
try to figure out what the campaign is

826
00:31:44,970 --> 00:31:47,940
trying to do

827
00:31:45,779 --> 00:31:50,700
the point being moving up the grip the

828
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:55,440
pyramid fighting gravity is much harder

829
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:57,240
and requires a lot more data so who

830
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:59,340
needs to get involved in this well we

831
00:31:57,240 --> 00:32:01,549
need industry we need academia we need

832
00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:04,980
media we need the community all of you

833
00:32:01,549 --> 00:32:07,320
we need some government help and we need

834
00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:09,539
the InfoSec industry this is not a mine

835
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:11,879
in yours problem this is an ours problem

836
00:32:09,539 --> 00:32:14,039
we need everybody involved part of the

837
00:32:11,879 --> 00:32:17,129
issue is we all speak different

838
00:32:14,039 --> 00:32:19,230
languages so that's why the

839
00:32:17,129 --> 00:32:20,759
misinformation working group developed

840
00:32:19,230 --> 00:32:22,740
em at the adversarial misinformation

841
00:32:20,759 --> 00:32:25,110
influence tactics and techniques

842
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:27,389
framework if you're familiar with miters

843
00:32:25,110 --> 00:32:30,240
attack framework this is very similar

844
00:32:27,389 --> 00:32:33,320
it's actually completely compatible with

845
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:36,779
the attack framework and it describes

846
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:38,820
the kill chain and the TTP's tactics

847
00:32:36,779 --> 00:32:41,820
techniques and procedures to carry out

848
00:32:38,820 --> 00:32:44,158
an information misinformation influence

849
00:32:41,820 --> 00:32:45,799
attack the box is at the top of the

850
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:49,440
various phases planning preparation

851
00:32:45,799 --> 00:32:52,320
execution evaluation below that the blue

852
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:54,779
boxes are the stages and then the white

853
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:56,340
boxes are the techniques tactics and

854
00:32:54,779 --> 00:32:58,350
procedures within each of those if

855
00:32:56,340 --> 00:33:01,439
you're interested in seeing these please

856
00:32:58,350 --> 00:33:04,050
go to mis InfoSec org you can see these

857
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:06,330
you can click on all the TTP

858
00:33:04,050 --> 00:33:08,780
you can see the descriptions you can see

859
00:33:06,330 --> 00:33:12,149
actual incidents where we pull that

860
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:14,670
description and you can add to this if

861
00:33:12,150 --> 00:33:16,770
we miss things we want your input if we

862
00:33:14,670 --> 00:33:21,300
got it wrong we want your input if you

863
00:33:16,770 --> 00:33:22,950
like what it is then use it so red team

864
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:24,540
of blue teams how could we do this well

865
00:33:22,950 --> 00:33:26,010
we can keep doing the things that we're

866
00:33:24,540 --> 00:33:28,889
doing but now we have to consider more

867
00:33:26,010 --> 00:33:30,660
than the ones and zeros we need to make

868
00:33:28,890 --> 00:33:33,390
sure that things are secure by design if

869
00:33:30,660 --> 00:33:35,100
you're making a platform for information

870
00:33:33,390 --> 00:33:37,650
exchange if you're making a social

871
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:40,080
platform consider how this could be used

872
00:33:37,650 --> 00:33:41,820
and abused if you're marketing this

873
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:43,050
thing to teenagers bullying is going to

874
00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:45,120
happen how are you going to deal with

875
00:33:43,050 --> 00:33:47,129
that if it's a news media who gets to

876
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:50,159
publish how are you going to verify the

877
00:33:47,130 --> 00:33:51,720
provenance of that information SEC dev

878
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:53,250
ops you should be doing this as you're

879
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:56,040
developing the program so you can build

880
00:33:53,250 --> 00:33:58,050
in protections during development and

881
00:33:56,040 --> 00:34:00,000
not at the end you should have

882
00:33:58,050 --> 00:34:02,580
centralized monitoring not just for the

883
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:04,560
health of the digits but also for the

884
00:34:02,580 --> 00:34:06,240
health of the conversation the other

885
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:08,310
thing we should do is assume a breach

886
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:11,130
assume that your product and your

887
00:34:08,310 --> 00:34:13,889
platform are going to be abused have a

888
00:34:11,130 --> 00:34:15,360
plan in place to respond to it how are

889
00:34:13,889 --> 00:34:17,609
you going to respond to defects being

890
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:20,429
used on your platform for the red team's

891
00:34:17,610 --> 00:34:22,530
very easy threat modeling you should be

892
00:34:20,429 --> 00:34:25,290
able to add this kind of attack the

893
00:34:22,530 --> 00:34:27,840
socio-technical system attacks to your

894
00:34:25,290 --> 00:34:30,360
products you should consider those types

895
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:32,910
of adversaries you should test for those

896
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:34,860
adversaries you should do the code view

897
00:34:32,909 --> 00:34:37,678
and verify that the protections that we

898
00:34:34,860 --> 00:34:39,950
put in there are actually valid and

899
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:39,950
useful

900
00:34:40,070 --> 00:34:46,950
so in summary misinformation is a socio

901
00:34:44,310 --> 00:34:49,230
technical security problem a socio

902
00:34:46,949 --> 00:34:50,730
technical system the populations plus

903
00:34:49,230 --> 00:34:54,210
the networks the whole thing can be

904
00:34:50,730 --> 00:34:55,530
hacked this has physical and financial

905
00:34:54,210 --> 00:34:57,600
consequences for your business

906
00:34:55,530 --> 00:34:59,460
businesses need to care about this this

907
00:34:57,600 --> 00:35:01,920
isn't just a political problem and it's

908
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:04,800
certainly not just a PR problem it's a

909
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:07,380
security problem technology cannot solve

910
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:08,700
it alone when you consider the ways that

911
00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:10,020
your product can go wrong you need to

912
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:12,390
consider the ways that your product can

913
00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:13,960
go wrong with the population of users

914
00:35:12,390 --> 00:35:16,930
and that

915
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:18,580
design problem for the product every new

916
00:35:16,930 --> 00:35:21,669
product has to consider how it will be

917
00:35:18,580 --> 00:35:24,250
abused as I said and we need to share

918
00:35:21,670 --> 00:35:26,260
that information across communities will

919
00:35:24,250 --> 00:35:28,030
tell you a little bit more at the end

920
00:35:26,260 --> 00:35:32,050
about what we've done to help make that

921
00:35:28,030 --> 00:35:33,460
possible for you so a parting thought

922
00:35:32,050 --> 00:35:35,800
it's very easy to look at this from a

923
00:35:33,460 --> 00:35:37,540
Western perspective where government and

924
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:39,580
industry are separate that is not the

925
00:35:37,540 --> 00:35:41,890
case everywhere else and remember I

926
00:35:39,580 --> 00:35:43,869
mentioned that nation state instrument

927
00:35:41,890 --> 00:35:45,848
of national power of the economy it

928
00:35:43,869 --> 00:35:48,760
could very well happen that your company

929
00:35:45,849 --> 00:35:52,330
is the target of a nation-state economic

930
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:55,710
influence campaign so this is a notional

931
00:35:52,330 --> 00:35:59,200
thing this is happening right now

932
00:35:55,710 --> 00:36:00,730
so blackhat soundbites the most

933
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:02,618
important thing that we would like you

934
00:36:00,730 --> 00:36:04,180
to do if you're convinced by any of this

935
00:36:02,619 --> 00:36:06,849
is tell your corporate leadership to

936
00:36:04,180 --> 00:36:08,740
care about this tell them that this is a

937
00:36:06,849 --> 00:36:10,480
security problem it's something that you

938
00:36:08,740 --> 00:36:11,680
either need to design into your products

939
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:15,280
or you need to look at how it might

940
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:17,020
affect your business please go to mis

941
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:19,000
InfoSec dot org look at the work that

942
00:36:17,020 --> 00:36:21,099
mystify SEC Working Group has done look

943
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:23,230
at amat tell us that's useful tell us

944
00:36:21,099 --> 00:36:25,030
it's not tell us what we missed tell us

945
00:36:23,230 --> 00:36:28,330
what we got right and then implement it

946
00:36:25,030 --> 00:36:30,970
or implement something similar follow

947
00:36:28,330 --> 00:36:32,440
Atmos InfoSec on Twitter we have some

948
00:36:30,970 --> 00:36:34,839
very exciting announcements coming up

949
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:38,470
very soon some things that are already

950
00:36:34,839 --> 00:36:40,599
pretty much the ink isn't even dry yet

951
00:36:38,470 --> 00:36:42,430
and we can't quite talk about them but

952
00:36:40,599 --> 00:36:44,859
there's gonna be some big news coming up

953
00:36:42,430 --> 00:36:46,598
soon the last one is there is going to

954
00:36:44,859 --> 00:36:47,940
be a stand-up of a cognitive security

955
00:36:46,599 --> 00:36:50,650
information sharing and analysis

956
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:52,920
organization please consider joining it

957
00:36:50,650 --> 00:36:55,690
get involved share threat indicators

958
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:57,730
we're developing schemas for Styx and

959
00:36:55,690 --> 00:37:00,040
taxi so those threat indicators can be

960
00:36:57,730 --> 00:37:03,369
shared with existing tools and we need

961
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:05,440
your help thanks for coming we do have

962
00:37:03,369 --> 00:37:07,480
time for some questions we would love to

963
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:11,950
talk to you about this and actually I'm

964
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:14,530
very happy that SJ who is the primary

965
00:37:11,950 --> 00:37:16,598
contributor to the github is here so

966
00:37:14,530 --> 00:37:18,580
we'll we're all going to go over to the

967
00:37:16,599 --> 00:37:20,560
wrap room at the end of the time and we

968
00:37:18,580 --> 00:37:22,900
can have some conversations and also we

969
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:24,099
have stickers if you're gonna ask

970
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:25,150
questions please walk up to the

971
00:37:24,099 --> 00:37:27,160
microphones at the beginning so

972
00:37:25,150 --> 00:37:29,280
everybody else can hear do we have any

973
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:29,279
questions

974
00:37:32,150 --> 00:37:41,860
[Applause]

975
00:37:41,950 --> 00:37:46,970
so over time people became skeptical of

976
00:37:45,050 --> 00:37:48,380
the claims of advertisers do you think

977
00:37:46,970 --> 00:37:49,819
that people will also become skeptical

978
00:37:48,380 --> 00:37:51,020
of this kind of misinformation over time

979
00:37:49,820 --> 00:37:52,869
and what do you think of the

980
00:37:51,020 --> 00:37:57,170
implications one way or the other

981
00:37:52,869 --> 00:38:00,619
yes I didn't hear the question but what

982
00:37:57,170 --> 00:38:02,390
he said so the question was people in

983
00:38:00,619 --> 00:38:05,030
the past became skeptical of other

984
00:38:02,390 --> 00:38:06,980
channels of information at first they

985
00:38:05,030 --> 00:38:08,420
were very gullible for instance there

986
00:38:06,980 --> 00:38:09,830
was the War of the Worlds people heard

987
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:11,630
this announcement on the radio and they

988
00:38:09,830 --> 00:38:13,250
panicked nowadays if you heard a story

989
00:38:11,630 --> 00:38:14,840
on the radio you're not gonna have mass

990
00:38:13,250 --> 00:38:17,660
panic people are just kind of used to it

991
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:19,490
they're skeptical and I think it's a

992
00:38:17,660 --> 00:38:22,430
very reasonable prediction that people

993
00:38:19,490 --> 00:38:24,890
will also become skeptical of every

994
00:38:22,430 --> 00:38:26,118
other channel it's possible that the

995
00:38:24,890 --> 00:38:27,710
biggest implication of this is that

996
00:38:26,119 --> 00:38:29,930
people are going to become skeptical of

997
00:38:27,710 --> 00:38:31,190
every source of information and then you

998
00:38:29,930 --> 00:38:32,868
run into a situation where there's

999
00:38:31,190 --> 00:38:35,030
simply no shared knowledge which really

1000
00:38:32,869 --> 00:38:37,820
undermines you know the sort of

1001
00:38:35,030 --> 00:38:41,170
political philosophical foundations of

1002
00:38:37,820 --> 00:38:45,369
the very idea of freedom and democracy

1003
00:38:41,170 --> 00:38:45,369
not that that's a big deal or anything

1004
00:38:45,609 --> 00:38:51,440
swords are real quick first off having

1005
00:38:49,820 --> 00:38:53,420
worked on sticks and taxi for the last

1006
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:55,690
four years I'm really excited to hear

1007
00:38:53,420 --> 00:38:59,119
that you're actually looking at that for

1008
00:38:55,690 --> 00:39:01,280
looking at social attacks we've pondered

1009
00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:03,050
if we could do that do you have any

1010
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:05,089
examples that are out there yet have you

1011
00:39:03,050 --> 00:39:07,130
have you done any research on it how far

1012
00:39:05,089 --> 00:39:09,830
along are you and how can we get

1013
00:39:07,130 --> 00:39:11,570
involved in that and this is why I'm

1014
00:39:09,830 --> 00:39:12,859
particularly glad that SJ is here

1015
00:39:11,570 --> 00:39:14,480
because she can really give you a

1016
00:39:12,859 --> 00:39:16,750
nuts-and-bolts answer to that question

1017
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:19,900
you use the microphone please SJ so that

1018
00:39:16,750 --> 00:39:19,900
yeah yeah

1019
00:39:21,630 --> 00:39:28,500
yeah so high yeah we took mistakes taxi

1020
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:30,120
apart I'm currently in the middle of

1021
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:31,650
implementing that so that's going up on

1022
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:35,730
the repo as soon as I've had enough

1023
00:39:31,650 --> 00:39:37,350
sleep post DEFCON so and please keep me

1024
00:39:35,730 --> 00:39:42,960
your business card so I can see how I've

1025
00:39:37,350 --> 00:39:46,310
cocked it up sir at the end please so

1026
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:48,570
looking at the list of tools and the

1027
00:39:46,310 --> 00:39:50,700
what was up on the dash there right

1028
00:39:48,570 --> 00:39:54,360
Instagram a lot of these legacy

1029
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:56,970
platforms that exists right so now with

1030
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:59,450
the prevalence of Mastodon plural

1031
00:39:56,970 --> 00:40:01,439
these explosive fat averse networks

1032
00:39:59,450 --> 00:40:03,210
everything there was single party

1033
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:04,920
controlled and there's a way to stamp it

1034
00:40:03,210 --> 00:40:07,260
down through some sort of order or

1035
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:13,170
something right how do you address

1036
00:40:07,260 --> 00:40:16,350
something like that what's the model so

1037
00:40:13,170 --> 00:40:18,840
that yeah it's it's very easy to kind of

1038
00:40:16,350 --> 00:40:20,640
fall into these stovepipes and only

1039
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:22,740
consider your platform that's why we

1040
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:24,060
wouldn't stand up the ice ow so that the

1041
00:40:22,740 --> 00:40:25,740
various social media companies and

1042
00:40:24,060 --> 00:40:28,680
corporations can share threat indicators

1043
00:40:25,740 --> 00:40:29,939
and be on the lookout it's this is not

1044
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:31,230
going to be a silver bullet problem it's

1045
00:40:29,940 --> 00:40:34,800
gonna be a thousand bullet problem

1046
00:40:31,230 --> 00:40:36,630
so the corporation's need to monitor the

1047
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:38,340
health of the discussion for their

1048
00:40:36,630 --> 00:40:40,200
social media the social media companies

1049
00:40:38,340 --> 00:40:41,940
need to do their but the government

1050
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:44,040
needs to be able to fund these kind of

1051
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:46,320
efforts where information sharing can

1052
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:48,690
happen and really we need help from the

1053
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:50,610
hackers to educate the rest of the

1054
00:40:48,690 --> 00:40:53,010
community and the rest of the populace

1055
00:40:50,610 --> 00:40:55,700
and how to be more skeptical hackers are

1056
00:40:53,010 --> 00:40:58,380
great at this we don't believe anything

1057
00:40:55,700 --> 00:41:01,379
but the rest of the the rest of the

1058
00:40:58,380 --> 00:41:03,120
populace believes what they follow and

1059
00:41:01,380 --> 00:41:06,960
we've all got biases hackers included

1060
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:09,000
and so when you're in your own echo

1061
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:13,380
chamber and every message is you get via

1062
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:15,930
every channel reinforces your bias it is

1063
00:41:13,380 --> 00:41:18,090
really really hard to have good civil

1064
00:41:15,930 --> 00:41:20,879
discourse and listen to the other side

1065
00:41:18,090 --> 00:41:24,470
and that kind of toxicity is leading to

1066
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:24,470
serious problems in our democracy

1067
00:41:25,250 --> 00:41:30,770
sir in some of your analyses is there

1068
00:41:28,609 --> 00:41:33,920
kind of a mathematical limit of how much

1069
00:41:30,770 --> 00:41:36,080
information people can absorb when you

1070
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:37,910
get all these different things in and

1071
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:41,210
out of your echo chamber at what point

1072
00:41:37,910 --> 00:41:42,109
do just people saturate that's that's a

1073
00:41:41,210 --> 00:41:44,450
great question

1074
00:41:42,109 --> 00:41:46,340
that's a cognitive theory question I'll

1075
00:41:44,450 --> 00:41:47,359
take a first stab at that the cognitive

1076
00:41:46,340 --> 00:41:50,599
theorists deal with it

1077
00:41:47,359 --> 00:41:52,940
so the limits of information that can be

1078
00:41:50,599 --> 00:41:54,380
taken in aren't well known it's not so

1079
00:41:52,940 --> 00:41:57,530
much a limit of how much information you

1080
00:41:54,380 --> 00:41:59,960
can take it's having a variety of

1081
00:41:57,530 --> 00:42:02,810
information if you only get information

1082
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:04,640
from one side of a discussion and that's

1083
00:42:02,810 --> 00:42:06,529
all you get it's very hard to have a

1084
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:11,480
balanced view and to have that public

1085
00:42:06,530 --> 00:42:13,070
discourse so think of a an analogy where

1086
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:15,530
there's questions of public health and

1087
00:42:13,070 --> 00:42:18,440
then there's questions of public health

1088
00:42:15,530 --> 00:42:20,240
security there are a lot of questions

1089
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:21,410
about public health right now from the

1090
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:23,569
point of view of the attention economy

1091
00:42:21,410 --> 00:42:24,980
there groups like the Center for Humane

1092
00:42:23,570 --> 00:42:26,810
Technology and the time well-spent

1093
00:42:24,980 --> 00:42:29,900
movement in Silicon Valley a lot of

1094
00:42:26,810 --> 00:42:32,779
people who aren't the ones running the

1095
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:34,580
platforms are thinking a lot about you

1096
00:42:32,780 --> 00:42:36,680
know the overload of attention and

1097
00:42:34,580 --> 00:42:41,270
divided attention and exploitation of

1098
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:42,740
attention extractive economies where the

1099
00:42:41,270 --> 00:42:44,599
attention is the resource being

1100
00:42:42,740 --> 00:42:46,790
extracted and we're kind of at the point

1101
00:42:44,599 --> 00:42:50,180
where it's like tight sale we're like

1102
00:42:46,790 --> 00:42:53,330
fracking people's attention now so that

1103
00:42:50,180 --> 00:42:55,520
that's a public health problem and there

1104
00:42:53,330 --> 00:42:57,440
are a lot of people working to raise

1105
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:59,089
awareness of that and try to talk about

1106
00:42:57,440 --> 00:43:00,890
that you know now like even your phone

1107
00:42:59,089 --> 00:43:03,470
probably has a like hey here's how much

1108
00:43:00,890 --> 00:43:05,569
screen time you had last week so when

1109
00:43:03,470 --> 00:43:08,540
you have a weakness in public health

1110
00:43:05,570 --> 00:43:11,390
then you're vulnerable to somebody

1111
00:43:08,540 --> 00:43:12,800
introducing some sort of attack agent

1112
00:43:11,390 --> 00:43:14,240
and that's kind of what we're talking

1113
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:16,550
about here there's the public health

1114
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:18,169
question which people are kind of

1115
00:43:16,550 --> 00:43:21,740
already doing a good job of talking

1116
00:43:18,170 --> 00:43:24,380
about and then what builds on that is

1117
00:43:21,740 --> 00:43:26,839
that that makes the system weak and

1118
00:43:24,380 --> 00:43:30,099
vulnerable to an intentional attack so I

1119
00:43:26,839 --> 00:43:32,390
the the what you were saying about

1120
00:43:30,099 --> 00:43:34,970
overloaded and divided attention is

1121
00:43:32,390 --> 00:43:36,770
critical to this and fortunately it's

1122
00:43:34,970 --> 00:43:38,359
also important in its own right

1123
00:43:36,770 --> 00:43:40,520
and there's whole other groups of people

1124
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:44,030
that are working on that element of the

1125
00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:45,230
puzzle directly which I hope you'll look

1126
00:43:44,030 --> 00:43:46,310
into some of those names I just

1127
00:43:45,230 --> 00:43:51,620
mentioned because they're really good

1128
00:43:46,310 --> 00:43:53,000
people also you use the tools on your

1129
00:43:51,620 --> 00:43:55,759
phone that tell you how much screen time

1130
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:57,950
you spend it sir you talked about the

1131
00:43:55,760 --> 00:44:00,320
Overton Window one of the things that we

1132
00:43:57,950 --> 00:44:02,600
saw in the misinformation campaign in

1133
00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:04,370
the 2016 election was that the Overton

1134
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:06,980
Window was pulled in multiple different

1135
00:44:04,370 --> 00:44:09,620
directions at the same time is there a

1136
00:44:06,980 --> 00:44:12,590
breakdown of that theory if the Overton

1137
00:44:09,620 --> 00:44:14,890
Window is stretched all the way out does

1138
00:44:12,590 --> 00:44:17,780
it pop like a balloon or something

1139
00:44:14,890 --> 00:44:19,819
well that would essentially be what you

1140
00:44:17,780 --> 00:44:22,880
just said it would be the sort of

1141
00:44:19,820 --> 00:44:24,170
formalization of I think it was the very

1142
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:26,500
first question about what if no one

1143
00:44:24,170 --> 00:44:29,990
believes anything anymore if there's no

1144
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:33,830
common shared narrative that people have

1145
00:44:29,990 --> 00:44:35,479
if there's no shared knowledge then then

1146
00:44:33,830 --> 00:44:36,890
the concept of the Overton Window you're

1147
00:44:35,480 --> 00:44:38,270
right that it's broken it doesn't make

1148
00:44:36,890 --> 00:44:40,009
any sense anymore because everybody's

1149
00:44:38,270 --> 00:44:41,960
not on the same page and you can't even

1150
00:44:40,010 --> 00:44:46,400
say what messages are acceptable and

1151
00:44:41,960 --> 00:44:48,080
what messages aren't acceptable and as I

1152
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:51,290
said before yes that's a really big

1153
00:44:48,080 --> 00:44:53,330
problem the other problem that goes with

1154
00:44:51,290 --> 00:44:54,800
that it lists I'll just briefly address

1155
00:44:53,330 --> 00:44:56,900
the political problem so Bruce Schneier

1156
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:59,360
wrote a fantastic blog talking about

1157
00:44:56,900 --> 00:45:02,090
this and one of the things that he said

1158
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:04,040
was in order for democracy to work we

1159
00:45:02,090 --> 00:45:06,500
need this common political knowledge and

1160
00:45:04,040 --> 00:45:08,330
the common political knowledge is we all

1161
00:45:06,500 --> 00:45:11,420
have to believe in the legitimacy of our

1162
00:45:08,330 --> 00:45:14,810
rulers we have to understand how the

1163
00:45:11,420 --> 00:45:17,990
government works and we have to be

1164
00:45:14,810 --> 00:45:19,670
willing to have this other political

1165
00:45:17,990 --> 00:45:21,979
knowledge that's contested where we

1166
00:45:19,670 --> 00:45:24,140
solve our problems so you know any of

1167
00:45:21,980 --> 00:45:25,490
the issues of hey how do we want to do

1168
00:45:24,140 --> 00:45:27,259
Social Security or do we want to do

1169
00:45:25,490 --> 00:45:29,120
Social Security or social medicine or

1170
00:45:27,260 --> 00:45:30,890
not how much government intrusion do we

1171
00:45:29,120 --> 00:45:35,540
want into Social Affairs and vice versa

1172
00:45:30,890 --> 00:45:38,600
and so when you get to stretching the

1173
00:45:35,540 --> 00:45:39,800
bee populace right now it calls into

1174
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:41,600
question we can sit here and we can

1175
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:43,160
argue about votes change or didn't

1176
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:49,038
change what we can't argue is there was

1177
00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:51,140
an attempt to influence the results

1178
00:45:49,039 --> 00:45:52,760
and as in fat attempt there are

1179
00:45:51,140 --> 00:45:54,529
questions about the legitimacy of the

1180
00:45:52,760 --> 00:45:55,970
election there are questions in some

1181
00:45:54,529 --> 00:45:57,440
people's mind about the logistics of the

1182
00:45:55,970 --> 00:45:59,480
rulers there are questions about whether

1183
00:45:57,440 --> 00:46:01,520
or not the election worked and the

1184
00:45:59,480 --> 00:46:05,270
government worked and that's an attack

1185
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:07,038
on the foundations of democracy what's

1186
00:46:05,270 --> 00:46:09,710
interesting here is that it happened

1187
00:46:07,039 --> 00:46:12,200
primarily via social media if this had

1188
00:46:09,710 --> 00:46:15,230
happened via dropping of leaflets in

1189
00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:16,700
Times Square I would hazard the guests

1190
00:46:15,230 --> 00:46:18,289
that we would have had a drastically

1191
00:46:16,700 --> 00:46:21,319
different response from the US

1192
00:46:18,289 --> 00:46:23,329
government and the US populace and so we

1193
00:46:21,319 --> 00:46:25,579
still have to start asking ourselves is

1194
00:46:23,329 --> 00:46:27,200
there a difference should there be a

1195
00:46:25,579 --> 00:46:28,460
difference should we treat them the same

1196
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:31,730
and how should we respond to these

1197
00:46:28,460 --> 00:46:32,990
things so wait hold on I want to add one

1198
00:46:31,730 --> 00:46:34,700
more thing there I want to bring this

1199
00:46:32,990 --> 00:46:37,308
back to the relevance for corporate

1200
00:46:34,700 --> 00:46:39,828
security because you know in the

1201
00:46:37,309 --> 00:46:42,140
narrative that I told I think twenty

1202
00:46:39,829 --> 00:46:44,359
years ago the idea that maybe some sort

1203
00:46:42,140 --> 00:46:47,328
of online fringe conspiracy group would

1204
00:46:44,359 --> 00:46:49,788
end up you know trashing your company

1205
00:46:47,329 --> 00:46:51,410
that nobody I wouldn't have told a story

1206
00:46:49,789 --> 00:46:52,970
like that back then and even if I wrote

1207
00:46:51,410 --> 00:46:54,828
it as a sci-fi story it wouldn't have

1208
00:46:52,970 --> 00:46:57,500
even sounded believable as a sci-fi

1209
00:46:54,829 --> 00:47:01,819
story but it's exactly the the

1210
00:46:57,500 --> 00:47:04,460
fracturing of the the sort of limitation

1211
00:47:01,819 --> 00:47:07,160
of reasonable discourse that makes it

1212
00:47:04,460 --> 00:47:10,730
all too possible I mean there's somebody

1213
00:47:07,160 --> 00:47:13,578
who in fact was a mobster was shot on

1214
00:47:10,730 --> 00:47:15,680
the street just recently like maybe a

1215
00:47:13,579 --> 00:47:17,119
year or two ago and the guy in these

1216
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:18,288
conspiracy theories and he thought he

1217
00:47:17,119 --> 00:47:19,700
was a part of the deep state and he's

1218
00:47:18,289 --> 00:47:21,289
like I'm gonna do a citizen's arrest and

1219
00:47:19,700 --> 00:47:22,520
then the guy tried to fight back and

1220
00:47:21,289 --> 00:47:24,920
then he shot him and then he's dead and

1221
00:47:22,520 --> 00:47:27,740
like it wasn't even political it had

1222
00:47:24,920 --> 00:47:29,450
nothing to do with politics so it's

1223
00:47:27,740 --> 00:47:31,009
actually you know like I said it's

1224
00:47:29,450 --> 00:47:32,660
already happening the conspiracy

1225
00:47:31,010 --> 00:47:34,940
theories anybody can say anything about

1226
00:47:32,660 --> 00:47:38,450
anyone and it can lead to mass

1227
00:47:34,940 --> 00:47:41,450
destructive activity so we are gonna

1228
00:47:38,450 --> 00:47:44,598
have to do something about the fact that

1229
00:47:41,450 --> 00:47:50,710
the boundaries of the window are weak

1230
00:47:44,599 --> 00:47:50,710
now man please

1231
00:47:50,860 --> 00:47:55,490
you have a couple of different actions

1232
00:47:53,330 --> 00:47:57,620
up on your screen that are towards the

1233
00:47:55,490 --> 00:47:59,270
security community but for us trying to

1234
00:47:57,620 --> 00:48:01,700
reach out of that community are there a

1235
00:47:59,270 --> 00:48:04,070
couple of tips or directions moving

1236
00:48:01,700 --> 00:48:07,250
forward we can take for starters since

1237
00:48:04,070 --> 00:48:10,070
we seem to be influencing a much larger

1238
00:48:07,250 --> 00:48:12,230
community a great question thank you for

1239
00:48:10,070 --> 00:48:13,910
that so allow me to correct that

1240
00:48:12,230 --> 00:48:16,160
perception the first thing that each and

1241
00:48:13,910 --> 00:48:19,520
every one of us can do is go outside of

1242
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:21,799
our comfort zones and watch news media

1243
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:25,340
and follow people as social media that

1244
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:26,900
absolutely infuriated us I do it I think

1245
00:48:25,340 --> 00:48:30,680
I have to replace my coffee cup about

1246
00:48:26,900 --> 00:48:33,170
three times a week but what allows me to

1247
00:48:30,680 --> 00:48:34,970
do is understand what the other side of

1248
00:48:33,170 --> 00:48:37,010
the issue is saying I don't have to

1249
00:48:34,970 --> 00:48:38,270
agree with it but at least I understand

1250
00:48:37,010 --> 00:48:40,340
what they're saying that allows me to

1251
00:48:38,270 --> 00:48:41,750
have a more balanced approach when I

1252
00:48:40,340 --> 00:48:44,260
have that discussion I can

1253
00:48:41,750 --> 00:48:46,520
systematically try to convince them that

1254
00:48:44,260 --> 00:48:48,080
they're looking at it wrong or they can

1255
00:48:46,520 --> 00:48:49,790
systematically convince them that I'm

1256
00:48:48,080 --> 00:48:52,880
convince me that I'm looking at a

1257
00:48:49,790 --> 00:48:55,220
problem the other one is when you look

1258
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:57,200
at am it a man is actually there for all

1259
00:48:55,220 --> 00:48:59,149
of the communities it is not just a

1260
00:48:57,200 --> 00:49:01,009
technical community so please go take a

1261
00:48:59,150 --> 00:49:02,420
look there are things in there for

1262
00:49:01,010 --> 00:49:04,100
journalists there are things in there

1263
00:49:02,420 --> 00:49:05,900
for academics there are things in there

1264
00:49:04,100 --> 00:49:08,240
for industry there are things in there

1265
00:49:05,900 --> 00:49:09,950
for the general populace so it is

1266
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:11,779
absolutely there so that all of the

1267
00:49:09,950 --> 00:49:13,580
communities that we need to help us work

1268
00:49:11,780 --> 00:49:15,890
on this misinformation and influence

1269
00:49:13,580 --> 00:49:17,840
problem can contribute because we need

1270
00:49:15,890 --> 00:49:19,640
all of your views this is not a

1271
00:49:17,840 --> 00:49:24,190
technical problem that we can solve a

1272
00:49:19,640 --> 00:49:28,100
technology alone and just to amplify the

1273
00:49:24,190 --> 00:49:29,330
in the same vein the the idea of you

1274
00:49:28,100 --> 00:49:31,370
know following people that you disagree

1275
00:49:29,330 --> 00:49:34,730
with and replacing your coffee cup every

1276
00:49:31,370 --> 00:49:38,210
week it even just consider for a moment

1277
00:49:34,730 --> 00:49:40,070
even if you are right about everything

1278
00:49:38,210 --> 00:49:41,750
which I'm sure every single one of you

1279
00:49:40,070 --> 00:49:44,180
here is right about everything in your

1280
00:49:41,750 --> 00:49:47,000
beliefs are all the best beliefs even if

1281
00:49:44,180 --> 00:49:49,730
that's true once you start to think of

1282
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:52,130
this as a systems problem a hacking

1283
00:49:49,730 --> 00:49:53,870
problem and even a security problem then

1284
00:49:52,130 --> 00:49:55,340
at that point you take a step back and

1285
00:49:53,870 --> 00:49:58,730
you think well obviously I need to

1286
00:49:55,340 --> 00:50:00,290
understand what are the narratives that

1287
00:49:58,730 --> 00:50:02,870
are a part of the

1288
00:50:00,290 --> 00:50:04,970
attack you know it's not a matter of

1289
00:50:02,870 --> 00:50:07,069
like well those people are so stupid why

1290
00:50:04,970 --> 00:50:08,629
would I even care what they think it's

1291
00:50:07,070 --> 00:50:10,310
an attack on a system and you have to

1292
00:50:08,630 --> 00:50:13,430
understand what the attack on the system

1293
00:50:10,310 --> 00:50:15,440
is you don't even have to admit that you

1294
00:50:13,430 --> 00:50:17,690
might be wrong about something because I

1295
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:19,010
mean I can't admit that I might be wrong

1296
00:50:17,690 --> 00:50:21,170
about something but you still need to

1297
00:50:19,010 --> 00:50:24,860
understand what are the attacks on the

1298
00:50:21,170 --> 00:50:26,360
system okay if there are no other

1299
00:50:24,860 --> 00:50:27,520
questions thanks so much for your

1300
00:50:26,360 --> 00:50:31,389
attention thanks for coming

1301
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:31,389
[Applause]
