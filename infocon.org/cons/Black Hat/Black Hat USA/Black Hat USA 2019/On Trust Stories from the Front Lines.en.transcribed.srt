welcome to on trust stories from the

2
00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:10,019
front line in lagoon GHI by Jamil far

3
00:00:06,779 --> 00:00:12,809
she during the question session please

4
00:00:10,019 --> 00:00:23,070
use the microphones in the aisles and

5
00:00:12,809 --> 00:00:26,130
with that let us welcome our speaker hey

6
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:28,590
y'all are you doing this morning good

7
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:31,979
I appreciate you braving the heat and

8
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:34,019
maybe hangovers as well depending on how

9
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:37,350
late you stayed out last night to come

10
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:38,640
for this talk I'm gonna talk about on

11
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:40,020
trust and then we're gonna go through

12
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:43,110
some of the experiences that I've had

13
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:48,120
throughout my career leading up to the

14
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:50,370
Equifax situation when to start off I

15
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:53,250
want to talk about a day that I will not

16
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:56,669
ever forget and that day was September

17
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:59,399
7th 2017 started off like any other

18
00:00:56,670 --> 00:01:01,440
normal day but it wasn't long after I

19
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:04,790
got into the office that morning that I

20
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:07,320
get a phone call coming from my CEO and

21
00:01:04,790 --> 00:01:08,070
immediately starts grilling me on a

22
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:11,570
variety of things

23
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:14,039
hey 150 million records compromised

24
00:01:11,570 --> 00:01:16,830
what's the data sensitivity do we have

25
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:18,869
any or connection what are the risks

26
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:21,390
that we have it was a it was a pretty

27
00:01:18,869 --> 00:01:22,530
trying time and as a Cecil you never

28
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:24,420
really want to get that phone call to

29
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:26,880
begin with right

30
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:28,890
and then that led to the next discussion

31
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:32,039
which was board members asking the same

32
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:34,650
type of types of questions the team you

33
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:35,909
know getting into a frenzy and and you

34
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:38,070
know running all over the place to try

35
00:01:35,909 --> 00:01:41,070
to get as many answers as they can to

36
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:43,820
the situation so the net of it was it

37
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:47,639
was it was a very chaotic and crazy time

38
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:50,039
September 7th 2017 what's really crazy

39
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:53,159
about it though is that I was not at

40
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:55,560
Equifax at this time I was at that

41
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:58,619
company with the big orange sign the

42
00:01:55,560 --> 00:02:02,159
mecca for do-it-yourselfers I was at

43
00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:03,840
Home Depot and despite this despite the

44
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:05,939
fact that we had had our own breach in

45
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:09,750
2015 which I was in the middle of

46
00:02:05,939 --> 00:02:13,530
driving the transformation for the

47
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:15,450
Equifax breach caused us a lot of pain

48
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:18,380
why because Equifax is one of our

49
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:21,450
customers so from a customer perspective

50
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:25,140
my level of trust in that organization

51
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:27,000
was meaningfully impacted as was for all

52
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:28,890
of the other employees boards of

53
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,730
directors and so forth throughout the

54
00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:35,220
organization but it wasn't just that it

55
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:38,369
wasn't just their customer aspect

56
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:39,900
personally I was a victim myself so my

57
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:42,390
information was compromised during that

58
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:45,540
breach but more importantly to me was

59
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:47,399
the fact that my daughter who had not

60
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:49,650
too long before that had just received

61
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:50,970
her first little Social Security number

62
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:53,400
and I you know it's pretty cool little

63
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:55,050
time to see this little thing and you

64
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:56,700
think oh she's like a real person now

65
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:59,250
and one of the first things I thought

66
00:02:56,700 --> 00:03:01,079
was my gosh this breach is gonna impact

67
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:03,269
this and her credentials or her

68
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:05,880
information is already compromised so it

69
00:03:03,269 --> 00:03:09,060
was it was truly impactful and my level

70
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:10,739
of trust in the organization wasn't was

71
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:14,190
meaningfully impacted as a result of

72
00:03:10,739 --> 00:03:15,989
that today I'm sure that many of you in

73
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:19,799
this room have had the have had similar

74
00:03:15,989 --> 00:03:22,680
stories and had similar impacts as I did

75
00:03:19,799 --> 00:03:24,329
but the impacts weren't just weren't

76
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:27,600
just as it relates to the personal and

77
00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:30,299
to the customer Equifax was meaningfully

78
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:33,329
impacted as well so right out of the

79
00:03:30,299 --> 00:03:38,489
gate you have a 40% loss in your market

80
00:03:33,329 --> 00:03:41,730
cap you have the CEO the CSO the CTO all

81
00:03:38,489 --> 00:03:43,380
gone from the organization you make an

82
00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:45,570
incremental investment of one and a

83
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:47,940
quarter billion dollars it's a lot of

84
00:03:45,570 --> 00:03:49,290
money to be able to reinvest in the

85
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:52,650
technology and security of the

86
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:55,410
organization and then you have all of

87
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:59,579
the scrutiny and so we dealt with a

88
00:03:55,410 --> 00:04:02,340
whole host of investigations as a result

89
00:03:59,579 --> 00:04:06,560
of the breach itself one such

90
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:10,650
investigation led me earlier this year

91
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:14,250
myself my CEO was in February led us to

92
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:15,750
Washington DC to the Dirksen building up

93
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:18,810
there and it was for congressional

94
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:21,930
testimony for the Senate permanent

95
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:25,260
Subcommittee on investigations and when

96
00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:26,340
I'm in this meeting you know the you

97
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:27,930
sitting there

98
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:29,400
at the at the desk and you've got all

99
00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:31,530
these cameras in front of you and the

100
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:33,330
reporters and stuff and you look up and

101
00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:34,888
they the way they set these things up is

102
00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:36,750
pretty intimidating so although you know

103
00:04:34,889 --> 00:04:38,850
the Senators are sitting above you

104
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:42,330
looking down but right out of the gate

105
00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:44,580
for first question I get is how many

106
00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:45,990
certificates were expired in 2017

107
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:47,609
all right so they're looking ended up

108
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:49,949
into the past and trying to piece that

109
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:51,270
together the next question I get is what

110
00:04:49,949 --> 00:04:54,150
have you done to improve your patching

111
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:55,139
processes since we believe patching was

112
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:56,400
a critical weakness for your

113
00:04:55,139 --> 00:04:59,370
organization

114
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:02,280
and then another one would be you know

115
00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:04,169
if you had an outstanding asset

116
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:05,940
inventory would you have been able to

117
00:05:04,169 --> 00:05:07,859
stop this breach from occurring right so

118
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:10,620
going into the speculative piece now

119
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:12,180
these questions are all meaningful and I

120
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:15,180
think they're all fine and quite frankly

121
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:18,800
in my role I've I get these questions

122
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:22,020
from the media from the regulators from

123
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:23,970
Shooter our insurance underwriters from

124
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:26,419
customers and so forth so these aren't

125
00:05:23,970 --> 00:05:29,280
bad questions and they're fairly common

126
00:05:26,419 --> 00:05:32,490
the I think the key thing though is are

127
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:34,080
they the right questions does it does it

128
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:35,970
really matter when you talk about these

129
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:38,340
specific controls does it really get to

130
00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:40,950
the heart of what's really going on

131
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:44,460
within our industry as a whole and to

132
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:46,770
answer that I believe that I figured

133
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:48,570
this out far earlier in my career it

134
00:05:46,770 --> 00:05:51,030
wasn't learning this at Equifax I didn't

135
00:05:48,570 --> 00:05:53,789
learn it at Home Depot it actually goes

136
00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:56,369
back to my first job out of outside

137
00:05:53,789 --> 00:06:02,460
after I finished college and it was it

138
00:05:56,370 --> 00:06:04,979
was at NASA and so in 2003 2003 I'm at

139
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:07,289
NASA and we have what I believe to be

140
00:06:04,979 --> 00:06:09,599
the greatest crisis I've ever faced

141
00:06:07,289 --> 00:06:12,510
within an organization and it wasn't a

142
00:06:09,599 --> 00:06:16,169
breach more than a breach it was the

143
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:18,780
2003 shuttle Columbia disaster where we

144
00:06:16,169 --> 00:06:22,200
lost seven outstanding individuals by

145
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:25,109
virtue of that of that event now in the

146
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:27,210
wake of that event they put together an

147
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:28,950
investigation board and they went

148
00:06:27,210 --> 00:06:30,299
through all of the different causes and

149
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:32,430
and identified all the different

150
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:34,169
weaknesses within there within the the

151
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:37,200
situation to be able to identify the

152
00:06:34,169 --> 00:06:39,210
root cause and so the

153
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:42,210
the initial outcome that's okay look you

154
00:06:39,210 --> 00:06:43,770
you're getting ready to they're getting

155
00:06:42,210 --> 00:06:45,510
ready to launch as you're going through

156
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:47,849
that process you have a piece of foam

157
00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:51,510
insulation falls off the external tank

158
00:06:47,850 --> 00:06:54,030
hits the left wing damaging it and then

159
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:56,070
later on upon reentry because of that

160
00:06:54,030 --> 00:06:57,690
damaged wing you get a excess heat which

161
00:06:56,070 --> 00:06:59,640
then cascades throughout the shuttle and

162
00:06:57,690 --> 00:07:01,650
disintegrates upon reentry

163
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:04,560
it was terrible and so this is all

164
00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:07,109
documented in that report but there is

165
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:08,550
one very very important conclusion that

166
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:10,080
they make in that report that I think is

167
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:13,350
extraordinarily relevant to all of us

168
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:14,700
here today and what they said I think if

169
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:17,250
there's anything you take away from this

170
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:20,670
talk like just remember this what they

171
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:24,150
said was at NASA an accident was

172
00:07:20,670 --> 00:07:24,930
inevitable so think about that for a

173
00:07:24,150 --> 00:07:26,849
minute

174
00:07:24,930 --> 00:07:28,590
it was inevitable didn't matter if it

175
00:07:26,850 --> 00:07:30,930
was the Columbia or was going to be the

176
00:07:28,590 --> 00:07:32,400
Atlantis for the next launch didn't

177
00:07:30,930 --> 00:07:34,500
matter if it was because of foam

178
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:38,310
insulation or because of some propulsion

179
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:40,680
issue an accident was inevitable why was

180
00:07:38,310 --> 00:07:44,220
it inevitable well they said it directly

181
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:46,890
in their organizational structure and

182
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:48,750
decision processes were such that it was

183
00:07:46,890 --> 00:07:50,640
going to happen something bad was going

184
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:52,860
to happen and what does that speak to

185
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:54,630
that speaks to the culture of the

186
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:56,550
organization does it speak to the

187
00:07:54,630 --> 00:07:58,770
specific controls it speaks to the

188
00:07:56,550 --> 00:08:00,360
culture and I think that's a critical

189
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:01,650
piece as we look at the breaches and we

190
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:04,620
look at the landscape that we're seeing

191
00:08:01,650 --> 00:08:05,940
today if we focus just on the individual

192
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:11,160
controls that failed I think we're

193
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:13,560
missing the bigger picture so so a few

194
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:15,930
weeks or a few months ago I was I was

195
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:18,570
talking to a CEO of a major financial

196
00:08:15,930 --> 00:08:22,080
institution you guys Jemile you know I'm

197
00:08:18,570 --> 00:08:24,150
not a technical guy so how how will I

198
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:26,609
know if I have an effective security

199
00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:28,080
organization and I think it's a great

200
00:08:26,610 --> 00:08:29,550
question honestly and I think it's one

201
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:32,340
of those one of these things that as a

202
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:34,140
security leader and many of us have to

203
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:36,419
deal with consistently is trying to sort

204
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:39,330
of bridge that divide between the

205
00:08:36,419 --> 00:08:41,549
technical aspects and communicating it

206
00:08:39,330 --> 00:08:43,560
to a non-technical audience so what I

207
00:08:41,549 --> 00:08:45,630
told him was there's five things I think

208
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:47,079
that really matter to be able to help

209
00:08:45,630 --> 00:08:49,240
too

210
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:52,540
to identify whether you're going to have

211
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:55,660
a successful security program or not the

212
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:58,240
first one is is your head of security or

213
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:59,980
si so are they positioned in the

214
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:01,930
organization such that they have the

215
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:04,630
ability to influence the entire

216
00:09:01,930 --> 00:09:06,189
enterprise the reason this is important

217
00:09:04,630 --> 00:09:08,439
because security is everybody's

218
00:09:06,190 --> 00:09:09,700
responsibility if it's just the security

219
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:12,010
team that's doing security than you're

220
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:13,180
bound to fail and you need that you need

221
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:14,230
that level of authority to be able to

222
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:17,890
push down throughout the entire

223
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:20,100
enterprise the second one is do does the

224
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:22,569
head of security have regular

225
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:24,610
interaction and communications with the

226
00:09:22,570 --> 00:09:26,350
board of directors now this is essential

227
00:09:24,610 --> 00:09:27,850
because you need to be able to manage up

228
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:29,560
you need to be able to communicate what

229
00:09:27,850 --> 00:09:30,430
those key risks are otherwise they're

230
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:32,380
going to get buried and they're not

231
00:09:30,430 --> 00:09:35,859
going to be addressed to the degree that

232
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:38,140
they should the third one is about

233
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:40,480
incentives and there's a lot of

234
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:42,399
organizations out there that's sort of

235
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:44,410
check the box as it relates to to

236
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:46,029
security it you either you have nothing

237
00:09:44,410 --> 00:09:47,800
or some organizations will have sort of

238
00:09:46,029 --> 00:09:49,089
part of the annual review process you'll

239
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:51,550
have a little blurb in there about

240
00:09:49,089 --> 00:09:53,290
security doesn't really tie into in any

241
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:55,209
kind of meaningful economic incentives

242
00:09:53,290 --> 00:09:56,890
the organization's I think they're doing

243
00:09:55,209 --> 00:09:58,750
this really well are the ones that have

244
00:09:56,890 --> 00:10:00,189
taken security and aligned it

245
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:01,990
economically from a performance

246
00:10:00,190 --> 00:10:03,550
standpoint just like almost all

247
00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:05,860
organizations do as it relates to

248
00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:07,870
top-line growth or bottom line growth or

249
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:09,220
your margins or your EBIT ah these

250
00:10:07,870 --> 00:10:11,230
things are essential and they're

251
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:13,959
critical and so if you tie that economic

252
00:10:11,230 --> 00:10:15,730
impact back in to the performance of

253
00:10:13,959 --> 00:10:18,670
your security program it puts you in a

254
00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:22,089
far better place the next one is is

255
00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:23,829
crisis management are you doing

256
00:10:22,089 --> 00:10:25,630
consistent crisis management exercises

257
00:10:23,829 --> 00:10:29,439
with the executive leadership team and

258
00:10:25,630 --> 00:10:31,240
the board of directors if you're not if

259
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:32,500
you're not what it tells me is that you

260
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:34,839
don't think a breach is ever going to

261
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:36,370
happen right it's the same reason that I

262
00:10:34,839 --> 00:10:38,620
put on a seatbelt every single time I

263
00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:40,029
get into a car it's because I know it's

264
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:41,290
possible that I'm gonna get an accident

265
00:10:40,029 --> 00:10:43,120
and I want to do at least the minimum

266
00:10:41,290 --> 00:10:43,719
amount to ensure that I'm protecting

267
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:46,149
myself

268
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:47,769
if the organizations aren't testing

269
00:10:46,149 --> 00:10:49,660
these things then they fundamentally

270
00:10:47,769 --> 00:10:51,880
don't believe it's going to happen to

271
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:55,689
them and as we know it can happen to

272
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:59,200
anyone at any time and the final one is

273
00:10:55,690 --> 00:11:01,480
is ties back to risk management

274
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:04,899
have you has your organization ever

275
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:07,630
halted or delayed a critical enterprise

276
00:11:04,899 --> 00:11:10,899
initiative because of security or

277
00:11:07,630 --> 00:11:12,820
privacy this is a critical one because

278
00:11:10,899 --> 00:11:14,980
what it speaks to is the fact that if

279
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:17,589
you have done this you have the right

280
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:19,510
governance processes in place to be able

281
00:11:17,589 --> 00:11:21,820
to to be able to identify these risks

282
00:11:19,510 --> 00:11:24,819
and escalate them and it means that your

283
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:28,300
management the CEO the leadership team

284
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:29,920
whomever has the conviction to actually

285
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:34,000
do something about it they have the

286
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:36,430
conviction to to not take advantage of

287
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,440
an immediate opportunity that's you know

288
00:11:36,430 --> 00:11:40,899
gonna give you maybe an X an incremental

289
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:43,060
dollar of revenue and instead do the

290
00:11:40,899 --> 00:11:45,250
right thing and focus on the risk to the

291
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:49,569
organization so I think these are all

292
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:51,399
absolutely critical pieces now think

293
00:11:49,570 --> 00:11:54,100
about your organization's and tell me

294
00:11:51,399 --> 00:11:55,930
whether you check the box on all five of

295
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:58,389
those things it's likely that you're

296
00:11:55,930 --> 00:11:59,769
it's likely that you don't because

297
00:11:58,389 --> 00:12:03,250
that's just a state of our environment

298
00:11:59,769 --> 00:12:05,769
today but if you do my argument is even

299
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:07,180
with a mediocre security team if you

300
00:12:05,769 --> 00:12:09,279
have all five of those things checked

301
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:11,380
you have a far better chance of success

302
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:13,360
you can have the best security team ever

303
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:15,790
but if you don't have those five things

304
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:16,810
on top of you in place then the

305
00:12:15,790 --> 00:12:18,670
likelihood that you're going to be

306
00:12:16,810 --> 00:12:20,229
successful as a team is pretty darn low

307
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:21,490
no matter how good you are because

308
00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:25,209
you're not gonna have the ability to be

309
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:28,019
able to drive change now if you look at

310
00:12:25,209 --> 00:12:30,579
the studies today most studies will say

311
00:12:28,019 --> 00:12:32,290
one of the top three things that any

312
00:12:30,579 --> 00:12:34,359
organization that any Board of Directors

313
00:12:32,290 --> 00:12:35,079
or CEO cares about is gonna be

314
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:36,880
cybersecurity

315
00:12:35,079 --> 00:12:39,099
it's crazy I mean with all the

316
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:40,779
geopolitical risks with the competitive

317
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:44,470
challenges that organizations have with

318
00:12:40,779 --> 00:12:46,689
the labor labor issues cyber security

319
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:48,760
consistently reaches the one of the top

320
00:12:46,690 --> 00:12:51,069
three things so everyone says that it's

321
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:53,110
really important right but what really

322
00:12:51,069 --> 00:12:55,719
matters to me is what what are you gonna

323
00:12:53,110 --> 00:12:57,610
do about it it's easy to talk it's easy

324
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:59,160
to say a cyber key to me up and I have

325
00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:01,149
privacy keeps me up at night but but

326
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:02,819
actually doing something about it

327
00:13:01,149 --> 00:13:06,430
putting some of these pieces in place

328
00:13:02,819 --> 00:13:07,899
takes effort and as a result what we're

329
00:13:06,430 --> 00:13:09,579
what we're seeing is a lot of people

330
00:13:07,899 --> 00:13:11,380
talking about things but not actually

331
00:13:09,579 --> 00:13:12,819
doing them and so there's this thing

332
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:14,860
called Sadie

333
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:16,840
that we've implemented at our company

334
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:18,430
and it comes from our CEO when he when

335
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:20,320
he started we start about the same time

336
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:22,359
after the breach and he's like look say

337
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:23,560
do is absolutely essential we can talk

338
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:26,350
all we want but if we say something

339
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:28,900
we've got to deliver on it and it's that

340
00:13:26,350 --> 00:13:30,970
level of action that I think drives the

341
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:32,410
the meaningful level of progress that

342
00:13:30,970 --> 00:13:34,390
we've seen and I think if more companies

343
00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:37,420
chose to do that we wouldn't be in the

344
00:13:34,390 --> 00:13:43,210
situation in many cases that we are that

345
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:46,060
we are to that now it's equally

346
00:13:43,210 --> 00:13:46,960
important to note that the environment

347
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:49,540
is just getting more and more

348
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:51,640
challenging right every organization is

349
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:54,670
critically tied into technology and

350
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:56,650
they're truly relying on technology and

351
00:13:54,670 --> 00:13:58,449
as we all know you know technology

352
00:13:56,650 --> 00:14:01,060
underpins virtually everything within

353
00:13:58,450 --> 00:14:03,670
organizations nowadays and technology is

354
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:05,380
inherently insecure I mean you can have

355
00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:06,790
something that's that has zero

356
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:09,360
weaknesses today and I guarantee you

357
00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:12,400
tomorrow it will have something right a

358
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:13,810
couple that with the reliance on data

359
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:16,090
that we have and you have a perfect

360
00:14:13,810 --> 00:14:17,890
storm where you've got this reliance on

361
00:14:16,090 --> 00:14:19,810
technology or you have all these massive

362
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:22,000
amounts of data being created and so we

363
00:14:19,810 --> 00:14:25,000
become infinitely attractive targets all

364
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:28,900
of us to the bad guys and then you marry

365
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:30,700
up a new dynamic privacy something that

366
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:32,410
consumers in general I think for the

367
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:35,110
longest time have been pretty apathetic

368
00:14:32,410 --> 00:14:36,880
about are now starting to actually care

369
00:14:35,110 --> 00:14:38,980
and as a result you have regulations and

370
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:41,439
regulators coming in to be able to drive

371
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:43,840
that as well so it's only going to

372
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:47,380
continue to get harder for us to be

373
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:49,630
successful now let me tell you a story

374
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:53,730
of for me that was extraordinarily

375
00:14:49,630 --> 00:14:55,720
difficult I was at Los Alamos National

376
00:14:53,730 --> 00:14:57,790
Laboratories and I was the CEO there

377
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:59,350
several years back and and for those of

378
00:14:57,790 --> 00:15:01,959
you don't know it's a it's a nuclear

379
00:14:59,350 --> 00:15:05,100
weapons laboratory and so obviously our

380
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:08,050
risk tolerance is extraordinarily low

381
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:10,230
then you face some of the most advanced

382
00:15:08,050 --> 00:15:14,079
threats there are that are out there and

383
00:15:10,230 --> 00:15:16,120
one day one day we got hit and the

384
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:20,140
adversary penetrated our perimeter and

385
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:21,760
so they got in now fortunately for us we

386
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:23,620
were able to watch them as they came in

387
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:26,020
and we were able to to

388
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:27,400
to do some meaningful analysis and and

389
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:29,140
for those of you don't know in

390
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:30,579
organisations like this often times you

391
00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:31,810
don't want to just kick them out you

392
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:33,580
want to monitor them and try to learn

393
00:15:31,810 --> 00:15:35,890
from them to try to understand sources

394
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:38,050
and stuff like that and so we do and we

395
00:15:35,890 --> 00:15:39,970
after analysis we identify that there

396
00:15:38,050 --> 00:15:41,439
was multiple teams coming after us you

397
00:15:39,970 --> 00:15:45,910
did they were running different shifts

398
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:48,070
we isolated the the origin of those

399
00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:50,020
attacks and who the threat actors were

400
00:15:48,070 --> 00:15:52,150
and eventually they got far enough into

401
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:53,800
the organization that we said okay now

402
00:15:52,150 --> 00:15:55,930
we're going to too much risk we're gonna

403
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:57,520
we're gonna kick these guys out so we

404
00:15:55,930 --> 00:16:00,579
did that and you know wipe their hands

405
00:15:57,520 --> 00:16:02,380
of it and that was a good news story the

406
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:04,180
next morning though I get a phone call

407
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:07,240
from a peer of mine at a different

408
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:09,339
laboratory and he says Jamil can you

409
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:11,950
like we've been we've been popped can

410
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:13,720
you please send some of your cyber folks

411
00:16:11,950 --> 00:16:15,100
over here to help us help us out with

412
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:17,770
the situation and of course I'm like

413
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:19,390
sure great so we send them over there

414
00:16:17,770 --> 00:16:21,460
and what what ended up happening is that

415
00:16:19,390 --> 00:16:23,319
it was so bad they ended up having to

416
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:25,930
pull the plug from the entire internet

417
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:29,470
for the entire laboratory for two full

418
00:16:25,930 --> 00:16:30,550
weeks it was that bad the interesting

419
00:16:29,470 --> 00:16:32,230
thing though is that when we went

420
00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:34,329
through and did the analysis what turns

421
00:16:32,230 --> 00:16:37,300
out happened is that both organizations

422
00:16:34,330 --> 00:16:40,090
mine as well as his or both attacked at

423
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:42,520
the exact same time exact same time and

424
00:16:40,090 --> 00:16:45,070
when we stopped the attacker on our side

425
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:47,020
they diverted all those resources and

426
00:16:45,070 --> 00:16:50,110
essentially amplified that attack on

427
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:52,990
this other organization now this is the

428
00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:55,180
free here this thing about we're this

429
00:16:52,990 --> 00:16:56,170
thing about outrunning the bear right

430
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:57,969
you guys have probably all heard this

431
00:16:56,170 --> 00:16:59,890
you see a bear in the woods you don't

432
00:16:57,970 --> 00:17:01,150
have to outrun it as long as you outrun

433
00:16:59,890 --> 00:17:01,720
your friend they'll get eaten you're

434
00:17:01,150 --> 00:17:05,379
good to go

435
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:08,800
all right yes a great graphical image in

436
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:10,690
your mind so so we've heard this and

437
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:13,409
this was the first time in my career

438
00:17:10,690 --> 00:17:16,930
that I had actually seen direct evidence

439
00:17:13,410 --> 00:17:19,420
supporting this right we after this

440
00:17:16,930 --> 00:17:20,740
occurred I thought geez not only not

441
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:22,540
only did we succeed here because we

442
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:24,579
stopped these guys we actually excelled

443
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:27,490
because they got hit even harder and so

444
00:17:24,579 --> 00:17:28,780
that makes this even better and this was

445
00:17:27,490 --> 00:17:31,870
a huge mistake on my part

446
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:33,790
this is a big mistake because I looked

447
00:17:31,870 --> 00:17:35,649
at the certain the set of outcomes and a

448
00:17:33,790 --> 00:17:36,520
certain set of data points and I

449
00:17:35,650 --> 00:17:39,340
concluded

450
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:43,060
I concluded one thing but what I didn't

451
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:45,310
realize at the time was that neither one

452
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:47,470
of us won right I didn't win I wasn't

453
00:17:45,310 --> 00:17:49,389
successful because they got hit and as a

454
00:17:47,470 --> 00:17:52,180
result of that we both ended up losing

455
00:17:49,390 --> 00:17:55,870
this fight and this is why I think it's

456
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:57,600
so critical that we all work together to

457
00:17:55,870 --> 00:17:59,679
be able to raise the bar for

458
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:01,899
organizations like if you look at things

459
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:03,640
like privacy today you have one or two

460
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:05,770
organizations that maybe weren't doing

461
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:07,720
the right thing and as a result of the

462
00:18:05,770 --> 00:18:10,450
addition result of those of those

463
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:12,490
weaknesses the entire industry

464
00:18:10,450 --> 00:18:14,590
anyone who's related any organization

465
00:18:12,490 --> 00:18:16,690
tied in to privacy has been lumped in to

466
00:18:14,590 --> 00:18:18,429
that same bucket whether or not they

467
00:18:16,690 --> 00:18:20,170
were doing good or not the same thing

468
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:21,610
applies to security I can't think of

469
00:18:20,170 --> 00:18:23,260
anything worse than if one of my direct

470
00:18:21,610 --> 00:18:25,719
competitors was compromised which is why

471
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:27,850
we work so hard to partner with them so

472
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:29,140
that we're making sure we're all we're

473
00:18:27,850 --> 00:18:31,659
all raising the bar to the best degree

474
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:33,790
possible let's be honest does it provide

475
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:35,920
any benefit to anybody if we have

476
00:18:33,790 --> 00:18:37,240
breaches like Marriott or the Capital

477
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:40,030
One or anything like that it doesn't

478
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:42,160
help anybody and so we tend to be in

479
00:18:40,030 --> 00:18:44,110
this industry we tend to try to focus on

480
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:45,190
all the bad and you know point the

481
00:18:44,110 --> 00:18:46,330
finger and say oh well they should have

482
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:48,370
had this control in place of that

483
00:18:46,330 --> 00:18:49,929
control place what we should be doing is

484
00:18:48,370 --> 00:18:51,580
working more closely with each other

485
00:18:49,930 --> 00:18:55,090
to be able to help raise that bar for

486
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:58,780
everybody because if we can do that when

487
00:18:55,090 --> 00:19:00,459
we see that bear it's not gonna be about

488
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:02,139
us trying to outrun the person next to

489
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:04,300
us because the reality is if that person

490
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:07,000
gets eaten that's next to you you're the

491
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:08,919
next target for that bear but if we work

492
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:11,530
together we have an a fighting chance to

493
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:15,000
be able to avoid any meaningful impact

494
00:19:11,530 --> 00:19:18,040
negatively for all parties involved and

495
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:20,670
with that I'm gonna I want to close on I

496
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:24,280
think what the most important part is

497
00:19:20,670 --> 00:19:25,510
Trust starts and ends with you I have

498
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:29,350
worked in a lot of places and I've

499
00:19:25,510 --> 00:19:32,080
worked with a lot of individuals there

500
00:19:29,350 --> 00:19:33,909
are we can we can operate in such a way

501
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:35,770
that we focus more we're like a

502
00:19:33,910 --> 00:19:37,870
Pollyanna right everything's fine it'll

503
00:19:35,770 --> 00:19:40,600
all work out we can be you know the boy

504
00:19:37,870 --> 00:19:41,919
who cried wolf and say you know escalate

505
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:44,439
everything possible until it all becomes

506
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:45,700
noise and leadership doesn't even listen

507
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:47,950
to us anymore because of all the

508
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:49,090
security issues we sit that's ten things

509
00:19:47,950 --> 00:19:50,990
sometimes honestly because there's a lot

510
00:19:49,090 --> 00:19:53,870
of vulnerabilities out there

511
00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:56,480
so we can take that approach or what we

512
00:19:53,870 --> 00:19:58,729
can do is we can say look I even though

513
00:19:56,480 --> 00:20:01,010
I maybe don't have control over the

514
00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:02,920
Board of Directors or how exactly where

515
00:20:01,010 --> 00:20:05,480
or where I report within my organization

516
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:07,940
what we can do is we can look inside

517
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:10,309
ourselves and we can say do I embody the

518
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:12,080
right attributes am I truly focused in

519
00:20:10,309 --> 00:20:14,178
them I am I embodying the attributes of

520
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:17,178
the culture that I want to build and do

521
00:20:14,179 --> 00:20:19,850
that day in and day out I think if we

522
00:20:17,179 --> 00:20:21,200
all take this position if we can work

523
00:20:19,850 --> 00:20:23,270
together on this but on these two

524
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:24,320
challenges that we all face let's be

525
00:20:23,270 --> 00:20:27,620
honest they're all the same kind of

526
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:29,120
challenges and then we we push for the

527
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:31,010
kind of culture and we start with

528
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:32,959
ourselves we fight for tooth and nail

529
00:20:31,010 --> 00:20:35,179
day in and day out make that incremental

530
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:36,620
level of progress and then we partner

531
00:20:35,179 --> 00:20:38,660
together but I think we have a

532
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:40,909
meaningful shot at being able to turn

533
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:43,340
the tide that we've been facing today

534
00:20:40,910 --> 00:20:45,440
and if we do that not only do I think

535
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:47,540
that we will be successful but I think

536
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:50,090
all of us collectively have an

537
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:52,550
opportunity to excel that's my talk I

538
00:20:50,090 --> 00:20:54,740
appreciate the time if there is if there

539
00:20:52,550 --> 00:20:57,350
are any questions you guys have I want

540
00:20:54,740 --> 00:20:59,750
to offer the opportunity for my team to

541
00:20:57,350 --> 00:21:01,699

545
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:09,800
think we can turn the tide as a

546
00:21:07,730 --> 00:21:13,059
collective group I have a great rest of

547
