00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:07,470
good afternoon welcome to responding to

2
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:12,959
a cyber attack with missiles in South

JKL at 18:30 thank you for putting your

13
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:41,489
phone on vibrate it makes it easier for

14
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:43,500
us to ignore it the ringing while you

15
00:00:41,489 --> 00:00:47,269
wait for your voicemail to pick up and

16
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:47,270
with that let us welcome our speaker

17
00:00:52,789 --> 00:00:58,500
thank you very much my name is Mick

18
00:00:56,039 --> 00:01:01,680
Kampf I am the chief Research Officer

19
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:03,949
for f-secure corporation which is an

20
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:09,210
international cybersecurity company

21
00:01:03,949 --> 00:01:14,789
headquartered in Helsinki which is in

22
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:17,189
Finland which is in Europe and Finland

23
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:20,189
is more country five million people with

24
00:01:17,189 --> 00:01:24,360
a very big neighbor the biggest country

25
00:01:20,189 --> 00:01:26,669
on the planet Russia and this has put my

26
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:29,369
home country always in a position where

27
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:32,640
we carefully have to think about what we

28
00:01:29,369 --> 00:01:36,439
do regarding our foreign policy and also

29
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:40,200
but also about how we fight our wars

30
00:01:36,439 --> 00:01:43,648
both my grandfather's fought the

31
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:46,710
Russians in the Second World War and

32
00:01:43,649 --> 00:01:51,119
today we are speaking about war and

33
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:55,979
conflict war and conflict in a new

34
00:01:51,119 --> 00:02:01,530
domain and as I was thinking about how

35
00:01:55,979 --> 00:02:03,539
this cyber world if you will has changed

36
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:05,310
around as over the last years I was

37
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:08,879
actually going through old photos and I

38
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:11,239
found pictures I took here in Vegas 15

39
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:11,239
years ago

40
00:02:11,530 --> 00:02:15,550
DEFCON when DEFCON was still being

41
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:18,880
Alexis Park and I noticed that one of

42
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:20,670
the talks I took a photo of I didn't

43
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:22,780
actually recognize who the speakers are

44
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:28,119
but the topic they are speaking about

45
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:30,130
already that then is cyber warfare so

46
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:31,750
we've been thinking about this for quite

47
00:02:30,130 --> 00:02:33,519
a while but what's happening right now

48
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:37,540
is that we are getting closer and closer

49
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:40,380
to real-world implications where the

50
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:44,350
border is between virtual and real are

51
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:48,250
going away our world is more and more

52
00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:50,980
virtual we are living 50% of our daily

53
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:53,019
lives somewhere else than in the real

54
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:56,488
world you know in our phones on our

55
00:02:53,019 --> 00:02:59,319
devices in a world where geography

56
00:02:56,489 --> 00:03:04,269
doesn't exist it doesn't matter or it

57
00:02:59,319 --> 00:03:07,420
matters in a different way so when there

58
00:03:04,269 --> 00:03:09,880
are governmental operations military

59
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:12,208
operations or intelligence agency

60
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:16,200
operations in that world

61
00:03:12,209 --> 00:03:18,910
how should we respond in the real world

62
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:23,230
there's been policy decisions on this

63
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:25,390
already many years ago the Pentagon has

64
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:27,369
concluded in its first ever review of

65
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:29,679
international cyber attacks that

66
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:32,769
computer sabotage emanating from another

67
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:36,700
country can constitute an act of war so

68
00:03:32,769 --> 00:03:39,880
Pentagon already made declarations about

69
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:44,100
this 10 years ago that cyber attacks are

70
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:46,810
act of war and they reserve the right to

71
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:50,560
respond with any means necessary

72
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:54,910
including kinetic attacks this is not

73
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:57,220
new however it's very easy to say these

74
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:59,170
things and it's much different to do

75
00:03:57,220 --> 00:04:02,700
these things and the reason why it's so

76
00:03:59,170 --> 00:04:06,220
hard is basically one word attribution

77
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:08,980
the difference between virtual attacks

78
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:12,640
or cyber attacks when you compare to any

79
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:16,978
other kind of aggression is that they

80
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:21,990
are so hard to attribute cyber weapons

81
00:04:16,978 --> 00:04:23,840
make sense cyber weapons are cheap

82
00:04:21,990 --> 00:04:27,080
effective

83
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:29,539
and they are deniable when you have a

84
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:31,760
cheap weapon when you have an effective

85
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:35,000
weapon which you can deny that it wasn't

86
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:36,550
yours that's if it's if that's not the

87
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:40,639
perfect weapon it's getting very close

88
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:44,780
to a perfect weapon so regardless of

89
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:47,090
what the policies say that we reserve

90
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:50,840
the right to respond with missiles

91
00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:55,219
against your cyberattack how actually do

92
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:58,789
you know who launched the attack and if

93
00:04:55,220 --> 00:05:01,100
your enemy knows that you will respond

94
00:04:58,790 --> 00:05:05,120
with real-world attacks the obvious

95
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:07,340
tactic would then be that you mask your

96
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:10,280
own attacks to be coming from another

97
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:12,229
enemy of yours we're out your attacks

98
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:15,250
through another country make it look

99
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:19,760
like it's someone else false flag and

100
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:22,760
false flag attacks in cyber domain are

101
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:24,830
very real when we look at the kind of

102
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:27,400
operation is done by intelligence

103
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:29,390
agencies we have seen cases where

104
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:31,520
national intelligence agencies have

105
00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:34,370
tried to make it look like it's another

106
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:37,729
country that's behind a cyber attack

107
00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:40,940
including technical details like hosting

108
00:05:37,729 --> 00:05:42,800
your control and command servers in IP

109
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:45,229
addresses in countries that you would

110
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:48,020
like to fake to be the real source of

111
00:05:45,229 --> 00:05:51,140
the attacks even to the details like

112
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:55,190
we've seen Russians generate bait files

113
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:58,520
for their apt attacks using the Mandarin

114
00:05:55,190 --> 00:06:00,020
Chinese version of word the only reason

115
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:02,599
why they would do that is just to make

116
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:07,280
it look like it's the Chinese when it

117
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:10,039
really is the Russians so attribution

118
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:12,770
how are you ever going to be able to

119
00:06:10,039 --> 00:06:15,620
respond with real-world weapons against

120
00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:20,090
a cyberattack if you're not sure who's

121
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:22,760
behind it we'll get back to this because

122
00:06:20,090 --> 00:06:24,409
first we have to define a little bit

123
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:29,390
like okay we're speaking about cyber

124
00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:32,090
weapons cyber war cyberattacks cyber six

125
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:34,250
well not the last one what do we

126
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:36,780
actually mean by all of this Jeff

127
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:38,160
actually touched upon this

128
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:41,460
this morning when he was speaking about

129
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:45,270
the five domains five domains five

130
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:48,090
domains of war when the mankind started

131
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:51,120
fighting each other obviously the first

132
00:06:48,090 --> 00:06:56,159
weapons we had only work on land you

133
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:58,740
know short and a bow and arrow then we

134
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:00,660
expanded as technology got better we got

135
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:03,690
technology which build off ships so we

136
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:05,790
could see war then we got planes so we

137
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:06,300
got air war then we got satellites and

138
00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:11,280
shit

139
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:14,730
so space war and eventually cyberspace

140
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:17,549
technology has always shaped the face of

141
00:07:14,730 --> 00:07:20,460
conflict it has always shaped the face

142
00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:23,250
of war but the innovation of a new

143
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:26,909
domain doesn't make the old domains go

144
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:30,570
away innovation of sea war didn't make

145
00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:35,580
land war go away conflict just expanded

146
00:07:30,570 --> 00:07:37,830
from land to sea so these new domains

147
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:41,010
have expanded where we can fight our

148
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:44,700
Wars and fight our conflicts and it's

149
00:07:41,010 --> 00:07:48,030
not going to end here as Jeff said in

150
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:49,979
the morning cyber domain is different

151
00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:51,510
from the other domain in fact all of

152
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:53,100
these domains are different from each

153
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:54,960
other but cyber is probably more

154
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:56,970
different than any other domain out

155
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:58,500
there and it's it's not going to be the

156
00:07:56,970 --> 00:08:02,640
last the fact that we have now five

157
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:03,720
places where we can find our Wars it's

158
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:07,050
not going to be forever

159
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:09,780
five there will be eventually a sixth

160
00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:12,270
domain or seventh domain it's gonna

161
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:15,900
happen and it's gonna be really hard

162
00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:18,000
right now for us to imagine what those

163
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:20,760
future domains for conflict future

164
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:23,010
domains for war will be whatever we can

165
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:25,310
imagine it's going to be really you know

166
00:08:23,010 --> 00:08:29,430
it's gonna sound like science fiction

167
00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:32,490
because the next domain after cyber for

168
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:35,520
war isn't gonna be incremental change

169
00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:37,460
like you know robots and drones this is

170
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:40,020
the obvious one this is not a new domain

171
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:42,510
the fact that we can expand the

172
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:46,350
functionality of an existing domain like

173
00:08:42,510 --> 00:08:49,170
you know a war or land war to be more

174
00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:50,420
effective by using machines doesn't

175
00:08:49,170 --> 00:08:53,780
really change the domain

176
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:55,790
to have a new domain sixth domain for

177
00:08:53,780 --> 00:09:00,380
fighting wars would have to be something

178
00:08:55,790 --> 00:09:04,550
revolutionary so how about I don't know

179
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:07,580
DNA warfare where you would use a tax

180
00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:12,770
which would modify our DNA s to fight

181
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:16,220
your enemies or nano warfare where for

182
00:09:12,770 --> 00:09:20,180
example the enemy your enemy would

183
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:22,010
distribute nanobots in your country by

184
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:24,020
for example spraying them in the air

185
00:09:22,010 --> 00:09:26,360
which would enter the bloodstream of

186
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:28,760
your soldiers eventually go to their

187
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:30,800
brains to change their thoughts does

188
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:31,370
that sound like science fiction yes it

189
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:34,790
does

190
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:38,090
just like cyber war sounded like science

191
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:38,990
fiction thirty years ago so we don't

192
00:09:38,090 --> 00:09:41,240
really know yet

193
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:44,060
what the next domain will be but there

194
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:49,690
will be more domains where we fight our

195
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:51,859
Wars one obvious technological

196
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:54,170
revolution which is happening very

197
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:57,220
quickly around us right now is the

198
00:09:54,170 --> 00:09:59,920
development of machine learning based

199
00:09:57,220 --> 00:10:03,440
intelligent systems or if you will

200
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:06,349
artificial intelligence this could be

201
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:09,680
the next domain or it could maybe morph

202
00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:13,580
to be part of of the cyber realm we

203
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:17,780
don't yet know but it's highly likely

204
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:21,200
that the race to artificial intelligence

205
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:23,480
is going to generate more conflict not

206
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:27,650
make less conflict but generate more

207
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:31,190
conflict in the near term and defining

208
00:10:27,650 --> 00:10:35,180
what we mean by this development is is

209
00:10:31,190 --> 00:10:36,470
hard but I suppose one of the easiest

210
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:37,790
ways to think about artificial

211
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:39,590
intelligence which would be as

212
00:10:37,790 --> 00:10:41,839
intelligent as a human would be through

213
00:10:39,590 --> 00:10:44,420
brain simulators it's fairly easy for us

214
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:46,400
to imagine a massive data center which

215
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:48,140
would be able to simulate or emulate

216
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:50,390
every single neuron in the human brain

217
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:53,449
so well it would actually be the same as

218
00:10:50,390 --> 00:10:55,189
a human brain we're still decades away

219
00:10:53,450 --> 00:10:56,960
from being able to do that but I guess

220
00:10:55,190 --> 00:10:58,880
eventually we will be able to do that

221
00:10:56,960 --> 00:11:00,620
and once we're able to do that then we

222
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:03,730
do have for all practical purposes

223
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:09,290
artificial intelligence

224
00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:12,350
artificial intelligence initially such

225
00:11:09,290 --> 00:11:16,189
intelligence would be as intelligent as

226
00:11:12,350 --> 00:11:17,960
we but much slower but we all know what

227
00:11:16,190 --> 00:11:19,730
happens with technology gets better and

228
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:22,580
better faster and faster and that's why

229
00:11:19,730 --> 00:11:24,500
it would eventually be superior if it

230
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:26,440
would only emulate or simulate human

231
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:28,970
brains but it would be able to do it at

232
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:30,890
gazillion times faster than a real human

233
00:11:28,970 --> 00:11:34,670
and it would be superior we couldn't

234
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:37,040
compete the friend of mine says that

235
00:11:34,670 --> 00:11:40,430
whenever he sees the word AI for some

236
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:43,520
reason he he just he doesn't see it as

237
00:11:40,430 --> 00:11:47,750
uppercase a uppercase I season as as a

238
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:51,260
lowercase L so Al like out like you know

239
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:54,050
weird out weird AI and by the way I'm

240
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:57,020
not sure if you know this but you should

241
00:11:54,050 --> 00:12:02,810
know that Weird Al Yankovic is playing

242
00:11:57,020 --> 00:12:04,220
tonight here in Vegas true story is it

243
00:12:02,810 --> 00:12:08,869
might be sold out but he's in town

244
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:11,630
tonight and artificial intelligence is

245
00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:14,510
going to shape the face of conflicts and

246
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:19,270
you don't have to take that from me

247
00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:19,270
you can take that from President Putin

248
00:12:22,570 --> 00:12:42,440
alleged this class and it was just an

249
00:12:34,130 --> 00:12:45,310
original taut little mirror who ever

250
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:51,709
rules artificial intelligence will rule

251
00:12:45,310 --> 00:12:55,510
the world so why would this race to

252
00:12:51,709 --> 00:12:58,910
these new technological revolutions

253
00:12:55,510 --> 00:12:59,720
generate more conflict instead of less

254
00:12:58,910 --> 00:13:03,469
conflict

255
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:05,839
well it's quite clear that if an entity

256
00:13:03,470 --> 00:13:09,560
would announce that they are getting

257
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:11,690
close to having superior artificial

258
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:14,930
intelligence superhuman intelligence at

259
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:15,580
their disposal most likely that entity

260
00:13:14,930 --> 00:13:17,410
would not be

261
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:20,800
a country it wouldn't be a government it

262
00:13:17,410 --> 00:13:24,550
would be a company it would be Google

263
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:26,920
Apple IBM Microsoft one of these now

264
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:30,339
just imagine one of these companies

265
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:32,199
would announce that they are or they

266
00:13:30,339 --> 00:13:35,140
already do have superior intelligence

267
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:38,380
are they getting close to like making

268
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:40,740
the breakthrough all other players

269
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:44,620
including all other foreign governments

270
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:47,290
would realize that if someone else comes

271
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:51,279
up with superhuman intelligence it is

272
00:13:47,290 --> 00:13:55,209
game over they will now win everything

273
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:58,510
they will win that competition they will

274
00:13:55,209 --> 00:14:00,910
win with superior product or superior

275
00:13:58,510 --> 00:14:05,100
plants they will win every conflict they

276
00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:08,920
will win every war so no matter what

277
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:12,930
that technology must be stolen and if it

278
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:16,149
cannot be stolen it must be destroyed

279
00:14:12,930 --> 00:14:19,959
that's what's gonna generate more

280
00:14:16,149 --> 00:14:25,420
conflict not less conflict so this race

281
00:14:19,959 --> 00:14:27,609
to AI is a scary race if we get close to

282
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:30,550
actually having this at our disposal

283
00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:32,290
other entities including other countries

284
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:35,560
and other governments will not sit idly

285
00:14:32,290 --> 00:14:37,689
by if they can't be first they will do

286
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:38,790
whatever it takes to steal it or destroy

287
00:14:37,690 --> 00:14:43,360
it

288
00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:47,140
race to AI is a scary race but we're not

289
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:50,430
there yet one question I hear a lot

290
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:53,589
about artificial intelligence is about

291
00:14:50,430 --> 00:14:58,000
malicious use in our world so cyber

292
00:14:53,589 --> 00:15:01,720
attacks using machine learning or cyber

293
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:03,699
attacks using intelligent systems and we

294
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:06,970
are actually not really seeing that we

295
00:15:03,699 --> 00:15:09,490
see very isolated typically academic

296
00:15:06,970 --> 00:15:12,640
examples on how it could be done the

297
00:15:09,490 --> 00:15:14,260
only practical cases where machine

298
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:16,420
learning is being abused by attackers

299
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:19,480
our cases your attackers are trying to

300
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:22,329
poison the learning systems used by the

301
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:24,220
good guys so all of you who work in

302
00:15:22,329 --> 00:15:25,630
computer security industry know that

303
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:27,160
we've been using you

304
00:15:25,630 --> 00:15:29,290
using machine learning for years we

305
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:31,089
started our machine learning systems

306
00:15:29,290 --> 00:15:34,329
eight years ago so there's nothing new

307
00:15:31,090 --> 00:15:36,430
here defenders have been using learning

308
00:15:34,330 --> 00:15:37,860
systems and machine learning for defense

309
00:15:36,430 --> 00:15:40,810
for years and years

310
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:42,640
attackers know this attackers have been

311
00:15:40,810 --> 00:15:44,890
trying to poison the learning systems we

312
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:48,610
use for example systems which try to

313
00:15:44,890 --> 00:15:50,980
categorize spam with attacks for quite a

314
00:15:48,610 --> 00:15:53,440
while but what they haven't done yet is

315
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:57,510
to launch actual attacks which would

316
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:59,710
learn so why haven't we seen this I

317
00:15:57,510 --> 00:16:02,650
guess the main reason is very practical

318
00:15:59,710 --> 00:16:03,910
there's such a lack of talent in

319
00:16:02,650 --> 00:16:06,069
artificial intelligence and machine

320
00:16:03,910 --> 00:16:08,530
learning and data analyst world that if

321
00:16:06,070 --> 00:16:10,840
you know how to build anything like this

322
00:16:08,530 --> 00:16:14,350
you don't have to go into life of crime

323
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:17,910
you will get a well-paid job anywhere on

324
00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:20,710
the planet this is the situation today

325
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:21,430
but it's not going to last for much

326
00:16:20,710 --> 00:16:23,290
longer

327
00:16:21,430 --> 00:16:26,040
it's not gonna last for more than a

328
00:16:23,290 --> 00:16:28,810
couple of years more because eventually

329
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:31,449
someone will make it easy enough

330
00:16:28,810 --> 00:16:33,550
someone will lower the bar low enough

331
00:16:31,450 --> 00:16:35,350
right now if you want to use a system

332
00:16:33,550 --> 00:16:38,490
like I don't know tensorflow you have to

333
00:16:35,350 --> 00:16:40,860
be a computer science student or grad

334
00:16:38,490 --> 00:16:43,450
eventually you can be any idiot

335
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:45,250
eventually any idiot will be able to use

336
00:16:43,450 --> 00:16:47,380
machine learning systems because they

337
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:49,500
become easy enough to use this is gonna

338
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:52,720
happen in two to three years and then

339
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:54,700
then we will start seeing attacks which

340
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:56,500
will be using machine learning and

341
00:16:54,700 --> 00:17:04,300
artificial intelligence in their world

342
00:16:56,500 --> 00:17:08,020
because it's easy enough to use all

343
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:09,790
right so let's speak about the powers at

344
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:13,689
play the countries that have the

345
00:17:09,790 --> 00:17:18,369
capability to do cyber attacks to fight

346
00:17:13,689 --> 00:17:20,230
in this new domain who's the best well

347
00:17:18,369 --> 00:17:22,030
we are in the best the United States of

348
00:17:20,230 --> 00:17:25,420
America I've been investing more money

349
00:17:22,030 --> 00:17:26,649
more manpower for longer time than any

350
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:29,110
other government on the planet no

351
00:17:26,650 --> 00:17:31,320
question it's quite clear who is number

352
00:17:29,110 --> 00:17:34,439
one

353
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:37,620
but then we have the rest of the world

354
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:40,140
we have the Russians we have the North

355
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:42,449
Koreans we have the Iranians we have the

356
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:47,010
Chinese so let me play you a video clip

357
00:17:42,450 --> 00:17:51,540
from 2015 where Obama is commenting

358
00:17:47,010 --> 00:17:56,250
about his view on the balance of power

359
00:17:51,540 --> 00:18:01,290
between cyber power of USA and cyber

360
00:17:56,250 --> 00:18:03,300
power of China and so for example I'm

361
00:18:01,290 --> 00:18:06,389
gonna be getting a visit from President

362
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:08,520
Xi of China a state visit here coming up

363
00:18:06,390 --> 00:18:11,820
in a couple of weeks we've made very

364
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:13,230
clear to the Chinese that there are

365
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:14,450
certain practices that they're engaging

366
00:18:13,230 --> 00:18:17,280
in

367
00:18:14,450 --> 00:18:23,120
that we know are emanating from China

368
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:27,090
and are not acceptable and you know we

369
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:30,600
we can choose to make this an area of

370
00:18:27,090 --> 00:18:34,080
competition which I guarantee you will

371
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:36,330
win if we have to or alternatively we

372
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:39,449
can come to an agreement in which we say

373
00:18:36,330 --> 00:18:41,490
this isn't helping anybody let's instead

374
00:18:39,450 --> 00:18:44,820
try to have some basic rules of the road

375
00:18:41,490 --> 00:18:45,720
in terms of how we how we operate now as

376
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:48,030
I said they're still going to be

377
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:49,950
individual actors they're gonna be

378
00:18:48,030 --> 00:18:51,270
terrorist networks and others so we're

379
00:18:49,950 --> 00:18:55,230
still going to have to build a strong

380
00:18:51,270 --> 00:18:59,760
defense but one of our first and most

381
00:18:55,230 --> 00:19:00,510
important efforts has to be to get in

382
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:05,570
the States

383
00:19:00,510 --> 00:19:10,290
that may be sponsoring cyber attacks to

384
00:19:05,570 --> 00:19:13,409
to understand that you know there comes

385
00:19:10,290 --> 00:19:14,909
a point at which we consider this a core

386
00:19:13,410 --> 00:19:18,660
national security threat

387
00:19:14,910 --> 00:19:20,700
and we will treat a decision there's an

388
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:22,890
excellent question from one of our cyber

389
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:28,950
warriors here I'm fluent in Maryland it

390
00:19:22,890 --> 00:19:30,420
looks like in those ways them I missed

391
00:19:28,950 --> 00:19:33,320
this guy I don't even live in this

392
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:33,320
country and I miss this guy

393
00:19:33,930 --> 00:19:39,170
[Music]

394
00:19:37,090 --> 00:19:41,689
but if you paid attention to what he

395
00:19:39,170 --> 00:19:44,240
said about the capabilities he said that

396
00:19:41,690 --> 00:19:45,830
we know between USA and China we would

397
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:47,920
rather not make it a competition he

398
00:19:45,830 --> 00:19:51,050
would not actually start the fight but

399
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:53,570
if they would have to fight he would

400
00:19:51,050 --> 00:19:57,919
assure that they would win and he would

401
00:19:53,570 --> 00:20:01,100
probably be right and China is one of

402
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:03,320
the stronger powers at play but this

403
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:06,290
world is a symmetric especially when we

404
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:08,780
look at the smaller countries they don't

405
00:20:06,290 --> 00:20:10,399
have nearly as much to lose as for

406
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:13,730
example China would and this is

407
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:16,240
especially evident with North Korea when

408
00:20:13,730 --> 00:20:19,460
we look at what's been happening

409
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:22,220
regarding the cyber attacks against the

410
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:25,430
rest of the world from North Korea this

411
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:27,500
is the outlier we can look at every

412
00:20:25,430 --> 00:20:29,780
single governmental attack we've ever

413
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:31,610
seen from any of the players and we can

414
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:34,399
put all of the attacks we've seen into

415
00:20:31,610 --> 00:20:36,770
two different groups either it's been

416
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:39,350
about spying or about intelligence

417
00:20:36,770 --> 00:20:42,500
gathering group number one or it's been

418
00:20:39,350 --> 00:20:44,780
about sabotage or actual warfare group

419
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:49,550
number two everything is either spying

420
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:51,320
or sabotage except North Korea North

421
00:20:49,550 --> 00:20:54,639
Korea has done spying and sabotage but

422
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:56,600
they've also done theft and there is no

423
00:20:54,640 --> 00:21:01,240
there's no other government of this

424
00:20:56,600 --> 00:21:03,889
planet which would resort to stealing

425
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:06,170
from other governments to try to fix

426
00:21:03,890 --> 00:21:08,240
their budget deficit but that's exactly

427
00:21:06,170 --> 00:21:12,830
what North Korea has done we actually

428
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:15,110
released a paper last week these

429
00:21:12,830 --> 00:21:16,939
pictures from the paper regarding the

430
00:21:15,110 --> 00:21:18,139
attacks from North Korea if you want to

431
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:19,970
download the paper it's called cyber

432
00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:22,490
threat landscape for the finance sector

433
00:21:19,970 --> 00:21:24,290
we would speak about financial sector in

434
00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:26,510
particular as a target because many of

435
00:21:24,290 --> 00:21:28,129
these attacks from North Korea have been

436
00:21:26,510 --> 00:21:31,190
targeting financial sector in order to

437
00:21:28,130 --> 00:21:33,260
steal money Soviet targets traditional

438
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:35,780
financial sector some of its target

439
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:37,850
especially cryptocurrency exchanges

440
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:40,460
because they want money which is

441
00:21:37,850 --> 00:21:44,120
anonymous and untrackable which

442
00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:45,539
cryptocurrencies are so that is the

443
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:48,299
outlier

444
00:21:45,539 --> 00:21:50,669
which is willing to do attacks where

445
00:21:48,299 --> 00:21:53,009
they are stealing money to fix their

446
00:21:50,669 --> 00:21:54,690
budget deficit it's an outlier in many

447
00:21:53,009 --> 00:21:56,879
other ways we haven't seen any other

448
00:21:54,690 --> 00:21:59,039
government which would launch attack

449
00:21:56,879 --> 00:22:02,519
against foreign private companies in

450
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:04,259
order to protest against movies but as

451
00:22:02,519 --> 00:22:06,989
you remember from five years ago this is

452
00:22:04,259 --> 00:22:09,629
exactly what happened as Sony Pictures

453
00:22:06,989 --> 00:22:11,519
announced they would be about to release

454
00:22:09,629 --> 00:22:21,738
a movie where the climax of the movie

455
00:22:11,519 --> 00:22:24,119
would look like this that is Kimia booth

456
00:22:21,739 --> 00:22:25,950
and there is no point for me to try to

457
00:22:24,119 --> 00:22:29,599
speak anything on top of this because we

458
00:22:25,950 --> 00:22:29,599
will be watching is anyway

459
00:22:30,310 --> 00:22:33,379
[Music]

460
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:40,509
[Music]

461
00:22:43,790 --> 00:22:50,070
and yes he does die in the movie and I'm

462
00:22:47,190 --> 00:22:53,120
sorry if I spoiled the plot to you but

463
00:22:50,070 --> 00:22:53,120
it's not a very good movie

464
00:22:53,300 --> 00:23:00,350
so why is North Korea important well

465
00:22:56,790 --> 00:23:03,840
it's important because no clear any

466
00:23:00,350 --> 00:23:06,810
country like this isn't really a problem

467
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:11,000
at world scale unless they have access

468
00:23:06,810 --> 00:23:14,970
to to weapons of mass destruction

469
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:18,360
nuclear weapons changed the world quite

470
00:23:14,970 --> 00:23:21,020
obviously we would all all agree on that

471
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:24,780
they indeed the Second World War and

472
00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:28,500
they are a prime example of deterrence

473
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:31,440
at play however when you think about

474
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:34,680
nuclear weapons that is also a prime

475
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:38,460
example of how technology changes

476
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:42,810
conflict nuclear weapons were planned

477
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:46,740
and built by people like us by the nerds

478
00:23:42,810 --> 00:23:51,540
and Geeks of their generation and you

479
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:55,500
could argue that nuclear physicists lost

480
00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:57,510
their innocence in 1945 when we the

481
00:23:55,500 --> 00:24:01,200
mankind for the first stun use the power

482
00:23:57,510 --> 00:24:03,150
of the atom to kill and if that's true

483
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:07,770
then it would claim exactly in the same

484
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:11,760
way that computer scientists lost their

485
00:24:07,770 --> 00:24:15,810
innocence in 2011 when Stuxnet was

486
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:18,210
launched against the bush were nuclear

487
00:24:15,810 --> 00:24:25,740
facilities in Iran with an attack which

488
00:24:18,210 --> 00:24:27,540
had the power to kill people nuclear

489
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:32,970
scientists lost their innocence in forty

490
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:35,970
five computer scientists in 2011 Stuxnet

491
00:24:32,970 --> 00:24:38,640
is a landmark case in our world pretty

492
00:24:35,970 --> 00:24:40,200
obviously that's Stuxnet in Persian if

493
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:42,290
you didn't know the language actually

494
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:45,510
picked it up from a site called

495
00:24:42,290 --> 00:24:45,909
infographic stop by our IRS the Iranian

496
00:24:45,510 --> 00:24:48,370
teal

497
00:24:45,910 --> 00:24:52,210
but they have plenty of interesting

498
00:24:48,370 --> 00:24:57,699
infographics about what cyber attacks

499
00:24:52,210 --> 00:25:00,400
will look like now there is time before

500
00:24:57,700 --> 00:25:04,380
stocks met and time after Stuxnet that's

501
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:07,530
how crucial it is in our world it really

502
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:10,780
changed the way we think about how

503
00:25:07,530 --> 00:25:13,750
virtual attack affects the real world

504
00:25:10,780 --> 00:25:16,899
and how governments can use that to

505
00:25:13,750 --> 00:25:19,030
actually execute their policies now when

506
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:20,860
I say stocks it had the power to kill

507
00:25:19,030 --> 00:25:22,780
people completely it did because it

508
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:24,459
violently broke centrifuge which were

509
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:25,720
filled with uranium gas if there were

510
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:27,670
any people close to it when that

511
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:29,650
happened they would die we didn't

512
00:25:27,670 --> 00:25:32,920
actually know if anybody died just

513
00:25:29,650 --> 00:25:34,200
directly because of this Stuxnet code of

514
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:37,930
course plenty of people did die

515
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:40,720
indirectly also people in our line of

516
00:25:37,930 --> 00:25:45,660
work because plenty of computer security

517
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:49,120
people have died because of the attacks

518
00:25:45,660 --> 00:25:52,900
against the Iranian nuclear program for

519
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:54,580
example this guy mr. Ahmadi who was a

520
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:57,250
specialist in cyber defenses was

521
00:25:54,580 --> 00:25:59,830
assassinated in Iran and this team at

522
00:25:57,250 --> 00:26:01,210
least two car bombs this is the car of

523
00:25:59,830 --> 00:26:04,179
mr. maruge rere

524
00:26:01,210 --> 00:26:07,120
who was a computer security expert in

525
00:26:04,180 --> 00:26:09,970
Iran killed because of his skills and

526
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:12,639
whenever computer security experts are

527
00:26:09,970 --> 00:26:14,440
killed regardless of where they are in

528
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:16,510
the world it doesn't really feel very

529
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:21,670
nice does it because we are computer

530
00:26:16,510 --> 00:26:26,820
security experts ourselves which brings

531
00:26:21,670 --> 00:26:29,830
us to this year Israeli Defense Forces

532
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:32,439
tweeted pretty much exactly six months

533
00:26:29,830 --> 00:26:35,760
ago about an operation they had executed

534
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:35,760
against Hamas

535
00:26:36,210 --> 00:26:43,420
we're at launch missiles to take down an

536
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:45,969
Operations Center at the Gaza Strip and

537
00:26:43,420 --> 00:26:49,000
that Operations Center wasn't building

538
00:26:45,970 --> 00:26:52,810
bombs it wasn't doing propaganda for

539
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:55,500
Hamas it was doing cyberattacks and this

540
00:26:52,810 --> 00:26:58,330
becomes now a fine line obviously this

541
00:26:55,500 --> 00:27:00,070
nobody would bat an eyelid if they

542
00:26:58,330 --> 00:27:02,980
launched a missile against the bombed

543
00:27:00,070 --> 00:27:05,139
building factory today Lords besides

544
00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:07,390
against propaganda building places

545
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:10,270
before which isn't directly killing

546
00:27:07,390 --> 00:27:13,000
anyone but it's very clearly connected

547
00:27:10,270 --> 00:27:16,150
to the Hamas operations but now when it

548
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:19,060
was actually a cyber center it did feel

549
00:27:16,150 --> 00:27:23,100
different it did feel like we had

550
00:27:19,060 --> 00:27:25,510
crossed another line was this again a

551
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:27,870
similar event where we would speak about

552
00:27:25,510 --> 00:27:31,110
time before this event and then time

553
00:27:27,870 --> 00:27:37,600
after the event

554
00:27:31,110 --> 00:27:43,270
maybe now the fact that attribution here

555
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:46,360
wasn't hindering the real-world response

556
00:27:43,270 --> 00:27:49,450
is important to think about in this case

557
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:52,689
they knew perfectly well who they were

558
00:27:49,450 --> 00:27:55,480
fighting they had enough know how maybe

559
00:27:52,690 --> 00:27:58,210
insiders who knew where these cyber

560
00:27:55,480 --> 00:28:00,490
operations were physically coming from

561
00:27:58,210 --> 00:28:02,830
they had people on the ground most

562
00:28:00,490 --> 00:28:04,750
likely they had been watching the

563
00:28:02,830 --> 00:28:06,939
physical building before they launched

564
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:09,640
attacks against it they had enough

565
00:28:06,940 --> 00:28:13,660
confidence to believe that attribution

566
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:16,060
was accurate for most cyberattacks this

567
00:28:13,660 --> 00:28:18,940
is not the case and also it's important

568
00:28:16,060 --> 00:28:21,070
they're not just responding to only a

569
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:24,340
cyber attack obviously Hamas has been

570
00:28:21,070 --> 00:28:26,560
actively sending missiles against Israel

571
00:28:24,340 --> 00:28:28,209
themselves if it would be only cyber

572
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:30,820
attacks it would be a different question

573
00:28:28,210 --> 00:28:34,180
but when it's part of a bigger picture

574
00:28:30,820 --> 00:28:38,470
it changes this is also a good example

575
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:42,820
on open source intelligence because when

576
00:28:38,470 --> 00:28:45,340
the Israeli Defense Forces spokesperson

577
00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:47,830
tweeted about this operation they had

578
00:28:45,340 --> 00:28:50,169
done he included an

579
00:28:47,830 --> 00:28:52,480
image of the building they had just

580
00:28:50,170 --> 00:28:54,820
marked so what did I do

581
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:56,800
well I tweeted about this but hey does

582
00:28:54,820 --> 00:29:00,760
anybody happen to know where this

583
00:28:56,800 --> 00:29:03,190
building is five hours later someone

584
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:04,930
replies with the coordinates this is

585
00:29:03,190 --> 00:29:07,480
what we call open source intelligence

586
00:29:04,930 --> 00:29:09,160
there's always someone somewhere who

587
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:11,020
knows where things are or who can

588
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:15,310
actually go on location and double-check

589
00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:21,220
these things and this means that we are

590
00:29:15,310 --> 00:29:23,290
in a very practical arms race now when I

591
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:25,120
spoke about nuclear weapons I said that

592
00:29:23,290 --> 00:29:29,050
they are also a perfect example on the

593
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:31,840
power of deterrence and the power of

594
00:29:29,050 --> 00:29:36,490
traditional weapons is very much in

595
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:38,980
deterrence if you have traditional

596
00:29:36,490 --> 00:29:43,420
weapons that you can show in military

597
00:29:38,980 --> 00:29:45,430
parades you don't have to use for you

598
00:29:43,420 --> 00:29:47,350
hope but you don't have to use them most

599
00:29:45,430 --> 00:29:52,090
cases you don't it's enough to have

600
00:29:47,350 --> 00:29:54,760
nuclear weapons have been used in actual

601
00:29:52,090 --> 00:29:56,500
war two times in mankind's history the

602
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:59,080
rest of the power of the tens of

603
00:29:56,500 --> 00:30:01,810
thousands of active nuclear warheads on

604
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:03,669
this planet right now is not in using

605
00:30:01,810 --> 00:30:06,010
them it's in having them and then doing

606
00:30:03,670 --> 00:30:08,890
nuclear testing to show your enemies

607
00:30:06,010 --> 00:30:10,870
that you have there are 11 countries on

608
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:13,120
this planet which have nuclear weapons

609
00:30:10,870 --> 00:30:14,649
right now everybody knows which those

610
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:16,300
countries are and when you know that the

611
00:30:14,650 --> 00:30:19,240
country has nuclear weapons then you

612
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:20,770
don't pick a fight with those countries

613
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:24,460
because they have no clear weapons this

614
00:30:20,770 --> 00:30:26,379
is how deterrence works we know exactly

615
00:30:24,460 --> 00:30:28,360
which countries have nuclear weapons we

616
00:30:26,380 --> 00:30:31,210
know exactly which countries have

617
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:33,760
aircraft carriers we know exactly which

618
00:30:31,210 --> 00:30:36,370
countries have fighter jets and tanks we

619
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:39,460
know how many tanks we know where they

620
00:30:36,370 --> 00:30:41,320
are in fact how do we know this how do

621
00:30:39,460 --> 00:30:44,620
we know how many fighter jets a country

622
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:46,070
ask well you google for it it's a

623
00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:49,909
Wikipedia

624
00:30:46,070 --> 00:30:52,850
we show these publicly military parades

625
00:30:49,910 --> 00:30:54,620
you can see how many fighter jets the

626
00:30:52,850 --> 00:30:55,459
Russians have you can see how many

627
00:30:54,620 --> 00:30:58,879
planes

628
00:30:55,460 --> 00:31:04,340
north Korea has fun fact North Korea

629
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:08,540
according to the AP dia has 55 no sorry

630
00:31:04,340 --> 00:31:11,060
84 choppers illegally obtained by

631
00:31:08,540 --> 00:31:12,950
circumventing the US export controls how

632
00:31:11,060 --> 00:31:19,879
the hell do you get 84 choppers without

633
00:31:12,950 --> 00:31:23,150
I don't know now this means that the

634
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:25,850
power of weapons has been more in

635
00:31:23,150 --> 00:31:29,210
deterrence than in actually using them

636
00:31:25,850 --> 00:31:31,939
and this power does not apply to cyber

637
00:31:29,210 --> 00:31:34,370
weapon cyber weapons have no deterrence

638
00:31:31,940 --> 00:31:38,420
power or they haven't had deterrence

639
00:31:34,370 --> 00:31:42,679
power so far because we have no idea who

640
00:31:38,420 --> 00:31:46,190
has what we know that all developed

641
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:49,010
nations are developing cyber defenses

642
00:31:46,190 --> 00:31:52,400
and cyber offenses everybody's doing

643
00:31:49,010 --> 00:31:56,540
this so a question what is the offensive

644
00:31:52,400 --> 00:32:03,220
cyber capability of Italy or New Zealand

645
00:31:56,540 --> 00:32:06,050
or Vietnam we have no idea we don't know

646
00:32:03,220 --> 00:32:08,420
so what kind of deterrence do these

647
00:32:06,050 --> 00:32:11,210
tools build nothing

648
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:14,270
there's no deterrence power in weapons

649
00:32:11,210 --> 00:32:16,280
that nobody knows about and this is made

650
00:32:14,270 --> 00:32:20,150
more problematic by the fact that

651
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:22,520
weapons rust traditional weapons rusts

652
00:32:20,150 --> 00:32:25,130
they have a limited lifespan cyber

653
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:31,970
weapons rust too in many cases they rust

654
00:32:25,130 --> 00:32:34,760
much quicker imagine a typical exploit

655
00:32:31,970 --> 00:32:38,150
which would be a building block for a

656
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:40,910
weapon let's say zero day in Microsoft

657
00:32:38,150 --> 00:32:42,920
Windows do you know that your enemies

658
00:32:40,910 --> 00:32:45,530
use Windows in many systems both

659
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:47,060
civilian and military and if you have an

660
00:32:45,530 --> 00:32:50,540
unknown zero day which grants you access

661
00:32:47,060 --> 00:32:53,480
to all of those installations great but

662
00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:55,460
it's not gonna work forever it might

663
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:58,340
work for a very limited amount of time

664
00:32:55,460 --> 00:32:59,890
because systems change new versions of

665
00:32:58,340 --> 00:33:02,860
operating systems come into

666
00:32:59,890 --> 00:33:05,860
and the vendors might find

667
00:33:02,860 --> 00:33:07,510
vulnerabilities and fix them your cyber

668
00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:09,419
weapons rust they have a limited life

669
00:33:07,510 --> 00:33:13,900
life ban white spats

670
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:16,390
so put yourselves in the shoes of a

671
00:33:13,900 --> 00:33:18,280
general who's investing millions and

672
00:33:16,390 --> 00:33:20,830
millions into building weapons when he's

673
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:23,680
investing into traditional weapons like

674
00:33:20,830 --> 00:33:25,480
fighter jets well they have deterrence

675
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:27,880
power you don't have to use them they

676
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:30,100
have a lifespan of 3040 years you can

677
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:32,380
show them in parades you get bang for

678
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:34,560
the buck but when you do investments of

679
00:33:32,380 --> 00:33:38,140
millions in decipher weapons

680
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:41,020
nobody knows you have them and they only

681
00:33:38,140 --> 00:33:42,730
work for a limited time then they expire

682
00:33:41,020 --> 00:33:45,490
and you have to delete them and you can

683
00:33:42,730 --> 00:33:48,580
no bang for the buck no return on your

684
00:33:45,490 --> 00:33:51,520
investment whatsoever and this problem

685
00:33:48,580 --> 00:33:53,949
makes it more likely that cyber weapons

686
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:56,260
actually end up being used now I'm not

687
00:33:53,950 --> 00:33:57,760
claiming that somebody would start you

688
00:33:56,260 --> 00:33:59,680
know using weapons just because they

689
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:03,250
haven't no what I'm saying is that

690
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:05,380
militaries might end up giving weapons

691
00:34:03,250 --> 00:34:06,790
that they've built which are reaching

692
00:34:05,380 --> 00:34:08,560
the end of their lifetime to

693
00:34:06,790 --> 00:34:10,210
intelligence agencies so you know we

694
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:11,799
have this thing which you would use to

695
00:34:10,210 --> 00:34:13,540
gain access to every windows on the

696
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:14,679
planet so it kind of work for much

697
00:34:13,540 --> 00:34:17,199
longer maybe you could use it for

698
00:34:14,679 --> 00:34:20,380
something because we we haven't had any

699
00:34:17,199 --> 00:34:22,000
more reason to use it in this is the

700
00:34:20,380 --> 00:34:24,520
scenario which is very likely to happen

701
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:28,929
because cyber weapons have no deterrence

702
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:32,370
power so how do we solve this well one

703
00:34:28,929 --> 00:34:35,980
way is to try to get deterrence power

704
00:34:32,370 --> 00:34:38,440
recycle weapons as well how do we do

705
00:34:35,980 --> 00:34:41,860
that how do you do a military parade for

706
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:43,750
cyber weapons well you could have public

707
00:34:41,860 --> 00:34:46,870
demonstrations of cyber power like you

708
00:34:43,750 --> 00:34:49,480
know war games where you use cyber

709
00:34:46,870 --> 00:34:52,000
attacks to showcase how effective they

710
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:54,639
are in the hopes of building deterrence

711
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:56,469
power in your or people you know in the

712
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:58,690
hopes of scaring your enemies showing

713
00:34:56,469 --> 00:35:02,169
how good you are in offensive use of

714
00:34:58,690 --> 00:35:04,060
cyber now we haven't seen any country do

715
00:35:02,170 --> 00:35:07,210
that yet but it could very well be that

716
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:10,900
this could change and maybe that's what

717
00:35:07,210 --> 00:35:13,360
we need if you want to fight cyber

718
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:16,420
mutually assured destruction

719
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:19,630
this is a very different world when you

720
00:35:16,420 --> 00:35:21,760
think about genetic warfare

721
00:35:19,630 --> 00:35:23,470
we have enough warheads on this planet

722
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:25,420
to kill everybody on the planet many

723
00:35:23,470 --> 00:35:29,080
times over and what would the similar

724
00:35:25,420 --> 00:35:34,320
attack look like in our domain in cyber

725
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:37,420
domain modern societies run on computers

726
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:39,430
the food you ate today was made in

727
00:35:37,420 --> 00:35:43,270
factories which are running on computers

728
00:35:39,430 --> 00:35:45,790
to water you drink which is being built

729
00:35:43,270 --> 00:35:48,009
or bottled in factories controlled by

730
00:35:45,790 --> 00:35:52,210
computers our societies run on

731
00:35:48,010 --> 00:35:56,470
electricity and computers and when we

732
00:35:52,210 --> 00:36:00,730
face governmental attacks cyber is the

733
00:35:56,470 --> 00:36:02,200
next domain we have to be defending and

734
00:36:00,730 --> 00:36:03,970
this is a lesson that has to be learned

735
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:05,740
not just by government but also by

736
00:36:03,970 --> 00:36:08,319
private companies because private

737
00:36:05,740 --> 00:36:10,660
companies control very big part of our

738
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:13,570
critical infrastructure and when

739
00:36:10,660 --> 00:36:15,779
companies face attacks by governments

740
00:36:13,570 --> 00:36:20,020
these attacks are very very different

741
00:36:15,780 --> 00:36:23,410
most attacks which hit private companies

742
00:36:20,020 --> 00:36:26,820
are coming from criminals criminals who

743
00:36:23,410 --> 00:36:30,100
don't really want to attack you

744
00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:31,660
criminals who just want money I mean

745
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:34,810
they don't really after you they want

746
00:36:31,660 --> 00:36:37,750
money and if it's too hard too slow too

747
00:36:34,810 --> 00:36:39,910
expensive to attack you they will go

748
00:36:37,750 --> 00:36:41,980
after an easier target they will go

749
00:36:39,910 --> 00:36:45,460
after the low-hanging fruit and believe

750
00:36:41,980 --> 00:36:47,890
me when I tell you that the Internet is

751
00:36:45,460 --> 00:36:51,940
a garden of low-hanging fruit they can

752
00:36:47,890 --> 00:36:55,560
easily find easier targets to make money

753
00:36:51,940 --> 00:36:58,060
but when the attacker is not after money

754
00:36:55,560 --> 00:37:00,220
when the attacker is a governmental

755
00:36:58,060 --> 00:37:02,680
attacker typically then the attacker is

756
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:05,560
from a military organization and what

757
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:10,330
military people do is that they follow

758
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:12,880
orders so the order has been you go you

759
00:37:10,330 --> 00:37:14,710
break into that organization you steal

760
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:16,300
this information you report back when

761
00:37:14,710 --> 00:37:19,510
you've stolen it well that's what

762
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:21,250
they're gonna do and if they can't do it

763
00:37:19,510 --> 00:37:23,920
they will try again until they will

764
00:37:21,250 --> 00:37:25,300
succeed they will keep repeating they

765
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:27,580
will try different

766
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:31,150
attack until they succeed this is why we

767
00:37:27,580 --> 00:37:33,490
call a PT's advanced persistent threats

768
00:37:31,150 --> 00:37:36,100
they are persistent they don't give up

769
00:37:33,490 --> 00:37:38,080
normal attackers give up governmental

770
00:37:36,100 --> 00:37:40,690
attackers don't that's why they get in

771
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:44,560
if you just keep on trying over and over

772
00:37:40,690 --> 00:37:46,720
again eventually you will get it and

773
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:51,520
when we look at all the countries on the

774
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:54,970
planet who is most exposed in cyber war

775
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:57,190
well the United States of America is

776
00:37:54,970 --> 00:38:00,069
most exposed this is the most reliant

777
00:37:57,190 --> 00:38:03,190
country on the planet on technology when

778
00:38:00,070 --> 00:38:05,110
you look at countries that USA is having

779
00:38:03,190 --> 00:38:07,330
a beef with right now those countries

780
00:38:05,110 --> 00:38:10,570
are not nearly as reliant on technology

781
00:38:07,330 --> 00:38:13,840
as USA this is how a symmetric the

782
00:38:10,570 --> 00:38:15,580
situation is and it's not just about

783
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:21,940
attacking governments and military

784
00:38:15,580 --> 00:38:24,069
targets a legitimate target can be a

785
00:38:21,940 --> 00:38:26,830
private company as well this is defined

786
00:38:24,070 --> 00:38:31,030
in the Geneva Convention and the

787
00:38:26,830 --> 00:38:34,120
definition as I read it the way I read

788
00:38:31,030 --> 00:38:37,930
it would actually tell me that for

789
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:40,690
example during time of war the company

790
00:38:37,930 --> 00:38:43,419
that I work for would be a legitimate

791
00:38:40,690 --> 00:38:47,050
military target for example legitimate

792
00:38:43,420 --> 00:38:50,320
military target for bombing which

793
00:38:47,050 --> 00:38:52,540
doesn't feel too good this is map

794
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:55,770
overall at the area in Helsinki where

795
00:38:52,540 --> 00:38:58,660
our headquarters is the bombs you see

796
00:38:55,770 --> 00:39:01,509
overlaid on the map are bombs from the

797
00:38:58,660 --> 00:39:03,759
last war one of them is right dead

798
00:39:01,510 --> 00:39:07,470
center on top of our headquarters and I

799
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:10,990
really wouldn't want to see that again

800
00:39:07,470 --> 00:39:12,520
so the question becomes should we be

801
00:39:10,990 --> 00:39:15,939
responding to cyber attacks with

802
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:20,710
missiles and the answer is yes probably

803
00:39:15,940 --> 00:39:24,400
yes we should if the attacker is in

804
00:39:20,710 --> 00:39:27,100
doing only cyber attacks if this attack

805
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:31,090
is part of a bigger conflict if there

806
00:39:27,100 --> 00:39:33,549
are all domains in play if you can do

807
00:39:31,090 --> 00:39:34,610
the attribution then there's no reason

808
00:39:33,550 --> 00:39:38,230
why

809
00:39:34,610 --> 00:39:41,390
you wouldn't be attacking or responding

810
00:39:38,230 --> 00:39:43,970
with missiles against a virtual attack

811
00:39:41,390 --> 00:39:46,250
maybe the more interesting question is

812
00:39:43,970 --> 00:39:48,080
the other way around should we be

813
00:39:46,250 --> 00:39:50,840
responding to missile attacks with cyber

814
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:52,700
is that enough do we have now enough

815
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:55,490
capability in cyberattacks

816
00:39:52,700 --> 00:40:01,330
and they would be more devastating the

817
00:39:55,490 --> 00:40:05,779
real-world attacks cyber war or to quote

818
00:40:01,330 --> 00:40:10,310
a philosopher of our ages Mr crack total

819
00:40:05,780 --> 00:40:11,300
cyber war because once you are already

820
00:40:10,310 --> 00:40:14,960
in conflict

821
00:40:11,300 --> 00:40:17,450
once you enter total war if you're

822
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:19,100
already in conflict where kinetic power

823
00:40:17,450 --> 00:40:21,350
is at play nothing restricts you from

824
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:26,509
using cyber power to the full extent

825
00:40:21,350 --> 00:40:31,610
that you have it at your disposal with

826
00:40:26,510 --> 00:40:35,030
that I'd like to end by thanking you

827
00:40:31,610 --> 00:40:37,700
about the work that we the people in our

828
00:40:35,030 --> 00:40:40,880
line of business do because rarely is

829
00:40:37,700 --> 00:40:44,140
anyone thanked for the work they did to

830
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:47,450
prevent the disaster that did not happen

831
00:40:44,140 --> 00:40:49,040
and this I believe is more true in our

832
00:40:47,450 --> 00:40:52,220
line of business than in most other

833
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:57,230
businesses anywhere because what we do

834
00:40:52,220 --> 00:40:59,990
is like Tetris it's like Tetris when

835
00:40:57,230 --> 00:41:04,300
you're successful the success disappears

836
00:40:59,990 --> 00:41:04,299
when you screw up the mistakes pile up

837
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:10,719
thank you for your work

838
00:41:07,610 --> 00:41:10,719
[Applause]

839
00:41:14,260 --> 00:41:19,460
and now we open it up for questions we

840
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:21,410
have microphones here at the coroners

841
00:41:19,460 --> 00:41:22,580
please walk to the mic and we'll get the

842
00:41:21,410 --> 00:41:24,879
questions in we have a couple of minutes

843
00:41:22,580 --> 00:41:24,880
for questions

844
00:41:27,670 --> 00:41:30,840
[Music]

845
00:41:38,220 --> 00:41:47,140
any questions we have a question coming

846
00:41:44,260 --> 00:41:50,080
up over there thank you very much this

847
00:41:47,140 --> 00:41:52,600
isn't related to kinetic missiles but I

848
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:55,330
just wanted your opinion on and there's

849
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:58,450
a bill that's going through in the US on

850
00:41:55,330 --> 00:42:01,540
act back and how private organizations

851
00:41:58,450 --> 00:42:03,580
take offensive measures against

852
00:42:01,540 --> 00:42:07,240
potential nation-states that might be

853
00:42:03,580 --> 00:42:10,690
attacking so you mean private companies

854
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:17,259
using offensive response the term is

855
00:42:10,690 --> 00:42:19,690
hack back yeah yeah that is I think it's

856
00:42:17,260 --> 00:42:25,000
more really a question for lawyers than

857
00:42:19,690 --> 00:42:27,190
people in technology responding to an

858
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:28,840
active attack by hacking back in one way

859
00:42:27,190 --> 00:42:29,410
or other isn't really technically very

860
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:31,450
hard

861
00:42:29,410 --> 00:42:33,220
you have the same attribution problem

862
00:42:31,450 --> 00:42:35,439
you might be attacking back against the

863
00:42:33,220 --> 00:42:37,270
wrong target but if you're certain who

864
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:38,500
the attacker is of course you can attack

865
00:42:37,270 --> 00:42:41,560
back maybe even steal your own

866
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:43,240
information back but then lawyers might

867
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:44,290
disagree with what you're doing we

868
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:45,970
actually had a very interesting

869
00:42:44,290 --> 00:42:49,029
discussion about this within our company

870
00:42:45,970 --> 00:42:51,069
as we were discussing some ideas about

871
00:42:49,030 --> 00:42:54,310
collecting information about attackers

872
00:42:51,070 --> 00:42:57,970
with booby-trapped systems and law

873
00:42:54,310 --> 00:43:01,000
lawyer brought up a old case about a guy

874
00:42:57,970 --> 00:43:03,279
who had a summer cottage which kept on

875
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:06,310
getting burglarized so he built a trap

876
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:08,020
system which actually had a rifle right

877
00:43:06,310 --> 00:43:11,350
behind the door and the next burglar got

878
00:43:08,020 --> 00:43:13,240
killed and this was their reason why

879
00:43:11,350 --> 00:43:15,220
they believed we shouldn't be building

880
00:43:13,240 --> 00:43:16,870
hack pack systems which I'm not really

881
00:43:15,220 --> 00:43:19,480
sure if I agree but that's the argument

882
00:43:16,870 --> 00:43:24,100
they had we have another question from

883
00:43:19,480 --> 00:43:27,250
there thank you yes with the issue of

884
00:43:24,100 --> 00:43:29,799
attribution we see actual attacks like

885
00:43:27,250 --> 00:43:32,560
the chemical attacks in Syria create an

886
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:36,310
issue of attribution there if there is

887
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:39,430
an asymmetric domain such as cyber how

888
00:43:36,310 --> 00:43:41,740
do we prevent attribution and those

889
00:43:39,430 --> 00:43:45,830
false flag attacks from small actors

890
00:43:41,740 --> 00:43:49,279
that which de carros large-scale complex

891
00:43:45,830 --> 00:43:52,069
there is no easy solution into into

892
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:54,140
fixing this you can imagine yourself

893
00:43:52,070 --> 00:43:57,020
trying to build a false flag attack you

894
00:43:54,140 --> 00:43:58,580
could go through you know jump through

895
00:43:57,020 --> 00:44:00,950
massive amount of hoops to make it very

896
00:43:58,580 --> 00:44:03,470
convincing that the attacker isn't you

897
00:44:00,950 --> 00:44:05,569
but someone else and I don't see any

898
00:44:03,470 --> 00:44:06,980
mechanism because the attackers are not

899
00:44:05,570 --> 00:44:08,330
really listening to what we are telling

900
00:44:06,980 --> 00:44:12,740
them they will definitely figure out

901
00:44:08,330 --> 00:44:15,670
ways to bypass any any any mechanisms

902
00:44:12,740 --> 00:44:19,040
that we are currently used retribution

903
00:44:15,670 --> 00:44:21,710
and this is why I made the conclusion

904
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:23,840
that when you are fighting against an

905
00:44:21,710 --> 00:44:25,610
attacker which is only doing cyber I

906
00:44:23,840 --> 00:44:27,620
don't think we should be responding with

907
00:44:25,610 --> 00:44:29,150
missiles but when it's part of a bigger

908
00:44:27,620 --> 00:44:31,400
conflict then it's pretty obvious what's

909
00:44:29,150 --> 00:44:32,650
at play and who are the attack that of

910
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:36,020
why they are doing what they're doing

911
00:44:32,650 --> 00:44:38,870
most of the attribution work which is

912
00:44:36,020 --> 00:44:40,640
being done nowadays well big part of it

913
00:44:38,870 --> 00:44:42,500
is placed on the victim you look at the

914
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:44,450
attacker you link their different

915
00:44:42,500 --> 00:44:46,730
attacks together you look at who the

916
00:44:44,450 --> 00:44:49,189
victims are and quite often that tells

917
00:44:46,730 --> 00:44:51,560
you who the attacker is but that's not

918
00:44:49,190 --> 00:44:53,660
really strong enough to start shooting

919
00:44:51,560 --> 00:44:55,340
missiles with so this is one of the core

920
00:44:53,660 --> 00:44:59,080
problems we have and I don't really see

921
00:44:55,340 --> 00:45:00,530
an easy way of fixing that thank you and

922
00:44:59,080 --> 00:45:03,890
yes please

923
00:45:00,530 --> 00:45:07,220
so there's this sovereign internet law

924
00:45:03,890 --> 00:45:09,259
in Russia with the stated aim to protect

925
00:45:07,220 --> 00:45:09,980
them in case we all decide to shut them

926
00:45:09,260 --> 00:45:13,160
off the internet

927
00:45:09,980 --> 00:45:14,600
they'll still still be fine it also has

928
00:45:13,160 --> 00:45:16,310
the effect that they can choose to shut

929
00:45:14,600 --> 00:45:18,650
themselves off from the internet once

930
00:45:16,310 --> 00:45:22,340
they finish building it out so I picture

931
00:45:18,650 --> 00:45:24,710
a major cyber attack and they flip the

932
00:45:22,340 --> 00:45:30,200
switch so your cyber retaliation is

933
00:45:24,710 --> 00:45:32,720
impossible this freezy idea we often say

934
00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:35,450
that the Internet has no geography that

935
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:36,859
you know there is no there's no disease

936
00:45:35,450 --> 00:45:39,259
there's no borders that's actually not

937
00:45:36,860 --> 00:45:41,710
true internet does have geography and I

938
00:45:39,260 --> 00:45:44,390
actually think the amount of geography

939
00:45:41,710 --> 00:45:46,220
on the Internet is actually increasing

940
00:45:44,390 --> 00:45:47,509
over time if you look at the internet 20

941
00:45:46,220 --> 00:45:50,779
years ago and today we actually have

942
00:45:47,510 --> 00:45:53,240
more borders and more distances between

943
00:45:50,780 --> 00:45:54,110
to two countries on the Internet and

944
00:45:53,240 --> 00:45:58,220
we're actually going to the wrong

945
00:45:54,110 --> 00:45:58,990
direction in in that sense being able to

946
00:45:58,220 --> 00:46:03,919
disc

947
00:45:58,990 --> 00:46:06,319
completely is easy to say hard to do

948
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:08,240
like how do you actually disconnect in a

949
00:46:06,319 --> 00:46:10,160
world where individuals within your

950
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:12,410
country have satellite links which link

951
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:14,420
them to the rest of the world and since

952
00:46:12,410 --> 00:46:16,788
we're speaking about tcp/ip it's enough

953
00:46:14,420 --> 00:46:18,500
to have just a handful of links and then

954
00:46:16,789 --> 00:46:21,079
traffic will reroute to the rest of the

955
00:46:18,500 --> 00:46:23,359
internet within that country so this

956
00:46:21,079 --> 00:46:27,529
connection isn't really something that

957
00:46:23,359 --> 00:46:29,480
most topologies would actually support

958
00:46:27,529 --> 00:46:30,230
you can't actually flip the switch that

959
00:46:29,480 --> 00:46:33,589
easily

960
00:46:30,230 --> 00:46:35,210
yeah sure Russians speak about trying

961
00:46:33,589 --> 00:46:37,308
actually doing a rehearsal while doing

962
00:46:35,210 --> 00:46:39,200
that later this year it's kind of fail I

963
00:46:37,309 --> 00:46:41,509
don't see how they would be able to

964
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:43,848
successfully really disconnect from the

965
00:46:41,509 --> 00:46:47,359
rest of the internet it's it's it's very

966
00:46:43,849 --> 00:46:49,670
hard to do thank you thank you and we'll

967
00:46:47,359 --> 00:46:51,890
have the last question thank you that's

968
00:46:49,670 --> 00:46:54,319
you thank you okay thank you for your

969
00:46:51,890 --> 00:46:56,450
talk really insightful and post some

970
00:46:54,319 --> 00:46:58,009
interesting ideas I am I've been

971
00:46:56,450 --> 00:47:00,160
researching on the universe came to be

972
00:46:58,009 --> 00:47:03,279
research a little bit about the

973
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:06,710
existential threat of cyber warfare

974
00:47:03,279 --> 00:47:09,859
which some US military general is now

975
00:47:06,710 --> 00:47:12,740
playing down in thinking of what they

976
00:47:09,859 --> 00:47:15,970
call the sixth domain which is human

977
00:47:12,740 --> 00:47:19,700
ideas and the idea that the subversion

978
00:47:15,970 --> 00:47:21,649
techniques used with with election

979
00:47:19,700 --> 00:47:24,410
interference for example and that sort

980
00:47:21,650 --> 00:47:25,730
of thing is where a lot of the battles

981
00:47:24,410 --> 00:47:28,220
are taking place so it's not an

982
00:47:25,730 --> 00:47:31,009
existential threat but rather the battle

983
00:47:28,220 --> 00:47:33,049
of ideas and that you have to counter

984
00:47:31,009 --> 00:47:35,059
these propaganda or subversion

985
00:47:33,049 --> 00:47:37,819
techniques in very different ways to

986
00:47:35,059 --> 00:47:39,140
building these traditional weapons we're

987
00:47:37,819 --> 00:47:42,500
wondering if you had any ideas on

988
00:47:39,140 --> 00:47:46,400
management yeah it gets very hard to

989
00:47:42,500 --> 00:47:48,589
define where the actual conflict begins

990
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:50,630
when you introduce or when you include

991
00:47:48,589 --> 00:47:52,819
information operations as part of a

992
00:47:50,630 --> 00:47:54,970
conflict or part of war clearly during

993
00:47:52,819 --> 00:47:57,049
traditional wartime propaganda

994
00:47:54,970 --> 00:47:58,879
information operations or election

995
00:47:57,049 --> 00:48:01,190
meddling would be considered acts of war

996
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:03,380
but when you don't have an active

997
00:48:01,190 --> 00:48:05,180
conflict between two countries and one

998
00:48:03,380 --> 00:48:07,009
country tries to meddle with your

999
00:48:05,180 --> 00:48:08,538
elections is that actually war is that

1000
00:48:07,009 --> 00:48:11,910
something you could retaliate against

1001
00:48:08,539 --> 00:48:15,720
this is very problematic and and

1002
00:48:11,910 --> 00:48:18,509
I don't really see the I don't really

1003
00:48:15,720 --> 00:48:22,200
think that's gonna change sure people's

1004
00:48:18,510 --> 00:48:25,200
minds and owpain opinions are part of

1005
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:28,439
the operations during any conflict but

1006
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:30,660
it's hard to define these as acts of war

1007
00:48:28,440 --> 00:48:32,280
unless there is real war and we have

1008
00:48:30,660 --> 00:48:34,200
less and less real Wars which is of

1009
00:48:32,280 --> 00:48:35,460
course good but it also means that we

1010
00:48:34,200 --> 00:48:36,839
have more and more conflicts which we

1011
00:48:35,460 --> 00:48:39,870
don't actually which is look where

1012
00:48:36,840 --> 00:48:42,120
nobody declares a war Russia and Ukraine

1013
00:48:39,870 --> 00:48:44,100
have been at war for five years

1014
00:48:42,120 --> 00:48:46,109
everybody agrees it's a war there's

1015
00:48:44,100 --> 00:48:50,549
never been a declared war between these

1016
00:48:46,110 --> 00:48:52,910
two countries and with that thank you

1017
00:48:50,550 --> 00:48:52,910
very much
