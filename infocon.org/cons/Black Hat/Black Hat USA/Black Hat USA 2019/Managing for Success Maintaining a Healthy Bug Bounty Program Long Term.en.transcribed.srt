the usual general announcements still

4
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:08,610
apply if you've been in any talks today

5
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:11,460
you know to visit the business hall and

6
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:13,649
so on and I'm going to get us started as

7
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:16,199
quickly as we can so welcome Kim price

8
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:20,670
to the stage to introduce the final talk

9
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:23,160
in our micro summit on bug bounties all

10
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:26,369
right thank you so much for being here

11
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:27,630
today this is our third and final talk

12
00:00:26,369 --> 00:00:29,670
and if you've been here for the previous

13
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:31,948
two you've heard us talk about how to

14
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:33,420
maybe think about do I want to start a

15
00:00:31,949 --> 00:00:36,840
bug bounty getting through some of the

16
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:39,149
marketing talk preparing and then we had

17
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:40,860
a great panel I'm not gonna lie when

18
00:00:39,149 --> 00:00:42,180
they started going off script and the

19
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:44,339
panelists were asking each other

20
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:46,079
questions that made me so happy it felt

21
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:49,140
like hanging out with your friends and

22
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:50,820
having a conversation which is great and

23
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:52,739
now we're up to the third and final

24
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:54,780
session in the bug bounty micro summit

25
00:00:52,739 --> 00:00:57,360
which is so you've got a program and

26
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:59,750
it's been going for a while and how do

27
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:03,059
you keep it successful long term because

28
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:04,739
you know the enthusiasm that researchers

29
00:01:03,059 --> 00:01:06,630
bring when you first launch everyone's

30
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:08,850
excited when you launch it's huge

31
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:10,500
everyone's oh a new program new program

32
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:12,360
let's go work on it and then once you've

33
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:14,130
been around for a while you're like and

34
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:15,570
whatever there that you know I'm sure

35
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:16,949
everybody's picked over it already

36
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:18,330
there's probably nothing there to find

37
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:20,939
anymore so how do you keep people

38
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:23,970
engaged and there's this concept called

39
00:01:20,939 --> 00:01:24,929
gamification and so we have Chloe Brown

40
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:27,900
from bugcrowd

41
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:29,939
here today to talk about how do you keep

42
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:32,100
it healthy long term how do you gamify

43
00:01:29,939 --> 00:01:34,949
the experience and incentivize the

44
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:37,259
reward system but also when do you bring

45
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:39,450
out the banhammer how do you handle the

46
00:01:37,259 --> 00:01:40,409
incidents long-term that start cropping

47
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:43,619
up in programs

48
00:01:40,409 --> 00:01:46,979
Chloe's background before bugcrowd is in

49
00:01:43,619 --> 00:01:50,159
gaming she was a game community manager

50
00:01:46,979 --> 00:01:52,200
and so extensive extensive community

51
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:54,990
management experience that she's brought

52
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:56,520
to bear on the security space and it is

53
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:59,570
my pleasure to introduce her for this

54
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:59,570
next session thank you

55
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:11,530
hi folks so as Kim very kindly spoke my

56
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:14,380
name is Chloe I've worked at bugcrowd

57
00:02:11,530 --> 00:02:18,340
and I currently lead our support and our

58
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:21,519
escalation teams what that means is any

59
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:24,820
time a researcher or a program owner

60
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:31,300
says I need help they're talking to my

61
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:37,000
team and anytime there is a we're seeing

62
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:40,030
something wrong on our program or I'm a

63
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:44,640
researcher and I need to get an answer

64
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:47,350
and I'm being ignored hi guys

65
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:49,839
so it's Kim said I came from video games

66
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:52,030
and my very first industry job that I

67
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:53,680
was getting paid for in games was I was

68
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:57,030
working for the Xbox LIVE enforcement

69
00:02:53,680 --> 00:03:01,120
team so my first job I banned hackers

70
00:02:57,030 --> 00:03:04,180
and now I actively work with them try to

71
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:07,840
get them to play nice try to get them

72
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:09,580
paid reasonably and on time we're gonna

73
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:13,989
come back to that particular on time

74
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:16,989
comment in a little bit I'm going the

75
00:03:13,989 --> 00:03:21,880
right way oh and by the way I like cats

76
00:03:16,989 --> 00:03:25,330
so first and foremost we're gonna talk

77
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:27,989
about incentive ization and how once

78
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:32,140
you've figured out what your bounty

79
00:03:27,989 --> 00:03:35,530
budget is how you grow that over time

80
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:38,429
how you can mix and match with different

81
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:44,200
types of incentive options and

82
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:47,170
understand that what starts as being a

83
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:50,170
core motivator for researchers very

84
00:03:47,170 --> 00:03:52,720
commonly cash isn't always the thing

85
00:03:50,170 --> 00:03:55,000
that they're always going to want yes

86
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:57,370
everybody likes getting paid let's face

87
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,590
it core understanding right everybody

88
00:03:57,370 --> 00:04:02,280
wants to get paid for the reasonable

89
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:05,410
work that they have reasonably done and

90
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:09,670
reasonably disclosed to your team well

91
00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:11,170
that's not the only thing there is you

92
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:14,079
have options we're gonna talk about

93
00:04:11,170 --> 00:04:16,539
patch we're gonna talk about

94
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:19,930
swag we're going to talk about

95
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:22,090
collaboration opportunities and finally

96
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:30,190
we're gonna talk about that very dirty

97
00:04:22,089 --> 00:04:31,989
dirty word called disclosure so I want

98
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:34,030
to be that cat can you imagine having

99
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:38,530
swag like that cool

100
00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:41,830
so cash rewards this is the easiest

101
00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:44,169
thing that you can offer as a reward for

102
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:46,960
your program you have a budget that

103
00:04:44,170 --> 00:04:48,850
budget translates into dollars you pay

104
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:51,489
those dollars out through whatever means

105
00:04:48,850 --> 00:04:53,110
whether using a payment vendor or your

106
00:04:51,490 --> 00:04:53,980
team or you know you're doing it

107
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:58,480
yourself

108
00:04:53,980 --> 00:05:00,310
but those cash rewards you know we've

109
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:03,550
talked a little bit about earlier today

110
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:06,430
you know you have to build those up over

111
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:09,520
time so you have to understand where to

112
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:12,370
start your rewards so that you have the

113
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:14,560
ability to grow them and that isn't

114
00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:16,690
necessarily a thing that you're going to

115
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:19,510
grow in the first six months the first

116
00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:22,120
year but as you report you receive

117
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:25,120
reports and those reports get fixed and

118
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:27,310
your product hopefully becomes harder

119
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:29,080
and more mature the researchers are

120
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:31,750
gonna have to work harder they're gonna

121
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:33,729
have to invest more of their time into

122
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:36,610
your code to find the vulnerabilities

123
00:05:33,730 --> 00:05:39,160
that is a great thing but that

124
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:43,360
investment of time needs to have a

125
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:45,450
corresponding payoff and so if you you

126
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:48,220
know your top payout started at say

127
00:05:45,450 --> 00:05:52,510
fifteen hundred dollars when you first

128
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:55,000
started five years ago if your code has

129
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:57,580
benefited from hundreds and hundreds or

130
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,919
thousands or more of researchers

131
00:05:57,580 --> 00:06:01,060
reporting and you fixing things is going

132
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:03,820
to be harder for them to go find

133
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:07,150
something so that hope that top reward

134
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:12,460
and also the bottom rewards should be

135
00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:15,489
uplifted over time swag seems like one

136
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:17,650
of the easiest things going out there

137
00:06:15,490 --> 00:06:19,600
and it has some great benefits you are

138
00:06:17,650 --> 00:06:23,169
literally giving the researchers a

139
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:25,960
physical reminder of your program so

140
00:06:23,169 --> 00:06:27,490
that you can go and see them on Twitter

141
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:29,109
cuz everybody

142
00:06:27,490 --> 00:06:30,729
getting their swag package they open it

143
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:32,590
up it's on Twitter or on Facebook or

144
00:06:30,729 --> 00:06:35,110
their blogs wherever the case may be

145
00:06:32,590 --> 00:06:37,419
they wrap it at conferences especially

146
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:39,849
if you get those really soft and

147
00:06:37,419 --> 00:06:41,400
comfortable t-shirts those are the core

148
00:06:39,849 --> 00:06:44,199
ones that you know you want to get

149
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:46,960
backpacks anything that you can put your

150
00:06:44,199 --> 00:06:51,330
name on there that could be potentially

151
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:54,580
brought to a conference that's key also

152
00:06:51,330 --> 00:06:58,469
researchers grow up over time I'm

153
00:06:54,580 --> 00:07:01,120
telling you now baby bibs ones these

154
00:06:58,470 --> 00:07:02,380
children sides t-shirts you do not

155
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:04,930
understand how much it been killing

156
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:06,909
those like the researchers respond to

157
00:07:04,930 --> 00:07:09,520
those incredibly because researchers

158
00:07:06,909 --> 00:07:11,830
have families and they like seeing that

159
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:13,240
if they enjoy the program that they're

160
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:16,409
working on they like seeing their kids

161
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:20,759
in it and a cute kid in a cute t-shirt

162
00:07:16,409 --> 00:07:25,719
that plays really well on social media

163
00:07:20,759 --> 00:07:29,080
okay so the slightly more advanced

164
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:30,849
options if you will that definitely are

165
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:33,120
not something you necessarily want to

166
00:07:30,849 --> 00:07:35,430
start with in your first year is

167
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:38,620
collaboration opportunities and

168
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:40,960
disclosure disclosure is not a dirty

169
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:45,400
word in the way that I am using it but I

170
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:47,859
use it very broadly there are some teams

171
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:49,508
some products that can't be talked about

172
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:52,120
that they are when they're running a

173
00:07:49,509 --> 00:07:55,240
program they're private for whatever

174
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:57,150
reason government unreleased unannounced

175
00:07:55,240 --> 00:08:00,840
product we still want to get them tested

176
00:07:57,150 --> 00:08:03,159
but there isn't a way for you to say

177
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:04,630
this is like the place where I'm

178
00:08:03,159 --> 00:08:07,690
allowing everybody to come test on it

179
00:08:04,630 --> 00:08:09,759
well you can talk about the fact that

180
00:08:07,690 --> 00:08:12,729
you care about security by having

181
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:14,620
something like a Hall of Fame where you

182
00:08:12,729 --> 00:08:17,409
credit that somebody found something

183
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:20,650
reported it it was fixed a leaderboard

184
00:08:17,409 --> 00:08:24,219
if you're a little bit more advanced

185
00:08:20,650 --> 00:08:26,258
which will show hey over time these are

186
00:08:24,219 --> 00:08:29,409
the folks who have provided the most

187
00:08:26,259 --> 00:08:33,610
value to us perhaps you decide you want

188
00:08:29,409 --> 00:08:36,130
to run an incentive where you know for a

189
00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:38,529
specific period of time this one product

190
00:08:36,130 --> 00:08:39,179
over here over all of the rest is going

191
00:08:38,529 --> 00:08:42,240
to have an

192
00:08:39,179 --> 00:08:44,279
bonus so the person who finds the most

193
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:47,880
are the top three people who find the

194
00:08:44,279 --> 00:08:50,130
most bugs in that specific focus could

195
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:52,380
then you know get an additional prize

196
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:53,880
and there's there's a you know maybe run

197
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:56,310
it for a month or a couple you know two

198
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:58,140
months no over the end of that period of

199
00:08:56,310 --> 00:09:01,260
time they're competing with each other

200
00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:03,380
and you get recognition that way all

201
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:04,939
right the panel mentioned a little bit

202
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:07,410
CDEs

203
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:09,959
requests for technical write-ups or

204
00:09:07,410 --> 00:09:12,480
permission to when they're interviewing

205
00:09:09,959 --> 00:09:15,149
speak about their their vulnerability is

206
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:17,160
how they found them their processes well

207
00:09:15,149 --> 00:09:19,709
it's a type of disclosure and if they

208
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:23,189
come to you and say here's the area in

209
00:09:19,709 --> 00:09:25,800
which I'm I'm using this information may

210
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:28,380
I have your permission to do so it's

211
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:30,599
certainly of their benefit but the the

212
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:33,270
disclosure possibility is is semi

213
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:36,270
limited I'm certainly giving permission

214
00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:39,149
to someone to speak about their content

215
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:43,560
of their vulnerabilities at a place like

216
00:09:39,149 --> 00:09:45,330
black hat or no con or recon any of the

217
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:47,369
cons any of the security ones just had

218
00:09:45,330 --> 00:09:49,850
to attach a con to it right how many of

219
00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:52,709
those are there those opportunities

220
00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:55,260
allow a researcher to stand up and very

221
00:09:52,709 --> 00:09:57,719
proudly say I found a thing that was

222
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:59,459
really cool got paid for it they didn't

223
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:02,550
get paid for it's not the point it's I

224
00:09:59,459 --> 00:10:05,189
want to share this information with

225
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:07,170
another researcher for one usually one

226
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:09,150
of two purposes yeah I want to be able

227
00:10:07,170 --> 00:10:10,860
to brag about it let's face it we're

228
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:13,380
humans we like taking credit for things

229
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:16,709
the other one is I want to be able to

230
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:19,640
give back to a community who very likely

231
00:10:16,709 --> 00:10:22,079
helped me get started

232
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:24,240
hackers you know we have the stereotype

233
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:25,500
of they live in their dark little

234
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,400
basements I've got their hoodies over

235
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:28,980
the head and they never talk to anybody

236
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:31,790
the reality is is they talk all the time

237
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:34,279
and that also comes back to play when

238
00:10:31,790 --> 00:10:37,620
maybe the relationship isn't so great

239
00:10:34,279 --> 00:10:39,839
but what it allows in this instance when

240
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:41,970
we're talking about collaboration is it

241
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:45,300
allows a researcher who is banging their

242
00:10:41,970 --> 00:10:47,339
head against a wall going I don't know

243
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:50,130
what I'm doing wrong that I'm blocked

244
00:10:47,339 --> 00:10:52,050
and I know there's a thing here they can

245
00:10:50,130 --> 00:10:52,710
go to another friend another researcher

246
00:10:52,050 --> 00:10:54,689
someone

247
00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:58,050
may have a little bit more specialized

248
00:10:54,690 --> 00:10:59,940
skills or advanced skills and say can

249
00:10:58,050 --> 00:11:02,990
you help me out can you take a look at

250
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:05,880
what I'm doing and tell me what's next

251
00:11:02,990 --> 00:11:07,770
now this comes into play with probably

252
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:10,200
what is the most advanced type of

253
00:11:07,770 --> 00:11:13,050
incentivization process that you can

254
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:15,960
have which is running an on-site

255
00:11:13,050 --> 00:11:18,890
hackathon or bug bash where you are

256
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:23,360
bringing potentially you know a couple

257
00:11:18,890 --> 00:11:26,240
50 200 researchers into one environment

258
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:29,720
and bringing your development team and

259
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:32,520
letting those two groups mix together

260
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:36,050
letting your development team actually

261
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:39,240
walk around and watch hackers work and

262
00:11:36,050 --> 00:11:41,880
understand how they get to all the

263
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:43,380
various process of you know this is

264
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:45,000
where I start and these are the scans

265
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:47,280
that I run and this is the text that I

266
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,980
use and all of that that is invaluable

267
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:52,699
to understand how an attacker is

268
00:11:49,980 --> 00:12:01,200
actually coming into your environment

269
00:11:52,700 --> 00:12:04,190
all right so talk a little bit about how

270
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:07,530
to keep researchers around and engaged

271
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:10,710
talk a little bit about growing that

272
00:12:07,530 --> 00:12:16,260
that engagement over time is that you

273
00:12:10,710 --> 00:12:19,380
always need to acquisition new how do

274
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:22,530
you start building the trust that you

275
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:26,910
need to actually keep researchers coming

276
00:12:22,530 --> 00:12:28,800
back as we know the idea of pay early

277
00:12:26,910 --> 00:12:32,810
and often I'm gonna come back to that

278
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:35,069
one there is also a concept though of

279
00:12:32,810 --> 00:12:38,040
the trust that you're expecting

280
00:12:35,070 --> 00:12:41,940
researchers to offer you they're looking

281
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:45,839
for the same thing back panel mentioned

282
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:48,210
you know that program owners step in and

283
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:49,920
they think researcher they have all the

284
00:12:48,210 --> 00:12:51,660
power in this you know this relationship

285
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:54,150
they're the ones that can go and

286
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:59,209
disclose they can cause us from that's

287
00:12:54,150 --> 00:13:02,939
true you're the ones who hold the cash

288
00:12:59,210 --> 00:13:05,190
you're the ones who literally are making

289
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:09,540
or breaking them being able to pay their

290
00:13:05,190 --> 00:13:11,490
Bill's to advance their careers to

291
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:15,150
potentially move out of being a

292
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:16,380
researcher and get into security as a

293
00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:20,120
full-time job

294
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:26,400
that shift in thinking that Trust goes

295
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:29,250
both ways is really important if you

296
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:31,530
think about marketing sir 101 it is

297
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:33,900
always more expensive to go out and find

298
00:13:31,530 --> 00:13:36,050
a new customer than it is to retain a

299
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:38,730
customer who's actually already there

300
00:13:36,050 --> 00:13:40,740
well the researchers look at that the

301
00:13:38,730 --> 00:13:42,860
same to think about it they have gone

302
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:45,150
potentially through all this trouble

303
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:49,020
writing up a report for you

304
00:13:45,150 --> 00:13:50,220
proving a POC reporting it potentially

305
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:52,170
working with your team to provide

306
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:55,050
additional information after that

307
00:13:52,170 --> 00:13:59,219
reports been made and then the

308
00:13:55,050 --> 00:14:02,250
experience starts to stumble well

309
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:04,470
they're going alright so where's my

310
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:07,500
return on investment and I'm not just

311
00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:09,060
talking about the cash that's time and

312
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:12,330
energy and effort that could have been

313
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:14,189
put into a different program but when

314
00:14:12,330 --> 00:14:16,830
you find a program you want to work on a

315
00:14:14,190 --> 00:14:19,500
product that excites you a team that

316
00:14:16,830 --> 00:14:21,180
seems to care you want to continue to

317
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:22,860
work there you don't want to have to go

318
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:31,099
and continuously rebuild those

319
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:31,100
relationships everywhere you work so

320
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:38,520
relationships are complicated no matter

321
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:40,319
whether it's a friendship a romantic

322
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:43,800
relationship or a business relationship

323
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:46,380
and bug bounty programs or a business

324
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:49,560
relationship relationships are

325
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:51,020
complicated so we're gonna talk a little

326
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:57,000
bit about being transparent

327
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:59,460
communication is required keeping it

328
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:03,089
fresh how do you keep a program growing

329
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:05,490
and seeing is seeing new things come

330
00:15:03,089 --> 00:15:09,270
into it so where your reward

331
00:15:05,490 --> 00:15:11,100
expectations are and then that's the

332
00:15:09,270 --> 00:15:15,740
thing that we said we would come back to

333
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:18,110
which is rewarding in a timely manner so

334
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:21,440
researchers starts

335
00:15:18,110 --> 00:15:23,420
by submitting lower-level bugs to your

336
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:25,370
program just to see how your team

337
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:28,219
responds what is their experience going

338
00:15:25,370 --> 00:15:32,300
to be working with your team so what's

339
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:36,070
your time to triage what's your time to

340
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:38,479
have that that triage but be accepted

341
00:15:36,070 --> 00:15:42,920
what's the time to have their rewards

342
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:44,380
processed does the team engage on the

343
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:47,149
submission ask for more information

344
00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:50,720
provide feedback if it's not a bug that

345
00:15:47,149 --> 00:15:53,320
they're interested in receiving um do

346
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:57,410
the reported vulnerabilities get fixed

347
00:15:53,320 --> 00:16:03,709
do you pass that information back to the

348
00:15:57,410 --> 00:16:05,300
researcher so how do you keep it fresh

349
00:16:03,709 --> 00:16:09,109
alright sorry how do you how do you keep

350
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:11,120
a transparent share documentation think

351
00:16:09,110 --> 00:16:15,980
about it you stand up a page and say we

352
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:18,470
accept stuff on these products okay how

353
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:21,200
do you set those up do you have

354
00:16:18,470 --> 00:16:23,120
credentials or you know a login system

355
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:26,360
that you have to get into that does it

356
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:29,390
require anything specific or unique to

357
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:31,399
get into the thing that you're actually

358
00:16:29,390 --> 00:16:34,970
interested in talking about you have

359
00:16:31,399 --> 00:16:37,250
api's you have an application that you

360
00:16:34,970 --> 00:16:40,250
could list right there on the page and

361
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:43,630
say go to this particular app store and

362
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:43,630
download and go for it

363
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:50,930
when you've got the documentation do you

364
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:54,440
share whether your code base is getting

365
00:16:50,930 --> 00:16:58,370
updated do you have your change log in

366
00:16:54,440 --> 00:17:01,610
an easily accessible area both of those

367
00:16:58,370 --> 00:17:03,320
tell an existing researcher one that's

368
00:17:01,610 --> 00:17:05,780
actively working on your program

369
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:08,480
hey there's new stuff here potentially

370
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:10,879
you should go take a look it also has

371
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:13,370
the added benefit of hey researcher who

372
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:16,400
I haven't heard from in six months we

373
00:17:13,369 --> 00:17:20,149
just pushed a brand new like huge

374
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:23,449
massive version update come back and

375
00:17:20,150 --> 00:17:26,659
take a look you've had success before we

376
00:17:23,449 --> 00:17:29,210
want to hear from you again

377
00:17:26,659 --> 00:17:30,590
finally and this can be a touchy subject

378
00:17:29,210 --> 00:17:35,539
and I understand that

379
00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:36,369
share your known issues say that once

380
00:17:35,539 --> 00:17:41,749
more

381
00:17:36,369 --> 00:17:45,408
share your known issues there are two

382
00:17:41,749 --> 00:17:47,450
primary reasons for that one if a

383
00:17:45,409 --> 00:17:49,009
researcher is doing a lot of work and

384
00:17:47,450 --> 00:17:53,330
there's a chance that they're gonna get

385
00:17:49,009 --> 00:17:56,359
duplicated tell them that sets an

386
00:17:53,330 --> 00:17:58,220
expectation right there my stuff has

387
00:17:56,359 --> 00:18:00,379
been tested it could be tests a lot

388
00:17:58,220 --> 00:18:03,889
could be tests very little but there's

389
00:18:00,379 --> 00:18:07,279
been testing that allows a researcher to

390
00:18:03,889 --> 00:18:09,889
say all right in this area where there's

391
00:18:07,279 --> 00:18:11,389
a ton of stuff reported those are the

392
00:18:09,889 --> 00:18:13,158
type of vulnerabilities that I actually

393
00:18:11,389 --> 00:18:15,799
really excel at so instead of focusing

394
00:18:13,159 --> 00:18:18,289
on this specific target I'm gonna go to

395
00:18:15,799 --> 00:18:21,590
this one I'm gonna spend my time and my

396
00:18:18,289 --> 00:18:22,580
energy there and see what I can find but

397
00:18:21,590 --> 00:18:23,899
it also does something kind of

398
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:26,869
interesting for more advanced

399
00:18:23,899 --> 00:18:30,738
researchers they look at that and go hmm

400
00:18:26,869 --> 00:18:32,449
that's a challenge for me I want I'm

401
00:18:30,739 --> 00:18:34,489
bored I don't want to just do the easy

402
00:18:32,450 --> 00:18:36,619
stuff I actually want to invest my time

403
00:18:34,489 --> 00:18:37,570
and give myself a challenge and see what

404
00:18:36,619 --> 00:18:40,428
I can find

405
00:18:37,570 --> 00:18:44,570
giving them the best of the both worlds

406
00:18:40,429 --> 00:18:47,359
to allow a researcher to choose from to

407
00:18:44,570 --> 00:18:50,090
say hey sometimes I need some quick cash

408
00:18:47,359 --> 00:18:52,009
I need some easy money I had a you know

409
00:18:50,090 --> 00:18:54,259
a flat tire last week and I had to buy a

410
00:18:52,009 --> 00:18:56,450
brand new tire for my car and I wasn't

411
00:18:54,259 --> 00:18:58,989
expecting that okay well there are a

412
00:18:56,450 --> 00:19:02,509
couple XSS up and you're fine

413
00:18:58,989 --> 00:19:05,659
sometimes it's the all right I've

414
00:19:02,509 --> 00:19:08,139
submitted 16 things to you let's see how

415
00:19:05,659 --> 00:19:10,210
much you've actually improved

416
00:19:08,139 --> 00:19:12,918
researchers have different motivations

417
00:19:10,210 --> 00:19:14,419
they like fixing things they like

418
00:19:12,919 --> 00:19:17,450
breaking things they like solving

419
00:19:14,419 --> 00:19:19,749
puzzles give them different puzzles to

420
00:19:17,450 --> 00:19:19,749
solve

421
00:19:20,769 --> 00:19:30,049
communication is a must that means if

422
00:19:25,879 --> 00:19:32,719
there's a delay be upfront about it just

423
00:19:30,049 --> 00:19:35,239
be a friend say hey you know our

424
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:38,139
programs a little behind this is our

425
00:19:35,239 --> 00:19:40,430
expected timeline develop a

426
00:19:38,139 --> 00:19:43,639
communication cadence

427
00:19:40,430 --> 00:19:45,740
if you are working with the third-party

428
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:48,410
development team perhaps where you don't

429
00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:50,120
own their prioritization queue and you

430
00:19:48,410 --> 00:19:54,470
don't know when they're gonna get to it

431
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:56,899
be honest about it if you can get a

432
00:19:54,470 --> 00:19:59,060
member of that third party team to come

433
00:19:56,900 --> 00:20:01,400
in and be the one to explain it to the

434
00:19:59,060 --> 00:20:05,409
researcher that might actually change

435
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:08,420
how quickly they prioritize the fix I'm

436
00:20:05,410 --> 00:20:12,200
they can't see what is going on behind

437
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:13,790
the screen so they're you know if you go

438
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:19,670
and say all right I'll come back to you

439
00:20:13,790 --> 00:20:22,909
in a week it's two weeks a month six

440
00:20:19,670 --> 00:20:25,580
months that's problem you are heading

441
00:20:22,910 --> 00:20:29,140
for a potential escalation so just be

442
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:32,570
upfront be as transparent as you can be

443
00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:35,570
but Adam had a great comment earlier

444
00:20:32,570 --> 00:20:38,720
which is whatever you post they're going

445
00:20:35,570 --> 00:20:42,050
to take literally and as written in

446
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:43,550
stone so if you're saying I will come

447
00:20:42,050 --> 00:20:45,050
back to you in two weeks you actually

448
00:20:43,550 --> 00:20:46,520
have to come back in two weeks otherwise

449
00:20:45,050 --> 00:20:47,870
they're gonna be blowing up something

450
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:48,920
whether it's your sport team your social

451
00:20:47,870 --> 00:20:52,340
media doesn't matter they will be

452
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:55,130
blowing you up so communication is key

453
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:59,929
as I said it also helps your keep your

454
00:20:55,130 --> 00:21:02,020
development teams once on track one

455
00:20:59,930 --> 00:21:04,490
other comment about using templated

456
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:07,280
answers which Adam also touched on in

457
00:21:04,490 --> 00:21:09,860
his first speech today templated answers

458
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:14,030
are fine the first couple of times but

459
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:17,300
if you're at that six week or more and

460
00:21:14,030 --> 00:21:19,820
you don't have an actual update for them

461
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:21,649
you actually need to change what you're

462
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:24,980
saying because they're gonna get bored

463
00:21:21,650 --> 00:21:27,230
they're gonna walk way back and say you

464
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:28,970
actually don't care you're just giving

465
00:21:27,230 --> 00:21:30,740
me a template let me think about it when

466
00:21:28,970 --> 00:21:32,870
you reach out about something and all

467
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:35,420
you get is a forum answer how much does

468
00:21:32,870 --> 00:21:37,060
that take you off imagine getting that

469
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:39,800
multiple times

470
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:42,409
remember your program is not the only

471
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:44,360
one that they're working on so to make

472
00:21:42,410 --> 00:21:48,620
yourself a differentiator against other

473
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:51,760
programs do better do what you treat

474
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:51,760
them like you would want to be treated

475
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:58,920
keeping it fresh

476
00:21:54,230 --> 00:22:02,130
so the ideal way to do this is of course

477
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:04,170
just add new product add new targets add

478
00:22:02,130 --> 00:22:06,390
new scope okay I understand what that

479
00:22:04,170 --> 00:22:08,430
actually means you have to actually have

480
00:22:06,390 --> 00:22:10,650
new product have new targets have new

481
00:22:08,430 --> 00:22:12,900
scope to add well we already talked a

482
00:22:10,650 --> 00:22:15,030
little bit about the changelog your

483
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:20,930
codebase has changed you've pushed an

484
00:22:15,030 --> 00:22:20,930
update that's new content talked about

485
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:26,990
eventually right now if you have a very

486
00:22:24,390 --> 00:22:31,560
limited scope eventually researchers are

487
00:22:26,990 --> 00:22:33,570
going to run out so what's next well if

488
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:38,429
you know you have something new coming

489
00:22:33,570 --> 00:22:40,919
out you say it's an IOT device you only

490
00:22:38,430 --> 00:22:44,130
have a few limited options on who might

491
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:46,250
be able to test look for a researcher

492
00:22:44,130 --> 00:22:49,670
who's had success on your program before

493
00:22:46,250 --> 00:22:52,260
say hey I got an opportunity for you

494
00:22:49,670 --> 00:22:55,200
it's a relatively exclusive one if you

495
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:57,600
have the ability to do so and pulling a

496
00:22:55,200 --> 00:23:00,090
small group of researchers together to

497
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:03,899
give you a sneak peek to let you get

498
00:23:00,090 --> 00:23:07,260
first crack at this unreleased thing

499
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:10,590
they will jump all over that if they're

500
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:16,790
one thing about devices which I do come

501
00:23:10,590 --> 00:23:19,919
back to um shipping devices is a pain

502
00:23:16,790 --> 00:23:22,260
it's actually just as bad as figuring

503
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:25,830
out if you're shipping swag how you're

504
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:27,480
actually distributing all of that we can

505
00:23:25,830 --> 00:23:30,659
talk more about that offline if anybody

506
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:34,910
is curious it is a pain point but the

507
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:39,810
payoffs can be huge just put that other

508
00:23:34,910 --> 00:23:44,010
set forward expectations I work for a

509
00:23:39,810 --> 00:23:47,370
vendor so I have to interpret many

510
00:23:44,010 --> 00:23:49,530
program breeds all in the space of a

511
00:23:47,370 --> 00:23:52,979
very short period of time any time a

512
00:23:49,530 --> 00:23:57,120
researcher has question look clearer you

513
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:58,970
can be around what you value different

514
00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:02,070
things different targets different

515
00:23:58,970 --> 00:24:04,710
vulnerability types that the better the

516
00:24:02,070 --> 00:24:07,710
researcher can make a decision this is

517
00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:09,600
super important they need to know what

518
00:24:07,710 --> 00:24:11,250
to spend their time they need to know

519
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:13,559
depending on what their current

520
00:24:11,250 --> 00:24:15,809
motivations and needs are where they

521
00:24:13,559 --> 00:24:19,889
should focus their valuable time and

522
00:24:15,809 --> 00:24:23,010
effort panel did mention this but I'm

523
00:24:19,890 --> 00:24:25,710
gonna bring it up again out of scope it

524
00:24:23,010 --> 00:24:27,390
is not enough necessarily to say the

525
00:24:25,710 --> 00:24:29,870
things that we have listed on this page

526
00:24:27,390 --> 00:24:32,730
are in scope

527
00:24:29,870 --> 00:24:34,500
researchers are hackers they like

528
00:24:32,730 --> 00:24:36,960
breaking the rules they like testing

529
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:39,720
those boundaries they will ask about

530
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:44,549
every little thing imaginable Under the

531
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:46,830
Sun that's sometimes good I believe it

532
00:24:44,549 --> 00:24:49,500
was Greg who mentioned well through our

533
00:24:46,830 --> 00:24:50,908
bounty program we discovered we had

534
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:52,380
things we didn't even know about as a

535
00:24:50,909 --> 00:24:54,419
security team okay that's definitely

536
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:57,000
something you want to know about so you

537
00:24:54,419 --> 00:25:01,080
can potentially include or exclude as is

538
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:04,350
necessary you are going to get reports

539
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:08,879
that are out of scope decide as a team

540
00:25:04,350 --> 00:25:11,639
how you're going to handle them I am

541
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:14,850
firmly in the camp that if somebody does

542
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:18,090
good valuable research they should be

543
00:25:14,850 --> 00:25:19,620
compensated accordingly depending on

544
00:25:18,090 --> 00:25:21,510
what your programs reward structure

545
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:23,489
looks like whether it's points cash swag

546
00:25:21,510 --> 00:25:27,419
whatever the case may be that can take

547
00:25:23,490 --> 00:25:30,809
different forms but most researchers and

548
00:25:27,419 --> 00:25:34,440
most of their reports represent hard

549
00:25:30,809 --> 00:25:36,720
work that they put in either creating

550
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:40,799
that POC writing that report doing the

551
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:44,010
art the actual testing so when they find

552
00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:45,990
out because they interpret your brief as

553
00:25:44,010 --> 00:25:47,940
not being super clear that this

554
00:25:45,990 --> 00:25:50,789
particular thing was not actually in

555
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:52,890
scope for reward you can understand why

556
00:25:50,789 --> 00:25:56,250
that's miss set expectation might be

557
00:25:52,890 --> 00:25:57,840
there I am not advocating necessarily

558
00:25:56,250 --> 00:26:01,380
because there are these things called

559
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:04,110
budgets that you just pay everything I

560
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:06,470
you can pay a reduced amount you can

561
00:26:04,110 --> 00:26:09,389
offer another opportunity maybe you

562
00:26:06,470 --> 00:26:12,630
permit them to do a blog a disclosure or

563
00:26:09,390 --> 00:26:14,630
some kind but think of it in in that

564
00:26:12,630 --> 00:26:19,470
terms you know these are not employees

565
00:26:14,630 --> 00:26:21,539
the contractors at best freelancers most

566
00:26:19,470 --> 00:26:24,399
commonly

567
00:26:21,539 --> 00:26:26,499
whatever you decide regarding scope

568
00:26:24,399 --> 00:26:29,309
rewards though stick to the plan

569
00:26:26,499 --> 00:26:32,110
try not to have too many exceptions

570
00:26:29,309 --> 00:26:33,668
unless budget is no issue and you just

571
00:26:32,110 --> 00:26:35,379
have all the money to burn then please

572
00:26:33,669 --> 00:26:36,909
go ahead and reward the researchers will

573
00:26:35,379 --> 00:26:39,820
love your program and probably will

574
00:26:36,909 --> 00:26:43,240
never say a bad thing against you almost

575
00:26:39,820 --> 00:26:47,320
never say bad thing against you yeah

576
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:48,960
there's my point the last thing I'm

577
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:53,428
going to say about rewards which is

578
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:57,009
about how and when you pay them I

579
00:26:53,429 --> 00:26:59,440
strongly recommend after multiple years

580
00:26:57,009 --> 00:27:03,759
of dealing with escalations that you

581
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:05,679
don't wait until a fix is out to give

582
00:27:03,759 --> 00:27:08,039
them the first reward now if you want to

583
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:11,580
talk about paying off after retest

584
00:27:08,039 --> 00:27:13,570
that's that's a different subject but

585
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:16,090
recognizing that they brought you

586
00:27:13,570 --> 00:27:18,639
something of value if you had a

587
00:27:16,090 --> 00:27:20,799
contractor working on your house you're

588
00:27:18,639 --> 00:27:22,149
not going to wait to necessarily the

589
00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:24,629
final finishing to make that first

590
00:27:22,149 --> 00:27:30,850
payment that's not how that works

591
00:27:24,629 --> 00:27:32,110
um there is a large percentage of the

592
00:27:30,850 --> 00:27:34,408
researcher community right now where

593
00:27:32,110 --> 00:27:37,119
this is actually their full-time job

594
00:27:34,409 --> 00:27:39,100
they are paying their bills they're

595
00:27:37,119 --> 00:27:40,658
sending their kids to school they are

596
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:43,840
buying food they're paying for cars

597
00:27:40,659 --> 00:27:46,720
let's be honest with the money that they

598
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:47,580
are making from these programs and you

599
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:50,889
think about it

600
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:54,220
thousand dollars here couple hundred

601
00:27:50,889 --> 00:27:55,629
dollars there the math vast majority of

602
00:27:54,220 --> 00:27:58,570
researchers they're not getting the

603
00:27:55,629 --> 00:28:01,658
10,000 to 20,000 the three hundred

604
00:27:58,570 --> 00:28:05,168
thousand dollar payout yet they're

605
00:28:01,659 --> 00:28:08,710
getting those 150 maybe 200 maybe five

606
00:28:05,169 --> 00:28:12,940
hundred dollar payments now those add up

607
00:28:08,710 --> 00:28:15,340
over time but if you take six months to

608
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:19,539
pay them they're not going to talk to

609
00:28:15,340 --> 00:28:22,570
you for much longer so ultimately when

610
00:28:19,539 --> 00:28:24,610
it comes to building a successful

611
00:28:22,570 --> 00:28:27,369
program it's all about relationship

612
00:28:24,610 --> 00:28:30,219
management you can do that through a

613
00:28:27,369 --> 00:28:31,620
vendor you can do that internally but no

614
00:28:30,220 --> 00:28:34,920
matter what

615
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:36,629
you are paying to manage your

616
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:38,760
relationship whether that be through

617
00:28:36,630 --> 00:28:41,550
your your specific team or through a

618
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:46,230
vendor who helps you know you manage

619
00:28:41,550 --> 00:28:49,770
those rep manage the relationships the

620
00:28:46,230 --> 00:28:52,740
thing that I just said if you choose to

621
00:28:49,770 --> 00:28:55,770
spend time investing into your

622
00:28:52,740 --> 00:29:00,180
researchers and into your program you

623
00:28:55,770 --> 00:29:02,280
will get the same amount back much more

624
00:29:00,180 --> 00:29:05,160
much more strongly they will be loyal

625
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:06,840
they will want to work they will bring

626
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:09,360
things to you that you had no idea was

627
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:12,959
out there and say so I found a thing I

628
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:15,959
know it's not in reward but I feel

629
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:17,970
obligated to tell you about this before

630
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:20,070
you know it gets out anywhere else

631
00:29:17,970 --> 00:29:23,280
because it's that important for you guys

632
00:29:20,070 --> 00:29:26,809
to go consider fixing I mean what kind

633
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:31,710
of a better relationship than that right

634
00:29:26,809 --> 00:29:34,100
okay so that's the trust side what

635
00:29:31,710 --> 00:29:38,520
happens when that trust boat gets rocked

636
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:43,459
because it's gonna you betrayed my tiny

637
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:43,460
trust I feel bad for the cat

638
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:49,500
I'm waiting so she can take a picture

639
00:29:45,990 --> 00:29:51,360
and welcome alright so when a critical

640
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:53,490
vulnerability comes in as a report you

641
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:55,020
probably have an incident report team

642
00:29:53,490 --> 00:29:57,780
spun up within your development teams

643
00:29:55,020 --> 00:30:01,410
you know how to actually go forth and

644
00:29:57,780 --> 00:30:04,620
get ready to fix it what about the rest

645
00:30:01,410 --> 00:30:07,380
of your company what about your support

646
00:30:04,620 --> 00:30:09,300
team who may have gotten this escalation

647
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:12,179
notification coming into there's your

648
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:16,889
support portal and they're like yeah and

649
00:30:12,179 --> 00:30:20,150
let's see injection what's remote code

650
00:30:16,890 --> 00:30:23,160
execution what do we do with this thing

651
00:30:20,150 --> 00:30:25,110
talk to your social media teams talk to

652
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:28,320
your support teams they are often the

653
00:30:25,110 --> 00:30:30,240
first people externally well they're the

654
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:33,720
internal people who are dealing with the

655
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:35,190
external like incoming message of hey

656
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:38,640
you know what I'm really tired of you

657
00:30:35,190 --> 00:30:41,820
ignoring me for six weeks for six months

658
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:43,950
whatever the timeline is I'm now making

659
00:30:41,820 --> 00:30:45,029
a public that you don't care that I

660
00:30:43,950 --> 00:30:48,979
reported something

661
00:30:45,029 --> 00:30:51,539
of whatever criticality I don't care

662
00:30:48,979 --> 00:30:52,739
internet doesn't care they don't know

663
00:30:51,539 --> 00:30:54,289
the difference between a lot of these

664
00:30:52,739 --> 00:30:58,019
things we see that every day

665
00:30:54,289 --> 00:31:00,479
so educate your internal teams have a

666
00:30:58,019 --> 00:31:03,659
conversation with your PR in your

667
00:31:00,479 --> 00:31:05,339
communication teams before you start the

668
00:31:03,659 --> 00:31:07,079
bounty program so you can experiment

669
00:31:05,339 --> 00:31:10,349
give them a bit of education on what

670
00:31:07,079 --> 00:31:13,129
thing what type of problems they might

671
00:31:10,349 --> 00:31:16,259
have to be responding to do they have to

672
00:31:13,129 --> 00:31:18,748
excuse me talk to stakeholders do they

673
00:31:16,259 --> 00:31:22,289
have to talk to customers and say so we

674
00:31:18,749 --> 00:31:24,869
had a thing we fix the thing here's how

675
00:31:22,289 --> 00:31:27,389
you go fix yourself whether we push a

676
00:31:24,869 --> 00:31:29,069
patch and we download it or hey we've

677
00:31:27,389 --> 00:31:31,049
already rolled out the fix doesn't even

678
00:31:29,069 --> 00:31:32,938
matter you don't have to do anything at

679
00:31:31,049 --> 00:31:34,649
this point those are the best kind of

680
00:31:32,939 --> 00:31:35,729
communications to send but they're not

681
00:31:34,649 --> 00:31:38,998
always the ones that you're gonna be

682
00:31:35,729 --> 00:31:40,469
able to do zero days those your peer and

683
00:31:38,999 --> 00:31:41,969
your communication teams there's other

684
00:31:40,469 --> 00:31:44,459
ones that are getting hit the hardest if

685
00:31:41,969 --> 00:31:47,009
they have no concept of this security

686
00:31:44,459 --> 00:31:49,349
thing and it just gets slammed into them

687
00:31:47,009 --> 00:31:50,939
they are going to be running around like

688
00:31:49,349 --> 00:31:52,708
chickens with their heads cut off very

689
00:31:50,939 --> 00:31:54,629
nice people I'm very sure but they have

690
00:31:52,709 --> 00:31:56,369
a right to be panicking at that point

691
00:31:54,629 --> 00:31:58,708
bring them in

692
00:31:56,369 --> 00:32:01,529
educate them so that they can not only

693
00:31:58,709 --> 00:32:04,289
prepare correctly but also understand

694
00:32:01,529 --> 00:32:06,269
the seriousness of why this happened

695
00:32:04,289 --> 00:32:08,279
what we're doing about it

696
00:32:06,269 --> 00:32:12,169
and why in the future a bug bounty

697
00:32:08,279 --> 00:32:12,169
program actually should help avoid that

698
00:32:12,439 --> 00:32:22,159
most importantly stay calm your team

699
00:32:17,999 --> 00:32:26,369
members your development teams your PR

700
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:29,549
everybody including your c-level they

701
00:32:26,369 --> 00:32:32,599
will feed off of you if you are spun up

702
00:32:29,549 --> 00:32:35,759
it is going to just ripple forward

703
00:32:32,599 --> 00:32:36,829
assume that everybody who is involved in

704
00:32:35,759 --> 00:32:40,129
the situation

705
00:32:36,829 --> 00:32:43,499
wants to improve the situation I

706
00:32:40,129 --> 00:32:45,059
realized after many years of of

707
00:32:43,499 --> 00:32:49,409
escalations it doesn't always seem like

708
00:32:45,059 --> 00:32:52,439
it it really really doesn't um but do

709
00:32:49,409 --> 00:32:54,329
your best to say alright hang on let's

710
00:32:52,439 --> 00:32:58,520
take a step back let's just take a deep

711
00:32:54,329 --> 00:33:02,060
breath and and go forth from there

712
00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:04,790
sarcasm and snark don't translate well

713
00:33:02,060 --> 00:33:09,450
communication online is really hard

714
00:33:04,790 --> 00:33:12,149
really hard many researchers don't speak

715
00:33:09,450 --> 00:33:15,590
English as their first language that

716
00:33:12,150 --> 00:33:18,150
means that they may make a statement

717
00:33:15,590 --> 00:33:20,129
instead of a question and I'm not just

718
00:33:18,150 --> 00:33:21,810
talking about literally missing a

719
00:33:20,130 --> 00:33:24,750
question mark though that will often

720
00:33:21,810 --> 00:33:26,970
happen the the actual grammar and

721
00:33:24,750 --> 00:33:28,110
sentence structure may not be something

722
00:33:26,970 --> 00:33:30,240
because you're working through a

723
00:33:28,110 --> 00:33:32,850
translator or you know whatever your

724
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:35,160
your English lessons have taught you you

725
00:33:32,850 --> 00:33:37,520
are not working in their language of

726
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:42,330
business they are working in yours

727
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:47,639
remember you're a human I think so are

728
00:33:42,330 --> 00:33:50,879
they I think assume that if you were

729
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:52,800
face to face there wasn't that screen in

730
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:55,680
front of you that's how you should be

731
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:59,100
talking to them engaged with them

732
00:33:55,680 --> 00:34:04,140
communicate with them not at them not to

733
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:07,919
them with also there's this lovely thing

734
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:12,570
called don't send until you've reread it

735
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:14,520
like 15 times literally get up go have a

736
00:34:12,570 --> 00:34:17,730
cup of tea take a walk around the block

737
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:19,560
then come back and say you know I'm

738
00:34:17,730 --> 00:34:22,080
gonna take out this sentence because it

739
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:24,090
isn't what I need to be saying right now

740
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:28,199
that works internally also works

741
00:34:24,090 --> 00:34:33,320
externally last piece that I want to

742
00:34:28,199 --> 00:34:37,069
talk about is feedback constructive

743
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:40,879
critical the other kind

744
00:34:37,070 --> 00:34:44,220
if someone's bringing a problem to you

745
00:34:40,879 --> 00:34:46,830
don't just assume that your team is

746
00:34:44,219 --> 00:34:48,120
actually doing this the job that you had

747
00:34:46,830 --> 00:34:50,040
originally decided that they were gonna

748
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:54,060
do actually look into it

749
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:55,620
trust but verify very wise woman told me

750
00:34:54,060 --> 00:34:59,430
that many years ago when I first started

751
00:34:55,620 --> 00:35:01,410
in security live by it everyday take

752
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:05,609
what they are telling you of their

753
00:35:01,410 --> 00:35:07,620
experience at face value I can go dig

754
00:35:05,610 --> 00:35:10,620
into it you may find that's just a

755
00:35:07,620 --> 00:35:11,880
miscommunication you may find that I get

756
00:35:10,620 --> 00:35:15,100
there jumping the gun

757
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:17,830
you may also find that there is actually

758
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:20,680
a serious problem and that's something

759
00:35:17,830 --> 00:35:25,830
that you want to address because one bad

760
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:27,930
apple one bad experience spoils the rest

761
00:35:25,830 --> 00:35:30,940
researchers talk to each other

762
00:35:27,930 --> 00:35:32,980
who are you working on right now oh I

763
00:35:30,940 --> 00:35:34,720
just you know don't touch this one I

764
00:35:32,980 --> 00:35:37,690
just had a terrible experience but this

765
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:41,100
program these guys over here they get it

766
00:35:37,690 --> 00:35:42,460
they care they talk they reward on time

767
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:44,920
trust me

768
00:35:42,460 --> 00:35:47,640
rewarding on time is probably the single

769
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:50,550
best thing you can do to just circumvent

770
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:52,810
even if you've had a really contentious

771
00:35:50,550 --> 00:35:56,400
submission and and back and forth with

772
00:35:52,810 --> 00:35:59,710
researchers paying them fairly

773
00:35:56,400 --> 00:36:03,100
reasonably in a reasonable amount of

774
00:35:59,710 --> 00:36:05,050
time solves a lot of problems it isn't

775
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:07,450
that they're it's the problem is solved

776
00:36:05,050 --> 00:36:10,630
or the miscommunication and salt but it

777
00:36:07,450 --> 00:36:12,970
D escalates they can go on and look at

778
00:36:10,630 --> 00:36:19,840
the next thing you can go on and

779
00:36:12,970 --> 00:36:23,350
actually start fixing looking so that is

780
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:25,810
my presentation for today it has come to

781
00:36:23,350 --> 00:36:27,310
an end thank you so much for anyone who

782
00:36:25,810 --> 00:36:27,850
has actually sat through all three

783
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:30,130
pieces

784
00:36:27,850 --> 00:36:32,650
we very much appreciate you joining us

785
00:36:30,130 --> 00:36:44,650
and I hope that you learned a thing or

786
00:36:32,650 --> 00:36:46,240
two so Cheers all right once

787
00:36:44,650 --> 00:36:49,750
thank you so much for coming to the

788
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:51,549
first micro summit on bug bounties at

789
00:36:49,750 --> 00:36:54,880
blackhat we would love your feedback

790
00:36:51,550 --> 00:36:56,620
please fill out feedback forms you know

791
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:58,930
I've been tweeting using the bug bounty

792
00:36:56,620 --> 00:37:00,430
micro summit hashtag so it won't be too

793
00:36:58,930 --> 00:37:03,549
hard to find me if you want to send me

794
00:37:00,430 --> 00:37:06,490
direct messages with feedback you know

795
00:37:03,550 --> 00:37:08,860
positive negative the stories of what

796
00:37:06,490 --> 00:37:10,270
worked for you what didn't I don't know

797
00:37:08,860 --> 00:37:12,250
if we'll do another one of these but I

798
00:37:10,270 --> 00:37:15,250
do know that all of the slides will be

799
00:37:12,250 --> 00:37:18,400
available online I've asked each of the

800
00:37:15,250 --> 00:37:20,260
speakers and participants to take the

801
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:22,600
slides but also just still sort of

802
00:37:20,260 --> 00:37:24,310
checklists so it's more of a punch down

803
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:26,319
list for people who want to take this

804
00:37:24,310 --> 00:37:28,420
back to work and say okay here's here's

805
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:31,810
my next steps and we'll get those

806
00:37:28,420 --> 00:37:33,760
uploaded as well so you know I hope we

807
00:37:31,810 --> 00:37:36,600
continue the conversation as a community

808
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:39,310
and can all work together on how to

809
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:41,259
protect all of our customers through

810
00:37:39,310 --> 00:37:43,670
partnerships with security researchers

811
00:37:41,260 --> 00:37:46,090
and bug bounties Thanks

812
00:37:43,670 --> 00:37:46,090
[Applause]
