1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,410
you're in Jasmine and this session is

2
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:08,730
the future of securing intelligent

3
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:11,550
electronic devices using the IEC 62 351

4
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:14,370
7 standard for monitoring by aundrea

5
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:15,199
Carcano alessandro de Pinto and Llanes

6
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:17,250
dragony

7
00:00:15,199 --> 00:00:21,689
please remember to silence your phones

8
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:24,650
and now please welcome Andrea Carcano I

9
00:00:21,689 --> 00:00:28,580
was hundred to Pinto and Yanis Tregoning

10
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:28,580
thank you thank you so much

11
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:36,660
good morning everyone so today we're

12
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:39,329
gonna have a 25-minute session and the

13
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:41,640
goal of this session is to talk to you

14
00:00:39,329 --> 00:00:43,559
about a standard but we would like to

15
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:45,600
talk to you about that standard in a way

16
00:00:43,559 --> 00:00:48,209
that is very technical as I would like

17
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:51,210
to do stuff with some real example with

18
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:52,469
some real demo so now before getting the

19
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:55,199
presentation let me do a quick

20
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:57,840
introduction about me and my colleagues

21
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:59,940
so i'm andrea Carcano I'm the founder of

22
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:01,559
non Sami networks a company focused on

23
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:06,330
industrial control system cybersecurity

24
00:01:01,559 --> 00:01:08,009
I did a PhD focus on SCADA security at

25
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:09,899
the beginning on the offensive side and

26
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:12,540
then I move on the defensive side and

27
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:14,189
then I worked for almost four years in a

28
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:16,890
Security Operations Center for an oil

29
00:01:14,189 --> 00:01:20,189
and gas company and after that I found I

30
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:24,060
found non-zombie networks hello everyone

31
00:01:20,189 --> 00:01:27,169
I'm Alessandro de Pinto I lead the

32
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:31,259
security research team in Navi networks

33
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:34,619
my background is focused on penetration

34
00:01:31,259 --> 00:01:38,280
testing and reverse engineering hi

35
00:01:34,619 --> 00:01:40,259
everyone my name is Eunice Delaney I'm a

36
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:43,049
co-author of the Triton research

37
00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:45,479
presented last year here blackhat I'm

38
00:01:43,049 --> 00:01:48,270
mainly focused on offensive security in

39
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:50,420
our ability research and I'm also a

40
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:53,699
member of the global shaper community

41
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:55,439
yeah thank you thank you guys so let's

42
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:57,299
go now to talking about a presentation

43
00:01:55,439 --> 00:02:00,479
that we're going to discuss today with

44
00:01:57,299 --> 00:02:02,340
you so a quick a quick agenda about a

45
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:04,679
presentation we would like to just talk

46
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:07,920
very quickly about the state of the art

47
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:09,300
about Smart Grid be focus give you a

48
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:13,620
little bit of knowledge about the

49
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:16,470
standard IEC 62 351

50
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:18,510
and then and then show some real demo

51
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:21,510
example about an infrastructure that we

52
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:24,599
build in our laboratory on some attacks

53
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:26,399
and how that standard can help with the

54
00:02:24,599 --> 00:02:28,049
right tools to identify some

55
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:32,370
sophisticated attacks against an

56
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:33,900
industrial control system so good first

57
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:35,970
of all let me talk about smart grid and

58
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:38,640
I want to start with a very basic

59
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:43,650
question how many of you is familiar

60
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:46,619
about what is a smart grid let's say 50%

61
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:49,230
in the room so very quick just to set a

62
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:51,540
bit of context what is a smart grid so

63
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:53,160
let me start with a grid and then I will

64
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:55,650
tell you what is a smart grid so agree

65
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:57,630
this is everything is that is taking in

66
00:02:55,650 --> 00:03:00,410
constant consideration electric

67
00:02:57,630 --> 00:03:03,540
generation transmission distribution

68
00:03:00,410 --> 00:03:05,450
from the producer to the end-user you

69
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:09,060
know related to energy and electricity

70
00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:10,950
so what is really interesting a concept

71
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:13,650
that is really interesting today is the

72
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:16,140
concept of smart grid so basically the

73
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:18,329
concept of smart grid is is agreed but

74
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:21,510
with the possibility for the end-user to

75
00:03:18,329 --> 00:03:22,319
be an active part in the network so an

76
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:25,108
end-user

77
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:27,958
can produce electricity or can consume

78
00:03:25,109 --> 00:03:30,840
electricity that's something that it's

79
00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:32,910
it's crucial for our future we have a

80
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:34,709
many city all over the world that are

81
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:38,519
running experiments related to smart

82
00:03:34,709 --> 00:03:43,109
grid and and it's it's it's an odd topic

83
00:03:38,519 --> 00:03:45,329
because can improve a lot the efficiency

84
00:03:43,109 --> 00:03:48,389
but also from the cyber security

85
00:03:45,329 --> 00:03:51,000
perspective open up a lot of discussion

86
00:03:48,389 --> 00:03:54,090
from from hacking and defense

87
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:56,099
perspective so why there are some

88
00:03:54,090 --> 00:03:56,970
challenges on smart grid mainly for

89
00:03:56,099 --> 00:03:59,668
three reasons

90
00:03:56,970 --> 00:04:01,620
one is technical challenges so

91
00:03:59,669 --> 00:04:04,250
technology that are there today in the

92
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:08,310
grid were developing many years ago

93
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:11,819
system our Institute by design we don't

94
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:15,780
have protocol you know design for this

95
00:04:11,819 --> 00:04:18,060
type of contest also we are the people

96
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:19,829
people are always a challenge as you

97
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:23,070
know right we are always a challenge on

98
00:04:19,829 --> 00:04:26,060
the cyber security perspective because

99
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:28,320
of training because of lack of knowledge

100
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:30,000
especially now that I mean that we are

101
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:31,740
introducing that concept it will be very

102
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,620
important to invest in invest in people

103
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:37,710
and then of course you know ot solution

104
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:40,020
requirements in general so before the 62

105
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:42,630
351 there was not a standard dedicated

106
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:44,880
to that and we will see in a second what

107
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:46,560
this stander is doing so that's what was

108
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:50,040
the lock until today that we have in

109
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:52,260
this contest now let me go a little bit

110
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:54,330
more in deep talking about the standard

111
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:56,670
and again very quick because I want to

112
00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:58,560
give an hour time for show you some DMO

113
00:04:56,670 --> 00:05:01,230
has some real interesting stuff so

114
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:02,940
related to the standard what is this

115
00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:06,600
standard and in particular I will be

116
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:09,300
focused on the part 7 so first of all we

117
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:12,440
are part of the working group 15 working

118
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:16,200
group 15 is a is an international group

119
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:18,360
working on the standard 62 351 where

120
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:20,310
there is multiple company working on

121
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:25,400
that sander we have company from the

122
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:28,380
automation board Siemens Schneider a BBG

123
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:31,799
Rockwell and so on who have company from

124
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:34,620
the network perspective Cisco

125
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:36,420
Palo Alto juniper and so on and there is

126
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:39,270
company specialized in cyber security

127
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:43,980
like ourself in the Tommy know Tommy

128
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:47,000
so the goal of this entire working group

129
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:49,320
is to try to design a new standard that

130
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,240
taking consideration all the challenge

131
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:54,240
that we have to the cyber on the cyber

132
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:56,940
security perspective for keep our smart

133
00:05:54,240 --> 00:06:00,090
grid secure in particular the standard

134
00:05:56,940 --> 00:06:02,130
is focus on we're going to focus today

135
00:06:00,090 --> 00:06:04,710
on the par 7 the par 7 is the part

136
00:06:02,130 --> 00:06:06,450
relative to monitoring so one of the

137
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:08,190
things they were trying to force in the

138
00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:09,960
stander is the encryption the end-to-end

139
00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:13,350
encryption communication between the

140
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:15,840
different peer inside a smart raid but

141
00:06:13,350 --> 00:06:18,660
let's open up a lots of challenge around

142
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:21,539
how we can really monitor my smart grid

143
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:23,100
how we can get real-time data if I want

144
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:26,160
to monitor the communication of an

145
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:27,780
entire grid that is not maybe related to

146
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,710
just the city but is a related to my

147
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:30,989
entire country

148
00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:34,260
so that's are all challenge that we have

149
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:35,720
in order to you know monitor and get

150
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:38,360
data from

151
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:40,340
from the smart grid perspective so

152
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:43,250
another things that I want to mention is

153
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:45,169
that the part 7 the the part 7 on this

154
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:47,630
standard as I mentioned is focused on

155
00:06:45,170 --> 00:06:50,480
monitoring and you will see in specific

156
00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:53,060
is focused on some protocols that we can

157
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:55,190
find is Madrid so here you have a few

158
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:56,960
example of the protocols today we're

159
00:06:55,190 --> 00:06:59,750
going to show some example related to

160
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:03,049
how this the standard applied to SNMP

161
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:05,660
but it works very well also on the mp3

162
00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:09,050
and other different standards and to

163
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:11,810
summarize the concept is we always be

164
00:07:09,050 --> 00:07:14,720
scared about having active monitoring

165
00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:16,850
inside our network I work for four years

166
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:20,000
in an oil and gas company and I was the

167
00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:21,650
first one not allowing anyone to install

168
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:25,220
an active technology inside the network

169
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:28,580
because technology inside our critical

170
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:31,220
infrastructure are not designed for you

171
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:34,340
know active polling but what about if I

172
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:37,280
will have a standard that is pushing and

173
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:39,799
is by design having the technology ready

174
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:41,869
to get someone asking directly them

175
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:44,120
information so and that is the entire

176
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:48,380
things related to due to this standard

177
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:51,160
so in this case having an active

178
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:54,979
approach with appeal see an art you

179
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:57,470
design from the beginning to receive

180
00:07:54,979 --> 00:07:59,719
query and question around which is your

181
00:07:57,470 --> 00:08:02,300
status how are you doing how many

182
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:04,700
process do you have running inside your

183
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:06,890
system so all these things can give us

184
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:08,659
real-time information that can you know

185
00:08:06,890 --> 00:08:12,140
prevent attacks and give us a better

186
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:15,830
visibility about what we're doing so I

187
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:17,870
want to stop here and I want to pass the

188
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:20,450
baton to my colleague alessandro and

189
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:22,880
what we're gonna do right now is we'll

190
00:08:20,450 --> 00:08:24,620
show you some demo that we build in our

191
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:26,870
laboratory with a physical environment

192
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:30,260
in order to demonstrate how that

193
00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:32,469
standard can be very efficient against

194
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:35,960
some terrorist attacks

195
00:08:32,469 --> 00:08:39,680
ok great let's see the active monitoring

196
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:41,810
in action in the next slides we are

197
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:45,199
going to show you four different

198
00:08:41,809 --> 00:08:47,790
scenarios targeting a real industrial

199
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:54,060
process that actually we have

200
00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:57,719
inside our lab we decided to recreate a

201
00:08:54,060 --> 00:09:01,339
fully working hydro dam process on the

202
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:06,410
right you can see the process itself

203
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:09,290
based on two tanks with water inside

204
00:09:06,410 --> 00:09:13,680
basically the process is that the

205
00:09:09,290 --> 00:09:16,500
pressure of the air pushes the water

206
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:19,859
from the upper tank through the lower

207
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:23,430
one and this create electricity that

208
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:27,410
basically it used to turn on two small

209
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:31,500
lights that you can see in the video the

210
00:09:27,410 --> 00:09:34,050
process is controlled using sensors and

211
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:37,380
flow meters then actually control the

212
00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:41,430
level of the water as soon as the lower

213
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:44,520
tank is full a pump is activated and it

214
00:09:41,430 --> 00:09:49,410
pushes back the water inside the upper

215
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:51,510
tank this allows the process to start

216
00:09:49,410 --> 00:09:54,569
from the beginning

217
00:09:51,510 --> 00:09:59,250
the sensors are connected directly with

218
00:09:54,570 --> 00:10:01,620
the gray device which it is an earth you

219
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:04,620
in charge for control all the oldest

220
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:08,370
system inside the black box we have a

221
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:11,360
classic HMI device used by engineers to

222
00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:14,250
control in real-time the process and

223
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:17,430
finally we have Natsume Guardian

224
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:21,030
appliance using the smart polling in

225
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:26,400
order to actively monitoring all the

226
00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:29,339
network ok demo one in this demo we are

227
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:33,180
going to talk about physical attacks but

228
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:36,750
first of all we need to define who is an

229
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:42,180
attacker in this case the attacker can

230
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:46,230
be or an external attacker or even an

231
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:50,760
internal one so a person who is working

232
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:53,730
inside the inside the company this is

233
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:55,900
really dangerous because people inside

234
00:10:53,730 --> 00:11:01,240
the companies

235
00:10:55,900 --> 00:11:03,610
have access to restricted the area will

236
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:06,370
show you a couple of examples about

237
00:11:03,610 --> 00:11:10,030
physical attacks in the first one the

238
00:11:06,370 --> 00:11:13,540
attacker is going to disconnect

239
00:11:10,030 --> 00:11:15,370
physically a sensor inside the Hydra

240
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:18,870
dime with the main goal to create

241
00:11:15,370 --> 00:11:22,390
disruption inside the inside the process

242
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:25,450
another example could be the same

243
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:28,390
attacker going to target a course which

244
00:11:25,450 --> 00:11:31,690
inside the network with the main purpose

245
00:11:28,390 --> 00:11:36,550
to disconnect the SCADA SCADA system

246
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:42,310
from from the process now let's see it

247
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:44,260
in action we will see the first the

248
00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:47,589
first example based on the sensor

249
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:52,120
unplugged at the top of the other screen

250
00:11:47,590 --> 00:11:56,050
you can see the data collected actively

251
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:59,830
by our system in this case we are going

252
00:11:56,050 --> 00:12:04,719
to to use the second last entry that

253
00:11:59,830 --> 00:12:11,410
basically is it's describing the health

254
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:13,900
of the of the process in the status

255
00:12:11,410 --> 00:12:16,689
actually is the set on ok because the

256
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:18,939
process is working as expected

257
00:12:16,690 --> 00:12:22,360
right now the attacker that actually

258
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:27,850
it's just me is going to unplug

259
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:30,580
physically the sensor this this attacker

260
00:12:27,850 --> 00:12:36,490
is immediately detected by the system

261
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:41,200
and an alert is is rised inside the the

262
00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:45,430
Guardian the key point here is that

263
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:48,550
using the active monitoring approach we

264
00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:52,780
are able to provide detailed information

265
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:55,810
about which sensor inside the inside the

266
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:59,380
process has been disconnected it is

267
00:12:55,810 --> 00:13:03,910
really useful to the engineers in order

268
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:10,689
to reply immediately to the incident

269
00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:12,490
going to the specific sensor okay

270
00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:16,060
in the demo - we are moving on a

271
00:13:12,490 --> 00:13:19,660
software-based attacker where the

272
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:23,650
attacker is basically going to upload a

273
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:28,510
new ladder logic inside there to a

274
00:13:23,650 --> 00:13:32,140
ladder logic is actually a code which

275
00:13:28,510 --> 00:13:36,730
instructs the air to about what the

276
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:40,240
process is in this example the attacker

277
00:13:36,730 --> 00:13:43,300
is not going to change the process but

278
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:45,720
it's just adding new capability to the

279
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:51,449
ladder logic in order to exfiltrate data

280
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:55,330
from the process but this addition is

281
00:13:51,450 --> 00:13:58,780
introducing an override on the CPU and

282
00:13:55,330 --> 00:14:02,290
the memory usage of this ladder logic so

283
00:13:58,780 --> 00:14:05,770
now let's suppose that the normal

284
00:14:02,290 --> 00:14:09,550
passive monitoring systems wasn't able

285
00:14:05,770 --> 00:14:13,420
to detect this attack so the ladder

286
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:17,260
logic is installed inside inside there -

287
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:23,620
we can still detect this malicious

288
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:25,630
ladder using the active approach we are

289
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:29,680
going to use the active approach to

290
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:32,710
monitor the internal status of the of

291
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:34,660
the assets in this case there - this

292
00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:38,560
time we are considering the first two

293
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:42,670
entries of the of the data collected

294
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:47,589
that represents the CPU load and the

295
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:50,550
memory usage of the process we can see

296
00:14:47,590 --> 00:14:54,280
on the right the HMI displaying the

297
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:57,550
normal process to the engineers and in

298
00:14:54,280 --> 00:15:02,100
this normal process we can see that CPU

299
00:14:57,550 --> 00:15:07,329
load is below 2% and the memory usage is

300
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:10,930
below 21% in a couple of seconds the

301
00:15:07,330 --> 00:15:13,270
attacker will start the upload of the

302
00:15:10,930 --> 00:15:17,649
new ladder logic the malicious one okay

303
00:15:13,270 --> 00:15:20,649
now it's uploading it the system

304
00:15:17,649 --> 00:15:23,829
after the upload will immediately detect

305
00:15:20,649 --> 00:15:28,119
a spike in the CPU load and memory usage

306
00:15:23,829 --> 00:15:32,219
and these two indicators are really

307
00:15:28,119 --> 00:15:35,559
useful to detect this kind of threat

308
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:38,759
after a couple of seconds a new alert

309
00:15:35,559 --> 00:15:42,850
will be rised inside Nozomi Guardian

310
00:15:38,759 --> 00:15:46,509
providing information about which was

311
00:15:42,850 --> 00:15:49,149
exactly the problem in our example we

312
00:15:46,509 --> 00:15:52,059
can see that engineers have been

313
00:15:49,149 --> 00:15:54,879
provided about information like the cpu

314
00:15:52,059 --> 00:16:00,929
load and the memory usage was too high

315
00:15:54,879 --> 00:16:00,929
for the device I looks the earth you

316
00:16:04,139 --> 00:16:10,050
okay so let's move to the next scenario

317
00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:14,800
so it's going to be another another

318
00:16:12,550 --> 00:16:16,329
physical scenario but first of all how

319
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:21,309
many here in the audience have heard

320
00:16:16,329 --> 00:16:24,160
about cyber squirrels okay so cyber

321
00:16:21,309 --> 00:16:27,399
squirrel one.com is one of my favorite

322
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:29,829
sites because it is a collection of all

323
00:16:27,399 --> 00:16:32,199
different attacks that our critical

324
00:16:29,829 --> 00:16:34,179
infrastructures receive all over the

325
00:16:32,199 --> 00:16:36,490
world from an interesting type of

326
00:16:34,179 --> 00:16:37,449
threats that our animals it could be

327
00:16:36,490 --> 00:16:40,300
Squealer

328
00:16:37,449 --> 00:16:42,128
rats snakes that could target our

329
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:44,319
critical infrastructure for curiosity

330
00:16:42,129 --> 00:16:46,779
and creates a lot of damage so in this

331
00:16:44,319 --> 00:16:49,389
case let's suppose that we have our

332
00:16:46,779 --> 00:16:51,639
squirrel or any type of threat that is

333
00:16:49,389 --> 00:16:54,579
targeting our main power supply units

334
00:16:51,639 --> 00:16:58,110
that control the entire process that

335
00:16:54,579 --> 00:17:03,819
could cause a blackout in our cities so

336
00:16:58,110 --> 00:17:06,640
thankfully the power supply smart grid

337
00:17:03,819 --> 00:17:09,428
are hopefully more complex because their

338
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:11,199
different side pradhana see but this is

339
00:17:09,429 --> 00:17:14,409
just for passing the message that by

340
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:17,730
using active monitoring approach we can

341
00:17:14,409 --> 00:17:22,480
quit we can have a great knowledge

342
00:17:17,730 --> 00:17:24,490
details on specific failures on specific

343
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:26,980
units in our powers of up supply system

344
00:17:24,490 --> 00:17:28,630
and that sir is also related to the

345
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:30,790
second scenario where we are going to

346
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:35,080
target a redundancy system and

347
00:17:30,790 --> 00:17:39,100
a backup unit related to our ltu so

348
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:41,169
let's see the scenarios in action so for

349
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:44,139
what concern the redundancy system and

350
00:17:41,170 --> 00:17:47,500
backup unit related to our powers rates

351
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:49,540
to our ITU the indicator in which we are

352
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:52,000
going to focus is the last one power

353
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:55,870
supply and as you can see with just one

354
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:58,900
single value we can have the monitoring

355
00:17:55,870 --> 00:18:00,729
all the view of all the power supplies

356
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:02,500
that are related to our system so we

357
00:18:00,730 --> 00:18:05,830
have two for year two and one for the

358
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:08,740
hydro dam process so and as you can see

359
00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:12,010
as soon as our tractors is unplugging

360
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:14,170
the backup units we have an instant

361
00:18:12,010 --> 00:18:16,030
change in the relate indicator with

362
00:18:14,170 --> 00:18:18,520
indicator that now says that hey there's

363
00:18:16,030 --> 00:18:21,670
something wrong because your backup unit

364
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:23,920
is off and instantly you know a guardian

365
00:18:21,670 --> 00:18:27,160
appliance you will receive the operator

366
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:29,950
will see precise alert that says there's

367
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:32,800
an issue in a specific slot of your of

368
00:18:29,950 --> 00:18:35,050
your power supply system so you have to

369
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:36,669
do troubleshooting otherwise your

370
00:18:35,050 --> 00:18:39,850
readiness is not working anymore

371
00:18:36,670 --> 00:18:42,190
obviously so for what else in the

372
00:18:39,850 --> 00:18:44,949
process itself as you can see we have

373
00:18:42,190 --> 00:18:47,020
our process that is working properly we

374
00:18:44,950 --> 00:18:49,000
have also an insider I don't know if and

375
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:52,930
one of you were able to see it in one of

376
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:54,700
the tank and the indicator which we are

377
00:18:52,930 --> 00:18:57,400
going to focus is the ID rodent power

378
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:59,860
supply that's right now is powered on so

379
00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:03,580
everything is working fine but as soon

380
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:06,159
as our tracked actor is unplugging the

381
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:09,909
power supply we will have an instant

382
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:12,940
change that says that the I drew hydro

383
00:19:09,910 --> 00:19:16,000
dam power supply is turned off and we

384
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:18,370
will receive in our garden appliance an

385
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,800
instant alert that says to the operator

386
00:19:18,370 --> 00:19:22,389
a there's something wrong because right

387
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:29,200
now everything is stopped everything is

388
00:19:22,390 --> 00:19:31,120
shut down soon the last scenario we are

389
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:34,210
going to take in consideration what it

390
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:36,580
could happen if we have a trad actor

391
00:19:34,210 --> 00:19:39,100
that is targeting one of the device

392
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:43,129
inside our Skadden actor let's suppose

393
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:47,059
for example the HMI okay so we could

394
00:19:43,130 --> 00:19:49,700
attracted to the decide to target an HMI

395
00:19:47,059 --> 00:19:51,350
the vector attacks could be several who

396
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:54,230
have malware you could have an exploit

397
00:19:51,350 --> 00:19:56,059
that leads the possibility to gain a

398
00:19:54,230 --> 00:19:58,580
full control of device and has a

399
00:19:56,059 --> 00:20:00,590
consequence being able to 2p votes to

400
00:19:58,580 --> 00:20:03,379
the other device in the network so that

401
00:20:00,590 --> 00:20:05,120
the attacker will be able to have the

402
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:06,830
entire control of the network and has a

403
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:09,080
consequence obviously also in the

404
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:12,259
process let's see this scenario in

405
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:14,750
action so in this case we are going to

406
00:20:12,259 --> 00:20:17,330
focus our attention on all the tasks

407
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:19,519
that are running inside the device so as

408
00:20:17,330 --> 00:20:22,009
you can see we can monitor all the

409
00:20:19,519 --> 00:20:25,279
processes tasks that are run inside the

410
00:20:22,009 --> 00:20:27,889
HMI during the normal operation of our

411
00:20:25,279 --> 00:20:30,679
hydro dam and in this way we can create

412
00:20:27,889 --> 00:20:33,709
the sorts of a light list okay so a list

413
00:20:30,679 --> 00:20:37,820
of all the processes that I operate or I

414
00:20:33,710 --> 00:20:40,610
know that those processes are good to be

415
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:45,529
running during the entire execution of

416
00:20:40,610 --> 00:20:47,928
my eye to them okay in this way I can we

417
00:20:45,529 --> 00:20:50,480
can detect as soon as we have a new

418
00:20:47,929 --> 00:20:53,389
spawn of new processes that is outside

419
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:54,950
this white list so that we can reason

420
00:20:53,389 --> 00:20:56,479
alert and say hey there's something

421
00:20:54,950 --> 00:20:59,539
there's something strange that is

422
00:20:56,480 --> 00:21:02,590
working okay and as you can see here we

423
00:20:59,539 --> 00:21:06,830
have our attacker that is a that is a

424
00:21:02,590 --> 00:21:12,110
gained access to the operating system of

425
00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:14,928
the HMI and is starting to run execute a

426
00:21:12,110 --> 00:21:18,199
common in control okay common in control

427
00:21:14,929 --> 00:21:19,970
for gathering intelligence collects all

428
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:22,820
the information related to the network

429
00:21:19,970 --> 00:21:25,490
and being able to pivot his attack to

430
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:28,509
other devices other devices of interest

431
00:21:25,490 --> 00:21:31,970
and as you can see we have an instance

432
00:21:28,509 --> 00:21:33,799
instant alerts of two new processes that

433
00:21:31,970 --> 00:21:35,840
are blacklisted because there are

434
00:21:33,799 --> 00:21:39,168
outside of the whitelist that I said

435
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:42,860
before so this is the process that 90 is

436
00:21:39,169 --> 00:21:45,860
quite a bit common but normally you have

437
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:48,620
to inject you have to install an agent

438
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:50,240
inside the device I don't think that if

439
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:52,158
you go to an operator you will have a

440
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:55,370
you would like to install an edge it

441
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:56,900
your HMI or it on your ICS device I

442
00:21:55,370 --> 00:21:59,479
don't think it will be

443
00:21:56,900 --> 00:22:01,880
willing to do something like this but in

444
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:05,810
this way by using active monitoring

445
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:09,290
approach we can have these details and

446
00:22:05,810 --> 00:22:12,020
being able to achieve the same result

447
00:22:09,290 --> 00:22:14,770
without have to install anything inside

448
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:14,770
our device

449
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:24,440
thanks thanks Eunice so thank you to

450
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:26,780
everyone so what we saw today in the

451
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:31,730
presentation and what people like you to

452
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:33,649
remember and to let me say bringing home

453
00:22:31,730 --> 00:22:37,220
about the presentation of today are

454
00:22:33,650 --> 00:22:40,220
merely treaties so we show the beginning

455
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:43,070
standard a clear standard for smart grid

456
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:44,990
protection that is forcing and is

457
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:48,350
recommending also to the automation

458
00:22:44,990 --> 00:22:51,080
vendor to by design build equipment that

459
00:22:48,350 --> 00:22:53,480
provide health indicator about the

460
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:55,100
status of all the components that we

461
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:58,910
have in a smart grid or in a critical

462
00:22:55,100 --> 00:23:01,580
infrastructure so we saw some demo about

463
00:22:58,910 --> 00:23:03,620
potential attack and we show how it's

464
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:05,929
possible to detect that attack

465
00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:09,320
you know alessandro show some attack

466
00:23:05,930 --> 00:23:11,690
that was a physical attack we show a

467
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:14,240
potential attack to the logic inside the

468
00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:18,080
plc and the last one we show classical

469
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:20,420
attack basically attacking the HMI with

470
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:24,980
a monitoring of the of the different

471
00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:27,700
process so until today was possible to

472
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:30,290
identify this type of attack by a really

473
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:33,410
invasive technology inside the OT

474
00:23:30,290 --> 00:23:35,570
networks passive or technology that are

475
00:23:33,410 --> 00:23:38,120
really disruptive or dangerous to be

476
00:23:35,570 --> 00:23:39,830
used inside our network with the stander

477
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:42,679
and that is the second big takeaway

478
00:23:39,830 --> 00:23:46,129
point with the stander from the future

479
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:48,710
will be possible to by design monitor

480
00:23:46,130 --> 00:23:50,540
health status of our network and with

481
00:23:48,710 --> 00:23:52,070
the right solution these health status

482
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:55,550
can be correlated in order to identify

483
00:23:52,070 --> 00:23:57,919
potential attack in a safe way we're not

484
00:23:55,550 --> 00:24:00,169
saying let me show a tool a script that

485
00:23:57,920 --> 00:24:03,020
is pink in my plc devices and i don't

486
00:24:00,170 --> 00:24:05,690
know if my see plc devices will be still

487
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:08,600
alive after i di finish my active scan

488
00:24:05,690 --> 00:24:10,580
no no the stander is forced into up that

489
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:13,280
by design and to expose some in decay

490
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:14,810
and and the last things that we would

491
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:17,300
like you to bring home after this

492
00:24:14,810 --> 00:24:19,389
presentation is that we already have

493
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:21,919
some real application of that standard

494
00:24:19,390 --> 00:24:24,230
the majority of the automation vendor

495
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:25,910
are adopting the standard so in the

496
00:24:24,230 --> 00:24:29,420
future we will have depth you know we

497
00:24:25,910 --> 00:24:31,190
