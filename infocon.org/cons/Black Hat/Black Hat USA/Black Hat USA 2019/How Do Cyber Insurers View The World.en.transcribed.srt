all right good afternoon welcome to the

2
00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:08,849
final talk today in the cybersecurity

3
00:00:05,609 --> 00:00:12,300
Tsar the cyber insurance summit here in

11
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:32,488
have not already please put your phone

12

on silent and I will welcome to the

13
00:00:32,488 --> 00:00:37,849
stage Jeremiah Grossman who has been

14
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:40,320
taking us through the summit thank you

15
00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:42,090
alright welcome back everybody we're

16
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:45,059
gonna do our third and final cyber

17
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:46,379
insurance summit presentation and I'm

18
00:00:45,059 --> 00:00:48,360
really excited about this one we're very

19
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:51,120
fortunate to have an actual underwriter

20
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:54,210
and actual insurance carrier from a top

21
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:55,620
three cyber insurance firm he's gonna

22
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:57,270
explain to us how the sausage is made

23
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:59,099
from the other side you know do they

24
00:00:57,270 --> 00:01:01,649
plate claims how do they price risk in

25
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:03,149
all those sorts of things and one of the

26
00:01:01,649 --> 00:01:04,710
things he's invited us to do here is you

27
00:01:03,149 --> 00:01:05,909
have questions along the way for

28
00:01:04,709 --> 00:01:08,130
anything that he's presenting on or

29
00:01:05,909 --> 00:01:09,659
maybe even not you know raise your hand

30
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:11,339
and ask those questions as we go through

31
00:01:09,659 --> 00:01:12,990
the again we're all here to learn but

32
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:14,520
let me describe for you just you have

33
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:16,170
two things that you learned that we're

34
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:17,759
gonna learn from Matt and who he is so

35
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:19,650
he's a cyber insurance underwriter so he

36
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:21,780
helps write the policies he can write

37
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:25,950
policies for companies up to a hundred

38
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:27,840
million dollars a hundred million so he

39
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:29,670
has the actuarial data we can learn a

40
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:31,439
lot from them about InfoSec about what

41
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:33,329
what works and what doesn't work from up

42
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:34,470
from the data side so I'm not taking any

43
00:01:33,329 --> 00:01:36,210
more time or do they want to hear it yes

44
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:42,930
to say so please come on up man thank

45
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:45,720
you very much all right let me just read

46
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:47,670
a Twitter comment that was made on

47
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:48,170
Jeremiah's Twitter feed about an hour

48
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:51,509
ago

49
00:01:48,170 --> 00:01:53,549
okay so Jeremiah made a nice quote and

50
00:01:51,509 --> 00:01:55,590
this the only time I'll hold this the

51
00:01:53,549 --> 00:01:57,210
basically said he's excited after kind

52
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:59,610
of a long time of not having cyber

53
00:01:57,210 --> 00:02:02,100
insurance president blackhat we finally

54
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:03,840
have it so we've got a lot to learn some

55
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:06,179
of the comments or the first comment

56
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:07,860
within seconds was it's a shame that

57
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:10,110
another industry has to come in and

58
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:12,230
bigbrother us into doing a lot of things

59
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:14,840
we should have done ourselves

60
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:17,810
that's not what's happening I think it's

61
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:21,110
important as I'll go through cyber

62
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:22,700
insurance has been around since 1999 we

63
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:24,320
haven't had a significant presence at

64
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:27,679
things like blackhat and we should have

65
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:29,450
over the years so the incentives in what

66
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:32,150
I talk about I'm going to give you some

67
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:34,130
history of insurance just overall and I

68
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:35,480
know at blackhat there's not a ton of

69
00:02:34,130 --> 00:02:38,240
people who are too excited about

70
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:39,410
insurance but I also know that insurance

71
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,950
has taught us a lot of things through

72
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:41,780
history

73
00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:46,570
so just by show of hands who's into

74
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:50,540
history okay who's into military history

75
00:02:46,570 --> 00:02:53,769
okay who's into insurance history okay

76
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:57,019
and you can probably leave but again

77
00:02:53,770 --> 00:02:58,700
really where we're we're focused and on

78
00:02:57,020 --> 00:03:01,160
the title how do cyber insurers view the

79
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:03,470
world we're in the same world right I

80
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:05,420
know I'm wearing a suit I asked Jeremiah

81
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:09,500
closely should I just wear jeans and a

82
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:11,269
t-shirt and that's not my world but at

83
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:13,730
the more that our worlds interact the

84
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:16,340
more that we should be collaborating

85
00:03:13,730 --> 00:03:19,820
together so just as an example every day

86
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:22,070
we were one of 700 markets handle about

87
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:24,739
five cyber instance in a day and at

88
00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:27,079
least one ransom or claim every day why

89
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:28,400
that's important right you guys on the

90
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:30,590
front lines

91
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:32,720
you guys ultimately are associating

92
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:33,560
yourself with what's wrong we're dealing

93
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:35,150
with that every day

94
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:38,000
and so we've got a lot of data to share

95
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:40,310
we've made a lot of progress and we also

96
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:43,370
think that the data that cyber insurers

97
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:45,670
and the volume of cyber insurance is is

98
00:03:43,370 --> 00:03:49,580
at an exponential pace so market

99
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:51,739
estimation is about 4.2 billion of gross

100
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:54,470
written premium and I'm gonna explain

101
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:55,810
really the basics but I'm also gonna get

102
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:58,070
into a little bit more detail about

103
00:03:55,810 --> 00:03:59,870
what's on the horizon and then what

104
00:03:58,070 --> 00:04:01,459
specifically were focused on which I

105
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:03,860
think a help a lot of you a lot of you

106
00:04:01,459 --> 00:04:06,050
in the room the cyber insurance industry

107
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:08,900
also has a lot to learn right so

108
00:04:06,050 --> 00:04:10,670
attending black hats getting engaged

109
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:12,739
really having those conversations cross

110
00:04:10,670 --> 00:04:14,750
collaboration is what cyber insurance

111
00:04:12,739 --> 00:04:16,459
typically has not done our worlds

112
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:19,160
haven't collided and there's a couple

113
00:04:16,459 --> 00:04:20,750
reasons right we haven't interacted we

114
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:22,610
speak different languages we dress

115
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:25,400
differently and it's easy to make fun of

116
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:27,979
insurance so we're in that same

117
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:29,830
kind of cultural existence that a lot of

118
00:04:27,979 --> 00:04:33,949
customers have and a lot of you face

119
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:35,448
within your organization's so I thought

120
00:04:33,949 --> 00:04:38,330
I'd show you a picture of our

121
00:04:35,449 --> 00:04:40,490
underwriting lab right so we're back in

122
00:04:38,330 --> 00:04:42,710
the war this is what we do this is

123
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:45,560
insurance so this is actually a picture

124
00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:48,289
from the 1600s at Lloyds coffeehouse

125
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:51,110
where the underwriters would ultimately

126
00:04:48,290 --> 00:04:53,470
sign on to ships when they would make

127
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:55,880
their voyages across the ocean

128
00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:57,650
now the availability of data at the time

129
00:04:55,880 --> 00:05:00,710
would take almost six months to figure

130
00:04:57,650 --> 00:05:03,049
out whether or not you made money or you

131
00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:04,880
underwrote and took that risk on and

132
00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:06,979
with a lot of the unknowns at the time a

133
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:09,199
lot of these underwriters were literally

134
00:05:06,979 --> 00:05:11,300
just thinking and guessing of what would

135
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:12,740
what would occur what would happen based

136
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:15,500
on really things that they didn't have

137
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:19,160
much access to knowledge of or

138
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:20,539
intricacies into and again I know I'm

139
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:22,699
going back in time don't worry I'll get

140
00:05:20,539 --> 00:05:24,289
into cyber and cyber security controls

141
00:05:22,699 --> 00:05:26,840
and specifically what we're focused for

142
00:05:24,289 --> 00:05:28,840
but you got to understand with insurance

143
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:31,369
it's been around for over 300 years

144
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:33,770
cyber insurance has been around for 20

145
00:05:31,370 --> 00:05:35,750
we got to think about this in context of

146
00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:37,159
the bigger picture and almost the

147
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:40,220
longevity and the amount of coordination

148
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:42,349
that we need to have happen so this is

149
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:44,450
wealth of nations and I can assure you I

150
00:05:42,349 --> 00:05:46,190
get my guess as most of you didn't think

151
00:05:44,450 --> 00:05:48,680
that we'd be going back in a history

152
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:51,469
tour and quoting Adam Smith nor

153
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:54,020
something from 1776 would be applicable

154
00:05:51,470 --> 00:05:57,740
to cybersecurity or anything like this

155
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:59,840
at blackhat so ultimately we may learn

156
00:05:57,740 --> 00:06:01,610
from a very moderate profit of insurers

157
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:04,400
so there's a couple things there right

158
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:06,530
and I've highlighted it where most

159
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:10,130
people didn't know the price of marine

160
00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:11,929
insurance in the 16 1700s and then most

161
00:06:10,130 --> 00:06:14,360
actually didn't understand what the risk

162
00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:16,130
itself was right and I will get away

163
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:20,240
from being philosophical so don't worry

164
00:06:16,130 --> 00:06:22,250
here and and many ships again of all

165
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:24,740
seasons even in the time of war without

166
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:27,530
insurance would fail so why does this

167
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:31,520
become relevant so back in the 1600s

168
00:06:27,530 --> 00:06:33,729
1700s an underwriter knew if they made

169
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:36,650
money or didn't make money if ship

170
00:06:33,729 --> 00:06:40,930
disappeared crash etc

171
00:06:36,650 --> 00:06:43,520
and again Jake Jake pulled up a

172
00:06:40,930 --> 00:06:45,260
algorithm that wasn't very complicated a

173
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:47,240
lot of insurance and underwriting

174
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:50,780
process isn't complicated either right

175
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:53,780
premium losses premium and expense if

176
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:54,979
you outpace the losses your combined

177
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:57,880
ratio which is ultimately the

178
00:06:54,980 --> 00:07:00,890
profitability analysis of an insurer

179
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:02,390
less than a hundred percent is good more

180
00:07:00,890 --> 00:07:04,580
than 100 percent means you're losing

181
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:06,289
money on your insurance decisions and so

182
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:09,800
this goes back even to wealth of nations

183
00:07:06,290 --> 00:07:14,060
even to the 16 hundreds and and really

184
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:16,220
why it matters today okay underwriting

185
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:19,310
right so when it first started marine

186
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:21,170
insurance underwriting they understood

187
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:23,300
it the combined ratio concept wasn't

188
00:07:21,170 --> 00:07:23,810
that foreign and things were going

189
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:25,490
really well

190
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:27,740
underwriters are starting to learn which

191
00:07:25,490 --> 00:07:30,650
ships were good which voyages were safe

192
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:33,170
and then also when and faced with

193
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:35,299
certain situations why the protection

194
00:07:33,170 --> 00:07:38,780
matter so you can see the Union Jack

195
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:40,730
flying a lot of pirates understood that

196
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:42,260
that was actually protection and that

197
00:07:40,730 --> 00:07:44,840
was protection either in the form of

198
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:46,219
paying off the pirates and that

199
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:47,419
protection also was in the form of

200
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:52,550
making sure that those ships were

201
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:55,490
protected okay why that changed so in

202
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:57,680
the late 1770s the u.s. obviously won

203
00:07:55,490 --> 00:08:00,220
the Revolutionary War and they no longer

204
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:03,200
had protection and so this goes back to

205
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:05,300
the Tripoli pirates along the Barbary

206
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:07,580
Coast where a lot of ships would be

207
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:09,080
ransomed and they knew that the ships

208
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:12,140
didn't have protection because they

209
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:15,169
weren't supported by the Union Jack John

210
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:17,630
Adams ultimately went to London

211
00:08:15,170 --> 00:08:19,970
recognizing that the costs of insuring

212
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:22,070
ships was 20 times that that have

213
00:08:19,970 --> 00:08:24,020
previously had and some of the shipping

214
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:26,450
came to a stop okay

215
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:28,430
the also the other element to this too

216
00:08:26,450 --> 00:08:30,469
is that the ransoms were too much and

217
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:31,250
why this is obviously there's some

218
00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:34,190
connection here

219
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:36,200
right so when ransom goes up obviously

220
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:39,590
the ship the insurance of the ship

221
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:42,170
values also went up so that be without

222
00:08:39,590 --> 00:08:43,730
the support of the Union Jack a lot of

223
00:08:42,169 --> 00:08:46,219
these insurers ultimately said look this

224
00:08:43,730 --> 00:08:49,490
risk is too much for us and and

225
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:50,529
basically increase the price this all

226
00:08:49,490 --> 00:08:52,749
comes together

227
00:08:50,529 --> 00:08:55,449
again so things that we've learned in

228
00:08:52,749 --> 00:08:58,300
insurance write protection is good no

229
00:08:55,449 --> 00:09:01,060
protection is bad pretty simple fire

230
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:04,290
insurance same analogy same analogy

231
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:07,569
different century so in the 1800's

232
00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:09,759
Industry Classification started and what

233
00:09:07,569 --> 00:09:12,910
underwriters realized was that the most

234
00:09:09,759 --> 00:09:15,069
insecure industry from fire was paper

235
00:09:12,910 --> 00:09:17,199
mills which is about as obvious as it

236
00:09:15,069 --> 00:09:18,878
gets right so the insurance industry

237
00:09:17,199 --> 00:09:21,998
started to adjust pricing based on paper

238
00:09:18,879 --> 00:09:24,550
mills and they then kind of got back to

239
00:09:21,999 --> 00:09:27,430
that combined ratio concept the other

240
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:29,620
the other aspect of this is mistakes

241
00:09:27,430 --> 00:09:31,599
were made right good decisions were made

242
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:33,399
bad decisions were made underwriters

243
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:37,600
that weren't paying attention ultimately

244
00:09:33,399 --> 00:09:39,279
were out of business this seal and so if

245
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:41,769
you drive around on the East Coast

246
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:44,259
typically in Boston London Philadelphia

247
00:09:41,769 --> 00:09:47,649
these fire marks existed to identify

248
00:09:44,259 --> 00:09:49,749
which insure insured said buildings and

249
00:09:47,649 --> 00:09:52,029
so this is the stamp almost of approval

250
00:09:49,749 --> 00:09:53,439
from an insurer but it was also the way

251
00:09:52,029 --> 00:09:55,240
in which the fire departments could

252
00:09:53,439 --> 00:09:56,649
track down and at the time they weren't

253
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:58,930
fire departments it was ultimately a

254
00:09:56,649 --> 00:10:00,399
horse and carriage and decide whether or

255
00:09:58,930 --> 00:10:04,649
not to put the fire out based on who the

256
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:07,569
insurance insurance carrier work okay

257
00:10:04,649 --> 00:10:10,029
cooperations so when the chicago fire

258
00:10:07,569 --> 00:10:12,639
happened when the new york fire happened

259
00:10:10,029 --> 00:10:15,040
the insurance carriers at the time

260
00:10:12,639 --> 00:10:17,829
realized hey this is problematic right

261
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:19,329
we can't sustain this and we actually

262
00:10:17,829 --> 00:10:21,508
have to find better ways to coordinate

263
00:10:19,329 --> 00:10:24,430
and collaborate with those that protect

264
00:10:21,509 --> 00:10:30,309
the buildings and the ships that we

265
00:10:24,430 --> 00:10:31,870
insure the other the last insurance

266
00:10:30,309 --> 00:10:35,079
history analogy on many years so just

267
00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:38,379
bear with me here property insurance so

268
00:10:35,079 --> 00:10:40,378
in today's dollars the market in in last

269
00:10:38,379 --> 00:10:42,759
century was only forty million dollars

270
00:10:40,379 --> 00:10:46,269
right cyber insurance market today is

271
00:10:42,759 --> 00:10:48,910
worth four billion the lost driver last

272
00:10:46,269 --> 00:10:51,839
century was fire the other perils that

273
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:54,910
were insured were quake the cap the

274
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:56,949
catastrophic exposure was it excluded

275
00:10:54,910 --> 00:10:59,199
was it controlled some would say yes

276
00:10:56,949 --> 00:11:00,870
some would say no but it was controlled

277
00:10:59,199 --> 00:11:03,000
based on what was learned through

278
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:07,260
the Chicago and New York fires at the

279
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:09,450
time the geography San Francisco was it

280
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:12,750
was of concern and the aggregation that

281
00:11:09,450 --> 00:11:14,790
existed specific to San Francisco was of

282
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:18,750
topic and of concern to the underwriting

283
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:21,300
community what what happened was

284
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:23,700
obviously the San Francisco fire 100,000

285
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:26,130
policyholders impacted almost 4 billion

286
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:29,220
of loss the number of insurance carriers

287
00:11:26,130 --> 00:11:31,370
that went in solve it were over 14 the

288
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:34,160
percent of insured losses paid 76

289
00:11:31,370 --> 00:11:36,720
percent which is not a good statistic

290
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:39,600
and then the prior year's profits earase

291
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:43,440
was 47 years so how does cyber fit in

292
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:45,780
right so cyber historically again goes

293
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:48,690
back to 1999 approximately some would

294
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:50,520
say 97 96 before that back in the day

295
00:11:48,690 --> 00:11:52,890
where we would literally explain what

296
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:55,500
cyber extortion meant and make up claims

297
00:11:52,890 --> 00:11:59,730
right fast forward today and it's every

298
00:11:55,500 --> 00:12:01,830
day other perils business interruptions

299
00:11:59,730 --> 00:12:05,970
cyber extortion the ransoms themselves

300
00:12:01,830 --> 00:12:07,380
cat perils excluded or control yes to

301
00:12:05,970 --> 00:12:10,260
some degree I'm gonna give a little bit

302
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:12,510
color as to what catastrophic scenarios

303
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:14,370
were focused on and what catastrophic

304
00:12:12,510 --> 00:12:17,189
scenarios the industry itself is focused

305
00:12:14,370 --> 00:12:19,170
on and then cat events have they

306
00:12:17,190 --> 00:12:21,750
happened someone say yes someone said no

307
00:12:19,170 --> 00:12:24,599
not petty is obviously wake up call

308
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:26,490
wanna cry was the signal not petty it

309
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:31,710
was a wake-up call for across the entire

310
00:12:26,490 --> 00:12:34,620
industry as to the geography that also

311
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:37,920
represented a clear global issue that

312
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:40,290
was specific to a specific geography

313
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:43,229
that prior to that the cyber insurance

314
00:12:40,290 --> 00:12:46,349
industry didn't really recognize or

315
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:48,600
respect okay

316
00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:50,690
so cyber insurance is too new to have

317
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:54,620
data and this is a this is a real myth

318
00:12:50,690 --> 00:12:58,410
okay so some there's over 700 insurers

319
00:12:54,620 --> 00:13:00,750
about 400 in the United States some have

320
00:12:58,410 --> 00:13:03,000
lost ratios that are 0% which mean they

321
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:05,550
have paid no claims or seen no claims

322
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:08,070
some have lost ratios that are in excess

323
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:10,050
of 400 percent so that means for every

324
00:13:08,070 --> 00:13:12,480
dollar they wrote they paid out four

325
00:13:10,050 --> 00:13:13,269
dollars not necessarily a sign of a good

326
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:16,089
underwriter

327
00:13:13,269 --> 00:13:18,369
it's pretty basic right it's look if I

328
00:13:16,089 --> 00:13:20,860
understand my expenses if I understand

329
00:13:18,369 --> 00:13:23,350
the risk I'm taking my combined ratio

330
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:25,660
should not exceed 100% and that's a key

331
00:13:23,350 --> 00:13:28,709
tenant of what underwriters do cyber

332
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:31,959
insurance underwriters are no different

333
00:13:28,709 --> 00:13:35,170
okay so not pettier and again I'm happy

334
00:13:31,959 --> 00:13:36,670
to answer questions as they come a lot

335
00:13:35,170 --> 00:13:38,819
of these companies did not have

336
00:13:36,670 --> 00:13:40,889
insurance a lot of these companies

337
00:13:38,819 --> 00:13:44,949
specifically do not have cyber insurance

338
00:13:40,889 --> 00:13:46,179
a lot of kind of commentary and some

339
00:13:44,949 --> 00:13:49,300
questions that the prior speakers

340
00:13:46,179 --> 00:13:51,189
received we're really focused around you

341
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:53,290
know I'm reading the headlines does

342
00:13:51,189 --> 00:13:55,209
cyber insurance pay and it's really

343
00:13:53,290 --> 00:14:00,730
important to think about cyber insurance

344
00:13:55,209 --> 00:14:02,979
as a specific trigger that is

345
00:14:00,730 --> 00:14:05,230
specifically covered whereas a lot of

346
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:07,569
the the the media picks up on property

347
00:14:05,230 --> 00:14:09,160
insurance where the decision-maker and

348
00:14:07,569 --> 00:14:11,889
the insurance decision makers did not

349
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:14,589
actually by a cyber insurance policy but

350
00:14:11,889 --> 00:14:16,420
you can see share of 2.2 billion loss

351
00:14:14,589 --> 00:14:18,610
since then obviously I think most

352
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:20,799
estimates would would increase that to

353
00:14:18,610 --> 00:14:23,199
over ten billion but in a four billion

354
00:14:20,799 --> 00:14:25,929
dollar cyber insurance industry that

355
00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:28,449
also results in a pretty significant

356
00:14:25,929 --> 00:14:29,740
combined ratio where the profits of the

357
00:14:28,449 --> 00:14:32,609
years would have been erased very

358
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:35,319
quickly and especially given a ukrainian

359
00:14:32,610 --> 00:14:38,049
accounting software that is actually

360
00:14:35,319 --> 00:14:39,910
absent and distinct from what most would

361
00:14:38,049 --> 00:14:41,980
consider the catastrophic systemic event

362
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:43,809
that we face so why all this is

363
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:45,610
important right and I'm gonna talk a lot

364
00:14:43,809 --> 00:14:47,860
about you know the underwriting process

365
00:14:45,610 --> 00:14:49,929
how we see companies why we look at

366
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:51,160
companies how we price this some of the

367
00:14:49,929 --> 00:14:54,369
different questions that we can and

368
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:57,249
cannot ask but really cyber insurance

369
00:14:54,369 --> 00:14:59,949
doesn't pay claims and Jake Jake talk a

370
00:14:57,249 --> 00:15:01,869
little a little bit about this is the

371
00:14:59,949 --> 00:15:03,878
cyber insurance as my cybersecurity tool

372
00:15:01,869 --> 00:15:05,379
didn't work so none do right and that's

373
00:15:03,879 --> 00:15:08,799
not necessarily a philosophy that we

374
00:15:05,379 --> 00:15:10,959
hold at all so you know cyber insurance

375
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:12,759
obviously has different offshoots number

376
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:14,170
of different carriers different

377
00:15:12,759 --> 00:15:16,089
strategies different structures

378
00:15:14,170 --> 00:15:18,219
different coverage some wouldn't even

379
00:15:16,089 --> 00:15:20,049
refer to cyber insurance as other

380
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:22,329
insurance right so crime insurance

381
00:15:20,049 --> 00:15:24,209
exists kidnapping extortion experience

382
00:15:22,329 --> 00:15:26,520
exists property insurance exists

383
00:15:24,209 --> 00:15:28,290
casualty insurance exists DNA

384
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:30,510
insurance coverage exists cyber

385
00:15:28,290 --> 00:15:33,510
insurance is very specific and

386
00:15:30,510 --> 00:15:35,819
structured to cyber risks now you might

387
00:15:33,510 --> 00:15:38,069
also think as a as a practitioner or a

388
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:39,630
secured professional that's great all i

389
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:41,700
care about insurance is that it pays

390
00:15:39,630 --> 00:15:44,730
which in some ways I agree with you

391
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:46,920
so how cyber risk interacts with

392
00:15:44,730 --> 00:15:50,430
everything that we do again i sat in on

393
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:52,110
an IOT attack scenario and actually

394
00:15:50,430 --> 00:15:54,900
where things can become physical and

395
00:15:52,110 --> 00:15:58,050
we've seen a lot of malicious malicious

396
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:59,880
or damaged focus ransomware that's also

397
00:15:58,050 --> 00:16:02,069
impacting other lines of insurance which

398
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:03,930
is important to understand so it's

399
00:16:02,070 --> 00:16:05,670
important right so the last thing I

400
00:16:03,930 --> 00:16:09,420
would ever say is look security tools

401
00:16:05,670 --> 00:16:10,650
don't work some don't some do and that's

402
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:12,060
really where we have to kind of come

403
00:16:10,650 --> 00:16:13,590
together and figure this out

404
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:14,939
and so I'll get into a little bit of

405
00:16:13,590 --> 00:16:15,560
detail as to how I think that's gonna

406
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:19,260
happen

407
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:21,109
the other thing and I am gonna again

408
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:23,610
this is the only kind of Chubb focused

409
00:16:21,110 --> 00:16:25,740
section but being transparent with our

410
00:16:23,610 --> 00:16:27,420
claims as an industry it's something

411
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:30,120
that's happened in fire insurance and

412
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:33,089
and hull insurance for over a hundred

413
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:34,950
years we have to basically share more

414
00:16:33,090 --> 00:16:37,710
with the communities that can actually

415
00:16:34,950 --> 00:16:39,690
use this data so we we put out about a

416
00:16:37,710 --> 00:16:42,180
year and a half ago on the Chubb cyber

417
00:16:39,690 --> 00:16:44,280
index which index is over ten years of

418
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:46,739
our claims data and the volume of this

419
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:48,150
is obviously exponentially increasing so

420
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:51,120
how we structure it is in the varus

421
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:54,630
framework ask that actor action industry

422
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:56,760
size etc and these are real this isn't a

423
00:16:54,630 --> 00:16:59,280
study this isn't an app this isn't an

424
00:16:56,760 --> 00:17:01,530
estimate this is real claims we also

425
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:02,550
have access to real claims dollars so

426
00:17:01,530 --> 00:17:05,399
that people can start to make decisions

427
00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:08,849
based on specifically which tools in

428
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:11,640
which products that they're thinking of

429
00:17:08,849 --> 00:17:13,980
using using or maybe should or should

430
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:16,560
not have used now why this is really

431
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:18,510
important right so setting a trend and

432
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:20,429
being first is important we're now

433
00:17:18,510 --> 00:17:22,470
getting most of the cyber insurance

434
00:17:20,430 --> 00:17:23,700
industry understanding of this but we're

435
00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:26,040
also educating the cyber insurance

436
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:27,959
industry and the brokers to start to

437
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:30,420
speak a little bit more like this

438
00:17:27,959 --> 00:17:32,310
audience right start to understand the

439
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:34,770
acronyms start to be able to get into a

440
00:17:32,310 --> 00:17:36,659
client and explain what they need to do

441
00:17:34,770 --> 00:17:39,540
and we've even seen some acquisitions

442
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:40,410
from large sophisticated brokers in the

443
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:42,240
cyber security

444
00:17:40,410 --> 00:17:45,180
face itself and that's important right

445
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:47,100
so as these worlds collide again this is

446
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:49,410
a Big Brother this is basically making

447
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:51,510
sure that as the cybersecurity world

448
00:17:49,410 --> 00:17:53,490
grows as the cyber insurance world grows

449
00:17:51,510 --> 00:17:56,100
that we actually grow both in the right

450
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:57,870
form and fashion so you know no one

451
00:17:56,100 --> 00:18:00,389
likes bad products right we can all

452
00:17:57,870 --> 00:18:03,389
badmouth a bad product but we could also

453
00:18:00,390 --> 00:18:05,610
really kind of respect and start to show

454
00:18:03,390 --> 00:18:08,310
some form of efficacy of the good

455
00:18:05,610 --> 00:18:11,219
products and that's something that we do

456
00:18:08,310 --> 00:18:12,990
think will come together as both worlds

457
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:15,300
collide I do think in some ways cyber

458
00:18:12,990 --> 00:18:17,100
insurance was late so we actually

459
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:19,260
preceded blackhat but unfortunately we

460
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:22,110
haven't had much of a presence over the

461
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:24,360
last few years okay

462
00:18:22,110 --> 00:18:25,620
so what's in our heads right and I've

463
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:27,360
had a lot of conversations throughout

464
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:29,669
the last day and a half what are we

465
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:30,719
thinking right and in some ways I think

466
00:18:29,670 --> 00:18:32,700
a lot of you would think I'm actually

467
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:34,950
going down a ladder to come into your

468
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:37,170
head rather than up a ladder so don't

469
00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:40,050
take any connotation within the within

470
00:18:37,170 --> 00:18:42,360
the slide but we're thinking a lot right

471
00:18:40,050 --> 00:18:45,360
we are dealing with these claims every

472
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:46,830
day and we also have exposure that is

473
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:50,100
existing and changing every day

474
00:18:46,830 --> 00:18:52,860
and put a quote from Alex Stamos and I

475
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:54,719
apologize if I'm mispronouncing but

476
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:56,070
ultimately the struggles that you have

477
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:58,530
every day are also actually

478
00:18:56,070 --> 00:19:00,419
exponentially our struggles so when I go

479
00:18:58,530 --> 00:19:03,379
meet with the client again I've arranged

480
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:06,210
from clients anywhere from fortune ten

481
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:08,640
where I'm in intimate with the sea the

482
00:19:06,210 --> 00:19:10,950
sea so we've spent two and a half days

483
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:13,040
with some clients we've actually had a

484
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:14,760
lot of time and effort spent

485
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:17,040
understanding specifically where

486
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:19,410
investments and spends are with large

487
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:21,360
CISOs but the reality is is we also have

488
00:19:19,410 --> 00:19:23,670
a lot of customers that ultimately have

489
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:25,260
no idea what blackhat is right they

490
00:19:23,670 --> 00:19:27,810
don't understand what's happening they

491
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:29,879
need help they may have the worst cyber

492
00:19:27,810 --> 00:19:31,770
circuit controls there are how do you

493
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:33,780
scale that and how do you react to that

494
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:36,600
and that's a struggle that I have as a

495
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:39,780
risk bear right how do we how do we

496
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:41,520
ultimately sit here and say look we can

497
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:44,610
understand our exposures but when the

498
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:47,639
seaso really has no I'll say formal

499
00:19:44,610 --> 00:19:51,000
rules around certain things what can we

500
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:52,590
do to actually improve risk overall when

501
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,240
we don't have much visibility into that

502
00:19:52,590 --> 00:19:56,330
environment

503
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:58,820
and so I think where we go is obviously

504
00:19:56,330 --> 00:20:00,918
getting a lot more visibility but I also

505
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:04,580
want to kind of give you a sense of how

506
00:20:00,919 --> 00:20:07,309
big this market is if this market was me

507
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:08,480
obviously the intimacy and level of

508
00:20:07,309 --> 00:20:10,340
interaction that I have with customers

509
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:12,649
is not right

510
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:14,000
four billion market I have no idea

511
00:20:12,649 --> 00:20:17,840
what's going on that's not the case

512
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:20,090
right so really just understanding the

513
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:22,459
insurance I'll refer to it as the cyber

514
00:20:20,090 --> 00:20:25,760
insurance supply chain is very similar

515
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:28,010
to VARs it's very similar to security

516
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:28,970
buying habits we do typically interact

517
00:20:28,010 --> 00:20:31,220
with different people within

518
00:20:28,970 --> 00:20:33,200
organizations so when I go meet with a

519
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:35,480
large accountant or enterprise customer

520
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:37,370
I'm meeting the C cell I'm meeting the

521
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:40,940
risk manager meeting the general counsel

522
00:20:37,370 --> 00:20:43,250
at times the CFO if I'm lucky we'll get

523
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:47,870
some element of a CIO we'll get some

524
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:50,480
element of again maybe the the Human

525
00:20:47,870 --> 00:20:51,860
Resources but oftentimes it's kind of

526
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:53,750
the group that's coming together for a

527
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:55,789
reinsurance underwriting meeting so what

528
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:58,490
I'll kind of get into is the insurance

529
00:20:55,789 --> 00:21:00,200
buyer and the almost the lack of

530
00:20:58,490 --> 00:21:02,090
coordination at an insurance buyer

531
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:05,990
perspective also exacerbates some of our

532
00:21:02,090 --> 00:21:07,459
issues so when when you look at security

533
00:21:05,990 --> 00:21:10,190
tools and security products and the

534
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:11,720
reason I refer to it as a var is you

535
00:21:10,190 --> 00:21:13,880
also have kind of the enterprise style

536
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:15,260
within cybersecurity right I wanted to

537
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:17,120
work directly with the customer and

538
00:21:15,260 --> 00:21:20,210
understand a lot of what's going on so

539
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:22,158
that my tool is perceived as good what I

540
00:21:20,210 --> 00:21:24,350
don't need is someone to broadly

541
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:26,179
distribute something and then basically

542
00:21:24,350 --> 00:21:28,490
I'm lost in the shuffle with all the

543
00:21:26,179 --> 00:21:32,330
other tools and products so you have the

544
00:21:28,490 --> 00:21:34,309
insurance buyer you have a broker and

545
00:21:32,330 --> 00:21:36,889
Jeff actually stopped talked a little

546
00:21:34,309 --> 00:21:38,928
bit about insurance 101 who's also has

547
00:21:36,890 --> 00:21:39,950
it has some element of knowledge around

548
00:21:38,929 --> 00:21:43,130
cybersecurity

549
00:21:39,950 --> 00:21:45,520
a lot of the good ones actually can I'll

550
00:21:43,130 --> 00:21:48,730
say go toe to toe with some of the CISOs

551
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:52,010
you have the insurer we then have a

552
00:21:48,730 --> 00:21:53,390
concept that's a reinsurance broker so

553
00:21:52,010 --> 00:21:55,070
you have a lot of different reinsurance

554
00:21:53,390 --> 00:21:58,220
carriers who have kind of different

555
00:21:55,070 --> 00:22:00,590
styles of cyber insurance knowledge and

556
00:21:58,220 --> 00:22:03,559
then you have the reinsurance brokers

557
00:22:00,590 --> 00:22:05,480
who also then broker what is referred to

558
00:22:03,559 --> 00:22:07,820
as retro session or ILS coverage

559
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:15,440
so in the property world a lot of these

560
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:17,899
are I'll say are almost stabilized right

561
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:20,480
it's a mature market a lot of the folks

562
00:22:17,899 --> 00:22:22,309
they understand property insurance or

563
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:24,679
they understand whatever insurance is

564
00:22:22,309 --> 00:22:27,350
going up this value chain with cyber

565
00:22:24,679 --> 00:22:29,929
insurance it is new right with only 20

566
00:22:27,350 --> 00:22:31,879
years in in the books there's an element

567
00:22:29,929 --> 00:22:33,260
where it's a learning curve but because

568
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:35,360
of what's changing and evolving within

569
00:22:33,260 --> 00:22:38,210
the cyber security space it's a learning

570
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:39,709
curve that has an exponential impact so

571
00:22:38,210 --> 00:22:42,380
it's pretty complicated when you get

572
00:22:39,710 --> 00:22:44,899
into can't this be easier right and with

573
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:46,909
700 markets you know the intensity level

574
00:22:44,899 --> 00:22:49,399
Jake mentioned we want to be able to

575
00:22:46,909 --> 00:22:51,590
raise the bar from a controls

576
00:22:49,399 --> 00:22:54,229
perspective I'd say we as an industry

577
00:22:51,590 --> 00:22:56,360
think that we're doing that already and

578
00:22:54,230 --> 00:22:58,870
I'll kind of get into how we do that and

579
00:22:56,360 --> 00:23:01,789
then I'm open to questions throughout so

580
00:22:58,870 --> 00:23:04,789
feel free to chime in or disagree or

581
00:23:01,789 --> 00:23:07,850
agree so and I'm gonna range anywhere

582
00:23:04,789 --> 00:23:10,070
from fortune ten interactions all the

583
00:23:07,850 --> 00:23:12,889
way to small business where there's no

584
00:23:10,070 --> 00:23:15,740
questions asked right so typically what

585
00:23:12,889 --> 00:23:18,260
will happen and again as a buyer you may

586
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:20,330
or may not have any interest in this or

587
00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:21,950
as a security practitioner security

588
00:23:20,330 --> 00:23:23,720
professional we may have zero interest

589
00:23:21,950 --> 00:23:26,690
and say look let's get to what you're

590
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:28,909
focused on but a lot of the challenge of

591
00:23:26,690 --> 00:23:31,370
cyber insurance at a large customer is

592
00:23:28,909 --> 00:23:33,710
bringing the team together so my first

593
00:23:31,370 --> 00:23:34,820
signal when I walk into a meeting and

594
00:23:33,710 --> 00:23:36,679
when you have the risk management team

595
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:38,539
when you have the seaso and they've

596
00:23:36,679 --> 00:23:39,950
never met I know right away that there's

597
00:23:38,539 --> 00:23:42,799
at least some form of lack of

598
00:23:39,950 --> 00:23:45,139
communication now then you also have

599
00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:46,549
some customers who literally you can

600
00:23:45,139 --> 00:23:48,439
tell they've gone through things before

601
00:23:46,549 --> 00:23:50,570
that's also could be perceived as a

602
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:52,940
negative but a lot of these different

603
00:23:50,570 --> 00:23:55,460
observations and experiences they tend

604
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:57,740
to be cultural and then we also focus on

605
00:23:55,460 --> 00:24:01,159
structure of the organization along with

606
00:23:57,740 --> 00:24:04,010
spend so if we can kind of determine and

607
00:24:01,159 --> 00:24:06,169
I'm just broadly setting an expectation

608
00:24:04,010 --> 00:24:08,720
where the cybersecurity spend is less

609
00:24:06,169 --> 00:24:10,370
than nine percent or as an example if

610
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:12,080
the financial institution industry and

611
00:24:10,370 --> 00:24:14,330
the security spend is 6 percent 7

612
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:16,189
percent I automatically know there's at

613
00:24:14,330 --> 00:24:18,220
least some form of imbalance and my goal

614
00:24:16,190 --> 00:24:20,230
is to find out why right

615
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:21,909
that's a kind of an easy convo I should

616
00:24:20,230 --> 00:24:23,230
say that's somewhat of a concept that

617
00:24:21,909 --> 00:24:26,650
has an underwriter you kind of learn

618
00:24:23,230 --> 00:24:29,080
over time you then have kind of just

619
00:24:26,650 --> 00:24:32,080
knowing what a company does and so that

620
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:34,270
seems very basic but really a lot of

621
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:36,760
these underwriting meetings are focused

622
00:24:34,270 --> 00:24:38,500
on look what do you do and I might

623
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:41,490
actually be able to explain to you where

624
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:43,750
your cyber risk is now there's obviously

625
00:24:41,490 --> 00:24:46,150
kind of the consulting industry that can

626
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:48,010
also do similar things and they do it

627
00:24:46,150 --> 00:24:49,720
well but they're also not looking at it

628
00:24:48,010 --> 00:24:51,400
from an insurance recovery standpoint so

629
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:53,919
a lot of our interactions with customers

630
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:55,750
is on that very basis right what do you

631
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:57,280
do and what are the bad things that

632
00:24:55,750 --> 00:24:59,919
could happen as a result of that

633
00:24:57,280 --> 00:25:03,129
especially in a you know not just data

634
00:24:59,919 --> 00:25:05,140
breach but just as a system interruption

635
00:25:03,130 --> 00:25:07,809
you know something similar to not petia

636
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:10,440
is how bad could things be and so that's

637
00:25:07,809 --> 00:25:14,710
a really key part of the underwriting

638
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:16,270
methodology security and we're gonna get

639
00:25:14,710 --> 00:25:19,299
into more detail on security and privacy

640
00:25:16,270 --> 00:25:21,340
just as an example and again the

641
00:25:19,299 --> 00:25:24,879
established markets you know you can

642
00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:27,250
range anywhere from and I'm gonna 347

643
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:29,710
different factors on an individual risk

644
00:25:27,250 --> 00:25:32,530
regardless of size that an underwriter

645
00:25:29,710 --> 00:25:35,409
could basically say this is good this is

646
00:25:32,530 --> 00:25:37,090
bad and I used 347 because that's part

647
00:25:35,409 --> 00:25:39,010
of the filing process so we actually

648
00:25:37,090 --> 00:25:41,408
have to evidence and this is a

649
00:25:39,010 --> 00:25:43,090
us-centric comment we have to evidence

650
00:25:41,409 --> 00:25:45,159
why we're asking certain questions and

651
00:25:43,090 --> 00:25:46,510
then the perceived risk reduction that

652
00:25:45,159 --> 00:25:49,720
we think and that's a challenge for

653
00:25:46,510 --> 00:25:51,309
cyber insurance but what we what we do

654
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:54,280
expect is an underwriter to go through

655
00:25:51,309 --> 00:25:55,750
that methodology in that process now if

656
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:57,700
that underwriter is a human that

657
00:25:55,750 --> 00:25:59,620
obviously is time consuming if that

658
00:25:57,700 --> 00:26:02,200
underwriter is dealing with a small risk

659
00:25:59,620 --> 00:26:04,120
or SME then that out that underwriting

660
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:06,429
intensity obviously goes with the other

661
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:08,439
500 markets that are that are looking at

662
00:26:06,429 --> 00:26:10,360
that same risk if that underwriting

663
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:12,220
intensity is at the you know again I

664
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:14,080
think referenced the up to 100 million

665
00:26:12,220 --> 00:26:15,880
dollars in limit then we're spending

666
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:18,149
days going through this and making sure

667
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:21,250
that we're making the right decisions

668
00:26:18,150 --> 00:26:23,230
some of the basics right governance you

669
00:26:21,250 --> 00:26:25,570
know technology team governance

670
00:26:23,230 --> 00:26:28,840
technology team spend the staff

671
00:26:25,570 --> 00:26:31,000
themselves so most customers again large

672
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:32,799
enterprise customers we will

673
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:34,840
get backgrounds of a lot of the folks on

674
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:37,030
the team but we'll also look at where

675
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:40,360
they're spending money on specifically

676
00:26:37,030 --> 00:26:42,158
where we think they need to be and I'll

677
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:43,928
get into a little bit of that but you

678
00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:45,820
know we're seeing obviously identity

679
00:26:43,929 --> 00:26:47,110
access management I can can't tell you

680
00:26:45,820 --> 00:26:49,960
the number of customers where I've gone

681
00:26:47,110 --> 00:26:52,000
to where we ask them where you focus in

682
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:55,299
your spend that typically is this year's

683
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:57,909
answer and and then the question of why

684
00:26:55,299 --> 00:26:59,860
or where or how comes with it as a

685
00:26:57,909 --> 00:27:01,750
result and then really learning from

686
00:26:59,860 --> 00:27:02,770
that can also help us influence the

687
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:04,659
smaller customers

688
00:27:02,770 --> 00:27:07,179
so those customers that ultimately may

689
00:27:04,659 --> 00:27:09,700
not have a/c so they may not even have a

690
00:27:07,179 --> 00:27:11,559
security team we actually can start to

691
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:12,909
add value by saying look here's what

692
00:27:11,559 --> 00:27:15,580
we're seeing here's what we're focused

693
00:27:12,909 --> 00:27:18,309
on and you know the last thing I would

694
00:27:15,580 --> 00:27:21,010
say is we don't need to tell a large

695
00:27:18,309 --> 00:27:22,809
fortune 500 CE so they user awareness

696
00:27:21,010 --> 00:27:25,150
training is a good thing right

697
00:27:22,809 --> 00:27:27,940
if that's our only question or our only

698
00:27:25,150 --> 00:27:30,220
kind of value that we add back it's no

699
00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:33,070
value right we really are starting to

700
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:35,260
educate even those fortune 500 CEOs on

701
00:27:33,070 --> 00:27:38,340
things that we've experienced or things

702
00:27:35,260 --> 00:27:41,470
that we've seen and not replacing threat

703
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:44,080
Intel but just explaining ok this is

704
00:27:41,470 --> 00:27:45,340
something that's occurred and really

705
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:49,139
where does your risk management team

706
00:27:45,340 --> 00:27:51,639
want this from a risk tolerance level

707
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:53,860
let me start with claims activity so

708
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:55,960
just general observations the company

709
00:27:53,860 --> 00:27:58,689
that's gone through a data incident is a

710
00:27:55,960 --> 00:28:00,340
better company as a result now there's

711
00:27:58,690 --> 00:28:01,960
some elements there where obviously

712
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:03,789
there's caveats right they've gone

713
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:05,650
through a ransomware event and they

714
00:28:03,789 --> 00:28:08,559
ended up paying it made the decision to

715
00:28:05,650 --> 00:28:12,429
pay there's some concerns right so the

716
00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:14,950
various especially as it relates to the

717
00:28:12,429 --> 00:28:17,169
compromise or the indicator wherever it

718
00:28:14,950 --> 00:28:19,539
happened there's things that you can fix

719
00:28:17,169 --> 00:28:21,460
but the reality is is most of the time a

720
00:28:19,539 --> 00:28:23,110
company that's gone through this is

721
00:28:21,460 --> 00:28:25,409
actually a better risk because the

722
00:28:23,110 --> 00:28:28,090
company broadly has gone through this

723
00:28:25,409 --> 00:28:29,950
and again the experience that we bring

724
00:28:28,090 --> 00:28:32,408
is a lot of that is explaining why

725
00:28:29,950 --> 00:28:34,570
that's important so that it's very

726
00:28:32,409 --> 00:28:36,880
obvious it's that's because your

727
00:28:34,570 --> 00:28:38,710
experience on this event and you've had

728
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:40,210
the chance to make sure that the urgency

729
00:28:38,710 --> 00:28:43,930
is important and the decisions are pre

730
00:28:40,210 --> 00:28:48,850
vetted the security presentation and I

731
00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:51,610
I do think it's really important as the

732
00:28:48,850 --> 00:28:53,709
cyber insurance market as we collaborate

733
00:28:51,610 --> 00:28:56,350
more right so that it collaborating more

734
00:28:53,710 --> 00:28:58,780
is an absolute must with this community

735
00:28:56,350 --> 00:29:02,290
but we'll focus everywhere from vision

736
00:28:58,780 --> 00:29:03,910
right that's an easy one hi Cecil

737
00:29:02,290 --> 00:29:06,490
can you give me a sense of where you see

738
00:29:03,910 --> 00:29:08,590
this where your company sees this where

739
00:29:06,490 --> 00:29:11,350
your company has certain cultural I'll

740
00:29:08,590 --> 00:29:14,110
say reservations about certain things so

741
00:29:11,350 --> 00:29:15,520
just recently with some of the ransom

742
00:29:14,110 --> 00:29:17,860
payments that made their way into the

743
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:20,170
media has your company actually sat down

744
00:29:17,860 --> 00:29:21,669
with the decision makers and come to the

745
00:29:20,170 --> 00:29:23,950
conclusion that you will over not pay

746
00:29:21,670 --> 00:29:26,290
and that's obviously an extremely

747
00:29:23,950 --> 00:29:28,840
complex conversation that when you're

748
00:29:26,290 --> 00:29:32,260
explaining that to a CEO at the time of

749
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:33,459
incident is a really bad one right or if

750
00:29:32,260 --> 00:29:34,990
you're doing it through the underwriting

751
00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:37,390
presentation if I'm asking that question

752
00:29:34,990 --> 00:29:39,040
I have the ability to influence that

753
00:29:37,390 --> 00:29:41,590
customer and say look this is something

754
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:45,040
that you've got to sit down and do again

755
00:29:41,590 --> 00:29:47,949
fortune 500 CEOs we get it at the same

756
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:49,450
time the rest of the world hasn't had

757
00:29:47,950 --> 00:29:51,010
that conversation so there's elements

758
00:29:49,450 --> 00:29:52,780
there were the culture of the

759
00:29:51,010 --> 00:29:54,790
organization and the culture of the

760
00:29:52,780 --> 00:29:57,250
security team within the organization

761
00:29:54,790 --> 00:29:59,950
can tell us a lot so if I think that the

762
00:29:57,250 --> 00:30:01,510
security team doesn't want to have that

763
00:29:59,950 --> 00:30:04,030
conversation with senior management in

764
00:30:01,510 --> 00:30:08,350
advance that's a sign that's a bad

765
00:30:04,030 --> 00:30:09,940
signal again strategic initiatives I

766
00:30:08,350 --> 00:30:11,980
focus on that I mean it can go across

767
00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:13,900
the organization where are you focused

768
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:14,950
on your spend and why and where are the

769
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:16,990
time frames in which you're going to

770
00:30:14,950 --> 00:30:19,440
implement and then where the where the

771
00:30:16,990 --> 00:30:23,500
barriers to implement you know said

772
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:24,310
improvements I can't tell you a number

773
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:26,200
of times

774
00:30:24,310 --> 00:30:28,540
information governance again becoming

775
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:30,760
more of refer to it as just one of the

776
00:30:28,540 --> 00:30:33,250
other cliches in the cybersecurity space

777
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:34,420
it's not that complicated what data do

778
00:30:33,250 --> 00:30:37,260
you have where is it and how do you

779
00:30:34,420 --> 00:30:40,660
protect it small customers big customers

780
00:30:37,260 --> 00:30:43,930
even midsize customers the simplicity of

781
00:30:40,660 --> 00:30:46,870
that is not that complicated and when we

782
00:30:43,930 --> 00:30:49,720
talk to a risk manager if if you know if

783
00:30:46,870 --> 00:30:51,669
we talk to the C so if the team has to

784
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:54,610
see so most of the time when it's

785
00:30:51,670 --> 00:30:57,500
outsourced that question at a simplistic

786
00:30:54,610 --> 00:30:59,959
level as simplistic as it can get

787
00:30:57,500 --> 00:31:01,820
is a struggle to answer what do you have

788
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:03,559
where is it how is it protected right

789
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:10,549
kind of basic especially for this

790
00:31:03,559 --> 00:31:12,530
audience the plans so I are planning D

791
00:31:10,549 --> 00:31:14,240
our plan and BCP planning you know

792
00:31:12,530 --> 00:31:15,530
that's things that we'll review at times

793
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:17,330
and then that's things that we just

794
00:31:15,530 --> 00:31:19,520
expect they're in place so there's a

795
00:31:17,330 --> 00:31:21,530
different variation there security

796
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:23,900
awareness training mentioned it right so

797
00:31:21,530 --> 00:31:26,090
we are starting to just assume and I

798
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:28,400
don't mean that literally but any large

799
00:31:26,090 --> 00:31:29,780
customer that hasn't recognized that

800
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:31,909
security awareness training at least

801
00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:35,000
does something there is at least some

802
00:31:31,909 --> 00:31:37,460
element of ROI there that's likely a

803
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:39,679
customer that will ultimately be paying

804
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:42,049
more and should be paying more if that

805
00:31:39,679 --> 00:31:44,120
basic isn't covered and so I'd say the

806
00:31:42,049 --> 00:31:46,039
same for multi-factor I'd say the same

807
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:48,408
for offline online backups the different

808
00:31:46,039 --> 00:31:50,320
RTO is all the fun really all the fun

809
00:31:48,409 --> 00:31:52,549
Network security things to talk about

810
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:54,470
where if they're not answering those

811
00:31:52,549 --> 00:31:55,970
sort of questions the right way then the

812
00:31:54,470 --> 00:31:58,669
return on investment as you go up the

813
00:31:55,970 --> 00:32:00,080
technology chain goes away and that's

814
00:31:58,669 --> 00:32:02,840
that's really important I think to this

815
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:04,668
community is is if we're focused on

816
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:08,149
something that does mean there's an

817
00:32:04,669 --> 00:32:09,860
element of basic or at least expected

818
00:32:08,150 --> 00:32:11,780
with whatever customer that we're

819
00:32:09,860 --> 00:32:13,729
talking to it's broad generalization

820
00:32:11,780 --> 00:32:14,990
it's it's obviously a very biased

821
00:32:13,730 --> 00:32:17,360
perspective on the cyber insurance

822
00:32:14,990 --> 00:32:18,890
market overall but really if we're not

823
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:20,870
asking a question that we don't know

824
00:32:18,890 --> 00:32:21,740
what the answer should be then we

825
00:32:20,870 --> 00:32:24,408
shouldn't be answering the question

826
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:27,200
that's insurance underwriting basics and

827
00:32:24,409 --> 00:32:28,789
that's something that as CISOs if you

828
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:30,080
are CISOs or if you are getting the

829
00:32:28,789 --> 00:32:33,230
question that doesn't seem right

830
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:35,270
you should be inquisitive and ask said

831
00:32:33,230 --> 00:32:37,220
underwriter that's great why are you

832
00:32:35,270 --> 00:32:39,710
asking that question you know because

833
00:32:37,220 --> 00:32:41,360
cyber insurance is new we even joke

834
00:32:39,710 --> 00:32:43,190
sometimes we should just ask fake

835
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:45,260
questions and see if the market actually

836
00:32:43,190 --> 00:32:46,610
goes that direction we wouldn't do that

837
00:32:45,260 --> 00:32:48,350
it's probably not in the best interest

838
00:32:46,610 --> 00:32:51,860
of the market overall but that's the

839
00:32:48,350 --> 00:32:53,270
reality of where we're in today again

840
00:32:51,860 --> 00:32:55,689
active defense threat intelligence

841
00:32:53,270 --> 00:32:58,730
things that are what would a lot of

842
00:32:55,690 --> 00:33:01,190
folks here is obvious but that's also

843
00:32:58,730 --> 00:33:03,590
part of the conversation

844
00:33:01,190 --> 00:33:06,590
now privacy and so obviously the

845
00:33:03,590 --> 00:33:08,928
security versus privacy issue with gdpr

846
00:33:06,590 --> 00:33:10,929
with CCPA with china cyber security law

847
00:33:08,929 --> 00:33:13,809
you know i've run the gamut

848
00:33:10,930 --> 00:33:16,690
right up Illinois biometrics you know

849
00:33:13,809 --> 00:33:18,250
this is also cyber insurance now most of

850
00:33:16,690 --> 00:33:20,050
you in the room would think why is this

851
00:33:18,250 --> 00:33:22,930
cyber insurance but cyber insurance

852
00:33:20,050 --> 00:33:26,020
almost started as privacy insurance so

853
00:33:22,930 --> 00:33:27,670
as cyber security controls go up as the

854
00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:29,830
regulation and the enforcement goes up

855
00:33:27,670 --> 00:33:32,710
we're also trying to balance that from a

856
00:33:29,830 --> 00:33:35,139
pricing perspective and I will get into

857
00:33:32,710 --> 00:33:37,120
pricing and actuarial methodology and

858
00:33:35,140 --> 00:33:39,130
all that fun stuff but that's also

859
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:40,750
something that's changing exponentially

860
00:33:39,130 --> 00:33:42,610
almost every day inclusive of

861
00:33:40,750 --> 00:33:47,260
enforcement inclusive of values of

862
00:33:42,610 --> 00:33:50,678
enforcement okay and I'm hoping most of

863
00:33:47,260 --> 00:33:52,320
you saw the Netflix documentary on the

864
00:33:50,679 --> 00:33:55,270
prices right where the god memorized

865
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:57,220
every single price of every single

866
00:33:55,270 --> 00:33:59,710
product on the price of right price is

867
00:33:57,220 --> 00:34:03,390
right but unfortunately he's still lost

868
00:33:59,710 --> 00:34:07,330
right so I have this in you know again

869
00:34:03,390 --> 00:34:09,310
pricing is is an important topic but

870
00:34:07,330 --> 00:34:11,830
it's also a topic that's had 20 years of

871
00:34:09,310 --> 00:34:14,770
experience and it's gonna have about 200

872
00:34:11,830 --> 00:34:16,418
years of analysis right so one of the

873
00:34:14,770 --> 00:34:18,639
other challenges with insurance is that

874
00:34:16,418 --> 00:34:21,520
the pricing especially in a liability

875
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:25,330
setting we don't know the true cost

876
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:26,770
until maybe six to seven years after so

877
00:34:25,330 --> 00:34:30,129
when you know when you read the the

878
00:34:26,770 --> 00:34:31,449
headlines as to profitability there's

879
00:34:30,129 --> 00:34:33,429
also a lot of different components

880
00:34:31,449 --> 00:34:35,350
within that that you have to just

881
00:34:33,429 --> 00:34:38,139
recognize and when you see some carriers

882
00:34:35,350 --> 00:34:40,389
have 0% loss ratio whereas others are

883
00:34:38,139 --> 00:34:43,090
over 400% you're starting to see some

884
00:34:40,389 --> 00:34:44,889
strategy at least arise that is

885
00:34:43,090 --> 00:34:46,810
informing a little bit better risk

886
00:34:44,889 --> 00:34:48,550
posture and that's something that is a

887
00:34:46,810 --> 00:34:54,149
challenge as the market continues to

888
00:34:48,550 --> 00:34:57,250
grow in numbers okay so aggregation so

889
00:34:54,149 --> 00:35:00,100
again how we price I mentioned the 347

890
00:34:57,250 --> 00:35:02,830
different factors a lot of a lot of

891
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:04,990
markets focus on revenues some focus on

892
00:35:02,830 --> 00:35:06,970
total assets some will focus on end

893
00:35:04,990 --> 00:35:09,669
points some will focus on employee count

894
00:35:06,970 --> 00:35:13,000
but that's good because if one of those

895
00:35:09,670 --> 00:35:15,040
is indicative of the correct pricing the

896
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:18,430
insurance industry has it has a tendency

897
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:21,660
to solve for that as we gather more data

898
00:35:18,430 --> 00:35:24,210
now I mentioned they get the cyber index

899
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:25,470
that's also important as we correlate

900
00:35:24,210 --> 00:35:27,150
and cross-correlate some of the

901
00:35:25,470 --> 00:35:30,209
different events that we're seeing to

902
00:35:27,150 --> 00:35:32,070
the actual data with a lot more data as

903
00:35:30,210 --> 00:35:33,900
we pull in and start to work a lot more

904
00:35:32,070 --> 00:35:34,530
with technology providers such as

905
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:37,770
yourselves

906
00:35:34,530 --> 00:35:40,320
so aggregation okay this is a topic and

907
00:35:37,770 --> 00:35:42,509
this is a key topic for cyber insurers

908
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:45,840
as it stands today and it has to be a

909
00:35:42,510 --> 00:35:48,840
topic right so as you know as not not

910
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:50,250
petty as the example a lot of insurance

911
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:52,890
regulators want to make sure that

912
00:35:50,250 --> 00:35:54,690
insurance can insurance providers can

913
00:35:52,890 --> 00:35:56,970
play pay the claims and the promises

914
00:35:54,690 --> 00:35:59,670
that they've made pretty basic right

915
00:35:56,970 --> 00:36:03,419
when we deal with a tornado when we deal

916
00:35:59,670 --> 00:36:06,480
with a hurricane we do have a tendency

917
00:36:03,420 --> 00:36:08,400
to know our aggregation now a lot of

918
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:10,080
those tools that even exist they haven't

919
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:11,940
been around for that long

920
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:14,100
Kath modeling tools in the property

921
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:16,860
spaces have been around at most forty

922
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:19,319
years and so that seems somewhat

923
00:36:16,860 --> 00:36:21,600
surprising but it's also sowing somewhat

924
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:24,060
of an element of the data usage and the

925
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:26,250
ability to model is being driven so much

926
00:36:24,060 --> 00:36:27,930
by data and the availability of data so

927
00:36:26,250 --> 00:36:30,210
go back to kind of the Lloyds

928
00:36:27,930 --> 00:36:31,740
coffeehouse they weren't learning about

929
00:36:30,210 --> 00:36:33,720
things until six months just because

930
00:36:31,740 --> 00:36:36,660
phones you know didn't exist which is

931
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:39,029
somewhat obvious now we're starting to

932
00:36:36,660 --> 00:36:41,609
focus and the regulator the regulatory

933
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:43,380
industry is focusing on how are you

934
00:36:41,610 --> 00:36:45,780
underwriting these risks what's your

935
00:36:43,380 --> 00:36:47,970
strategy does it again does it make

936
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:50,460
sense but they want to see that there's

937
00:36:47,970 --> 00:36:52,830
formula and strategy around each and

938
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:55,800
every single account but also at a

939
00:36:52,830 --> 00:36:57,660
portfolio level as well and as an

940
00:36:55,800 --> 00:37:01,260
example do you have the claims

941
00:36:57,660 --> 00:37:03,210
capability to pay for these events and

942
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:05,820
do you have the bandwidth to handle some

943
00:37:03,210 --> 00:37:07,590
of the big systemic events so that's a

944
00:37:05,820 --> 00:37:09,570
focus of regulators that should be your

945
00:37:07,590 --> 00:37:12,600
focus as you think about cyber insurance

946
00:37:09,570 --> 00:37:13,980
is again Jake mentioned a couple

947
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:16,589
different service providers if they were

948
00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:18,480
to go down even though it's outside your

949
00:37:16,590 --> 00:37:20,430
environment what does that mean for you

950
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:22,370
as a security professional and it

951
00:37:20,430 --> 00:37:25,470
typically will mean something impactful

952
00:37:22,370 --> 00:37:27,480
and so you'll typically need an incident

953
00:37:25,470 --> 00:37:29,549
response process that addresses that and

954
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:31,920
then once you recognize that the

955
00:37:29,550 --> 00:37:33,450
entirety of that entire space is tied up

956
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:35,310
with the same event

957
00:37:33,450 --> 00:37:37,529
and where you focused and so the the

958
00:37:35,310 --> 00:37:39,630
cyber insurance industry is starting to

959
00:37:37,530 --> 00:37:42,119
do a lot more work associating that with

960
00:37:39,630 --> 00:37:43,800
the systemic event and making sure that

961
00:37:42,119 --> 00:37:45,240
the Incident Response processes of all

962
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:50,310
the customers

963
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:51,868
there's bandwidth for that just a basic

964
00:37:50,310 --> 00:37:53,700
and this may be to coverage heavy so I

965
00:37:51,869 --> 00:37:57,119
want to leave it good amount of time for

966
00:37:53,700 --> 00:38:00,359
questions but silence cyber is also a

967
00:37:57,119 --> 00:38:02,910
topic and what silent cyber means is

968
00:38:00,359 --> 00:38:06,299
ultimately insurance products that

969
00:38:02,910 --> 00:38:10,410
existed prior to cyber insurance that

970
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:14,190
ultimately either affirmative ly covered

971
00:38:10,410 --> 00:38:16,259
cyber risk or if it's silent there's no

972
00:38:14,190 --> 00:38:19,920
clarity or there is ambiguity as it

973
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:22,829
relates to if a cyber triggered event

974
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:24,690
triggers that product and so that sounds

975
00:38:22,829 --> 00:38:27,150
again to those outside the insurance

976
00:38:24,690 --> 00:38:29,640
industry way too complicated but it is

977
00:38:27,150 --> 00:38:32,010
an extremely big topic in the insurance

978
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:33,900
industry today and for a variety of

979
00:38:32,010 --> 00:38:36,030
different reasons right so clarity of

980
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:38,010
coverage customers want to know what

981
00:38:36,030 --> 00:38:39,599
they're buying and which products but

982
00:38:38,010 --> 00:38:41,250
they also want to understand how cyber

983
00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:44,490
risk influences and impacts those

984
00:38:41,250 --> 00:38:46,740
products customers also want to

985
00:38:44,490 --> 00:38:48,209
understand how certain cyber risks are

986
00:38:46,740 --> 00:38:53,060
impacting their traditional way of

987
00:38:48,210 --> 00:38:55,890
thinking right so with the IOT device

988
00:38:53,060 --> 00:38:57,839
just be obvious right I don't need to

989
00:38:55,890 --> 00:39:00,150
tell this crowd with the exponential

990
00:38:57,839 --> 00:39:02,700
increase in dependency but that's a

991
00:39:00,150 --> 00:39:05,160
problem right so as we look at some of

992
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:07,200
the some of the scenarios that we model

993
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:09,899
for and again this range is anywhere

994
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:11,399
from distributed you know denial service

995
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:12,000
on a certain industry or a broad

996
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:14,490
industry

997
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:16,950
this is DNS attacks the net and again

998
00:39:14,490 --> 00:39:18,629
there's examples of real of this

999
00:39:16,950 --> 00:39:20,578
actually happening where we will back

1000
00:39:18,630 --> 00:39:22,380
cast and look at how that would impact

1001
00:39:20,579 --> 00:39:24,470
our portfolio there's also technology

1002
00:39:22,380 --> 00:39:27,089
startups that are focused solely on

1003
00:39:24,470 --> 00:39:32,160
getting at cyber aggregation which is

1004
00:39:27,089 --> 00:39:34,849
really important again I mentioned you

1005
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:37,049
know cap modeling this is not a

1006
00:39:34,849 --> 00:39:40,319
tried-and-true thing even in the

1007
00:39:37,050 --> 00:39:44,310
property space so Hurricane Andrew which

1008
00:39:40,319 --> 00:39:46,670
is only 25 years ago was a moment in the

1009
00:39:44,310 --> 00:39:49,100
insurance industry that ultimately said

1010
00:39:46,670 --> 00:39:49,790
Wow we don't have a sense of our

1011
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:53,180
aggregation

1012
00:39:49,790 --> 00:39:56,240
we need to solve for this so when we now

1013
00:39:53,180 --> 00:39:58,850
again 25 years later using data using

1014
00:39:56,240 --> 00:40:00,830
analytics using modeling we now

1015
00:39:58,850 --> 00:40:03,049
collectively as the insurance industry

1016
00:40:00,830 --> 00:40:04,549
feel that we have a better sense prior

1017
00:40:03,050 --> 00:40:06,290
to something like that

1018
00:40:04,550 --> 00:40:07,550
the reality is is there's certain things

1019
00:40:06,290 --> 00:40:10,130
that have occurred that weren't

1020
00:40:07,550 --> 00:40:12,470
contemplated again wildfires is the

1021
00:40:10,130 --> 00:40:14,300
other example where is that model is

1022
00:40:12,470 --> 00:40:16,910
that modeled correctly or is that a non

1023
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:19,070
model of exposure so really we're this

1024
00:40:16,910 --> 00:40:20,149
is the cyber insurance market and even

1025
00:40:19,070 --> 00:40:22,880
the regulator's within the insurance

1026
00:40:20,150 --> 00:40:26,240
industry have actually learned a lot

1027
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:28,400
from prior products especially when it

1028
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:31,100
comes to aggregation but we have so much

1029
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:32,780
more to go when it comes to the specific

1030
00:40:31,100 --> 00:40:36,370
threats and the specific technologies

1031
00:40:32,780 --> 00:40:40,490
that could expose large vast portfolios

1032
00:40:36,370 --> 00:40:42,980
and so you know again I'm focused on a

1033
00:40:40,490 --> 00:40:45,350
lot of different things and there isn't

1034
00:40:42,980 --> 00:40:46,670
one idea that's too while right we

1035
00:40:45,350 --> 00:40:48,950
actually have a team that is focused

1036
00:40:46,670 --> 00:40:50,900
specifically on what are the emerging

1037
00:40:48,950 --> 00:40:53,089
risks they have security background

1038
00:40:50,900 --> 00:40:54,890
they've got underwriting background and

1039
00:40:53,090 --> 00:40:57,080
we're also collaborating throughout the

1040
00:40:54,890 --> 00:40:59,480
industry with what's next right so we

1041
00:40:57,080 --> 00:41:03,110
want to know what everyone thinks is the

1042
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:05,480
obvious systemic event one example and

1043
00:41:03,110 --> 00:41:07,310
I'll go back to now petia when we're

1044
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:09,860
meeting with large customers right and

1045
00:41:07,310 --> 00:41:11,450
when we sit down and when we learn from

1046
00:41:09,860 --> 00:41:13,670
past events and all of reference wanna

1047
00:41:11,450 --> 00:41:16,009
cry and there was a pretty short time

1048
00:41:13,670 --> 00:41:17,930
period in between we sat down and we

1049
00:41:16,010 --> 00:41:20,240
wanted to understand how companies were

1050
00:41:17,930 --> 00:41:21,620
impacted by that but we also sat down

1051
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:23,029
and wanted to make sure that we're

1052
00:41:21,620 --> 00:41:26,000
thinking about these things the right

1053
00:41:23,030 --> 00:41:29,150
way there's not one individual and again

1054
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:31,130
unless there could be caveats in the

1055
00:41:29,150 --> 00:41:32,810
audience but there wasn't one individual

1056
00:41:31,130 --> 00:41:35,390
that said you should be asking your

1057
00:41:32,810 --> 00:41:37,730
clients for are using backdoor tax

1058
00:41:35,390 --> 00:41:39,920
accounting software in the Ukraine now

1059
00:41:37,730 --> 00:41:41,420
if I ask that question prior to it

1060
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:43,940
happening I'd probably be arrested

1061
00:41:41,420 --> 00:41:46,100
within minutes the next day that's not

1062
00:41:43,940 --> 00:41:47,600
what anyone was focused on that's

1063
00:41:46,100 --> 00:41:49,190
something that as the cyber insurance

1064
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:50,750
industry starts to look at modeling it

1065
00:41:49,190 --> 00:41:53,180
starts to look at systemic aggregation

1066
00:41:50,750 --> 00:41:54,740
where are the common applications where

1067
00:41:53,180 --> 00:41:56,540
are the common service providers and

1068
00:41:54,740 --> 00:41:58,669
where are the dependencies that we can

1069
00:41:56,540 --> 00:41:59,960
get our hands on and that's really

1070
00:41:58,670 --> 00:42:03,590
starting to happen

1071
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:05,840
so we look at again using a few

1072
00:42:03,590 --> 00:42:07,400
different tools thread Intel that a lot

1073
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:09,920
of you offer or at least use in the room

1074
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:12,050
what are the bad actors want to want to

1075
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:14,090
do who is it and then what's their

1076
00:42:12,050 --> 00:42:15,710
accessibility to that and then we look

1077
00:42:14,090 --> 00:42:17,780
through the kill chain analysis and a

1078
00:42:15,710 --> 00:42:19,730
variety of different things but we then

1079
00:42:17,780 --> 00:42:21,500
take our portfolio with the concepts

1080
00:42:19,730 --> 00:42:24,860
that we learned in property insurance

1081
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:27,350
and fire insurance and even marine back

1082
00:42:24,860 --> 00:42:29,720
in the 1700s and apply that methodology

1083
00:42:27,350 --> 00:42:31,339
to ensure that we are actually getting

1084
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:34,100
paid adequately for that catastrophic

1085
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:37,370
systemic risk it is still an outstanding

1086
00:42:34,100 --> 00:42:39,290
item which obviously as the different

1087
00:42:37,370 --> 00:42:42,680
threats change as the vulnerabilities

1088
00:42:39,290 --> 00:42:44,150
that you change exponentially and I know

1089
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:47,029
sat through a couple unsettling

1090
00:42:44,150 --> 00:42:48,920
unnerving sessions already today this

1091
00:42:47,030 --> 00:42:50,450
stuff is changing and and so it's it's

1092
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:52,280
really important it's catastrophe

1093
00:42:50,450 --> 00:42:54,859
modeling is part of the cyber insurance

1094
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:57,560
community and with 700 different

1095
00:42:54,860 --> 00:42:59,990
insurers that's a act that's a pretty

1096
00:42:57,560 --> 00:43:04,070
big undertaking so it's important to

1097
00:42:59,990 --> 00:43:06,350
think look this is again cyber is new in

1098
00:43:04,070 --> 00:43:07,670
an in relative terms but some of the

1099
00:43:06,350 --> 00:43:09,040
things we're learning can also inform

1100
00:43:07,670 --> 00:43:11,390
some of the products you guys are making

1101
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:14,120
so let me just I'll talk a little bit

1102
00:43:11,390 --> 00:43:16,400
about kind of the the evolution and

1103
00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:20,779
where we've kind of come right so 20

1104
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:23,120
years 20 years ago it was ultimately

1105
00:43:20,780 --> 00:43:25,130
focused on enterprises now there's more

1106
00:43:23,120 --> 00:43:26,509
focus on you know strategies that are

1107
00:43:25,130 --> 00:43:31,700
becoming either successful or

1108
00:43:26,510 --> 00:43:33,620
unsuccessful right if if if I'm a market

1109
00:43:31,700 --> 00:43:35,629
who thinks that I should write all GE

1110
00:43:33,620 --> 00:43:38,180
all business in the Ukraine then I'm

1111
00:43:35,630 --> 00:43:41,270
probably not doing business anymore in

1112
00:43:38,180 --> 00:43:43,339
cyber insurance if we have tools that

1113
00:43:41,270 --> 00:43:44,600
can start to show us the aggregation if

1114
00:43:43,340 --> 00:43:46,160
we have tools they can give us a little

1115
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:48,200
bit more account specific visibility

1116
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:50,690
which we do collectively have an

1117
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:52,399
insurance market that can also start to

1118
00:43:50,690 --> 00:43:54,290
inform a little bit better decisions

1119
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:56,180
when it comes to how we interact with

1120
00:43:54,290 --> 00:43:57,470
clients we also at the point of

1121
00:43:56,180 --> 00:44:00,680
basically making sure that anything that

1122
00:43:57,470 --> 00:44:02,569
we can offer is digestible to the

1123
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:05,089
broader community so as an example an

1124
00:44:02,570 --> 00:44:07,610
enterprise customer if we're asking you

1125
00:44:05,090 --> 00:44:08,690
know what are the the security you know

1126
00:44:07,610 --> 00:44:10,700
the security companies that you're

1127
00:44:08,690 --> 00:44:11,610
looking at is third parties we know the

1128
00:44:10,700 --> 00:44:14,339
list so

1129
00:44:11,610 --> 00:44:15,690
see so at a fortune 500 but also what

1130
00:44:14,340 --> 00:44:17,790
can we offer to some of our smaller

1131
00:44:15,690 --> 00:44:19,530
clients that can inform them a little

1132
00:44:17,790 --> 00:44:21,540
bit better and that's why I do think

1133
00:44:19,530 --> 00:44:23,100
that there's a need for more interaction

1134
00:44:21,540 --> 00:44:25,470
and there's more interaction happening

1135
00:44:23,100 --> 00:44:27,779
almost with every market and every

1136
00:44:25,470 --> 00:44:31,200
security provider as we go year to year

1137
00:44:27,780 --> 00:44:33,240
to year so that's a good thing more

1138
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:35,879
insights into the events themselves us

1139
00:44:33,240 --> 00:44:37,799
sharing claims data can help a lot of

1140
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:40,530
different people right just being able

1141
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:42,390
to relate to and then just raise

1142
00:44:40,530 --> 00:44:44,010
awareness over what's actually happening

1143
00:44:42,390 --> 00:44:46,109
versus what everyone reads in the media

1144
00:44:44,010 --> 00:44:48,210
in the headlines and that's that's

1145
00:44:46,110 --> 00:44:49,800
important in within our with them within

1146
00:44:48,210 --> 00:44:52,020
our company we actually have a team that

1147
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:54,660
will look through all the threat you

1148
00:44:52,020 --> 00:44:56,550
know the the threat Intel all the media

1149
00:44:54,660 --> 00:44:59,310
reports in either validate or invalidate

1150
00:44:56,550 --> 00:45:00,720
some of the the misnomers that's really

1151
00:44:59,310 --> 00:45:03,060
important so that we don't start to

1152
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:04,919
overreact to certain things in under

1153
00:45:03,060 --> 00:45:06,540
react to others which is also very much

1154
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:08,580
what a cyber security professional does

1155
00:45:06,540 --> 00:45:10,590
what do you need to be what do you need

1156
00:45:08,580 --> 00:45:13,009
to be aware of versus what's more like

1157
00:45:10,590 --> 00:45:15,120
noise and you can see it even in the

1158
00:45:13,010 --> 00:45:20,580
some of the advertising that I'm seeing

1159
00:45:15,120 --> 00:45:23,910
in the at the conference the attritional

1160
00:45:20,580 --> 00:45:26,850
losses so ultimately telling customers

1161
00:45:23,910 --> 00:45:29,339
what ransomware is you know to the to

1162
00:45:26,850 --> 00:45:31,650
the fortune ten fortune 100 don't need

1163
00:45:29,340 --> 00:45:33,990
it to the small business this is like a

1164
00:45:31,650 --> 00:45:36,090
new thing and that's that's part of the

1165
00:45:33,990 --> 00:45:39,209
problem where we have a lot of data to

1166
00:45:36,090 --> 00:45:41,580
support kind of the offline RTOS and the

1167
00:45:39,210 --> 00:45:42,960
importance of online backups whereas

1168
00:45:41,580 --> 00:45:45,480
this is the first time they're hearing

1169
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:47,640
these things which is a sign that we

1170
00:45:45,480 --> 00:45:50,070
collectively and I say this you know

1171
00:45:47,640 --> 00:45:53,400
with sincerity we're not getting out

1172
00:45:50,070 --> 00:45:55,470
enough to into those kind of more SME

1173
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:57,900
really just the education levels aren't

1174
00:45:55,470 --> 00:45:58,259
there that goes across really society in

1175
00:45:57,900 --> 00:46:00,660
general

1176
00:45:58,260 --> 00:46:03,360
culturally we don't get cybersecurity

1177
00:46:00,660 --> 00:46:05,220
which is a problem the insurance

1178
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:09,960
community is starting to at least go up

1179
00:46:05,220 --> 00:46:11,609
a different channel or basically showing

1180
00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:13,020
how important some of the things that

1181
00:46:11,610 --> 00:46:15,810
this this audience does from a

1182
00:46:13,020 --> 00:46:18,270
cybersecurity perspective now hearing it

1183
00:46:15,810 --> 00:46:20,580
from a risk manager and Industry and an

1184
00:46:18,270 --> 00:46:22,140
insurance decision-maker might influence

1185
00:46:20,580 --> 00:46:25,009
some of the buying behaviors and that's

1186
00:46:22,140 --> 00:46:28,950
really what needs to happen

1187
00:46:25,010 --> 00:46:31,770
education so just as an example you know

1188
00:46:28,950 --> 00:46:33,569
educating our own agents and brokers you

1189
00:46:31,770 --> 00:46:36,600
know aside from educating our own

1190
00:46:33,570 --> 00:46:39,180
underwriters is really really key to be

1191
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:41,460
able to sell cyber insurance but it's

1192
00:46:39,180 --> 00:46:42,839
also key to analyze companies and make

1193
00:46:41,460 --> 00:46:45,030
sure that you understand exactly what

1194
00:46:42,840 --> 00:46:47,040
your underwriting just as an example to

1195
00:46:45,030 --> 00:46:48,660
show a little bit of that correlation we

1196
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:50,430
worked with Carnegie Mellon launched an

1197
00:46:48,660 --> 00:46:52,460
actual certification course on what

1198
00:46:50,430 --> 00:46:54,779
cyber insurance is and they've been very

1199
00:46:52,460 --> 00:46:57,060
present obviously in the CSO community

1200
00:46:54,780 --> 00:46:59,220
doing the same thing even in the chief

1201
00:46:57,060 --> 00:47:01,259
risk officer community as well so almost

1202
00:46:59,220 --> 00:47:03,810
just cross pollinating that audience

1203
00:47:01,260 --> 00:47:05,670
just as one carry as an example is

1204
00:47:03,810 --> 00:47:09,150
really just an example of what really

1205
00:47:05,670 --> 00:47:12,180
could be on the horizon the underwriting

1206
00:47:09,150 --> 00:47:14,760
or the claims process so this is an area

1207
00:47:12,180 --> 00:47:15,930
that understanding that we have over ten

1208
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:18,270
people dealing with cyber insurance

1209
00:47:15,930 --> 00:47:21,210
claims and we're seeing over four to

1210
00:47:18,270 --> 00:47:23,040
five a day is really important right so

1211
00:47:21,210 --> 00:47:26,370
when we talk to our claims team this is

1212
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:27,390
not your traditional claims adjuster

1213
00:47:26,370 --> 00:47:30,120
that you see in some of the

1214
00:47:27,390 --> 00:47:32,569
advertisements on TV these folks are

1215
00:47:30,120 --> 00:47:35,130
dialed in on ultimately everything from

1216
00:47:32,570 --> 00:47:39,180
you know Sampson which we haven't seen

1217
00:47:35,130 --> 00:47:40,770
obviously since late 2018 to Rio to all

1218
00:47:39,180 --> 00:47:42,960
the different variants of malware and

1219
00:47:40,770 --> 00:47:44,490
they know specifically again the

1220
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:47,160
importance of cyber insurance is knowing

1221
00:47:44,490 --> 00:47:49,740
who to call Jake alluded to that but

1222
00:47:47,160 --> 00:47:52,410
it's also knowing the tendencies of

1223
00:47:49,740 --> 00:47:54,629
whichever bad actor that we are

1224
00:47:52,410 --> 00:47:55,950
interacting with again I use the term we

1225
00:47:54,630 --> 00:47:58,500
loosely really the cyber insurance

1226
00:47:55,950 --> 00:48:00,689
market overall but how much how much

1227
00:47:58,500 --> 00:48:03,150
more valuable that is to to the end the

1228
00:48:00,690 --> 00:48:06,570
end policy holder or the insured

1229
00:48:03,150 --> 00:48:08,250
themselves and again learning from past

1230
00:48:06,570 --> 00:48:10,260
events is what we don't insurance

1231
00:48:08,250 --> 00:48:13,770
history and if any underwriter says look

1232
00:48:10,260 --> 00:48:15,660
I I didn't really learn from wanna cry I

1233
00:48:13,770 --> 00:48:17,160
didn't learn from not petia then they

1234
00:48:15,660 --> 00:48:18,629
shouldn't be underwriting cyber

1235
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:21,120
insurance so there's an element there

1236
00:48:18,630 --> 00:48:24,150
where it's important as we kind of cross

1237
00:48:21,120 --> 00:48:25,560
pollinate that this audience starts to

1238
00:48:24,150 --> 00:48:27,840
understand that this cyber insurance

1239
00:48:25,560 --> 00:48:30,029
thing again it's a four billion dollar

1240
00:48:27,840 --> 00:48:32,280
industry there's different variants of

1241
00:48:30,030 --> 00:48:33,600
different cyber insurance they really

1242
00:48:32,280 --> 00:48:35,500
have to keep in mind and it's really

1243
00:48:33,600 --> 00:48:37,779
important they understand

1244
00:48:35,500 --> 00:48:39,790
I've got about two and a half or three

1245
00:48:37,780 --> 00:48:43,170
minutes for questions if there's

1246
00:48:39,790 --> 00:48:43,170
questions yeah

1247
00:49:25,589 --> 00:49:31,269
so I'm gonna repeat the question gonna

1248
00:49:28,420 --> 00:49:33,549
kind of maybe shorten it up a little bit

1249
00:49:31,269 --> 00:49:37,990
but with the advent of IOT connected

1250
00:49:33,549 --> 00:49:40,059
cars you know airplanes obviously from a

1251
00:49:37,990 --> 00:49:42,008
software perspective how does cyber

1252
00:49:40,059 --> 00:49:44,769
insurance view that cyber insurance

1253
00:49:42,009 --> 00:49:47,049
underwriters are dialed in specifically

1254
00:49:44,769 --> 00:49:49,299
to that and then from a coverage

1255
00:49:47,049 --> 00:49:51,609
perspective understanding the nuances of

1256
00:49:49,299 --> 00:49:53,230
coverage and kind of the coordination of

1257
00:49:51,609 --> 00:49:55,749
coverage across different products it's

1258
00:49:53,230 --> 00:49:56,710
where property and casualty and some of

1259
00:49:55,749 --> 00:50:00,098
the different kind of more traditional

1260
00:49:56,710 --> 00:50:02,680
products either explicitly do cover or

1261
00:50:00,099 --> 00:50:04,779
explicitly don't cover that's a big

1262
00:50:02,680 --> 00:50:07,779
topic within the insurance industry so

1263
00:50:04,779 --> 00:50:10,990
the eyes wide open awareness of how

1264
00:50:07,779 --> 00:50:13,869
that's happening I'd say generally cyber

1265
00:50:10,990 --> 00:50:15,669
insurance underwriters get that I'd say

1266
00:50:13,869 --> 00:50:17,799
more specifically the broader

1267
00:50:15,670 --> 00:50:21,029
underwriter of more traditional lines

1268
00:50:17,799 --> 00:50:24,069
may not get the into you know the the

1269
00:50:21,029 --> 00:50:25,930
the significance of that in their

1270
00:50:24,069 --> 00:50:27,549
products which really gets at the silent

1271
00:50:25,930 --> 00:50:30,759
cyber concern from a lot of the

1272
00:50:27,549 --> 00:50:31,900
regulator's where regulators want to

1273
00:50:30,759 --> 00:50:34,900
make sure that the underwriting

1274
00:50:31,900 --> 00:50:36,369
community understands cyber risk the

1275
00:50:34,900 --> 00:50:39,039
problem that we have which I think is

1276
00:50:36,369 --> 00:50:40,900
also a problem that you have is that the

1277
00:50:39,039 --> 00:50:44,109
cybersecurity insurance underwriter

1278
00:50:40,900 --> 00:50:48,009
community still is small and the

1279
00:50:44,109 --> 00:50:49,660
education level is going up and the

1280
00:50:48,009 --> 00:50:51,579
broader underwriting community again a

1281
00:50:49,660 --> 00:50:53,170
property underwriter there are some very

1282
00:50:51,579 --> 00:50:55,269
good property underwriters that

1283
00:50:53,170 --> 00:50:58,119
understand cyber risk there are also

1284
00:50:55,269 --> 00:51:00,308
some very bad property underwriters that

1285
00:50:58,119 --> 00:51:02,319
don't understand cyber risk and then

1286
00:51:00,309 --> 00:51:04,569
there's also good property underwriters

1287
00:51:02,319 --> 00:51:06,579
they don't need to understand cyber risk

1288
00:51:04,569 --> 00:51:09,519
just yet so there's a lot on the horizon

1289
00:51:06,579 --> 00:51:11,109
and I hoping I answered the specificity

1290
00:51:09,519 --> 00:51:13,538
if you want to go into more like

1291
00:51:11,109 --> 00:51:15,098
coverage interaction there's a lot of

1292
00:51:13,539 --> 00:51:16,599
different products that either launched

1293
00:51:15,099 --> 00:51:18,730
in the last four or five years that

1294
00:51:16,599 --> 00:51:20,529
actually will coordinate that coverage

1295
00:51:18,730 --> 00:51:22,930
for you so that it's at the advantage of

1296
00:51:20,529 --> 00:51:25,930
a customer and that that actually could

1297
00:51:22,930 --> 00:51:27,290
go off on a tangent that be happy to get

1298
00:51:25,930 --> 00:51:29,890
into more detail

1299
00:51:27,290 --> 00:51:29,890
yeah

1300
00:51:32,780 --> 00:51:38,090
so cyber hygiene score so a couple of

1301
00:51:35,480 --> 00:51:40,370
several different tools I'll range

1302
00:51:38,090 --> 00:51:43,450
anywhere from security scorecard to bits

1303
00:51:40,370 --> 00:51:46,330
I to a lot of different others that

1304
00:51:43,450 --> 00:51:48,770
apologize if I'm if I'm missing a few

1305
00:51:46,330 --> 00:51:51,860
but that ultimately gives an underwriter

1306
00:51:48,770 --> 00:51:54,290
an outside-in perspective it can tell us

1307
00:51:51,860 --> 00:51:56,720
something and again I'm saying us as in

1308
00:51:54,290 --> 00:51:59,420
the cyber insurance community but it

1309
00:51:56,720 --> 00:52:02,629
also gives you elements of that's the

1310
00:51:59,420 --> 00:52:05,150
short version of really what could be

1311
00:52:02,630 --> 00:52:07,220
useful data useful information in the

1312
00:52:05,150 --> 00:52:09,020
long term it could also be useful

1313
00:52:07,220 --> 00:52:11,180
information in the short term that

1314
00:52:09,020 --> 00:52:13,880
either is validated or invalidated by

1315
00:52:11,180 --> 00:52:18,770
claims so a score again some markets

1316
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:20,480
will use their own score some won't it's

1317
00:52:18,770 --> 00:52:22,940
really important that whatever that

1318
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:25,190
hygiene score it actually goes to that

1319
00:52:22,940 --> 00:52:28,040
profit margin so that everyone

1320
00:52:25,190 --> 00:52:30,020
understands why that hygiene again using

1321
00:52:28,040 --> 00:52:33,020
cyber hygiene score because you use the

1322
00:52:30,020 --> 00:52:35,630
term but that's important so if there is

1323
00:52:33,020 --> 00:52:38,360
a accurate cyber hygiene score that's

1324
00:52:35,630 --> 00:52:40,970
predictable and relating back to claims

1325
00:52:38,360 --> 00:52:43,310
and loss ratio than any underwriter that

1326
00:52:40,970 --> 00:52:45,230
has that should be sharing whatever

1327
00:52:43,310 --> 00:52:48,470
elements there are that are important I

1328
00:52:45,230 --> 00:52:50,330
think the challenge right now is is some

1329
00:52:48,470 --> 00:52:52,040
of those scoring tools and technologies

1330
00:52:50,330 --> 00:52:54,110
they can help and they can add some

1331
00:52:52,040 --> 00:52:57,950
element of margin but there isn't that

1332
00:52:54,110 --> 00:52:59,360
once you know salt solve all product

1333
00:52:57,950 --> 00:53:02,629
much like a lot of the tools and

1334
00:52:59,360 --> 00:53:04,250
products that we all deal with is is if

1335
00:53:02,630 --> 00:53:05,780
you have a product the cyber insurance

1336
00:53:04,250 --> 00:53:09,050
industry wants to know about it and

1337
00:53:05,780 --> 00:53:10,550
that's I mean that sincerely is you know

1338
00:53:09,050 --> 00:53:13,640
we're all afraid that we're gonna miss

1339
00:53:10,550 --> 00:53:19,390
the next product or tool that ultimately

1340
00:53:13,640 --> 00:53:19,390
does stop incidents yeah

1341
00:53:21,720 --> 00:53:26,439
yeah so the question is how do we

1342
00:53:24,010 --> 00:53:30,280
incorporate chubs own seaso into our

1343
00:53:26,440 --> 00:53:32,109
underwriting process I couldn't have

1344
00:53:30,280 --> 00:53:34,109
made up a better question but I'm glad

1345
00:53:32,109 --> 00:53:37,420
to answer that so we actually hired on

1346
00:53:34,109 --> 00:53:39,460
our former global security architect to

1347
00:53:37,420 --> 00:53:42,250
be part of the underwriting slash risk

1348
00:53:39,460 --> 00:53:45,130
engineering team and then we also again

1349
00:53:42,250 --> 00:53:47,740
anytime that we're faced from a from an

1350
00:53:45,130 --> 00:53:49,299
executive management perspective we want

1351
00:53:47,740 --> 00:53:51,040
to make sure we're gut check ins the

1352
00:53:49,299 --> 00:53:52,930
right way so that we're using all

1353
00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:55,329
available methods of data that we have

1354
00:53:52,930 --> 00:53:58,868
at our disposal interacting with our

1355
00:53:55,329 --> 00:54:00,849
seaso itself is is paramount right if

1356
00:53:58,869 --> 00:54:02,530
I'm thinking something and it's actually

1357
00:54:00,849 --> 00:54:04,089
either invalidated or validated by

1358
00:54:02,530 --> 00:54:05,740
someone else that's a good thing that's

1359
00:54:04,089 --> 00:54:08,470
why these communities need to kind of

1360
00:54:05,740 --> 00:54:10,419
more you know come together and just if

1361
00:54:08,470 --> 00:54:11,529
you're thinking something especially you

1362
00:54:10,420 --> 00:54:13,329
know I'll gut check with some of our

1363
00:54:11,530 --> 00:54:15,400
forensics providers almost every day

1364
00:54:13,329 --> 00:54:16,240
what are you seeing am i thinking about

1365
00:54:15,400 --> 00:54:18,280
this the right way

1366
00:54:16,240 --> 00:54:20,500
and for the most part even though we

1367
00:54:18,280 --> 00:54:22,150
think we are there might be something

1368
00:54:20,500 --> 00:54:24,490
that we're missing so I guess to

1369
00:54:22,150 --> 00:54:26,589
directly answer your question I'm not

1370
00:54:24,490 --> 00:54:30,750
gonna give you details as to the cadence

1371
00:54:26,589 --> 00:54:30,750
but you know on a fairly regular basis

1372
00:54:32,160 --> 00:54:39,790
yeah I think this is gonna be the last

1373
00:54:34,450 --> 00:54:41,910
question because I'm over so going back

1374
00:54:39,790 --> 00:54:46,000
to your presentation on you know pirates

1375
00:54:41,910 --> 00:54:47,770
modern-day pirate the lawyer we have the

1376
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:50,109
California consumer Privacy Act coming

1377
00:54:47,770 --> 00:54:53,290
up and it increases the statutory

1378
00:54:50,109 --> 00:54:54,339
damages for data breaches from a hundred

1379
00:54:53,290 --> 00:54:57,069
to seven hundred fifty dollars per

1380
00:54:54,339 --> 00:54:59,799
person per incident so are the carrier's

1381
00:54:57,069 --> 00:55:01,779
worried that this is going to cause an

1382
00:54:59,799 --> 00:55:04,089
increase in the number of data breach

1383
00:55:01,780 --> 00:55:05,559
class actions filed and corresponding

1384
00:55:04,089 --> 00:55:08,319
increase in the amount of claims being

1385
00:55:05,559 --> 00:55:10,260
brought and is is there any anticipation

1386
00:55:08,319 --> 00:55:12,609
that carriers are going to be auditing

1387
00:55:10,260 --> 00:55:14,349
policyholders to see if the things that

1388
00:55:12,609 --> 00:55:16,690
they say that they're doing they're

1389
00:55:14,349 --> 00:55:20,670
actually doing yeah so I'm the question

1390
00:55:16,690 --> 00:55:23,520
was ultimately associated with CC CPA

1391
00:55:20,670 --> 00:55:27,400
and some and I'm gonna generalize which

1392
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:29,140
and and also ultimately looking at

1393
00:55:27,400 --> 00:55:31,960
enforcement and the expectations that

1394
00:55:29,140 --> 00:55:33,299
CCPA brings with it and any underwriter

1395
00:55:31,960 --> 00:55:35,250
will tell you it's a top

1396
00:55:33,300 --> 00:55:37,740
it's of concern if enforcement actions

1397
00:55:35,250 --> 00:55:39,270
change and I at gdpr I would apply it

1398
00:55:37,740 --> 00:55:40,709
the same way I would apply it to the

1399
00:55:39,270 --> 00:55:42,840
Russian data security law I would apply

1400
00:55:40,710 --> 00:55:45,510
to the Chinese cyber China cybersecurity

1401
00:55:42,840 --> 00:55:46,920
rule all of those things are things that

1402
00:55:45,510 --> 00:55:48,390
we look at from an enforcement

1403
00:55:46,920 --> 00:55:50,610
perspective with some of the fines and

1404
00:55:48,390 --> 00:55:52,620
penalties that we've seen and again I

1405
00:55:50,610 --> 00:55:54,570
think we've all seen in the media it's

1406
00:55:52,620 --> 00:55:56,580
ultimately a question of okay how does

1407
00:55:54,570 --> 00:55:58,470
this change my underwriting and what's

1408
00:55:56,580 --> 00:56:00,740
next on the horizon the you know again

1409
00:55:58,470 --> 00:56:03,120
the emerging risks aren't just

1410
00:56:00,740 --> 00:56:05,729
technology the emerging risks oftentimes

1411
00:56:03,120 --> 00:56:07,560
are actually the litigation the the

1412
00:56:05,730 --> 00:56:12,090
regulation the enforcement of that

1413
00:56:07,560 --> 00:56:13,590
regulation so it's a concern now do I

1414
00:56:12,090 --> 00:56:15,510
think that the underwriting community is

1415
00:56:13,590 --> 00:56:18,030
underwriting specifically to certain

1416
00:56:15,510 --> 00:56:18,420
elements of CCPA I'd say it runs the

1417
00:56:18,030 --> 00:56:20,670
gamut

1418
00:56:18,420 --> 00:56:24,000
right so the 700 insurers some might not

1419
00:56:20,670 --> 00:56:25,230
care you know if again if you're if

1420
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:27,240
you're focused on a large enterprise

1421
00:56:25,230 --> 00:56:29,460
customer with a significant limit that's

1422
00:56:27,240 --> 00:56:31,709
definitely gonna be of topic and it

1423
00:56:29,460 --> 00:56:33,900
needs to be and for the most part that

1424
00:56:31,710 --> 00:56:36,720
bar we're also serving to kind of

1425
00:56:33,900 --> 00:56:39,270
educate the lower and I'll say scale or

1426
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:40,709
SME customers on this is a regulation

1427
00:56:39,270 --> 00:56:42,780
that you absolutely need to understand

1428
00:56:40,710 --> 00:56:45,060
and know about and for the most part

1429
00:56:42,780 --> 00:56:47,220
they at this point unfortunately don't

1430
00:56:45,060 --> 00:56:49,710
and that's where the insurance community

1431
00:56:47,220 --> 00:56:51,240
actually can bring bring that up which

1432
00:56:49,710 --> 00:56:55,860
we've done in other kind of lines in

1433
00:56:51,240 --> 00:56:58,830
insurance all right thanks for your time

1434
00:56:55,860 --> 00:57:02,560
and enjoy black hat

1435
00:56:58,830 --> 00:57:02,560
[Applause]
