I'm going to bring Jeremiah Grossman up

18
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:51,779
onto the stage to introduce the summit

19
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:53,730
for you hi everybody thank you for

20
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:54,960
coming to the cyber insurance summits

21
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:58,169
the first time I've ever done something

22
00:00:54,960 --> 00:01:00,780
like this I've been coming to blackhat

23
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:02,430
since 2002 so usually bring an old

24
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:04,500
technical content and things like that

25
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:07,860
so bring a subject like cyber insurance

26
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:11,400
seems really out of place but how this

27
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:13,680
came about was in 2016 I gave a

28
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:15,360
controversial talk on cyber insurance

29
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:17,250
and security warranties I saw where

30
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:18,990
insurance was moving moving into our

31
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:20,340
space and after talked with a lot of

32
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:23,310
people I was gonna have a profound

33
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:25,049
impact on every single one of us on

34
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:26,430
every single thing that we do in the

35
00:01:25,049 --> 00:01:28,829
entire industry and I didn't know a lot

36
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:30,540
about it and I wanted to learn all about

37
00:01:28,829 --> 00:01:33,449
especially if it can affect our industry

38
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:34,860
so I started hosting the cyber insurance

39
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:37,350
breakfasts in the morning on Wednesday

40
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:39,299
at blackhat and people came and then

41
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:40,829
more people came and frankly I got too

42
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:42,630
big for a breakfast and so I talked with

43
00:01:40,829 --> 00:01:43,949
the blackhat organizers who said because

44
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:45,720
there's a lot of demand for this and

45
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:47,700
then you all showed up here to help make

46
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:50,759
this successful for us for so thank you

47
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:52,439
very much for that for coming I know the

48
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:54,479
subject is controversial a lot of people

49
00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:56,070
have concerns you know very valid

50
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:59,729
concerns about insurance invading our

51
00:01:56,070 --> 00:02:01,169
space bring your questions to us we have

52
00:01:59,729 --> 00:02:02,610
three of the best speakers we could

53
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:03,930
possibly get for us here I want to

54
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:06,299
introduce them and not waste any more

55
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:08,160
time I'm gonna call up in a min a

56
00:02:06,299 --> 00:02:09,399
Jeffrey Smith will be our first speaker

57
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,899
so we're gonna

58
00:02:09,399 --> 00:02:13,480
three presentations separated by a

59
00:02:10,899 --> 00:02:14,470
20-minute gap they'll build in some time

60
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:15,909
for questions at the end of

61
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:17,739
presentations if that's not enough time

62
00:02:15,909 --> 00:02:19,420
these guys will be around to answer more

63
00:02:17,739 --> 00:02:20,680
questions in the hallway track and

64
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:22,000
things like that so please do ask

65
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:24,760
questions that's what we're here for

66
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,310
we're here to learn so the first end I'm

67
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:29,108
not going to call to the stage now is a

68
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:32,170
quite literally my go to cyber insurance

69
00:02:29,109 --> 00:02:33,970
broker he's been doing insurance for 15

70
00:02:32,170 --> 00:02:36,970
20 years something like that a long long

71
00:02:33,970 --> 00:02:38,650
time and now has moved into cyber so he

72
00:02:36,970 --> 00:02:40,780
gets the broker perspective and how to

73
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:43,030
think about these particular things so

74
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:44,889
we're very fortunate to have him the

75
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:46,209
second speaker which will come up in a

76
00:02:44,889 --> 00:02:47,829
second it would be Jake Koontz he's

77
00:02:46,209 --> 00:02:50,200
quite literally one of us he's been an

78
00:02:47,829 --> 00:02:52,480
InfoSec a long long time he's going to

79
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:57,250
show you how cyber insurance fits and

80
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:59,560
impacts your your cybersecurity program

81
00:02:57,250 --> 00:03:02,079
in general and then following that we

82
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:04,180
are gonna have Matt provoke Lansing

83
00:03:02,079 --> 00:03:06,430
incorrectly he's from Chuck he's an

84
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:08,200
actual underwriter an actual carrier who

85
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:10,000
writes these policies for a living and

86
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:11,950
is one of the biggest if not the biggest

87
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,209
carrier in this space that we have so

88
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:15,369
we're very fortunate these people here

89
00:03:13,209 --> 00:03:16,690
to teach us the things that they know so

90
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:20,069
with that I had Jeffrey come on stage

91
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:20,069
and do it 101 talk for us

92
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:31,340
thanks a lot so how long y'all been

93
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:34,549
doing this the black odd thing gerrae so

94
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:35,930
what's that going on 20 years and you

95
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:40,550
just finally thought to invite the

96
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:42,770
insurance guys right so it's not lost to

97
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:47,510
me that our arrival coincides with the

98
00:03:42,770 --> 00:03:50,300
insect invasion I'll try not to read too

99
00:03:47,510 --> 00:03:51,890
much into that Jared thank you and thank

100
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:53,920
you black hat for giving us this great

101
00:03:51,890 --> 00:03:58,250
opportunity to speak to you and and

102
00:03:53,920 --> 00:04:00,200
introduce cyber insurance to you I want

103
00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:03,980
to sort with some observations I first

104
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:05,238
came to blackhat three years ago and I

105
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:08,920
immediately noticed some really striking

106
00:04:05,239 --> 00:04:12,410
differences between security world and

107
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:14,630
the insurance universe first of all your

108
00:04:12,410 --> 00:04:17,750
stories are absolutely fascinating to me

109
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:20,858
I mean while I was reading insurance

110
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:24,560
policies and reviewing claims and

111
00:04:20,858 --> 00:04:28,729
developing lost scenarios you guys were

112
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:30,440
hacking into AOL chat rooms climbing

113
00:04:28,729 --> 00:04:33,830
telephone poles to eavesdrop on your

114
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:36,380
neighbors conversations all the while

115
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:38,960
who knew a lot more fun than me and I

116
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:41,060
find the folks I've met here a lot more

117
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:46,159
interesting than the folks I I encounter

118
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:48,200
of day and insurance it's a low bar so

119
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:50,330
uh even when I look at the attendee list

120
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:52,370
you know here I see PhDs

121
00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:55,510
I see data scientists I see

122
00:04:52,370 --> 00:04:58,610
mathematicians I saw dude from the CIA

123
00:04:55,510 --> 00:05:00,800
there are unicorns here we certainly

124
00:04:58,610 --> 00:05:05,050
don't have unicorns in insurance we

125
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:07,370
don't have Sherpas we don't have Angeles

126
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:10,880
and we sure don't have thought

127
00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:12,560
capitalists like it'd you not I had one

128
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:14,870
guy one of these shows introduced me to

129
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:17,570
him he handed me card and it said

130
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:22,160
thought capitalist I didn't know what it

131
00:05:17,570 --> 00:05:25,550
was I figured he was just stoned you

132
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:30,890
guys got cool nicknames right death

133
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:32,960
veggie and mudge and our snake we don't

134
00:05:30,890 --> 00:05:34,099
we don't have any cool nicknames in our

135
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:35,090
space I mean who'd you rather have a

136
00:05:34,099 --> 00:05:39,760
beer with

137
00:05:35,090 --> 00:05:43,219
veggie or or Baba casually actuary

138
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:46,610
pretty simple pretty simple choice we

139
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:51,169
have no cool clubs you guys have what is

140
00:05:46,610 --> 00:05:54,160
it cult of the call to the dead cow we

141
00:05:51,169 --> 00:05:56,030
have plus professional liabilities

142
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:58,820
professional liability underwriting

143
00:05:56,030 --> 00:06:01,400
Society and you know we do it our

144
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:03,800
conventions I mean you guys break things

145
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:06,739
your conventions you know you guys like

146
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:10,930
one of the first invites I got was from

147
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:13,490
Jeremiah for his Brazilian Jujitsu

148
00:06:10,930 --> 00:06:16,910
Smackdown so you guys break things you

149
00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:18,590
break each other right and then and then

150
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:20,419
you go over to Def Con and you hacked

151
00:06:18,590 --> 00:06:23,929
everything that's got a chip in it it's

152
00:06:20,419 --> 00:06:28,599
really cool it's really cool at our

153
00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:34,550
conventions I guess what we do we drink

154
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:37,910
and we drink a lot so the other thing I

155
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:41,169
noticed differences the other thing I

156
00:06:37,910 --> 00:06:45,260
noticed was that Ely walking around the

157
00:06:41,169 --> 00:06:47,030
the expo floor was that the way we do

158
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:48,979
things the way we pitch our products is

159
00:06:47,030 --> 00:06:51,710
we put everything through I'll say the

160
00:06:48,979 --> 00:06:53,510
actual Iser so we feed a bunch of data

161
00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:55,580
into the actuary department and then

162
00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:57,020
they spit out rates for us and then we

163
00:06:55,580 --> 00:07:03,430
pitch it based upon a here's your

164
00:06:57,020 --> 00:07:03,430
exposure blah you guys use an awful Iser

165
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:10,849
seriously you guys use an awful Iser you

166
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:12,560
guys use sex and you guys use return on

167
00:07:10,849 --> 00:07:15,349
investment which I'm I don't quite

168
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:18,800
understand how it works

169
00:07:15,349 --> 00:07:21,860
who knew that protecting your endpoints

170
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:24,050
could be so sexy not me

171
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:25,460
all joking aside I love this stuff I

172
00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:27,110
love cyber insurance it's like the

173
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:30,080
coolest thing to come around the

174
00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:32,990
insurance space like in forever and I'm

175
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:37,760
really happy to be here when I first got

176
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:41,150
into cyber insurance the product I found

177
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:44,390
was poorly portrayed both in utility and

178
00:07:41,150 --> 00:07:47,270
in content and the typical the typical

179
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:48,020
cell situation would be a fire insurance

180
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:49,669
or prop

181
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:51,799
KAV insurance agent because that's where

182
00:07:49,669 --> 00:07:55,400
we distribute product sitting with the

183
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:56,659
CFO of a large company saying the CFO

184
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:58,909
hey hears about your fire insurance

185
00:07:56,659 --> 00:08:02,300
renewal we did a great job and oh by the

186
00:07:58,909 --> 00:08:05,449
way my boss said I got to show you this

187
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:06,199
other thing what is it called cyber

188
00:08:05,449 --> 00:08:08,530
insurance

189
00:08:06,199 --> 00:08:10,520
what's my exposure how much does it cost

190
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:12,679
you know the agents don't understand

191
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:15,650
this stuff so the response would be

192
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:19,129
anthem Target Home Depot OMB

193
00:08:15,650 --> 00:08:20,659
did you see 60 minutes and you know CFO

194
00:08:19,129 --> 00:08:23,569
is not going to buy CFO's can't relate

195
00:08:20,659 --> 00:08:26,270
to that so there was no cell there was

196
00:08:23,569 --> 00:08:29,120
no traction and more importantly that

197
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:32,750
that business was not any better

198
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:34,190
prepared or any better protected from a

199
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:40,450
cyber as they were before he walked in

200
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:40,450
the door so in terms of other insurance

201
00:08:40,539 --> 00:08:44,420
the way other insurance is is

202
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:46,699
underwritten as I mentioned before we

203
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:48,199
actualize everything so and on any given

204
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:52,130
risk let's say to workers compensation

205
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:53,810
risk on large companies we may have a

206
00:08:52,130 --> 00:08:57,500
hundred thousand claim files for that

207
00:08:53,810 --> 00:08:59,359
company to to develop and come up with

208
00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:02,060
rates and so we end up with a really

209
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:04,160
tight rate with that many losses on top

210
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:07,069
of that actually the actors will have

211
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:10,189
access to a millions of files through

212
00:09:07,070 --> 00:09:12,860
through aggregators and they further use

213
00:09:10,190 --> 00:09:14,690
that to develop claims so good examples

214
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:19,820
let's talk about a large nursing home

215
00:09:14,690 --> 00:09:22,880
chain I can tell you that for every

216
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:25,700
hundred dollars of payroll you're gonna

217
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:26,870
pay two dollars in claims further I can

218
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:28,520
tell you you're gonna have a hundred and

219
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:33,740
ten one hundred fifteen claims a year I

220
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:37,399
can tell you that 80% your claims going

221
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:39,440
to be under $1,500 I can tell you 50% or

222
00:09:37,399 --> 00:09:41,420
60% of your severity meaning the

223
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:43,820
aggregate claims payouts are gonna be

224
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:45,680
due to back strings I can tell you that

225
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:47,060
the other 20% is going to be due or 40%

226
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:49,310
is going to be due to needle sticks I

227
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:50,329
can tell you all this when we underwrite

228
00:09:49,310 --> 00:09:51,829
a worker's comp risk

229
00:09:50,329 --> 00:09:58,130
I can also tell you in a nursing home

230
00:09:51,829 --> 00:09:59,589
risk if you use mechanical lifts to lift

231
00:09:58,130 --> 00:10:01,340
residents instead of lifting them

232
00:09:59,589 --> 00:10:04,100
individually we

233
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:07,100
cut your rate by 45% because we have

234
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:08,570
data on that that's not the case in

235
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:11,600
cyber insurance because it's a new and

236
00:10:08,570 --> 00:10:13,970
evolving product we don't have M

237
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:15,020
credible X world data we claimed you're

238
00:10:13,970 --> 00:10:17,630
starting to happen we're going to talk

239
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:22,370
about that in detail but we don't have

240
00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:25,790
that and so why did it come to blackhat

241
00:10:22,370 --> 00:10:27,100
I came to blackhat the first first time

242
00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:29,810
three years ago I think I mentioned that

243
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:31,370
and the idea was I wants to be able to

244
00:10:29,810 --> 00:10:34,550
better position our product so I want to

245
00:10:31,370 --> 00:10:36,980
be able to give my agent wrist specific

246
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:39,020
stuff so that he could better connect

247
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:41,180
with the CFO and better explain his

248
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:43,189
exposures maybe provide some

249
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:44,989
recommendations and so the CFO to

250
00:10:43,190 --> 00:10:52,430
actually see the value proposition and

251
00:10:44,990 --> 00:10:53,810
and we close more deals I met by the

252
00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:57,439
pleasure of meeting Jeremih Grossman a

253
00:10:53,810 --> 00:10:58,969
guy named Robert Hanson and they badly

254
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:00,920
enough or fascinated with insurance

255
00:10:58,970 --> 00:11:02,330
jeremiad been in the warranty space for

256
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:05,959
a while and they agreed to be the

257
00:11:02,330 --> 00:11:08,540
advisors for my company so shortly

258
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:10,580
thereafter I get a submission on my desk

259
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:14,390
somebody wanted a quote a cyber quote

260
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:18,950
and it was for a travel tech company a

261
00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:20,150
technology company at api's and I didn't

262
00:11:18,950 --> 00:11:22,070
really understand the risk so I called

263
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:23,510
Robert I said Robert can you take a look

264
00:11:22,070 --> 00:11:29,180
at this for me I don't understand it

265
00:11:23,510 --> 00:11:45,250
tell me what to find out so sorry I lost

266
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:45,250
my slides no words

267
00:11:54,800 --> 00:12:05,370
we're back sorry about that

268
00:12:00,650 --> 00:12:08,579
anyhow so I tell Robert that you know

269
00:12:05,370 --> 00:12:11,070
this this agent had been trying to win

270
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:12,450
this account for three years and he was

271
00:12:11,070 --> 00:12:13,470
trying to win the whole you know he

272
00:12:12,450 --> 00:12:15,510
wanted to win the whole business

273
00:12:13,470 --> 00:12:16,800
insurance portfolio for this company and

274
00:12:15,510 --> 00:12:18,150
he was really frustrated because this

275
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:19,920
account not only did they not buy cyber

276
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:21,449
insurance they didn't buy technology

277
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:23,280
errors and omissions insurance and this

278
00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:27,840
was a fifty sixty million dollar company

279
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:30,839
so it's pretty significant so Robert

280
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:34,650
calls me says Jeffrey don't write this

281
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:35,940
one with your money and I said well

282
00:12:34,650 --> 00:12:38,939
Robert first I don't write anything with

283
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:41,340
my money and and second send me an email

284
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:46,010
tell me tell me what's up with it so

285
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:46,010
Robert this is email I get from Robert

286
00:12:46,130 --> 00:12:50,220
Robert says there's a lot wrong with

287
00:12:48,030 --> 00:12:53,220
this company dude laughs out loud

288
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:55,920
no HTTP we talked about that before but

289
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:56,760
on key forms I'm amazed their customers

290
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:59,219
haven't complained

291
00:12:56,760 --> 00:13:01,500
Krum will actually block this stuff now

292
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:03,600
not to mention Google will degrade their

293
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:05,340
page rank that's possibly a good thing

294
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:09,690
from a security perspective actually

295
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:11,390
less people will find in hack them and

296
00:13:09,690 --> 00:13:14,730
then he talked about the one password

297
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:16,410
more importantly what was crazy is that

298
00:13:14,730 --> 00:13:17,910
Robert took me to one of the landing

299
00:13:16,410 --> 00:13:20,510
pages for this company it was actually

300
00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:22,980
the page where their customers log in

301
00:13:20,510 --> 00:13:24,569
and he drew my attention to the bottom

302
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:26,430
and they're a bunch of Chinese symbols

303
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:28,860
in a link at the bottom of the page and

304
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:29,520
I clicked on it and it took me to the

305
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:31,260
Chinese government

306
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:34,980
it looked like a chinese government

307
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:37,950
website so i called the agent and i said

308
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:39,150
get the CEO and CFO on the phone so we

309
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:39,900
get them on the phone and my first

310
00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:41,939
question is

311
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:45,510
so are you guys arranging travel for the

312
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:48,060
chinese government and there's dead

313
00:13:45,510 --> 00:13:51,710
silence and then the response was kind

314
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:53,910
of like what you talked about willis and

315
00:13:51,710 --> 00:13:57,210
so to make a long story short they

316
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:59,640
called people like you we cleaned up the

317
00:13:57,210 --> 00:14:01,200
risk and you know the agent we put

318
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:03,390
together a product for them that worked

319
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:04,019
for them techno and a cyber policy and

320
00:14:03,390 --> 00:14:09,809
there

321
00:14:04,019 --> 00:14:11,910
the customer today the key takeaways

322
00:14:09,809 --> 00:14:13,920
there ideally what I'd like for you to

323
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:16,529
walk away with is some understanding of

324
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:19,679
cyber insurance and how it works and you

325
00:14:16,529 --> 00:14:21,779
know not unlike your space we get we get

326
00:14:19,679 --> 00:14:23,309
beat up a lot I'm gonna talk about some

327
00:14:21,779 --> 00:14:25,079
common ground I mean we're on the same

328
00:14:23,309 --> 00:14:28,199
business I believe what the value

329
00:14:25,079 --> 00:14:29,519
proposition is what's included and talk

330
00:14:28,199 --> 00:14:32,008
a little bit about calculating claim

331
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:33,540
cost as we see them and then a little

332
00:14:32,009 --> 00:14:35,429
bit on market Intel because these guys

333
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:39,920
are gonna cover that and a lot of these

334
00:14:35,429 --> 00:14:48,660
in more detail in the upcoming sessions

335
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:50,009
so do you guys get this a lot cyber

336
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:52,579
insurance are InfoSec it's scaring

337
00:14:50,009 --> 00:14:55,019
confusing but at least it's boring and

338
00:14:52,579 --> 00:14:57,479
you know that's not an uncommon sort of

339
00:14:55,019 --> 00:14:59,069
response so you know CFO say oh my god I

340
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:01,559
saw some of the news or one of my pals

341
00:14:59,069 --> 00:15:02,488
got you know hacked get out here you

342
00:15:01,559 --> 00:15:04,439
know come talk to us about that

343
00:15:02,489 --> 00:15:05,730
insurance stuff and then we get out

344
00:15:04,439 --> 00:15:07,319
there and they're like wow you know 10

345
00:15:05,730 --> 00:15:12,290
minutes and they go I this is confusing

346
00:15:07,319 --> 00:15:14,939
and now I just want you to leave so

347
00:15:12,290 --> 00:15:17,099
we're kind of the same boat in that

348
00:15:14,939 --> 00:15:19,469
respects I think some of y'all recognize

349
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:22,189
these guys it's like last time I saw you

350
00:15:19,470 --> 00:15:23,730
I gave you more money for security

351
00:15:22,189 --> 00:15:27,868
you've been hacked

352
00:15:23,730 --> 00:15:31,799
so this slide to me is about efficacy we

353
00:15:27,869 --> 00:15:33,869
both share the problem of perception of

354
00:15:31,799 --> 00:15:36,929
the efficacy of our products and that's

355
00:15:33,869 --> 00:15:40,559
a big common thread and so basically

356
00:15:36,929 --> 00:15:42,980
we're in the same business so what's the

357
00:15:40,559 --> 00:15:46,829
value proposition of cyber insurance

358
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:47,850
first as an outside perspective so we'll

359
00:15:46,829 --> 00:15:51,059
talk a little bit about evolving

360
00:15:47,850 --> 00:15:52,889
services in front-end evaluation

361
00:15:51,059 --> 00:15:55,049
services in a second but it's a fresh

362
00:15:52,889 --> 00:15:57,600
look under the hood and possibly be a

363
00:15:55,049 --> 00:15:59,669
stamp of approval or identify some

364
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:03,299
things that that maybe can improve at

365
00:15:59,669 --> 00:16:06,569
the risk then you talk about immediate

366
00:16:03,299 --> 00:16:08,759
support so the question here is and this

367
00:16:06,569 --> 00:16:10,829
is probably my view on the most valuable

368
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:12,509
aspect of these products and what

369
00:16:10,829 --> 00:16:15,660
differentiates them from other insurance

370
00:16:12,509 --> 00:16:17,460
products is it who are you gonna call do

371
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:20,510
you know PR people

372
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:23,870
or our lawyers who specialized in cyber

373
00:16:20,510 --> 00:16:26,460
response do you have on your speed dial

374
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:30,720
comes with the product all these people

375
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:33,600
are vetted financial recovery reputation

376
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:35,459
management and lost income or you know

377
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:36,060
downtime and then getting back to

378
00:16:35,459 --> 00:16:38,069
business

379
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:40,050
so the product will also deal with the

380
00:16:38,070 --> 00:16:43,050
litigation that you may face after the

381
00:16:40,050 --> 00:16:49,589
fact work with you on on repairing any

382
00:16:43,050 --> 00:16:51,750
reputation Alysha what is it it's an

383
00:16:49,589 --> 00:16:53,550
insurance contract it's it's like any

384
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:54,720
other insurance contract it looks like

385
00:16:53,550 --> 00:16:56,430
every other insurance contract is

386
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:59,870
written like most other insurance

387
00:16:56,430 --> 00:17:03,599
contracts the product is is new

388
00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:07,050
relatively speaking the product is

389
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:08,849
either probably 50% of the market the

390
00:17:07,050 --> 00:17:11,069
insurance is provided in other insurance

391
00:17:08,849 --> 00:17:13,079
so that can be a business owners policy

392
00:17:11,069 --> 00:17:15,869
it could be a crime policy you can have

393
00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:17,159
riders malpractice policy it's not

394
00:17:15,869 --> 00:17:19,260
coming for them to have cyber insurance

395
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:20,730
riders the problem with these riders is

396
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:22,500
that the coverage is short so the limits

397
00:17:20,730 --> 00:17:23,849
are typically really short like hundred

398
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:28,079
thousand two hundred thousand dollars

399
00:17:23,849 --> 00:17:30,600
and the coverage kind of sucks so the

400
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:34,440
product is the standalone market which

401
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:36,750
we play in is growing so you know it's

402
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:39,929
it's at some point in the next few years

403
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:45,690
it's gonna surpass the blended market

404
00:17:39,929 --> 00:17:46,800
and I think at some point in time cyber

405
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:48,420
insurance is gonna be part of any

406
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:49,740
standard business insurance portfolio

407
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:52,110
along with property and workers comp

408
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:54,540
internal liability now it's destroyed

409
00:17:52,110 --> 00:17:59,270
you primarily through retail insurance

410
00:17:54,540 --> 00:18:02,580
agents property cow for the agents but

411
00:17:59,270 --> 00:18:04,290
we think there's some ways to distribute

412
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:06,510
what we call access Insurance capacity

413
00:18:04,290 --> 00:18:10,010
that means we have more oranges to sell

414
00:18:06,510 --> 00:18:13,890
than people buying through through

415
00:18:10,010 --> 00:18:17,040
security warranties and distribute

416
00:18:13,890 --> 00:18:18,380
through the MSSP Channel we'll talk

417
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:22,309
about that

418
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:25,669
so security product warranties less than

419
00:18:22,309 --> 00:18:27,260
1% of the security software vendors buy

420
00:18:25,669 --> 00:18:30,650
or actually stand behind their product

421
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:32,720
in any sort of form or fashion a lot of

422
00:18:30,650 --> 00:18:34,789
them particularly the smaller ones who

423
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:36,470
have great products they may not have

424
00:18:34,789 --> 00:18:38,629
adequate areas and missions or

425
00:18:36,470 --> 00:18:40,490
professional liability insurance to

426
00:18:38,630 --> 00:18:44,030
cover them because if they're not

427
00:18:40,490 --> 00:18:45,500
warranting their product you know if you

428
00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:46,789
take you can't if you're in a virus

429
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:48,980
don't work you can't take it back to the

430
00:18:46,789 --> 00:18:50,150
man who sold it to you and said here

431
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:52,850
giving them a money back and make me

432
00:18:50,150 --> 00:18:54,830
whole you have to sue them to get whole

433
00:18:52,850 --> 00:18:58,459
and that's what a technology errors and

434
00:18:54,830 --> 00:19:00,889
omissions insurance policy does now for

435
00:18:58,460 --> 00:19:03,169
more information on the warranties we

436
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:04,669
set up a website and we track them so

437
00:19:03,169 --> 00:19:07,400
you go to the website security

438
00:19:04,669 --> 00:19:09,559
warranties calm and check it out

439
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:10,730
in terms of MSSP distribute insurance

440
00:19:09,559 --> 00:19:14,950
this is a fascinating I think

441
00:19:10,730 --> 00:19:17,179
opportunity because we've looked at

442
00:19:14,950 --> 00:19:18,470
situations where MSS piece came to us

443
00:19:17,179 --> 00:19:20,840
and said hey we think we can close more

444
00:19:18,470 --> 00:19:22,429
deals if we embed you know cyber

445
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:25,699
insurance in one of our subscriptions

446
00:19:22,429 --> 00:19:28,280
and so we underwrite these and a good

447
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:29,900
example is we had you know one vendor

448
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:32,780
come to us and said hey all of our gold

449
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:35,480
subscriptions we want to include some

450
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:37,908
cyber insurance and they told me the

451
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:39,679
price point and so we came up with a

452
00:19:37,909 --> 00:19:40,880
product that was a kit Mervyn's quarter

453
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:43,820
million or half million dollars worth of

454
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:45,530
insurance that would be you know baked

455
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:48,110
in the product baked into their

456
00:19:45,530 --> 00:19:49,940
subscription and I think the price is

457
00:19:48,110 --> 00:19:53,299
like under three hundred dollars a year

458
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:55,340
for that insurance so it's like you know

459
00:19:53,299 --> 00:19:56,720
ninety percent of travel insurance is

460
00:19:55,340 --> 00:20:01,070
sold through travel agents because they

461
00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:04,039
understand the risk so I think there's a

462
00:20:01,070 --> 00:20:06,230
great opportunity for this to be offered

463
00:20:04,039 --> 00:20:08,090
as a holistic solution or can be an

464
00:20:06,230 --> 00:20:14,630
opportunity ms ESPYs to say hey we stand

465
00:20:08,090 --> 00:20:16,189
behind our product so the product

466
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:18,320
offering is basically three parts

467
00:20:16,190 --> 00:20:20,630
there's a first-party coverage which is

468
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:22,760
basically pay you back for your stuff

469
00:20:20,630 --> 00:20:23,030
your direct cost in the event of a

470
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:25,309
breach

471
00:20:23,030 --> 00:20:27,080
there's the third-party coverage which

472
00:20:25,309 --> 00:20:28,250
is like liability costs that's lawyers

473
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:29,960
that's when the lawyers get involved

474
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:30,780
when somebody brings an action against

475
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:32,580
you

476
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:35,190
I think the most exciting aspect of the

477
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:39,000
program are the product today is the

478
00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:42,360
evolution of the security products that

479
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:44,280
are offered in in some of these in the

480
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:46,260
new insurance contracts over the last I

481
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:51,030
guess two or three years it's really

482
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:53,850
happening quickly so first part is your

483
00:20:51,030 --> 00:20:57,360
direct expenses so you got event

484
00:20:53,850 --> 00:21:00,629
response cybercrime coverage for

485
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:02,909
downtime and then other stuff so your

486
00:21:00,630 --> 00:21:06,120
event response when you have a claim

487
00:21:02,910 --> 00:21:08,610
you'll call a breach coach or a lot of

488
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:12,810
instances now the first responder could

489
00:21:08,610 --> 00:21:14,790
be a security engineer so the first

490
00:21:12,810 --> 00:21:16,530
responder they'll get a lawyer involved

491
00:21:14,790 --> 00:21:19,740
pretty quick now the large job is to

492
00:21:16,530 --> 00:21:21,899
tell you about what state notifications

493
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:24,060
what statutes you're responsible for

494
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:26,340
what obligations you have to notify if

495
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:29,159
you got a HIPAA issue you know that sort

496
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:31,560
of thing they bring to forensics people

497
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:33,210
in public relations people would get

498
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:36,240
started they'll work up the notification

499
00:21:33,210 --> 00:21:38,700
if they have to send out letters they'll

500
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:43,520
send out the letters they provide credit

501
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:48,690
monitoring as part of these programs

502
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:51,629
cybercrime big deal extortion ransomware

503
00:21:48,690 --> 00:21:54,050
I think and and and Matt will talk more

504
00:21:51,630 --> 00:21:57,450
to this but the two claims we're seeing

505
00:21:54,050 --> 00:22:00,960
with increasing frequency ransomware is

506
00:21:57,450 --> 00:22:03,660
not too surprising but the wire transfer

507
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:05,720
fraud claims were paying or are trending

508
00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:07,920
in a bad direction

509
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:09,360
there's also phishing coverage for

510
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:10,650
phishing like third party phishing they

511
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:14,399
call it some of them call it client

512
00:22:10,650 --> 00:22:15,750
phishing where the client gets fished by

513
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:20,280
somebody looks like you and they send

514
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:22,200
money somewhere telecom fraud in terms

515
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:24,570
of downtime in the insurance industry

516
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:27,120
would call this business interruption so

517
00:22:24,570 --> 00:22:30,060
the idea is to replace your your income

518
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:32,010
and any expenses that continue during a

519
00:22:30,060 --> 00:22:35,100
downtime now there are different

520
00:22:32,010 --> 00:22:37,950
triggers it depends on the trigger so

521
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:41,040
the trigger the most common trigger is a

522
00:22:37,950 --> 00:22:41,550
cyber event or breach that shuts you

523
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:43,409
down

524
00:22:41,550 --> 00:22:44,970
shut you out of your system

525
00:22:43,410 --> 00:22:46,740
or your data that's held in the

526
00:22:44,970 --> 00:22:48,630
third-party system and that's called

527
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:49,490
dependent business interruption then

528
00:22:48,630 --> 00:22:51,720
there's one called

529
00:22:49,490 --> 00:22:53,660
that's there's a there's a business

530
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:55,860
interruption claimants room by system

531
00:22:53,660 --> 00:22:58,260
interruption where it's not a cyber

532
00:22:55,860 --> 00:23:01,979
event but there's an unexpected system

533
00:22:58,260 --> 00:23:03,420
interruption that cost you money now

534
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:06,660
that will cover system interruption but

535
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:10,410
you got a lot of times excuse me

536
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:12,810
with the system interruption sometimes

537
00:23:10,410 --> 00:23:14,340
you need to shut your system down when a

538
00:23:12,810 --> 00:23:16,350
breach happens for a period of time and

539
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:17,760
they'll pick that up too as long as you

540
00:23:16,350 --> 00:23:22,820
call and tell them what you're going to

541
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:25,440
do other stuff hardware we had a claim

542
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:30,510
it was about six months ago it was a

543
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:34,080
regional health care system and that a

544
00:23:30,510 --> 00:23:35,700
big breach turns out that they didn't

545
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:37,139
pay the ransom because they realized in

546
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:40,110
the process that their whole systems

547
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:42,180
need to be rebuilt and all their servers

548
00:23:40,110 --> 00:23:45,689
were bricked so the policy replaced two

549
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:48,780
hundred servers paid for downtime court

550
00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:50,730
attendance reward expenses you know some

551
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:52,740
little sexy bells and whistles picks up

552
00:23:50,730 --> 00:23:55,230
you know crypto jacking someone will

553
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:57,000
include expenses for claims preparation

554
00:23:55,230 --> 00:23:58,230
which is forensic accountants and stuff

555
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:02,850
to come in and calculate what your

556
00:23:58,230 --> 00:24:06,000
business interruption loss is okay

557
00:24:02,850 --> 00:24:09,709
resolving third party claims first party

558
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:12,390
claims are probably I'm told 80% or so

559
00:24:09,710 --> 00:24:14,700
but when you get sued you get sued so

560
00:24:12,390 --> 00:24:18,600
you have security privacy liability

561
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:20,580
so that's defense and damages now I say

562
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:22,860
liability and assumed under contract

563
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:24,570
that's a that's a sticky wicket but

564
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:26,100
sometimes you'll assume liability for

565
00:24:24,570 --> 00:24:27,689
others in a contract as long as they

566
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:29,159
know about it you can figure out a way

567
00:24:27,690 --> 00:24:31,110
to get it covered

568
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:35,730
malware transmission an authorized

569
00:24:31,110 --> 00:24:39,270
release of pH I our PII I will tell you

570
00:24:35,730 --> 00:24:41,340
a quick anecdote the multimedia

571
00:24:39,270 --> 00:24:43,410
liability coverage picks up any

572
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:45,449
unauthorized disclosure so we had

573
00:24:43,410 --> 00:24:47,100
another healthcare there's a lot of

574
00:24:45,450 --> 00:24:50,020
claims in health care space we had

575
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:52,490
another health care customer who

576
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:55,280
one of the employees it's a small small

577
00:24:52,490 --> 00:24:56,990
town and one of the employees went out

578
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:58,399
with drinking beers with a buddy and

579
00:24:56,990 --> 00:24:59,840
decided to share information on the

580
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:02,510
medical file of one of their patients

581
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:05,419
well small town so this woman found out

582
00:25:02,510 --> 00:25:07,850
and she brought an action against them

583
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:09,760
and the policy picked up defense and

584
00:25:07,850 --> 00:25:12,949
damages because it picks up any

585
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:14,570
liability for unauthorized release of

586
00:25:12,950 --> 00:25:16,640
privileged information

587
00:25:14,570 --> 00:25:21,820
raela Tory defense and penalties that's

588
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:24,050
a big deal especially with gdpr PCI DSS

589
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:26,720
assessments fines you know card

590
00:25:24,050 --> 00:25:29,600
reissuance expenses and then multimedia

591
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:33,890
liability you know electronic or written

592
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:39,169
liable slander defamation infringement

593
00:25:33,890 --> 00:25:41,480
or copyrights and and d'like now this is

594
00:25:39,170 --> 00:25:44,810
where things are really happening

595
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:46,910
quickly traditionally the insurance

596
00:25:44,810 --> 00:25:48,350
industry's solution to every problem is

597
00:25:46,910 --> 00:25:50,900
to give you an insurance policy in an

598
00:25:48,350 --> 00:25:53,090
800 number right and early on that's

599
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:56,390
what this policy did um it did provide

600
00:25:53,090 --> 00:25:58,340
the services a lot of services but as

601
00:25:56,390 --> 00:26:00,650
times going by you're starting to see an

602
00:25:58,340 --> 00:26:02,929
evolution in terms of more services now

603
00:26:00,650 --> 00:26:06,920
this is a company called coalition they

604
00:26:02,930 --> 00:26:08,750
got a really interesting a prop first of

605
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:10,850
all they actually include and they write

606
00:26:08,750 --> 00:26:13,250
companies under a half a million dollars

607
00:26:10,850 --> 00:26:16,100
but they actually include apps they do a

608
00:26:13,250 --> 00:26:19,310
risk assessment up front

609
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:21,439
they include apps that hopefully will

610
00:26:19,310 --> 00:26:23,600
keep at least work to keep the insured

611
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:26,770
safe during the policy period claim

612
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:29,719
comes in they get the experts involved

613
00:26:26,770 --> 00:26:31,820
then after they work to mitigate your

614
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:35,000
claim after the fact with public

615
00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:38,210
relations and and what-have-you so this

616
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:40,310
is the trend in in in our space is

617
00:26:38,210 --> 00:26:42,050
they're starting to include security

618
00:26:40,310 --> 00:26:44,480
tools a lot of tools that you guys use

619
00:26:42,050 --> 00:26:45,550
to assess risk and so getting back the

620
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:47,840
insurance agent

621
00:26:45,550 --> 00:26:49,669
this time the interns age goes out and

622
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:51,230
sister the CFO and says hey you know we

623
00:26:49,670 --> 00:26:53,570
did an assessment we found you have a

624
00:26:51,230 --> 00:26:56,630
remote you know you use an unprotected

625
00:26:53,570 --> 00:26:58,460
remote desktop protocol you've got some

626
00:26:56,630 --> 00:27:00,620
servers that aren't behind firewalls

627
00:26:58,460 --> 00:27:02,540
you got some patching issues and the

628
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:03,229
like so it actually gives the agents on

629
00:27:02,540 --> 00:27:08,030
the tangible

630
00:27:03,230 --> 00:27:10,400
to speak to the insured about so maybe

631
00:27:08,030 --> 00:27:12,500
it's better to understand these in terms

632
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:14,660
of the timeline of a claim so you have

633
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:18,200
the breech then you have the breach

634
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:20,410
coach the forensics folks jump in claims

635
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:22,520
they valuate the claims of legitimacy

636
00:27:20,410 --> 00:27:25,250
they'll get involved with electric

637
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:27,168
they'll identify what regulatory and

638
00:27:25,250 --> 00:27:29,150
legal issues you have and then they'll

639
00:27:27,169 --> 00:27:31,610
engage the other resources then in the

640
00:27:29,150 --> 00:27:34,640
near term the near term crisis they'll

641
00:27:31,610 --> 00:27:36,949
notify who needs to be notified they'll

642
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:39,590
provide the credit monitoring the data

643
00:27:36,950 --> 00:27:41,480
recovery comes into play and then the

644
00:27:39,590 --> 00:27:43,370
long-term consequences this is where

645
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:46,280
your your downtime comes into play

646
00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:48,469
and and in lawsuits and again the

647
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:50,720
evolving area is the mitigation tools

648
00:27:48,470 --> 00:27:52,720
and consultation so most of carriers

649
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:54,530
have some some form of training

650
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:56,210
originally just like you get online you

651
00:27:54,530 --> 00:27:57,649
watching videos now there's some more

652
00:27:56,210 --> 00:27:59,480
interactive training that are including

653
00:27:57,650 --> 00:28:01,549
up there including their policy up to

654
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:05,440
certain threshold they're offering

655
00:28:01,549 --> 00:28:08,110
fishing simulations domain protection

656
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:12,380
network monitoring patch monitoring

657
00:28:08,110 --> 00:28:14,540
password apps and then you know security

658
00:28:12,380 --> 00:28:15,650
folks and legal people are on call if

659
00:28:14,540 --> 00:28:20,030
you have questions during the policy

660
00:28:15,650 --> 00:28:22,160
period how much does a claim costs how

661
00:28:20,030 --> 00:28:25,010
much insurance do we need so I'm going

662
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:27,260
to show you two scenarios this scenario

663
00:28:25,010 --> 00:28:32,720
is both scenarios going to use fit on

664
00:28:27,260 --> 00:28:36,110
1.5 million files so this scenario was

665
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:39,440
just PII there was a hack they are not

666
00:28:36,110 --> 00:28:43,549
in California they have not had a hack

667
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:45,799
recently we figured that the the the

668
00:28:43,549 --> 00:28:49,879
system itself was probably of average

669
00:28:45,799 --> 00:28:51,740
complexity in making regional news and

670
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:54,980
the security controls were average now

671
00:28:51,740 --> 00:28:59,000
we peg this claim at about for 354 bucks

672
00:28:54,980 --> 00:29:01,640
per file now a note about information

673
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:03,620
that you hear in our space have any all

674
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:05,120
heard 65 percent of business small

675
00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:08,000
businesses go out of business

676
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:12,620
after a after a hack has anybody heard

677
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:15,630
that stat well Scott this is bullshit

678
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:20,280
and I say that they told me to watch my

679
00:29:15,630 --> 00:29:22,200
language I say that because even the

680
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:23,550
source the alleged source came out and

681
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:25,320
said that's not sure there's no data to

682
00:29:23,550 --> 00:29:28,320
support that now have we seen companies

683
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:30,149
go to small companies go down yeah we

684
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:33,540
saw a company go down in the recent

685
00:29:30,150 --> 00:29:36,690
quest lab hack in quest labs they didn't

686
00:29:33,540 --> 00:29:38,460
get hacked directly they had engaged a

687
00:29:36,690 --> 00:29:40,350
billing vendor which most his labs do

688
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:43,050
the billing vendor engaged a really

689
00:29:40,350 --> 00:29:45,000
small collections agent the collection

690
00:29:43,050 --> 00:29:48,450
agent got hacked and they noodled their

691
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:50,460
way in the collection agent was maybe a

692
00:29:48,450 --> 00:29:51,600
two hundred crate and I I'm not sure

693
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:53,670
this is a hundred percent accurate I

694
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:56,070
think maybe they had a hundred 150

695
00:29:53,670 --> 00:29:57,150
employees pop bankruptcy immediately I

696
00:29:56,070 --> 00:30:02,429
don't know what they had insurance or

697
00:29:57,150 --> 00:30:07,760
not the other data that's out there the

698
00:30:02,430 --> 00:30:07,760
you know I guess the bellwether study is

699
00:30:07,790 --> 00:30:12,600
that says they came out a few years ago

700
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:15,090
and say hey it's 300 olives file for

701
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:16,379
health care and get up 250 file those

702
00:30:15,090 --> 00:30:21,389
sort of things I haven't really seen

703
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:23,670
those numbers I've seen a couple small

704
00:30:21,390 --> 00:30:26,010
insurance you know really small

705
00:30:23,670 --> 00:30:28,800
insurance get hit with under a thousand

706
00:30:26,010 --> 00:30:30,240
files and they got hammered by HIPAA so

707
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:32,159
the cost of those files may be fifteen

708
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:34,170
hundred bucks but I think these numbers

709
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:36,300
are more realistic in terms of what we

710
00:30:34,170 --> 00:30:39,360
see now this risk was in California it

711
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:41,940
was a health care concern and you can

712
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:44,729
see the cost so this one jumped fivefold

713
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:52,140
or maybe actually more than closer to

714
00:30:44,730 --> 00:30:53,760
six fold from the prior example coverage

715
00:30:52,140 --> 00:30:55,310
limitations so it's important to

716
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:57,510
understand that in an insurance policy

717
00:30:55,310 --> 00:31:00,000
your coverage limitations can come in

718
00:30:57,510 --> 00:31:03,890
three areas exclusions but they're also

719
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:08,150
conditions and definitions that can hide

720
00:31:03,890 --> 00:31:08,150
you know coverage limitations

721
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:13,530
the thing about exclusions you know

722
00:31:11,430 --> 00:31:14,940
people think exclusions oh they're gonna

723
00:31:13,530 --> 00:31:16,500
exclude it because they want to or they

724
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:18,690
want to pay a claim there really a

725
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:20,190
finite number of reasons for an

726
00:31:18,690 --> 00:31:22,470
exclusion be an insurance policy

727
00:31:20,190 --> 00:31:23,880
it's either insured somewhere else like

728
00:31:22,470 --> 00:31:25,050
cyber insurance and gun cover workers

729
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:28,340
comp or property or

730
00:31:25,050 --> 00:31:33,090
and officers liability its uninsurable

731
00:31:28,340 --> 00:31:34,800
like war core internet failure and

732
00:31:33,090 --> 00:31:36,840
what-have-you

733
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:38,430
ports against public policy we're not

734
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:40,439
going to pick up you know intentional

735
00:31:38,430 --> 00:31:41,910
crimes or acts we're not going to pick

736
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:43,710
up fines and penalties that are not

737
00:31:41,910 --> 00:31:46,140
insurable by law there are some states

738
00:31:43,710 --> 00:31:48,900
that don't allow punitive team damages

739
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:51,270
to be insured for example and then there

740
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:53,400
other you know there if a claim is filed

741
00:31:51,270 --> 00:31:56,190
if a claim occurred or is filed before

742
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:57,780
the policy period if there are

743
00:31:56,190 --> 00:32:01,650
contractual issues that weren't

744
00:31:57,780 --> 00:32:05,490
addressed at inception betterment means

745
00:32:01,650 --> 00:32:08,430
you know the theory of insurance the

746
00:32:05,490 --> 00:32:10,050
concept of indemnity means that the idea

747
00:32:08,430 --> 00:32:11,370
the concept of insurance is to put you

748
00:32:10,050 --> 00:32:13,980
back in the place that you were before

749
00:32:11,370 --> 00:32:16,770
claim not not improve your your

750
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:18,330
situation but there are some caveats but

751
00:32:16,770 --> 00:32:20,520
you know if you if the new soccer have

752
00:32:18,330 --> 00:32:22,320
to put in is a new version and it's or

753
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:23,820
the servers that you know they're new

754
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:26,100
versions and that's required then the

755
00:32:23,820 --> 00:32:28,290
insurance will pay for that technology

756
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:30,120
errors and omissions if you are tech

757
00:32:28,290 --> 00:32:33,980
company taking you know is generally

758
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:40,620
included in the cyber or vice versa

759
00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:42,690
government orders so now when you get in

760
00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:44,070
conditions and definitions and this is

761
00:32:42,690 --> 00:32:48,180
what I think will be useful to this

762
00:32:44,070 --> 00:32:52,889
group is first of all don't lie on the

763
00:32:48,180 --> 00:32:54,750
application okay just come clean don't

764
00:32:52,890 --> 00:32:57,090
lie on the application because you will

765
00:32:54,750 --> 00:32:59,730
not get paid now there's some companies

766
00:32:57,090 --> 00:33:01,159
that don't don't refer to the

767
00:32:59,730 --> 00:33:03,650
application as a warranty

768
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:05,850
just don't lie on the application

769
00:33:03,650 --> 00:33:07,230
reporting provisions you have certain

770
00:33:05,850 --> 00:33:09,240
duties in the event of a claim and how

771
00:33:07,230 --> 00:33:12,570
you report a claim the timing how you

772
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:16,830
report a claim how you report it to and

773
00:33:12,570 --> 00:33:20,909
the event of a claim we had a I had a

774
00:33:16,830 --> 00:33:25,590
claim it was a about a month ago and it

775
00:33:20,910 --> 00:33:27,660
was a small company they got hacked they

776
00:33:25,590 --> 00:33:29,100
called us and we got security people

777
00:33:27,660 --> 00:33:31,830
involved we did all the things we're

778
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:33,540
supposed to do and when the forensics

779
00:33:31,830 --> 00:33:36,090
people got involved I got a call and

780
00:33:33,540 --> 00:33:40,110
they said hey Brandon tonight

781
00:33:36,090 --> 00:33:41,699
bite the server they had backups so they

782
00:33:40,110 --> 00:33:44,219
said hey this is awesome we have backups

783
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:46,110
and for whatever reason brandon 19 wiped

784
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:47,880
the server well again this is another

785
00:33:46,110 --> 00:33:50,550
health care company and they had hip

786
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:51,630
obligations and the forensics we

787
00:33:50,550 --> 00:33:52,860
couldn't go in there and tell them if

788
00:33:51,630 --> 00:33:56,160
they had a HIPAA violation or not

789
00:33:52,860 --> 00:33:57,330
because it was gone so don't do stuff

790
00:33:56,160 --> 00:34:00,440
like that

791
00:33:57,330 --> 00:34:02,460
you have pretensions and wait periods

792
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:04,230
retentions are easy understand

793
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:07,260
wait periods are different so wait

794
00:34:04,230 --> 00:34:09,570
periods refer to the downtime so you may

795
00:34:07,260 --> 00:34:11,699
have an eight-hour downtime retention

796
00:34:09,570 --> 00:34:16,910
after eight hours downtime the insurance

797
00:34:11,699 --> 00:34:19,109
will respond the state of the market and

798
00:34:16,909 --> 00:34:21,960
my colleagues you're gonna get into a

799
00:34:19,110 --> 00:34:23,520
lot more detail it continues to grow but

800
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:25,139
there are a lot of challenges there's a

801
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:28,219
big concern about systemic risks that

802
00:34:25,139 --> 00:34:31,230
will knock everybody out of the box I

803
00:34:28,219 --> 00:34:32,790
would say Warren Buffett was recently

804
00:34:31,230 --> 00:34:34,590
asked about cyber insurance and his

805
00:34:32,790 --> 00:34:36,090
response was we're gonna rise a little

806
00:34:34,590 --> 00:34:37,260
up as possible because I don't

807
00:34:36,090 --> 00:34:42,150
understand it I don't think anybody

808
00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:43,800
understand it's in terms of cyber

809
00:34:42,150 --> 00:34:46,260
insurance market it's evolving it's

810
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:49,260
super competitive but it makes up only

811
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:51,990
about 1% of all you know business

812
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:53,790
insurance premiums they're 500 I think

813
00:34:51,989 --> 00:34:55,709
Matt was saying over 700 now maybe of

814
00:34:53,790 --> 00:34:57,540
insurance actually providing some type

815
00:34:55,710 --> 00:34:59,280
of cyber insurance but they're really

816
00:34:57,540 --> 00:35:01,650
only in my view only about 20 players

817
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:04,290
who really understand and know how to

818
00:35:01,650 --> 00:35:07,140
assess risk there are two distinct

819
00:35:04,290 --> 00:35:08,520
markets there's an enterprise market and

820
00:35:07,140 --> 00:35:10,650
then there's a small to medium

821
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:12,210
enterprise market the latter is probably

822
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:14,340
under half a billion dollars give or

823
00:35:12,210 --> 00:35:18,060
take depending on on the market or the

824
00:35:14,340 --> 00:35:20,130
insurer the take-up rates are difficult

825
00:35:18,060 --> 00:35:21,900
to measure and there's all different

826
00:35:20,130 --> 00:35:24,870
information it's even difficult for the

827
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:26,490
insurance people like am best who's a

828
00:35:24,870 --> 00:35:29,670
credit rating agency for the insurance

829
00:35:26,490 --> 00:35:33,029
industry to to figure that out but it's

830
00:35:29,670 --> 00:35:35,100
safely it's under 50% in my opinion and

831
00:35:33,030 --> 00:35:38,510
there's an evolution as I mentioned

832
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:39,990
earlier to these insurer techs and so

833
00:35:38,510 --> 00:35:42,000
instead of doing the traditional

834
00:35:39,990 --> 00:35:43,859
underwriting inching you a policy and an

835
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:46,290
800-number they're actually have

836
00:35:43,860 --> 00:35:47,260
platforms where I go on a platform with

837
00:35:46,290 --> 00:35:50,730
one of my care

838
00:35:47,260 --> 00:35:53,500
I can put in six data points and in

839
00:35:50,730 --> 00:35:55,240
seven seconds I get a risk assessment

840
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:56,470
you know it's got acid inventory it's

841
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:59,348
got all the stuff I mentioned earlier

842
00:35:56,470 --> 00:36:02,200
before I get a quotation I get a

843
00:35:59,349 --> 00:36:06,490
specimen policy with all the information

844
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:09,160
in it I can find coverage in seconds and

845
00:36:06,490 --> 00:36:11,680
so they're making it a lot easier and

846
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:13,598
they're adding more security features to

847
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:15,520
the product so I guess you know my

848
00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:19,750
message here is that what I've learned

849
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:23,109
is the more the more we take your stuff

850
00:36:19,750 --> 00:36:26,490
and combine it with our stuff the better

851
00:36:23,109 --> 00:36:31,119
outcomes are going to be enjoyed by our

852
00:36:26,490 --> 00:36:55,270
customers so that's all I got any

853
00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:57,160
questions yes sure yeah yeah so I think

854
00:36:55,270 --> 00:37:01,599
I had that asterisk so the question was

855
00:36:57,160 --> 00:37:04,868
crime versus terrorism and so terrorism

856
00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:06,789
coverage can be insured it there's

857
00:37:04,869 --> 00:37:08,859
there's a lot of gray area I think Matt

858
00:37:06,789 --> 00:37:10,779
can probably speak to this more

859
00:37:08,859 --> 00:37:13,328
specifically than I can but you know

860
00:37:10,779 --> 00:37:15,099
terrorism through tria can be picked up

861
00:37:13,329 --> 00:37:16,359
the definitions you know a lot of the

862
00:37:15,099 --> 00:37:18,789
claims you hear about that weren't

863
00:37:16,359 --> 00:37:20,319
covered like the big ones recently that

864
00:37:18,789 --> 00:37:21,520
are making all the headlines a lot of

865
00:37:20,319 --> 00:37:23,170
times they didn't buy standalone and

866
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:24,609
cyber insurance policy they're trying to

867
00:37:23,170 --> 00:37:27,220
recover from their property insurance

868
00:37:24,609 --> 00:37:33,240
policy but that that is a great question

869
00:37:27,220 --> 00:37:33,240
and it's evolving what's next yes

870
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:55,029
how about cyberwarfare okay the question

871
00:37:52,450 --> 00:37:59,379
was about cyberwarfare now under cyber

872
00:37:55,029 --> 00:38:01,230
policy you know if you get breached you

873
00:37:59,380 --> 00:38:05,019
know generally there's gonna be coverage

874
00:38:01,230 --> 00:38:08,500
if you have a property policy and you

875
00:38:05,019 --> 00:38:10,149
get breached through a cyber cyber war

876
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:12,220
the challenge with this is how do you

877
00:38:10,150 --> 00:38:14,710
define cyber war and again I'm going to

878
00:38:12,220 --> 00:38:17,740
defer to Matt to get into that in a

879
00:38:14,710 --> 00:38:47,769
little more detail for you what's next

880
00:38:17,740 --> 00:38:49,598
yes sir sure so the question was in

881
00:38:47,769 --> 00:38:52,569
terms of the CFO's you buy this stuff

882
00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:54,849
who they go to to help them assess the

883
00:38:52,569 --> 00:38:57,279
risk and explain the risk to the second

884
00:38:54,849 --> 00:39:01,390
question come let me let me talk to the

885
00:38:57,279 --> 00:39:04,779
first question usually there's an IT

886
00:39:01,390 --> 00:39:06,670
person involved and by Jason to talk

887
00:39:04,779 --> 00:39:10,000
about your role and how you can prove

888
00:39:06,670 --> 00:39:13,059
outcomes so I won't steal you know his

889
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:15,910
thunder but usually there's an IT person

890
00:39:13,059 --> 00:39:17,829
we close the deal today and and they had

891
00:39:15,910 --> 00:39:20,140
an outside IT guy and that's who they

892
00:39:17,829 --> 00:39:21,970
wanted to be the contact but usually the

893
00:39:20,140 --> 00:39:23,680
IT people are the ones that sit and

894
00:39:21,970 --> 00:39:25,480
communicate unless they don't have one

895
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:28,930
the smaller companies we get involved

896
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:33,519
and do that second question was in terms

897
00:39:28,930 --> 00:39:38,828
of the black box is there a black box

898
00:39:33,519 --> 00:39:40,598
Matt yeah so there aren't a lot claims

899
00:39:38,829 --> 00:39:42,819
and so I hate to say and Jeremiah said

900
00:39:40,599 --> 00:39:44,890
this before it's a land grab everybody

901
00:39:42,819 --> 00:39:46,870
feels like they need me in the space so

902
00:39:44,890 --> 00:39:48,850
it's a land grab

903
00:39:46,870 --> 00:39:51,190
most companies in my view they they

904
00:39:48,850 --> 00:39:52,779
don't know what they have there's a lot

905
00:39:51,190 --> 00:39:54,370
of people there's a lot of competition I

906
00:39:52,780 --> 00:39:59,080
think they have a very valuable product

907
00:39:54,370 --> 00:40:01,089
that it's evolving but I think the

908
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:03,279
larger you go when you start getting

909
00:40:01,090 --> 00:40:04,750
into large enterprises they're starting

910
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:06,280
to understand exposures that's the

911
00:40:04,750 --> 00:40:09,820
challenges they're not understanding it

912
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:11,920
from a actual perspective because the

913
00:40:09,820 --> 00:40:14,290
data is just not there it's coming but

914
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:16,720
it's just not there so they're starting

915
00:40:14,290 --> 00:40:18,670
to look into efficacy of certain

916
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:22,299
software tools again the problem though

917
00:40:18,670 --> 00:40:26,710
is unlike static risk like fire workers

918
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:28,660
slip and falls this risk of alts so I'm

919
00:40:26,710 --> 00:40:30,670
not so certain that if we have a bunch

920
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:32,710
actuarial data that is certainly it's

921
00:40:30,670 --> 00:40:34,990
gonna be helpful for sure I don't think

922
00:40:32,710 --> 00:40:38,350
it's going to have the value that you

923
00:40:34,990 --> 00:41:07,990
know the static risk lost data affords

924
00:40:38,350 --> 00:41:10,600
yes sir the question was are there

925
00:41:07,990 --> 00:41:13,870
security measures that the CFO needs to

926
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:16,330
know about - to generate I guess the

927
00:41:13,870 --> 00:41:19,120
best you know insurance outcome the

928
00:41:16,330 --> 00:41:20,529
answer is yes and again I defer to Matt

929
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:22,180
and Jake but they're going to get into

930
00:41:20,530 --> 00:41:25,410
the underwriting the technical aspects

931
00:41:22,180 --> 00:41:27,520
of underwriting but from my perspective

932
00:41:25,410 --> 00:41:29,290
historically carriers have sent you this

933
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:30,790
five or ten page app and you're checking

934
00:41:29,290 --> 00:41:33,730
a bunch of boxes that quite frankly

935
00:41:30,790 --> 00:41:35,320
don't matter you know how we get it we

936
00:41:33,730 --> 00:41:37,000
get a hard time for you know whether we

937
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:38,410
pay or not you know y'all get a hard

938
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:42,640
time because you know you ain't a virus

939
00:41:38,410 --> 00:41:47,009
and firewalls you know they don't always

940
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:52,350
work am i right Jeremiah

941
00:41:47,010 --> 00:41:55,650
so yeah so so the the top ones that we

942
00:41:52,350 --> 00:41:57,890
see at least in my space are two-factor

943
00:41:55,650 --> 00:41:57,890
authentication

944
00:41:58,070 --> 00:42:02,730
administrative privileges if you're sent

945
00:42:01,410 --> 00:42:03,839
in a wire just pick up the phone and

946
00:42:02,730 --> 00:42:05,940
call the person who's getting the wire

947
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:07,890
you know so there there's some of those

948
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:09,750
that you know block and tackling that

949
00:42:07,890 --> 00:42:10,830
are pretty obvious but the engineers are

950
00:42:09,750 --> 00:42:11,730
getting smarter about that they're

951
00:42:10,830 --> 00:42:13,740
actually you know they're running these

952
00:42:11,730 --> 00:42:32,030
passive scans now and there are the

953
00:42:13,740 --> 00:42:32,029
right based upon those scans yes sir I

954
00:42:34,550 --> 00:42:39,570
think the question was is you know about

955
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:41,400
ransom coverage and if I heard you

956
00:42:39,570 --> 00:42:44,160
correctly what I think I heard you say

957
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:48,869
is is there what's the how do they make

958
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:50,490
the decision as to whether yeah oh yeah

959
00:42:48,869 --> 00:42:52,320
yeah yeah now the ransom payments and

960
00:42:50,490 --> 00:42:54,479
the negotiations and the experts and all

961
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:56,430
that including the policy and what's

962
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:59,640
interesting about those two claims is

963
00:42:56,430 --> 00:43:01,618
the amount because heretofore yeah the

964
00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:03,629
amounts were insane right I live in to

965
00:43:01,619 --> 00:43:06,240
Atlanta so we had Jackson County well I

966
00:43:03,630 --> 00:43:08,700
mean we had Atlanta right we had Jackson

967
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:14,430
County Georgia you know under 50

968
00:43:08,700 --> 00:43:16,200
thousand population paid 400 grand you

969
00:43:14,430 --> 00:43:17,460
had the two towns in Florida paid four

970
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:20,250
hundred and six hundred thousand dollars

971
00:43:17,460 --> 00:43:22,800
they're insured and how to make

972
00:43:20,250 --> 00:43:25,140
decisions you know it's funny because a

973
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:26,550
lot of companies are really they just

974
00:43:25,140 --> 00:43:27,990
don't want to pay you know they'll get

975
00:43:26,550 --> 00:43:30,750
the FBI in there and they'll say yeah we

976
00:43:27,990 --> 00:43:33,330
recommend you don't pay the problem is

977
00:43:30,750 --> 00:43:36,420
you know if you have a backup and they

978
00:43:33,330 --> 00:43:38,190
didn't get to that to you know that can

979
00:43:36,420 --> 00:43:41,060
be a great decision but a lot of times

980
00:43:38,190 --> 00:43:43,350
that's not there and as you guys know

981
00:43:41,060 --> 00:43:46,100
the efficacy of a lot of systems out

982
00:43:43,350 --> 00:43:50,250
there leave a lot to be desired

983
00:43:46,100 --> 00:43:52,650
yeah okay I think that's about it for

984
00:43:50,250 --> 00:43:53,970
questions I think I'm out of time I'm

985
00:43:52,650 --> 00:43:55,530
gonna be head it to a meeting room so if

986
00:43:53,970 --> 00:43:57,359
you guys got more questions I'm happy to
