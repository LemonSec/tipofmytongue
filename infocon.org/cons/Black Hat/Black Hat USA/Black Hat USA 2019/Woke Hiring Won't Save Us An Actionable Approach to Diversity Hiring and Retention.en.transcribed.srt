1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,339
you're an Islander FG and welcome to

2
00:00:02,669 --> 00:00:07,080
awoke hiring won't save us an actionable

3
00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:10,679
approach to diversity hiring and

4
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:12,240
retention with Becca Lynch while you're

5
00:00:10,679 --> 00:00:13,519
here today please stop by the business

6
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:16,440
hall in Mandalay Bay

7
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:18,230
Oceanside and shoreline ballrooms the

8
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:20,490
blackhat Arsenal is also located there

9
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:21,779
if you'll please take a moment to go

10
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:23,459
ahead and silence your phones for us

11
00:00:21,779 --> 00:00:24,840
please and with that I'm going to give

12
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:34,530
you a Becca Lynch if you can give us a

13
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:36,480
round of applause to get started thanks

14
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:38,700
for being here bright and early today -

15
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:41,339
you made it we're here to talk about

16
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:43,800
diversity specifically gender diversity

17
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:46,079
within our field like you said my name

18
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:47,788
is Becca and I'm here from duo security

19
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:50,010
out of Ann Arbor we're part of Cisco I

20
00:00:47,789 --> 00:00:51,719
also my bachelor's degree in computer

21
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:53,820
science from the University of Michigan

22
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:55,649
and I'm currently a master's student in

23
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:58,410
data science with the University of

24
00:00:55,649 --> 00:01:01,079
Illinois so we're here to talk about

25
00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:02,940
diversity specifically gender diversity

26
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:04,260
but I want to give a couple caveats and

27
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:07,048
what this talk is not going to be about

28
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:08,850
right this is not a talk about teaching

29
00:01:07,049 --> 00:01:11,250
girls to code we're not gonna get into

30
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:13,919
how boys play with Legos and girls play

31
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:16,080
with Barbies this is a perfectly fine

32
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:20,070
conversation to have but it's beside the

33
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:21,658
point and we're gonna see why we're also

34
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:23,758
really not going to talk about why you

35
00:01:21,659 --> 00:01:25,979
should hire more women and this might

36
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:27,810
seem counterintuitive but we're gonna

37
00:01:25,979 --> 00:01:30,960
see that hiring alone is not the full

38
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:33,270
story right and also this is not going

39
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:34,829
to be 25 minutes of blame and shame I'm

40
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:37,110
hoping that by the end of this you'll

41
00:01:34,829 --> 00:01:39,240
all have an understanding of the breadth

42
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:41,250
of the issue at hand as well as clear

43
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:43,589
actionable steps you can take to make

44
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:46,170
our industry a better place and one last

45
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:47,579
caveat this is a talk about gender

46
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:49,409
diversity right so that means we're not

47
00:01:47,579 --> 00:01:51,839
even going to be touching on issues of

48
00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:54,899
racial disparities LGBT representation

49
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:56,250
and even within gender diversity we

50
00:01:54,899 --> 00:01:59,280
can't really even have a conversation

51
00:01:56,250 --> 00:02:01,530
about non-binary and transgender people

52
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:03,210
because there isn't even data on that

53
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:07,110
and that in and of itself is a big

54
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:09,060
problem so we talked about diversity

55
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:10,590
when we talk about diversity hiring

56
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:12,840
we're usually talking about one moment

57
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:15,120
and that's the moment of making a higher

58
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:17,069
when companies say they have diversity

59
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:18,690
initiatives they're talking about hiring

60
00:02:17,069 --> 00:02:21,450
more people right hitting some quota

61
00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:23,190
bringing up some numbers this isn't the

62
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:26,010
full story and it's actually not solving

63
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:27,300
much of anything right for starters it's

64
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:29,160
really hard to build a diverse workforce

65
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:31,560
if we don't have the right building

66
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:33,030
blocks the rate of women graduating with

67
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:35,430
degrees in computer science has been

68
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:37,800
declining since the 80s on the flip side

69
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:39,300
we can't have a conversation about

70
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:43,530
hiring if we're not going to talk about

71
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:46,370
attrition right women in our fields exit

72
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:48,540
within 10 years at twice the rate of men

73
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:51,060
and there all kinds of theories about

74
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:52,769
why right we've seen the manifestos

75
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:55,680
we've heard conversations about

76
00:02:52,769 --> 00:02:57,480
intrinsic ability and biology and I'm

77
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:00,360
here to tell you for lack of a better

78
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:01,950
word it's all complete bullshit we're

79
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:04,560
gonna see why but first let's talk about

80
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:07,170
your team right there was a study with

81
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:09,569
1,400 participants across 21 different

82
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:12,420
companies looking at how gender balance

83
00:03:09,569 --> 00:03:14,760
impacted the productivity of teams and

84
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:17,250
we found that overall the closer that a

85
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:18,450
team was to 50/50 gender balance the

86
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:20,579
more likely they were gonna be to

87
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:22,048
experiment and innovate to share

88
00:03:20,579 --> 00:03:24,000
knowledge among their team members and

89
00:03:22,049 --> 00:03:28,470
most importantly complete tasks on time

90
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:31,260
right this matters we hear this cliche a

91
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:32,760
lot about diversity and how having a

92
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:34,920
diverse team gives you diversity of

93
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:36,750
thought what does this actually mean

94
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:38,940
specifically what does it mean for us in

95
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:42,510
security we talk a lot about risk here

96
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:44,579
right there was a meta-analysis of 115

97
00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:47,130
studies all of which looking at how

98
00:03:44,579 --> 00:03:49,859
gender affected how people perceive risk

99
00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:52,019
found across the board women perceive

100
00:03:49,859 --> 00:03:53,459
risks as higher than men in any given

101
00:03:52,019 --> 00:03:56,579
situation they were more likely to

102
00:03:53,459 --> 00:03:58,380
enumerate specific risks regardless of

103
00:03:56,579 --> 00:04:00,600
the situation even more interestingly

104
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:02,579
white men on average perceived risk than

105
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:05,130
lower than any other demographic group

106
00:04:02,579 --> 00:04:06,870
surveyed right the more homogenous our

107
00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:08,549
teams are the more similar we're going

108
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:11,150
to think and this matters when we're

109
00:04:08,549 --> 00:04:14,670
talking about really complex problems

110
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:16,829
talk about the money a study found last

111
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:18,750
year that companies within the top

112
00:04:16,829 --> 00:04:21,180
quartile for gender diversity we're

113
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:23,310
gonna be 15% more likely to have returns

114
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:24,070
above the industry medians more over

115
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:27,010
turnover

116
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:29,050
is really expensive right study from the

117
00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:31,659
Kapoor Center for social impact last

118
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:33,580
year found that unfairness was cited as

119
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:36,820
the number one reason for leaving tech

120
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:38,979
jobs 37% of people who left their tech

121
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:41,230
job said that they left because of

122
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:43,810
unfair treatment it was the main factor

123
00:04:41,230 --> 00:04:46,750
in their decision of those who left due

124
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:49,390
to unfairness 35% were less likely to

125
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:49,720
recommend the company as a good place to

126
00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:52,719
work

127
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:55,660
and 25% less likely to recommend the

128
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:57,160
product itself this is personal but what

129
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:59,350
does this have to do with diversity the

130
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:02,080
study broke up unfairness into several

131
00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:03,190
key behaviors and these are five of them

132
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:06,010
here we see rudeness

133
00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:07,540
and condescension poor management others

134
00:05:06,010 --> 00:05:09,370
taking credit for your work your

135
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:10,930
co-workers being less educated and

136
00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:13,330
assumptions being made about your skill

137
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:14,800
level and they found that every single

138
00:05:13,330 --> 00:05:17,200
one of these instances women were

139
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:19,680
significantly more likely to have these

140
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:22,360
experiences working in tech right

141
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:23,850
regardless of our initiatives regardless

142
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:25,540
of our quotas these are the lived

143
00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:29,470
experiences of people in our industry

144
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:31,000
every day and it's really expensive this

145
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:33,700
study from their most conservative

146
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:36,130
estimate said that the annual cost due

147
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:39,340
to turnover related to unfairness at

148
00:05:36,130 --> 00:05:41,350
tech companies alone annually 16 billion

149
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:43,780
dollars because we don't know how to

150
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:45,070
treat each other right we're gonna din't

151
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:47,380
we're gonna get into what this looks

152
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:48,700
like in day to day interactions how we

153
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:50,950
can go about approaching it what this

154
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:54,250
really means but first I want to take it

155
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:56,380
back to building the workforce right how

156
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:58,660
do we build a diverse team and this is

157
00:05:56,380 --> 00:06:01,390
kind of commonly referred to as the

158
00:05:58,660 --> 00:06:03,160
pipeline problem right well there just

159
00:06:01,390 --> 00:06:05,530
start women to hire there's no women

160
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:06,910
applying there's nothing I can do it

161
00:06:05,530 --> 00:06:08,799
turns out there is a lot you can do and

162
00:06:06,910 --> 00:06:11,320
it also turns out that it was not always

163
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:13,240
this way the percent of women graduating

164
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:16,030
with computer science degrees peaked in

165
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:17,980
1984 at 37% it's been decreasing ever

166
00:06:16,030 --> 00:06:19,859
since for the last several years it's

167
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:22,060
been stagnant at just about 18%

168
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:24,520
nationally and we're one of the only

169
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:27,460
disciplines to see this decline right

170
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:29,289
degrees like mechanical biomedical

171
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:31,239
environmental civil engineering have all

172
00:06:29,290 --> 00:06:34,990
seen increases in the rate of women

173
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:36,670
graduating with these degrees I want to

174
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:39,160
take a look at my alma mater in

175
00:06:36,670 --> 00:06:41,590
particular there's a really popular

176
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:43,840
computer science course introduction to

177
00:06:41,590 --> 00:06:46,630
programming it has about a thousand

178
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:49,450
students every single semester 40% of

179
00:06:46,630 --> 00:06:52,870
them were women in 2016 the program

180
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:55,000
overall was only 21% women including

181
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:57,070
this massive course graduation rate was

182
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,020
even lower what's happening where are

183
00:06:57,070 --> 00:07:00,940
they going so there was a longitudinal

184
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:02,530
study that looked at women from the

185
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:04,300
moment that they entered a computer

186
00:07:02,530 --> 00:07:05,739
science program to the moment they

187
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:08,470
graduated whether or not they stayed

188
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:10,420
right it found that the attrition level

189
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:11,710
was the highest between the first and

190
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:13,810
second year and this makes sense right

191
00:07:11,710 --> 00:07:16,180
this is when people figure out what they

192
00:07:13,810 --> 00:07:17,650
like what they don't like but this

193
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:19,420
actually wasn't the case the majority of

194
00:07:17,650 --> 00:07:21,190
women leaving programs in computer

195
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:22,990
science were leaving because they didn't

196
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:24,490
feel confident in themselves they cited

197
00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:27,700
low confidence is the main reason and

198
00:07:24,490 --> 00:07:29,710
they cited low confidence regardless of

199
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:32,050
their actual skill levels and abilities

200
00:07:29,710 --> 00:07:34,150
they cited low confidence regardless of

201
00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:36,520
whether they were actually performing at

202
00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:38,650
the same level of their peers the same

203
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:40,599
study maybe unsurprisingly found that

204
00:07:38,650 --> 00:07:42,219
men and women entering these programs

205
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:44,919
had very different levels of prior

206
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:46,570
experience but this didn't really matter

207
00:07:44,919 --> 00:07:48,039
in fact they found that prior experience

208
00:07:46,570 --> 00:07:50,469
was not a significant predictor of

209
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:55,300
success in a four-year program it didn't

210
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:57,430
matter so what do we do there was one

211
00:07:55,300 --> 00:08:00,760
study a few years back that proposed a

212
00:07:57,430 --> 00:08:01,930
solution and they said well men and

213
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:04,210
women maybe they just learned

214
00:08:01,930 --> 00:08:06,640
differently maybe we should teach them

215
00:08:04,210 --> 00:08:07,780
differently maybe we'll have one class

216
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:10,060
for the boys

217
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:12,070
and they're gonna learn programming and

218
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:14,169
all that boring stuff great and then the

219
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:18,390
girls are gonna have a class where they

220
00:08:14,169 --> 00:08:21,430
learn how to program apps for shopping

221
00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:23,469
this did not work it increased levels of

222
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:24,190
isolation it actually increased the rate

223
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:25,720
of attrition

224
00:08:24,190 --> 00:08:27,640
within the program turns out people

225
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:31,450
don't like to feel different they don't

226
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:33,098
like to feel isolated so what do we do I

227
00:08:31,450 --> 00:08:34,450
want to look at one institution in

228
00:08:33,099 --> 00:08:36,790
particular that's doing a lot of things

229
00:08:34,450 --> 00:08:39,910
right Carnegie Mellon has taken a very

230
00:08:36,789 --> 00:08:42,130
intentional approach to retaining and

231
00:08:39,909 --> 00:08:43,620
keeping really smart passionate young

232
00:08:42,130 --> 00:08:46,439
women who are interested in the field

233
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:48,220
and their approach has three key points

234
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:50,530
building a community

235
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:52,600
within the University making sure that

236
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:54,610
anyone who's ready to work hard has

237
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:56,530
people in their corner has people that

238
00:08:54,610 --> 00:08:58,590
they can go to and being intentional

239
00:08:56,530 --> 00:09:00,790
about building this community

240
00:08:58,590 --> 00:09:03,280
emphasizing that there is no experience

241
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:04,990
necessary but it is not a barrier to

242
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:08,650
success in this program and that's

243
00:09:04,990 --> 00:09:10,090
proven and lasts providing visibility

244
00:09:08,650 --> 00:09:12,280
into different pathways in the field

245
00:09:10,090 --> 00:09:14,530
showing young women this is what success

246
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:16,720
looks like these are role models that

247
00:09:14,530 --> 00:09:20,380
you can have this is who you can be and

248
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:22,510
this industry is for you so what does

249
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:24,760
this actually look like they have an

250
00:09:22,510 --> 00:09:25,930
organization called women at SES school

251
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:28,600
in computer science

252
00:09:25,930 --> 00:09:29,920
it looks like outreach that promotes the

253
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:32,200
different pathways into the field

254
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:34,209
including security looks like publishing

255
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:36,010
interviews with successful women within

256
00:09:34,210 --> 00:09:38,140
the field connecting students with

257
00:09:36,010 --> 00:09:39,760
alumni that are successful in their

258
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:41,970
careers opportunities in the community

259
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:44,319
like workshops panels outreach events

260
00:09:41,970 --> 00:09:45,940
internal conferences where women in the

261
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:48,010
program can come together and talk about

262
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:49,900
their work corporate sponsorships and

263
00:09:48,010 --> 00:09:51,460
interviews with faculty to show that

264
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:53,530
there's more than one way to be

265
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:54,580
successful in this industry and here are

266
00:09:53,530 --> 00:09:58,120
the people who are making that possible

267
00:09:54,580 --> 00:10:00,430
and the results speak for themselves in

268
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:01,780
eight years Carnegie Mellon saw the

269
00:10:00,430 --> 00:10:04,660
percent of women enrolling in their

270
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:08,920
computer science program go from 25% to

271
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:10,630
50% 50% in just three years

272
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:12,370
the percent of women graduating with

273
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:14,290
computer science degrees rose by 7

274
00:10:12,370 --> 00:10:16,590
percent this doesn't sound like a whole

275
00:10:14,290 --> 00:10:18,730
lot right 7 percent in just three years

276
00:10:16,590 --> 00:10:22,060
when you consider that the national

277
00:10:18,730 --> 00:10:23,530
average only rose by 0.5% in those same

278
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:26,770
three years they're doing something

279
00:10:23,530 --> 00:10:30,640
right the caveat here is that this only

280
00:10:26,770 --> 00:10:32,829
works if all of us show up right when we

281
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:35,080
participate in our community when we

282
00:10:32,830 --> 00:10:37,150
show up for one another we're sending a

283
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:40,060
message to everyone who's ready to work

284
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:43,540
hard regardless of their gender that

285
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:45,459
this industry is for everyone so we've

286
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:47,589
solved it right now we're gonna hire an

287
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:50,080
amazing workforce they're gonna be great

288
00:10:47,589 --> 00:10:51,370
we're gonna encourage women and tech

289
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:53,530
it's gonna be amazing

290
00:10:51,370 --> 00:10:55,930
turns out we cannot have a conversation

291
00:10:53,530 --> 00:10:57,970
about diversity hiring if we're not

292
00:10:55,930 --> 00:11:00,189
going to have a conversation about the

293
00:10:57,970 --> 00:11:02,590
rate at which women are leaving our

294
00:11:00,190 --> 00:11:04,630
industry so we see here from a study of

295
00:11:02,590 --> 00:11:07,510
thirteen thousand men and women in both

296
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:09,490
stem and non-stem jobs this is the

297
00:11:07,510 --> 00:11:11,830
survival rate for women depending on

298
00:11:09,490 --> 00:11:14,620
their industry seen on stem in the blue

299
00:11:11,830 --> 00:11:16,270
stem in the yellow and the survival rate

300
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:18,610
in the industry means what percent of

301
00:11:16,270 --> 00:11:20,770
women remained in the industry over the

302
00:11:18,610 --> 00:11:23,130
tenure of their career not at their job

303
00:11:20,770 --> 00:11:26,140
not at their company the industry itself

304
00:11:23,130 --> 00:11:28,689
right non-stem role saw a retention rate

305
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:32,650
of about 90 percent over 20 years for

306
00:11:28,690 --> 00:11:35,620
stem it was just below 40 percent the

307
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:36,939
steepest cutoff was at ten years where

308
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:39,610
they saw an attrition rate of forty one

309
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:41,530
percent forty one percent of women who

310
00:11:39,610 --> 00:11:44,620
pursued education who pursued training

311
00:11:41,530 --> 00:11:46,720
who entered the field left after ten

312
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:50,680
years this is double the rate of their

313
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:53,170
male colleagues so what's happening why

314
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:55,569
are they leaving the same survey found

315
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:58,150
that 82 percent of them said that they

316
00:11:55,570 --> 00:12:00,430
love their work women in stem they love

317
00:11:58,150 --> 00:12:02,680
their work 100 percent found it

318
00:12:00,430 --> 00:12:06,310
intellectually challenging stimulating

319
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:09,790
and interesting so why leave are they

320
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:11,949
going of the women in stem who left 77

321
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:14,890
percent said that they cited either

322
00:12:11,950 --> 00:12:16,420
extreme pressure or a hostile macho

323
00:12:14,890 --> 00:12:18,850
culture it's their reason for leaving

324
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:22,120
and I don't know about you my workplace

325
00:12:18,850 --> 00:12:23,920
does not exactly look like the WWE right

326
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:25,900
there's no one lifting weights at their

327
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:28,689
desk you're pounding protein shakes so

328
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:30,910
what's so macho about tech what does

329
00:12:28,690 --> 00:12:33,040
this mean what's happening and it turns

330
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:34,900
out it's really subtle it gets into how

331
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:37,060
we interact with one another on a day to

332
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:38,500
day basis it gets into how do we treat

333
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:41,349
each other how do we talk to one another

334
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:42,610
small things add up and turn out to make

335
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:45,490
a really big difference we're gonna talk

336
00:12:42,610 --> 00:12:48,040
first about implicit bias what does this

337
00:12:45,490 --> 00:12:51,250
look like what does it mean how can we

338
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:52,660
approach it effectively so implicit bias

339
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:55,600
is you can maybe gather from the name

340
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:58,719
it's not explicit it's implicit which

341
00:12:55,600 --> 00:13:01,270
means it's not sexism or racism it's

342
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:03,070
unconscious products of learned behavior

343
00:13:01,270 --> 00:13:05,260
things that are ingrained in who we are

344
00:13:03,070 --> 00:13:07,480
we all have it right it's really

345
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:09,580
difficult to acknowledge it's not

346
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:12,100
intentional and this is key it's not

347
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:13,830
malicious it's ingrained and who we are

348
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:15,810
it's very difficult to over

349
00:13:13,830 --> 00:13:18,019
and it's developed simply by virtue of

350
00:13:15,810 --> 00:13:20,760
living in the world that we live in and

351
00:13:18,019 --> 00:13:22,860
lastly it's not fixed by blame and shame

352
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:24,779
it's not fixed through lecturing and

353
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:26,820
calling out one another right it's fixed

354
00:13:24,779 --> 00:13:29,399
through empathetic conversations and

355
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:30,959
thoughtful productive dialogues right

356
00:13:29,399 --> 00:13:32,820
and I'm not a psychologist I cannot

357
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:34,290
teach you how to have empathy but we're

358
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:37,890
going to go over a few examples of what

359
00:13:34,290 --> 00:13:39,920
this might look like so in action right

360
00:13:37,890 --> 00:13:42,839
it's small things it's little things

361
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:45,390
like using male pronouns to describe a

362
00:13:42,839 --> 00:13:47,160
male or a potential client or a

363
00:13:45,390 --> 00:13:49,260
potential new hire right how many of you

364
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:49,980
have done this I have done this I do

365
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:52,170
this all the time

366
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:53,790
crediting an idea to someone else this

367
00:13:52,170 --> 00:13:56,069
is super easy to do when we can't

368
00:13:53,790 --> 00:13:58,529
acknowledge how our bias influences our

369
00:13:56,070 --> 00:14:00,300
own decisions under estimating others

370
00:13:58,529 --> 00:14:03,209
abilities and making assumptions about

371
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:05,189
their roles this is like when I new hire

372
00:14:03,209 --> 00:14:08,250
came up to me at an event and asked if I

373
00:14:05,190 --> 00:14:09,480
worked in marketing it's not intentional

374
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:12,029
he didn't mean to be mean about it right

375
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:14,490
but it matters think back to this graph

376
00:14:12,029 --> 00:14:16,620
the behaviors that people experienced

377
00:14:14,490 --> 00:14:20,089
that caused them to leave their industry

378
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:22,470
to leave their jobs in tech rudeness

379
00:14:20,089 --> 00:14:24,810
condescension Mis crediting work

380
00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:27,060
understanding under estimating someone's

381
00:14:24,810 --> 00:14:30,089
abilities right all our lived

382
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:32,609
experiences of bias all proven to drive

383
00:14:30,089 --> 00:14:35,430
talented people away from the field and

384
00:14:32,610 --> 00:14:38,970
all experience significantly more by

385
00:14:35,430 --> 00:14:41,489
women than by men so what does this look

386
00:14:38,970 --> 00:14:43,140
like we're gonna imagine a scenario

387
00:14:41,490 --> 00:14:45,180
you've gone out to lunch with one of

388
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:47,370
your co-workers and you start to discuss

389
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:49,380
a new colleague on your team your

390
00:14:47,370 --> 00:14:51,420
co-worker says something like this she

391
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:53,310
seems kind of aggressive all right this

392
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:55,380
is a loaded statement we're not even

393
00:14:53,310 --> 00:14:57,390
gonna get into what this really means

394
00:14:55,380 --> 00:15:01,079
the gender dynamics of all this because

395
00:14:57,390 --> 00:15:03,839
it's kind of irrelevant the key here is

396
00:15:01,079 --> 00:15:05,939
to maintain assumptions of positive

397
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:07,829
intent right this does not mean

398
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:10,350
lecturing or calling out your colleague

399
00:15:07,829 --> 00:15:11,550
putting them on the defensive and giving

400
00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:13,949
them the ability to shut down the

401
00:15:11,550 --> 00:15:16,349
conversation right no I'm not sexist why

402
00:15:13,949 --> 00:15:18,870
would you say that you want to leave

403
00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:21,449
room for a dialogue assume positive

404
00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:23,760
intent this is a key part of our culture

405
00:15:21,449 --> 00:15:25,469
a duo where I work what does this look

406
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:27,550
like it means asking questions right

407
00:15:25,470 --> 00:15:29,790
getting them to nail down specific

408
00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:32,529
actions right what makes you say that

409
00:15:29,790 --> 00:15:34,480
this gives them room to point out

410
00:15:32,529 --> 00:15:36,250
specific things that cause them to feel

411
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:38,350
the way that they feel and you might

412
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:40,320
find that in having this conversation

413
00:15:38,350 --> 00:15:44,170
they'll reevaluate their own perspective

414
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:46,240
same scenario different colleague says

415
00:15:44,170 --> 00:15:47,339
something like this she's very

416
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:49,420
articulate

417
00:15:47,339 --> 00:15:51,940
both of these are things that I've heard

418
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:54,939
about women that I work with she's very

419
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:56,829
articulate and face value this seems

420
00:15:54,940 --> 00:16:00,310
like it's kind of maybe supposed to be a

421
00:15:56,829 --> 00:16:02,349
compliment right she's articulate what

422
00:16:00,310 --> 00:16:06,160
does this mean means she can speak in

423
00:16:02,350 --> 00:16:07,870
sentences it's kind of a given right how

424
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:09,790
do we have a conversation about this

425
00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:12,160
that doesn't put our colleagues on the

426
00:16:09,790 --> 00:16:14,079
defensive this is a point where private

427
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:15,279
feedback is going to be key we don't

428
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:17,920
want to give them room to end the

429
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:20,110
conversation similarly frame the

430
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:22,810
feedback within the context of your own

431
00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:25,029
perception feel that by saying that you

432
00:16:22,810 --> 00:16:26,859
might imply that you assumed otherwise

433
00:16:25,029 --> 00:16:28,810
this is wordy you don't have to say it

434
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:30,250
like this the key is that you're framing

435
00:16:28,810 --> 00:16:33,760
it within the context of your own

436
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:36,370
emotions about her experience about your

437
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:38,230
co-workers experience this isn't really

438
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:39,820
accusatory and what it does is it

439
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:41,740
doesn't give them room to make excuses

440
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:43,870
well that's not what I meant it's

441
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:48,190
irrelevant this is how someone perceived

442
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:50,770
it and that matters another threat to

443
00:16:48,190 --> 00:16:53,529
retention of women in tech particularly

444
00:16:50,770 --> 00:16:55,630
as a Singh called stereotype threat so

445
00:16:53,529 --> 00:16:58,480
anytime that you are an underrepresented

446
00:16:55,630 --> 00:17:00,130
group within some larger organization

447
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:01,779
some larger field right there are

448
00:17:00,130 --> 00:17:04,000
typically negative stereotypes about

449
00:17:01,779 --> 00:17:07,419
your performance your abilities and

450
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:09,490
these affect us right stereotype threat

451
00:17:07,419 --> 00:17:12,189
is the fear that one will fall into

452
00:17:09,490 --> 00:17:14,250
existing negative stereotypes about

453
00:17:12,189 --> 00:17:16,630
yourself about your people

454
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:18,880
it increases anxiety and it's been

455
00:17:16,630 --> 00:17:20,800
proven to decrease productivity and

456
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:23,110
performance right and this is really

457
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:26,619
hard to address how do we change how

458
00:17:23,109 --> 00:17:28,030
people feel about themselves right it

459
00:17:26,619 --> 00:17:29,469
can start with increasing the visibility

460
00:17:28,030 --> 00:17:31,090
of men and women from different

461
00:17:29,470 --> 00:17:33,040
backgrounds within all levels of your

462
00:17:31,090 --> 00:17:34,830
organization if you can write

463
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:37,659
highlighting the talent that you have

464
00:17:34,830 --> 00:17:39,639
showing people here is someone who is

465
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:40,000
successful here is someone who has made

466
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:42,250
it

467
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:45,130
here's proof that you can - and you can

468
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:47,050
do it here convey your high value of

469
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:49,030
diversity right we've seen the proven

470
00:17:47,050 --> 00:17:50,889
benefits of having a diversity

471
00:17:49,030 --> 00:17:52,060
show that this is something that you

472
00:17:50,890 --> 00:17:55,600
believe in and that you're committed to

473
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:57,790
and be vocal about it convey high

474
00:17:55,600 --> 00:18:00,370
standards and frame feedback within the

475
00:17:57,790 --> 00:18:01,570
context of these high standards this

476
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:02,949
seems counterintuitive right we're

477
00:18:01,570 --> 00:18:05,740
talking about people who underestimate

478
00:18:02,950 --> 00:18:06,300
themselves right we don't want to make

479
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:09,190
that works

480
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:11,290
this means framing feedback within the

481
00:18:09,190 --> 00:18:13,570
context of your own high standards it's

482
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:15,520
not I have high standards and you're not

483
00:18:13,570 --> 00:18:17,439
going to live up to them it's I have

484
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:17,830
high standards and that's why I hired

485
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:19,870
you

486
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:22,030
that's why I want to work with you

487
00:18:19,870 --> 00:18:26,100
that's why I know that you can do the

488
00:18:22,030 --> 00:18:29,230
job and last one of the most proven

489
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:31,300
impactful methods of retaining smart

490
00:18:29,230 --> 00:18:33,460
women in your organization is

491
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:36,970
sponsorship it's similar to mentorship

492
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:38,920
there are a few key differences a mentor

493
00:18:36,970 --> 00:18:41,560
is someone who provides tips and advice

494
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:43,480
about your day to day a sponsor is

495
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:45,460
someone who provides public and private

496
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:48,070
advocacy for you within the organization

497
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:49,570
a mentor is going to be someone who

498
00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:50,710
increases your confidence your

499
00:18:49,570 --> 00:18:53,679
competence these are all great things

500
00:18:50,710 --> 00:18:55,390
right a sponsor is someone who enables

501
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:57,640
your career advancement and visibility

502
00:18:55,390 --> 00:18:58,810
within the organization they're gonna

503
00:18:57,640 --> 00:19:00,520
make sure you're working on the right

504
00:18:58,810 --> 00:19:03,909
work and that your work is seen by the

505
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:05,800
right people and last a mentorship is a

506
00:19:03,910 --> 00:19:07,780
relationship that's generally formed by

507
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:09,220
the request of the mentee or through

508
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:12,629
some formal program like an internship

509
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:14,590
and onboarding process things like that

510
00:19:12,630 --> 00:19:16,690
sponsorship is a relationship that's

511
00:19:14,590 --> 00:19:19,689
formed by the efforts of the sponsor

512
00:19:16,690 --> 00:19:22,540
right this is someone who goes out of

513
00:19:19,690 --> 00:19:25,390
their way to take organic effective

514
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:26,620
actions to form a relationship to stand

515
00:19:25,390 --> 00:19:29,230
up for their co-workers what does this

516
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:30,820
look like an action the mentor might be

517
00:19:29,230 --> 00:19:33,700
someone who goes to their colleague and

518
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:35,560
says I know you should work on X and

519
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:37,800
I'll help you get set up I am this

520
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:39,940
project I'm gonna help you do it a

521
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:41,770
mentor is going to be someone with

522
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:43,420
connections they're gonna go to their

523
00:19:41,770 --> 00:19:46,750
peers they're gonna go to people above

524
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:48,400
them and say I hear you have a project I

525
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:50,620
know someone who would be great and

526
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:52,750
here's why I hear you want to send

527
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:53,330
people to blackhat you should send this

528
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:55,190
person

529
00:19:53,330 --> 00:19:57,559
here's why I here you want someone to

530
00:19:55,190 --> 00:20:00,200
speak at the next team meeting I know

531
00:19:57,559 --> 00:20:03,200
who should do it right there in your

532
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:05,539
corner and this is proven to work the

533
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:07,759
value speaks for itself when we see data

534
00:20:05,539 --> 00:20:09,470
on sponsored versus unspun surd women

535
00:20:07,759 --> 00:20:11,450
sponsored women were more likely to

536
00:20:09,470 --> 00:20:13,519
report a satisfactory pace and

537
00:20:11,450 --> 00:20:15,710
promotions they were more likely to ask

538
00:20:13,519 --> 00:20:17,629
for high-visibility work and perhaps

539
00:20:15,710 --> 00:20:20,869
most strikingly mothers who were

540
00:20:17,629 --> 00:20:22,580
sponsored were over 25% more likely to

541
00:20:20,869 --> 00:20:24,889
stay with their employer than mothers

542
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:27,109
who are unspun surd this makes sense

543
00:20:24,889 --> 00:20:28,758
right you know you have someone that's

544
00:20:27,109 --> 00:20:30,678
gonna go to bat for you it's gonna

545
00:20:28,759 --> 00:20:35,059
promote your work it's gonna connect you

546
00:20:30,679 --> 00:20:37,369
to the right people so we've covered a

547
00:20:35,059 --> 00:20:40,580
lot of ground right this is a huge

548
00:20:37,369 --> 00:20:42,738
complicated problem but hopefully now

549
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:44,840
you see that this is more than hiring

550
00:20:42,739 --> 00:20:46,820
this is more than the pipeline right

551
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:48,859
this comes down to how we treat each

552
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:51,739
other and how the things we say impact

553
00:20:48,859 --> 00:20:54,350
everyone all right but it's not hopeless

554
00:20:51,739 --> 00:20:55,580
there's a lot that you can do starts

555
00:20:54,350 --> 00:20:57,439
with getting involved at a local

556
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:59,600
university college programs that support

557
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:02,629
and encourage women and diversity at all

558
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:04,549
levels participating in local workshops

559
00:21:02,629 --> 00:21:06,259
that promote diversity not only is this

560
00:21:04,549 --> 00:21:08,090
great for visibility for young women

561
00:21:06,259 --> 00:21:10,909
it's also kind of selfish you want to

562
00:21:08,090 --> 00:21:12,678
hire some really great people within

563
00:21:10,909 --> 00:21:15,320
your organization it means visibly

564
00:21:12,679 --> 00:21:17,600
supporting diversity initiatives and

565
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:19,939
being a spokesperson being vocal about

566
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:24,678
the proven benefits of a diverse team

567
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:26,929
we've seen that it works recognizing and

568
00:21:24,679 --> 00:21:29,179
addressing your own bias in your work

569
00:21:26,929 --> 00:21:31,940
environment being willing to think

570
00:21:29,179 --> 00:21:34,220
inward before you speak being willing to

571
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:36,950
have tough conversations with your

572
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:39,109
colleagues being willing to understand

573
00:21:36,950 --> 00:21:41,840
how the things we say and do impact the

574
00:21:39,109 --> 00:21:43,369
people that we work with and last

575
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:45,738
advocating and supporting one another

576
00:21:43,369 --> 00:21:47,869
through efforts like sponsorship right

577
00:21:45,739 --> 00:21:49,700
going to bat for our colleagues making

578
00:21:47,869 --> 00:21:52,009
sure that everyone knows that they have

579
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:53,600
people in their corner and that women

580
00:21:52,009 --> 00:21:55,789
who want to come to this industry have

581
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:58,730
space to stay and succeed and they have

582
00:21:55,789 --> 00:22:00,830
that space with you this is a really

583
00:21:58,730 --> 00:22:04,309
complicated problem but the solutions

584
00:22:00,830 --> 00:22:06,289
are simple they come down to empathy to

585
00:22:04,309 --> 00:22:07,120
understanding and just showing up for

586
00:22:06,289 --> 00:22:09,020
one another

587
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:09,300
thank you

588
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:10,240
[Applause]

589
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:15,999
