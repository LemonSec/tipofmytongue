I'm Eric dirt and I'm here to talk to

16
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:52,770
you about supply chain attacks and you

17
00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:54,809
you whatever you do and whatever

18
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:56,760
organization you're part of you really

19
00:00:54,809 --> 00:00:58,589
can't defend your company or your

20
00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:00,539
customer as well if you're not thinking

21
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:02,699
holistically about supply chain attacks

22
00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:04,110
and I talk to a lot of people across the

23
00:01:02,699 --> 00:01:06,330
industry and I think a lot of people

24
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:08,010
focus on some of the wrong things and so

25
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:09,869
I'm here to share some of what we see in

26
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:14,310
some of what we learned in the hopes

27
00:01:09,869 --> 00:01:16,680
that we'll help you guys I'm I work in

28
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:18,869
the MSR seat I think we're best known

29
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:20,520
for kind of working with external

30
00:01:18,869 --> 00:01:22,020
security researchers and helping people

31
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:24,240
share vulnerabilities and getting them

32
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:27,149
fixed we also work across the company

33
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:29,579
and some of the Cross Company incidents

34
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:32,430
that we see and so we see a lot of weird

35
00:01:29,579 --> 00:01:34,439
stuff and we work with dozens of

36
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:35,939
security teams inside of Microsoft and

37
00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:38,070
I'm here representing some of the work

38
00:01:35,939 --> 00:01:40,589
of those people so I hope you enjoy the

39
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:43,648
day so I want to start by telling you a

40
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:45,600
little story because I think there's a

41
00:01:43,649 --> 00:01:47,220
few different ways that people think

42
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:49,439
about supply chain a little bit wrong

43
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:51,600
and and so let's just start with what

44
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:54,089
everybody knows which is the world lives

45
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:56,250
actually on top of a giant turtle I

46
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:58,049
learned this in the 80s from an author

47
00:01:56,250 --> 00:02:01,979
called Terry Pratchett who wrote a bunch

48
00:01:58,049 --> 00:02:03,960
of novels about the Discworld and and I

49
00:02:01,979 --> 00:02:05,820
don't know you know it read about this

50
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:08,340
and Terry Pratchett actually borrowed

51
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:10,949
this from Hindu mythology where there's

52
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:12,930
a story about the earth is flat it's on

53
00:02:10,949 --> 00:02:14,819
these elephants it's on this

54
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:18,060
on this giant turtle and there's this

55
00:02:14,819 --> 00:02:19,920
story about that mythology where a

56
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:22,290
little boy meets an old lady in the

57
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:24,750
woods and says well that can't be true

58
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:26,129
because you know if first the world is

59
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:27,569
round and she says well it's not round

60
00:02:26,129 --> 00:02:31,108
if it was round it would roll off the

61
00:02:27,569 --> 00:02:32,969
turtle and then the little boy says and

62
00:02:31,109 --> 00:02:36,540
she said look it's clearly flat and then

63
00:02:32,969 --> 00:02:38,250
the little boy says well but then what

64
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:39,659
is the turtle on thinking he's stumped

65
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:41,760
her and she said well of course it's on

66
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:43,980
another turtle and he said ah but what's

67
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:46,980
that turtle on and she said well it's on

68
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:49,500
another turtle son it's Turtles all the

69
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:53,700
way down and I think that that's really

70
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:56,040
a way to think about supply chain a lot

71
00:02:53,700 --> 00:03:00,388
of us are thinking that supply chain is

72
00:02:56,040 --> 00:03:02,489
a solo effort that it's me and I'm

73
00:03:00,389 --> 00:03:05,310
trying to make sure my suppliers are

74
00:03:02,489 --> 00:03:06,959
doing the right stuff so that I can

75
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:10,079
protect my company and protect my

76
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:12,419
customers but we're all Turtles and no

77
00:03:10,079 --> 00:03:14,969
one's the top turtle there's a people

78
00:03:12,419 --> 00:03:18,000
above us and people below us and it goes

79
00:03:14,969 --> 00:03:19,978
on forever and if we think about supply

80
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,650
chain that way if we think about supply

81
00:03:19,979 --> 00:03:24,479
chain is a team sport not an individual

82
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:26,129
sport I think we do very different

83
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:28,109
things as an industry and I think we'd

84
00:03:26,129 --> 00:03:30,209
have much more successful outcomes and

85
00:03:28,109 --> 00:03:35,280
so that's some of what I want to talk

86
00:03:30,209 --> 00:03:35,909
about today so the punchline I mean your

87
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:38,579
supply chain

88
00:03:35,909 --> 00:03:39,540
you're probably in mind and we're in

89
00:03:38,579 --> 00:03:44,669
this together

90
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:46,168
and that's how we got to start acting so

91
00:03:44,669 --> 00:03:47,430
am I in your supply chain how many

92
00:03:46,169 --> 00:03:49,650
people I'm gonna make you guys work a

93
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:51,780
little bit I'm trying to see past the

94
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:54,439
lights how many people think that

95
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:57,389
Microsoft is in your supply chain today

96
00:03:54,439 --> 00:03:58,709
most of the room and you know we got a

97
00:03:57,389 --> 00:04:01,049
bunch of stuff that's been around for a

98
00:03:58,709 --> 00:04:04,019
long time you know but we also have

99
00:04:01,049 --> 00:04:07,159
newer things like github millions

100
00:04:04,019 --> 00:04:10,560
developers who use it do you use a tool

101
00:04:07,159 --> 00:04:12,840
that was written on github or do you use

102
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:14,879
a company that uses a tool that was

103
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:17,608
written on github well and then I'm in

104
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:18,959
your supply chain obviously office much

105
00:04:17,608 --> 00:04:23,070
of the world's community organizational

106
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:24,539
communication LinkedIn a lot of us try

107
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:26,790
to get jobs using LinkedIn and other

108
00:04:24,539 --> 00:04:30,330
things like that obviously as your

109
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:33,270
Windows Xbox and more so I think it's

110
00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:35,010
safe to say that most people have

111
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:37,680
Microsoft in their supply chain in some

112
00:04:35,010 --> 00:04:39,270
way but how about the inverse do you

113
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:40,650
think that you're in my supply chain how

114
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:44,250
many people think that they're in my

115
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:48,989
supply chain today laughs you bet you

116
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:51,330
it's most you know Linux is the most

117
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:53,160
popular operating system on Azure how

118
00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:58,380
many people work on Linux in some way

119
00:04:53,160 --> 00:05:00,240
shape or form a few we've about 35,000

120
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:02,219
unique open source projects that we

121
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:03,990
ingest and consume in Microsoft in

122
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:09,210
various ways how many people work on

123
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:11,190
open source lots we use over 10,000

124
00:05:09,210 --> 00:05:13,919
third-party tools in various places in

125
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:18,210
Microsoft I you know of course we have a

126
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:21,660
list I can't name them but you know of

127
00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:24,239
course we have factories and hardware

128
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:26,250
supply chains for devices like Xbox and

129
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:28,350
surface and hololens and others and all

130
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:30,600
that sits on top of a bunch of more

131
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:32,670
Turtles and then of course we have the

132
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:34,170
Microsoft cloud the data centers and

133
00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:35,520
hardware infrastructure and networking

134
00:05:34,170 --> 00:05:38,430
gear and all that stuff that goes into

135
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:40,680
it so I think it's it's it's

136
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:42,810
increasingly clear to me as we've seen

137
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:45,710
supply chain incidents over the years

138
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:48,810
that that we're all in this together and

139
00:05:45,710 --> 00:05:50,400
it's way more interconnected than people

140
00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:52,260
think it is and the world is getting

141
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:55,169
increasingly interconnected every single

142
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:57,150
day but we don't act like it's

143
00:05:55,170 --> 00:06:00,630
interconnected and I think that's got to

144
00:05:57,150 --> 00:06:03,659
change so let's start with what I'm not

145
00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:06,350
gonna talk about if all you did was read

146
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:09,960
with if all you did was read the news

147
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:12,180
you'd think that Hardware implants and

148
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:14,070
chip tampering and masking and

149
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:15,840
intercepting packages and unpacking

150
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:18,540
laptops and repacking them and resetting

151
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:21,630
them was just rampant and of course that

152
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:23,130
stuff does happen and there's amazing

153
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:26,640
research that goes into that

154
00:06:23,130 --> 00:06:28,560
we even had a researcher in this field a

155
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:31,440
guy named bunny Lange who came to our

156
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:33,390
blue hat Israel and earlier in the year

157
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:36,690
did an amazing talk on these techniques

158
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:38,280
and some companies really do have to pay

159
00:06:36,690 --> 00:06:40,590
a lot of attention to these kind of

160
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:42,059
attack vectors but again you

161
00:06:40,590 --> 00:06:43,950
get the media reports and you think oh

162
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:48,930
my god that's everybody's top priority

163
00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:51,000
and I don't think that's true no fucker

164
00:06:48,930 --> 00:06:53,460
there we go so I'm not talking about

165
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,530
Huawei this is the last time I talked

166
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:56,880
about Huawei in the presentation I'm not

167
00:06:55,530 --> 00:06:58,530
talking about Super Micro or anything

168
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:00,420
like that are you those other prominent

169
00:06:58,530 --> 00:07:02,880
news stories and I'm definitely not

170
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:03,570
talking about spectrum meltdown I did

171
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:07,650
that last year

172
00:07:03,570 --> 00:07:09,360
I'm kind of done with the topic so so

173
00:07:07,650 --> 00:07:10,979
let's just talk about switching risk so

174
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:13,050
how does Microsoft think about supply

175
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:16,650
chain risk and we tried to kind of zoom

176
00:07:13,050 --> 00:07:18,900
out and categorize this stuff and say is

177
00:07:16,650 --> 00:07:22,049
there a simple framework that we can use

178
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:24,929
to help us think of reason about supply

179
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:26,580
chain risk apply threat modeling

180
00:07:24,930 --> 00:07:28,080
techniques and things like that to make

181
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:29,760
sure that we're being smart about where

182
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:31,169
we're spending our time and energy to

183
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:34,820
protect ourselves in our extended

184
00:07:31,170 --> 00:07:40,800
ecosystem and so it really boils down to

185
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:42,900
four categories my my my text got out of

186
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:44,760
out of the spacing but oh well all right

187
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:46,679
we've got the hardware turtle yep

188
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:48,030
hardware's the thing and like I said

189
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:50,280
there is chip masking and things like

190
00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:51,659
that but definitely is a thing I think

191
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:53,340
most people probably should worry more

192
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:55,200
about IOT and I'm gonna talk about that

193
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:58,130
a little bit later when it comes to

194
00:07:55,200 --> 00:08:00,450
hardware so off word clearly a thing

195
00:07:58,130 --> 00:08:01,620
there's definitely media that's focused

196
00:08:00,450 --> 00:08:03,960
on software and I think that's good

197
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:06,930
because software is a pretty easy way to

198
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:09,299
go and try to attack someone and so

199
00:08:06,930 --> 00:08:10,740
that's definitely a category services we

200
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:13,010
don't talk about very much and here I

201
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:15,210
mean just any old endpoint you might use

202
00:08:13,010 --> 00:08:16,950
do you think about that in the same way

203
00:08:15,210 --> 00:08:21,630
are you applying the same kind of threat

204
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:23,430
modeling and then what about people you

205
00:08:21,630 --> 00:08:25,170
know what about the partners and vendors

206
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:27,030
that are in your supply chain are you

207
00:08:25,170 --> 00:08:28,800
thinking about that as an asset that

208
00:08:27,030 --> 00:08:30,390
needs to be defended and be thinking

209
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:34,020
about controls that need to be in place

210
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:35,460
there we think you should so let's jump

211
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:38,640
in but before I jump in so I'm gonna

212
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:41,700
tell a couple stories about incidents

213
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:43,890
we've seen in each of those categories

214
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:45,570
and but I want to give you just a little

215
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:47,640
bit of context about what defending

216
00:08:45,570 --> 00:08:49,830
Microsoft is like because I think that

217
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:51,870
it'd be easy to think we're all the same

218
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:53,790
that we also be easy to think that we're

219
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:54,060
really different and I think that you

220
00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:55,589
know

221
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:57,030
whether you work at a start-up of five

222
00:08:55,590 --> 00:08:59,580
people or you work at a fortune 100

223
00:08:57,030 --> 00:09:01,140
company I bet you that there's a lot of

224
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:02,700
overlap of the things that we need to

225
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:04,650
worry about and the things you guys need

226
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:06,180
to worry about too and so I want to

227
00:09:04,650 --> 00:09:09,780
share just a couple of quick stats on

228
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:11,280
that so here's some quick stats on what

229
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:15,240
the Microsoft environment looks like

230
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:16,920
today and I'm not gonna belabor a bunch

231
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:19,860
of these things but lots of employees

232
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:22,650
lots of devices per employee a ton of

233
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:25,140
services a complicated identity system

234
00:09:22,650 --> 00:09:27,329
with a lot of traffic a ton of data

235
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:29,280
centers a complicated payment platform

236
00:09:27,330 --> 00:09:31,230
like just a bunch of stuff that you got

237
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:33,839
to think about as you think about how do

238
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:35,760
I defend the perimeter of Microsoft and

239
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:37,380
how do I make sure that not only we but

240
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:40,490
the people that build on top of our

241
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:43,290
products and platforms are also secure

242
00:09:40,490 --> 00:09:44,970
of course the cloud is a big deal just

243
00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:47,130
thinking about over a hundred data

244
00:09:44,970 --> 00:09:48,840
centers scattered around the world with

245
00:09:47,130 --> 00:09:51,290
all the challenges of that come from

246
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:54,780
that defending the physical and virtual

247
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:58,199
supply chains around that it's a big job

248
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:59,910
so it's hard so how do we do it and I'll

249
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:01,530
and I'll share some of kind of the

250
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:04,380
specific tactics that we use in the

251
00:10:01,530 --> 00:10:06,360
context of the individual incidents but

252
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:08,730
but a big part of how we do it is how we

253
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:10,200
think about defending Microsoft and so

254
00:10:08,730 --> 00:10:12,270
this is something that came together for

255
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:13,890
us a few years ago and it's something

256
00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:16,439
that we call the cyber defense

257
00:10:13,890 --> 00:10:18,569
Operations Center and it's really a

258
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:19,860
concept it's also with some physical

259
00:10:18,570 --> 00:10:21,150
locations but I want to kind of put this

260
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:23,100
put in perspective because otherwise

261
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:25,949
it's gonna seem strange when I start

262
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:27,930
talking about the incidents we've got of

263
00:10:25,950 --> 00:10:30,090
course thousands of security experts

264
00:10:27,930 --> 00:10:32,339
across Microsoft and they're embedded in

265
00:10:30,090 --> 00:10:34,200
the individual teams cuz they need to be

266
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:37,500
experts on those technologies but the

267
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:39,030
problem is the bad actors don't respect

268
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:42,510
our organizational boundaries which i

269
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:45,839
think is rude but they don't and so they

270
00:10:42,510 --> 00:10:47,520
come and attack us and we got a defense

271
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:49,140
so how do we defend and how do we defend

272
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:51,329
together and make sure that the fact

273
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:54,930
that we have experts embedded is an

274
00:10:51,330 --> 00:10:57,870
asset not a weakness and so we've spent

275
00:10:54,930 --> 00:11:00,120
years pulling teams together sharing

276
00:10:57,870 --> 00:11:01,560
tools analytics platform detection

277
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:03,120
platforms things like that so that you

278
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:05,699
get the best of both worlds you get the

279
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:06,830
ability to kind of defend as one and see

280
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:10,790
across the

281
00:11:06,830 --> 00:11:13,160
our enterprise as well as as well as the

282
00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:15,469
ability to have really deep expertise in

283
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:18,199
unique areas of technology or unique

284
00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:20,300
areas of our business and so we call

285
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:22,070
this the sea dock cyber defense

286
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:23,900
Operations Center because of course the

287
00:11:22,070 --> 00:11:25,040
world needs more acronyms and I'm sure

288
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:28,640
I'll throw a couple of more at you

289
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:30,650
during the talk today and and this is a

290
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:32,620
big part of how we've been able to help

291
00:11:30,650 --> 00:11:34,610
our customers and help ourselves facing

292
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:37,760
uh-oh and this is the other thing about

293
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:39,260
hey I'm just one guy I help some of this

294
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:41,000
stuff but there's you know many many

295
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:42,230
other people that have helped with some

296
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,460
of these things I'm talking about today

297
00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:45,050
so I want to give big shout out to them

298
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:47,000
for all the work they do to protect

299
00:11:45,050 --> 00:11:48,469
customers only one of us gets to be on

300
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,750
stage okay

301
00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:53,000
so let's jump in with people and I start

302
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:56,450
with people because I think it is the V

303
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:58,880
for most companies the biggest risk it's

304
00:11:56,450 --> 00:12:00,620
probably the least well understood and

305
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:02,630
it's probably the easiest to mitigate

306
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:05,480
with the tools that you have it at your

307
00:12:02,630 --> 00:12:07,130
disposal and so let's just start with in

308
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:09,560
April of this year you might have read

309
00:12:07,130 --> 00:12:11,900
some of these articles and they were

310
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:14,770
pretty interesting because what these

311
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:17,360
articles talked about was how there was

312
00:12:14,770 --> 00:12:19,189
evidence that there was a problem at

313
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:21,380
Wipro with pros one of the largest IT

314
00:12:19,190 --> 00:12:25,280
staffing agencies in the world and as

315
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:26,600
the media unfolded there was some some

316
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:27,829
evidence that perhaps it was broader

317
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:29,510
than Wipro perhaps some of these other

318
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:31,280
these other staffing agencies were

319
00:12:29,510 --> 00:12:35,840
impacted and of course this isn't the

320
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:38,660
first time we've seen this the we think

321
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:41,030
that the some of the Olympic stuff might

322
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:42,829
have had a component of this as well so

323
00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:44,089
it's not like the first time this has

324
00:12:42,830 --> 00:12:47,420
ever happened but this one definitely

325
00:12:44,090 --> 00:12:49,430
caught our attention and and and I'll

326
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:51,349
just pause here and say I think anyone

327
00:12:49,430 --> 00:12:54,199
who's in Incident Response knows you

328
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:56,000
spend a lot of your time chasing things

329
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:59,240
down that turn out to be false alarms

330
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:03,080
and that's like weirdly good and weirdly

331
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:05,450
frustrating at the same time but at the

332
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:07,100
time that you mobilize you know you

333
00:13:05,450 --> 00:13:08,330
never know what's going to be a false

334
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:12,250
alarm and what's not going to be a false

335
00:13:08,330 --> 00:13:17,540
alarm so so what happened in this case

336
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:18,890
is we had we had some intelligence that

337
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:21,349
there might be a problem well you know

338
00:13:18,890 --> 00:13:23,780
if it's real but we

339
00:13:21,350 --> 00:13:26,180
it led us to ask the question hey you

340
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:27,680
know what's our risk exposure let's

341
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:29,270
assume the worst let's assume there's a

342
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:30,560
real problem at Wipro let's assume

343
00:13:29,270 --> 00:13:33,710
there's a real problem at some other

344
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:35,510
staffing agencies we have 135,000

345
00:13:33,710 --> 00:13:37,850
employees we have tens of thousands of

346
00:13:35,510 --> 00:13:40,310
partners and vendors embedded in various

347
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:43,730
aspects of our company of course we have

348
00:13:40,310 --> 00:13:47,479
policies and and procedures about where

349
00:13:43,730 --> 00:13:49,220
those people should be embedded but you

350
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:50,510
never know right and so you want to

351
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:52,880
mobilize and figure out what your risk

352
00:13:50,510 --> 00:13:54,110
is and it was particularly insidious as

353
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:57,110
we're reading and learning more about

354
00:13:54,110 --> 00:14:00,650
what appeared to be happening kind of

355
00:13:57,110 --> 00:14:03,110
the sophistication of the actor how

356
00:14:00,650 --> 00:14:05,600
targeted they were at least it appeared

357
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:07,580
on things like quick cash gift cards and

358
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:10,160
things like that and so when one lens

359
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:12,110
you could say boy you know I mean

360
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:14,900
Microsoft does a lot of things but you

361
00:14:12,110 --> 00:14:16,910
know we're not really the kind of quick

362
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:19,400
cash target that that some other

363
00:14:16,910 --> 00:14:21,350
companies might be I mean you got Xbox

364
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:22,370
Xbox has gift cards and points and

365
00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:24,590
things like that so maybe that's a

366
00:14:22,370 --> 00:14:26,600
target well you know we've got our

367
00:14:24,590 --> 00:14:28,190
universal store you know millions of

368
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:30,530
transactions flow through that every day

369
00:14:28,190 --> 00:14:33,470
ok maybe we could be a target after all

370
00:14:30,530 --> 00:14:35,510
so and so but in any case you know we

371
00:14:33,470 --> 00:14:38,090
mobilize we start looking at this and we

372
00:14:35,510 --> 00:14:39,560
quickly realize that actually yeah with

373
00:14:38,090 --> 00:14:41,300
pros a big partner because of course we

374
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:43,670
have an inventory of all the vendors and

375
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:45,319
and partners who are in various aspects

376
00:14:43,670 --> 00:14:47,719
of the business yep

377
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:49,610
we definitely with pros a big partner we

378
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:51,290
have thousands of Wipro employees that

379
00:14:49,610 --> 00:14:52,880
are working in various parts of

380
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:58,670
Microsoft doing important and necessary

381
00:14:52,880 --> 00:15:01,820
jobs of course you know it's I love the

382
00:14:58,670 --> 00:15:04,250
moment in an incident where you have

383
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:07,460
threat model the thing and now you're

384
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:09,380
testing your threat model okay so we

385
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:10,430
have policy that says vendors should do

386
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:13,400
these kinds of things and not these

387
00:15:10,430 --> 00:15:15,560
other kinds of things sometimes you

388
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:17,750
think more crisply about something in a

389
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:19,670
crisis than you do in the abstract

390
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:21,620
before the crisis so it's always such a

391
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:25,729
great opportunity to retest that thought

392
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:28,280
process even if your process is perfect

393
00:15:25,730 --> 00:15:30,110
are you following it perfectly we all

394
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:31,520
know humans are fallible we'd love to

395
00:15:30,110 --> 00:15:33,590
automate absolutely everything in the

396
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:34,850
universe we haven't quite done that yet

397
00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:36,259
and so there's not

398
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:39,380
opportunity for mistakes we made so what

399
00:15:36,259 --> 00:15:43,579
do we do we go and look at our inventory

400
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:46,490
we do an audit a fast audit to see is

401
00:15:43,579 --> 00:15:50,750
anybody in some particularly sensitive

402
00:15:46,490 --> 00:15:52,490
space that's kind of step one as more

403
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:53,899
evidence starts to come out we these are

404
00:15:52,490 --> 00:15:55,490
some domains we're worried about rate

405
00:15:53,899 --> 00:15:58,009
let's just block them like let's make

406
00:15:55,490 --> 00:16:01,579
sure that that you know we're not going

407
00:15:58,009 --> 00:16:04,370
to be a subject of the abuse

408
00:16:01,579 --> 00:16:07,250
you know let's go look for signs of

409
00:16:04,370 --> 00:16:08,990
malicious activity but just in case like

410
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:10,490
let's go roll the credentials just a

411
00:16:08,990 --> 00:16:13,339
precautionary measure yeah it's annoying

412
00:16:10,490 --> 00:16:16,250
but you know that'll maybe disrupt

413
00:16:13,339 --> 00:16:18,410
things if there's something going on hey

414
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:21,170
you know we do a bunch of monitoring of

415
00:16:18,410 --> 00:16:22,610
partners let's quickly go and see if

416
00:16:21,170 --> 00:16:26,300
there's any additional monitoring we can

417
00:16:22,610 --> 00:16:29,779
add in order to to be even more vigilant

418
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:32,000
than we normally are and then as things

419
00:16:29,779 --> 00:16:33,759
unfold a little bit more there's reports

420
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,319
that there's this specialized mini cats

421
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:37,730
that this bad actor is using and so of

422
00:16:36,319 --> 00:16:39,290
course let's go deploy a signature

423
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:42,709
looking for that and making sure that we

424
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:44,029
block it and so the you know these are

425
00:16:42,709 --> 00:16:49,729
kind of some of the steps we're going

426
00:16:44,029 --> 00:16:53,360
through and and I'll say good news we

427
00:16:49,730 --> 00:16:54,620
were at a target and the and so ever

428
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:56,300
this turned out to be one of those

429
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:57,949
things where you spend a lot of energy

430
00:16:56,300 --> 00:17:00,139
going and thinking about something that

431
00:16:57,949 --> 00:17:04,789
didn't turn out to be a real issue for

432
00:17:00,139 --> 00:17:07,490
us but but what a great way to practice

433
00:17:04,789 --> 00:17:10,010
and what a great way to think about have

434
00:17:07,490 --> 00:17:11,750
we thought critically about the people

435
00:17:10,010 --> 00:17:14,179
in your supply chain and this is where I

436
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:15,859
just say again well maybe you've thought

437
00:17:14,179 --> 00:17:17,839
about this really hard maybe you haven't

438
00:17:15,859 --> 00:17:20,389
but I've talked to a lot of customers

439
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:22,520
who you know oh yeah yeah no we've got

440
00:17:20,390 --> 00:17:25,669
great security controls you know it's

441
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:27,339
awesome I mean yeah we have some we have

442
00:17:25,669 --> 00:17:29,750
some vendors that do some stuff for us

443
00:17:27,339 --> 00:17:30,980
yeah I mean like you know the couple of

444
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:32,929
them just you know manage our domain

445
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:35,929
controllers and you just you got to

446
00:17:32,929 --> 00:17:38,900
think about you know what is the risk of

447
00:17:35,929 --> 00:17:41,390
that and what is the blast radius if

448
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:43,460
something goes wrong and you should also

449
00:17:41,390 --> 00:17:45,290
say that a lot of this thinking it's

450
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:47,150
distinct but overlapping from how you

451
00:17:45,290 --> 00:17:48,399
might think about insider threat of

452
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:52,120
course there's no

453
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:54,400
real reason to think that you know a

454
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:56,050
partner an external partner is more or

455
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:58,720
less likely to be an insider than

456
00:17:56,050 --> 00:18:00,159
someone you hire but but anyway but I'm

457
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:02,080
not gonna go into insider although

458
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:04,030
that's also a fascinating topic just

459
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:06,159
note that some of the things you do the

460
00:18:04,030 --> 00:18:07,660
threat model the people and vendors in

461
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:08,740
your supply chain would also have

462
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:12,340
overlap and how you think about

463
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:15,520
defending against insiders so it's a

464
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:17,050
practical advice you know we talk a lot

465
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:18,610
about assuming breach I love that

466
00:18:17,050 --> 00:18:20,740
mentality I think you can't say it

467
00:18:18,610 --> 00:18:23,199
enough you know you got to just assume

468
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:26,170
that every asset you have whether it's a

469
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:27,670
human or a router or a piece of software

470
00:18:26,170 --> 00:18:29,679
you have to assume it's gonna get

471
00:18:27,670 --> 00:18:31,780
breached at some point and make sure

472
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:34,870
you're okay that you're satisfied that

473
00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:36,970
the that the damage will be tolerable if

474
00:18:34,870 --> 00:18:41,110
that happens and you have the right

475
00:18:36,970 --> 00:18:42,940
controls in place inventory all the

476
00:18:41,110 --> 00:18:45,669
things I was told not to call people

477
00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:48,480
things so I didn't call people things I

478
00:18:45,670 --> 00:18:51,040
just let's say inventory all of things

479
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:52,390
obviously policy governance I mentioned

480
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:53,649
automation I think this is another thing

481
00:18:52,390 --> 00:18:56,050
it's a small thing but it's things

482
00:18:53,650 --> 00:18:58,330
people don't thinking about enough you

483
00:18:56,050 --> 00:19:01,178
know especially in a large organization

484
00:18:58,330 --> 00:19:02,620
writing down a bunch of best practices

485
00:19:01,179 --> 00:19:04,809
and then thinking it will be followed

486
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:06,580
perfectly when it's executed thousands

487
00:19:04,809 --> 00:19:09,340
of times by employees across the company

488
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:11,139
and across the globe come on it's just

489
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:13,570
it's just a numbers game someone's gonna

490
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:15,370
mess up at some point and so you better

491
00:19:13,570 --> 00:19:17,320
not be relying on that alone you better

492
00:19:15,370 --> 00:19:19,270
have some other other thing and the more

493
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:21,520
you can automate that so that the tools

494
00:19:19,270 --> 00:19:24,070
and the systems don't allow deviation

495
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:25,900
from policy the better the safer you're

496
00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:28,030
gonna be principle of least privilege

497
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:30,400
obviously familiar concept in the

498
00:19:28,030 --> 00:19:32,620
security industry you know let's really

499
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:35,440
think about where you have to implant a

500
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:37,780
vendor or a partner what do they have

501
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:39,640
access to do they need access to all the

502
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:42,510
things that you by default give people

503
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:44,770
access to stuff like that where you can

504
00:19:42,510 --> 00:19:46,360
provide devices or make sure you're at

505
00:19:44,770 --> 00:19:48,460
least able to monitor every interaction

506
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:49,928
with your network this is really hard in

507
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:52,630
some of the use cases of vendors that

508
00:19:49,929 --> 00:19:54,370
come in to companies especially vendors

509
00:19:52,630 --> 00:19:57,220
that work across multiple companies

510
00:19:54,370 --> 00:19:58,959
there's there's the the physical cost

511
00:19:57,220 --> 00:20:01,810
side of it of can you just hand out

512
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:02,440
laptops like candy to your vendors that

513
00:20:01,810 --> 00:20:03,970
come along

514
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:05,350
but there's also just the pragmatic

515
00:20:03,970 --> 00:20:06,850
thing let's say someone is working at

516
00:20:05,350 --> 00:20:08,260
three or four companies is it reasonable

517
00:20:06,850 --> 00:20:10,240
to expect them to juggle three or four

518
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:11,650
laptops as they do that so there's some

519
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:14,470
complexity there but it's great if you

520
00:20:11,650 --> 00:20:16,800
can and of course any privileged access

521
00:20:14,470 --> 00:20:20,620
you need to have extra layers of control

522
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:23,740
so switch gears let's talk a little bit

523
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:27,129
about software you'll notice my

524
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:29,350
not-so-subtle size of turtles hardware

525
00:20:27,130 --> 00:20:31,110
is the smallest turtle and software and

526
00:20:29,350 --> 00:20:34,090
services and people or bigger turtles

527
00:20:31,110 --> 00:20:37,270
you can read into that whatever you like

528
00:20:34,090 --> 00:20:38,889
the so obviously there's software in our

529
00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:40,900
supply chains

530
00:20:38,890 --> 00:20:42,880
one really interesting example from

531
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:46,480
about a year ago a little over a year

532
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:48,270
ago we were there'd been rumblings in

533
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:52,240
the industry for a little while about

534
00:20:48,270 --> 00:20:54,129
about the CC cleaner actor and what

535
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:57,640
mechanisms and tactics they were using

536
00:20:54,130 --> 00:20:58,870
and there was some some some discussion

537
00:20:57,640 --> 00:21:01,030
about perhaps they were using some

538
00:20:58,870 --> 00:21:03,939
remote viewing software as part of that

539
00:21:01,030 --> 00:21:07,600
attack chain and then a vas published

540
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:09,400
this excellent our blog in April 2018

541
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:11,530
that went into a really thorough

542
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:14,470
breakdown of one particular attack in

543
00:21:11,530 --> 00:21:18,490
which according to Avast the TeamViewer

544
00:21:14,470 --> 00:21:19,510
remote viewing software was used and so

545
00:21:18,490 --> 00:21:21,130
this is pretty interesting

546
00:21:19,510 --> 00:21:25,260
obviously remote viewing software is

547
00:21:21,130 --> 00:21:27,670
something that makes most IT departments

548
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:29,379
freak out a little bit like it's kind of

549
00:21:27,670 --> 00:21:34,510
kind of one of them were scary things

550
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:37,210
you might have in your environment so so

551
00:21:34,510 --> 00:21:39,790
what did we do again we mobilize and

552
00:21:37,210 --> 00:21:41,530
said well you know do we have TeamViewer

553
00:21:39,790 --> 00:21:43,210
in the environment you know we don't

554
00:21:41,530 --> 00:21:45,520
have evidence that we don't know that

555
00:21:43,210 --> 00:21:48,700
it's real but let's go do the analysis

556
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:52,450
see if it's real and and see what would

557
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:53,890
happen and so again we've got you know

558
00:21:52,450 --> 00:21:56,350
an inventory of software in our

559
00:21:53,890 --> 00:21:58,030
environment so we can quickly go and say

560
00:21:56,350 --> 00:21:59,530
yeah okay there's some team you're in

561
00:21:58,030 --> 00:22:02,440
the environment let's go see where that

562
00:21:59,530 --> 00:22:04,090
TeamViewer is you know there's obviously

563
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:07,060
more and less sensitive parts of

564
00:22:04,090 --> 00:22:08,320
everyone's network and so you know

565
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:11,200
there's some places where people are

566
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:12,939
using TeamViewer and of course as the as

567
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:14,830
the security team it's not always

568
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:15,750
obvious why they're using something and

569
00:22:14,830 --> 00:22:17,490
so you know you

570
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:20,220
try to have that conversation to figure

571
00:22:17,490 --> 00:22:21,960
out a situation like this where it

572
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:23,310
wasn't oh my god an emergency where you

573
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:25,290
had to do something you know immediately

574
00:22:23,310 --> 00:22:26,960
you have the time to go explore a little

575
00:22:25,290 --> 00:22:28,889
bit because you want to balance

576
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:31,860
theoretical security and business

577
00:22:28,890 --> 00:22:33,120
disruption and so so you'll have some of

578
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:35,370
those conversations and some of them are

579
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:37,020
you know simple innocuous things and

580
00:22:35,370 --> 00:22:39,300
kind of you know okay that's not really

581
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:40,889
a big deal and then as we explore a

582
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:43,080
little bit we realize oh interesting

583
00:22:40,890 --> 00:22:45,300
there's there's some employees who are

584
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:47,490
interacting with this stuff and they're

585
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:49,409
interacting with third-party hardware

586
00:22:47,490 --> 00:22:51,600
suppliers third in our that are in our

587
00:22:49,410 --> 00:22:53,400
hardware supply chain and we say oh

588
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:55,199
that's interesting and then we go talk

589
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:57,690
to those employees and they say oh yeah

590
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:59,310
I mean the that's what the vendor uses

591
00:22:57,690 --> 00:23:00,720
and so you know when sometimes we have

592
00:22:59,310 --> 00:23:02,190
to debug stuff and so we get together

593
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:05,070
and we kind of do that we said well

594
00:23:02,190 --> 00:23:08,790
that's kind of interesting so so now

595
00:23:05,070 --> 00:23:10,710
we're talking about both you know a risk

596
00:23:08,790 --> 00:23:14,490
inside of our turtle and a risk inside

597
00:23:10,710 --> 00:23:16,590
of the turtle underneath us and and and

598
00:23:14,490 --> 00:23:20,970
it for me at least this was the first

599
00:23:16,590 --> 00:23:23,899
time it raised the question how far do

600
00:23:20,970 --> 00:23:27,450
you get to mandate policy and governance

601
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:29,850
do I get to tell one of my suppliers you

602
00:23:27,450 --> 00:23:31,230
shouldn't use a piece of software you

603
00:23:29,850 --> 00:23:32,730
know well how about the supplier of that

604
00:23:31,230 --> 00:23:34,170
supplier and how about the supplier of

605
00:23:32,730 --> 00:23:36,360
the supplier of that supplier like how

606
00:23:34,170 --> 00:23:38,460
far does it go and I think for me this

607
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:41,520
is this is one of the ones that made me

608
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:44,270
start thinking about hey you know how do

609
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:46,290
we get past this kind of at times

610
00:23:44,270 --> 00:23:49,950
adversarial relationship between

611
00:23:46,290 --> 00:23:51,840
suppliers and customers and move to a

612
00:23:49,950 --> 00:23:53,700
true partnership where we're having a

613
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:55,889
common dialogue about shared risk

614
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:57,650
because at the end of the day we're all

615
00:23:55,890 --> 00:24:05,430
in this together

616
00:23:57,650 --> 00:24:09,960
so so in our case in this situation we

617
00:24:05,430 --> 00:24:13,350
said look you know there's really no

618
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:15,030
reason why the normal information

619
00:24:13,350 --> 00:24:17,310
workers who are using this need to be

620
00:24:15,030 --> 00:24:19,680
using this kind of remote remote viewing

621
00:24:17,310 --> 00:24:22,379
software we have other alternatives that

622
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:25,770
would work just as well so let's just be

623
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:29,040
safe update our policies and go ahead

624
00:24:25,770 --> 00:24:33,230
and block access to to that stuff

625
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:35,760
and and then in dialogues with the

626
00:24:33,230 --> 00:24:38,340
hardware suppliers we had a similar kind

627
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:41,640
of conversation where we said hey you

628
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:44,669
know let's just be safe and at least for

629
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:47,630
this part of our ecosystem let's let's

630
00:24:44,670 --> 00:24:50,340
you know move to some alternatives and

631
00:24:47,630 --> 00:24:51,990
the and there's so there's a couple of

632
00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:57,149
interesting things about this one all

633
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:59,100
say is the the notifications to

634
00:24:57,150 --> 00:25:02,960
employees because again you know this

635
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:02,959
wasn't a fire drill this was a a

636
00:25:03,110 --> 00:25:07,260
important investigation that we're

637
00:25:05,370 --> 00:25:08,580
treating seriously but it wasn't oh my

638
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:12,840
god we got a stop there's a you know

639
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:17,070
there's a bear loose let's fix that so

640
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:18,750
the so you got to communicate to your

641
00:25:17,070 --> 00:25:21,990
employees because you can't just block

642
00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:27,000
access to a tool and not expect them to

643
00:25:21,990 --> 00:25:30,450
scream right so and so then imagine you

644
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:33,030
know you sent sending a notification to

645
00:25:30,450 --> 00:25:35,520
a bunch of employees at a large company

646
00:25:33,030 --> 00:25:37,620
you know you basically a large company

647
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:39,750
say anything you send to more than five

648
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:43,169
people if it's interesting we'll hit the

649
00:25:39,750 --> 00:25:44,880
media and you start thinking about if we

650
00:25:43,170 --> 00:25:47,370
send a thing to a bunch of employees

651
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:48,480
that says hey we suspect that there

652
00:25:47,370 --> 00:25:50,370
might be a problem with Team Viewer

653
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:52,890
we're banning it from our environment

654
00:25:50,370 --> 00:25:56,010
you know it'll be three minutes until

655
00:25:52,890 --> 00:25:57,960
that's in the media and now what we're

656
00:25:56,010 --> 00:26:01,860
basically doing if we do that is

657
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:04,590
throwing a partner under the bus based

658
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:06,030
on a suspicion of a problem and then you

659
00:26:04,590 --> 00:26:10,560
start thinking about the feeding frenzy

660
00:26:06,030 --> 00:26:12,930
that comes when that kind of media

661
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:15,990
article comes out and like how is that

662
00:26:12,930 --> 00:26:18,870
helpful to anybody and so but then if

663
00:26:15,990 --> 00:26:20,910
you don't say hey we suspect there's a

664
00:26:18,870 --> 00:26:23,370
problem how do you write the mail to the

665
00:26:20,910 --> 00:26:27,720
to the employees explaining that you're

666
00:26:23,370 --> 00:26:30,300
not just evil i T who on a whim makes

667
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:32,040
their job harder which of course is if

668
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:34,409
you pull the average information worker

669
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:36,629
the Job Description they think that

670
00:26:34,410 --> 00:26:40,920
security people in IT have is make their

671
00:26:36,630 --> 00:26:41,430
jobs harder and so you know we did our

672
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:42,750
best

673
00:26:41,430 --> 00:26:44,850
we learned some things from

674
00:26:42,750 --> 00:26:48,080
but it was kind of a challenging thing

675
00:26:44,850 --> 00:26:51,360
and I'd say the more you think about

676
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:52,889
I'll say proactive security and the more

677
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:54,209
you think about supply chain them we're

678
00:26:52,890 --> 00:26:56,640
likely you're gonna stumble across

679
00:26:54,210 --> 00:26:59,220
situations where you're gonna take a

680
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:02,820
measure that's precautionary and you

681
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:04,440
can't really always explain all the

682
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:07,580
reasons why you're taking that measure

683
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:10,170
without causing collateral damage

684
00:27:07,580 --> 00:27:11,970
downstream and I think if you embrace

685
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:14,100
the fact that we're all in this together

686
00:27:11,970 --> 00:27:16,350
we're all a bunch of Turtles trying to

687
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:19,050
do the right thing how we treat the

688
00:27:16,350 --> 00:27:22,949
other Turtles above and below us really

689
00:27:19,050 --> 00:27:28,800
matters and so we've got to think about

690
00:27:22,950 --> 00:27:31,890
that as an industry think here's some

691
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:33,620
practical advice for software in your

692
00:27:31,890 --> 00:27:37,260
supply chain this is a kind of checklist

693
00:27:33,620 --> 00:27:40,860
that we use inside a Microsoft when

694
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:42,840
we're evaluating software fairly

695
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:45,120
straightforward fairly basic but it's

696
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:47,760
been helpful I think in in helping us

697
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:49,290
think about this you know lots of people

698
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:51,629
do some of the stuff I'll call it -

699
00:27:49,290 --> 00:27:53,670
things that don't seem to be standard

700
00:27:51,630 --> 00:27:57,390
that I think need to be standard one is

701
00:27:53,670 --> 00:27:59,940
the contract side how many of you in

702
00:27:57,390 --> 00:28:03,210
every contract with every single

703
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:06,150
supplier that you have have terms about

704
00:28:03,210 --> 00:28:10,010
what you expect them to do if they have

705
00:28:06,150 --> 00:28:12,150
a security incident that affects you a

706
00:28:10,010 --> 00:28:13,620
lot of the people I talked to who are

707
00:28:12,150 --> 00:28:16,230
very good at security and take this very

708
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:17,189
seriously haven't thought about that or

709
00:28:16,230 --> 00:28:18,570
they've thought about it but it's

710
00:28:17,190 --> 00:28:20,970
inconsistent it's in some of their

711
00:28:18,570 --> 00:28:22,710
contracts and not the others boy you

712
00:28:20,970 --> 00:28:24,120
know I'd love to live in a world where

713
00:28:22,710 --> 00:28:26,280
we could just trust everyone to do the

714
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:27,810
right thing but it's really nice to have

715
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:29,490
contracts be clear about what your

716
00:28:27,810 --> 00:28:31,260
expectations are in a partner

717
00:28:29,490 --> 00:28:32,520
relationship and so I think that's

718
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:33,900
something that I'd really recommend you

719
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:35,370
take a look at if you haven't already

720
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:37,470
and make it part of your standard

721
00:28:35,370 --> 00:28:39,419
language we have at Microsoft we have

722
00:28:37,470 --> 00:28:41,490
standard boilerplate stuff that's in

723
00:28:39,420 --> 00:28:43,080
every contract and the systems are

724
00:28:41,490 --> 00:28:46,320
designed so you can't do a contract

725
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:49,020
without that stuff and so you know we

726
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:51,379
feel good about having that there even

727
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:53,639
though it is a lot of work to go do that

728
00:28:51,380 --> 00:28:55,620
the second thing people don't always do

729
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:56,730
is they think of this kind of assessment

730
00:28:55,620 --> 00:28:59,580
of software is be

731
00:28:56,730 --> 00:29:01,799
one time thing cool you looked at the

732
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:03,240
software and evaluated the risk a month

733
00:29:01,799 --> 00:29:05,820
ago six months ago twelve months ago

734
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:08,309
eighteen months ago when you gonna look

735
00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:09,090
at it again are you paying attention to

736
00:29:08,309 --> 00:29:14,250
the landscape

737
00:29:09,090 --> 00:29:16,610
do you have t.i out listening first are

738
00:29:14,250 --> 00:29:20,970
you listening for stuff it's just about

739
00:29:16,610 --> 00:29:22,830
your assets your direct assets or are

740
00:29:20,970 --> 00:29:26,250
you listening for potential issues

741
00:29:22,830 --> 00:29:30,960
across your extended ecosystem you

742
00:29:26,250 --> 00:29:32,250
should do the latter and and so there's

743
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:33,960
a pragmatic thing here you know you

744
00:29:32,250 --> 00:29:35,850
can't reassess something every five

745
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:38,580
minutes right but you got to figure out

746
00:29:35,850 --> 00:29:41,340
the right periodicity and you got to

747
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:43,139
figure out then what you do if you find

748
00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:45,590
a problem and this is another place

749
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:49,260
where I'd ask people to think about

750
00:29:45,590 --> 00:29:51,330
turtling all together and that's that if

751
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:53,220
our reaction when someone has a problem

752
00:29:51,330 --> 00:29:53,730
is not never can do business for you

753
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:56,370
anymore

754
00:29:53,730 --> 00:29:59,760
pretty soon not gonna be very many

755
00:29:56,370 --> 00:30:01,799
turtles in the universe but if our

756
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:03,690
reaction is what happened let's work

757
00:30:01,799 --> 00:30:05,309
with you and of course if someone's not

758
00:30:03,690 --> 00:30:07,350
taking us seriously that's one thing if

759
00:30:05,309 --> 00:30:08,520
someone's taking it seriously resolving

760
00:30:07,350 --> 00:30:09,840
the issue then I think that's a

761
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:12,418
different kind of conversation so

762
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:15,809
something to think about let's talk

763
00:30:12,419 --> 00:30:19,049
about services now you know obviously

764
00:30:15,809 --> 00:30:20,970
it's a little bit artificial to separate

765
00:30:19,049 --> 00:30:22,950
software and services because in a lot

766
00:30:20,970 --> 00:30:27,179
of cases these things are blended and

767
00:30:22,950 --> 00:30:28,470
blended services today but but I think

768
00:30:27,179 --> 00:30:30,480
another thing I've stumbled across

769
00:30:28,470 --> 00:30:32,040
talking to a lot of customers is a lot

770
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:35,760
of people have really good programs in

771
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:37,799
place for software installed on their

772
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:39,809
corporate devices and they're like

773
00:30:37,799 --> 00:30:41,960
awesome buttoned up just really have

774
00:30:39,809 --> 00:30:45,660
that figured out and we have no idea

775
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:48,630
what API is they're touching in various

776
00:30:45,660 --> 00:30:49,080
parts of their company hmm that could be

777
00:30:48,630 --> 00:30:51,929
a problem

778
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:56,070
so do you inventory every single service

779
00:30:51,929 --> 00:30:57,270
that you that you use how fast if you

780
00:30:56,070 --> 00:30:58,918
hear there's a problem with the service

781
00:30:57,270 --> 00:31:00,620
how fast can you figure out what the

782
00:30:58,919 --> 00:31:03,419
impact is to your company

783
00:31:00,620 --> 00:31:05,668
have you thought broadly enough about

784
00:31:03,419 --> 00:31:08,909
what services might mean this is a

785
00:31:05,669 --> 00:31:10,620
non-exhaustive five minute list of what

786
00:31:08,909 --> 00:31:13,590
you might think of as both upstream

787
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:17,000
and downstream dependencies when it

788
00:31:13,590 --> 00:31:19,590
comes to services what would happen if

789
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:22,620
you heard your PGI solution had a

790
00:31:19,590 --> 00:31:24,659
problem what would you do if one of your

791
00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:26,159
push networks that you were using for

792
00:31:24,660 --> 00:31:28,890
some part of your business had a problem

793
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:30,420
are you prepared for that have your

794
00:31:28,890 --> 00:31:36,710
threat model bit do you have a response

795
00:31:30,420 --> 00:31:43,700
plan you probably should oh oh yeah whoo

796
00:31:36,710 --> 00:31:55,400
technology come on Oh technology AV

797
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:58,290
lifeguard help Oh magic yeah what's that

798
00:31:55,400 --> 00:32:00,690
blackout oh I clicked a blackout button

799
00:31:58,290 --> 00:32:06,450
on the clicker it's user error that's

800
00:32:00,690 --> 00:32:12,080
fantastic yeah no there's still room for

801
00:32:06,450 --> 00:32:14,970
user error even in supply chain okay so

802
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:18,800
so what happens here's a great example

803
00:32:14,970 --> 00:32:21,270
of services supply chain for us so in

804
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:23,220
late 2018 there was this awesome

805
00:32:21,270 --> 00:32:25,530
TechCrunch article that was highlighting

806
00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:27,870
the work of a security researcher who

807
00:32:25,530 --> 00:32:32,280
discovered that there was this database

808
00:32:27,870 --> 00:32:37,919
of stuff that had was exposed this

809
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:40,590
configuration errors and the and and of

810
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:42,120
and so this goes public and in the

811
00:32:40,590 --> 00:32:44,459
TechCrunch article they were nice enough

812
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:47,010
to call out that it looked like there

813
00:32:44,460 --> 00:32:48,990
was some Microsoft data in you know in

814
00:32:47,010 --> 00:32:51,059
and amongst 25 million records of a

815
00:32:48,990 --> 00:32:53,070
bunch of other stuff and so of course we

816
00:32:51,059 --> 00:32:55,860
say thank you so much for ruining my

817
00:32:53,070 --> 00:32:59,159
weekend we'll be happy to go and

818
00:32:55,860 --> 00:33:01,290
investigate this so what's the first

819
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:03,090
thing we did we look at the data and to

820
00:33:01,290 --> 00:33:06,000
evaluate the risk turns out what we

821
00:33:03,090 --> 00:33:09,480
realized very quickly is that this

822
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:12,510
company Vox sauce Vox aux is a sub

823
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:16,440
processor of a bunch of telco sort SMS

824
00:33:12,510 --> 00:33:19,440
providers and so they do you know

825
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:21,540
aggregation and did I do the blackout

826
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:23,880
thing again no ok just maybe I won't

827
00:33:21,540 --> 00:33:27,940
touch this as much

828
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:34,540
you clearly can't be trusted I look you

829
00:33:27,940 --> 00:33:36,430
can't blame that on me the okay and and

830
00:33:34,540 --> 00:33:37,810
so they you know connect with all the

831
00:33:36,430 --> 00:33:41,980
complicated telco stuff that I don't

832
00:33:37,810 --> 00:33:43,480
understand and and so what we became

833
00:33:41,980 --> 00:33:46,450
worried about when we looked at it is

834
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:50,050
one of the primary use cases for us of

835
00:33:46,450 --> 00:33:52,240
this is the one time codes that get sent

836
00:33:50,050 --> 00:33:54,040
from our identity system in various

837
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:55,660
scenarios and so one of those examples

838
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:57,280
is you reset your password

839
00:33:55,660 --> 00:33:58,900
you know you sends you a code to the

840
00:33:57,280 --> 00:34:01,420
registered phone on your device if you

841
00:33:58,900 --> 00:34:03,310
choose and you enter that code and get

842
00:34:01,420 --> 00:34:05,050
in now there's different scenarios where

843
00:34:03,310 --> 00:34:07,570
we do this and in some of these

844
00:34:05,050 --> 00:34:09,400
scenarios the code is good you know for

845
00:34:07,570 --> 00:34:11,590
15 minutes and in other scenarios it's

846
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:14,470
good for a little bit longer but we kind

847
00:34:11,590 --> 00:34:16,480
of said Wow well if someone got a hold

848
00:34:14,469 --> 00:34:18,069
of one of those you know we got of

849
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:21,360
course other systems in place to help

850
00:34:18,070 --> 00:34:21,360
protect but that could be a really big

851
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:30,880
I'm gonna wiggle the cord oh wow okay

852
00:34:29,290 --> 00:34:37,750
you know that could be a big deal

853
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:41,620
so what do we do we're gonna power

854
00:34:37,750 --> 00:34:44,350
through it's gonna be great okay so so

855
00:34:41,620 --> 00:34:45,639
what do we do you know the first thing

856
00:34:44,350 --> 00:34:47,440
of course we do is we go expire all

857
00:34:45,639 --> 00:34:52,330
those tokens so any of they're still

858
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:54,670
valid we go expire we go look and see if

859
00:34:52,330 --> 00:34:56,500
there's any evidence of attempted logins

860
00:34:54,670 --> 00:34:58,300
or successful logins that are in any way

861
00:34:56,500 --> 00:35:00,820
suspicious because of course that would

862
00:34:58,300 --> 00:35:02,380
we don't know at this point you know was

863
00:35:00,820 --> 00:35:03,970
it just this was the security researcher

864
00:35:02,380 --> 00:35:05,230
the first person to find this stuff or

865
00:35:03,970 --> 00:35:06,490
is someone else found this miss

866
00:35:05,230 --> 00:35:08,350
configuration have been taking advantage

867
00:35:06,490 --> 00:35:13,600
of it and so we go and do the

868
00:35:08,350 --> 00:35:16,390
investigation and and luckily you know

869
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:18,069
no misuse had happened and so we were

870
00:35:16,390 --> 00:35:20,020
able to quickly kind of resolve this and

871
00:35:18,070 --> 00:35:22,420
say that's good but again it's one of

872
00:35:20,020 --> 00:35:24,580
these things that lets you test it you

873
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:25,960
really how good is your inventory how

874
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:28,120
good are you at knowing where these

875
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:31,120
things happen and here's the other the

876
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:32,710
critical element about this Vox ox

877
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:35,500
doesn't have a relationship with

878
00:35:32,710 --> 00:35:36,940
Microsoft there's several layers down in

879
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:38,730
the supply chain so

880
00:35:36,940 --> 00:35:41,980
you know we have pretty good inventory

881
00:35:38,730 --> 00:35:43,839
but we don't have a recursive inventory

882
00:35:41,980 --> 00:35:47,010
all the way through the supply chain I

883
00:35:43,839 --> 00:35:49,990
mean no one can that's impossible and so

884
00:35:47,010 --> 00:35:51,460
so how do we know to be listening to

885
00:35:49,990 --> 00:35:53,410
this and what can we do differently

886
00:35:51,460 --> 00:35:56,980
isn't in its industry to help manage

887
00:35:53,410 --> 00:36:03,368
this risk-taking the controller in my

888
00:35:56,980 --> 00:36:10,839
hand okay oh whoa there we go

889
00:36:03,369 --> 00:36:16,660
went too far okay so let's talk about

890
00:36:10,839 --> 00:36:19,150
what's now jumping hardware so let's

891
00:36:16,660 --> 00:36:20,589
talk about IOT and I think again lots of

892
00:36:19,150 --> 00:36:22,060
people have talked about IOT risk and

893
00:36:20,589 --> 00:36:24,849
said we need to take this more seriously

894
00:36:22,060 --> 00:36:26,650
as an industry and IOT devices or you

895
00:36:24,849 --> 00:36:28,060
know grow in leaps and bounds and

896
00:36:26,650 --> 00:36:29,500
there's gonna be more of them and there

897
00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:34,299
are pebbles on the beach or something

898
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:35,500
like that and so and I agree with that I

899
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:37,030
think we do need to take it more

900
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:40,180
seriously as an industry and I think

901
00:36:37,030 --> 00:36:41,530
again for most companies thinking about

902
00:36:40,180 --> 00:36:43,060
defending themselves you'd be better off

903
00:36:41,530 --> 00:36:45,369
thinking than a lot of time thinking

904
00:36:43,060 --> 00:36:47,200
about the IOT IOT you have and what

905
00:36:45,369 --> 00:36:49,480
controls you have in place then worrying

906
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:51,669
about things like chip masking so what

907
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:53,800
happened here is in April our threat

908
00:36:51,670 --> 00:36:59,109
intelligence center which we call mystic

909
00:36:53,800 --> 00:37:02,410
because of course acronyms and mystic

910
00:36:59,109 --> 00:37:04,089
tracks advanced actors kind of that

911
00:37:02,410 --> 00:37:06,879
might be targeting Microsoft customers

912
00:37:04,089 --> 00:37:09,400
or Microsoft in some way and so they saw

913
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:11,079
some suspicious activity from an actor

914
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:13,450
that we call strontium we really like

915
00:37:11,079 --> 00:37:15,760
element names other people like to talk

916
00:37:13,450 --> 00:37:16,930
about animals or numbers or things like

917
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:19,300
that

918
00:37:16,930 --> 00:37:24,490
and so you could just say you know

919
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:27,250
strontium is somewhat fancy and the and

920
00:37:24,490 --> 00:37:28,839
so we mobilized to say oh so so mystic

921
00:37:27,250 --> 00:37:30,220
track to this activity and it was

922
00:37:28,839 --> 00:37:31,779
targeting several of our of our

923
00:37:30,220 --> 00:37:33,669
customers and we said well we don't like

924
00:37:31,780 --> 00:37:36,550
that let's reach out to those customers

925
00:37:33,670 --> 00:37:37,869
and see you know what whether they're

926
00:37:36,550 --> 00:37:39,640
aware or what they're doing and what we

927
00:37:37,869 --> 00:37:41,829
can do so we start investigating with

928
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:42,940
these customers and what becomes pretty

929
00:37:41,829 --> 00:37:46,930
clear through the course of the

930
00:37:42,940 --> 00:37:49,520
investigation is there's some a set of

931
00:37:46,930 --> 00:37:51,200
IOT devices that were involved in this

932
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:53,210
the entry into some of these networks

933
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:55,339
was a video decoding device that was

934
00:37:53,210 --> 00:37:56,930
sitting on the network edge it had been

935
00:37:55,340 --> 00:37:58,550
installed and someone had forgotten to

936
00:37:56,930 --> 00:38:02,450
change the default username and password

937
00:37:58,550 --> 00:38:06,350
okay once you get a foothold start

938
00:38:02,450 --> 00:38:09,890
network scanning moving around the bad

939
00:38:06,350 --> 00:38:11,720
actor moves to avoid phones that are

940
00:38:09,890 --> 00:38:13,040
embedded in a couple of places as well

941
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:14,509
as some office printers that are

942
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:18,290
embedded in a couple of places and I

943
00:38:14,510 --> 00:38:20,660
will note don't think you're clever and

944
00:38:18,290 --> 00:38:22,759
think there's anything to read into

945
00:38:20,660 --> 00:38:26,480
about the pictures that are in this

946
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:33,190
slide they are generic 3d art from

947
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:35,690
PowerPoint and so anyway hopefully that

948
00:38:33,190 --> 00:38:41,180
that is not necessary because you know

949
00:38:35,690 --> 00:38:43,390
we're all in this together but so so the

950
00:38:41,180 --> 00:38:45,290
actor moves through the environment and

951
00:38:43,390 --> 00:38:47,509
really they took advantage of a

952
00:38:45,290 --> 00:38:50,630
combination of misconfigurations and in

953
00:38:47,510 --> 00:38:52,010
one case a previous previously disclosed

954
00:38:50,630 --> 00:38:55,310
vulnerability in one of these devices

955
00:38:52,010 --> 00:38:57,380
and there was one patch missing and that

956
00:38:55,310 --> 00:38:59,660
the actor was able to exploit they also

957
00:38:57,380 --> 00:39:01,550
looked around for service accounts and

958
00:38:59,660 --> 00:39:04,520
this is an increasingly common tactic

959
00:39:01,550 --> 00:39:06,560
that we see actors doing kind of across

960
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:09,740
our ecosystem as more and more people

961
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:11,240
kind of lock down user accounts actors

962
00:39:09,740 --> 00:39:13,040
think that moving to service accounts is

963
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:14,509
a way to kind of evade detection and of

964
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:17,029
course I know this is a technical

965
00:39:14,510 --> 00:39:20,090
audience but service accounts which are

966
00:39:17,030 --> 00:39:21,200
often used for automation you know you

967
00:39:20,090 --> 00:39:23,600
don't have the human on the other side

968
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:24,919
so you can't do traditional MFA and

969
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:27,799
things like that there are things you

970
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:29,990
can do to lock them down but and so we

971
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:32,210
saw this actor doing this stuff working

972
00:39:29,990 --> 00:39:33,770
with these companies we were able to

973
00:39:32,210 --> 00:39:35,390
quickly kind of shut it down and block

974
00:39:33,770 --> 00:39:36,560
it but there's a couple of things that I

975
00:39:35,390 --> 00:39:39,440
think we're really interesting about

976
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:41,359
this and and the first is just that you

977
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:43,850
know hey this isn't particularly

978
00:39:41,359 --> 00:39:46,910
sophisticated and you know I've been in

979
00:39:43,850 --> 00:39:48,799
lots of meetings like this or outside of

980
00:39:46,910 --> 00:39:50,509
conference rooms like this where at

981
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:53,600
times as an industry we kind of her a

982
00:39:50,510 --> 00:39:55,369
little snobbish and we say I mean come

983
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:58,040
on they didn't change the username and

984
00:39:55,369 --> 00:39:59,570
password and you know okay that's fair

985
00:39:58,040 --> 00:40:03,290
that's something that people should do

986
00:39:59,570 --> 00:40:05,300
but but at the same time you can also

987
00:40:03,290 --> 00:40:06,890
say why do we have devices that don't

988
00:40:05,300 --> 00:40:08,360
require you to change that stuff when

989
00:40:06,890 --> 00:40:11,120
you install it can't we design this

990
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:13,490
stuff better as an industry you know why

991
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:15,589
why is patching hard especially for IOT

992
00:40:13,490 --> 00:40:18,140
devices it can be really tricky to

993
00:40:15,590 --> 00:40:19,670
actually patch these devices couldn't we

994
00:40:18,140 --> 00:40:21,830
do more as an industry to make it just

995
00:40:19,670 --> 00:40:24,320
automatic and easy for patching to

996
00:40:21,830 --> 00:40:28,130
happen like there's a lot we can do to

997
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:31,340
be better and more than that if we're

998
00:40:28,130 --> 00:40:35,090
all in this together you know how do we

999
00:40:31,340 --> 00:40:38,570
let how do we not let these kinds of

1000
00:40:35,090 --> 00:40:40,700
simple Mis configuration issues get used

1001
00:40:38,570 --> 00:40:42,980
over and over and over by adversaries

1002
00:40:40,700 --> 00:40:44,540
and so one of the things we did in the

1003
00:40:42,980 --> 00:40:48,770
in the kind of towards the end of this

1004
00:40:44,540 --> 00:40:50,450
investigation is we said look someone

1005
00:40:48,770 --> 00:40:51,920
not I had the bright idea we should

1006
00:40:50,450 --> 00:40:53,089
reach out and talk to these vendors

1007
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:56,630
about this and let them know what

1008
00:40:53,090 --> 00:40:58,940
happened and kind of the first

1009
00:40:56,630 --> 00:41:00,980
responsibles well I mean but it's not a

1010
00:40:58,940 --> 00:41:03,740
we've have common vulnerability

1011
00:41:00,980 --> 00:41:05,780
disclosure and but that's for zero days

1012
00:41:03,740 --> 00:41:07,339
and this isn't a zero day it's just miss

1013
00:41:05,780 --> 00:41:10,130
configuration and maybe some design

1014
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:11,600
feedback you know and we gotta go back

1015
00:41:10,130 --> 00:41:14,810
and forth and kind of said but look like

1016
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:16,910
this is an advanced actor like I would

1017
00:41:14,810 --> 00:41:18,529
want to know if an advanced actor was

1018
00:41:16,910 --> 00:41:20,149
using my technology I would want to

1019
00:41:18,530 --> 00:41:22,250
think about there's anything I can do to

1020
00:41:20,150 --> 00:41:23,720
make my technology better because I care

1021
00:41:22,250 --> 00:41:26,600
about my customers and I wanted to be

1022
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:29,029
successful and so so we reached out and

1023
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:30,920
it was awesome their reaction was

1024
00:41:29,030 --> 00:41:32,360
awesome the conversation was awesome and

1025
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:33,950
I think that they don't they'll go and

1026
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:35,300
take this stuff seriously and make it

1027
00:41:33,950 --> 00:41:38,419
make changes that make their products

1028
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:40,220
better but that's three how many tens of

1029
00:41:38,420 --> 00:41:42,020
thousands of IOT devices are out there

1030
00:41:40,220 --> 00:41:44,990
and so the point here is it's not about

1031
00:41:42,020 --> 00:41:47,180
the devices these particular devices

1032
00:41:44,990 --> 00:41:49,819
it's not about the actor it's about how

1033
00:41:47,180 --> 00:41:52,910
we operate as an industry and are we

1034
00:41:49,820 --> 00:41:55,040
making us or making concerted efforts to

1035
00:41:52,910 --> 00:41:58,220
make us all better and make the actors

1036
00:41:55,040 --> 00:42:01,820
work harder this is why flickering

1037
00:41:58,220 --> 00:42:03,350
really annoying the we blogged about

1038
00:42:01,820 --> 00:42:05,960
this on Monday there's a bunch of more

1039
00:42:03,350 --> 00:42:08,060
details in the blog here's a simple

1040
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:12,920
script that the actor dropped on these

1041
00:42:08,060 --> 00:42:16,549
devices I've got the next slide if it

1042
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:18,460
goes to the next slide no too much

1043
00:42:16,550 --> 00:42:22,750
[Music]

1044
00:42:18,460 --> 00:42:22,750
okay we're gonna change the adapter I

1045
00:42:25,180 --> 00:42:28,520
have a link to the blog on the next

1046
00:42:27,260 --> 00:42:31,370
slide and of course the slides will be

1047
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:33,530
on will be posted on the blackout site

1048
00:42:31,370 --> 00:42:34,790
so I encourage people to read the blog

1049
00:42:33,530 --> 00:42:37,280
there's more details in the blog about

1050
00:42:34,790 --> 00:42:39,890
the specific things we saw the actor do

1051
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:42,020
and would love to hear from people if as

1052
00:42:39,890 --> 00:42:43,700
you go hunt in your environment if you

1053
00:42:42,020 --> 00:42:45,530
see any signs of this actor or these

1054
00:42:43,700 --> 00:42:48,830
techniques it would be great to know was

1055
00:42:45,530 --> 00:42:50,570
the three or 300 times that this

1056
00:42:48,830 --> 00:42:57,970
adversary was able to reuse these

1057
00:42:50,570 --> 00:42:57,970
tactics all right technology

1058
00:43:06,510 --> 00:43:10,069
but now hold on

1059
00:43:12,630 --> 00:43:15,590
oh come on

1060
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:21,640
we go back to the other adapter sorry

1061
00:43:19,369 --> 00:43:21,640
folks

1062
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:47,440
okay well now we can see that and it

1063
00:43:45,070 --> 00:43:50,950
won't let me swap that's awesome let's

1064
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:52,380
try one more okay you see what I'm

1065
00:43:50,950 --> 00:43:57,460
seeing

1066
00:43:52,380 --> 00:43:59,820
now you see my daughter alright so she's

1067
00:43:57,460 --> 00:43:59,820
really cute

1068
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:06,820
okay so uh links on the blog more

1069
00:44:05,380 --> 00:44:09,610
details on blog check it out it's a

1070
00:44:06,820 --> 00:44:12,040
super cool all right so if you if you if

1071
00:44:09,610 --> 00:44:13,780
you backup as for things I want you to

1072
00:44:12,040 --> 00:44:19,420
take away from what I've talked about

1073
00:44:13,780 --> 00:44:21,250
today we got to share more and people do

1074
00:44:19,420 --> 00:44:22,750
it so it's not like I'm trying to stand

1075
00:44:21,250 --> 00:44:25,270
on the stage and say nobody ever does

1076
00:44:22,750 --> 00:44:28,690
this but I think is not the routine in

1077
00:44:25,270 --> 00:44:31,930
the industry to think about reaching out

1078
00:44:28,690 --> 00:44:36,100
and uplifting everybody else it's too

1079
00:44:31,930 --> 00:44:38,529
easy to have tactics of adversaries get

1080
00:44:36,100 --> 00:44:42,130
shared at the speed of the second drink

1081
00:44:38,530 --> 00:44:43,900
at the next conference not shared in

1082
00:44:42,130 --> 00:44:46,690
real time or close to real time as

1083
00:44:43,900 --> 00:44:51,310
they're happening and we got to make the

1084
00:44:46,690 --> 00:44:53,310
adversaries work harder we can it's

1085
00:44:51,310 --> 00:44:56,290
actually not that hard and you know what

1086
00:44:53,310 --> 00:45:00,960
we've made amazing progress as an

1087
00:44:56,290 --> 00:45:04,720
industry with zero days these days

1088
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:08,350
thanks to amazing work from hundreds if

1089
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:10,390
not thousands of companies a lot of the

1090
00:45:08,350 --> 00:45:14,020
time if an advanced actor uses a

1091
00:45:10,390 --> 00:45:18,900
zero-day once it gets burned it gets

1092
00:45:14,020 --> 00:45:18,900
patched and so they hold them sparingly

1093
00:45:19,230 --> 00:45:26,320
but there's all these other ways and the

1094
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:28,510
adversaries are not dumb they're smart

1095
00:45:26,320 --> 00:45:29,890
and so why would you spend the expensive

1096
00:45:28,510 --> 00:45:37,870
thing if you can spend the cheap thing

1097
00:45:29,890 --> 00:45:39,460
to get into your target so how can we

1098
00:45:37,870 --> 00:45:42,100
share more I think the problem is

1099
00:45:39,460 --> 00:45:43,900
culture and I think we have to embrace

1100
00:45:42,100 --> 00:45:46,410
it and talk more seriously about the

1101
00:45:43,900 --> 00:45:48,850
fact that our culture has problems

1102
00:45:46,410 --> 00:45:51,670
there's a piece of this is media I

1103
00:45:48,850 --> 00:45:52,630
already kind of touched on this name and

1104
00:45:51,670 --> 00:45:56,860
shame is too strong

1105
00:45:52,630 --> 00:45:58,900
give it's not helpful it drives the

1106
00:45:56,860 --> 00:46:02,320
wrong behavior it makes it hard for

1107
00:45:58,900 --> 00:46:05,110
companies to talk and share and help the

1108
00:46:02,320 --> 00:46:07,840
broader ecosystem ha but the meat is an

1109
00:46:05,110 --> 00:46:10,270
amazing tool they're amazing partners in

1110
00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:13,090
this how can we get name and shame to

1111
00:46:10,270 --> 00:46:15,280
become learn and defend together how can

1112
00:46:13,090 --> 00:46:17,440
we make it a vehicle for communicating

1113
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:19,240
because the media is awesome at getting

1114
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:20,650
the message out about this is happening

1115
00:46:19,240 --> 00:46:23,410
and here's what you could take away from

1116
00:46:20,650 --> 00:46:24,700
that on the customer side too many

1117
00:46:23,410 --> 00:46:26,980
customers when they learn about an

1118
00:46:24,700 --> 00:46:28,720
incident their response is oh my God why

1119
00:46:26,980 --> 00:46:30,640
was there an issue I'm mad or I'm you

1120
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:34,270
know scared or I'm thinking about firing

1121
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:37,480
you or whatever and I look I mean it can

1122
00:46:34,270 --> 00:46:39,670
be stressful I get that but how do we

1123
00:46:37,480 --> 00:46:41,560
shift that to how did they respond what

1124
00:46:39,670 --> 00:46:44,020
are they doing you know was it

1125
00:46:41,560 --> 00:46:46,690
reasonable was a reasonable problem or

1126
00:46:44,020 --> 00:46:49,090
was it a not reasonable problem and are

1127
00:46:46,690 --> 00:46:50,890
they are they gonna get better on the

1128
00:46:49,090 --> 00:46:52,750
business side I think a lot of the

1129
00:46:50,890 --> 00:46:54,460
current culture is we have a problem

1130
00:46:52,750 --> 00:46:55,990
let's contain it and let's like make

1131
00:46:54,460 --> 00:46:58,240
sure we do everything in our power that

1132
00:46:55,990 --> 00:47:00,220
no one ever hears about it happening of

1133
00:46:58,240 --> 00:47:02,439
course that's counter productive how

1134
00:47:00,220 --> 00:47:04,480
does that turn from that to partnership

1135
00:47:02,440 --> 00:47:07,660
and transparency and then on disclosure

1136
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:09,490
side how do we zoom out and say you know

1137
00:47:07,660 --> 00:47:11,230
yeah code defects are a problem let's go

1138
00:47:09,490 --> 00:47:12,759
fix them let's talk about them but we do

1139
00:47:11,230 --> 00:47:14,950
a reasonably good job of that as an

1140
00:47:12,760 --> 00:47:16,690
industry how do we shift that from code

1141
00:47:14,950 --> 00:47:20,529
defects - look we're disclosing and

1142
00:47:16,690 --> 00:47:23,560
talking about stuff that works we see

1143
00:47:20,530 --> 00:47:24,820
you know I may have seen some of the

1144
00:47:23,560 --> 00:47:26,620
Microsoft folks walking around with

1145
00:47:24,820 --> 00:47:28,810
t-shirts that say passwords your

1146
00:47:26,620 --> 00:47:31,660
password doesn't matter enable MFA and

1147
00:47:28,810 --> 00:47:33,279
it's because and we blogged about this

1148
00:47:31,660 --> 00:47:35,980
pretty publicly password spray attacks

1149
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:38,800
are too effective in today's in today's

1150
00:47:35,980 --> 00:47:41,350
age the tech for this has been around

1151
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:43,900
for a long time and yet many people are

1152
00:47:41,350 --> 00:47:46,140
still victimized by this how do we help

1153
00:47:43,900 --> 00:47:46,140
them

1154
00:47:53,210 --> 00:47:58,099
response matters we focus more on how

1155
00:47:55,910 --> 00:48:01,160
people respond and less on whether they

1156
00:47:58,099 --> 00:48:02,569
had an incident because over a long

1157
00:48:01,160 --> 00:48:04,490
enough period of time everybody's gonna

1158
00:48:02,569 --> 00:48:09,050
have an incident or most people will and

1159
00:48:04,490 --> 00:48:10,279
so there's a different lens because

1160
00:48:09,050 --> 00:48:13,240
remember we're all in this together

1161
00:48:10,280 --> 00:48:16,069
and so just some best practices

1162
00:48:13,240 --> 00:48:18,680
regardless of which side of an incident

1163
00:48:16,069 --> 00:48:21,200
you're on whether you're the downstream

1164
00:48:18,680 --> 00:48:23,839
supplier or the person who's upstream

1165
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:27,500
who has a problem you know there's like

1166
00:48:23,839 --> 00:48:29,779
boy the gold standard is you discover

1167
00:48:27,500 --> 00:48:31,790
something and you go you tell your

1168
00:48:29,780 --> 00:48:33,530
customers proactively hey I discovered

1169
00:48:31,790 --> 00:48:35,779
this thing that impacts you here's what

1170
00:48:33,530 --> 00:48:38,660
I'm doing about it you know that's

1171
00:48:35,780 --> 00:48:41,420
awesome it definitely wouldn't advise

1172
00:48:38,660 --> 00:48:43,009
there are cases where someone discovers

1173
00:48:41,420 --> 00:48:44,720
something about one of their suppliers

1174
00:48:43,010 --> 00:48:46,130
and reaches out and says hey I think

1175
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:48,020
there might be a problem let's talk

1176
00:48:46,130 --> 00:48:50,569
about it I definitely wouldn't it by

1177
00:48:48,020 --> 00:48:51,980
saying you had I'm not sure I want to

1178
00:48:50,569 --> 00:48:54,380
know about that cuz then I'd have to

1179
00:48:51,980 --> 00:48:58,369
respond it's probably not a good

1180
00:48:54,380 --> 00:49:00,500
response you know we can engage more

1181
00:48:58,369 --> 00:49:03,319
transparently transparently and without

1182
00:49:00,500 --> 00:49:05,540
defensive miss and then the other thing

1183
00:49:03,319 --> 00:49:08,390
is you know more and more as we talk

1184
00:49:05,540 --> 00:49:09,980
about this stuff and as we compare notes

1185
00:49:08,390 --> 00:49:12,348
what you'll see is places where someone

1186
00:49:09,980 --> 00:49:13,940
has a problem it's very reasonable to

1187
00:49:12,349 --> 00:49:17,119
say oh I saw I've read about this

1188
00:49:13,940 --> 00:49:19,339
problem in tech a and you have something

1189
00:49:17,119 --> 00:49:20,720
kind of like that are you susceptible to

1190
00:49:19,339 --> 00:49:22,730
that same kind of problem and how you

1191
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:24,230
respond to that matters and being

1192
00:49:22,730 --> 00:49:25,579
willing to kind of say okay yeah sure

1193
00:49:24,230 --> 00:49:27,200
let me talk you through what controls we

1194
00:49:25,579 --> 00:49:28,430
have in place and what we're doing to

1195
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:29,990
make sure that's not a problem

1196
00:49:28,430 --> 00:49:31,040
and then you know kind of finally

1197
00:49:29,990 --> 00:49:34,490
learning from mistakes let's

1198
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:36,890
differentiate a reasonable mistake that

1199
00:49:34,490 --> 00:49:39,078
they learned from from repeated patterns

1200
00:49:36,890 --> 00:49:44,680
of mistakes which i think is a different

1201
00:49:39,079 --> 00:49:46,640
thing we got a sweat the small stuff

1202
00:49:44,680 --> 00:49:49,490
adversaries will find the path of least

1203
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:52,098
resistance we know that we see it every

1204
00:49:49,490 --> 00:49:56,500
day and yet we're not mobilizing as an

1205
00:49:52,099 --> 00:50:00,440
industry around that core truth and

1206
00:49:56,500 --> 00:50:02,900
finally embrace the whole it's not just

1207
00:50:00,440 --> 00:50:04,940
hardware it's not just software it's the

1208
00:50:02,900 --> 00:50:06,859
whole thing every one of you has a

1209
00:50:04,940 --> 00:50:08,869
different network to defend

1210
00:50:06,859 --> 00:50:11,808
every one of you has a different risk

1211
00:50:08,869 --> 00:50:13,249
profile so no one can really say this is

1212
00:50:11,809 --> 00:50:14,719
the right way or the wrong way to do it

1213
00:50:13,249 --> 00:50:16,609
without understanding the exact

1214
00:50:14,719 --> 00:50:19,069
environment but I hope that you're

1215
00:50:16,609 --> 00:50:20,949
thinking across all these dimensions and

1216
00:50:19,069 --> 00:50:23,479
being really intentional and deliberate

1217
00:50:20,949 --> 00:50:28,160
about where you spend your time and

1218
00:50:23,479 --> 00:50:31,399
finally I hope that while the turtle

1219
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:33,140
metaphor is a little silly I hope you

1220
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:36,079
think a little bit about how you can

1221
00:50:33,140 --> 00:50:37,939
help the turtle next to you and we're

1222
00:50:36,079 --> 00:50:40,130
all in this together and thanks a lot

1223
00:50:37,939 --> 00:50:43,529
for the time and the energy and the work

1224
00:50:40,130 --> 00:50:49,689
you do as part of my supply chain Thanks

1225
00:50:43,530 --> 00:50:49,689
[Applause]
