1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,500
good morning welcome to project zero

2
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:07,289
five days of making zero days hard in

3
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:10,170
Southeast CDF with Ben Hawkes before we

4
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:11,670
begin I have a few brief notes stop by

5
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:13,799
the business hall located in Mandalay

6
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:15,660
Bay Oceanside and shoreline ballrooms on

7
00:00:13,799 --> 00:00:16,590
level 2 during the day and for the

8
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:19,439
Welcome Reception

9
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:21,720
at 5:30 tonight the blackhead arsenal is

10
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:24,750
in the business call on level 2 lunch

11
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:28,259
will be served in Bayside Bayside a B

12
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:30,240
from 1 p.m. until 2:30 p.m. and don't

13
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:31,920
forget the merchandise store on level 2

14
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:32,519
thank you for putting your phones on

15
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:34,980
vibrate

16
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:36,630
it makes us easy it makes it easier for

17
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:47,760
the rest of us to ignore the ringing

18
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:50,280
then it's all yours oh that's cool great

19
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:53,579
slide there right so I need to like log

20
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:57,210
into my machine this is what you get for

21
00:00:53,579 --> 00:00:59,969
using a Linux desktop in 2019 how's that

22
00:00:57,210 --> 00:01:02,190
yeah well my name is Ben hooks and I'm

23
00:00:59,969 --> 00:01:04,320
the team lead for Google project zero

24
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:06,479
and it's great to be back on the

25
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:09,419
blackhat stage the last time I spoke at

26
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:11,600
blackhat was in 2008 and I was talking

27
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:15,330
about attacking the Windows Vista heap

28
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:18,030
and a lots changed since then we still

29
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:20,970
have heap exploits unfortunately but now

30
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:23,189
we also have Google project zero and

31
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:25,650
this is a presentation called projects

32
00:01:23,189 --> 00:01:28,979
there are five years of make sure they

33
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:31,170
had and indeed we're celebrating the

34
00:01:28,979 --> 00:01:33,479
fifth anniversary of the public

35
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:35,460
announcement of project zero this is the

36
00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:37,740
wired article that launched at all

37
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:39,990
between a great shot of our intern the

38
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:43,619
time Gio Hearts doing his mr. cool

39
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:46,048
impression much respect and so project

40
00:01:43,619 --> 00:01:49,950
zero is Google's applied security

41
00:01:46,049 --> 00:01:51,960
research team it was created in 2014 by

42
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:53,520
Chris Evans with a lot of help from

43
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:56,130
Travis or Mindy and many others and

44
00:01:53,520 --> 00:02:00,270
Google security team we've been

45
00:01:56,130 --> 00:02:03,420
discussing this problem of zero day so

46
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:05,280
zero day is a vulnerability and exploits

47
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:07,170
that an attacker knows about that the

48
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:10,169
defenders and the public does not know

49
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:12,840
about and we had a sense for many many

50
00:02:10,169 --> 00:02:13,899
years leading up to 2014 the zero day

51
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:16,510
was an important

52
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:19,299
problem for companies like Google but

53
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:22,510
also for society as a whole we had seen

54
00:02:19,299 --> 00:02:26,409
sort of a shift an increasing demand for

55
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:28,540
a zero-day not for the purpose of

56
00:02:26,409 --> 00:02:30,129
defense but for the purpose of audience

57
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:32,048
and we thought that we could do

58
00:02:30,129 --> 00:02:35,950
something about this and quickly

59
00:02:32,049 --> 00:02:39,730
coalesced around this mission make

60
00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:41,200
zero-day hard and within the statement

61
00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:42,819
make sure they had this sort of an

62
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:45,488
implied meaning that we believe that

63
00:02:42,819 --> 00:02:48,129
zero day is too cheap and too numerous

64
00:02:45,489 --> 00:02:50,409
in proportion to the capability that

65
00:02:48,129 --> 00:02:53,319
allows you in capability when we think

66
00:02:50,409 --> 00:02:54,638
of zero day we think of an attack that

67
00:02:53,319 --> 00:02:58,230
is very difficult to detect

68
00:02:54,639 --> 00:03:00,760
there's highly reliable and that works

69
00:02:58,230 --> 00:03:04,450
in the affected target there's no patch

70
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:07,090
for this issue so after five years the

71
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:09,310
the the obvious question to ask is zero

72
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:11,079
day hard yet

73
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:13,510
I suspect you might be able to guess the

74
00:03:11,079 --> 00:03:15,760
answer but I'll leave you in suspense

75
00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:17,230
for for some time before we consider

76
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:20,290
build up the framework of what we're

77
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:21,429
actually talking about here so here's a

78
00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:24,340
brief outline of what we're going to

79
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:26,470
talk about today I want to start with

80
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:31,389
some founding principles for project

81
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:34,599
zero these are for ideas that in our

82
00:03:31,389 --> 00:03:36,159
day-to-day life we as a team refer back

83
00:03:34,599 --> 00:03:38,078
to time and time again when making

84
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:40,269
decisions and I wanted to start here

85
00:03:38,079 --> 00:03:41,769
with the principles of shit the mission

86
00:03:40,269 --> 00:03:43,659
move on to principles to give you a

87
00:03:41,769 --> 00:03:45,430
sense of our team identity for what

88
00:03:43,659 --> 00:03:46,929
we're all about and for each one I'll

89
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:48,669
sort of talk a little bit about what the

90
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:50,440
principle is and then give you an

91
00:03:48,669 --> 00:03:55,599
example of how this manifests for

92
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:57,609
project zero good defense requires a

93
00:03:55,599 --> 00:04:00,310
detailed knowledge of offense this is a

94
00:03:57,609 --> 00:04:01,810
very well-known principle in insecurity

95
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:04,989
as with the idea of like red teaming or

96
00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:06,940
pentesting comes from and it manifests

97
00:04:04,989 --> 00:04:09,459
for project zero in the sense that we

98
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:11,260
wanted to create a pipeline of work that

99
00:04:09,459 --> 00:04:13,329
resembles or mimics what the real

100
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:15,399
attacker would do when creating a

101
00:04:13,329 --> 00:04:17,590
zero-day exploit so we perform

102
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:19,298
vulnerability research and exploit

103
00:04:17,589 --> 00:04:21,599
development in much the same fashion

104
00:04:19,298 --> 00:04:24,549
that the real attacker would want to and

105
00:04:21,599 --> 00:04:26,620
would like to pursue we're really just

106
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:27,750
adding one additional step to that that

107
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:29,790
pipeline of work

108
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:31,920
whereas instead of plugging the exploit

109
00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:34,500
into an implant we tend to stop their

110
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:36,750
study the exploit and in really reason

111
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:38,040
about what does this exploit telling us

112
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:39,600
about defense

113
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:41,610
what sort of long-term structural

114
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:43,020
improvements could we derive from

115
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:46,650
understanding this attack in this

116
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:47,609
exploit moving on attackers target the

117
00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:50,489
weakest link in the chain

118
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:53,850
another classic principle very familiar

119
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:58,500
to this room for us this manifests in

120
00:04:53,850 --> 00:05:00,330
terms of target scope so we had a lot of

121
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:02,550
experience by performing product

122
00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:04,440
security reviews at a launch time basis

123
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:06,180
so when Google was creating products and

124
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:09,180
services they would go through a

125
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:11,190
security review and an innovation of

126
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:13,920
project zeroes is that we consciously

127
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:16,430
detached from lunchtime product security

128
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:19,290
reviews and really started to try to

129
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:21,570
align our priorities with attacking

130
00:05:19,290 --> 00:05:23,850
interests in attack of priorities so we

131
00:05:21,570 --> 00:05:25,200
wanted to be working on the same

132
00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:27,840
problems that an attack was interested

133
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:29,729
in the logical conclusion of that is

134
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:31,500
that we're not just going to look at

135
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:34,230
Google software but we're going to look

136
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:36,030
at all software that both Google our

137
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:39,570
partners and our users are relying on

138
00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:41,700
that's Chrome or Android of course or

139
00:05:39,570 --> 00:05:44,790
other open source project projects or a

140
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:49,740
software from Apple or Microsoft or any

141
00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:52,050
other number of important vendors moving

142
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:54,600
on this is number three openness

143
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:57,180
benefits defenders more than a benefits

144
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:59,190
attackers and now we start to give into

145
00:05:57,180 --> 00:06:01,590
a concept or an idea that might be

146
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:04,830
familiar to many many of you but is

147
00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:07,469
perhaps less universally accepted this

148
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:09,810
is something that we have arrived at

149
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:12,419
after many years of experience doing

150
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:15,000
security work and something that we hold

151
00:06:12,419 --> 00:06:18,210
to be we hold to be true in the vast

152
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:20,490
majority of cases and manifests for

153
00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:22,469
project zero in the sense that we really

154
00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:25,290
have a focus on transparency that we

155
00:06:22,470 --> 00:06:28,020
want to share our results with as many

156
00:06:25,290 --> 00:06:29,850
people as possible with the public with

157
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:31,950
vendors and to give as much information

158
00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:34,500
about that work into the hands of as

159
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:35,760
many people as possible and we'll talk a

160
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:37,200
little bit over the course of this

161
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:40,050
presentation about some of the

162
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:41,580
subtleties of why we think this leads to

163
00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:44,460
a better defense of

164
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:46,380
output rather than in attackers with

165
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:49,919
some sort of sophisticated attacks and

166
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:52,200
how it's a net benefit challenging

167
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:54,990
industry norms needs to improved

168
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:57,570
security and this really captures an

169
00:06:54,990 --> 00:06:59,970
essence of them patience or urgency this

170
00:06:57,570 --> 00:07:01,200
concept that over the years the security

171
00:06:59,970 --> 00:07:04,650
industry has built up a lot of

172
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:06,960
assumptions and a lot of norms and we

173
00:07:04,650 --> 00:07:09,270
think that it's healthy to respectfully

174
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:11,880
challenge some of these assumptions for

175
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:14,070
the modern age the idea that many of the

176
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:16,409
concepts or ideas that were built up

177
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:19,440
over the past few decades

178
00:07:16,410 --> 00:07:21,420
some of them will hold true and stand up

179
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:23,190
to scrutiny and remain with us for many

180
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:25,710
years to come but some of them are now

181
00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:30,570
outdated and we want to constantly

182
00:07:25,710 --> 00:07:32,280
strive towards models and and decision

183
00:07:30,570 --> 00:07:34,469
making frameworks they're in the best

184
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:36,330
interest of user security based on the

185
00:07:34,470 --> 00:07:39,840
reality of how attackers are actually

186
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:41,630
operating in the modern world and so

187
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:44,000
hopefully that gives you some sense of

188
00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:46,980
what a team is like from an identity

189
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,720
perspective now I want to move on to

190
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:52,530
what the day-to-day life of project zero

191
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:54,930
is actually like one day soon we will

192
00:07:52,530 --> 00:07:56,070
get around to take in a team photo of'

193
00:07:54,930 --> 00:07:58,140
until that happens

194
00:07:56,070 --> 00:08:00,360
last year freezer at the the blackhat

195
00:07:58,140 --> 00:08:02,610
keynote used a group of kittens to

196
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:06,420
describe project zero I've gone for

197
00:08:02,610 --> 00:08:09,300
cyber matrix puppies this year stay

198
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:11,280
tuned for next year this is roughly

199
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:13,770
resembles the size of the team it

200
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:16,859
actually does feature Travis's puppy

201
00:08:13,770 --> 00:08:19,620
Dexter team mascot and then the rest of

202
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:21,870
the crew and so when I think of project

203
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:24,420
zero I'm a day-to-day basis what defines

204
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:26,570
our team operation the word autonomy

205
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:30,720
comes to mind most oftenly

206
00:08:26,570 --> 00:08:33,179
so we're kind of all bound together by

207
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:36,360
the shared mission and these shared

208
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:38,069
principles that's where a very

209
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:41,760
independent collection of security

210
00:08:38,070 --> 00:08:44,430
researchers in alliance a formation of

211
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:45,960
independent researchers working in the

212
00:08:44,430 --> 00:08:52,079
same framework with the same principles

213
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:54,510
and mission and sort of a key innovation

214
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:55,350
is that researchers have a very high

215
00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:56,819
degree of Internet

216
00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:59,760
to freedom within our team the ability

217
00:08:56,820 --> 00:09:02,370
to pursue their own research agenda we

218
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:04,260
work in the model where and we sort of

219
00:09:02,370 --> 00:09:06,960
met on a yearly basis to define a broad

220
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:08,430
overall scope of project zero and in our

221
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:10,200
day to day basis our individual

222
00:09:08,430 --> 00:09:13,489
researchers we're really trusting them

223
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:16,500
to choose projects that have high impact

224
00:09:13,490 --> 00:09:19,740
and kind of as a as a research team

225
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:23,280
there is a fundamental so probabilistic

226
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:25,500
nature of our work we never quite know

227
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:27,839
when we're going to have a positive

228
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:29,790
result and find something really

229
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:31,740
important and so high degree of

230
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:34,319
flexibility means that we can constantly

231
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:36,000
shift between projects that we think

232
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:38,070
initially look promising and then

233
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,260
perhaps have to pivot into new areas and

234
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:42,420
so we have for example okay our team

235
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:46,050
wider chaos be more of a sketch rather

236
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:47,459
than a blueprint and so individually

237
00:09:46,050 --> 00:09:48,689
here are some of the sort of facets of

238
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:50,820
work that you might find yourself

239
00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:53,490
working on as a researcher and project

240
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:54,990
zero I think we're quite well known for

241
00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:56,640
the vulnerability research side of this

242
00:09:54,990 --> 00:10:00,110
work but in practice there are many

243
00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:02,490
other sort of aspects to perform in

244
00:10:00,110 --> 00:10:04,680
security research work at Google and

245
00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:07,650
within project zero now dive into sort

246
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:09,479
of a few of these I was told in no

247
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:11,699
uncertain terms I'm not allowed to use

248
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:13,770
any sort of management gimmicks and yet

249
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:15,180
somehow a world word cloud appears in

250
00:10:13,770 --> 00:10:17,730
the presentation not quite sure how that

251
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:19,500
happens couldn't couldn't resist and so

252
00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:22,220
one of the first questions related to

253
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:24,540
vulnerability researchers how do you

254
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:28,080
what what do you work on how do you

255
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:30,480
choose what to work on and this isn't a

256
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:31,620
perfect science remember that we're

257
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:33,840
trying to align with attack of

258
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:36,510
priorities and to work on what they are

259
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:39,180
also interested in working on it tends

260
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:42,480
to come from sort of different sources

261
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:43,890
of information leaks and and private

262
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:46,470
conversations we have with people in the

263
00:10:43,890 --> 00:10:48,210
private exploit market analysis of

264
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:50,760
zero-day exploits that get detected in

265
00:10:48,210 --> 00:10:53,150
the wild and all of us gives us as

266
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:55,140
somewhat of a picture of what sort of

267
00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:58,829
targets that an attacker might be

268
00:10:55,140 --> 00:11:00,510
interested in and I think above and

269
00:10:58,830 --> 00:11:02,610
beyond that one of the most important

270
00:11:00,510 --> 00:11:04,080
facets of how we do target selection and

271
00:11:02,610 --> 00:11:06,480
try to stay in line with attack of

272
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:08,880
priorities is using the experience and

273
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:11,250
expertise of our team members to have

274
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:13,530
particular value to really trust them

275
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:17,310
you might describe us into ish intuition

276
00:11:13,530 --> 00:11:18,959
or forecasting ability but we work

277
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:21,300
really hard to hire billion talented

278
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:22,980
people and we want to lean on their

279
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:24,540
expertise to make good decisions about

280
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:26,850
what to work on you can see here in

281
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:28,740
practice it's very mobile heavy very

282
00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:31,350
browser here be lots of sandbox escapes

283
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:33,060
of that nature that's a snapshot of what

284
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:36,170
we looked at and past five years and

285
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:39,300
naturally this will evolve over time and

286
00:11:36,170 --> 00:11:41,339
so the next sort of question we often

287
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:43,020
would get us in terms of how do you

288
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:47,360
actually perform vulnerability research

289
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:50,640
the methodologies that we're using and

290
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:52,140
primarily this is accounted by number of

291
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:54,090
bugs discovered we have a label on our

292
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:56,270
issue tracker that notes down which

293
00:11:54,090 --> 00:12:01,290
methodology is use most commonly

294
00:11:56,270 --> 00:12:03,840
primarily manual review is by number the

295
00:12:01,290 --> 00:12:05,550
largest or most common methodology used

296
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:09,060
this is like source code review or

297
00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:11,370
reverse engineering the binary and what

298
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:13,109
this tells me is that if you're coming

299
00:12:11,370 --> 00:12:14,730
into the industry and you're an industry

300
00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:16,560
and looking to pursue vulnerability

301
00:12:14,730 --> 00:12:18,060
research building up that core skill

302
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:20,369
sets have been able to reason about code

303
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:23,550
is still going to be a very important

304
00:12:20,370 --> 00:12:25,770
skill to have going forward the next

305
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:27,359
biggest bucket is is fuzzing it tends to

306
00:12:25,770 --> 00:12:29,210
be the project serious contribution

307
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:31,680
there's more in terms of like bespoke

308
00:12:29,210 --> 00:12:33,630
artisanal fuzzing as opposed to just

309
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:36,239
sort of taken the knowing tools and

310
00:12:33,630 --> 00:12:38,880
running them on the NAR and targets and

311
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:40,950
so a lot of that work is about surfacing

312
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:43,290
new ways to think about mutation and

313
00:12:40,950 --> 00:12:44,850
generations surfacey new ways to improve

314
00:12:43,290 --> 00:12:46,500
code coverage and so forth

315
00:12:44,850 --> 00:12:50,040
and in our smallest bucket here at

316
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:51,630
around eight point six percent is other

317
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:53,520
methodologies out of the manual review

318
00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:55,860
and fuzzing so things I static analysis

319
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:58,079
or program analysis advanced forms of

320
00:12:55,860 --> 00:13:01,020
binary instrumentation you might even

321
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:03,500
sort of put reading documentation into

322
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:06,120
that back and I'm not sure a myth

323
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:09,150
historically has been a smaller portion

324
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:11,130
of the overall output now one of the the

325
00:13:09,150 --> 00:13:13,230
key words to refer back to as autonomy

326
00:13:11,130 --> 00:13:14,970
there's no rules about which methodology

327
00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:17,490
to use when it's a very much an

328
00:13:14,970 --> 00:13:18,900
individual discretion of researchers and

329
00:13:17,490 --> 00:13:20,730
it tends to be that individual

330
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:22,500
researchers have a good sense of what

331
00:13:20,730 --> 00:13:26,370
types of methodologies work for them

332
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:29,940
it's a very personal decision and so

333
00:13:26,370 --> 00:13:32,280
part of performing bot ability research

334
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:33,870
is thinking about what is the most

335
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:36,150
effective methodology to use in any

336
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:38,550
given circumstance but also what new

337
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:41,120
methodologies could we create that we

338
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:43,260
haven't previously had access to and so

339
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:44,850
interspersing soms design and software

340
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:47,520
development work into a purely research

341
00:13:44,850 --> 00:13:50,430
focused role is a very effective way to

342
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:52,260
stable burnout and so we kind of skip

343
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:55,199
between a pure vulnerability research

344
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:56,640
operational research and what

345
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:59,430
traditional software development work

346
00:13:56,640 --> 00:14:02,220
and this methodology building idea is

347
00:13:59,430 --> 00:14:04,020
one area where myth where software

348
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:05,970
engineering comes in we are ultimately

349
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:08,189
however an applied security research

350
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:10,410
team and so the efficiency of that

351
00:14:08,190 --> 00:14:12,390
methodology is really important to us we

352
00:14:10,410 --> 00:14:14,910
want and that methodology either to find

353
00:14:12,390 --> 00:14:16,439
bugs faster than we currently are at the

354
00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:18,510
moment with our existing methodologies

355
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:20,820
or to surface bugs that we couldn't

356
00:14:18,510 --> 00:14:22,680
otherwise surface if it's doing one of

357
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:24,120
those two things it's probably quite

358
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:26,099
interesting and we've been a pursue it

359
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:27,570
further if it's not having one of those

360
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:29,540
buckets it might still show potential

361
00:14:27,570 --> 00:14:32,130
there's probably not going to be

362
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:36,180
highlighted and the graph that you saw

363
00:14:32,130 --> 00:14:38,040
previously is a significant factor okay

364
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:39,989
moving on so remember we have we talked

365
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:41,910
about a canonical pipeline of work where

366
00:14:39,990 --> 00:14:44,130
would perform vulnerability research to

367
00:14:41,910 --> 00:14:45,719
discover high-impact vulnerabilities in

368
00:14:44,130 --> 00:14:47,189
the software that we all rely on and

369
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:49,700
then for subsets of those

370
00:14:47,190 --> 00:14:51,630
vulnerabilities we write exploits and

371
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:53,940
there's a number of different reasons

372
00:14:51,630 --> 00:14:55,170
why we want to write an exploit sort of

373
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:57,090
one of the traditional reasons is to

374
00:14:55,170 --> 00:14:58,469
demonstrate the security impact of the

375
00:14:57,090 --> 00:15:00,780
vulnerability to make sure that that

376
00:14:58,470 --> 00:15:02,640
impact as well understood and sort of

377
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:05,699
related to that abstracting that idea

378
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:08,100
one step is to say that with a fixed bug

379
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:10,230
class and a fixed execution environment

380
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:12,870
if we write to exploit for that one

381
00:15:10,230 --> 00:15:15,750
instance with a net class it kind of

382
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:18,240
sets up an equivalence where all other

383
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:19,320
bugs in the same execution environment

384
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,780
they're going to be exploitable in the

385
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:23,000
same manner and that's really

386
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:25,110
interesting and important when we have

387
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,970
constantly changing execution

388
00:15:25,110 --> 00:15:28,650
environments is more mitigations are

389
00:15:26,970 --> 00:15:31,040
brought in and sandboxing is improved

390
00:15:28,650 --> 00:15:33,300
and so forth so establishing and a

391
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:34,920
generic understanding of which issues

392
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:35,790
are exploitable or not is is always

393
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:39,128
important

394
00:15:35,790 --> 00:15:40,329
we've also noticed that like rationally

395
00:15:39,129 --> 00:15:42,339
when you look at the vulnerability

396
00:15:40,329 --> 00:15:43,989
report you can make an assessment that

397
00:15:42,339 --> 00:15:47,019
this is important and could be

398
00:15:43,990 --> 00:15:48,670
exploitive but emotionally it's much

399
00:15:47,019 --> 00:15:50,740
harder to make that connection until you

400
00:15:48,670 --> 00:15:52,319
really see it live in action and so

401
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:54,850
creating that export we've found

402
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:57,910
harnesses some sort of energy that we

403
00:15:54,850 --> 00:16:00,100
think results in kind of a closer to

404
00:15:57,910 --> 00:16:01,389
optimal response for that vulnerability

405
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:03,220
that's in terms of response from a

406
00:16:01,389 --> 00:16:05,589
vendor certainly or an open-source

407
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:10,180
project but in terms of fixing the issue

408
00:16:05,589 --> 00:16:12,129
but also in terms of patch adoption so

409
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:14,559
and then there's kind of like a couple

410
00:16:12,129 --> 00:16:16,269
of other facets which feed into the next

411
00:16:14,559 --> 00:16:17,709
part of our pipeline which is that we

412
00:16:16,269 --> 00:16:20,740
won't study the exploits that we're

413
00:16:17,709 --> 00:16:24,579
creating to derive some sort of insights

414
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:26,230
which we can use to further long term

415
00:16:24,579 --> 00:16:28,719
structural improvements to software and

416
00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:30,279
hardware security export writing is a

417
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:32,379
creative pursuit and we're going to be

418
00:16:30,279 --> 00:16:34,029
creating new exploit techniques and we

419
00:16:32,379 --> 00:16:36,730
can share those techniques with vendors

420
00:16:34,029 --> 00:16:38,470
in the world to start to think about how

421
00:16:36,730 --> 00:16:41,050
to counter these particular techniques

422
00:16:38,470 --> 00:16:42,490
and indeed by writing an exploit you're

423
00:16:41,050 --> 00:16:44,589
really walking in the shoes of an

424
00:16:42,490 --> 00:16:46,569
attacker and you face the same types of

425
00:16:44,589 --> 00:16:49,269
anxieties that an attacker does when

426
00:16:46,569 --> 00:16:50,920
trying to write an exploit and there's

427
00:16:49,269 --> 00:16:53,279
an awful lot of luck involved in writing

428
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:55,569
an exploit and we get a sense from that

429
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:57,370
process of writing exploits of where we

430
00:16:55,569 --> 00:16:59,319
got a bit lucky where the exploit is a

431
00:16:57,370 --> 00:17:01,059
bit fragile and if things have been a

432
00:16:59,319 --> 00:17:02,949
little bit different in the environment

433
00:17:01,059 --> 00:17:07,270
that the attack might not have worked

434
00:17:02,949 --> 00:17:10,658
out as quite as well and so these last

435
00:17:07,270 --> 00:17:13,658
two points give us an insight into ideas

436
00:17:10,659 --> 00:17:15,280
concepts for structural change not just

437
00:17:13,659 --> 00:17:18,010
fixing an individual vulnerability

438
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:20,819
they're advocating for change that

439
00:17:18,010 --> 00:17:23,730
really makes a step improvement in

440
00:17:20,819 --> 00:17:26,109
defensive posture and event security

441
00:17:23,730 --> 00:17:27,970
here are some ideas that we're sort of

442
00:17:26,109 --> 00:17:29,678
commonly thinking about when I use this

443
00:17:27,970 --> 00:17:32,289
word structural change which will come

444
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:34,360
up often in this presentation attack

445
00:17:32,289 --> 00:17:37,179
surface reduction bit of sandbox in

446
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:38,830
exploit mitigations fixing the bug class

447
00:17:37,179 --> 00:17:40,750
are not just fixing an individual issue

448
00:17:38,830 --> 00:17:42,399
but finding the root cause of why does

449
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:44,950
that issue occur and in addressing the

450
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:49,549
root cause process improvements faster

451
00:17:44,950 --> 00:17:52,770
fixes releases and so forth and improved

452
00:17:49,549 --> 00:17:55,158
perhaps an API is hard to use and if we

453
00:17:52,770 --> 00:17:57,299
just describe a better documentation

454
00:17:55,159 --> 00:18:00,659
developers will be less likely to miss

455
00:17:57,299 --> 00:18:02,279
user and so we have many many insights

456
00:18:00,659 --> 00:18:04,440
another one our dead here is also

457
00:18:02,279 --> 00:18:09,059
enabling the security research community

458
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:11,520
to also do similar work that that we're

459
00:18:09,059 --> 00:18:14,520
interested in to build up a body of work

460
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:16,590
from an initial starting point a key

461
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:18,690
kind of observation here is the project

462
00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:21,389
zero tends to be in a position to

463
00:18:18,690 --> 00:18:22,919
advocate for change rather than to

464
00:18:21,390 --> 00:18:24,390
actually implement it or to be the

465
00:18:22,919 --> 00:18:26,480
decision-maker there are a few

466
00:18:24,390 --> 00:18:28,860
exceptions like we've done a lot of work

467
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:30,090
development work on Chrome and a Linux

468
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:32,010
kernel where we can be active

469
00:18:30,090 --> 00:18:33,539
participants nationally right there

470
00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:36,600
there's the structural improvements

471
00:18:33,539 --> 00:18:39,000
ourselves but for the most part a lot of

472
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:40,799
our job is about working out how to be

473
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,899
good advocates for change how to align

474
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:44,908
with what a vendor or with a open source

475
00:18:42,899 --> 00:18:46,918
project wants to achieve anyway and

476
00:18:44,909 --> 00:18:49,679
start to generate ideas that kind of

477
00:18:46,919 --> 00:18:54,029
match with a high permeability are going

478
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:56,700
to be adopted and so that gives you some

479
00:18:54,029 --> 00:18:58,710
sense of what the actual work that we do

480
00:18:56,700 --> 00:19:00,480
looks like and I think now it makes

481
00:18:58,710 --> 00:19:03,240
sense to dive in to some specific

482
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:05,010
examples of of the work that we've

483
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:08,580
actually done over the past five years

484
00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:10,230
going back into the archives here some

485
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:15,149
of us might be familiar some of it might

486
00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:16,200
be new here's the headline figures who

487
00:19:15,149 --> 00:19:17,820
would have known that you could have a

488
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:19,500
hundred million disclosure debates in

489
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:22,649
five years and yet somehow we managed to

490
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:26,039
achieve it we did not to look at these

491
00:19:22,649 --> 00:19:28,860
numbers too much though it tends to be

492
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:30,390
that counting the number of

493
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:31,529
vulnerabilities that you're finding or

494
00:19:30,390 --> 00:19:33,299
something isn't really clearly

495
00:19:31,529 --> 00:19:35,929
representative impact there's a bigger

496
00:19:33,299 --> 00:19:38,190
story here and so what I want to do is

497
00:19:35,929 --> 00:19:39,779
this is going to explain a little bit

498
00:19:38,190 --> 00:19:42,480
the structure of how we're going to talk

499
00:19:39,779 --> 00:19:44,070
about these projects on each slide we're

500
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:46,140
going to have a top half with kind of

501
00:19:44,070 --> 00:19:47,908
the result that we that we generated

502
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:49,950
within our work and within our research

503
00:19:47,909 --> 00:19:53,370
and on the bottom half we're going to

504
00:19:49,950 --> 00:19:55,020
have the consequences of that work so

505
00:19:53,370 --> 00:19:57,840
here's an obvious place to start

506
00:19:55,020 --> 00:20:00,539
specter and meltdown a CPU security

507
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:02,550
issue discovered in part by John Horhn

508
00:20:00,539 --> 00:20:04,710
and many other researchers was a

509
00:20:02,550 --> 00:20:06,389
bug collision where multiple researchers

510
00:20:04,710 --> 00:20:10,080
reported the same issue around the same

511
00:20:06,390 --> 00:20:11,670
time and this was an essence if you

512
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:13,470
really want to understand the typical

513
00:20:11,670 --> 00:20:17,970
details of go pursue yarn horns

514
00:20:13,470 --> 00:20:19,770
presentation at real-world crypto if if

515
00:20:17,970 --> 00:20:23,850
we can think about what this issue

516
00:20:19,770 --> 00:20:25,470
represented on paper it's like an

517
00:20:23,850 --> 00:20:27,870
information leak between across the

518
00:20:25,470 --> 00:20:29,960
security boundary but in practice it was

519
00:20:27,870 --> 00:20:32,879
kind of like a moment it really had a

520
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:34,920
shift an industry-wide shift in thinking

521
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:37,080
about how we approached and perceived

522
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:39,960
CPU security and some of the assumptions

523
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:41,100
that we have about how CPUs worked and

524
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:43,320
what sort of guarantees they were

525
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:45,709
providing we had to go back and question

526
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:48,060
them again this led to substantial

527
00:20:45,710 --> 00:20:49,800
architectural changes across every level

528
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:52,740
of the computing staff browsers

529
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:56,370
hypervisors kernels etc and we really

530
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:57,780
sure saw like a marked redoubling of

531
00:20:56,370 --> 00:21:00,330
effort within the heart with the

532
00:20:57,780 --> 00:21:02,520
hardware industry to invest in security

533
00:21:00,330 --> 00:21:04,860
to build up their security capabilities

534
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:08,129
and improve their processes and prove

535
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:10,800
their testing etc and so the cause was

536
00:21:08,130 --> 00:21:14,640
the discovery of CPU security issue and

537
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:17,370
the effect was industry-wide moving on

538
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:18,840
if you follow along with iOS kernel

539
00:21:17,370 --> 00:21:21,449
security research this was a very

540
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:24,300
popular finding it was a design for in

541
00:21:21,450 --> 00:21:26,670
the kernel the iOS and Mac OS users

542
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:29,610
which led to privilege escalation and

543
00:21:26,670 --> 00:21:31,410
essentially what in beer discovered was

544
00:21:29,610 --> 00:21:33,300
that every task a point where it's a

545
00:21:31,410 --> 00:21:35,580
core kernel structure with a potential

546
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:38,970
security vulnerability this is kind of a

547
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:40,770
unique response in a sense it took

548
00:21:38,970 --> 00:21:42,510
multiple iterations working with Apple

549
00:21:40,770 --> 00:21:45,210
to fix this issue directly certainly and

550
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:48,990
I took well over our standard 90 days to

551
00:21:45,210 --> 00:21:51,840
address but the end result wasn't just

552
00:21:48,990 --> 00:21:54,570
between a bug metrics in a bug class

553
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:56,250
itself and so that has a much more

554
00:21:54,570 --> 00:21:58,280
pervasive effect than just for some

555
00:21:56,250 --> 00:22:02,370
individual ability

556
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:04,290
another example flash so we performed a

557
00:22:02,370 --> 00:22:06,169
huge amount of vulnerability research on

558
00:22:04,290 --> 00:22:09,629
flash premiere primarily driven by

559
00:22:06,170 --> 00:22:11,880
Natalie and Matias lots of fuzzing lots

560
00:22:09,630 --> 00:22:14,790
of manual review and a huge number of

561
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:16,100
vulnerability discoveries and you might

562
00:22:14,790 --> 00:22:17,149
look at this this huge

563
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:18,799
number of vulnerabilities that we were

564
00:22:17,150 --> 00:22:20,720
finding and think like what's the point

565
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:22,760
there's just going to be 200 more after

566
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:25,190
all of that but it's what we coupled

567
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:27,440
this vulnerability research work with it

568
00:22:25,190 --> 00:22:30,080
really matters well I think fixing

569
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:32,390
vulnerabilities has impact on of itself

570
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:34,460
but combined with this other sort of

571
00:22:32,390 --> 00:22:36,200
slightly more behind-the-scenes work you

572
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:37,820
really start to see the full picture we

573
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:39,559
worked with collaborated with Adobe and

574
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:41,210
Microsoft to implement exploit

575
00:22:39,559 --> 00:22:45,020
mitigations to make some of the standard

576
00:22:41,210 --> 00:22:46,970
exploit techniques more challenging but

577
00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:49,340
aside from that we were also pursuing

578
00:22:46,970 --> 00:22:51,650
James Foster on our team he he

579
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:53,959
implemented an improved sandbox for

580
00:22:51,650 --> 00:22:56,510
flash in Chrome which at the time broke

581
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:58,970
the canonical exploit chain when we

582
00:22:56,510 --> 00:23:01,220
start the project zero in 2014 a flash

583
00:22:58,970 --> 00:23:03,169
exploit combined with the Windows kernel

584
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:06,020
exploit was ubiquitous we were seeing

585
00:23:03,169 --> 00:23:08,150
that time and time again and what we

586
00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:10,039
managed to do is producer it directly

587
00:23:08,150 --> 00:23:11,870
working alongside the Chrome security

588
00:23:10,039 --> 00:23:14,270
team shipped an improvement to the

589
00:23:11,870 --> 00:23:16,489
chrome sandbox which broke the canonical

590
00:23:14,270 --> 00:23:18,740
exploit chain and forced attackers to

591
00:23:16,490 --> 00:23:22,280
pursue a new shape of an exploit and

592
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:23,990
again working behind the scenes with

593
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:26,658
chrome and project managers in chrome we

594
00:23:23,990 --> 00:23:28,549
use the discussions generated by the

595
00:23:26,659 --> 00:23:31,460
huge volume of vulnerability research

596
00:23:28,549 --> 00:23:33,559
results to advocate for click-to-play

597
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:35,929
for flash and put in flash on the path

598
00:23:33,559 --> 00:23:38,299
towards deprecation I think those

599
00:23:35,929 --> 00:23:39,890
discussions were ongoing certainly but

600
00:23:38,299 --> 00:23:41,690
we hope helped to provide the data

601
00:23:39,890 --> 00:23:45,260
needed to assure that more than the

602
00:23:41,690 --> 00:23:47,600
timely manner you know on another

603
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:49,669
example kind of two different facets of

604
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:52,549
Windows empty engine which is Windows

605
00:23:49,669 --> 00:23:55,220
defenders back-end engine and W pad

606
00:23:52,549 --> 00:23:56,600
which is proxy auto-discovery again we

607
00:23:55,220 --> 00:23:58,309
noticed it was a higher level of

608
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:59,090
complexity in these systems than you

609
00:23:58,309 --> 00:24:01,010
might expect

610
00:23:59,090 --> 00:24:03,740
well this Tabitha did expect it

611
00:24:01,010 --> 00:24:05,840
certainly and we performed a degree of

612
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:08,510
vulnerability research we performed an

613
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:10,939
exploit development and what this is

614
00:24:08,510 --> 00:24:13,370
resulted in is sandboxes for both of

615
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:15,950
these attacks servers so you start to

616
00:24:13,370 --> 00:24:19,250
see a common sort of pattern here which

617
00:24:15,950 --> 00:24:20,809
leads to a side note you may well have

618
00:24:19,250 --> 00:24:21,890
heard of some of that research it tends

619
00:24:20,809 --> 00:24:24,260
to be the projects there is

620
00:24:21,890 --> 00:24:27,020
vulnerability researchers a very popular

621
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:29,090
very well-received and has a high

622
00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:29,889
visibility however the structural

623
00:24:29,090 --> 00:24:31,750
improvements the

624
00:24:29,890 --> 00:24:34,299
that happens as a consequence of the

625
00:24:31,750 --> 00:24:37,360
vulnerability research is generally not

626
00:24:34,299 --> 00:24:40,540
as visible to the security industry in

627
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:42,909
the security community and I just wanted

628
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:44,350
to take a very brief moment to speak to

629
00:24:42,910 --> 00:24:46,690
the vendors and speak to the open-source

630
00:24:44,350 --> 00:24:48,370
projects that are working with us on all

631
00:24:46,690 --> 00:24:50,410
of this very hard work on structural

632
00:24:48,370 --> 00:24:51,850
improvements to say we see you and we

633
00:24:50,410 --> 00:24:55,600
recognize that work and want to say

634
00:24:51,850 --> 00:24:57,909
thank you so here's one final example of

635
00:24:55,600 --> 00:25:00,309
canonical shape of the the vulnerability

636
00:24:57,910 --> 00:25:02,440
research exploit development structural

637
00:25:00,309 --> 00:25:05,350
improvements pipeline at Gallup in a

638
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:07,900
mini performed extended review of

639
00:25:05,350 --> 00:25:10,689
Broadcom the ubiquitous Wi-Fi chipset we

640
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:12,760
found many vulnerabilities then he wrote

641
00:25:10,690 --> 00:25:14,740
two different exploits food-chain

642
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:18,429
exploits for android and iOS

643
00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:22,150
essentially if you're on the same Wi-Fi

644
00:25:18,429 --> 00:25:24,610
ap is a target you can take over their

645
00:25:22,150 --> 00:25:26,290
device with these exploits on Android

646
00:25:24,610 --> 00:25:27,879
there was if you're a connoisseur of

647
00:25:26,290 --> 00:25:30,580
exploit development business certainly

648
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:32,169
very beautiful exploits we're talking

649
00:25:30,580 --> 00:25:34,750
about exploits in the Wi-Fi chip suit

650
00:25:32,169 --> 00:25:37,210
itself and then chaining another attack

651
00:25:34,750 --> 00:25:39,130
on to the actual CPU the application

652
00:25:37,210 --> 00:25:41,169
processor of the mobile device on

653
00:25:39,130 --> 00:25:43,090
Android that was a very direct path

654
00:25:41,169 --> 00:25:45,190
because there was no iron in you there's

655
00:25:43,090 --> 00:25:49,299
no compartmentalization between the

656
00:25:45,190 --> 00:25:51,370
chipset and the main CPU and on our iris

657
00:25:49,299 --> 00:25:53,889
we had a similar shape of an attack

658
00:25:51,370 --> 00:25:57,100
however iOS have implemented that which

659
00:25:53,890 --> 00:25:58,870
is a iron mu like system and we managed

660
00:25:57,100 --> 00:26:01,000
to find sort of a configuration and

661
00:25:58,870 --> 00:26:06,070
implementation for to bypass the island

662
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:08,320
mu and so we released a five-part blog

663
00:26:06,070 --> 00:26:10,030
series we released some tools and it was

664
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:13,840
a very well-received research project

665
00:26:10,030 --> 00:26:17,139
but things Rumble on and the effect

666
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:18,459
happens over time for Broadcom certainly

667
00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:20,260
we noticed an improvement in their

668
00:26:18,460 --> 00:26:22,320
downstream communication to telling

669
00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:25,570
their partners the people who are using

670
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:27,189
the chipset that they had the

671
00:26:25,570 --> 00:26:29,168
vulnerability that was about to be fixed

672
00:26:27,190 --> 00:26:32,020
that improved markedly they invested in

673
00:26:29,169 --> 00:26:34,270
search processes vulnerability response

674
00:26:32,020 --> 00:26:36,280
processors and started showing some

675
00:26:34,270 --> 00:26:37,840
technical approaches as well mitigations

676
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:41,320
on the actual firmware running on the

677
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:42,500
chipset and from about Windows I think

678
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:45,770
it really

679
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:46,790
had known conceptually that I ran amuse

680
00:26:45,770 --> 00:26:48,860
for an important part of

681
00:26:46,790 --> 00:26:51,200
compartmentalization but this really

682
00:26:48,860 --> 00:26:53,000
provided the data that motivated in the

683
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:55,040
case of Android motivated adoption of

684
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,790
some basic iommu and configuration of

685
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:58,520
the iommu

686
00:26:55,790 --> 00:27:00,350
and for iOS I think amid certain

687
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:03,110
implementation improvements to say that

688
00:27:00,350 --> 00:27:05,449
how its configured matters for

689
00:27:03,110 --> 00:27:07,820
researchers of course we want to get

690
00:27:05,450 --> 00:27:09,950
this the force multiplication effect of

691
00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:11,419
sharing our results with other public

692
00:27:09,950 --> 00:27:13,930
security researchers and we'd love to

693
00:27:11,420 --> 00:27:16,910
see the work that they they continue on

694
00:27:13,930 --> 00:27:19,540
there are our publications so this is a

695
00:27:16,910 --> 00:27:21,380
classic reshaped project for us

696
00:27:19,540 --> 00:27:23,810
vulnerability research exploit

697
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:26,030
development very high profile and then a

698
00:27:23,810 --> 00:27:28,000
set of structural improvements and it's

699
00:27:26,030 --> 00:27:29,840
hard to count really to precisely know

700
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:32,780
how many of these structural

701
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:34,850
improvements are consequence directly or

702
00:27:32,780 --> 00:27:36,520
projects areas work because we again are

703
00:27:34,850 --> 00:27:41,899
generally in a position to advocate

704
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:44,750
conservatively at least 15 but what does

705
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:47,960
this all mean how do we put it in

706
00:27:44,750 --> 00:27:51,770
context so we have this mission make

707
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:54,650
zero day hard the question is how do we

708
00:27:51,770 --> 00:27:57,379
measure the hard and make zero day hard

709
00:27:54,650 --> 00:27:59,270
perhaps every so often we hear about

710
00:27:57,380 --> 00:28:01,610
like the price of an exploit was sold

711
00:27:59,270 --> 00:28:03,080
for in the gray market if that that's

712
00:28:01,610 --> 00:28:04,729
going up maybe it's harder

713
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:06,110
perhaps it's the number of

714
00:28:04,730 --> 00:28:07,610
vulnerabilities that we're finding if

715
00:28:06,110 --> 00:28:08,479
we're finding this vulnerability surely

716
00:28:07,610 --> 00:28:10,250
something is more secure

717
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:13,820
or how many exploits have been detected

718
00:28:10,250 --> 00:28:16,610
in the wild well it turns out none of

719
00:28:13,820 --> 00:28:18,020
these satisfactory for a number of

720
00:28:16,610 --> 00:28:21,020
different reasons that the price of an

721
00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:23,330
exploit it depends on demand as much as

722
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:25,400
it does the actual cost or creating the

723
00:28:23,330 --> 00:28:28,070
exploit the number of vulnerabilities

724
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:29,720
well CVE counted has been to bunk'd many

725
00:28:28,070 --> 00:28:32,210
many times over has not been a good

726
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:34,790
measure of how secure and application is

727
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:36,860
and detection well the rate of detection

728
00:28:34,790 --> 00:28:38,540
tells me nothing about the rates of non

729
00:28:36,860 --> 00:28:40,699
detection so what do we really measure

730
00:28:38,540 --> 00:28:44,120
in there and so it turns out that's

731
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:46,160
quite a excuse upon hard problem to

732
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:47,540
define the heart and mixer they had the

733
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:50,120
section is all about how many times I

734
00:28:47,540 --> 00:28:53,570
can say that with hot we can make an

735
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:55,659
attempt to find something better

736
00:28:53,570 --> 00:28:57,909
none of these are

737
00:28:55,660 --> 00:29:00,970
quite as satisfying as would like either

738
00:28:57,910 --> 00:29:02,320
we start to at least talk about things

739
00:29:00,970 --> 00:29:04,120
that are perhaps more in line with

740
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:08,439
things that an attacker really cares

741
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:11,159
about so I want to reframe a little bit

742
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:14,200
the discussion and instead of measuring

743
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:18,340
what the state of a zero-day being hard

744
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:20,680
means step back one one one step and

745
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:23,080
look at what does progress towards hard

746
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:25,210
mean can we measure the progress towards

747
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:27,790
that goal rather than the goal itself

748
00:29:25,210 --> 00:29:32,020
the state have been in a world where it

749
00:29:27,790 --> 00:29:33,639
is hard and to me this is a how I've

750
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:35,560
been thinking about progress towards

751
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:37,120
hard recently and I'm happy to share it

752
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:39,129
just to generate debate and discussion

753
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:40,090
perhaps not everyone will agree for me I

754
00:29:39,130 --> 00:29:42,760
think about it

755
00:29:40,090 --> 00:29:45,459
requiring two different facets the first

756
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:47,560
is like for any given fixed target like

757
00:29:45,460 --> 00:29:50,170
we can take the Chrome browser for

758
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:52,480
example to do a browser attack combined

759
00:29:50,170 --> 00:29:55,900
with the sandbox escape we can repeat

760
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:59,140
that same exploit yeah upon year upon

761
00:29:55,900 --> 00:30:01,240
year in the case of Chrome we have data

762
00:29:59,140 --> 00:30:03,310
going back to about 2011 year upon year

763
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:05,560
upon year and we can see where the

764
00:30:03,310 --> 00:30:08,110
plateaus in the cost and difficulty of

765
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:10,780
creating an exploit are and whether the

766
00:30:08,110 --> 00:30:12,459
upward slopes are over time and from

767
00:30:10,780 --> 00:30:13,810
that we have a good sense of what's the

768
00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:17,230
difference between creating the exploit

769
00:30:13,810 --> 00:30:21,100
and 2011 versus 2019 and how much is

770
00:30:17,230 --> 00:30:22,930
that increase cost for an attacker but I

771
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:24,820
don't think that's quite enough if

772
00:30:22,930 --> 00:30:26,400
demand is increasing there such a rapid

773
00:30:24,820 --> 00:30:30,040
rate for these zero day exploits

774
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:33,310
probably attackers can swallow a certain

775
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:37,290
amount of their extra cost and pass it

776
00:30:33,310 --> 00:30:39,340
on to customers and I think kind of the

777
00:30:37,290 --> 00:30:41,530
additional factor that you need to

778
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:44,230
consider is that across those step

779
00:30:41,530 --> 00:30:46,600
changes of one particular type of

780
00:30:44,230 --> 00:30:49,360
exploit becoming more difficult does it

781
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:52,060
lead to a shift in the metagame for

782
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:54,330
attackers do they have to move on from a

783
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:57,220
Chrome browser exploit to something else

784
00:30:54,330 --> 00:31:00,010
to change the shape of an exploit a

785
00:30:57,220 --> 00:31:02,410
great example of vs. as we mentioned in

786
00:31:00,010 --> 00:31:04,780
2014 flash plus the Windows kernel was

787
00:31:02,410 --> 00:31:06,640
standard but we can't do flash bus the

788
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:08,740
Windows kernel anymore as attackers it's

789
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:09,700
not viable we have to shift the metagame

790
00:31:08,740 --> 00:31:11,890
tor

791
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:13,840
a renderer back in an IPC bug or

792
00:31:11,890 --> 00:31:16,570
something of that nature and so if we're

793
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:19,270
shifting the metagame at a high rate and

794
00:31:16,570 --> 00:31:20,830
if the time spent of building the

795
00:31:19,270 --> 00:31:22,240
equivalent exploit chain to an

796
00:31:20,830 --> 00:31:26,020
equivalent nibble of a reliability

797
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:28,030
that's a key detail is increasing then

798
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:32,170
we get a sense that we're progressing

799
00:31:28,030 --> 00:31:35,290
towards hard now I've dodged the

800
00:31:32,170 --> 00:31:37,750
question somewhat and you can think

801
00:31:35,290 --> 00:31:40,480
about the state of zero they've been

802
00:31:37,750 --> 00:31:43,330
hard in a very abstract sense in a non

803
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:46,510
measurable sense I think perhaps hard

804
00:31:43,330 --> 00:31:48,879
isn't described in relative terms that

805
00:31:46,510 --> 00:31:51,190
zero day is hard when given fixed

806
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:54,400
operational requirements the cost

807
00:31:51,190 --> 00:31:56,860
efficiency of using zero day is less

808
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:58,810
than other available methodologies like

809
00:31:56,860 --> 00:32:00,159
one day or a supply chain attacks or

810
00:31:58,810 --> 00:32:04,320
inside the risk or something of that

811
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:07,600
nature or perhaps you might think about

812
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:10,870
had zero day been in absolute terms that

813
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:12,790
of the sits globally of actors that want

814
00:32:10,870 --> 00:32:15,639
to maintain a zero day exploit

815
00:32:12,790 --> 00:32:17,889
capability only the top in percent in

816
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:19,750
terms of in terms of capability are

817
00:32:17,890 --> 00:32:23,110
actually able to do so and for you

818
00:32:19,750 --> 00:32:25,150
perhaps a 10% to zero I don't know but

819
00:32:23,110 --> 00:32:27,520
what seems clear to me neither of these

820
00:32:25,150 --> 00:32:30,250
again I would find fully satisfying but

821
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:33,940
I like to put this out there for the

822
00:32:30,250 --> 00:32:36,790
discussion what does seem clear to me

823
00:32:33,940 --> 00:32:37,300
from this if the state of zero day being

824
00:32:36,790 --> 00:32:38,950
hard

825
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:41,620
resembles anything even remotely like

826
00:32:38,950 --> 00:32:44,320
this then it's very unlikely that we're

827
00:32:41,620 --> 00:32:46,870
gonna be able to precisely know the

828
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:49,889
threshold point between zero days not

829
00:32:46,870 --> 00:32:52,389
being hard to zero days becoming hard I

830
00:32:49,890 --> 00:32:54,280
suspect we will note eventually that

831
00:32:52,390 --> 00:32:56,040
we've entered the state of of zero day

832
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:57,790
being hard I think that's going to have

833
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:59,200
artifacts and phenomenons that

834
00:32:57,790 --> 00:33:02,860
eventually we'll be able to figure it

835
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:04,870
out but the precise moment for any given

836
00:33:02,860 --> 00:33:07,709
target where we we make this their

837
00:33:04,870 --> 00:33:10,300
shoulders unlikely to be precisely non

838
00:33:07,710 --> 00:33:12,520
progress towards hard I think is

839
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:16,600
miserable in a meaningful way and so

840
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:18,910
that is sort of a key place that we can

841
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:20,889
always fall back to this like are we on

842
00:33:18,910 --> 00:33:22,370
the right trajectory and on the right

843
00:33:20,890 --> 00:33:24,380
path

844
00:33:22,370 --> 00:33:30,370
so now we have somewhat of a framework

845
00:33:24,380 --> 00:33:39,050
to discuss the question is zero-day hard

846
00:33:30,370 --> 00:33:43,760
and I think the truth is it's harder but

847
00:33:39,050 --> 00:33:47,059
not hard and it would be wonderful if I

848
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:48,800
could stand before you and describe the

849
00:33:47,059 --> 00:33:50,840
five years of project zero leading to

850
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:53,330
this great accomplishment where we can

851
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:55,189
in subjective or objective or any sort

852
00:33:53,330 --> 00:33:58,419
of terms describes earth as being hard

853
00:33:55,190 --> 00:34:00,920
and I don't think we're there quite yet

854
00:33:58,420 --> 00:34:03,559
we're looking at a piece of digital art

855
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:06,770
from 1974 I like this because it to me

856
00:34:03,559 --> 00:34:09,739
evokes like an Ida graph you somewhat by

857
00:34:06,770 --> 00:34:11,980
an artist called Vera Mona and she has a

858
00:34:09,739 --> 00:34:15,229
quote in which she says that

859
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:17,240
paradoxically paradoxically machines

860
00:34:15,230 --> 00:34:20,600
which are thought to be cold and inhuman

861
00:34:17,239 --> 00:34:24,589
enable the most subjective and profound

862
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:27,469
in humans and to me this quote really

863
00:34:24,590 --> 00:34:30,740
says that the problem is worth working

864
00:34:27,469 --> 00:34:33,799
on that these machines that Vera was

865
00:34:30,739 --> 00:34:36,649
talking about in 1974 have done so much

866
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:42,320
for our users for society so much

867
00:34:36,649 --> 00:34:45,259
positive and if we can have an impact on

868
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:46,850
these machines being safe to use then

869
00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:48,230
that's a good accomplishment that's

870
00:34:46,850 --> 00:34:50,179
something that we can be proud of and

871
00:34:48,230 --> 00:34:52,550
it's worth worth progressing towards an

872
00:34:50,179 --> 00:34:55,010
aiming for and so it's a little bit of a

873
00:34:52,550 --> 00:34:56,720
pivot to optimism here whilst we haven't

874
00:34:55,010 --> 00:34:59,900
achieved what we have set out to achieve

875
00:34:56,719 --> 00:35:01,850
yet and we're facing substantial

876
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:05,170
challenges towards getting where we need

877
00:35:01,850 --> 00:35:08,600
to get the problem is worth working on

878
00:35:05,170 --> 00:35:11,870
and so I want to step back and abstract

879
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:16,490
a little bit and talk about some lessons

880
00:35:11,870 --> 00:35:18,290
learned from the past five years I'll

881
00:35:16,490 --> 00:35:20,660
start with kind of a core message or a

882
00:35:18,290 --> 00:35:22,190
core narrative and I want to address

883
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:24,529
precisely this challenge that I

884
00:35:22,190 --> 00:35:26,360
mentioned and I won't want to describe

885
00:35:24,530 --> 00:35:28,550
it in sort of a slightly unusual way

886
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:30,890
which is I think there is a risk that

887
00:35:28,550 --> 00:35:33,070
the public state-of-the-art the public

888
00:35:30,890 --> 00:35:36,170
understanding of how attacks really work

889
00:35:33,070 --> 00:35:36,410
diverges from how the private state of

890
00:35:36,170 --> 00:35:38,140
the

891
00:35:36,410 --> 00:35:40,549
looks how attackers are really

892
00:35:38,140 --> 00:35:42,529
implementing these exploits and once

893
00:35:40,549 --> 00:35:45,470
that divergence occurs it's going to be

894
00:35:42,530 --> 00:35:47,450
very difficult to counter

895
00:35:45,470 --> 00:35:50,390
I think this occurs primarily because

896
00:35:47,450 --> 00:35:52,879
the utility of information about an

897
00:35:50,390 --> 00:35:55,730
individual attack the value for an

898
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:57,589
attacker seems to outweigh the value for

899
00:35:55,730 --> 00:35:59,569
a defender for any given individual

900
00:35:57,589 --> 00:36:01,819
vulnerability and so the incentives to

901
00:35:59,569 --> 00:36:05,329
keep this information private to not

902
00:36:01,819 --> 00:36:07,849
share it with with blackhat or or or the

903
00:36:05,329 --> 00:36:10,609
public security community is high and

904
00:36:07,849 --> 00:36:13,760
increasing every year however I think

905
00:36:10,609 --> 00:36:16,700
that the project zero model if you will

906
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:18,559
is a viable approach to staying in line

907
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:20,750
with attacker understanding an attacker

908
00:36:18,559 --> 00:36:23,119
interests I think this is a consequence

909
00:36:20,750 --> 00:36:25,400
of like the self-organizing effects of

910
00:36:23,119 --> 00:36:27,829
giving researchers a high amount of

911
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:29,390
autonomy and freedom and asking them to

912
00:36:27,829 --> 00:36:37,190
align their interest with attacker

913
00:36:29,390 --> 00:36:39,529
interest in a rewarding that the the

914
00:36:37,190 --> 00:36:41,690
story doesn't stop there however it's

915
00:36:39,530 --> 00:36:44,000
not just the project zero style work

916
00:36:41,690 --> 00:36:46,130
allows you to be in line with the tacit

917
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:48,109
interests I really believe that we have

918
00:36:46,130 --> 00:36:50,029
enough insight and evidence about how

919
00:36:48,109 --> 00:36:51,920
this type of work is performed to say

920
00:36:50,029 --> 00:36:53,510
that what we might describe is open

921
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:56,150
attack research in the project zero

922
00:36:53,510 --> 00:36:58,789
model provides the best path forward to

923
00:36:56,150 --> 00:37:02,359
this mission make zero they had there's

924
00:36:58,789 --> 00:37:04,460
a lot to unpack there about why there's

925
00:37:02,359 --> 00:37:07,160
something quite powerful in the

926
00:37:04,460 --> 00:37:10,130
realization that security researchers

927
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:12,558
don't change in the behavior insofar as

928
00:37:10,130 --> 00:37:14,539
users and customers change in the

929
00:37:12,559 --> 00:37:16,819
behavior and there's something really

930
00:37:14,539 --> 00:37:19,460
compelling and powerful about doing this

931
00:37:16,819 --> 00:37:21,288
work in a way that teachers the teachers

932
00:37:19,460 --> 00:37:23,420
users to ask the right questions and

933
00:37:21,289 --> 00:37:27,619
teachers users to ask for the right

934
00:37:23,420 --> 00:37:30,440
things and so I see this as a compelling

935
00:37:27,619 --> 00:37:32,569
path forward but I suspect that you all

936
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:34,910
are not surprised that I would say that

937
00:37:32,569 --> 00:37:36,349
so I'm gonna blast through a couple of

938
00:37:34,910 --> 00:37:40,609
other well actually about eight

939
00:37:36,349 --> 00:37:42,440
different ideas that on my mind at the

940
00:37:40,609 --> 00:37:45,828
moment what we might call the lightning

941
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:49,490
round of random thoughts from from BIM

942
00:37:45,829 --> 00:37:50,090
and the first is a really key idea in

943
00:37:49,490 --> 00:37:52,009
insecure

944
00:37:50,090 --> 00:37:53,840
ready it's this idea that security is

945
00:37:52,010 --> 00:37:56,060
unique because we have an adversary and

946
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:58,370
it's the adversaries job to deprive us

947
00:37:56,060 --> 00:38:00,320
of the data that we need and in fact

948
00:37:58,370 --> 00:38:02,720
it's their job to mislead us actively

949
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:04,400
about what they're working on and so the

950
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:06,529
consequence of this is that if you're

951
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:08,630
making decisions purely based on the

952
00:38:06,530 --> 00:38:11,060
data that's available to you about the

953
00:38:08,630 --> 00:38:14,600
tacit behavior by definition that's

954
00:38:11,060 --> 00:38:15,830
going to be a suboptimal decision and so

955
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:17,799
the consequence of that is that you

956
00:38:15,830 --> 00:38:19,940
really need to model a tacit behavior

957
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:22,490
the problem with that is that there's a

958
00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:24,950
really wide range of justifiable models

959
00:38:22,490 --> 00:38:30,229
for attacking behaviors so many unknowns

960
00:38:24,950 --> 00:38:31,299
here that's a big challenge a sort of

961
00:38:30,230 --> 00:38:35,180
follow-on

962
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:37,490
effect of this is unfortunately I don't

963
00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:40,009
expect that we will ever set or solve

964
00:38:37,490 --> 00:38:41,870
the vulnerability disclosure debate part

965
00:38:40,010 --> 00:38:44,780
of the site thereof in so many validly

966
00:38:41,870 --> 00:38:47,509
justifiable models means that there's

967
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:50,720
also many validly justifiable

968
00:38:47,510 --> 00:38:54,320
vulnerability disclosure policies and I

969
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:56,089
find that often in disclosure debates we

970
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:57,440
tend to lose sight of this that

971
00:38:56,090 --> 00:39:00,350
everybody is working in good faith

972
00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:02,180
towards the same result but just working

973
00:39:00,350 --> 00:39:04,730
off of a different model and so shifting

974
00:39:02,180 --> 00:39:07,160
that discussion as opposed to like flame

975
00:39:04,730 --> 00:39:08,540
wars and an emotional kind of talk of

976
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:10,609
irresponsibility and so forth and

977
00:39:08,540 --> 00:39:12,200
shifting it towards like a discussion of

978
00:39:10,610 --> 00:39:13,850
the data and the discussion of the

979
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:16,879
models I think it's going to be very

980
00:39:13,850 --> 00:39:18,770
beneficial in the long run another sort

981
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:20,690
of consequences of this idea that we

982
00:39:18,770 --> 00:39:23,930
have to model everything about attack of

983
00:39:20,690 --> 00:39:29,390
behavior is that there is a kind of a

984
00:39:23,930 --> 00:39:31,750
hazard I see in which organizations tend

985
00:39:29,390 --> 00:39:33,950
to choose the model the first

986
00:39:31,750 --> 00:39:35,630
justifiable model that they come across

987
00:39:33,950 --> 00:39:39,049
that is in line with their business

988
00:39:35,630 --> 00:39:42,710
goals or business aims or organizational

989
00:39:39,050 --> 00:39:45,320
aims whatever that might be and it's

990
00:39:42,710 --> 00:39:47,540
very challenging once this occurs once

991
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:49,550
this comfortable model sets in and you

992
00:39:47,540 --> 00:39:53,600
have sort of a way of seeing the world

993
00:39:49,550 --> 00:39:55,700
which is justifiable but is tightly

994
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:57,560
coupled to your broader aims as an

995
00:39:55,700 --> 00:40:01,430
organization I find it very challenging

996
00:39:57,560 --> 00:40:03,020
to to motivate people to iterate on

997
00:40:01,430 --> 00:40:04,879
their models to move

998
00:40:03,020 --> 00:40:08,259
incrementally towards something that is

999
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:11,240
better for user security and better for

1000
00:40:08,260 --> 00:40:12,980
the accuracy of the decisions you make

1001
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:16,629
with the model so this I think is a

1002
00:40:12,980 --> 00:40:16,630
really big unsolved problem

1003
00:40:17,589 --> 00:40:21,589
vulnerability triage speaking of

1004
00:40:19,339 --> 00:40:23,710
audibility disclosure we report a huge

1005
00:40:21,589 --> 00:40:26,119
number of probabilities and the work of

1006
00:40:23,710 --> 00:40:27,950
triaging and responding and fixedness

1007
00:40:26,119 --> 00:40:30,830
vulnerabilities is incredibly

1008
00:40:27,950 --> 00:40:34,310
undervalued when done well this can be

1009
00:40:30,830 --> 00:40:36,020
hugely impactful work taking the high

1010
00:40:34,310 --> 00:40:38,000
quality reports from external

1011
00:40:36,020 --> 00:40:39,950
researchers and really extracting as

1012
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:42,410
much value from that report as possible

1013
00:40:39,950 --> 00:40:44,419
however if done poorly it can be a

1014
00:40:42,410 --> 00:40:47,210
systemic risk when we're thinking of for

1015
00:40:44,420 --> 00:40:49,670
example a patch attempt that doesn't fix

1016
00:40:47,210 --> 00:40:51,530
the vulnerability correctly where the

1017
00:40:49,670 --> 00:40:56,690
patch essentially signals Ravana bility

1018
00:40:51,530 --> 00:41:01,240
is and leads to variants that later on

1019
00:40:56,690 --> 00:41:04,130
discovered by attackers and I think I

1020
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:06,589
see this as a somewhat urgent problem

1021
00:41:04,130 --> 00:41:08,570
where we need to value this work more we

1022
00:41:06,589 --> 00:41:10,250
need to recognize it frankly we need to

1023
00:41:08,570 --> 00:41:12,710
promote these people we need to pay them

1024
00:41:10,250 --> 00:41:13,820
more we need to empower them to make the

1025
00:41:12,710 --> 00:41:16,280
changes that you need to make

1026
00:41:13,820 --> 00:41:19,160
organizationally we need to enable them

1027
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:20,780
to connect with external researchers and

1028
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:22,339
remove layers of bureaucracy from their

1029
00:41:20,780 --> 00:41:25,700
role there's a whole range of things

1030
00:41:22,339 --> 00:41:29,630
that we need to change in this type of

1031
00:41:25,700 --> 00:41:32,330
work and I think we need to shift this

1032
00:41:29,630 --> 00:41:34,940
this type of role from being a stepping

1033
00:41:32,330 --> 00:41:36,950
stone towards other projects and just

1034
00:41:34,940 --> 00:41:39,320
something that we want to get through

1035
00:41:36,950 --> 00:41:42,529
and then we want to move on to a more

1036
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:44,150
interesting work and really make a pipe

1037
00:41:42,530 --> 00:41:46,369
line of work around these external

1038
00:41:44,150 --> 00:41:49,010
reports that extracts as much as we

1039
00:41:46,369 --> 00:41:51,500
possibly can and leads to collaboration

1040
00:41:49,010 --> 00:41:52,970
and all of those good stuff this is I

1041
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:55,670
see this kind of across the board

1042
00:41:52,970 --> 00:41:59,029
there isn't any one vendor that's fallen

1043
00:41:55,670 --> 00:42:04,490
into this trap in particular it's a very

1044
00:41:59,030 --> 00:42:06,920
common pattern and so speaking of this

1045
00:42:04,490 --> 00:42:08,868
idea that often there's a temptation

1046
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:10,550
just to get through the vulnerability

1047
00:42:08,869 --> 00:42:12,560
triage queue and then move on to work

1048
00:42:10,550 --> 00:42:14,690
that really matters I think there's a

1049
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:15,960
tendency to think that we can engineer

1050
00:42:14,690 --> 00:42:21,750
our way out of the problem

1051
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:24,240
with mitigations with sandboxes and with

1052
00:42:21,750 --> 00:42:26,700
attack surface reduction alone and I

1053
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:29,189
think this perhaps is now unpopular to

1054
00:42:26,700 --> 00:42:30,810
say but vulnerabilities do matter

1055
00:42:29,190 --> 00:42:32,940
fixing individual vulnerabilities matter

1056
00:42:30,810 --> 00:42:34,620
in a world where we're just shipping

1057
00:42:32,940 --> 00:42:36,960
exploit mitigations but not

1058
00:42:34,620 --> 00:42:38,609
substantially improving the software

1059
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:40,170
security and the underlying security

1060
00:42:38,610 --> 00:42:41,850
practices and development practices

1061
00:42:40,170 --> 00:42:44,490
we're always going to be able to find

1062
00:42:41,850 --> 00:42:45,750
edge case vulnerabilities the edge case

1063
00:42:44,490 --> 00:42:47,430
vulnerabilities that still have

1064
00:42:45,750 --> 00:42:50,100
desirable properties that allow us to

1065
00:42:47,430 --> 00:42:52,049
bypass all of your best defenses and so

1066
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:53,520
it's the combination of bug fixing and

1067
00:42:52,050 --> 00:42:56,570
building all of a structural

1068
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:59,280
improvements that is most effective a

1069
00:42:56,570 --> 00:43:01,170
quick aside on bug collision we've

1070
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:03,120
reported a lot of vulnerabilities over

1071
00:43:01,170 --> 00:43:04,920
1500 and I think doing this work

1072
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:07,290
publicly gives us a unique perspective

1073
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:09,270
on bug collision a global perspective if

1074
00:43:07,290 --> 00:43:11,580
you will doing this work in a very

1075
00:43:09,270 --> 00:43:14,220
high-profile manner and locked private

1076
00:43:11,580 --> 00:43:16,710
conversations about by collision with

1077
00:43:14,220 --> 00:43:18,450
real-world attackers and this is a

1078
00:43:16,710 --> 00:43:19,590
perspective that I think I would just

1079
00:43:18,450 --> 00:43:21,990
want to point out that attackers

1080
00:43:19,590 --> 00:43:23,730
themselves don't share attackers tend to

1081
00:43:21,990 --> 00:43:26,220
think about bike collision in terms of

1082
00:43:23,730 --> 00:43:28,890
their vulnerability findings colliding

1083
00:43:26,220 --> 00:43:30,779
with I've been there fixing a particular

1084
00:43:28,890 --> 00:43:32,819
set of vulnerabilities the rate of their

1085
00:43:30,780 --> 00:43:34,290
bugs being fixed but really what you

1086
00:43:32,820 --> 00:43:36,570
want to measure when thinking about bug

1087
00:43:34,290 --> 00:43:38,970
collision is the rate of any individual

1088
00:43:36,570 --> 00:43:42,200
attacker colliding with any other

1089
00:43:38,970 --> 00:43:44,819
attacker globally and so shifting

1090
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:46,710
perspectives or realizing that we each

1091
00:43:44,820 --> 00:43:48,870
have sort of blind spots and our

1092
00:43:46,710 --> 00:43:50,130
understanding of our collision is going

1093
00:43:48,870 --> 00:43:53,490
to be very important for a lot of policy

1094
00:43:50,130 --> 00:43:55,320
discussions coming up opportunism is

1095
00:43:53,490 --> 00:43:56,819
magic I won't dwell on this too much but

1096
00:43:55,320 --> 00:44:00,150
this idea of having a high degree of

1097
00:43:56,820 --> 00:44:02,610
flexibility has paid off time and time

1098
00:44:00,150 --> 00:44:04,080
again for projects era the idea that we

1099
00:44:02,610 --> 00:44:06,360
don't always know what we're going to

1100
00:44:04,080 --> 00:44:09,450
achieve and we set out and that we kind

1101
00:44:06,360 --> 00:44:11,610
of form a strategic plan as we're

1102
00:44:09,450 --> 00:44:16,560
proceeding through a particular research

1103
00:44:11,610 --> 00:44:19,080
project that the results are tied in to

1104
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:22,529
a strategic plan and that the results

1105
00:44:19,080 --> 00:44:24,390
are occurring through this magic of a

1106
00:44:22,530 --> 00:44:27,230
high amount of flexibility and autonomy

1107
00:44:24,390 --> 00:44:31,080
and the team

1108
00:44:27,230 --> 00:44:32,310
and finally a quick word on what we

1109
00:44:31,080 --> 00:44:35,340
might call great that's not to sound too

1110
00:44:32,310 --> 00:44:36,570
highfalutin like all pursuits like all

1111
00:44:35,340 --> 00:44:38,580
types of work I think there is a

1112
00:44:36,570 --> 00:44:40,560
difference between good and great and

1113
00:44:38,580 --> 00:44:44,009
security research it's not clear exactly

1114
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:46,080
what that is it's not just being super

1115
00:44:44,010 --> 00:44:48,300
creative because mechanical perfection

1116
00:44:46,080 --> 00:44:51,150
there's a type of greatness too but we

1117
00:44:48,300 --> 00:44:54,750
tend to know what we see it know when we

1118
00:44:51,150 --> 00:44:57,030
see it and the key here I believe is

1119
00:44:54,750 --> 00:45:00,180
that pursuing greatness requires taking

1120
00:44:57,030 --> 00:45:02,780
risks and people are only going to take

1121
00:45:00,180 --> 00:45:05,940
risks if they feel safe to do so and so

1122
00:45:02,780 --> 00:45:09,240
this concept of rebounding from failure

1123
00:45:05,940 --> 00:45:11,430
from having sort of positive culture

1124
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:14,220
around negative results is really really

1125
00:45:11,430 --> 00:45:17,339
important to give space to pursue

1126
00:45:14,220 --> 00:45:19,799
greatness and that really is a random

1127
00:45:17,340 --> 00:45:22,230
grab bag of ideas that I've have in my

1128
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:24,240
mind in the past month or so there's a

1129
00:45:22,230 --> 00:45:26,430
lot to unpack there a lot of intensity

1130
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:29,160
in the last five minutes I want to just

1131
00:45:26,430 --> 00:45:32,220
work through the next five years of

1132
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:35,250
project zero and it probably makes sense

1133
00:45:32,220 --> 00:45:37,890
to start with what won't change and this

1134
00:45:35,250 --> 00:45:40,680
is the the coral the pipeline of work

1135
00:45:37,890 --> 00:45:42,270
the canonical pipeline of work I suspect

1136
00:45:40,680 --> 00:45:43,859
that this will look fairly familiar in

1137
00:45:42,270 --> 00:45:46,560
the next five years have you're

1138
00:45:43,860 --> 00:45:48,870
certainly a few areas like mobile and

1139
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:50,130
browser security where I would expect we

1140
00:45:48,870 --> 00:45:52,380
continue to make significant

1141
00:45:50,130 --> 00:45:56,330
contributions and will be a focus but

1142
00:45:52,380 --> 00:46:00,090
also I suspect that we were shift a

1143
00:45:56,330 --> 00:46:01,890
scope over time in line with the

1144
00:46:00,090 --> 00:46:03,360
attackers interest shifting as well and

1145
00:46:01,890 --> 00:46:04,740
that's somewhat hard to predict we're

1146
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:07,350
what's that going to look like is it's

1147
00:46:04,740 --> 00:46:09,450
this idea of like a hybrid inside the

1148
00:46:07,350 --> 00:46:12,150
risk using zero-day is a more server

1149
00:46:09,450 --> 00:46:15,750
side as clouds are hard where it's hard

1150
00:46:12,150 --> 00:46:18,030
to say but keep an eye out we're going

1151
00:46:15,750 --> 00:46:23,700
to continue doing vulnerability research

1152
00:46:18,030 --> 00:46:25,560
and exploit development work I think

1153
00:46:23,700 --> 00:46:26,759
actually just briefly before I move on

1154
00:46:25,560 --> 00:46:28,380
there are a couple of areas where I

1155
00:46:26,760 --> 00:46:30,030
think we can sort of redouble wire

1156
00:46:28,380 --> 00:46:32,190
investments somewhat methodology

1157
00:46:30,030 --> 00:46:33,930
building is a key area I think we

1158
00:46:32,190 --> 00:46:35,670
weren't that practitioner driven

1159
00:46:33,930 --> 00:46:37,350
methodology development created new

1160
00:46:35,670 --> 00:46:40,110
approaches to find vulnerabilities is

1161
00:46:37,350 --> 00:46:40,799
very very effective and also in terms of

1162
00:46:40,110 --> 00:46:42,300
the structural and

1163
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:44,850
provements learning how to be good

1164
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:47,310
advocates for this change nobody's done

1165
00:46:44,850 --> 00:46:49,140
this working exactly this type of model

1166
00:46:47,310 --> 00:46:51,210
before and so we're kind of learning as

1167
00:46:49,140 --> 00:46:52,859
we go along I think what we know now is

1168
00:46:51,210 --> 00:46:54,810
that we have to ratchet up the level of

1169
00:46:52,860 --> 00:46:57,330
experimentation as a results to

1170
00:46:54,810 --> 00:46:59,460
advocating for structural improvements

1171
00:46:57,330 --> 00:47:01,020
and we have to improve our operational

1172
00:46:59,460 --> 00:47:03,090
rigor we've been very good at like

1173
00:47:01,020 --> 00:47:04,680
throwing great ideas across a fence but

1174
00:47:03,090 --> 00:47:06,090
not so good that the follow up and and

1175
00:47:04,680 --> 00:47:10,890
really making that happen with

1176
00:47:06,090 --> 00:47:13,320
discipline and certainly there's lots of

1177
00:47:10,890 --> 00:47:15,120
other great things that that we have in

1178
00:47:13,320 --> 00:47:16,500
the works are really excited about when

1179
00:47:15,120 --> 00:47:18,529
you may be stoned on to the team two

1180
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:20,520
leaders or their analysis effort

1181
00:47:18,530 --> 00:47:24,690
certainly we're talking to a lot of

1182
00:47:20,520 --> 00:47:26,430
vendors about partnership we've been in

1183
00:47:24,690 --> 00:47:28,470
constant communication with vendors over

1184
00:47:26,430 --> 00:47:30,180
the past five years and they're often

1185
00:47:28,470 --> 00:47:32,100
encouraging us to work very closely with

1186
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:33,750
them and really finding like what the

1187
00:47:32,100 --> 00:47:35,670
trade-offs are and which approaches are

1188
00:47:33,750 --> 00:47:37,950
more effective very tight partnership

1189
00:47:35,670 --> 00:47:40,470
versus this purely independent research

1190
00:47:37,950 --> 00:47:42,629
model and utilizing the power of open

1191
00:47:40,470 --> 00:47:45,500
the tech research I think we really want

1192
00:47:42,630 --> 00:47:47,610
to explore both sides of that equation

1193
00:47:45,500 --> 00:47:50,190
stepping into policy discussions

1194
00:47:47,610 --> 00:47:54,090
certainly I see a lot of important

1195
00:47:50,190 --> 00:47:56,610
discussions and debate at the moment

1196
00:47:54,090 --> 00:47:59,820
related to security research and I think

1197
00:47:56,610 --> 00:48:02,790
that as practitioners we can have a role

1198
00:47:59,820 --> 00:48:04,860
in terms of lifting the level of

1199
00:48:02,790 --> 00:48:08,370
technical understanding in some of these

1200
00:48:04,860 --> 00:48:10,260
discussions sharing our results new

1201
00:48:08,370 --> 00:48:11,370
audiences certainly we've done very good

1202
00:48:10,260 --> 00:48:12,840
at speaking to other security

1203
00:48:11,370 --> 00:48:14,220
researchers there's lots more that we

1204
00:48:12,840 --> 00:48:16,860
could do to speak to developers

1205
00:48:14,220 --> 00:48:20,129
Enterprise users etc we have a lot of

1206
00:48:16,860 --> 00:48:23,880
insights that go above and beyond really

1207
00:48:20,130 --> 00:48:25,410
low level expert development details the

1208
00:48:23,880 --> 00:48:27,120
patch gap certainly this is a problem

1209
00:48:25,410 --> 00:48:28,620
around one day it's on our mind that

1210
00:48:27,120 --> 00:48:32,460
were into alignment too much for the

1211
00:48:28,620 --> 00:48:34,740
purposes of time and internally to the

1212
00:48:32,460 --> 00:48:36,570
team thinking about collaboration we are

1213
00:48:34,740 --> 00:48:38,520
sort of like this independent alliance

1214
00:48:36,570 --> 00:48:41,190
of researchers working towards the same

1215
00:48:38,520 --> 00:48:42,570
mission and collaboration tends to

1216
00:48:41,190 --> 00:48:44,460
happen very organically there's a

1217
00:48:42,570 --> 00:48:48,090
natural process of research agendas

1218
00:48:44,460 --> 00:48:50,820
overlapping and that works fairly well

1219
00:48:48,090 --> 00:48:52,290
over time but I think I've heard great

1220
00:48:50,820 --> 00:48:54,650
things about what

1221
00:48:52,290 --> 00:48:57,779
structured collaboration can perform

1222
00:48:54,650 --> 00:49:01,080
when done a MOBOT ability research city

1223
00:48:57,780 --> 00:49:02,730
for example sitting down on literally

1224
00:49:01,080 --> 00:49:04,740
the same monitor performing a manual

1225
00:49:02,730 --> 00:49:08,670
review together ideas like this I think

1226
00:49:04,740 --> 00:49:12,600
I'm really excited to try out so to

1227
00:49:08,670 --> 00:49:15,470
recap diving back to our core message to

1228
00:49:12,600 --> 00:49:18,600
this idea of the best path forward and

1229
00:49:15,470 --> 00:49:21,480
so within this message there's the sense

1230
00:49:18,600 --> 00:49:23,190
that we want to encourage more open

1231
00:49:21,480 --> 00:49:25,290
attack research more researchers

1232
00:49:23,190 --> 00:49:26,970
publishing full technical details about

1233
00:49:25,290 --> 00:49:29,100
vulnerability research and exploit

1234
00:49:26,970 --> 00:49:31,020
development and then following that up

1235
00:49:29,100 --> 00:49:33,120
and using that that publish work to

1236
00:49:31,020 --> 00:49:34,890
motivate structural changes and long

1237
00:49:33,120 --> 00:49:37,470
term improvements to security we want we

1238
00:49:34,890 --> 00:49:38,790
want more of it and so one way we can

1239
00:49:37,470 --> 00:49:40,740
achieve that is obviously by growing

1240
00:49:38,790 --> 00:49:43,680
project zero and we're certainly

1241
00:49:40,740 --> 00:49:46,439
planning to do that but another sort of

1242
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:48,509
logical conclusion is that we can expand

1243
00:49:46,440 --> 00:49:51,480
the amount of open attack research by

1244
00:49:48,510 --> 00:49:53,310
having more project zeros and this is an

1245
00:49:51,480 --> 00:49:55,770
idea a concept that we certainly have

1246
00:49:53,310 --> 00:49:56,940
talked about as a team for many many

1247
00:49:55,770 --> 00:49:59,160
years it was always sort of like an

1248
00:49:56,940 --> 00:50:02,310
implicit hope that we had that we could

1249
00:49:59,160 --> 00:50:04,350
motivate the creation of more teams like

1250
00:50:02,310 --> 00:50:08,790
project zero but we never had an

1251
00:50:04,350 --> 00:50:10,170
explicit goal in my sense there's a lot

1252
00:50:08,790 --> 00:50:12,900
of work in industry happening already

1253
00:50:10,170 --> 00:50:16,590
that is very close to project zero style

1254
00:50:12,900 --> 00:50:18,030
work and I really would encourage people

1255
00:50:16,590 --> 00:50:20,640
to forget about vulnerability disclosure

1256
00:50:18,030 --> 00:50:23,370
for a moment and instead try to focus in

1257
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:25,080
on the mission and the principles and so

1258
00:50:23,370 --> 00:50:28,080
that with the net finding areas of

1259
00:50:25,080 --> 00:50:30,750
commonality finding areas where we are

1260
00:50:28,080 --> 00:50:32,880
seeing eye to eye and and things are in

1261
00:50:30,750 --> 00:50:34,680
line for ability disclosure if nothing

1262
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:36,960
in this conversation is a bit of a

1263
00:50:34,680 --> 00:50:39,060
distraction we can agree to disagree on

1264
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:41,820
a lot of the debility disclosure details

1265
00:50:39,060 --> 00:50:45,480
but focusing on that common mission and

1266
00:50:41,820 --> 00:50:47,970
common principles when I talk to two

1267
00:50:45,480 --> 00:50:50,190
people throughout the security industry

1268
00:50:47,970 --> 00:50:52,439
with a veteran industry or other areas

1269
00:50:50,190 --> 00:50:55,110
other organizations I do see a lot of

1270
00:50:52,440 --> 00:50:58,270
reason for optimism there are a lot of

1271
00:50:55,110 --> 00:51:02,350
shit principles and there are a lot of

1272
00:50:58,270 --> 00:51:03,940
shed approaches to this mission and so I

1273
00:51:02,350 --> 00:51:07,868
think I can set out at least new

1274
00:51:03,940 --> 00:51:10,060
personal goal there would be wonderful

1275
00:51:07,869 --> 00:51:12,100
outcome in five years time to be on the

1276
00:51:10,060 --> 00:51:15,070
stage talking about a coalition of

1277
00:51:12,100 --> 00:51:17,950
project zeros and then the interest of

1278
00:51:15,070 --> 00:51:20,230
making it not to was she watching here's

1279
00:51:17,950 --> 00:51:21,819
one possible sketch for how that might

1280
00:51:20,230 --> 00:51:23,680
work in practice it's incredibly

1281
00:51:21,820 --> 00:51:25,990
lightweight it doesn't need to be

1282
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:27,819
difficult a website somewhere to

1283
00:51:25,990 --> 00:51:30,040
organize and aggregate the security

1284
00:51:27,820 --> 00:51:31,869
research results where instead of having

1285
00:51:30,040 --> 00:51:34,180
Twitter as like the primary broadcast

1286
00:51:31,869 --> 00:51:36,070
medium that we have somewhere where we

1287
00:51:34,180 --> 00:51:38,109
can categorize all of the amazing attack

1288
00:51:36,070 --> 00:51:40,240
research work that's happening in kind

1289
00:51:38,110 --> 00:51:43,000
of a sensible and organized fashion a

1290
00:51:40,240 --> 00:51:47,439
mailing list to sort of unlock this the

1291
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:49,060
spirit of IRC to sort of not as a

1292
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:51,280
vulnerability sharing Club but as a

1293
00:51:49,060 --> 00:51:53,290
place to have lightweight collaboration

1294
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:55,240
and a place to have technical

1295
00:51:53,290 --> 00:51:58,060
discussions together and of course some

1296
00:51:55,240 --> 00:51:59,890
sort of meeting a simple summit to

1297
00:51:58,060 --> 00:52:02,560
discuss attacker trends and attack a

1298
00:51:59,890 --> 00:52:04,600
behavior it really shouldn't be too

1299
00:52:02,560 --> 00:52:06,940
difficult I think it really comes down

1300
00:52:04,600 --> 00:52:08,980
to thinking about the core principles

1301
00:52:06,940 --> 00:52:11,350
the core mission that we have in common

1302
00:52:08,980 --> 00:52:13,510
so if you are on an attack research team

1303
00:52:11,350 --> 00:52:17,109
of this nature or would like to be or a

1304
00:52:13,510 --> 00:52:19,000
planning to create one in the future one

1305
00:52:17,109 --> 00:52:20,890
call to action I have at the very end of

1306
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:23,440
this presentation is please come find us

1307
00:52:20,890 --> 00:52:26,890
and this talk about a coalition of open

1308
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:29,650
attack research it's been an absolute

1309
00:52:26,890 --> 00:52:31,089
pleasure I want to say thank you to all

1310
00:52:29,650 --> 00:52:33,280
of the people I work with the project

1311
00:52:31,090 --> 00:52:36,100
Sarah it's been a fabulous five years

1312
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:37,150
the best five years of my career and I'm

1313
00:52:36,100 --> 00:52:39,430
really really excited and looking

1314
00:52:37,150 --> 00:52:41,200
forward to the next five years and also

1315
00:52:39,430 --> 00:52:43,149
thank you all and the audience for

1316
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:50,029
listening to my presentation

1317
00:52:43,150 --> 00:52:50,030
[Applause]
