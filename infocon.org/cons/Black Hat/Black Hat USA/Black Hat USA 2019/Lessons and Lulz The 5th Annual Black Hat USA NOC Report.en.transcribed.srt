look at weird traffic and just generally

66
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:33,970
have a good time at blackhat they are

67
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:35,620
security professionals from analyst

68
00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:38,050
level all the way up to VPS and their

69
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:41,560
organizations and and they're here just

70
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:43,930
to chill basically we also have not

71
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:45,610
partners which we'll get into in a

72
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:47,170
moment but each of those partners

73
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:50,560
normally sends between two to four

74
00:03:47,170 --> 00:03:52,600
people those two or four people will

75
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:56,020
often rotate in shifts so that there's

76
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:59,680
always representation there so speaking

77
00:03:56,020 --> 00:04:02,320
of partners yes you guys seen a lot of

78
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:04,120
these names before we've we've had a

79
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:06,280
nice tight crews we've been running with

80
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:09,580
the partners here for a while

81
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:10,930
Palo Alto RSA Cisco Centrelink ruckus

82
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:13,150
and gig come on we'll get into

83
00:04:10,930 --> 00:04:14,740
architecture here in a minute but we

84
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:15,819
always kind of want to reiterate that

85
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:18,009
these are

86
00:04:15,819 --> 00:04:19,358
partners they're not sponsors they

87
00:04:18,009 --> 00:04:22,930
haven't paid to be in the NOC with us

88
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:25,750
it's not anything that whoever pays the

89
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:28,050
most money gets to be the NOC we've made

90
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:31,030
a very conscious effort and chose these

91
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:33,550
these partners the equipment that they

92
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:36,580
bring and the talented they bring as

93
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:38,350
well so there they're also a part of the

94
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:39,849
family at this point yeah so just a

95
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:42,580
little history for those who don't know

96
00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:45,190
when initially when I started doing the

97
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:47,948
network at blackhat we did it with Cisco

98
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:50,979
2600 router a couple of Netgear switches

99
00:04:47,949 --> 00:04:53,320
and those Cisco ApS that you would put

100
00:04:50,979 --> 00:04:55,419
the Orinoco gold cards in and like tape

101
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:57,780
and antenna to a wall right we used to

102
00:04:55,419 --> 00:05:00,789
do it like that then you know we started

103
00:04:57,780 --> 00:05:04,119
having you know additional needs and

104
00:05:00,789 --> 00:05:07,509
scale we the first show I did a us show

105
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:10,810
was 1500 people world will be over

106
00:05:07,509 --> 00:05:13,180
20,000 for blackhat for this show so

107
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:15,849
some growth so we had a scale issue

108
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:18,460
right because we started doing things as

109
00:05:15,849 --> 00:05:21,370
it grew with all roll-your-own open

110
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:23,770
source we had so Chris boxes running

111
00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:25,870
openbsd and we did everything with PF

112
00:05:23,770 --> 00:05:29,469
for our own customer and scripts to have

113
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:32,050
it call home and we'd have configuration

114
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:35,050
parties and somebody on the NOC teams

115
00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:37,930
living room for weeks leading up to the

116
00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:41,169
show and at one point bar and I sat next

117
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:44,110
to each other at a u.s. show and said

118
00:05:41,169 --> 00:05:46,659
man this is insane like I wonder if we

119
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:50,020
can get like one of these vendors to

120
00:05:46,659 --> 00:05:51,430
give us gear and so we're like oh let's

121
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:53,680
go down the expo hall and ass and we'll

122
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:57,010
say like hey if you give us some gear

123
00:05:53,680 --> 00:06:01,060
we'll say this is what the blackhat not

124
00:05:57,010 --> 00:06:02,680
chooses for the NAM right that sounds

125
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:04,150
like a good trade a million dollars

126
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:06,970
worth of equipment for some like hey

127
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:09,690
look what we use this know a lot of

128
00:06:06,970 --> 00:06:12,130
self-importance in that like thing right

129
00:06:09,690 --> 00:06:15,180
but we took our egos and we went

130
00:06:12,130 --> 00:06:18,009
downstairs and into the expo floor and

131
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:19,539
walked up to one of the vendors that we

132
00:06:18,009 --> 00:06:21,310
were interested in partnering with and

133
00:06:19,539 --> 00:06:23,050
we said hey hi we're the guys who run

134
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:24,870
the NOC we were curious if you would be

135
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:26,840
interested and they were like yes

136
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:30,530
whatever it is

137
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:34,630
yes and I looked at barn he looked at me

138
00:06:30,530 --> 00:06:37,729
and we were like oh let's go shopping

139
00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:39,979
and so that's what we did we walked

140
00:06:37,729 --> 00:06:42,770
around the expo floor going I'll have

141
00:06:39,979 --> 00:06:44,270
some of that and on some of that what

142
00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:46,280
you got over there sprinkle a little bit

143
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:47,030
on top of that I'll take it I'll take it

144
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:50,570
I'll take it

145
00:06:47,030 --> 00:06:51,979
um and everybody was super gracious they

146
00:06:50,570 --> 00:06:54,830
were just like yes absolutely what do

147
00:06:51,979 --> 00:06:56,449
you need you know here's more more MORE

148
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:58,729
and we've whittled things down and

149
00:06:56,449 --> 00:07:00,169
figured out exactly what works for the

150
00:06:58,729 --> 00:07:02,180
NACA we've had to change certain

151
00:07:00,169 --> 00:07:04,820
partners or different things again as we

152
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:07,010
scale door needs change but we think we

153
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:08,419
have a pretty good mix right now we've

154
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:11,659
been working with these partners for a

155
00:07:08,419 --> 00:07:12,919
few years and and it's going well so

156
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:17,540
don't screw it up guys

157
00:07:12,919 --> 00:07:19,039
just a kid no serious a little bit did

158
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:23,210
you see the expo floor

159
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:24,979
I will pick whoever I want no so

160
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:26,900
so yeah so it's a good mix and everybody

161
00:07:24,979 --> 00:07:33,020
works really well together so it's been

162
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:34,820
good I think what yeah I won't get into

163
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:40,520
it I was gonna tell Corey and that's not

164
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:44,150
that's not a good not fair yeah okay so

165
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:47,030
the architecture has always kind of kept

166
00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:48,979
a simple theme with us and that is keep

167
00:07:47,030 --> 00:07:50,570
it simple so the whole kiss thing keep

168
00:07:48,979 --> 00:07:53,719
it simple stupid is is really what we've

169
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:55,780
tried to live the policy here when we

170
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:59,030
build the networks for these shows so

171
00:07:55,780 --> 00:08:00,799
one of the big things that we've been

172
00:07:59,030 --> 00:08:02,270
pushing that those of you in trainings

173
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:04,220
may have noticed more than others that

174
00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:05,900
just come to briefings as that we're

175
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:07,940
trying to not wire things and there's a

176
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:09,200
big piece of this that that hasn't

177
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:10,310
really come to this but we'll dig

178
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:12,860
through this a little bit really quick

179
00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:17,539
so Palo Alto brought us a pair of 50 to

180
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:20,479
60 s running the core in the land of the

181
00:08:17,539 --> 00:08:22,880
10 gig circuits the 210 gig circuits we

182
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:26,409
have from CenturyLink so 20 gigs of

183
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:29,599
bandwidth you guys enjoyed it

184
00:08:26,410 --> 00:08:31,160
panorama was with palo alto gigamon

185
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:34,039
brings their gig of you that they used

186
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:36,320
to we use that to tap the traffic and

187
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:39,659
provide it to our tools including RSA

188
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:42,180
that witness RSA also brings

189
00:08:39,659 --> 00:08:45,329
and identity force throughout the

190
00:08:42,179 --> 00:08:48,388
infrastructure ruckus provides their icx

191
00:08:45,329 --> 00:08:50,099
switching throughout the course witching

192
00:08:48,389 --> 00:08:52,769
as well as all the distribution switches

193
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:54,509
we replace all of the Mandalay Bay

194
00:08:52,769 --> 00:08:57,389
switching and basically just use the

195
00:08:54,509 --> 00:08:58,769
cables in the wall and then the are six

196
00:08:57,389 --> 00:09:00,959
hundreds and I believe we had some are

197
00:08:58,769 --> 00:09:05,310
seven tens I don't seem oh just to give

198
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:06,569
me the nod but access point so one quick

199
00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:08,638
little thing that I like to talk about

200
00:09:06,569 --> 00:09:10,920
is we get into this again about the

201
00:09:08,639 --> 00:09:13,079
wired steps we had ten thousand inch

202
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:17,099
students for training this year and we

203
00:09:13,079 --> 00:09:20,430
had one room that had wired connections

204
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:23,819
for students and as far as we were aware

205
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:26,758
it went very very smooth so hopefully

206
00:09:23,819 --> 00:09:28,769
you guys will continue to see growth

207
00:09:26,759 --> 00:09:31,589
there and basically just why that that's

208
00:09:28,769 --> 00:09:34,139
an important thing to say to we don't

209
00:09:31,589 --> 00:09:37,829
use any of man delays infrastructure

210
00:09:34,139 --> 00:09:39,720
right we come in early we replace all

211
00:09:37,829 --> 00:09:41,989
the switches all the routers all the

212
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:45,209
firewalls everything every access point

213
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:47,880
is ours or our partners all right it

214
00:09:45,209 --> 00:09:50,130
belongs to the knot we do that because

215
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:52,470
it allows us the ability or we're

216
00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:54,209
control freaks a little bit but it

217
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:56,339
allows us the ability to have that level

218
00:09:54,209 --> 00:09:58,739
of control and also should we see

219
00:09:56,339 --> 00:10:01,470
something that is genuinely bad we have

220
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:07,380
the option to do mitigation versus just

221
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:09,449
going well that's sad so so we replace

222
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:11,459
everything and the only thing that we

223
00:10:09,449 --> 00:10:14,849
use for Mandalay is the wires in the

224
00:10:11,459 --> 00:10:18,329
wall and so of the 88 different classes

225
00:10:14,850 --> 00:10:20,819
that that happened this year there we

226
00:10:18,329 --> 00:10:22,888
had we had one issue where the class

227
00:10:20,819 --> 00:10:24,449
they didn't actually go hard down but

228
00:10:22,889 --> 00:10:26,279
something weird was happening toward the

229
00:10:24,449 --> 00:10:28,439
end of one of the training days and when

230
00:10:26,279 --> 00:10:30,480
we chased it down it literally was the

231
00:10:28,439 --> 00:10:34,589
freaking wire in the wall

232
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:37,740
again I'm like what do you do gonna do

233
00:10:34,589 --> 00:10:39,629
yeah Mike so the last point of failure

234
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:41,670
the only one we can't control and it

235
00:10:39,629 --> 00:10:45,779
freakin failed but only for one class so

236
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:49,800
we'll take those numbers for sure so

237
00:10:45,779 --> 00:10:51,100
there's that so Bart just just said this

238
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:53,199
off to you and I had

239
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:55,710
next slide but I wanted to see how much

240
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:58,090
he could remember he did fairly well

241
00:10:55,710 --> 00:11:00,280
like if you're watching this on YouTube

242
00:10:58,090 --> 00:11:04,540
later you can pull it back to see how he

243
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:06,640
did so so yeah so this is all the gear

244
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:09,040
so we bring a lot of stuff it is it is

245
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:13,000
pallets worth of gear that all get

246
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:15,089
rolled in and an unpacked it's a it's

247
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:18,310
quite the undertaking but in the end

248
00:11:15,090 --> 00:11:20,470
this is what we found works for us he

249
00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:24,819
mentioned the 210 gig circuits from

250
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:27,580
CenturyLink we used to have one to one

251
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:30,610
gig circuits still Denver and Sunnyvale

252
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:32,680
but we started you know maxing those out

253
00:11:30,610 --> 00:11:35,440
we jumped to the 10 gig circuits last

254
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:37,870
year and you guys used probably like

255
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:40,360
less than 30% of that available

256
00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:43,030
bandwidth and I think bike did like 13

257
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:46,000
gigs yeah there was a there was a couple

258
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:48,670
of larger spikes but overall I think it

259
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:51,010
was pretty Polly still only used about

260
00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:54,939
40% I think this year as far as what

261
00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:57,610
what we could do someone in one of the

262
00:11:54,940 --> 00:12:02,170
classes discovered that that there was a

263
00:11:57,610 --> 00:12:04,480
lot of options whatever they just uh

264
00:12:02,170 --> 00:12:07,900
they fired up mass scan and we're like

265
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:09,700
the entire Internet and we saw it

266
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:13,510
because of one of the dashboards that we

267
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:15,700
have it was just like wow and so because

268
00:12:13,510 --> 00:12:18,370
of the way that we layout the classrooms

269
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:20,530
and the subnets we know what room that

270
00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:24,220
the individuals are in because you know

271
00:12:20,530 --> 00:12:25,930
so we trotted down there and we're like

272
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:28,300
okay we don't know exactly where you're

273
00:12:25,930 --> 00:12:29,620
sitting right we just shut off the

274
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:32,020
lights and the guy who's Nick was

275
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:35,290
glowing that was the guy

276
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:38,829
so you know we were like we're like hey

277
00:12:35,290 --> 00:12:40,449
man that's cool you know I don't have to

278
00:12:38,830 --> 00:12:44,440
do that we walk in the door and the guy

279
00:12:40,450 --> 00:12:46,660
that's messing up is always that there's

280
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:47,980
the one that looks ya room of 60 people

281
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:55,000
and there's one dude who turns around

282
00:12:47,980 --> 00:13:00,790
then goes and you're like stop I see you

283
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:02,350
I just need you to know so yeah so I

284
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:04,240
mentioned the dashboards and one of the

285
00:13:02,350 --> 00:13:06,850
things one of the ways that we do see it

286
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:09,550
is is oh I pee

287
00:13:06,850 --> 00:13:11,950
oh I pee is where we get our initial

288
00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:13,180
visual indication of what's going on on

289
00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:16,600
the network

290
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:20,410
Green is tcp red is UDP and white is

291
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:22,750
ICMP you can see there are larger or

292
00:13:20,410 --> 00:13:25,120
thicker bars there I'm not gonna have it

293
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:27,790
repeat but we'll save that for the fun

294
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:29,800
one but you'll see some of them are

295
00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:31,630
thicker that's just an increase in the

296
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:34,750
amount of traffic right so if we see

297
00:13:31,630 --> 00:13:36,459
those get larger and larger like they're

298
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:38,260
like what that's interesting what's

299
00:13:36,459 --> 00:13:42,279
going on there we can take the IP

300
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:43,720
address or host we run over to RSA and

301
00:13:42,279 --> 00:13:45,310
net witness and we're like hey will you

302
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:48,190
just take a look and see what's going on

303
00:13:45,310 --> 00:13:50,589
there and it's like oh it's fine or you

304
00:13:48,190 --> 00:13:53,860
know they're dossing the hell out of

305
00:13:50,589 --> 00:13:57,100
something so happens all the time the

306
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:59,350
the other dashboards on the side are are

307
00:13:57,100 --> 00:14:01,060
just intelligence basically like some

308
00:13:59,350 --> 00:14:03,339
different stats on different things that

309
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:05,739
we keep on the boards inside the knot

310
00:14:03,339 --> 00:14:07,600
you could actually walk in if you didn't

311
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:09,040
walk into the NOC you could walk in you

312
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:10,930
just couldn't go past the glass like

313
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:12,689
Alan the security guy would hit you with

314
00:14:10,930 --> 00:14:16,599
his elbow and you would immediately

315
00:14:12,690 --> 00:14:21,010
regret it he got very aggressive and

316
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:22,600
I'll share why in a second so so yeah so

317
00:14:21,010 --> 00:14:23,950
that all that information all those

318
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:25,750
dashboards were act they're actually

319
00:14:23,950 --> 00:14:28,779
real like we use the data that are on

320
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:30,010
the dashboards there they tell us things

321
00:14:28,779 --> 00:14:33,130
like you know

322
00:14:30,010 --> 00:14:34,780
on the left there is our you know

323
00:14:33,130 --> 00:14:36,850
automation piece or and we're

324
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:38,980
aggregating or orchestration we're

325
00:14:36,850 --> 00:14:40,510
aggregating data about incidents from

326
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:42,100
all of the different partners and

327
00:14:40,510 --> 00:14:43,780
pulling it under one incident so when

328
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:45,460
something happens we have all the data

329
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:48,699
from all different devices pulled into

330
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:50,980
one place even as much as as I mentioned

331
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:53,440
where we know what room you're in we can

332
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:55,060
have the floor plan show us like it's in

333
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:57,190
this room so we don't even have to think

334
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:59,109
about it like go left and then go down

335
00:14:57,190 --> 00:15:03,240
to tours like it's right there do you

336
00:14:59,110 --> 00:15:06,370
when it comes to not thinking that's us

337
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:08,170
on the right here is all of the the core

338
00:15:06,370 --> 00:15:09,670
infrastructure or the wireless so if a

339
00:15:08,170 --> 00:15:11,860
switch goes inactive or whatever it

340
00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:14,800
turns red we're like ah and we go

341
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:20,410
running off and do something about it so

342
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:22,839
I mentioned the security making sure you

343
00:15:20,410 --> 00:15:24,790
didn't go past the glass and and so we

344
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:26,770
always have like a hired security guard

345
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:29,709
that just make sure things are

346
00:15:26,770 --> 00:15:32,470
authorized people are only going into

347
00:15:29,710 --> 00:15:36,130
the knot but this year a trainer asked

348
00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:39,580
us snow if you're familiar with snow she

349
00:15:36,130 --> 00:15:43,510
has a engagement full-scope social

350
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:46,360
engineering class and she said hey can I

351
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:52,590
put something in the NOC and then see if

352
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:55,150
anybody can get it and I was like what

353
00:15:52,590 --> 00:15:56,650
and she's like I just you know like it

354
00:15:55,150 --> 00:15:58,870
will put some type of object and there a

355
00:15:56,650 --> 00:16:01,030
trophy of some kind and if they can get

356
00:15:58,870 --> 00:16:02,740
past like security or your guys or

357
00:16:01,030 --> 00:16:04,660
whatever and they get it then you know

358
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:08,710
they like they get kudos in the class

359
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:12,400
and I was like yeah sure why not

360
00:16:08,710 --> 00:16:15,910
I mean what's security hello bad ideas

361
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:17,740
so yeah so we we have it an actual

362
00:16:15,910 --> 00:16:19,240
document that you know was the

363
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:21,790
get-out-of-jail-free card with all the

364
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:23,530
information Bart myselfs know signed it

365
00:16:21,790 --> 00:16:25,270
you know this so they had it on them

366
00:16:23,530 --> 00:16:29,410
should they get tackled or elbowed in

367
00:16:25,270 --> 00:16:31,270
the face by how and it happens red

368
00:16:29,410 --> 00:16:38,020
teamers know you've been thrown to the

369
00:16:31,270 --> 00:16:39,880
ground before and so they they were then

370
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:44,240
given 24 hours to go ahead and try to

371
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:47,029
get in within five minutes

372
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:49,279
of the 24 hours given so it was from the

373
00:16:47,029 --> 00:16:51,980
time the class broke on one day until

374
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:55,910
the end of the day the next day they

375
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:57,770
were given a picture of a clipboard with

376
00:16:55,910 --> 00:17:00,920
a folder on it and it said grifters

377
00:16:57,770 --> 00:17:03,140
don't touch and so they were sent this

378
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:04,579
picture and email one of the guys walked

379
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:06,530
in with a picture on his phone showed

380
00:17:04,579 --> 00:17:07,909
the security guard said grifter said I

381
00:17:06,530 --> 00:17:10,609
should come pick this up and he was like

382
00:17:07,910 --> 00:17:13,720
oh if that is right there and he walked

383
00:17:10,609 --> 00:17:13,719
in and picked it up and walked out

384
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:20,009
[Applause]

385
00:17:16,730 --> 00:17:20,009
[Music]

386
00:17:20,970 --> 00:17:26,350
right right

387
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:31,690
and I like I turned and I could see him

388
00:17:26,349 --> 00:17:34,090
walking out and I was like oh no so I

389
00:17:31,690 --> 00:17:35,289
leaned over to see where the clipboard

390
00:17:34,090 --> 00:17:38,439
was sitting because it was just inside

391
00:17:35,289 --> 00:17:42,460
the knock on the table next to Lyle the

392
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:44,039
knock mascot and and it was gone and I

393
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:46,330
was like damn it

394
00:17:44,039 --> 00:17:49,658
so I was like what and I was like we

395
00:17:46,330 --> 00:17:52,299
just got owned and then the security

396
00:17:49,659 --> 00:17:54,909
guard was like oh no what what and I was

397
00:17:52,299 --> 00:17:56,830
like we just yes not Allen this one was

398
00:17:54,909 --> 00:17:58,330
not Allen a security guard who was at

399
00:17:56,830 --> 00:18:00,010
the door was like not that he was

400
00:17:58,330 --> 00:18:04,570
replaced or we didn't kill him or like

401
00:18:00,010 --> 00:18:06,669
yeah but he panicked and was like I can

402
00:18:04,570 --> 00:18:09,939
get my supervisor will write up a thing

403
00:18:06,669 --> 00:18:13,090
will do and I was like oh chill this is

404
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:18,279
what we do like this is just us having

405
00:18:13,090 --> 00:18:19,809
fun so so yeah so I was like damn but

406
00:18:18,279 --> 00:18:21,070
now the security guards were onto it

407
00:18:19,809 --> 00:18:23,408
right so they were really checking

408
00:18:21,070 --> 00:18:26,678
everybody as they came in let me see

409
00:18:23,409 --> 00:18:29,679
where's my my NOC badge you got it there

410
00:18:26,679 --> 00:18:31,890
we go so everybody at blackhat was

411
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:34,600
wearing these these little badges right

412
00:18:31,890 --> 00:18:36,520
and we were like oh that's cute it has

413
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:39,520
my picture on it and like a black hat

414
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:41,049
logo that's not hard to duplicate but

415
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:45,070
sure we'll wear it because you told us

416
00:18:41,049 --> 00:18:46,629
to but the class figure that out really

417
00:18:45,070 --> 00:18:48,370
quickly - there's some really basic

418
00:18:46,630 --> 00:18:52,000
things to put on here so they were like

419
00:18:48,370 --> 00:18:54,729
we'll make our own and so two guys came

420
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:57,460
strutting into the NOC now showing their

421
00:18:54,730 --> 00:19:00,909
bad to the alert more alert security

422
00:18:57,460 --> 00:19:04,059
guard and they didn't know where the

423
00:19:00,909 --> 00:19:05,799
trophy was done no recon so they just

424
00:19:04,059 --> 00:19:06,730
got in and then they were standing in

425
00:19:05,799 --> 00:19:08,000
the middle of the NOC like

426
00:19:06,730 --> 00:19:10,340
[Applause]

427
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,760
[Music]

428
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:15,959
Hey

429
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:19,710
they were you see in the clipboard we're

430
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:22,320
like hell are you you know I'm there we

431
00:19:19,710 --> 00:19:24,929
were looking for the clipboard we're

432
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:26,639
like all right you know like let me see

433
00:19:24,929 --> 00:19:29,370
your badge and one of the guys like

434
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:32,250
picks up his badge and they had only put

435
00:19:29,370 --> 00:19:36,780
the picture on one side so then Fink was

436
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:39,720
like nice try try again and off they

437
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:41,879
went but yeah so that's what repeatedly

438
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:43,830
happened for the next 24 hours 32

439
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:47,040
students kept trying to get into the

440
00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:49,678
knob the security guards are not were

441
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:52,139
losing their freakin minds they were

442
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:54,300
just like like I walked in one morning

443
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:56,460
and I'm walking in I've got the van

444
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:58,950
management you know magnet one on I've

445
00:19:56,460 --> 00:20:01,730
got this on the guy has seen me for the

446
00:19:58,950 --> 00:20:05,280
last four days he says hi grifter

447
00:20:01,730 --> 00:20:07,050
where's that grabs my badge and hits it

448
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:09,330
with a UV light because it actually

449
00:20:07,050 --> 00:20:11,520
there's a little watermark on here that

450
00:20:09,330 --> 00:20:17,100
glows under a black light and so then he

451
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:18,860
was like okay lesson learned

452
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:21,600
right what I mean it was cool because

453
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:23,850
apparently we had poor security and it

454
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:27,149
got better so yeah there we go worked

455
00:20:23,850 --> 00:20:30,360
out and we're go actually sent us a pen

456
00:20:27,150 --> 00:20:34,500
test report and and then she said you'll

457
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:40,649
get my bill later she was like 32 people

458
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:42,990
times this much an hour but anyway let's

459
00:20:40,650 --> 00:20:46,370
talk about some stat D&S I'm getting fun

460
00:20:42,990 --> 00:20:48,870
stuff now so DNS has grown every year

461
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:50,489
quite a bit more last year than the year

462
00:20:48,870 --> 00:20:52,379
prior but again last year is the first

463
00:20:50,490 --> 00:20:55,440
year that we had a 210 gig circuits so

464
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:58,559
10x bandwidth there was definitely more

465
00:20:55,440 --> 00:21:00,900
bandwidth or excuse me more DNS so 2017

466
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:02,460
21 million requests up to almost 40

467
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:05,160
million by the end of last year and then

468
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:07,260
we just pulled those stats in about 49

469
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:08,670
million and the interesting thing and we

470
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:11,400
put the graph up here and we always

471
00:21:08,670 --> 00:21:12,870
talked about it but well a I mean look

472
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:15,730
at the trainings days you can see

473
00:21:12,870 --> 00:21:18,039
exactly when lunches

474
00:21:15,730 --> 00:21:19,899
and then all those spikes are usually

475
00:21:18,039 --> 00:21:22,179
the fun stuff getting downloaded right

476
00:21:19,899 --> 00:21:25,870
after lunch but look at the different

477
00:21:22,179 --> 00:21:28,179
peaks versus briefing so we have less

478
00:21:25,870 --> 00:21:29,949
people here for trainings but they're

479
00:21:28,179 --> 00:21:32,440
almost forced to use the network at that

480
00:21:29,950 --> 00:21:33,909
point obviously to do labs and stuff but

481
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:35,169
then all you other guys get here like

482
00:21:33,909 --> 00:21:38,529
there's no way in hell

483
00:21:35,169 --> 00:21:40,779
so always interesting to look at that

484
00:21:38,529 --> 00:21:42,940
there's dns for the year so nearly 50

485
00:21:40,779 --> 00:21:45,070
million DNS requests yeah those lower

486
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:50,799
bumps are the not a chance

487
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:52,570
yeah so so we always look at encrypted

488
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:54,179
versus unencrypted traffic or the type

489
00:21:52,570 --> 00:21:57,220
of encrypted traffic that we're seeing

490
00:21:54,179 --> 00:21:59,110
you can see there I guess I will say I

491
00:21:57,220 --> 00:22:00,490
don't have the pie charts like we did

492
00:21:59,110 --> 00:22:02,320
last year whatever but I did look at

493
00:22:00,490 --> 00:22:04,659
these numbers and some other stuff to

494
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:06,879
try to infer essentially what the amount

495
00:22:04,659 --> 00:22:09,190
of encrypted traffic was last year we

496
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:11,440
saw it was roughly 70% it looks like the

497
00:22:09,190 --> 00:22:13,750
same this year so for several years

498
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:16,360
before that it was about 5% more

499
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:18,250
encrypted traffic year-over-year but it

500
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:20,529
looks like we're we're about in the same

501
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:24,279
spot we were last year if not a hair

502
00:22:20,529 --> 00:22:25,809
better but yeah one of the one of the

503
00:22:24,279 --> 00:22:27,159
more interesting things about encrypted

504
00:22:25,809 --> 00:22:28,990
and unencrypted traffic is that we

505
00:22:27,159 --> 00:22:31,419
compared it not necessarily year to year

506
00:22:28,990 --> 00:22:35,159
but show to show so region to region is

507
00:22:31,419 --> 00:22:37,419
very intriguing to us Asia is almost

508
00:22:35,159 --> 00:22:39,639
it's always the highest amount of

509
00:22:37,419 --> 00:22:41,769
encrypted traffic in the 90 percentile

510
00:22:39,639 --> 00:22:43,840
basically of traffic that's encrypted I

511
00:22:41,769 --> 00:22:45,250
think 90th somewhere there nine percent

512
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:47,860
ninety plus and then what's what's

513
00:22:45,250 --> 00:22:50,139
Europe again Europe ends up being about

514
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:51,969
the same about the same as the u.s. so

515
00:22:50,139 --> 00:22:53,439
it's interesting just how that goes we

516
00:22:51,970 --> 00:22:55,179
always talk about it obviously and you

517
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:56,440
know protect yourself for secret

518
00:22:55,179 --> 00:22:57,970
practitioners but it's but it's

519
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:59,559
definitely intriguing to see how this

520
00:22:57,970 --> 00:23:01,240
changes here to year and even region to

521
00:22:59,559 --> 00:23:03,460
region yeah I did talk to a couple local

522
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:04,809
guys at the Asia show this year to say

523
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:06,880
like hey you know we noticed you guys

524
00:23:04,809 --> 00:23:08,769
encrypt almost all of your traffic like

525
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:10,299
like why is that they're just better

526
00:23:08,769 --> 00:23:11,860
education here or whatever and he was

527
00:23:10,299 --> 00:23:16,690
like no we just inherently don't trust

528
00:23:11,860 --> 00:23:19,250
our government I was like why are we

529
00:23:16,690 --> 00:23:22,410
trusting our government

530
00:23:19,250 --> 00:23:26,340
they're like drop 30% of us trust our

531
00:23:22,410 --> 00:23:28,710
government but yeah I was like oh okay

532
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:32,070
you know it makes sense so you can see a

533
00:23:28,710 --> 00:23:34,140
lot of a TLS 11.2 and then there's like

534
00:23:32,070 --> 00:23:37,139
little smattering in there one one and

535
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:38,670
one oh and then some SSL three I'm just

536
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:39,000
hoping those are labs I'm hoping they're

537
00:23:38,670 --> 00:23:45,480
labs

538
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:50,400
ish so these are our stats around

539
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:53,520
malware you can see that we we flag a

540
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:56,670
lot of things right if we see something

541
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:59,250
interesting or it gets a high risk score

542
00:23:56,670 --> 00:24:01,100
from from RSA net witness we'll feed it

543
00:23:59,250 --> 00:24:03,630
into Cisco's threat career they

544
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:05,879
detonated in their sandbox we see how it

545
00:24:03,630 --> 00:24:07,590
functions or if there are just file

546
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:09,600
types that were interested in like as

547
00:24:07,590 --> 00:24:11,580
their things embedded in PDFs that kind

548
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:13,560
of thing or just X Cuba's DLLs that kind

549
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:16,350
of stuff will just pump it into threat

550
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:21,780
grid and see what it does so you can see

551
00:24:16,350 --> 00:24:24,449
that there were a total of nearly 85,000

552
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:28,860
events so something that made us go take

553
00:24:24,450 --> 00:24:31,950
a look and then in total just just above

554
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:34,260
4,000 files process there's a lot of

555
00:24:31,950 --> 00:24:38,190
malware I don't know if you guys know

556
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:41,400
that but there is you guys like keep

557
00:24:38,190 --> 00:24:43,620
tiny little zhuzh on your laptops and

558
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:47,580
just fire them at different things it's

559
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:49,919
it's great we'll get into a specific

560
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:51,689
example of that here and I gotta watch

561
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:54,380
the gif first that's the best part but

562
00:24:51,690 --> 00:24:56,400
and then it doesn't happen wait so

563
00:24:54,380 --> 00:24:57,420
basically the evolution the NOC we

564
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:59,250
talked about it a little bit every year

565
00:24:57,420 --> 00:25:01,110
and your - I mentioned beginning today a

566
00:24:59,250 --> 00:25:02,850
little bit about how it's growing

567
00:25:01,110 --> 00:25:08,250
obviously from when he started with

568
00:25:02,850 --> 00:25:09,990
1,500 people to near 20,000 now it's

569
00:25:08,250 --> 00:25:11,700
obviously changed quite a bit from from

570
00:25:09,990 --> 00:25:13,860
having to do the open source stuff and

571
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:16,110
trying to build that reliability and

572
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:19,409
things into that that we didn't have

573
00:25:16,110 --> 00:25:21,270
before the evolution has really come

574
00:25:19,410 --> 00:25:23,100
I wouldn't say full circle because it's

575
00:25:21,270 --> 00:25:25,050
always gonna be changing but basically

576
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:28,350
between our guys and our team and the

577
00:25:25,050 --> 00:25:30,110
partners we've gotten through and as we

578
00:25:28,350 --> 00:25:32,149
talked about a little bit with the

579
00:25:30,110 --> 00:25:33,949
trainings and wireless the

580
00:25:32,150 --> 00:25:36,200
of that has really come a long way and

581
00:25:33,950 --> 00:25:38,050
we can offer that and be confident that

582
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:40,850
that you guys as attendees will be

583
00:25:38,050 --> 00:25:42,110
stable and secure as well so as we go

584
00:25:40,850 --> 00:25:45,350
through this everything here obviously

585
00:25:42,110 --> 00:25:47,300
was was very purposeful and and

586
00:25:45,350 --> 00:25:49,610
obviously had an intent of what we were

587
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:52,070
trying to provide getting through the

588
00:25:49,610 --> 00:25:53,570
stability and security obviously always

589
00:25:52,070 --> 00:25:55,610
changing things are always changing

590
00:25:53,570 --> 00:25:57,260
products are changing attacks are

591
00:25:55,610 --> 00:26:00,320
changing etc so that's always kind of

592
00:25:57,260 --> 00:26:01,879
evolving segmentation obviously that's a

593
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:03,590
big deal and where that changes between

594
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:05,300
classrooms the type of classrooms we

595
00:26:03,590 --> 00:26:06,889
have as we kind of bleed some of the

596
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:09,220
other events into each other throughout

597
00:26:06,890 --> 00:26:11,390
the days that changes for us quite a bit

598
00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:12,620
but honestly I think one of the biggest

599
00:26:11,390 --> 00:26:14,390
things that we've really benefited from

600
00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:16,100
his threat hunting with RSA and that in

601
00:26:14,390 --> 00:26:18,710
the NOC and basically them digging

602
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:20,240
through all that data that we have as

603
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:22,160
opposed to just having it and saying

604
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:24,260
this is amazing data we can actually

605
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:27,470
find interesting stuff and find things

606
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:30,620
to be concerned about and the

607
00:26:27,470 --> 00:26:32,810
segmentation piece was was born of like

608
00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:35,810
years ago at this point feels like many

609
00:26:32,810 --> 00:26:37,730
years ago at caesars like mostly the

610
00:26:35,810 --> 00:26:40,010
network was flat right we didn't do a

611
00:26:37,730 --> 00:26:41,570
lot of segmentation until the training

612
00:26:40,010 --> 00:26:44,450
classes the numbers of training classes

613
00:26:41,570 --> 00:26:46,700
started to grow we had one class that

614
00:26:44,450 --> 00:26:48,970
was an offensive class and they like

615
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:52,670
looked over at the class that was like

616
00:26:48,970 --> 00:26:55,310
you know human factors in managing

617
00:26:52,670 --> 00:26:57,500
security and they were like when you put

618
00:26:55,310 --> 00:27:00,470
them in room next to each other and they

619
00:26:57,500 --> 00:27:03,560
just like destroyed this and we're like

620
00:27:00,470 --> 00:27:04,940
they're not your lab but guys you can't

621
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:06,520
do that and they're like well we didn't

622
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:10,250
leave the network we're like a

623
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:12,620
segmentation and then you know we

624
00:27:10,250 --> 00:27:14,210
decided okay well let's take a look at

625
00:27:12,620 --> 00:27:16,459
the traffic what's happening what can we

626
00:27:14,210 --> 00:27:18,200
find that's interesting on here and

627
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:20,690
that's when we decided to bring in the

628
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:24,380
hunting peaks and the hunting portion is

629
00:27:20,690 --> 00:27:27,560
provided by RSA by net witness the

630
00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:30,980
sandbox sang again or cisco threat grade

631
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:33,350
or glovebox to be able to interact with

632
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:35,000
the malware that we see and see what it

633
00:27:33,350 --> 00:27:36,020
does and hopefully learn something from

634
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:39,500
it

635
00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:41,570
we decided endpoint would be nice to

636
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:44,120
have on all the registration machines or

637
00:27:41,570 --> 00:27:45,320
any like publicly facing machine that

638
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:48,979
was interacted with

639
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:51,919
by you you people so we just wanted to

640
00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:54,670
see what was going on on there and then

641
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:58,430
with all of those pieces in place

642
00:27:54,670 --> 00:28:01,060
obviously you know it's it's the hot

643
00:27:58,430 --> 00:28:03,530
thing kids if you were on the expo floor

644
00:28:01,060 --> 00:28:07,490
automation automation automation right

645
00:28:03,530 --> 00:28:09,680
so speaking of automation so so this is

646
00:28:07,490 --> 00:28:11,390
one of our bigger projects that took a

647
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:14,600
few shows and that's another thing to

648
00:28:11,390 --> 00:28:16,520
kind of reiterate we certainly do work

649
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:18,230
on some of the regional shows trying to

650
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:20,840
get things perfected to use here at the

651
00:28:18,230 --> 00:28:22,700
US show obviously a scale but basically

652
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:24,709
the automation and we'll get into how

653
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:25,970
this works in just a second one of the

654
00:28:24,710 --> 00:28:29,570
big things that we did we actually took

655
00:28:25,970 --> 00:28:31,190
a survey off hand last year asking if

656
00:28:29,570 --> 00:28:34,040
you guys wanted to see and be notified

657
00:28:31,190 --> 00:28:37,640
if we saw clear text passwords crypto

658
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:39,139
mining or situ from your machines so

659
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:40,490
basically that was implemented hopefully

660
00:28:39,140 --> 00:28:42,020
you didn't have to see one of those pop

661
00:28:40,490 --> 00:28:44,450
ups basically it's a captive portal

662
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:47,900
that's provided by Palo Alto

663
00:28:44,450 --> 00:28:50,240
once you add it into a user group but

664
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:52,400
basically that's one of the biggest

665
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:54,950
issues that that brought or that brought

666
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:56,060
that forward was we can walk into a

667
00:28:54,950 --> 00:28:57,940
training room and again we know where

668
00:28:56,060 --> 00:29:00,200
you are at that point we can walk in and

669
00:28:57,940 --> 00:29:01,460
find out who it is when he swings around

670
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:02,540
when they open the door but during

671
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:04,190
briefings when everybody's just on

672
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:06,350
wireless we have a general idea

673
00:29:04,190 --> 00:29:07,310
obviously based off of access points we

674
00:29:06,350 --> 00:29:09,740
wanted to be able to provide this

675
00:29:07,310 --> 00:29:11,780
information to you guys without having

676
00:29:09,740 --> 00:29:14,300
to tap your shoulder in the hallway so

677
00:29:11,780 --> 00:29:17,030
yeah hopefully you didn't see it but if

678
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:18,530
you did hopefully it's also helpful so

679
00:29:17,030 --> 00:29:21,110
you can see the screenshots here from

680
00:29:18,530 --> 00:29:22,820
Europe 2018 that's the first place we

681
00:29:21,110 --> 00:29:25,850
actually rolled it out so we rolled out

682
00:29:22,820 --> 00:29:27,860
the the notifications you know to Bart's

683
00:29:25,850 --> 00:29:29,840
point it's better for you to get that on

684
00:29:27,860 --> 00:29:32,090
your phone than for us to like step into

685
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:34,790
like the black hat store and be like MAC

686
00:29:32,090 --> 00:29:37,310
address whatever are you here you know

687
00:29:34,790 --> 00:29:40,520
and then be like you have crypto mining

688
00:29:37,310 --> 00:29:43,730
but but yeah we're we're just trying to

689
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:45,020
inform you you know and hopefully and I

690
00:29:43,730 --> 00:29:47,120
mean I think it's worked we've had

691
00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:48,530
people respond we get emails back they

692
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:50,389
say like what did you see we've had

693
00:29:48,530 --> 00:29:51,800
people come back to the NOC we show them

694
00:29:50,390 --> 00:29:53,690
the traffic that we saw that was

695
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:54,530
malicious told people their passwords

696
00:29:53,690 --> 00:29:56,870
when they don't believe us

697
00:29:54,530 --> 00:29:58,100
yeah clear text accountant tarantulas

698
00:29:56,870 --> 00:30:00,049
that's always fun because they're like

699
00:29:58,100 --> 00:30:03,020
no I'm not doing that and we're like

700
00:30:00,049 --> 00:30:07,460
here is your password like I am doing

701
00:30:03,020 --> 00:30:09,320
that so so yeah so this is nice because

702
00:30:07,460 --> 00:30:11,270
as we see things we can just roll it out

703
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:13,399
the person is immediately informed that

704
00:30:11,270 --> 00:30:16,340
there's something amiss and they can

705
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:18,520
take some kind of action so so the way

706
00:30:16,340 --> 00:30:21,500
that it works is when we see something

707
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:23,570
we're identifying it through net witness

708
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:27,020
so through the full packet capture you

709
00:30:23,570 --> 00:30:29,539
know and then we work with Palo Alto to

710
00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:31,520
help like enrich that data give us more

711
00:30:29,539 --> 00:30:34,760
context around it was actually happening

712
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:38,059
there if it does in fact look like it's

713
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:42,408
bad it goes to the orchestration or

714
00:30:38,059 --> 00:30:46,250
automation piece at that point we have a

715
00:30:42,409 --> 00:30:49,250
check in there where Bart and myself get

716
00:30:46,250 --> 00:30:52,220
an email that says we've detected this

717
00:30:49,250 --> 00:30:53,110
on this device would you like to send

718
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:56,090
them an email

719
00:30:53,110 --> 00:30:57,530
letting them know or or a captive portal

720
00:30:56,090 --> 00:31:00,139
pop up or whatever a message letting

721
00:30:57,530 --> 00:31:02,960
them know and we say yes or no that's

722
00:31:00,140 --> 00:31:04,280
just there because one its new and we

723
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:07,549
don't want it to be something where it's

724
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:10,250
just like oh this piece decided and it's

725
00:31:07,549 --> 00:31:11,780
in its automation to flag everybody at

726
00:31:10,250 --> 00:31:13,580
the conference and send them an email

727
00:31:11,780 --> 00:31:17,780
saying that they have malware and then

728
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:23,240
we're lynched in the NOC so lock the

729
00:31:17,780 --> 00:31:25,158
doors lock the doors house so we talked

730
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:26,870
about that a little bit of the you know

731
00:31:25,159 --> 00:31:28,370
what's going on there we're taking

732
00:31:26,870 --> 00:31:32,989
something from net witness we're passing

733
00:31:28,370 --> 00:31:36,049
it to two Palo Alto they're enriching

734
00:31:32,990 --> 00:31:39,440
the data it gets passed to the back end

735
00:31:36,049 --> 00:31:41,179
for automation is de misto and so it

736
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:43,909
gets passed to the de misto piece and

737
00:31:41,179 --> 00:31:46,429
then that goes out so you can see this

738
00:31:43,909 --> 00:31:49,400
is essentially how data flows around the

739
00:31:46,429 --> 00:31:53,059
knot for one of those incidents there is

740
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:54,230
an immense amount of collaboration

741
00:31:53,059 --> 00:31:55,970
between all the partners it's been

742
00:31:54,230 --> 00:31:57,620
really cool to watch over the years that

743
00:31:55,970 --> 00:31:58,940
has they've sat next to each other they

744
00:31:57,620 --> 00:32:01,908
like leaned over and they're like is

745
00:31:58,940 --> 00:32:04,150
that what we send you that's what our

746
00:32:01,909 --> 00:32:07,610
data looks like when you talk to us

747
00:32:04,150 --> 00:32:10,530
that's terrible

748
00:32:07,610 --> 00:32:12,809
we'll fix that you know and then they go

749
00:32:10,530 --> 00:32:15,870
back and actually normally by the next

750
00:32:12,809 --> 00:32:17,399
show we have something cleaner right

751
00:32:15,870 --> 00:32:19,110
they're actually working together to

752
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:22,530
make things better which is really

753
00:32:19,110 --> 00:32:23,129
really nice to see it's been amazing it

754
00:32:22,530 --> 00:32:24,690
unguessed

755
00:32:23,130 --> 00:32:28,080
or it's super good Oh so we're gonna

756
00:32:24,690 --> 00:32:30,090
give you a couple of stories now so it's

757
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:31,740
story time we're only gonna do a few and

758
00:32:30,090 --> 00:32:33,360
then we're gonna roll into questions and

759
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:35,520
you can either get the hell out of here

760
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:38,129
and go to DEFCON or something or you can

761
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:41,309
stick around while we ramble some more

762
00:32:38,130 --> 00:32:43,799
so so I just called this slide security

763
00:32:41,309 --> 00:32:45,360
or something like it we we call

764
00:32:43,799 --> 00:32:47,400
everybody else out so we just kind of

765
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:49,350
wanted to yeah we call everybody out

766
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:51,240
whenever it does we put funny things up

767
00:32:49,350 --> 00:32:56,730
on a slide and all that kind of stuff so

768
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:58,470
I guess it's our turn so we hired a like

769
00:32:56,730 --> 00:33:00,150
a private security company right to help

770
00:32:58,470 --> 00:33:01,679
take care of security to try to increase

771
00:33:00,150 --> 00:33:03,630
it around that's why he was willing to

772
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:07,559
let you out this year to that old story

773
00:33:03,630 --> 00:33:09,210
their age yeah it's a like but you know

774
00:33:07,559 --> 00:33:15,000
there were guys like earpiece Explorer

775
00:33:09,210 --> 00:33:18,840
it was adorable and so like the the main

776
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:22,620
dude what sent out the entire security

777
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:24,659
plan for blackhat with pictures of what

778
00:33:22,620 --> 00:33:27,209
the badges looked like and the staff

779
00:33:24,660 --> 00:33:29,100
shirts and what you would do if this and

780
00:33:27,210 --> 00:33:30,870
this happened and all that stuff all in

781
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:33,240
the clear which is totally okay view

782
00:33:30,870 --> 00:33:34,830
sends to his people but he did it on the

783
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:39,210
black hat Network yeah he did it on the

784
00:33:34,830 --> 00:33:42,178
Wi-Fi and here we're like oh dude what

785
00:33:39,210 --> 00:33:45,000
are you doing what what are you doing

786
00:33:42,179 --> 00:33:46,980
dude what I thought was funny is in that

787
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:50,370
plan you will you will find this quote

788
00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:56,130
they hack anything and everything not

789
00:33:50,370 --> 00:34:00,209
maliciously but for the fun of it yeah

790
00:33:56,130 --> 00:34:06,120
so at the hackers it was great yeah we

791
00:34:00,210 --> 00:34:07,770
like that though we're like guys this is

792
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:10,710
this is we talked about it and again a

793
00:34:07,770 --> 00:34:12,509
big big piece of this had to do with the

794
00:34:10,710 --> 00:34:14,730
bandwidth people start to bang on things

795
00:34:12,510 --> 00:34:16,350
but in particular this year we had a

796
00:34:14,730 --> 00:34:17,600
training room that all of a sudden we

797
00:34:16,350 --> 00:34:20,060
saw them

798
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:26,120
doing some recon on a law enforcement

799
00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:33,830
website and then trying to exploit it

800
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:35,690
and I was like the cops that's what you

801
00:34:33,830 --> 00:34:38,150
thought you should do with your new

802
00:34:35,690 --> 00:34:40,639
skill set you were like where where

803
00:34:38,150 --> 00:34:43,550
could I try this not the lab environment

804
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:46,489
created in this class not any other lab

805
00:34:43,550 --> 00:34:48,190
environment in this giant conference of

806
00:34:46,489 --> 00:34:54,319
Awesomeness

807
00:34:48,190 --> 00:34:59,840
the cop and I'm like I was looking than

808
00:34:54,320 --> 00:35:03,410
trying to exploit its equal they were

809
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:05,980
very bad at it they were so bad I was

810
00:35:03,410 --> 00:35:09,859
like beer and you weren't here you know

811
00:35:05,980 --> 00:35:13,370
it was bad so so yeah so again we know

812
00:35:09,860 --> 00:35:15,680
where you are we went to the class we

813
00:35:13,370 --> 00:35:17,690
let the instructor know the instructors

814
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:20,270
happen to that class they provided

815
00:35:17,690 --> 00:35:21,770
laptops and they knew where everywhere

816
00:35:20,270 --> 00:35:23,540
the MAC address they were like oh that's

817
00:35:21,770 --> 00:35:28,580
that guy he's three rows back two seats

818
00:35:23,540 --> 00:35:31,820
over he sitting next to his boss I was

819
00:35:28,580 --> 00:35:34,700
like whatever right we'll be cool but

820
00:35:31,820 --> 00:35:36,140
telling the stop right and again

821
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:38,180
sometimes we just have to we will

822
00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:42,470
literally open the door lean in and be

823
00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:44,750
like stop guys it's still illegal from

824
00:35:42,470 --> 00:35:47,259
black back

825
00:35:44,750 --> 00:35:50,840
and it's light and then it stops right

826
00:35:47,260 --> 00:35:52,640
so yeah we had we had a number of those

827
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:55,099
they were they were there are quite a

828
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:57,680
few this year so I mean I've got a new

829
00:35:55,099 --> 00:36:06,530
great I'm glad everybody's learning just

830
00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:08,118
try to rein in the excitement so an

831
00:36:06,530 --> 00:36:12,380
interesting thing about airlines that

832
00:36:08,119 --> 00:36:21,590
you need not very much information to go

833
00:36:12,380 --> 00:36:24,200
change a flight yeah it's enough

834
00:36:21,590 --> 00:36:26,450
information in that email to log into

835
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:29,060
Southwest and change this person's

836
00:36:26,450 --> 00:36:30,799
flight oh I did I use the one that

837
00:36:29,060 --> 00:36:36,020
didn't have it completely really look I

838
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:37,940
left the wrong pictures on me if they

839
00:36:36,020 --> 00:36:42,380
figure out who you are that's my bad

840
00:36:37,940 --> 00:36:43,609
guys better fly home but yeah all of the

841
00:36:42,380 --> 00:36:45,380
information because we're like is this

842
00:36:43,609 --> 00:36:47,420
like what potential is there for this

843
00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:48,859
and yeah we look into their fight it's

844
00:36:47,420 --> 00:36:51,109
just a confirmation but again these are

845
00:36:48,859 --> 00:36:52,520
the things that it just subconsciously

846
00:36:51,109 --> 00:36:54,200
let's remember that everything's pretty

847
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:55,640
important at this point so if you want

848
00:36:54,200 --> 00:37:00,549
if you want to stay in Vegas and you can

849
00:36:55,640 --> 00:37:00,549
do that yeah you're coming to Def Con oh

850
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:08,330
man yeah

851
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:10,220
so this this one again another one that

852
00:37:08,330 --> 00:37:11,690
we see a lot of we're just looking at

853
00:37:10,220 --> 00:37:13,700
traffic and where we see a lot of clear

854
00:37:11,690 --> 00:37:16,369
tech stuff come through one of the

855
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:18,950
things that is a recurring theme show

856
00:37:16,369 --> 00:37:20,270
after show after show because people who

857
00:37:18,950 --> 00:37:22,759
think that they're doing the right

858
00:37:20,270 --> 00:37:26,240
things or in some cases they've done the

859
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:27,470
right things taking a picture of it are

860
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:29,689
you unless you're gonna pay the damn

861
00:37:27,470 --> 00:37:31,450
mortgage up like way to pay his mortgage

862
00:37:29,690 --> 00:37:36,890
knock it off

863
00:37:31,450 --> 00:37:37,580
come on so yeah he doesn't know that

864
00:37:36,890 --> 00:37:40,700
much I know

865
00:37:37,580 --> 00:37:43,490
so what's Benno since we had to put our

866
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:46,609
to go fund me for this dudes Morgan for

867
00:37:43,490 --> 00:37:49,520
letting us put on a slide in quite a

868
00:37:46,609 --> 00:37:51,080
party over whatever grifter finishes

869
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:51,680
store I'm scary part is he thought he

870
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:53,960
was okay

871
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:54,870
yeah so he thought that everything was

872
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:58,050
fine we went

873
00:37:54,870 --> 00:38:00,210
class was like ham like dude this like

874
00:37:58,050 --> 00:38:05,520
you are sending a lot of financial

875
00:38:00,210 --> 00:38:10,400
information in the clear no I'm not I'm

876
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:14,280
using a VPN no you're not

877
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:17,250
no I am I'm connected right now and I'm

878
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:19,260
like well your mortgage you open this

879
00:38:17,250 --> 00:38:20,550
much you live at this address and your

880
00:38:19,260 --> 00:38:27,630
password is this

881
00:38:20,550 --> 00:38:29,880
oh I'm not and so it was like holy crap

882
00:38:27,630 --> 00:38:31,620
but the client did show that he was

883
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:34,290
connected to VPN so something's not

884
00:38:31,620 --> 00:38:36,270
right there right so he believes he's

885
00:38:34,290 --> 00:38:37,950
secure and in fact he wasn't he was like

886
00:38:36,270 --> 00:38:39,630
yeah my kids and University I was

887
00:38:37,950 --> 00:38:41,310
uploading a bunch of documents for

888
00:38:39,630 --> 00:38:43,440
student loans and whatever and I thought

889
00:38:41,310 --> 00:38:48,630
that I was good I was like one don't do

890
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:50,910
that at blackhat I just you really

891
00:38:48,630 --> 00:38:53,220
really trust your VPN right I mean like

892
00:38:50,910 --> 00:38:56,250
I just got to be on this idea for a new

893
00:38:53,220 --> 00:38:58,259
VPN sites we see things like people will

894
00:38:56,250 --> 00:38:59,790
set up their you know their client order

895
00:38:58,260 --> 00:39:01,350
and they don't use the kill switch

896
00:38:59,790 --> 00:39:03,360
option so they come into a network like

897
00:39:01,350 --> 00:39:04,920
blackhat they're on everything's fine

898
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:06,810
they've been connected for a while they

899
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:08,390
drop off they don't realize that they've

900
00:39:06,810 --> 00:39:10,980
disconnected and they continue to

901
00:39:08,390 --> 00:39:12,629
function as normal and so if there's any

902
00:39:10,980 --> 00:39:14,610
traffic they would consider sensitive

903
00:39:12,630 --> 00:39:16,200
they think it's encrypted in fact it's

904
00:39:14,610 --> 00:39:18,420
not so make sure that you're using your

905
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:20,069
kill switch options we also see things

906
00:39:18,420 --> 00:39:21,540
like people using split tunneling and

907
00:39:20,070 --> 00:39:23,100
they think it's happening here but it's

908
00:39:21,540 --> 00:39:25,050
actually whoops all that data is going

909
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:27,240
out on the other side there's a lot of

910
00:39:25,050 --> 00:39:28,710
things that happen with VPNs where

911
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:31,049
people think they're secure and they're

912
00:39:28,710 --> 00:39:35,910
not so please please please trust but

913
00:39:31,050 --> 00:39:38,810
verify trust but verify oh man we're

914
00:39:35,910 --> 00:39:41,100
getting really close yeah so um yeah

915
00:39:38,810 --> 00:39:42,450
this one's so we've talked about

916
00:39:41,100 --> 00:39:43,380
interesting business models when

917
00:39:42,450 --> 00:39:45,149
everything kind of changed from

918
00:39:43,380 --> 00:39:47,160
ransomware to crypto where well this is

919
00:39:45,150 --> 00:39:49,710
kind of the next evolution so this is

920
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:51,930
actually a porn site that's how you know

921
00:39:49,710 --> 00:39:53,760
we're getting close to the end this is

922
00:39:51,930 --> 00:39:58,730
actually a porn site that's not a new

923
00:39:53,760 --> 00:40:01,470
business model I see what you did so the

924
00:39:58,730 --> 00:40:02,790
there's no ads on this porn site which

925
00:40:01,470 --> 00:40:04,439
is the only an amazing thing and there

926
00:40:02,790 --> 00:40:06,630
actually seemed like they were all

927
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:09,560
pretty long videos long overnight but he

928
00:40:06,630 --> 00:40:09,560
told us I don't know what

929
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:14,129
but in the background the one person the

930
00:40:12,210 --> 00:40:16,740
knock who has seen things that can't be

931
00:40:14,130 --> 00:40:18,540
unseen there's a part of the knock that

932
00:40:16,740 --> 00:40:24,240
doesn't have windows I checked all the

933
00:40:18,540 --> 00:40:27,000
videos not a single ad market research

934
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:30,390
so so basically in the background they

935
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:32,070
and this was they just load JavaScript

936
00:40:30,390 --> 00:40:34,740
and crypto mind the entire time you're

937
00:40:32,070 --> 00:40:36,660
watching porn so you don't get ads and

938
00:40:34,740 --> 00:40:38,609
they just get their crypto mining done

939
00:40:36,660 --> 00:40:41,190
while you do your business it's fairly

940
00:40:38,610 --> 00:40:42,450
dope I'll take that trade it was it was

941
00:40:41,190 --> 00:40:43,950
interesting no because we kind of

942
00:40:42,450 --> 00:40:45,149
thought about what how that is an

943
00:40:43,950 --> 00:40:46,980
interesting business model though

944
00:40:45,150 --> 00:40:50,130
because you've got a lot of fluctuation

945
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:55,110
yeah you're like well I know they'll be

946
00:40:50,130 --> 00:40:59,760
back every six hours eight minutes big

947
00:40:55,110 --> 00:41:04,550
data people right I'm just saying

948
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:04,550
so uh so yeah speaking of porn

949
00:41:04,780 --> 00:41:10,390
[Laughter]

950
00:41:07,690 --> 00:41:13,210
[Music]

951
00:41:10,390 --> 00:41:14,950
yeah these are these are just the

952
00:41:13,210 --> 00:41:17,500
session so we didn't get too crazy this

953
00:41:14,950 --> 00:41:18,790
year no no math calculations you guys

954
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:21,700
are just weird and we wanted to show

955
00:41:18,790 --> 00:41:25,779
that still and you paid a lot of money

956
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:29,859
to be here you nasty somebody does yeah

957
00:41:25,780 --> 00:41:32,440
it's like yeah Wow Wow

958
00:41:29,860 --> 00:41:37,210
but yeah so if you don't know some of

959
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:40,900
those sites now you do you're like wait

960
00:41:37,210 --> 00:41:45,790
what people seem to like that one

961
00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:47,800
but yeah so you we always tell ya we

962
00:41:45,790 --> 00:41:50,740
always talk about the adult content that

963
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:53,200
goes on here where no matter how many

964
00:41:50,740 --> 00:41:56,379
shows we go through and we see all these

965
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:58,200
connections to it were like always

966
00:41:56,380 --> 00:42:01,090
surprised like the only thing that

967
00:41:58,200 --> 00:42:05,890
surprises us that we're just like that

968
00:42:01,090 --> 00:42:12,160
much really - that long man they are

969
00:42:05,890 --> 00:42:14,620
mine in some Manero so that's it now

970
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:16,710
it's time for questions and you guys got

971
00:42:14,620 --> 00:42:16,710

972
00:42:16,730 --> 00:42:22,670
[Music]

[Applause]

974
00:42:24,370 --> 00:42:27,609
this question we had tons of questions

975
00:42:26,230 --> 00:42:29,380
in the smaller one so you guys have got

976
00:42:27,610 --> 00:42:32,080
some time somebody's got some everybody

977
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:41,560
always runs you're scared we just don't

978
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:43,090
want to call now alright somebody so how

979
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:44,560
do we inject the captive portals with

980
00:42:43,090 --> 00:42:45,940
encryption and stuff so you have to you

981
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:47,200
absolutely have to hit an unencrypted

982
00:42:45,940 --> 00:42:49,120
site you won't see it if everything you

983
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:50,589
hit was encrypted at that point but it's

984
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:52,240
just all done through dynamic user

985
00:42:50,590 --> 00:42:54,100
groups at that point on Paulo and added

986
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:56,109
to it so anytime they hit an unencrypted

987
00:42:54,100 --> 00:42:57,730
site at that point we'll get captive

988
00:42:56,110 --> 00:43:02,020
portal yes Andy

989
00:42:57,730 --> 00:43:08,770
right just a quick question about the

990
00:43:02,020 --> 00:43:11,470
porn which which blackhat show has the

991
00:43:08,770 --> 00:43:12,700
highest use of porn I mean this one this

992

1000
00:43:39,310 --> 00:43:41,670

hang on hang on there's somebody might

1002
00:43:44,100 --> 00:43:50,970
good have you guys seen any uptake in

1003
00:43:47,700 --> 00:43:53,040
encrypted DNS technology I couldn't

1004
00:43:50,970 --> 00:43:56,790
understand it one more time yeah did you

1005
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:58,740
did you see any optic in encrypted DNS

1006
00:43:56,790 --> 00:44:01,080
technology like yeah that's usually when

1007
00:43:58,740 --> 00:44:02,879
they're running away with your data I

1008
00:44:01,080 --> 00:44:05,520
don't think we actually seen tons of

1009
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:06,210
encrypted DNS yet no no no no not here

1010
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:12,570
sorry

1011
00:44:06,210 --> 00:44:14,400
oh we didn't this you yeah we didn't

1012
00:44:12,570 --> 00:44:16,080
deploy any honey pots this year no he

1013
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:18,810
didn't did not we've done it in the past

1014
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:20,910
but it was like WordPress on a I'm gonna

1015
00:44:18,810 --> 00:44:26,640
be honest with ya I forgot you just said

1016
00:44:20,910 --> 00:44:28,049
it and I was like oh shit you know what

1017
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:29,970
he touched it you have ever if I saw a

1018
00:44:28,050 --> 00:44:33,030
site at blackhat I wouldn't touch him

1019
00:44:29,970 --> 00:44:34,919
it's probably go ahead I forgot yeah you

1020
00:44:33,030 --> 00:44:37,260
talked about segmentation I'm curious

1021
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:40,410
what you do how far you take it to

1022
00:44:37,260 --> 00:44:41,550
protect labs against each other so so we

1023
00:44:40,410 --> 00:44:43,680
had an interesting question about this

1024
00:44:41,550 --> 00:44:45,510
earlier and to the extent that again

1025
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:47,069
it's just simple basic V landing as far

1026
00:44:45,510 --> 00:44:49,620
as that goes host isolation on the

1027
00:44:47,070 --> 00:44:52,650
wireless basically again we control all

1028
00:44:49,620 --> 00:44:54,359
of the distribution layer as well we do

1029
00:44:52,650 --> 00:44:56,640
VLAN people so in the classrooms there's

1030
00:44:54,360 --> 00:44:58,380
no host isolation on their SSID they can

1031
00:44:56,640 --> 00:45:00,120
talk to each other and then still have

1032
00:44:58,380 --> 00:45:02,310
wired infrastructure as well and be

1033
00:45:00,120 --> 00:45:04,890
within that same but then everything

1034
00:45:02,310 --> 00:45:06,930
else outside of trainings there is

1035
00:45:04,890 --> 00:45:08,759
nobody that will talk to anybody else as

1036
00:45:06,930 --> 00:45:10,529
far as as we go there but everything's

1037
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:12,800
basic there's nothing super advanced as

1038
00:45:10,530 --> 00:45:15,390
far as that goes like features with with

1039
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:19,860
anything outside of V laning at this

1040
00:45:15,390 --> 00:45:21,839
point go ahead for configuration how do

1041
00:45:19,860 --> 00:45:25,050
you configure all the network equipment

1042
00:45:21,840 --> 00:45:29,160
it's not for configuration is that we

1043
00:45:25,050 --> 00:45:31,530
said yeah how do we configure it I'm it

1044
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:33,450
like the audio really bad it's super

1045
00:45:31,530 --> 00:45:35,910
echoey in here so how do we configure

1046
00:45:33,450 --> 00:45:38,279
the equipment right right while we're on

1047
00:45:35,910 --> 00:45:40,379
site basically so myself and a small

1048
00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:42,690
skeleton crew think and a bunch of the

1049
00:45:40,380 --> 00:45:43,920
partner show up last Tuesday basically

1050
00:45:42,690 --> 00:45:45,470
and even there was even more some of the

1051
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:47,990
switch guys were here on last Monday

1052
00:45:45,470 --> 00:45:50,700
getting that put in basically we work

1053
00:45:47,990 --> 00:45:52,879
starting in about February designing

1054
00:45:50,700 --> 00:45:54,450
this together with all the partners

1055
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:56,579
configuration is done

1056
00:45:54,450 --> 00:45:59,009
some sense beforehand but a lot of it's

1057
00:45:56,579 --> 00:46:02,640
done here because everything changes

1058
00:45:59,010 --> 00:46:06,440
anyway okay follow-up question so one

1059
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:06,440
question at a time kids yeah you get

1060
00:46:07,220 --> 00:46:12,750
walk away scared

1061
00:46:09,619 --> 00:46:16,320
go ahead know what I mean do you look

1062
00:46:12,750 --> 00:46:18,060
into every equipment and push the

1063
00:46:16,320 --> 00:46:21,869
comparation there or do you do it from

1064
00:46:18,060 --> 00:46:23,549
one machine no they're pushed we don't

1065
00:46:21,869 --> 00:46:24,599
man it there's some management for

1066
00:46:23,550 --> 00:46:31,560
parallel so there's no central

1067
00:46:24,599 --> 00:46:33,599
management for the switches mm-hmm no

1068
00:46:31,560 --> 00:46:35,820
just just the Convention Center where we

1069
00:46:33,599 --> 00:46:36,960
are we take over what we need and as far

1070
00:46:35,820 --> 00:46:39,089
as that goes their equipment's still

1071
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:40,650
there obviously we just patch out and

1072
00:46:39,089 --> 00:46:41,820
deal with what we have to this side of

1073
00:46:40,650 --> 00:46:43,680
the room isn't asking question saying

1074
00:46:41,820 --> 00:46:46,430
anybody we don't unrack there's that I

1075
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:53,990
could be ridiculous I'm not very strong

1076
00:46:46,430 --> 00:47:01,140
go ahead yeah a little bit louder

1077
00:46:53,990 --> 00:47:04,290
what's that successful attacks were you

1078
00:47:01,140 --> 00:47:07,170
trying something yeah do you need like

1079
00:47:04,290 --> 00:47:08,550
disclose some area now no there's

1080
00:47:07,170 --> 00:47:10,319
nothing that I can say as far as this

1081
00:47:08,550 --> 00:47:11,609
it's kind of hard to say what a

1082
00:47:10,319 --> 00:47:13,319
successful attack I mean there was

1083
00:47:11,609 --> 00:47:15,598
plenty of labs that were popping boxes

1084
00:47:13,319 --> 00:47:17,579
you know training classes but on our

1085
00:47:15,599 --> 00:47:19,650
infrastructure and such no yeah I think

1086
00:47:17,579 --> 00:47:21,630
I wouldn't think I'd have been crying in

1087
00:47:19,650 --> 00:47:24,210
my room already if I was a kid yeah the

1088
00:47:21,630 --> 00:47:25,890
thing that annoys unknown us easily what

1089
00:47:24,210 --> 00:47:27,150
I would consider successful to a degree

1090
00:47:25,890 --> 00:47:29,848
it's just like when people are dropping

1091
00:47:27,150 --> 00:47:31,410
like you know hardware D authors and

1092
00:47:29,849 --> 00:47:33,660
planters and stuff like that there's

1093
00:47:31,410 --> 00:47:35,790
always random stuff like we have to go

1094
00:47:33,660 --> 00:47:37,529
take a look at that we had some some D

1095
00:47:35,790 --> 00:47:39,089
off issues this year as well but nothing

1096
00:47:37,530 --> 00:47:41,369
too crazy we actually had one that

1097
00:47:39,089 --> 00:47:43,650
wasn't even it wasn't intentional like

1098
00:47:41,369 --> 00:47:45,119
the guys internal wireless wasn't

1099
00:47:43,650 --> 00:47:47,339
working in his laptop and so the

1100
00:47:45,119 --> 00:47:50,369
instructors gave in had some janky ass

1101
00:47:47,339 --> 00:47:52,750
like $15 adapter the Chinese adapter

1102
00:47:50,369 --> 00:47:55,660
yeah and it was just like

1103
00:47:52,750 --> 00:47:58,270
and like I was like we had to send

1104
00:47:55,660 --> 00:47:59,980
somebody to go like we literally hunting

1105
00:47:58,270 --> 00:48:02,020
him like pointing antennas in the room

1106
00:47:59,980 --> 00:48:04,060
like someone was like a dude came in our

1107
00:48:02,020 --> 00:48:05,619
room and like pointed a director pin it

1108
00:48:04,060 --> 00:48:06,040
around and then left and we're like yeah

1109
00:48:05,619 --> 00:48:12,099
it's all right

1110
00:48:06,040 --> 00:48:13,570
just jammies go ahead so as far as the

1111
00:48:12,099 --> 00:48:15,640
data when we're done everything gets

1112
00:48:13,570 --> 00:48:16,990
wiped here and I mean our NSA is

1113
00:48:15,640 --> 00:48:19,089
actually already pulling if I'm correct

1114
00:48:16,990 --> 00:48:20,799
and that night is completely wiped there

1115
00:48:19,090 --> 00:48:24,160
is nothing that is kept from the show so

1116
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:26,290
this is everything is is a log to disk

1117
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:28,299
during the show but as soon as every

1118
00:48:26,290 --> 00:48:29,920
show ends we we wipe all that data it's

1119
00:48:28,300 --> 00:48:31,690
our data too so we've talked about that

1120
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:33,070
a little bit before and we don't we

1121
00:48:31,690 --> 00:48:34,330
don't want that done for research but

1122
00:48:33,070 --> 00:48:36,940
will laugh at you while we're here

1123
00:48:34,330 --> 00:48:39,009
yeah we like legitimately people will be

1124
00:48:36,940 --> 00:48:40,750
like oh we'll give you money if you'll

1125
00:48:39,010 --> 00:48:44,260
let us see that note that that's a

1126
00:48:40,750 --> 00:48:47,710
goldmine of data and we're like suck it

1127
00:48:44,260 --> 00:48:50,410
mine if you want a new porn site maybe

1128
00:48:47,710 --> 00:48:57,730
go ahead yeah we'll give you one guy's

1129
00:48:50,410 --> 00:49:00,430
data sweaty gonna sit you said you did a

1130
00:48:57,730 --> 00:49:03,280
manual approval on the captive portal

1131
00:49:00,430 --> 00:49:04,569
what was the false positive rate so I

1132
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:06,040
wouldn't even say that there's a huge

1133
00:49:04,570 --> 00:49:10,420
false positive rate we were measuring it

1134
00:49:06,040 --> 00:49:12,130
was more of a praten privacy again we

1135
00:49:10,420 --> 00:49:14,680
don't want to scare you guys away so we

1136
00:49:12,130 --> 00:49:16,210
didn't want those blasting out if it

1137
00:49:14,680 --> 00:49:19,060
could have been a false positive so for

1138
00:49:16,210 --> 00:49:21,369
example if all of a sudden a list of

1139
00:49:19,060 --> 00:49:23,230
5,000 users or something got added to

1140
00:49:21,369 --> 00:49:24,550
that list and it just automated all the

1141
00:49:23,230 --> 00:49:26,050
way through we wouldn't be able to say

1142
00:49:24,550 --> 00:49:28,150
well that looks a little weird so we get

1143
00:49:26,050 --> 00:49:29,200
an email I could digest of that can just

1144
00:49:28,150 --> 00:49:31,839
basically respond

1145
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:33,848
it's just that stop of a chain basically

1146
00:49:31,839 --> 00:49:35,020
to make sure that everything's good but

1147
00:49:33,849 --> 00:49:37,030
I wouldn't say that we had anything I

1148
00:49:35,020 --> 00:49:38,380
don't know of any false positives as far

1149
00:49:37,030 --> 00:49:40,060
as that with nobody who came complaining

1150
00:49:38,380 --> 00:49:41,530
to us at least so again it's more its

1151
00:49:40,060 --> 00:49:42,580
informational like we're not stopping

1152
00:49:41,530 --> 00:49:46,510
anything or doing whatever we're just

1153
00:49:42,580 --> 00:49:50,410
like hey here's a notification I had one

1154
00:49:46,510 --> 00:49:53,140
in at the London Show where a guy sent

1155
00:49:50,410 --> 00:49:54,509
me back an email he sends it to knock at

1156
00:49:53,140 --> 00:49:56,910
blackhat calm

1157
00:49:54,510 --> 00:49:58,530
which goes to I think Bart thinking hi

1158
00:49:56,910 --> 00:50:03,290
right and so if you're looking for a

1159
00:49:58,530 --> 00:50:07,290
date hmm knock abaya talking to you sir

1160
00:50:03,290 --> 00:50:08,940
you know the so the that that just goes

1161
00:50:07,290 --> 00:50:10,619
out and I had somebody come back and say

1162
00:50:08,940 --> 00:50:12,030
oh I don't think that this is actually

1163
00:50:10,619 --> 00:50:13,920
what's happening and I was like well

1164
00:50:12,030 --> 00:50:15,780
hold on and I'll grab a screenshot of

1165
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:17,099
the traffic and whatever and we and I

1166
00:50:15,780 --> 00:50:18,960
sent it back to him I said here's your

1167
00:50:17,099 --> 00:50:20,700
traffic and he was like oh yeah that's

1168
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:22,500
actually I think that's something that

1169
00:50:20,700 --> 00:50:24,450
I'm doing with like a I'm like alright

1170
00:50:22,500 --> 00:50:25,920
well fine so it looked false positive it

1171
00:50:24,450 --> 00:50:28,230
was something he intended to be taking

1172
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:30,089
place on his machine but we haven't had

1173
00:50:28,230 --> 00:50:33,349
people come in to knock like banging on

1174
00:50:30,089 --> 00:50:36,119
the glass like you're wrong knock I

1175
00:50:33,349 --> 00:50:38,069
don't have a crypto minor on there like

1176
00:50:36,119 --> 00:50:39,660
I'm if you were legitimately crypto

1177
00:50:38,069 --> 00:50:41,009
mining that's fine again it's just an

1178
00:50:39,660 --> 00:50:42,450
app nation oh we just wanted to make

1179
00:50:41,010 --> 00:50:44,700
people more aware because that's

1180
00:50:42,450 --> 00:50:46,770
obviously the new wave of inaction if

1181
00:50:44,700 --> 00:50:50,640
you will so dogecoins not gonna mind

1182
00:50:46,770 --> 00:50:53,099
itself the questions more when did you

1183
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:55,710
guys not or hit no and not let it get

1184
00:50:53,099 --> 00:50:58,290
sent to someone I haven't no never I

1185
00:50:55,710 --> 00:51:00,660
always say yes and here's why again that

1186
00:50:58,290 --> 00:51:03,299
check is really only in there so that if

1187
00:51:00,660 --> 00:51:05,540
I get an email at like one hour where

1188
00:51:03,299 --> 00:51:09,660
all of a sudden there are 4,000 entries

1189
00:51:05,540 --> 00:51:11,549
that I'm like no right and then mom's

1190
00:51:09,660 --> 00:51:14,609
book deals just to check for us to say

1191
00:51:11,549 --> 00:51:16,619
like you know no I'm out we're

1192
00:51:14,609 --> 00:51:19,890
essentially we're still nervous it's

1193
00:51:16,619 --> 00:51:24,150
only been here uhit no think it no

1194
00:51:19,890 --> 00:51:30,680
because one of them was him that's what

1195
00:51:24,150 --> 00:51:30,680
he says he just said it yeah yeah yeah

1196
00:51:31,220 --> 00:51:36,930
what's that oh he didn't actually hit

1197
00:51:35,430 --> 00:51:39,720
something I was joking he was a white

1198
00:51:36,930 --> 00:51:41,040
guy I even actually hit somebody no I

1199
00:51:39,720 --> 00:51:42,720
would like they were just ready for a

1200
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:45,000
fight at any given moment like it was

1201
00:51:42,720 --> 00:51:46,950
ridiculous like that's poor guy they

1202
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:48,079
earn their money this week they earned

1203
00:51:46,950 --> 00:51:57,359
the hell out of it

1204
00:51:48,079 --> 00:52:00,240
anybody else oh say again rogue ap's so

1205
00:51:57,359 --> 00:52:02,578
again well we have ruckus like so

1206
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:06,270
they're monitoring for for things like

1207
00:52:02,579 --> 00:52:08,040
that we also have crazy Jim so if we see

1208
00:52:06,270 --> 00:52:10,650
something and we need to invest the

1209
00:52:08,040 --> 00:52:12,210
and we'll just go out and and take care

1210
00:52:10,650 --> 00:52:15,500
we've seen plenty of those in the past

1211
00:52:12,210 --> 00:52:15,500
I'm sure there wasn't many of this year

1212
00:52:18,770 --> 00:52:22,740
we haven't gotten to like as far as

1213
00:52:21,060 --> 00:52:24,600
triangulation cut are you saying like a

1214
00:52:22,740 --> 00:52:27,930
Z the question is do we use Wi-Fi for

1215
00:52:24,600 --> 00:52:32,819
positioning or like we we don't do that

1216
00:52:27,930 --> 00:52:34,710
kind of we didn't but if you guys are

1217
00:52:32,820 --> 00:52:36,090
familiar with the Wi-Fi cactus you've

1218
00:52:34,710 --> 00:52:37,800
seen the Wi-Fi cactus for the last

1219
00:52:36,090 --> 00:52:39,360
couple years sitting in the NOC actually

1220
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:41,730
if you poked your head into the NOC this

1221
00:52:39,360 --> 00:52:43,650
year the Wi-Fi cactus wasn't there but

1222
00:52:41,730 --> 00:52:45,900
the Wi-Fi kraken was which is a new

1223
00:52:43,650 --> 00:52:48,480
project by Mike Spicer or dark matter

1224
00:52:45,900 --> 00:52:50,490
who did the Wi-Fi cactus he collected

1225
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:53,160
data from the last three years of black

1226
00:52:50,490 --> 00:52:56,520
hats wandering around passively scanning

1227
00:52:53,160 --> 00:52:58,350
and the last three def cons and he'll be

1228
00:52:56,520 --> 00:53:00,450
speaking at Def Con about all the

1229
00:52:58,350 --> 00:53:04,230
analytics that he's done including

1230
00:53:00,450 --> 00:53:07,620
positioning like he's on the main stage

1231
00:53:04,230 --> 00:53:09,690
at Def Con I'd want to say Saturday so

1232
00:53:07,620 --> 00:53:14,339
if you're interested in seeing when he

1233
00:53:09,690 --> 00:53:17,430
says Friday Friday what time for at four

1234
00:53:14,340 --> 00:53:20,580
o'clock so not at a four or five you're

1237
00:53:24,570 --> 00:53:32,370
sports I'd have no idea what's happening

1238
00:53:26,580 --> 00:53:35,360
