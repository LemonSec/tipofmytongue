for putting your phones on vibrate

17
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:41,959
it makes us easier to ignore the ringing

18
00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:45,239
Christian it's all yours Thank You Lena

19
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:48,059
hi folks good morning I'm Kristen brand

20
00:00:45,239 --> 00:00:51,899
I work on the security and identity

21
00:00:48,059 --> 00:00:54,660
teams at Google and one of my areas is

22
00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:55,770
web authentication and and Fido which I

23
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:58,190
hope to tell you a little bit more about

24
00:00:55,770 --> 00:01:00,480
in the 25 minutes we have this morning

25
00:00:58,190 --> 00:01:02,160
thank you for being here early I know

26
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:04,619
it's the first session of the day and

27
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:07,979
after last night I'm surprised to see as

28
00:01:04,619 --> 00:01:11,100
many here but this is great who here has

29
00:01:07,979 --> 00:01:16,320
heard of web authentication or Fido

30
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:17,699
before ok great great great so every

31
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:19,500
here this gets better and better I've

32
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:21,360
never spoken out a black hat before but

33
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:23,490
I get around the circuit a little bit

34
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:25,470
and it started I guess five or six years

35
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:26,850
ago with almost no one and I think now

36
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:28,890
we're roughly at the 40 or 50 percent

37
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:32,100
mark so hopefully for next year we'll

38
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:34,979
kind of keep that trajectory going so

39
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:36,390
the agenda this morning is starting with

40
00:01:34,979 --> 00:01:37,829
a little bit of background why we're

41
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:40,170
even doing this stuff like why we're

42
00:01:37,829 --> 00:01:42,000
interested in trying to solve some

43
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:44,009
problem what problem are we solving why

44
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,259
that's important I think about judging

45
00:01:44,009 --> 00:01:47,970
from you know the hands here about 40 50

46
00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:49,320
% the folks should already probably know

47
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:51,689
why we're working on this stuff but

48
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:53,908
really the the TLDR there is just

49
00:01:51,689 --> 00:01:55,589
passwords are just not enough right we

50
00:01:53,909 --> 00:01:58,710
need to do something to fix the problem

51
00:01:55,590 --> 00:02:00,210
then we'll go into the industry solution

52
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:02,100
to that problem a little bit MFA

53
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:03,658
multi-factor authentication something

54
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:06,630
industry has come up with to try and

55
00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:08,429
address this problem still not kind of

56
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:10,179
quite there if you saw Ellie's

57
00:02:08,429 --> 00:02:11,950
presentation yesterday you

58
00:02:10,179 --> 00:02:15,280
know that fishing is still a giant issue

59
00:02:11,950 --> 00:02:17,200
and even the best forms of MFA in some

60
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:18,939
cases can still be circumvented so we'll

61
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:21,429
talk a little bit about that and then

62
00:02:18,939 --> 00:02:22,689
lastly we'll talk about why you're all

63
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:24,969
here right we'll talk about web

64
00:02:22,689 --> 00:02:26,680
authentication and what we're doing to

65
00:02:24,969 --> 00:02:29,620
try and address this problem as an

66
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:33,609
industry so let's start to the first

67
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:35,319
section passwords are not enough so some

68
00:02:33,609 --> 00:02:37,030
of the statistics may be very familiar

69
00:02:35,319 --> 00:02:39,238
to you or you really have a sense for

70
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:41,769
this I mean not a week goes by today

71
00:02:39,239 --> 00:02:44,439
that we don't learn about another data

72
00:02:41,769 --> 00:02:45,790
breach somewhere so 4.3 million so forty

73
00:02:44,439 --> 00:02:47,500
three billion credential dumps our

74
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:49,030
credentials leak and dumps is something

75
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:50,769
that you know would come naturally you

76
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:52,510
think yes you're we set up the Google

77
00:02:50,769 --> 00:02:54,340
search crawl or is a while ago to kind

78
00:02:52,510 --> 00:02:56,769
of go out looking for username password

79
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:59,620
pairs and that's what we found over 4.3

80
00:02:56,769 --> 00:03:02,290
billion unique combinations online and

81
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:05,169
you know stuff that's out there and can

82
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:07,090
be used or misused in some way shape or

83
00:03:05,169 --> 00:03:08,859
form what we've also found is that

84
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:11,500
between various different websites if

85
00:03:08,859 --> 00:03:14,409
for the same user IDs passwords get

86
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:16,060
reused at a minimum about 17 percent of

87
00:03:14,409 --> 00:03:18,129
the time we actually think in practice

88
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:20,109
and that's much higher but from the data

89
00:03:18,129 --> 00:03:21,760
that we could gather about 70 percent of

90
00:03:20,109 --> 00:03:23,829
the time it turns out that users on

91
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:25,959
different services or across different

92
00:03:23,829 --> 00:03:28,599
services ends up reusing the same

93
00:03:25,959 --> 00:03:30,129
username and password Paris of course

94
00:03:28,599 --> 00:03:32,260
not great and that's why password

95
00:03:30,129 --> 00:03:34,659
managers has been you know something

96
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:35,888
that's on the rise still very low but

97
00:03:34,659 --> 00:03:37,298
you know we hope that folks will

98
00:03:35,889 --> 00:03:40,870
actually end up using these services

99
00:03:37,299 --> 00:03:42,699
more because password reuse is probably

100
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:44,919
like one of the you know kind of the

101
00:03:42,699 --> 00:03:46,329
Achilles heel right now of the the

102
00:03:44,919 --> 00:03:48,669
internet authentication industry as far

103
00:03:46,329 --> 00:03:50,229
as passwords are concerned and then I'm

104
00:03:48,669 --> 00:03:52,150
happy to report I have to run up your as

105
00:03:50,229 --> 00:03:53,409
Google right so 110 million accounts

106
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:55,810
proactively secured so what's really

107
00:03:53,409 --> 00:03:58,328
cool about us looking for these

108
00:03:55,810 --> 00:04:00,159
credential dumps is if we then see

109
00:03:58,329 --> 00:04:02,169
matching passwords for Google accounts

110
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:03,728
things that work on Google side we can

111
00:04:02,169 --> 00:04:05,439
proactively secure these accounts and

112
00:04:03,729 --> 00:04:06,849
reach out to those users to say hey your

113
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:07,810
password has been compromised somewhere

114
00:04:06,849 --> 00:04:09,310
else

115
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:11,169
and it turns out that you use the same

116
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:13,509
password here you should probably think

117
00:04:11,169 --> 00:04:14,799
about resetting the thing so you know

118
00:04:13,509 --> 00:04:16,539
things that one can do if you have

119
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:18,810
access to to all this data which

120
00:04:16,539 --> 00:04:19,988
obviously not all services do you have

121
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:22,539
again

122
00:04:19,988 --> 00:04:23,530
happy to report that even if a bad guy

123
00:04:22,539 --> 00:04:25,390
has your

124
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:27,809
Google username and password and they're

125
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:30,280
trying to use it in a you know kind of a

126
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:32,680
dive brute-force type attack against

127
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:34,570
Google trying to sign-in in over 99.9%

128
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:37,180
of the time of the cases we actually

129
00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:38,380
will not allow that attacker into your

130
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:40,420
Google account and maybe you've seen

131
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:42,610
some of these emails come by that says

132
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:44,410
hey there was just a login to your

133
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:46,570
Google account that we've blocked from

134
00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:48,880
some other place on earth we don't think

135
00:04:46,570 --> 00:04:51,430
it's legitimate click here like to reset

136
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:53,800
your Google password so we can discern

137
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:56,470
patterns from folks trying to log into

138
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:57,730
different places or logging from

139
00:04:56,470 --> 00:05:00,010
different places and using different

140
00:04:57,730 --> 00:05:02,260
techniques and when something doesn't

141
00:05:00,010 --> 00:05:03,909
quite feel right although the bad guy

142
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:07,599
might have your username they might have

143
00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:09,550
your password in some cases 99.9% of the

144
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:11,200
cases in a little more than that we

145
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:13,060
actually still are able to block those

146
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:15,099
kind of attempts because we have such a

147
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:16,960
kind of breadth of knowledge and we see

148
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:17,470
various different things going on on the

149
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,729
Internet

150
00:05:17,470 --> 00:05:21,520
now what this presentation is about

151
00:05:18,730 --> 00:05:23,710
today is the point 1% it's talking about

152
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:25,960
what can we do to actually try and

153
00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:27,580
secure the 0.1% in this case because at

154
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:29,140
the scale at which we operate in the

155
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:30,880
scale at which some of you folks operate

156
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:32,919
that point 1 percent is still very

157
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:35,560
significant and normally the accounts

158
00:05:32,919 --> 00:05:37,870
that really matters a lot are in that

159
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:40,270
point 1 percent right think reporters

160
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:41,590
politicians like c-level execs at

161
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:43,180
companies right that's normally the

162
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:45,940
folks that fit into that point 1 percent

163
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:47,740
so anyway in the the rest of the

164
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:49,479
presentation we are going to focus on

165
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:50,979
the things that can't be solved using

166
00:05:49,479 --> 00:05:53,979
kind of automatic measures right now

167
00:05:50,979 --> 00:05:55,659
what can you as a you know IT

168
00:05:53,979 --> 00:05:58,659
professional or you as an administrator

169
00:05:55,660 --> 00:06:02,440
or you as an individual do to try and

170
00:05:58,660 --> 00:06:04,030
curb this problem so sources of stolen

171
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:05,530
passwords we've already kind of spoken

172
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:07,210
about this a little bit phishing of

173
00:06:05,530 --> 00:06:08,710
course the number one threat out there

174
00:06:07,210 --> 00:06:09,640
and I'll back that up with some numbers

175
00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:11,109
here shortly

176
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:14,229
if you've seen the presentation

177
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:16,540
yesterday you'll so know that you know

178
00:06:14,229 --> 00:06:17,979
phishing is on the rise phishing is on

179
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:20,200
the up and up that's one of the you know

180
00:06:17,979 --> 00:06:22,240
lowest hanging fruits for bad guys right

181
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:25,450
now to get hold of active credentials

182
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:28,090
and also yesterday was shown that you

183
00:06:25,450 --> 00:06:29,979
know if someone actually gets hold of a

184
00:06:28,090 --> 00:06:33,280
username and password pair via phishing

185
00:06:29,979 --> 00:06:35,320
your account is 463 times more likely

186
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:37,210
than the average account to get hijacked

187
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:38,110
so a lot of interesting

188
00:06:37,210 --> 00:06:40,060
statistics if you didn't see that

189
00:06:38,110 --> 00:06:41,710
presentation please go online and look

190
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:43,750
at it later I think it's also available

191
00:06:41,710 --> 00:06:45,818
at Ellie's website but a lot more

192
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:47,889
details about why phishing is a problem

193
00:06:45,819 --> 00:06:49,780
over there he'll just do a very quick

194
00:06:47,889 --> 00:06:52,300
recap since we have some other stuff to

195
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:54,250
get you keylogger is another issue right

196
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:55,870
keyloggers actually not you know the

197
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:57,310
most important thing any longer and

198
00:06:55,870 --> 00:06:57,819
we'll look at that in in a second year

199
00:06:57,310 --> 00:06:59,380
as well

200
00:06:57,819 --> 00:07:00,849
I like the typical malware keyloggers

201
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:01,990
something running on your machine where

202
00:07:00,849 --> 00:07:03,669
you're typing keystrokes

203
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:05,740
someone's exfiltrating it's still a

204
00:07:03,669 --> 00:07:06,789
problem but you know I think in the

205
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:08,110
grand scheme of things phishing is

206
00:07:06,789 --> 00:07:10,000
really the thing to worry about

207
00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:12,009
and then lastly data breaches right we

208
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,199
looked at the statistics earlier 4.3

209
00:07:12,009 --> 00:07:15,759
billion user name/password pairs seems

210
00:07:14,199 --> 00:07:18,490
like every you know week there is one

211
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:20,169
that's really the big three sources of

212
00:07:18,490 --> 00:07:23,169
stolen passwords of stolen credentials

213
00:07:20,169 --> 00:07:24,758
right now you know where did these

214
00:07:23,169 --> 00:07:27,639
credentials come from right password

215
00:07:24,759 --> 00:07:29,560
reuse the single larger source right we

216
00:07:27,639 --> 00:07:31,990
keep reusing our passwords from service

217
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:33,550
to service as we said yesterday and I'll

218
00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:36,009
say it again today phishing the most

219
00:07:33,550 --> 00:07:37,599
dangerous source first victims I are at

220
00:07:36,009 --> 00:07:39,310
the highest risk to get accounts

221
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:41,590
compromised because it's kind of more of

222
00:07:39,310 --> 00:07:43,150
a targeted thing and then lastly the

223
00:07:41,590 --> 00:07:45,130
black market feels account compromised

224
00:07:43,150 --> 00:07:47,530
right there is a whole ecosystem that

225
00:07:45,130 --> 00:07:49,509
makes brokering these stolen credentials

226
00:07:47,530 --> 00:07:51,880
really really easy and really lucrative

227
00:07:49,509 --> 00:07:55,719
and that's really what's kind of feeling

228
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:57,639
this this whole this whole system so a

229
00:07:55,719 --> 00:07:59,349
couple of statistics before we really

230
00:07:57,639 --> 00:08:01,479
get to the meat here 91 percent of

231
00:07:59,349 --> 00:08:03,280
information security attacks start with

232
00:08:01,479 --> 00:08:05,530
phishing and 80 percent of attacks on

233
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:07,559
businesses include fishing in one way

234
00:08:05,530 --> 00:08:09,758
shape or form and there are some

235
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:11,800
sightings down there if you want to

236
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:14,050
check out the resources for for these

237
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:15,430
quotes you know I'm kind of like saying

238
00:08:14,050 --> 00:08:17,199
the same thing over and over here again

239
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:18,759
like phishing really big problem one

240
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:21,370
loss while you're to kind of just back

241
00:08:18,759 --> 00:08:22,900
this up with we looked at some Google

242
00:08:21,370 --> 00:08:25,240
Safe Browsing data right Google Safe

243
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:26,679
Browsing you can log into that right now

244
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:28,960
and you can kind of draw the same graphs

245
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:31,780
is all open but for the first time in

246
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:34,478
2016 phishing actually started

247
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:36,909
overtaking exploit based malware because

248
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:38,560
it is really so easy it is trivial it's

249
00:08:36,909 --> 00:08:40,149
much easier than having malware that

250
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:42,279
runs on different systems phishing is

251
00:08:40,149 --> 00:08:43,779
something it still works we'll see one

252
00:08:42,279 --> 00:08:45,220
more slide if I'm correct about this in

253
00:08:43,779 --> 00:08:47,230
a second year a study that Google has

254
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:49,720
done that kind of further backs this up

255
00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:51,040
so this is the one here 43% there on the

256
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:53,800
Left 43%

257
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:55,990
about one in two persons a google study

258
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:59,439
is found still false for fishing today

259
00:08:55,990 --> 00:09:02,139
if you can create a website that looks

260
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:05,410
pretty legitimate and you can get a user

261
00:09:02,139 --> 00:09:08,139
to I guess just see some kind of a link

262
00:09:05,410 --> 00:09:09,399
to that website if the message and I

263
00:09:08,139 --> 00:09:11,829
want to say if the the message doesn't

264
00:09:09,399 --> 00:09:13,449
even have to be I guess you know super

265
00:09:11,829 --> 00:09:16,149
legitimate as some other folks are found

266
00:09:13,449 --> 00:09:18,189
here if there is some urgency in there

267
00:09:16,149 --> 00:09:20,620
if user get sent this link and they

268
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:22,300
click on it about half of folks wanting

269
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:23,920
to people will still flow for that scam

270
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:26,139
and actually submit their credentials to

271
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:27,969
this phishing website and then one last

272
00:09:26,139 --> 00:09:29,350
word here a 76% of account

273
00:09:27,970 --> 00:09:30,970
vulnerabilities were due to weak or

274
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:32,230
stolen passwords and that's in the

275
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:33,550
Verizon data breach report that's a

276
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:35,529
little bit dated now but I think the

277
00:09:33,550 --> 00:09:37,479
latest one we have actually have this up

278
00:09:35,529 --> 00:09:40,509
by five percentage points to 81 percent

279
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:41,529
so anyway a lot of stuff I wanted to

280
00:09:40,509 --> 00:09:43,569
cover that as quickly as possible

281
00:09:41,529 --> 00:09:45,430
because really all it is is background

282
00:09:43,569 --> 00:09:47,229
and I'm sure most of you folks if not

283
00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:49,750
all of you already kind of knows this

284
00:09:47,230 --> 00:09:52,120
either intuitively or you've seen the

285
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:54,519
statistics before so the industry is not

286
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:56,050
sits tall right we've we've tried to do

287
00:09:54,519 --> 00:09:57,819
something to address this problem and

288
00:09:56,050 --> 00:09:59,769
the thing we've done is we came up with

289
00:09:57,819 --> 00:10:01,599
multi-factor authentication MFA or

290
00:09:59,769 --> 00:10:03,970
2-step verification or whatever you want

291
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:05,410
to call it but the fact is passwords on

292
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:07,269
its own is not enough anymore we need

293
00:10:05,410 --> 00:10:09,639
something more we need something else to

294
00:10:07,269 --> 00:10:11,230
try and you know make sure that the user

295
00:10:09,639 --> 00:10:13,230
is really the right person that's trying

296
00:10:11,230 --> 00:10:16,389
to login or gain access to a service

297
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:18,940
yours kind of a variation of this what

298
00:10:16,389 --> 00:10:20,290
was shown yesterday different forms of

299
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:23,680
multi-factor authentication have

300
00:10:20,290 --> 00:10:25,180
different ways of different levels of

301
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:27,239
assurance different ways to authenticate

302
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:30,430
the user at different strength levels

303
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:32,500
you know SMS voice still out there lot

304
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:34,000
of services use it you know we've seen

305
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:35,560
various things from NIST and other

306
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,750
places saying that like has amazes

307
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:40,449
deprecated or whatever cases or other

308
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:41,920
the reality is using any form of

309
00:10:40,449 --> 00:10:43,149
multi-factor authentication is still

310
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:45,880
better than using none

311
00:10:43,149 --> 00:10:47,949
so certainly SMS and voice up there as

312
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:49,930
one of the things that you can do to try

313
00:10:47,949 --> 00:10:51,250
and protect against password reuse for

314
00:10:49,930 --> 00:10:52,839
example right if you use the same

315
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:54,220
password across five services but you

316
00:10:52,839 --> 00:10:55,930
have multi-factor authentication setup

317
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:58,839
on all of them suddenly that

318
00:10:55,930 --> 00:11:00,399
reused password becomes you know useless

319
00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:02,290
to an attacker because at least there is

320
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:04,240
another factor of authentication yes

321
00:11:02,290 --> 00:11:04,810
there's issues with SMS there's issues

322
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:07,390
with voice

323
00:11:04,810 --> 00:11:09,130
telephone calls but but it's still a

324
00:11:07,390 --> 00:11:10,930
level of protection that's better than

325
00:11:09,130 --> 00:11:14,890
having absolutely nothing in place of

326
00:11:10,930 --> 00:11:16,560
course there's OTP generators totp H OTP

327
00:11:14,890 --> 00:11:19,779
various different standards out there

328
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:21,040
lately mobile push authentication you

329
00:11:19,779 --> 00:11:23,080
get a message on your phone when you're

330
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:24,370
trying to do an action saying hey is it

331
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:25,810
really you do you want to perform this

332
00:11:24,370 --> 00:11:28,630
action click on this prompt on your

333
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:30,219
phone that's great usability also

334
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:32,589
enhanced makes things a lot easier for

335
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:33,970
the user they can verify on the device

336
00:11:32,589 --> 00:11:36,250
that it really is the action they want

337
00:11:33,970 --> 00:11:38,260
to perform but the problem with all of

338
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:39,760
these technologies really are they're

339
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:41,350
what we call kind of reliable by the

340
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:43,930
attacker right so if you think about a

341
00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:45,790
bad guy setting up some phishing website

342
00:11:43,930 --> 00:11:47,349
somewhere on the Internet if that bad

343
00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:49,209
guy can get you to go to the phishing

344
00:11:47,350 --> 00:11:51,010
website and the bad guy can get you to

345
00:11:49,210 --> 00:11:52,990
enter your credentials in there and the

346
00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:54,580
bad guy then in real time tribes that

347
00:11:52,990 --> 00:11:56,710
credentials against the real service

348
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:58,330
you're gonna get your OTP you're gonna

349
00:11:56,710 --> 00:11:59,800
get prompted for your OTP you're gonna

350
00:11:58,330 --> 00:12:01,930
get your mobile push message on your

351
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:03,910
phone thinking it's you trying to login

352
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:05,560
and in essence you're gonna approve that

353
00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:06,850
login on your phone or type in your OTP

354
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:09,609
and all you're gonna do is you're gonna

355
00:12:06,850 --> 00:12:13,000
log the bad guy yet so in essence you're

356
00:12:09,610 --> 00:12:15,870
all of these factors are related

357
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:18,430
something that we had to stop so in 2012

358
00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:19,900
we got together with the bunch of folks

359
00:12:18,430 --> 00:12:23,079
in the industry and we came up with

360
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:25,990
something called Fido u2f which some of

361
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:27,760
you are aware Fido you to have the u2f

362
00:12:25,990 --> 00:12:29,530
stands for universal second factor is

363
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:30,880
kind of a precursor to web

364
00:12:29,530 --> 00:12:33,430
authentication which we're going to talk

365
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:36,580
about and the idea was to come up with a

366
00:12:33,430 --> 00:12:39,099
protocol that actually helps us to

367
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:40,690
defeat phishing right so the protocol

368
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:42,250
and we'll look at that in a second gear

369
00:12:40,690 --> 00:12:44,740
is how it defeats phishing it's actually

370
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:46,180
very very very simple but we had to come

371
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:48,310
up with a protocol that stops this

372
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:49,689
factor from being reliable and that's

373
00:12:48,310 --> 00:12:51,969
ultimately what we're trying to come up

374
00:12:49,690 --> 00:12:53,650
with and what the the whole web

375
00:12:51,970 --> 00:12:56,830
authentication kind of underpins is this

376
00:12:53,650 --> 00:12:58,030
mechanism of trying to defeat phishing

377
00:12:56,830 --> 00:13:00,940
that that was kind of one of the key

378
00:12:58,030 --> 00:13:02,770
premises here yes it ended up being a

379
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:05,320
physical security key in the first

380
00:13:02,770 --> 00:13:06,910
rendition of the protocol because it's

381
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:09,190
you know just something that's a little

382
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:10,630
bit easier to do getting you know specs

383
00:13:09,190 --> 00:13:12,459
out there and getting folks to build a

384
00:13:10,630 --> 00:13:14,290
little tiny consumer you know hardware

385
00:13:12,459 --> 00:13:15,760
device was a little easier to do than

386
00:13:14,290 --> 00:13:17,610
trying to get this protocol into all

387
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:19,800
different device types but

388
00:13:17,610 --> 00:13:20,910
nothing really stops this protocol from

389
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:23,040
being successful

390
00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:25,319
even if implemented directly in a mobile

391
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:28,050
phone for example so security keys is

392
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:30,029
one way to get this problem and get the

393
00:13:28,050 --> 00:13:31,890
solution to this problem out there but

394
00:13:30,029 --> 00:13:33,630
it's just one of the various avenues and

395
00:13:31,890 --> 00:13:35,959
later in this in this deck we'll will

396
00:13:33,630 --> 00:13:39,540
talk a little bit more about that tube

397
00:13:35,959 --> 00:13:40,949
so obligatory kind of marketing slut

398
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:42,449
we'll skip over this I'll just say there

399
00:13:40,950 --> 00:13:44,370
are security keys out there as I've said

400
00:13:42,450 --> 00:13:46,050
there are many different vendors who

401
00:13:44,370 --> 00:13:48,870
make fantastic security keys some you're

402
00:13:46,050 --> 00:13:50,490
at the event some not any security key

403
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:53,370
that that kind of you know follows the

404
00:13:50,490 --> 00:13:56,279
phyto standard u2f Fido to which we'll

405
00:13:53,370 --> 00:13:58,320
talk about in a second here is set out

406
00:13:56,279 --> 00:14:00,240
or set up just solve the phishing

407
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:01,589
problem and they all work against Google

408
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:04,170
services they all work against many

409
00:14:01,589 --> 00:14:06,060
other services online so if you feel

410
00:14:04,170 --> 00:14:08,209
you're at risk which I think most of you

411
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:11,189
here probably at some level or another

412
00:14:08,209 --> 00:14:13,890
might be it might be a good idea to

413
00:14:11,190 --> 00:14:16,050
investigate setting up a phishing

414
00:14:13,890 --> 00:14:19,160
resistant second factor for your account

415
00:14:16,050 --> 00:14:21,300
and using some form of a security key

416
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:22,800
something else as I've said that we've

417
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:25,050
launched it a little earlier this here

418
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:26,459
we said well it's really great to have

419
00:14:25,050 --> 00:14:29,550
to carry around the physical security

420
00:14:26,459 --> 00:14:31,260
key and by the way after the Tokyo feel

421
00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:33,630
free to come up to me or in the the rap

422
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:34,709
room I have some security keys available

423
00:14:33,630 --> 00:14:35,970
that I can give out if you don't have

424
00:14:34,709 --> 00:14:38,518
one already and you want to try it out

425
00:14:35,970 --> 00:14:41,519
but instead of using your physical

426
00:14:38,519 --> 00:14:43,050
security key to sign in you can also use

427
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:44,910
your phone basically what we've done is

428
00:14:43,050 --> 00:14:47,279
we said well this protocol can also be

429
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:49,649
implemented in computer to phone

430
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:51,959
communication unfortunately for the

431
00:14:49,649 --> 00:14:54,029
thing to be phishing resistant there has

432
00:14:51,959 --> 00:14:55,649
to be a local communication channel

433
00:14:54,029 --> 00:14:57,660
that's the crux and we'll look at that

434
00:14:55,649 --> 00:14:59,339
in a second but you have to have local

435
00:14:57,660 --> 00:15:01,019
communication between the device you're

436
00:14:59,339 --> 00:15:03,329
logging in from and your authentication

437
00:15:01,019 --> 00:15:05,100
factor if you think about it none of the

438
00:15:03,329 --> 00:15:07,380
other multi-factor authentication

439
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:09,209
options had that right they were all

440
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:11,010
based on relying something through the

441
00:15:09,209 --> 00:15:12,930
cloud through the internet somehow right

442
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:14,640
so what we're doing here is we're saying

443
00:15:12,930 --> 00:15:17,279
this physical connectivity that's really

444
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:19,529
how we stop the phishing so USB security

445
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:21,839
key clearly you plug it into a USB port

446
00:15:19,529 --> 00:15:23,339
the other option here of using your

447
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:24,570
phone looks a lot like push

448
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:26,279
authentication but it really isn't

449
00:15:24,570 --> 00:15:29,190
because there's a local communication

450
00:15:26,279 --> 00:15:31,320
channel between your browser and your

451
00:15:29,190 --> 00:15:34,440
mobile phone and in this case using blue

452
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:35,880
or using a kind of application level

453
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:37,649
pairing protocol built on top of

454
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:39,600
Bluetooth which also working on in the

455
00:15:37,649 --> 00:15:41,579
phyto Alliance and web authentication

456
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:44,160
but point here is we're kind of slowly

457
00:15:41,579 --> 00:15:46,019
starting to make progress on moving from

458
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:47,730
using physical security keys which by

459
00:15:46,019 --> 00:15:50,100
the way is still very important it still

460
00:15:47,730 --> 00:15:52,110
is a form factor of choice for many

461
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:54,060
users and enterprises but we're moving

462
00:15:52,110 --> 00:15:56,430
into the place where this technology can

463
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:58,500
become a reality for general consumers

464
00:15:56,430 --> 00:16:00,810
out there who clearly is never gonna

465
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:02,819
invest time and money in you know buying

466
00:16:00,810 --> 00:16:04,829
physical devices or at least from from

467
00:16:02,819 --> 00:16:07,110
our perspective so how does the Curie

468
00:16:04,829 --> 00:16:09,750
Keys work let's briefly look at this so

469
00:16:07,110 --> 00:16:11,550
in step number one after I've typed in

470
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:13,470
my username my password into some kind

471
00:16:11,550 --> 00:16:15,349
of a service there is a cryptographic

472
00:16:13,470 --> 00:16:17,610
challenge that gets sent from the server

473
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:19,860
to my device on which I'm trying to

474
00:16:17,610 --> 00:16:22,199
login at that point in time we're

475
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:25,110
actually sending a request from the

476
00:16:22,199 --> 00:16:27,029
browser through and the browser actually

477
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:29,399
looks at the URL it looks at the web

478
00:16:27,029 --> 00:16:30,569
origin where I'm trying to sign in so at

479
00:16:29,399 --> 00:16:33,360
this point I'm trying to sign in to

480
00:16:30,569 --> 00:16:36,479
google.com that has actually sent over a

481
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:38,760
local USB Channel or NFC or Bluetooth it

482
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:40,800
needs to be local to this particular

483
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:42,600
security key and we're also appending

484
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:44,880
the challenge that the server sent in

485
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:47,310
step number one what then happens if the

486
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:49,860
security key signs this challenge and

487
00:16:47,310 --> 00:16:51,660
the web origin so the the actual website

488
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:53,100
that the user is visiting so it

489
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:55,290
cryptographically signs it with a

490
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:57,120
private key that was established when I

491
00:16:55,290 --> 00:16:59,160
registered the security key the first

492
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:00,930
time right so security keys and Fido

493
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:03,029
works in a way that there's only two

494
00:17:00,930 --> 00:17:05,129
operations of note there is registration

495
00:17:03,029 --> 00:17:07,980
and there's sign right getting a

496
00:17:05,130 --> 00:17:09,449
signature so at t equals zero you set up

497
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:11,490
your security key with your account you

498
00:17:09,449 --> 00:17:13,260
plug it in it generates unique public

499
00:17:11,490 --> 00:17:15,329
private key key pair that's not on the

500
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:16,890
security key any other later point in

501
00:17:15,329 --> 00:17:18,448
time when you want to sign in you pull

502
00:17:16,890 --> 00:17:20,370
out your security key you plug it in and

503
00:17:18,449 --> 00:17:22,260
this is what happens the challenge gets

504
00:17:20,369 --> 00:17:23,790
sent from the server to your device we

505
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:25,709
send that all the way through the local

506
00:17:23,790 --> 00:17:27,178
channel to the key in addition to the

507
00:17:25,709 --> 00:17:28,710
challenge we're also signing the web

508
00:17:27,179 --> 00:17:31,169
origin so we're making sure you're

509
00:17:28,710 --> 00:17:32,909
visiting real Google comm and dot fake

510
00:17:31,169 --> 00:17:34,320
Google com that gets cryptographically

511
00:17:32,909 --> 00:17:36,210
signed with the private key that was

512
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:38,370
established we send all of this stuff

513
00:17:36,210 --> 00:17:40,320
back signed relay it from the device to

514
00:17:38,370 --> 00:17:42,570
the the client or user agent back to the

515
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:43,830
server and the server can validate that

516
00:17:42,570 --> 00:17:45,840
the user both

517
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:47,668
access to the correct private key right

518
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:49,199
because there's a signature and the

519
00:17:47,669 --> 00:17:51,779
server can validate that the user was

520
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:54,240
visiting the right website at this

521
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:56,460
particular point in time that's really

522
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:58,470
how we defeat phishing its crude in a

523
00:17:56,460 --> 00:18:00,210
extremely simple if you think about it

524
00:17:58,470 --> 00:18:01,679
it's just adding one additional piece of

525
00:18:00,210 --> 00:18:04,169
information but there are a certain

526
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:05,730
trusted ecosystems in this in this you

527
00:18:04,169 --> 00:18:08,010
know mechanism for example the browser

528
00:18:05,730 --> 00:18:10,769
is figuring out who's calling need to be

529
00:18:08,010 --> 00:18:12,210
trusted in this particular model but if

530
00:18:10,769 --> 00:18:13,529
you think about phishing and what's been

531
00:18:12,210 --> 00:18:14,789
happening and where malware kind of

532
00:18:13,529 --> 00:18:16,559
being on the decline and phishing being

533
00:18:14,789 --> 00:18:19,559
on the rise that is something that's not

534
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:21,690
totally unreasonable to assume in in the

535
00:18:19,559 --> 00:18:23,879
current ecosystem that we're in so this

536
00:18:21,690 --> 00:18:25,679
in a nutshell is how Fido and web

537
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:27,029
authentication works now for the rest of

538
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:28,289
the presentation we'll also look at

539
00:18:27,029 --> 00:18:30,899
things where we're not talking about

540
00:18:28,289 --> 00:18:33,269
security keys particularly but the same

541
00:18:30,899 --> 00:18:34,979
model always holds this is the

542
00:18:33,269 --> 00:18:36,809
authentication model for fighter there

543
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:38,429
is always a challenge there is always a

544
00:18:36,809 --> 00:18:40,110
challenge and the web origin that gets

545
00:18:38,429 --> 00:18:41,460
signed and everything then gets relayed

546
00:18:40,110 --> 00:18:43,709
back to the server in a way to

547
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:45,210
authenticate and make sure everything

548
00:18:43,710 --> 00:18:47,340
kind of is intact the user is access to

549
00:18:45,210 --> 00:18:50,580
the right private key and that the

550
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:52,350
correct web origin was being used so if

551
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:53,760
I do is created and the the whole

552
00:18:52,350 --> 00:18:55,500
solution here is created using open

553
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:57,389
standards I've used two terms

554
00:18:55,500 --> 00:19:01,769
interchangeably here this morning we're

555
00:18:57,389 --> 00:19:03,689
both an from the w3c and maybe Fido CTF

556
00:19:01,769 --> 00:19:05,130
API so essentially think about it this

557
00:19:03,690 --> 00:19:06,360
way there's two standards bodies that

558
00:19:05,130 --> 00:19:08,970
we're working in to standardize this

559
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:10,860
technology if you are a server like if

560
00:19:08,970 --> 00:19:12,299
you have a web service and you want to

561
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:13,918
implement any of this stuff you're

562
00:19:12,299 --> 00:19:16,590
interested in the web as an API the

563
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:18,120
thing from the w3c there is a separate

564
00:19:16,590 --> 00:19:20,519
API that's being standardized in the

565
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:23,070
Fido alliance and that really is the API

566
00:19:20,519 --> 00:19:25,830
that talks more about how security Keys

567
00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:29,100
interact with physical like devices

568
00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:31,080
browsers platforms that's more you know

569
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:32,820
of interest if you are a device offender

570
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:35,100
so that's kind of the the bottom part

571
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:36,178
over there so most folks here I think

572
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:38,250
would be more interested in the web

573
00:19:36,179 --> 00:19:40,200
ascend API which we'll talk about but

574
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:41,850
lastly if you're curious you can of

575
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:44,279
course also go look at the published

576
00:19:41,850 --> 00:19:46,289
standards see tap stands for a client to

577
00:19:44,279 --> 00:19:48,450
authenticate or protocol so it's a way

578
00:19:46,289 --> 00:19:51,629
in which these devices kind of framed

579
00:19:48,450 --> 00:19:54,240
bits on the wire or in the air so let's

580
00:19:51,630 --> 00:19:55,830
talk about web authentication I gave a

581
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:57,330
lot of background earlier like how these

582
00:19:55,830 --> 00:19:59,070
things hang together but I

583
00:19:57,330 --> 00:20:01,320
think it's very important to then also

584
00:19:59,070 --> 00:20:06,750
talk about the various use cases that

585
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:08,520
web authentication enables so the as I

586
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:10,440
said w3c have the specification called

587
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:12,629
web then that allows a websites to

588
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:14,340
interact with authenticators and again

589
00:20:12,630 --> 00:20:15,990
this is a different way of stating what

590
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:18,270
I've just said earlier there is a remote

591
00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:20,610
website there is webOS then there is a

592
00:20:18,270 --> 00:20:22,650
client there's C tapped to talk to

593
00:20:20,610 --> 00:20:27,840
removable things and then there is also

594
00:20:22,650 --> 00:20:31,290
a unspecified API for devices to talk

595
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:33,000
right down to both in biometrics and

596
00:20:31,290 --> 00:20:34,440
built-in authentication technologies and

597
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:37,650
devices one thing that we've announced

598
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:39,780
earlier this year was saying that hey

599
00:20:37,650 --> 00:20:41,520
Android devices seven-plus now have a

600
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:43,080
built-in fighter or webOS an

601
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:45,540
Authenticator what does that really mean

602
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:47,429
well that means we now have the client

603
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:49,020
which is Android connected up with the

604
00:20:47,430 --> 00:20:52,560
fingerprint sensor so you can actually

605
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:54,540
access directly from the web or from any

606
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:56,190
other Android application you can get

607
00:20:54,540 --> 00:20:58,110
hold of and sync think about it like a

608
00:20:56,190 --> 00:21:00,360
security key built right into the device

609
00:20:58,110 --> 00:21:02,370
itself or CENTAC ated with biometrics

610
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:04,050
and in the next slide or two we'll talk

611
00:21:02,370 --> 00:21:05,939
about what that actually enables what

612
00:21:04,050 --> 00:21:07,770
you as a developer can do with that

613
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:10,500
technology once it's all enabled because

614
00:21:07,770 --> 00:21:13,260
it's not always used as a second factor

615
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:14,970
which which is important so now we get

616
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:16,920
to the crux you write there's two use

617
00:21:14,970 --> 00:21:18,690
cases two primary use cases that

618
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:20,130
weibull's and fire fundamentally enables

619
00:21:18,690 --> 00:21:22,170
up until this point in the presentation

620
00:21:20,130 --> 00:21:23,910
I've only spoken about number one I

621
00:21:22,170 --> 00:21:26,040
spoken about bootstrapping right that's

622
00:21:23,910 --> 00:21:27,390
when I sign into a device the very first

623
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:29,490
time I type my username I type my

624
00:21:27,390 --> 00:21:31,620
password I grab my physical security key

625
00:21:29,490 --> 00:21:33,510
I plug it in and I use it as a second

626
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:35,340
factor has one more factor to make sure

627
00:21:33,510 --> 00:21:37,470
it's really me and I'm not visiting a

628
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:39,510
phishing website however we're both n

629
00:21:37,470 --> 00:21:41,490
also enables a second use case a little

630
00:21:39,510 --> 00:21:43,950
bit more nish but still important use

631
00:21:41,490 --> 00:21:46,260
case and that's the rivera fication or

632
00:21:43,950 --> 00:21:47,730
the real integration use case most of

633
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:50,700
you have dealt with that in your life

634
00:21:47,730 --> 00:21:51,990
before if you have an iPhone from 5s or

635
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:54,480
if you have an Android device and you

636
00:21:51,990 --> 00:21:56,400
visit like a banking service or you know

637
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:58,110
specifically open their app on your

638
00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:01,050
phone you know that the app sometimes

639
00:21:58,110 --> 00:22:03,120
offer to actually use biometrics instead

640
00:22:01,050 --> 00:22:05,040
of password to really indicate you when

641
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:06,870
you come back to the application you

642
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:08,550
still have to set up the application the

643
00:22:06,870 --> 00:22:10,850
very first time using your traditional

644
00:22:08,550 --> 00:22:12,950
factors but from then on out you can

645
00:22:10,850 --> 00:22:15,379
use biometrics or a screen lock or

646
00:22:12,950 --> 00:22:16,820
something to kind of show continued

647
00:22:15,380 --> 00:22:19,820
authentication or continued authenticity

648
00:22:16,820 --> 00:22:21,500
to this application here what we do is

649
00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:23,750
we actually look at at web

650
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:26,180
authentication for that and we're saying

651
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:27,680
that finally now we have api's available

652
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:29,390
from the web that allows you to get

653
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:32,150
access to all of the built-in

654
00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:33,890
authentication technology on the device

655
00:22:32,150 --> 00:22:35,840
not only from apps but also get access

656
00:22:33,890 --> 00:22:37,910
to built-in factors directly from the

657
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:39,949
web that's kind of how it looks like

658
00:22:37,910 --> 00:22:41,120
from the web you can go via Chrome you

659
00:22:39,950 --> 00:22:43,100
can outtalk the phyto module

660
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:45,260
applications always had direct access to

661
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:46,639
biometrics in the keystore but now for

662
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:48,590
the first time you can also get access

663
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:51,470
to this directly from the web

664
00:22:48,590 --> 00:22:53,540
application so that's kind of like the

665
00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:56,570
the mental model of what this bolting

666
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:58,580
Authenticator on Android looks like want

667
00:22:56,570 --> 00:23:01,550
to talk about to user journeys just

668
00:22:58,580 --> 00:23:03,439
briefly here meet Eliza Eliza wants to

669
00:23:01,550 --> 00:23:05,030
sign into her bank she starts on a

670
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:07,220
mobile browser and then wants to enroll

671
00:23:05,030 --> 00:23:08,930
a fingerprint after signing this is the

672
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:10,490
model that we all know and love when we

673
00:23:08,930 --> 00:23:12,950
go to a banking application on our

674
00:23:10,490 --> 00:23:15,230
Android phone or iPhone and we set it up

675
00:23:12,950 --> 00:23:17,150
the first time to use biometrics now we

676
00:23:15,230 --> 00:23:19,190
can do this directly from the web she

677
00:23:17,150 --> 00:23:22,520
tries to sign-in hits the sign-in button

678
00:23:19,190 --> 00:23:24,710
username password it offers to use

679
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:27,020
biometric authentication next time that

680
00:23:24,710 --> 00:23:30,290
she wants to use this particular web

681
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:31,430
application what we've done in the

682
00:23:30,290 --> 00:23:33,020
background here and all these slides

683
00:23:31,430 --> 00:23:35,030
will be available so you can go through

684
00:23:33,020 --> 00:23:36,620
this in in much more detail it's very

685
00:23:35,030 --> 00:23:37,879
simple there is a way to figure out

686
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:39,709
whether the platform that you're on

687
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:42,230
supports built-in web authentication

688
00:23:39,710 --> 00:23:43,670
it's this very very long ease user

689
00:23:42,230 --> 00:23:45,290
verifying platform Authenticator

690
00:23:43,670 --> 00:23:47,180
available call that you make so you'd

691
00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:47,480
know as a service whether this is built

692
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:49,370
in

693
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:50,960
if it is built in then you create a

694
00:23:49,370 --> 00:23:52,459
public key that's as simple as that

695
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:54,290
this platform then creates a public

696
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:56,000
private key keeper you send the public

697
00:23:54,290 --> 00:23:58,159
key to the server and store it and now

698
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:00,590
you have a keeper created built into the

699
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:01,970
phone so there is a bunch of different

700
00:24:00,590 --> 00:24:02,929
options I'm not going to talk about it

701
00:24:01,970 --> 00:24:04,550
you're too much we're running out of

702
00:24:02,930 --> 00:24:06,470
time I'll just say that two things are

703
00:24:04,550 --> 00:24:07,430
important it's needs to be built in I

704
00:24:06,470 --> 00:24:09,080
don't want to talk to an external

705
00:24:07,430 --> 00:24:10,940
security key I want to use an internal

706
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:12,590
one the platform Authenticator and I

707
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:14,960
wanted to verify the user's identity

708
00:24:12,590 --> 00:24:17,000
which is what the user verification is

709
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:18,860
required say - it means I have to

710
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:20,060
actually touch my fingerprint on the

711
00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:22,758
sensor when I want to do authentication

712
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:24,859
next time now realize that comes back to

713
00:24:22,759 --> 00:24:26,989
she goes back to try bank.com chance to

714
00:24:24,859 --> 00:24:28,579
vlogging again well this time she ate

715
00:24:26,989 --> 00:24:29,749
signing and all she has to do is touch

716
00:24:28,579 --> 00:24:32,089
her fingerprint of the sensor again

717
00:24:29,749 --> 00:24:35,029
we've had these kind of user journeys

718
00:24:32,089 --> 00:24:36,979
for the last five years but only in apps

719
00:24:35,029 --> 00:24:39,320
now we're bringing it to the web which

720
00:24:36,979 --> 00:24:40,879
means not only is this now a possibility

721
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:42,708
on mobile devices but it's also a

722
00:24:40,879 --> 00:24:44,299
possibility on the desktop or laptops

723
00:24:42,709 --> 00:24:46,309
where we you know typically interact

724
00:24:44,299 --> 00:24:47,959
with services in a web-like fashion so

725
00:24:46,309 --> 00:24:51,139
we've kind of brought parity I guess

726
00:24:47,959 --> 00:24:53,509
between the the mobile and/or the native

727
00:24:51,139 --> 00:24:55,579
application and the the web application

728
00:24:53,509 --> 00:24:58,039
world pretty straightforward here and

729
00:24:55,579 --> 00:24:59,690
how did that work well we just do a get

730
00:24:58,039 --> 00:25:01,669
so the two calls that's important here

731
00:24:59,690 --> 00:25:03,829
is create you make keys and get to

732
00:25:01,669 --> 00:25:05,659
actually get signatures back and again

733
00:25:03,829 --> 00:25:07,219
you just basically put a send in a

734
00:25:05,659 --> 00:25:09,169
pointer and say hey you remember that

735
00:25:07,219 --> 00:25:11,509
credential I registered earlier I want

736
00:25:09,169 --> 00:25:12,769
to get a signature for that one you want

737
00:25:11,509 --> 00:25:15,079
to verify the user and it's a

738
00:25:12,769 --> 00:25:16,549
straightforward is that what you can

739
00:25:15,079 --> 00:25:18,198
also do here that's very interesting is

740
00:25:16,549 --> 00:25:20,749
you can kind of use the same keys that

741
00:25:18,199 --> 00:25:22,549
you've used over on the on the website

742
00:25:20,749 --> 00:25:24,109
you can also use in a native app if

743
00:25:22,549 --> 00:25:26,059
you're the same publisher that owns both

744
00:25:24,109 --> 00:25:27,829
the application and the website you can

745
00:25:26,059 --> 00:25:29,509
link things together so that it Eliza

746
00:25:27,829 --> 00:25:31,129
the next time she comes back and

747
00:25:29,509 --> 00:25:32,239
download the mobile app can simply touch

748
00:25:31,129 --> 00:25:34,099
your fingerprint and she doesn't

749
00:25:32,239 --> 00:25:35,839
actually have to go through all of the

750
00:25:34,099 --> 00:25:37,129
processes of reboots driving that

751
00:25:35,839 --> 00:25:39,319
application because the keys we've

752
00:25:37,129 --> 00:25:41,718
created in Fido land is shared between

753
00:25:39,319 --> 00:25:43,459
native app and web very very important

754
00:25:41,719 --> 00:25:44,839
what happens behind the scenes same

755
00:25:43,459 --> 00:25:46,940
thing as we said earlier pretty

756
00:25:44,839 --> 00:25:48,769
straightforward you really just do the

757
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:51,799
do the same kind of cool but in a native

758
00:25:48,769 --> 00:25:53,269
Fido fashion do case studies and then

759
00:25:51,799 --> 00:25:54,829
I'm all done I'll just show this briefly

760
00:25:53,269 --> 00:25:56,779
this has been implemented by Yahoo Japan

761
00:25:54,829 --> 00:25:57,948
they've seen a reduction in time you're

762
00:25:56,779 --> 00:25:59,899
about about thirty seven point five

763
00:25:57,949 --> 00:26:01,609
percent and then we've also implemented

764
00:25:59,899 --> 00:26:03,079
that and actually we're on the process

765
00:26:01,609 --> 00:26:05,418
literally this week of rolling this out

766
00:26:03,079 --> 00:26:08,389
to users where we've seen a huge

767
00:26:05,419 --> 00:26:10,369
reduction in both the CICC of the the

768
00:26:08,389 --> 00:26:12,738
failure rate of people not knowing their

769
00:26:10,369 --> 00:26:14,269
password as well as a reduction in the

770
00:26:12,739 --> 00:26:17,089
time spent in actually doing

771
00:26:14,269 --> 00:26:18,529
password-based authentication implement

772
00:26:17,089 --> 00:26:20,059
this did I follow me on Twitter for any

773
00:26:18,529 --> 00:26:21,900
updates and I will share the slides

774
00:26:20,059 --> 00:26:29,160
thank you folks

775
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:29,160
[Applause]
