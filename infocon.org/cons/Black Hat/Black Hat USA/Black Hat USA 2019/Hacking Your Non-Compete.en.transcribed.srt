00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:27,940
these up these are too good alright so

57
00:02:26,170 --> 00:02:29,260

58
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:31,120
salesperson in the world

59
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:33,070
this one actually happened recently so

60
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:36,760
company a is planning to fire the worst

61
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:38,980
salesperson in the world they find out

62
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:41,440
that he's the the salesperson find out

63
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:43,179
he's gonna be fired so he starts looking

64
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:46,060
for a job and he interviews with Company

65
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:47,980
B Company B hires him because they think

66
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:50,790
he's the best salesperson in the world

67
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:52,959
he's gonna be perfect for their company

68
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:56,769
company he finds out that he's going to

69
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:59,320
Company B and they're not happy so

70
00:02:56,770 --> 00:03:01,300
company a tries to enforce a non-compete

71
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:03,190
that they downloaded off the internet

72
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:05,740
you know cuz that's how you do real

73
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:12,120
legal work right Google knows it all and

74
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:14,590
a whole bunch of fun starts alright so

75
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:16,450
according to the non-compete the worst

76
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:18,450
sales person in the world is not allowed

77
00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:21,100
to work for anybody that company a

78
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:22,780
considers to be a competitor so anybody

79
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:24,549
in the cyber security space selling any

80
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:28,090
kind of endpoint solution for anything

81
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:30,700
ever you can't work for them they also

82
00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:32,830
claimed that the worst sales person in

83
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:35,170
the world had downloaded sensitive

84
00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:37,959
client data and provided it to Company B

85
00:03:35,170 --> 00:03:40,540
as a way to compete directly with them

86
00:03:37,959 --> 00:03:42,700
and steal their clients and so on

87
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:45,220
company a fortunately trying to do the

88
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:47,679
right thing they didn't provide any

89
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:49,209
computer equipment to the worst salesman

90
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:51,040
in the world so he was working at this

91
00:03:49,209 --> 00:03:55,000
company working off his personally owned

92
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:56,890
laptop the entire time he's there so of

93
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,140
course there's gonna be just a little

94
00:03:56,890 --> 00:04:03,549
bit of company data on his computer

95
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:05,768
things like this what about company be

96
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:07,180
alright Company B in this arrow they

97
00:04:05,769 --> 00:04:09,850
hire the best sales person in the world

98
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:12,430
right he's perfect for them to run their

99
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:13,810
as their sales team leads so he's not

100
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:17,108
working as a salesman he's working as a

101
00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:19,988
sales team lead for them provided the

102
00:04:17,108 --> 00:04:23,289
employment they actually prevented him

103
00:04:19,988 --> 00:04:24,849
from contacting any of company A's

104
00:04:23,289 --> 00:04:26,580
clients so that was in his original

105
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:28,020
agreement up front they're like

106
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:30,630
we don't want to get into a thing with

107
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:33,450
company a you can't you can't contacting

108
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:36,600
these folks they also gave him a brand

109
00:04:33,450 --> 00:04:38,880
new laptop and they went so far as to

110
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:42,330
say look we we don't we don't want you

111
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:45,030
to bring upload anything we want no no

112
00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:46,859
client files from you no data no no

113
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:49,229
contacts we're gonna do this all all

114
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:53,460
clean you're gonna start off as our new

115
00:04:49,230 --> 00:04:54,990
sales VP type person and here's where it

116
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:57,330
starts to go sideways company A's

117
00:04:54,990 --> 00:04:59,340
attorneys and company B's attorneys a

118
00:04:57,330 --> 00:05:01,440
letter stating that they can't employ

119
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:03,599
the worst sales person in the world and

120
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:10,229
demand that he'd return all the data

121
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:14,850
they stoled to them and then the fight

122
00:05:10,229 --> 00:05:17,280
starts so we've got first company a is

123
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:18,780
good bad and ugly and actually it

124
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:21,270
crossed out good because they didn't do

125
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:23,359
anything good I read everything was was

126
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:26,870
just a complete mess

127
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:29,580
first and foremost you as an employer

128
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:30,990
particularly of tech employees you need

129
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:33,120
to have policies that govern data

130
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:35,850
storage and handling and use of

131
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:38,070
employees own equipment and devices if

132
00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:40,530
you take the time to record it to have

133
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:43,530
written policies then you're informing

134
00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:45,659
your employer your employee of the fact

135
00:05:43,530 --> 00:05:48,359
that that they've got this obligation to

136
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:52,169
maintain information and confidence if

137
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:53,729
you're not taking that step of informing

138
00:05:52,169 --> 00:05:55,370
them that the certain of your

139
00:05:53,729 --> 00:05:57,630
information is confidential and that

140
00:05:55,370 --> 00:05:59,400
they've got an obligation to keep it as

141
00:05:57,630 --> 00:06:03,360
confidential you're lessening your

142
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:05,429
ability to go out and force your

143
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:07,110
proprietary rights in that confidential

144
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:08,880
information you want to make sure that

145
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:10,740
that information is locked up you have

146
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:14,280
it documented you've got policies to

147
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:16,919
protect it we talked about the fact that

148
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:18,599
the employee uses own computer the fact

149
00:06:16,919 --> 00:06:22,919
that he's using his own computer does

150
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:25,620
not make the data the employees right

151
00:06:22,919 --> 00:06:27,659
it's still the employers data despite

152
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:30,900
the fact that it resides on the

153
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:31,289
employers computer but the rest of the

154
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:33,388
data

155
00:06:31,289 --> 00:06:35,099
that's on the computer is still the

156
00:06:33,389 --> 00:06:37,740
employees so just the fact that he

157
00:06:35,099 --> 00:06:38,650
commingled his employers data with his

158
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:41,050
own data

159
00:06:38,650 --> 00:06:42,310
does not make the rest of the data

160
00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:45,699
that's on the computer of the computer

161
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:47,710
itself the property of the employer so

162
00:06:45,699 --> 00:06:51,100
think about the mess that that creates

163
00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:53,349
once you get into litigation right

164
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:55,979
during the discovery process now the

165
00:06:53,350 --> 00:07:00,070
other side that's going after and and

166
00:06:55,979 --> 00:07:01,780
deposing the employee has his computer

167
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:04,719
is going through a tooth and nail and

168
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:07,630
finding anything and everything that

169
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:09,610
might be personal to that employee so

170
00:07:07,630 --> 00:07:12,039
it's not a good idea for the employer

171
00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:13,960
it's not a good idea for the employee to

172
00:07:12,039 --> 00:07:16,330
be using your own equipment particularly

173
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:19,810
to store company confidential

174
00:07:16,330 --> 00:07:22,810
proprietary information we also

175
00:07:19,810 --> 00:07:25,060
mentioned that he had a non-compete

176
00:07:22,810 --> 00:07:27,220
agreement good idea to have a

177
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:30,160
non-compete agreement with employees

178
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:33,310
that are touching your proprietary and

179
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:36,669
confidential information but it has to

180
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:39,340
be an enforceable agreement in order to

181
00:07:36,669 --> 00:07:41,380
be enforceable non-competes have to be

182
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:44,500
reasonable they have to be reasonable in

183
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:45,940
scope and duration if they're not courts

184
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:49,060
are going to throw them out they're not

185
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:52,240
going to enforce the agreement as a

186
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:53,979
result form agreements are really really

187
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:56,910
really never a good idea

188
00:07:53,979 --> 00:07:58,870
different employees in different roles

189
00:07:56,910 --> 00:08:01,300
even different employees just at a

190
00:07:58,870 --> 00:08:03,490
single corporation are going to have

191
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:05,830
different circumstances somebody that's

192
00:08:03,490 --> 00:08:08,050
an hourly employee is going to have

193
00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:09,789
different responsibilities from a senior

194
00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:11,110
level executive and so there are

195
00:08:09,789 --> 00:08:14,409
obligations to keep information

196
00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:16,090
confidential are going to vary you can't

197
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:19,240
have a form document that possibly

198
00:08:16,090 --> 00:08:22,000
covers every possible situation moreover

199
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:24,270
as an employee as a tech employee you're

200
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,770
going to be best served by going in and

201
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:29,409
negotiating the terms of your

202
00:08:26,770 --> 00:08:31,479
non-compete you want clear definition of

203
00:08:29,410 --> 00:08:33,550
the meets and bounds of stuff that you

204
00:08:31,479 --> 00:08:35,919
have to keep confidential so that if you

205
00:08:33,549 --> 00:08:38,740
do move on to another employer you know

206
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:41,279
where you're boxed out so it's always a

207
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:43,299
horrible idea to use form agreements

208
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:45,910
enforceability and reasonableness can

209
00:08:43,299 --> 00:08:48,699
vary from state to state so literally an

210
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:50,980
agreement that is enforceable in let's

211
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:51,940
say Maryland where I'm from might not be

212
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:54,250
enforceable in cow

213
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:56,320
fornia which is one of the most employee

214
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:58,960
friendly jurisdictions in the United

215
00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:02,350
States so it's important to realize that

216
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:04,750
the agreements can have varying degrees

217
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:07,420
of enforce ability depending on one

218
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:10,150
where they're entered into and finally

219
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:11,890
you need to show as an employer you

220
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:14,770
would need to show an actual breach of

221
00:09:11,890 --> 00:09:17,050
that agreement so whether or not

222
00:09:14,770 --> 00:09:18,910
somebody breaches a non-compete depends

223
00:09:17,050 --> 00:09:21,280
on the specific language that is in the

224
00:09:18,910 --> 00:09:22,990
agreement that's again a good reason why

225
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:25,630
you want to negotiate the specific terms

226
00:09:22,990 --> 00:09:28,270
have really clear boundaries as to what

227
00:09:25,630 --> 00:09:30,520
is in and what is outside the scope of

228
00:09:28,270 --> 00:09:33,730
that agreement so that again you know

229
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:35,710
exactly where your box that from company

230
00:09:33,730 --> 00:09:37,990
B's perspective and the salespersons

231
00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:39,550
perspective first confidential

232
00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:41,950
proprietary and trade secret information

233
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:44,170
of company a is off-limits

234
00:09:41,950 --> 00:09:46,030
when you move from one this should

235
00:09:44,170 --> 00:09:48,099
generally go without saying but it

236
00:09:46,030 --> 00:09:51,760
happens all the time when you move from

237
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:53,530
employer a to employer B you cannot take

238
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:56,710
with you the company's confidential

239
00:09:53,530 --> 00:09:59,140
proprietary information if you do you're

240
00:09:56,710 --> 00:10:01,660
likely to get sued or at least

241
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:03,189
threatened with suit and imagine if you

242
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:05,770
just start an employee at the new

243
00:10:03,190 --> 00:10:08,110
employer and your new employer is

244
00:10:05,770 --> 00:10:10,660
getting a cease and desist letter from

245
00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:12,070
some nasty law firm saying you've got to

246
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:14,370
terminate this guy that you just hired

247
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:16,300
not a good idea

248
00:10:14,370 --> 00:10:18,640
sensitive client data is certainly

249
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:20,459
confidential information taking

250
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:22,449
sensitive client data without

251
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:24,430
authorization is absolutely

252
00:10:22,450 --> 00:10:26,290
misappropriation it's set you're

253
00:10:24,430 --> 00:10:28,660
stealing property from the from the

254
00:10:26,290 --> 00:10:32,500
former employer if it's trade secret

255
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:35,620
information which is super confidential

256
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:38,140
information right if you steal trade

257
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:39,520
secret information the company B and the

258
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:41,920
salesperson could be sued for an

259
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:44,319
injunction an injunction is basically

260
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:46,000
the court order that says that you must

261
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:49,390
do something or that you're not allowed

262
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:52,060
to do something and it the scope of that

263
00:10:49,390 --> 00:10:53,920
injunction could go so far as to not

264
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:56,020
only prevent use and further disclosures

265
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:58,300
of confidential information but a court

266
00:10:56,020 --> 00:11:00,220
could actually order the new employer to

267
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:05,349
terminate the employee to prevent

268
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:08,480
continued breach of the non-compete

269
00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:10,580
there's also potential liability on

270
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:12,680
company AIDS part 4 allowing the

271
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:14,780
employee in the first in the first place

272
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:16,640
to take the information if they didn't

273
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:18,829
take reasonable measures to lock up that

274
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:21,230
information and they've let their own

275
00:11:18,830 --> 00:11:24,310
clients information out of the bag they

276
00:11:21,230 --> 00:11:26,720
face liability to their own client base

277
00:11:24,310 --> 00:11:30,109
the finally obtaining an agreement with

278
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:31,910
the salesperson preventing solicitation

279
00:11:30,110 --> 00:11:34,310
of prior clients or using company a's

280
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:36,469
data is obviously a good idea you're

281
00:11:34,310 --> 00:11:38,750
taking in new tech employees you want to

282
00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:41,330
have clear policies that dictate your

283
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:42,410
you should not be using information that

284
00:11:41,330 --> 00:11:44,960
you've brought in from your former

285
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:46,880
employer that is confidential it's a

286
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:50,240
great idea to do that but it's not going

287
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:52,640
to be an absolute defense so you still

288
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:56,540
need to take proper measures to lock up

289
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:59,510
that information all right so I told you

290
00:11:56,540 --> 00:12:01,849
tell you how it all ended both companies

291
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:04,370
hired really expensive Washington DC law

292
00:12:01,850 --> 00:12:07,520
firms they traded a lot of angry paper

293
00:12:04,370 --> 00:12:09,920
back and forth and then the two ceos

294
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:11,060
thought a little bit better of it one of

295
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:12,560
them decided they didn't really care

296
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:14,569
that they lost the worst salesperson in

297
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:15,739
the world the other one had a lot more

298
00:12:14,570 --> 00:12:18,290
money and they didn't want to fight with

299
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:18,770
him and so it just kind of fell by the

300
00:12:18,290 --> 00:12:22,069
wayside

301
00:12:18,770 --> 00:12:23,360
the forensics of it is the file that

302
00:12:22,070 --> 00:12:25,460
they their files that he claimed they'd

303
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:27,020
taken we're actually three years old log

304
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:28,670
analysis and metadata on the files

305
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:30,230
showed they were three years old not

306
00:12:28,670 --> 00:12:31,339
related weren't recently downloaded

307
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:34,700
everything do with anything just

308
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:37,070
leftovers all right

309
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:39,050
this story is is too hard to make up

310
00:12:37,070 --> 00:12:41,510
this is the craziest thing ever so this

311
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:42,589
is how to do absolutely everything wrong

312
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:44,030
when you're planning to leave an

313
00:12:42,590 --> 00:12:46,690
employer and start your own competitive

314
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:48,920
company all right so we have a company

315
00:12:46,690 --> 00:12:50,840
blackbriar equipment they've been making

316
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:53,360
oil exploration equipment for about the

317
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:55,040
past 30 years they're kind of a pioneer

318
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:57,500
in their area they're one of the lead

319
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:59,540
companies of space they're newly

320
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:01,820
appointed general manager notices that

321
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:04,099
her sales for a quarter are off by about

322
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:05,960
three million dollars so they've been in

323
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:07,430
this space so long that they're just

324
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:09,080
used to win in a certain amount of

325
00:13:07,430 --> 00:13:11,300
business every quarter right we send out

326
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:13,280
a quote people would give us the

327
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:15,829
contract we just move on but now they're

328
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:17,270
off three million and a quarter Mitch

329
00:13:15,830 --> 00:13:17,820
thinks it might have something to do

330
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:20,699
with a men

331
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:24,410
her bid proposal team that was hired by

332
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:27,930
her predecessor under a cloud suspicious

333
00:13:24,410 --> 00:13:29,910
from a competing firm he had a history

334
00:13:27,930 --> 00:13:35,099
of some some interesting behavior at a

335
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:37,439
previous company so GM has us go ahead

336
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:39,150
and look into the computers and email

337
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:42,000
the entire sales team for the previous

338
00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:44,550
six months and we find that not one but

339
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,830
five members of her sales team have

340
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:49,280
decided to start their own competing

341
00:13:46,830 --> 00:13:51,300
company while working at blackbriar and

342
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:53,550
during the day they worked on the bids

343
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:56,069
and proposals for blackbriar and at

344
00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:58,199
night they under bid on their own

345
00:13:56,070 --> 00:14:01,500
company that they'd form called black

346
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:04,710
horse black horse consulting to be

347
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:06,240
specific so they were working on one

348
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:08,820
during the day working for themselves in

349
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:10,320
the evening they were also redirecting

350
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:12,750
incoming work because they were the

351
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:14,880
sales team so they were taking clients

352
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:17,100
that thought they were some sending

353
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:18,570
business to blackbriar and going yeah

354
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:22,200
this will just go to black horse

355
00:14:18,570 --> 00:14:23,730
consulting it all works right and and

356
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:25,970
also redirecting some of the invoices

357
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:30,090
and things like this good stuff

358
00:14:25,970 --> 00:14:33,540
so this one's pretty easy theft is not a

359
00:14:30,090 --> 00:14:36,900
great career development strategy what

360
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:39,630
they were doing was outright theft it's

361
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:41,189
no different than if they had stolen

362
00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:45,210
equipment or stolen cash from the

363
00:14:41,190 --> 00:14:47,340
company bid information that's all

364
00:14:45,210 --> 00:14:50,430
confidential proprietary information if

365
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:53,690
not trade secret information of

366
00:14:50,430 --> 00:14:57,180
blackbriar so that's all their property

367
00:14:53,690 --> 00:15:00,000
the double-timing employees for

368
00:14:57,180 --> 00:15:02,250
performing that fat theft not only face

369
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:06,570
liability for damages but they could go

370
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:10,170
to jail they breach their fiduciary duty

371
00:15:06,570 --> 00:15:11,880
to the yield to the company they

372
00:15:10,170 --> 00:15:13,860
breached presumably employee

373
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:16,320
confidentiality agreements assuming

374
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:18,540
blackbriar went to the trouble at the

375
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:21,680
outset of getting confidentiality

376
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:24,510
agreements with their employees and

377
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:26,640
obviously a good takeaway there it would

378
00:15:24,510 --> 00:15:29,490
have been good for blackbriar to have

379
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:31,410
implemented measures to protect against

380
00:15:29,490 --> 00:15:33,600
the unauthorized copying

381
00:15:31,410 --> 00:15:36,480
use of confidential information building

382
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:38,279
systems that create alerts to to

383
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:41,480
personnel if they're copying certain

384
00:15:38,279 --> 00:15:46,040
confidential information or if they're

385
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:49,769
just dump copying lots and lots of data

386
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:51,920
how to do it right tell the employer

387
00:15:49,769 --> 00:15:54,740
that you're that you're looking to leave

388
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:57,540
the overall honesty is the best policy

389
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:59,759
again don't take confidential or

390
00:15:57,540 --> 00:16:04,529
proprietary information because it is a

391
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:06,240
very real property of the employer it's

392
00:16:04,529 --> 00:16:08,370
a good idea to negotiate a well-defined

393
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:11,009
separation agreement that limits the

394
00:16:08,370 --> 00:16:12,389
scope of any non-compete so if you're

395
00:16:11,009 --> 00:16:16,230
having a separation you're talking about

396
00:16:12,389 --> 00:16:18,089
severance package oh that's that's if

397
00:16:16,230 --> 00:16:20,250
you haven't already signed a non-compete

398
00:16:18,089 --> 00:16:22,019
that's a time where it's usually going

399
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:25,079
to come up and it gives you lots of

400
00:16:22,019 --> 00:16:26,790
opportunity to negotiate a proper scope

401
00:16:25,079 --> 00:16:28,500
one of the most important things to do

402
00:16:26,790 --> 00:16:32,550
there and negotiating that scope is

403
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:37,230
defining what is and and is not though

404
00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:38,969
in that competitive blog right so you

405
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:41,430
want to make sure that's clearly defined

406
00:16:38,970 --> 00:16:42,870
so that you know you can go to work in

407
00:16:41,430 --> 00:16:45,449
this field go to work in that field

408
00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:48,300
maybe this employer is off limits for

409
00:16:45,449 --> 00:16:53,310
for 18 months but again it's critical to

410
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:55,439
define that that scope and then finally

411
00:16:53,310 --> 00:16:57,869
just beat him in the marketplace that's

412
00:16:55,439 --> 00:17:03,000
the way to win you better at at what

413
00:16:57,870 --> 00:17:05,280
you're doing than they are all right so

414
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:07,890
telling you how that one ends one how

415
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:08,309
many of you think they fired the guy hey

416
00:17:07,890 --> 00:17:12,959
buddy

417
00:17:08,309 --> 00:17:14,668
anyway didn't fire him did not fire him

418
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:17,039
three million dollars later didn't fire

419
00:17:14,669 --> 00:17:18,900
him yeah we we hauled him in and we

420
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:21,000
sweated him just like CSI turns out his

421
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:22,799
dad was a luminary in the industry and

422
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,990
we basically threatened to tell his

423
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:27,270
daddy on him that what he'd been doing

424
00:17:24,990 --> 00:17:29,340
and he rolled over on everybody else in

425
00:17:27,270 --> 00:17:32,340
the group gave up all the details gave

426
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:34,830
up all their chats and instant messaging

427
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:37,709
you name it and saved his own butt and

428
00:17:34,830 --> 00:17:40,110
the company kept him on that's not

429
00:17:37,710 --> 00:17:42,510
unusual we run into these scenarios all

430
00:17:40,110 --> 00:17:45,139
the time and people make what I think

431
00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:48,960
are poor business decisions we

432
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:52,140
but yeah so when all right give it away

433
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:53,820
your github here someone's ugly so

434
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:55,620
company's service off has an interesting

435
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:57,210
idea for an integrated minibar billing

436
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:59,120
tracking ordering and refill system

437
00:17:57,210 --> 00:18:02,790
cutting-edge perfect for a place like

438
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:04,800
Vegas right it was even supposed to be

439
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:07,379
little robots like help refill the stuff

440
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:09,090
and things like it's very cool problem

441
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:11,670
was after multiple attempts to make this

442
00:18:09,090 --> 00:18:13,889
work service off wasn't getting to a

443
00:18:11,670 --> 00:18:16,140
working software solution it just wasn't

444
00:18:13,890 --> 00:18:17,340
all integrating and coming together so

445
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:19,530
after some searching they find a

446
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:21,720
developer who has some an open source

447
00:18:19,530 --> 00:18:23,700
project that's similar to what they want

448
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:25,920
to build got a lot of good ideas in it

449
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:27,360
things like that and so the developer

450
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:29,190
agrees to work for service off and

451
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:30,719
assist them to integrate their hardware

452
00:18:29,190 --> 00:18:32,550
and software and get this this product

453
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:37,650
off the ground going sounds like a good

454
00:18:32,550 --> 00:18:38,940
deal right well after working there for

455
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:40,920
a little bit of service off the

456
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:42,330
developer figures out why there's

457
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:43,740
problems with the company it's a whole

458
00:18:42,330 --> 00:18:45,540
lot bigger than they can't get their

459
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:47,790
software to run right right there's some

460
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:49,139
management issues things like that so

461
00:18:47,790 --> 00:18:50,430
the developer decides I'm going to

462
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:52,500
terminate my employment with this place

463
00:18:50,430 --> 00:18:54,390
I got to get out of here and he goes

464
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:56,190
back to independent software consulting

465
00:18:54,390 --> 00:18:58,140
right came from there I'm just gonna go

466
00:18:56,190 --> 00:18:59,640
back to doing that a couple of months

467
00:18:58,140 --> 00:19:00,870
after he quits developer receives a

468
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:03,090
notice from service off that his

469
00:19:00,870 --> 00:19:05,189
open-source project on github is the

470
00:19:03,090 --> 00:19:06,330
property of service off and he has to

471
00:19:05,190 --> 00:19:12,020
take it down cease and desist

472
00:19:06,330 --> 00:19:12,020
immediately all your stuff is ours now

473
00:19:12,890 --> 00:19:21,480
okay so the key question here is given

474
00:19:17,070 --> 00:19:24,540
that separation who owns what from the

475
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:28,410
developers efforts at the at that

476
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:30,510
employer and the one of the key issues

477
00:19:28,410 --> 00:19:32,850
is is that person actually an employee

478
00:19:30,510 --> 00:19:35,760
or are they a contractor and that

479
00:19:32,850 --> 00:19:38,850
classification is critical when you're

480
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:41,820
defining ownership of intellectual

481
00:19:38,850 --> 00:19:44,370
property if the developers an employee

482
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:46,230
and if that employee is working within

483
00:19:44,370 --> 00:19:49,639
the scope of their employment during

484
00:19:46,230 --> 00:19:51,920
that development effort something is

485
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:55,320
likely the property of service off

486
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:58,230
question is then what for pre-existing

487
00:19:55,320 --> 00:20:00,689
IP that they brought into

488
00:19:58,230 --> 00:20:03,510
that developmental effort it's still

489
00:20:00,690 --> 00:20:05,130
going to be the developers IP unless

490
00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:06,780
there were some agreement at the outset

491
00:20:05,130 --> 00:20:09,299
between the employer and the employee

492
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:12,000
that said you're giving all that to us

493
00:20:09,299 --> 00:20:14,040
you're assigning that IP to us unless

494
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:17,360
there's such an agreement then the

495
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:20,159
developer still owns that background IP

496
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:23,580
for the IP that's developed at service

497
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:27,179
soft not including the part that's

498
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:29,520
carved out as the pre-existing IP that

499
00:20:27,179 --> 00:20:31,290
is owned by service all again assuming

500
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:34,770
it's stuff that they developed within

501
00:20:31,290 --> 00:20:37,320
the scope of their employment but it

502
00:20:34,770 --> 00:20:41,100
only restricts the developer from using

503
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:44,010
that new and finished product so absent

504
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:45,600
a non-compete with that employee the

505
00:20:44,010 --> 00:20:47,790
developer is still free to go out and

506
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:49,260
use their pre-existing IP to develop

507
00:20:47,790 --> 00:20:54,120
other products including competing

508
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:56,910
products now if the developer is a

509
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:58,979
contractor it's a little bit of a

510
00:20:56,910 --> 00:21:01,230
different scenario first if they're a

511
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:02,880
contractor then there is a contract

512
00:21:01,230 --> 00:21:04,169
typically that spells out the

513
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:07,049
relationship and the duties of the

514
00:21:04,169 --> 00:21:08,340
parties in that agreement typically you

515
00:21:07,049 --> 00:21:11,100
would see an intellectual property

516
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:13,168
ownership provision that spells out who

517
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:15,870
owns what in that final product that's

518
00:21:13,169 --> 00:21:18,150
developed so the developer really needs

519
00:21:15,870 --> 00:21:20,389
to make sure that that's that they're

520
00:21:18,150 --> 00:21:22,500
detailing and documenting any

521
00:21:20,390 --> 00:21:24,150
pre-existing IP that they have that

522
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:26,070
they're bringing into that effort and

523
00:21:24,150 --> 00:21:29,880
carve it out of anything that's being

524
00:21:26,070 --> 00:21:31,860
assigned to service off do you need to

525
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:33,600
expect a service office want to end the

526
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:36,510
the final project that is going to own

527
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:39,750
the final product but just not your

528
00:21:36,510 --> 00:21:41,730
pre-existing IP in both of those cases

529
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:44,549
the developer needs to be careful not to

530
00:21:41,730 --> 00:21:46,650
use or integrate service office

531
00:21:44,549 --> 00:21:49,860
confidential or trade secret information

532
00:21:46,650 --> 00:21:51,720
in any future work right so during their

533
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:53,549
development effort they're in all

534
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:55,559
likelihood finding out some confidential

535
00:21:53,549 --> 00:21:58,590
information of service off you need to

536
00:21:55,559 --> 00:22:01,428
make sure that that's put aside and

537
00:21:58,590 --> 00:22:03,990
carved out and not used in future effort

538
00:22:01,429 --> 00:22:06,030
a good way to do that is keeping a clear

539
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:08,250
trail of your developmental effort so

540
00:22:06,030 --> 00:22:10,470
that for instance just maintaining an

541
00:22:08,250 --> 00:22:11,890
engineering notebook so that you can

542
00:22:10,470 --> 00:22:14,920
actually track

543
00:22:11,890 --> 00:22:17,350
your effort and and be able to go back

544
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:19,270
you know through history and look at the

545
00:22:17,350 --> 00:22:21,429
stages of development and say oh this

546
00:22:19,270 --> 00:22:23,980
was this was clearly background IP that

547
00:22:21,430 --> 00:22:25,690
I brought to the table and finally there

548
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:29,460
should be a clear separation agreement

549
00:22:25,690 --> 00:22:34,710
to avoid later later questions or

550
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:34,710
argument over who owns what in that IP

551
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:42,790
alright so it's one of my favorite ones

552
00:22:38,910 --> 00:22:46,900
three guys I know LC so you know it's

553
00:22:42,790 --> 00:22:48,790
lots than this this space right so after

554
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:50,860
working on the sock team for an online

555
00:22:48,790 --> 00:22:52,780
gaming company three developers decide

556
00:22:50,860 --> 00:22:54,719
that they can build a better Analyst

557
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:57,399
tool platform and the one they're using

558
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:59,590
currently at the game company sounds a

559
00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:01,780
great idea three of them quit the game

560
00:22:59,590 --> 00:23:04,030
company work on the projects for six

561
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:06,129
months before they unfortunately run out

562
00:23:04,030 --> 00:23:08,820
of money without acquiring any new

563
00:23:06,130 --> 00:23:10,390
clients for their awesome platform

564
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:11,770
personally I think it because they're

565
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:14,920
selling the wrong people but that's just

566
00:23:11,770 --> 00:23:16,629
me anyway so two of the guys want to

567
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:18,040
open-source the project and one of the

568
00:23:16,630 --> 00:23:20,650
guys wants to sell the project basically

569
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:22,810
to any company they can shop it to and

570
00:23:20,650 --> 00:23:25,390
get some return on the investment that

571
00:23:22,810 --> 00:23:27,340
they put into it when the other two

572
00:23:25,390 --> 00:23:29,040
don't agree to his idea the third guy

573
00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:32,020
grabs all the source code documentation

574
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:37,659
takes off on his own and he successfully

575
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:40,270
sells it yeah all right so the

576
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:42,010
purchasing company took the legal

577
00:23:40,270 --> 00:23:43,690
position that they purchased the

578
00:23:42,010 --> 00:23:46,330
software and documentation from an owner

579
00:23:43,690 --> 00:23:48,100
of the company and any internal problems

580
00:23:46,330 --> 00:23:51,129
there might be with that company and

581
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:53,350
things like that didn't have anything to

582
00:23:51,130 --> 00:23:56,320
do with them not our problem we

583
00:23:53,350 --> 00:23:57,719
purchased it legit from an owner the two

584
00:23:56,320 --> 00:24:00,340
developers want the open source project

585
00:23:57,720 --> 00:24:03,030
sued the third developer and the

586
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:05,679
purchasing company as you would expect

587
00:24:03,030 --> 00:24:09,670
and in both the purchasing company and

588
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:11,860
the newly rich third developer have

589
00:24:09,670 --> 00:24:14,740
plenty of money right you got two other

590
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:16,508
developers out here with no software no

591
00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:18,429
money left and

592
00:24:16,509 --> 00:24:22,799
a couple of groups that have plenty of

593
00:24:18,429 --> 00:24:22,799
money to grind them down with lawsuits

594
00:24:24,449 --> 00:24:29,769
okay so so first some best practices

595
00:24:27,699 --> 00:24:32,679
that you could have should have would

596
00:24:29,769 --> 00:24:35,440
have followed would have been having

597
00:24:32,679 --> 00:24:36,999
formation documents so when you're out

598
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:40,359
and you're starting a new company

599
00:24:36,999 --> 00:24:42,039
whether you're creating a corporation if

600
00:24:40,359 --> 00:24:44,019
it's a corporation will create corporate

601
00:24:42,039 --> 00:24:46,179
bylaws creating a limited liability

602
00:24:44,019 --> 00:24:50,799
company you want an operating agreement

603
00:24:46,179 --> 00:24:54,159
those formation documents spell out the

604
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:55,359
the rights and obligations of the folks

605
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:57,519
that are running a company that are

606
00:24:55,359 --> 00:25:00,698
setting up the company and so oftentimes

607
00:24:57,519 --> 00:25:03,519
in those formation documents you'll

608
00:25:00,699 --> 00:25:05,829
you'll have provisions the detail what

609
00:25:03,519 --> 00:25:08,669
happens upon departure of one of the

610
00:25:05,829 --> 00:25:12,249
principles or general

611
00:25:08,669 --> 00:25:14,919
separation or dissolution of the entity

612
00:25:12,249 --> 00:25:16,449
what happens to the IP you can have

613
00:25:14,919 --> 00:25:17,949
buyout provisions

614
00:25:16,449 --> 00:25:20,229
spelled out up front and that type of

615
00:25:17,949 --> 00:25:21,639
document so that everybody knows when

616
00:25:20,229 --> 00:25:25,179
you're coming into that separation

617
00:25:21,639 --> 00:25:27,968
scenario what how you calculate what

618
00:25:25,179 --> 00:25:30,819
someone gets at that point it can

619
00:25:27,969 --> 00:25:33,009
establish requirements for key decisions

620
00:25:30,819 --> 00:25:35,079
that are going to be made like things

621
00:25:33,009 --> 00:25:37,989
like this position of the intellectual

622
00:25:35,079 --> 00:25:39,819
property of the company so you know the

623
00:25:37,989 --> 00:25:42,219
key takeaway there is it would have been

624
00:25:39,819 --> 00:25:44,139
great for them to have those formation

625
00:25:42,219 --> 00:25:47,759
documents but they don't have a time

626
00:25:44,139 --> 00:25:50,769
machine so here's where we end up

627
00:25:47,759 --> 00:25:54,009
developing software software is in

628
00:25:50,769 --> 00:25:56,440
general most fundamentally protectable

629
00:25:54,009 --> 00:25:58,239
by copyright there are instances where

630
00:25:56,440 --> 00:26:00,669
it can be protected by patent but from a

631
00:25:58,239 --> 00:26:04,239
copyright perspective we were dealing

632
00:26:00,669 --> 00:26:08,559
with rights of co-authors in that work

633
00:26:04,239 --> 00:26:11,440
and so absent a separate agreement among

634
00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:13,869
those co-authors of the software the

635
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:16,690
source code and the documentation are

636
00:26:13,869 --> 00:26:20,769
owned by the co-authors that created

637
00:26:16,690 --> 00:26:22,709
them so what that means is that each one

638
00:26:20,769 --> 00:26:26,049
of the co-authors has an undivided

639
00:26:22,709 --> 00:26:27,950
ownership share in the entire work of

640
00:26:26,049 --> 00:26:30,300
the source code

641
00:26:27,950 --> 00:26:32,790
that means because they have an equal

642
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:35,100
and undivided interest each one can go

643
00:26:32,790 --> 00:26:38,190
out without asking permission of the

644
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:40,439
other co-authors and they can use it

645
00:26:38,190 --> 00:26:42,600
they can sell it they can grant

646
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:45,480
non-exclusive licenses to other parties

647
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:47,939
to go and use that software they do

648
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:50,000
under copyright law have a duty to

649
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:52,350
account to the other co-authors for

650
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:55,740
profits that they generate from

651
00:26:52,350 --> 00:26:57,899
exploiting the work they can also go out

652
00:26:55,740 --> 00:27:01,170
and assign their ownership share or sell

653
00:26:57,900 --> 00:27:03,360
their ownership share to someone else so

654
00:27:01,170 --> 00:27:06,480
where does that leave us you that you

655
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:09,750
then have these co-authors as co-owners

656
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:11,520
of the software each one who is now able

657
00:27:09,750 --> 00:27:15,300
to go out and freely use the software

658
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:17,700
with years of litigation down the road

659
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:20,190
suing one another over oh you owe me

660
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:22,350
four four for selling the software over

661
00:27:20,190 --> 00:27:24,660
here no but you owe me for selling

662
00:27:22,350 --> 00:27:26,520
software over there again issues that

663
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:31,830
could have been resolved by way of

664
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:33,330
having formation documents upfront all

665
00:27:31,830 --> 00:27:37,230
right how that one actually actually

666
00:27:33,330 --> 00:27:39,629
ended was they did go on for years the

667
00:27:37,230 --> 00:27:41,310
the one software developer ended up

668
00:27:39,630 --> 00:27:44,190
finally coming to some sort of terms

669
00:27:41,310 --> 00:27:45,899
with the other two co-authors nowhere

670
00:27:44,190 --> 00:27:48,150
near what it costs everybody or the time

671
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:49,680
put in things like that all right so

672
00:27:48,150 --> 00:27:52,380
this next section I like to call get

673
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:54,660
free legal advice from Greg I don't

674
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:56,250
think Greg likes that but the little

675
00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:58,500
quick scenarios that we didn't have time

676
00:27:56,250 --> 00:28:00,390
to build out full scenarios for so in

677
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:02,550
this case we have a situation where my

678
00:28:00,390 --> 00:28:04,380
employer says that the work for hire

679
00:28:02,550 --> 00:28:06,240
doctrine means that everything I create

680
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:07,710
while employed at the company belongs to

681
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:09,900
them everything you do we've heard this

682
00:28:07,710 --> 00:28:11,940
before right everything you create do

683
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:13,740
think about while you're here working

684
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:18,480
for me belongs to me

685
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:19,800
right and that is not the case we talked

686
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:23,490
about software's protectable by

687
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:28,200
copyright work-for-hire is strictly a

688
00:28:23,490 --> 00:28:32,880
copyright doctrine it only exists under

689
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:34,560
copyright law so and basically the the

690
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:36,950
meaning of work for hire is any

691
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:39,090
copyright of a work of an employee is

692
00:28:36,950 --> 00:28:41,310
created within the scope of that

693
00:28:39,090 --> 00:28:44,639
employment is the prop

694
00:28:41,310 --> 00:28:47,520
of the employer so does that mean that

695
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:50,940
stuff that you work on moonlighting at

696
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:53,760
home belongs to the employer I'll give

697
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:58,080
you a typical legal lawyer answer of it

698
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:59,550
depends are you an employee and are you

699
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:02,010
working within the scope of your

700
00:28:59,550 --> 00:29:05,370
employment when you're developing that

701
00:29:02,010 --> 00:29:07,860
work if so it's worked for hire and it

702
00:29:05,370 --> 00:29:10,199
belongs to the employer if it's

703
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:12,120
something that's your own project that

704
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:14,790
you're working off on site if you're not

705
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:17,010
getting paid to work on that project at

706
00:29:14,790 --> 00:29:18,780
night then it's probably outside of the

707
00:29:17,010 --> 00:29:21,629
scope of your employment it's outside of

708
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:24,300
of the work for hire doctrine but

709
00:29:21,630 --> 00:29:26,730
importantly it's that that work for hire

710
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:30,300
doctrine is just an animal under

711
00:29:26,730 --> 00:29:33,330
copyright law and we'll talk shortly

712
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:38,879
about about patent issues and and why

713
00:29:33,330 --> 00:29:41,580
they're different yes so yeah when you

714
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:43,590
head right yeah so next question so if

715
00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:46,020
the source code I wrote is copyrighted

716
00:29:43,590 --> 00:29:48,899
by my employer I can't make anything

717
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:49,410
like that does that is that where we

718
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:52,380
stand

719
00:29:49,410 --> 00:29:56,190
no well the code itself might be

720
00:29:52,380 --> 00:29:58,970
copyrighted the copyright does not

721
00:29:56,190 --> 00:30:01,470
protect the functions of the code

722
00:29:58,970 --> 00:30:03,830
copyrights protect literal expression

723
00:30:01,470 --> 00:30:07,410
and so when we're talking about software

724
00:30:03,830 --> 00:30:10,710
that means it protects the literal code

725
00:30:07,410 --> 00:30:15,060
itself it does not protect what the

726
00:30:10,710 --> 00:30:17,400
software does so there there can be a

727
00:30:15,060 --> 00:30:20,580
competing product that performs pretty

728
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:23,100
much identical function but if it does

729
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:26,010
it by way of different code that someone

730
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:26,969
wrote entirely independently then that's

731
00:30:26,010 --> 00:30:30,030
not going to be copyright infringement

732
00:30:26,970 --> 00:30:32,640
and you can have that type of competing

733
00:30:30,030 --> 00:30:35,129
product out in the marketplace as long

734
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:37,620
as that code writer didn't see the

735
00:30:35,130 --> 00:30:39,450
original code and say okay I see how

736
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:41,100
that works I'm going to going to go and

737
00:30:39,450 --> 00:30:43,680
write essentially the same thing

738
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:45,389
substantially similar copy of that

739
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:47,880
original work that's not infringement

740
00:30:45,390 --> 00:30:51,000
they're they're totally clear and making

741
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:53,400
a competitive product but let's say that

742
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:55,160
that piece of software that they've come

743
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:57,620
up with is something

744
00:30:55,160 --> 00:31:00,530
that is potentially patentable there is

745
00:30:57,620 --> 00:31:02,810
a new invention that's embodied in the

746
00:31:00,530 --> 00:31:06,980
functions that are performed by that

747
00:31:02,810 --> 00:31:08,690
software so if the innovation in that

748
00:31:06,980 --> 00:31:12,110
piece of software rises to the level of

749
00:31:08,690 --> 00:31:16,670
a potentially patentable invention the

750
00:31:12,110 --> 00:31:18,560
employee owns the invention unless

751
00:31:16,670 --> 00:31:20,090
there's a written agreement with the

752
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:24,110
employee that spells out that the

753
00:31:20,090 --> 00:31:26,929
employer owns it or the employee was

754
00:31:24,110 --> 00:31:29,780
specifically hired to invent the thing

755
00:31:26,930 --> 00:31:31,520
that is patented so this is a really

756
00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:34,810
really common misunderstanding you know

757
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:38,420
tech tech employers and tech employees

758
00:31:34,810 --> 00:31:41,360
assume that if the employee is

759
00:31:38,420 --> 00:31:43,790
developing something that it just

760
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:45,709
generally relates to the business of the

761
00:31:43,790 --> 00:31:47,780
company and it's something that they can

762
00:31:45,710 --> 00:31:49,970
patent that the employer owns it and

763
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:51,830
that is not the case yeah they're

764
00:31:49,970 --> 00:31:53,930
thinking and that work-for-hire sense

765
00:31:51,830 --> 00:31:56,270
but the work for hire doctrine as I

766
00:31:53,930 --> 00:31:59,450
mentioned is only an animal under

767
00:31:56,270 --> 00:32:01,490
copyright law has no bearing on patent

768
00:31:59,450 --> 00:32:03,020
law and and inventions just have a

769
00:32:01,490 --> 00:32:06,050
little bit of a higher status than

770
00:32:03,020 --> 00:32:08,150
copyright over works and so because of

771
00:32:06,050 --> 00:32:12,770
that we treat ownership of them

772
00:32:08,150 --> 00:32:14,840
differently so absent either one of one

773
00:32:12,770 --> 00:32:16,960
of those issues of the employee being

774
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:19,070
hired to invent a specific thing or

775
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:20,450
there being a written agreement with the

776
00:32:19,070 --> 00:32:24,320
employee that says that the employer

777
00:32:20,450 --> 00:32:26,390
owns it then the employee can certainly

778
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:29,179
use the invention can even follow their

779
00:32:26,390 --> 00:32:35,690
own patent application and obtain patent

780
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:40,240
protection for that for that product how

781
00:32:35,690 --> 00:32:40,240
many even knew that one I had no idea

782
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:55,800
that's right so the question was looking

783
00:32:53,430 --> 00:32:58,500
at that Third Point if either of those

784
00:32:55,800 --> 00:33:02,040
conditions is met right so it's if there

785
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:04,110
is a written agreement that obligates

786
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:06,030
the employee to assign to the employer

787
00:33:04,110 --> 00:33:08,729
then the invention would be the

788
00:33:06,030 --> 00:33:11,670
employers and likewise if the employee

789
00:33:08,730 --> 00:33:14,100
was hired to invent a specific thing

790
00:33:11,670 --> 00:33:16,470
then the invention becomes the employers

791
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:24,330
any other scenario the employee still

792
00:33:16,470 --> 00:33:29,280
owns it yeah okay so my non-compete says

793
00:33:24,330 --> 00:33:32,490
I can't work at company X what do we do

794
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:35,510
there so we've got this issue of

795
00:33:32,490 --> 00:33:38,970
non-competes being overly broad and

796
00:33:35,510 --> 00:33:43,920
employers at times taking certain steps

797
00:33:38,970 --> 00:33:45,540
to be a little bit overbearing in what

798
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:47,570
they're looking for in those types of

799
00:33:45,540 --> 00:33:50,310
agreements you might have an employee

800
00:33:47,570 --> 00:33:53,520
sign an agreement that kind of blindly

801
00:33:50,310 --> 00:33:55,860
ties them to unnecessarily binding

802
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:58,470
limitations you know you're starting a

803
00:33:55,860 --> 00:34:00,570
new job you're going in you've got a

804
00:33:58,470 --> 00:34:02,220
whole bunch of paperwork to sign you

805
00:34:00,570 --> 00:34:03,929
know this form that form in that form

806
00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:06,390
and one of the forms have slipped in

807
00:34:03,930 --> 00:34:08,940
there's a non-compete really want to be

808
00:34:06,390 --> 00:34:10,800
careful in that scenario if you're

809
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:12,540
presented with a non-compete agreement

810
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:15,330
it really makes sense to have an

811
00:34:12,540 --> 00:34:18,690
attorney review it at a minimum don't

812
00:34:15,330 --> 00:34:20,250
sit there and sign it in the flurry of

813
00:34:18,690 --> 00:34:22,620
activity of going through a stack of

814
00:34:20,250 --> 00:34:24,900
documents your first week of work at a

815
00:34:22,620 --> 00:34:27,330
minimum take it home read it over be

816
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:30,120
really clear when limitations that it's

817
00:34:27,330 --> 00:34:33,060
setting out again they're supposed to be

818
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:36,719
reasonable in scope and duration so some

819
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:39,480
some agreement that says you as a code

820
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:42,359
writer can't work in the software field

821
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:45,409
for the next five years is not going to

822
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:47,580
be enforceable anywhere because then

823
00:34:45,409 --> 00:34:50,609
that that type of agreement would

824
00:34:47,580 --> 00:34:52,739
deprive a person from their livelihood

825
00:34:50,610 --> 00:34:54,780
right and courts are not going to

826
00:34:52,739 --> 00:34:56,939
enforce an agreement that's going to

827
00:34:54,780 --> 00:34:58,890
just totally bar someone from being able

828
00:34:56,940 --> 00:35:00,520
to go out and earn a livelihood now the

829
00:34:58,890 --> 00:35:01,990
important part there was

830
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:03,730
the court will enforce it that means

831
00:35:01,990 --> 00:35:06,009
you're not gonna get hired at that new

832
00:35:03,730 --> 00:35:07,330
employer that you know nobody's gonna

833
00:35:06,010 --> 00:35:09,040
want to hire you because of this out

834
00:35:07,330 --> 00:35:11,170
existing non-compete issue that you've

835
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:13,480
got going and you're gonna have to spend

836
00:35:11,170 --> 00:35:15,280
money and time that you don't have in a

837
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:17,730
courtroom to eventually win on a really

838
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:17,730
easy matter

839
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:22,660
sweeping descriptions that are designed

840
00:35:19,930 --> 00:35:24,190
to minimize competition competition risk

841
00:35:22,660 --> 00:35:27,190
unenforceability by attempting to

842
00:35:24,190 --> 00:35:29,350
control non confidential information so

843
00:35:27,190 --> 00:35:31,390
you might see agreements that just that

844
00:35:29,350 --> 00:35:35,170
say anything and everything that deals

845
00:35:31,390 --> 00:35:38,020
with software is my confidential

846
00:35:35,170 --> 00:35:39,700
information as the employer obviously

847
00:35:38,020 --> 00:35:41,920
that's that's not the case stuff that is

848
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:43,720
generally known information background

849
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:45,880
information that's not confidential

850
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:48,279
information and even if the agreement

851
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:50,530
spells out that you're obligated to keep

852
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:52,510
that as confidential ultimately that

853
00:35:50,530 --> 00:35:55,570
type of provision is not going to be

854
00:35:52,510 --> 00:35:58,780
enforceable but the key issue I mean

855
00:35:55,570 --> 00:36:00,730
Brian just mentioned it it's all of this

856
00:35:58,780 --> 00:36:03,640
is subjective and the way it gets

857
00:36:00,730 --> 00:36:05,770
decided is after you've gone through a

858
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:10,390
costly litigation it's why it's best to

859
00:36:05,770 --> 00:36:11,980
deal with these issues upfront and my

860
00:36:10,390 --> 00:36:15,790
former employer says that everything's a

861
00:36:11,980 --> 00:36:17,140
trade secret so general information

862
00:36:15,790 --> 00:36:20,080
that's relevant to an employee's

863
00:36:17,140 --> 00:36:22,930
technical field and that's known in the

864
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:25,440
industry cannot be confidential

865
00:36:22,930 --> 00:36:27,640
information or a trade secret

866
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:29,920
confidential information and trade

867
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:31,900
secret information is information that

868
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:36,700
is confidential that is kept

869
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:42,880
confidential and that is secret in order

870
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:46,569
to avail itself protection under trade

871
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:50,290
secret laws information has to be number

872
00:36:46,570 --> 00:36:52,000
one commercially valuable to the person

873
00:36:50,290 --> 00:36:54,400
who owns it and number two must be the

874
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:58,150
subject of reasonable measures to

875
00:36:54,400 --> 00:37:00,130
maintain its secrecy literally locking

876
00:36:58,150 --> 00:37:03,190
up the cot the information having

877
00:37:00,130 --> 00:37:07,360
restrictions having things like password

878
00:37:03,190 --> 00:37:10,720
access to the information locking up

879
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:11,170
physical information in in safes and so

880
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:13,959
on

881
00:37:11,170 --> 00:37:16,940
a failure of the employer to

882
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:18,110
specifically identify to the employee

883
00:37:16,940 --> 00:37:21,230
what is confidential or proprietary

884
00:37:18,110 --> 00:37:23,840
information leaves the question open so

885
00:37:21,230 --> 00:37:26,810
it's really really a good idea to have

886
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:28,700
that spelled out at the outset again in

887
00:37:26,810 --> 00:37:31,700
some written agreement with the employee

888
00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:34,100
that says this is our off information

889
00:37:31,700 --> 00:37:35,720
this is the scope of what we consider to

890
00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:37,310
be confidential and trade secret

891
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:39,950
information if you have that at the

892
00:37:37,310 --> 00:37:43,009
outset then that employer employee

893
00:37:39,950 --> 00:37:45,529
relationship can or I should say the end

894
00:37:43,010 --> 00:37:47,990
of that employee employer relationship

895
00:37:45,530 --> 00:37:50,810
can go so much more smoothly because the

896
00:37:47,990 --> 00:37:54,020
employee understands what they can use

897
00:37:50,810 --> 00:37:55,220
what they can't use if maybe the

898
00:37:54,020 --> 00:37:56,870
employer is being a little bit

899
00:37:55,220 --> 00:37:59,000
unreasonable and what they're trying to

900
00:37:56,870 --> 00:38:00,680
define is information but in any event

901
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:04,100
it's best to get that spelled out

902
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:05,390
upfront but if there's a dispute once

903
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:08,900
again the only way is kind of get

904
00:38:05,390 --> 00:38:10,910
resolved is through costly litigation

905
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:13,460
what's interesting about that is

906
00:38:10,910 --> 00:38:15,589
generally known information technical

907
00:38:13,460 --> 00:38:18,410
information in the industry think about

908
00:38:15,590 --> 00:38:21,350
our industry network traffic analysis

909
00:38:18,410 --> 00:38:23,450
anomaly detection from forensics to

910
00:38:21,350 --> 00:38:25,460
endpoint monitoring to to all those

911
00:38:23,450 --> 00:38:28,220
things those are generally well known

912
00:38:25,460 --> 00:38:31,540
rail research well-trod over well

913
00:38:28,220 --> 00:38:33,680
published areas it's hard to actually

914
00:38:31,540 --> 00:38:36,380
legitimately come up with a thing where

915
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:39,080
you go this is a hundred percent unique

916
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:45,380
to that space and nobody else has ever

917
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:49,370
heard of it have thought of it my former

918
00:38:45,380 --> 00:38:52,930
employer has policy I never saw it's

919
00:38:49,370 --> 00:38:52,930
really important for an employer to

920
00:38:52,990 --> 00:38:59,509
Matina tech industry to have policies

921
00:38:55,610 --> 00:39:02,480
that clearly spell out how they secure

922
00:38:59,510 --> 00:39:04,160
information they might be called upon

923
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:06,230
later on to demonstrate that they took

924
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:08,299
reasonable measures to maintain the

925
00:39:06,230 --> 00:39:09,680
secrecy of the information it's going to

926
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:11,240
be more difficult to do that if they

927
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:13,160
didn't have a policy that spells it out

928
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:14,930
what's more if they didn't have a policy

929
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:17,810
spell it out and they try to sue the

930
00:39:14,930 --> 00:39:18,950
employee who is now working for a

931
00:39:17,810 --> 00:39:21,590
competitor and they're saying hey you

932
00:39:18,950 --> 00:39:24,980
took my confidential information if the

933
00:39:21,590 --> 00:39:26,970
employee then is able to establish look

934
00:39:24,980 --> 00:39:28,950
you never had a policy that

935
00:39:26,970 --> 00:39:30,600
dictated or defined what was your

936
00:39:28,950 --> 00:39:32,250
confidential information now you're

937
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:34,350
coming at me saying all this stuff that

938
00:39:32,250 --> 00:39:37,950
I knew in the past is confidential no no

939
00:39:34,350 --> 00:39:40,830
that it doesn't work that way then

940
00:39:37,950 --> 00:39:42,629
finally an employer should have physical

941
00:39:40,830 --> 00:39:44,790
electronic controls to minimize risk of

942
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:46,100
intentional or unintentional exposure of

943
00:39:44,790 --> 00:39:48,810
confidential or trade secret information

944
00:39:46,100 --> 00:39:51,450
again it just makes sense to have those

945
00:39:48,810 --> 00:39:54,150
policies to have the infrastructure in

946
00:39:51,450 --> 00:39:57,470
place that protects that confidential

947
00:39:54,150 --> 00:39:57,470
and proprietary information

948
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:04,590
all right checklist the checklist so we

949
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:06,839
tried to come up with as many things as

950
00:40:04,590 --> 00:40:09,420
we could that you could use for yourself

951
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:11,310
to friends in the future share it all

952
00:40:09,420 --> 00:40:13,020
that sort of stuff to prevent yourself

953
00:40:11,310 --> 00:40:17,549
from getting into these ugly sort of

954
00:40:13,020 --> 00:40:19,650
situations it is information that a

955
00:40:17,550 --> 00:40:21,120
former employer is complaining about a

956
00:40:19,650 --> 00:40:24,740
trade secret or confidential information

957
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:27,960
or is it general industry knowledge as

958
00:40:24,740 --> 00:40:32,339
the tech employee it's good for you to

959
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:34,560
try to keep keep a log if you can but

960
00:40:32,340 --> 00:40:38,400
just try to be aware as you're working

961
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:40,410
on projects of what's really proprietary

962
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:43,230
to the employer and what's clearly

963
00:40:40,410 --> 00:40:45,029
background information what's Jen what

964
00:40:43,230 --> 00:40:49,670
information is just general knowledge

965
00:40:45,030 --> 00:40:53,190
that that's used in the field if your

966
00:40:49,670 --> 00:40:55,620
position changes over time with a former

967
00:40:53,190 --> 00:40:58,500
employer might be the case that you

968
00:40:55,620 --> 00:40:59,940
non-compete is no longer relevant to the

969
00:40:58,500 --> 00:41:02,160
duties that you had at a time of

970
00:40:59,940 --> 00:41:06,030
departure so if it's spelled out that

971
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:08,190
you can't compete in this certain box of

972
00:41:06,030 --> 00:41:10,530
where you were when you start an

973
00:41:08,190 --> 00:41:12,960
employment but at the end of the

974
00:41:10,530 --> 00:41:15,090
relationship your job has changed so

975
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:18,300
much that you're no longer within that

976
00:41:15,090 --> 00:41:20,970
Square well if you take a job that's

977
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:23,310
kind of in that same position of where

978
00:41:20,970 --> 00:41:25,470
you ended up the former employer and the

979
00:41:23,310 --> 00:41:26,910
non-compete for your old old position

980
00:41:25,470 --> 00:41:28,859
just isn't going to be enforceable

981
00:41:26,910 --> 00:41:30,029
against a new position that was critical

982
00:41:28,860 --> 00:41:32,600
whether our worst salesman in the world

983
00:41:30,030 --> 00:41:36,720
he worked as a salesperson at company a

984
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:38,460
he worked as a VP of Sales at Company B

985
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:40,740
he didn't actually do sales anymore he

986
00:41:38,460 --> 00:41:41,250
ran an entire sales team it wasn't

987
00:41:40,740 --> 00:41:45,479
directly

988
00:41:41,250 --> 00:41:46,950
interacting with clients if you're

989
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:51,030
required to sign an agreement when

990
00:41:46,950 --> 00:41:53,490
you're departing are you compensated so

991
00:41:51,030 --> 00:41:55,320
that an ideal time for an employer to

992
00:41:53,490 --> 00:41:58,020
present an employee with a non-compete

993
00:41:55,320 --> 00:42:00,360
is when they're coming in when they're

994
00:41:58,020 --> 00:42:03,120
first hired or maybe go through a

995
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:05,250
process and and the company is deciding

996
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:08,220
look we want to update all of our forms

997
00:42:05,250 --> 00:42:09,780
all of our employee related policies so

998
00:42:08,220 --> 00:42:12,629
they're going to present know kind of

999
00:42:09,780 --> 00:42:15,330
company-wide non-compete agreements

1000
00:42:12,630 --> 00:42:16,380
that's fine but if you're bullied on

1001
00:42:15,330 --> 00:42:19,590
your way out the door

1002
00:42:16,380 --> 00:42:22,130
yes but in House Counsel coming and

1003
00:42:19,590 --> 00:42:24,600
saying you need to sign this or else

1004
00:42:22,130 --> 00:42:26,610
well in order for that agreement to be

1005
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:28,560
enforceable they're going to have to

1006
00:42:26,610 --> 00:42:29,880
give you something in order to have a

1007
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:32,220
valid contract you need what we call

1008
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:34,710
consideration some exchange of value and

1009
00:42:32,220 --> 00:42:37,080
so if they're trying to force you to

1010
00:42:34,710 --> 00:42:39,090
sign a non-compete as you're going out

1011
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:41,910
the door but they're not giving you

1012
00:42:39,090 --> 00:42:44,070
something in exchange presumably some

1013
00:42:41,910 --> 00:42:45,660
type of severance and that agreements

1014
00:42:44,070 --> 00:42:47,910
not going to be supported by any any

1015
00:42:45,660 --> 00:42:50,040
value exchange from them to you it's not

1016
00:42:47,910 --> 00:42:52,230
going to be enforceable how many of you

1017
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:54,150
ever knew anybody and working in a sock

1018
00:42:52,230 --> 00:42:55,920
to get a severance when they left or a

1019
00:42:54,150 --> 00:42:58,650
network engineer Teta severance when

1020
00:42:55,920 --> 00:43:00,600
they left yeah it's a rare thing right

1021
00:42:58,650 --> 00:43:05,820
it's usually we need you to sign this

1022
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:08,160
and be on your way and looking at the

1023
00:43:05,820 --> 00:43:12,450
issue of enforceability and particularly

1024
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:15,149
I mentioned earlier the risk of being

1025
00:43:12,450 --> 00:43:20,160
exposed to an injunction where a former

1026
00:43:15,150 --> 00:43:22,530
employer is is trying to prevent the

1027
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:25,290
employment from continuing at the new at

1028
00:43:22,530 --> 00:43:27,180
the new employer key question is is

1029
00:43:25,290 --> 00:43:29,670
there a reparable harm or injury to the

1030
00:43:27,180 --> 00:43:32,580
to the former employee moving to a

1031
00:43:29,670 --> 00:43:35,040
competitor is there a reparable harm to

1032
00:43:32,580 --> 00:43:37,380
that former employer resulting from the

1033
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:39,900
employee moving if they can't show that

1034
00:43:37,380 --> 00:43:42,870
there's really a reparable harm they're

1035
00:43:39,900 --> 00:43:45,050
not going to be able to get that that

1036
00:43:42,870 --> 00:43:47,279
type of conjunction that type of relief

1037
00:43:45,050 --> 00:43:48,780
does the potential harm to the former

1038
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:50,310
employee created by the non-compete

1039
00:43:48,780 --> 00:43:52,620
outweigh the harms of the former

1040
00:43:50,310 --> 00:43:54,670
employer many many jurisdictions are

1041
00:43:52,620 --> 00:43:57,940
looking heavily at

1042
00:43:54,670 --> 00:44:01,180
at reasonableness and fairness when it

1043
00:43:57,940 --> 00:44:03,670
comes to enforceability of a non-compete

1044
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:07,060
agreement and so if the potential harm

1045
00:44:03,670 --> 00:44:09,430
to the employee is is so much greater

1046
00:44:07,060 --> 00:44:10,990
than the harm to the employer then a

1047
00:44:09,430 --> 00:44:13,149
court is and all likelihood at least

1048
00:44:10,990 --> 00:44:17,709
gonna scale back the scope of of the

1049
00:44:13,150 --> 00:44:20,710
non-compete did the former employer

1050
00:44:17,710 --> 00:44:23,860
burry the restrictive covenants in some

1051
00:44:20,710 --> 00:44:26,230
otherwise unrelated agreement for

1052
00:44:23,860 --> 00:44:31,090
instance you know did they revise

1053
00:44:26,230 --> 00:44:34,690
employee handbooks and in this 150 page

1054
00:44:31,090 --> 00:44:37,000
employee manual at page 75 they insert a

1055
00:44:34,690 --> 00:44:39,040
one page or non-compete agreement and

1056
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:41,410
then it's back they say here sign this

1057
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:44,620
form saying you agree to our new

1058
00:44:41,410 --> 00:44:47,160
policies well yes maybe the timing is

1059
00:44:44,620 --> 00:44:49,900
good on that non-compete but they can't

1060
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:52,149
that they can't slip it in you know

1061
00:44:49,900 --> 00:44:53,290
under the cover that way they're going

1062
00:44:52,150 --> 00:44:55,900
to have a lot of trouble trying to

1063
00:44:53,290 --> 00:44:59,020
enforce that type of that type of

1064
00:44:55,900 --> 00:45:01,000
document did the informer employer

1065
00:44:59,020 --> 00:45:02,770
simply wait too long to take action

1066
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:05,830
against the former employee and their

1067
00:45:02,770 --> 00:45:08,500
new employer did did the move take place

1068
00:45:05,830 --> 00:45:10,750
an employee went to a competitor you

1069
00:45:08,500 --> 00:45:13,330
know is putting out product it's in the

1070
00:45:10,750 --> 00:45:16,540
exact same competitive competitive space

1071
00:45:13,330 --> 00:45:18,610
as their former employer but the former

1072
00:45:16,540 --> 00:45:22,509
employer absolutely knows about it and

1073
00:45:18,610 --> 00:45:24,430
just waits two years to then come you

1074
00:45:22,510 --> 00:45:27,100
know despite having all that knowledge

1075
00:45:24,430 --> 00:45:30,190
to come in and enforce what is generally

1076
00:45:27,100 --> 00:45:33,009
to long great six months a year two

1077
00:45:30,190 --> 00:45:36,160
years it's gonna vary depending you know

1078
00:45:33,010 --> 00:45:40,050
on the hold on a situation on a lot of

1079
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:42,040
times on just a value of the product

1080
00:45:40,050 --> 00:45:44,590
statute of limitations in a lot of

1081
00:45:42,040 --> 00:45:46,300
jurisdictions is either two years or

1082
00:45:44,590 --> 00:45:49,900
three years so you know we're at least

1083
00:45:46,300 --> 00:45:51,760
dealing in that window but but for

1084
00:45:49,900 --> 00:45:54,180
something that's that's some type of

1085
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:56,500
huge project it could be as little as

1086
00:45:54,180 --> 00:45:58,690
six months if it's you know something

1087
00:45:56,500 --> 00:46:03,000
that everybody in the world knows these

1088
00:45:58,690 --> 00:46:03,000
two companies are our clear competitors

1089
00:46:03,570 --> 00:46:07,630
let's see just just real quick because

1090
00:46:06,340 --> 00:46:08,859
we want to leave a couple minutes for

1091
00:46:07,630 --> 00:46:11,260
questions

1092
00:46:08,859 --> 00:46:12,490
we've got a couple of other items here

1093
00:46:11,260 --> 00:46:14,710
former employer previously only

1094
00:46:12,490 --> 00:46:17,049
selectively enforced you got to be

1095
00:46:14,710 --> 00:46:20,170
uniform in your enforcement if you're a

1096
00:46:17,050 --> 00:46:21,760
low-level employee or low salary level

1097
00:46:20,170 --> 00:46:25,990
an employer is going to have a tough

1098
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:27,730
time enforcing a non-compete and then

1099
00:46:25,990 --> 00:46:29,709
again just the issue of fundamental

1100
00:46:27,730 --> 00:46:31,000
fairness enforcement of restrictive

1101
00:46:29,710 --> 00:46:32,859
covenants against the employee are

1102
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:35,380
simply unfair courts are going to look

1103
00:46:32,859 --> 00:46:38,500
at that basic issue of fairness the

1104
00:46:35,380 --> 00:46:41,650
quick doozer don'ts try to maintain a

1105
00:46:38,500 --> 00:46:44,500
log of any public information resources

1106
00:46:41,650 --> 00:46:46,570
open source that you use in your work so

1107
00:46:44,500 --> 00:46:49,000
you can establish the public nature of

1108
00:46:46,570 --> 00:46:51,160
that information if you're challenged

1109
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:53,830
after you've moved you want to be able

1110
00:46:51,160 --> 00:46:55,560
to defend against a claim that you're

1111
00:46:53,830 --> 00:46:57,670
misusing confidential proprietary

1112
00:46:55,560 --> 00:46:59,200
information if you've got documentation

1113
00:46:57,670 --> 00:47:01,810
to prove it they're gonna be way better

1114
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:03,368
off document your own individually

1115
00:47:01,810 --> 00:47:05,349
developed intellectual property that you

1116
00:47:03,369 --> 00:47:07,210
did while you were moonlighting so that

1117
00:47:05,349 --> 00:47:09,190
you can establish that it was truly an

1118
00:47:07,210 --> 00:47:11,710
independent effort outside of your

1119
00:47:09,190 --> 00:47:13,540
regular work out work efforts and the

1120
00:47:11,710 --> 00:47:15,369
big do not don't don't take the data

1121
00:47:13,540 --> 00:47:16,509
just just don't take the data don't

1122
00:47:15,369 --> 00:47:18,070
don't make me have to come and look

1123
00:47:16,510 --> 00:47:19,450
through your computer later I mean this

1124
00:47:18,070 --> 00:47:19,839
is what we do we do hundreds of cases a

1125
00:47:19,450 --> 00:47:22,270
year

1126
00:47:19,839 --> 00:47:23,830
don't make us find this stuff you know

1127
00:47:22,270 --> 00:47:25,900
on your computer and your home computer

1128
00:47:23,830 --> 00:47:27,580
and your thumb drive every stealthy way

1129
00:47:25,900 --> 00:47:30,160
you come up with come on that's what we

1130
00:47:27,580 --> 00:47:32,020
do don't don't do it it's better to just

1131
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:36,460
walk away clean like Grace's just just

1132
00:47:32,020 --> 00:47:39,480
compete with them straight up good

1133
00:47:36,460 --> 00:47:39,480
timing questions

1134
00:47:44,500 --> 00:47:48,620
so they make sure I heard the question

1135
00:47:46,700 --> 00:47:51,129
you're working for the company they

1136
00:47:48,620 --> 00:47:54,350
change their policy and you disagree

1137
00:47:51,130 --> 00:47:56,990
that's the employers prerogative so your

1138
00:47:54,350 --> 00:47:59,569
option there I mean it depends on your

1139
00:47:56,990 --> 00:48:02,089
negotiating values employee right so if

1140
00:47:59,570 --> 00:48:04,280
you're critical to the mission of the

1141
00:48:02,090 --> 00:48:06,230
company then you're going to negotiate

1142
00:48:04,280 --> 00:48:08,180
those terms maybe you've got a carve-out

1143
00:48:06,230 --> 00:48:09,860
you've got your own non-compete it's not

1144
00:48:08,180 --> 00:48:12,140
the form for the policies that they

1145
00:48:09,860 --> 00:48:15,170
changed and I would certainly recommend

1146
00:48:12,140 --> 00:48:16,850
that you ask that now say no I can't

1147
00:48:15,170 --> 00:48:18,830
agree with this I don't know what the

1148
00:48:16,850 --> 00:48:20,750
future holds for me I think because of

1149
00:48:18,830 --> 00:48:23,240
my particular circumstance I've got

1150
00:48:20,750 --> 00:48:26,900
pretty unique opportunities so let's sit

1151
00:48:23,240 --> 00:48:28,399
down and talk it through and and you

1152
00:48:26,900 --> 00:48:30,080
know let me understand what your

1153
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:31,550
concerns are so that we can clearly

1154
00:48:30,080 --> 00:48:33,980
carve out the fine

1155
00:48:31,550 --> 00:48:35,540
you know what that scope of non-compete

1156
00:48:33,980 --> 00:48:38,120
is I think that's probably the best way

1157
00:48:35,540 --> 00:48:40,490
to handle it what if I hire to the

1158
00:48:38,120 --> 00:48:43,190
company that's later sold to another

1159
00:48:40,490 --> 00:48:46,310
company and a new company says we have

1160
00:48:43,190 --> 00:48:47,930
this really strict policy on all this

1161
00:48:46,310 --> 00:48:50,870
and you're now an employee of that

1162
00:48:47,930 --> 00:48:53,210
company if they've got the strict policy

1163
00:48:50,870 --> 00:48:56,299
that's that's the policy right and

1164
00:48:53,210 --> 00:48:58,850
you've got to you got to educate

1165
00:48:56,300 --> 00:49:01,040
yourself before you start the employment

1166
00:48:58,850 --> 00:49:03,110
relationship because once you're in

1167
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:04,880
you're bound again if it's an

1168
00:49:03,110 --> 00:49:08,120
overbearing non-compete there might be

1169
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:18,700
enforceable 'ti issues but but it's it's

1170
00:49:08,120 --> 00:49:23,120
their policy no it's it's the employers

1171
00:49:18,700 --> 00:49:25,220
prerogative right so so they can yeah as

1172
00:49:23,120 --> 00:49:27,980
a condition as a condition of your

1173
00:49:25,220 --> 00:49:30,950
continued employment they are able to

1174
00:49:27,980 --> 00:49:32,480
say no we've changed a policy and so in

1175
00:49:30,950 --> 00:49:35,210
order for you to maintain your

1176
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:37,970
employment you need to need to sign this

1177
00:49:35,210 --> 00:49:41,030
document again you know and it depends

1178
00:49:37,970 --> 00:49:43,609
when you're really on your value as a as

1179
00:49:41,030 --> 00:49:46,940
a as an employee do you have the ability

1180
00:49:43,610 --> 00:49:49,510
to negotiate with them and spell out you

1181
00:49:46,940 --> 00:49:51,760
know your your carve out from the norm

1182
00:49:49,510 --> 00:49:53,170
you don't have to work there right it's

1183
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:54,010
not like the market stinks or anything

1184
00:49:53,170 --> 00:49:55,750
