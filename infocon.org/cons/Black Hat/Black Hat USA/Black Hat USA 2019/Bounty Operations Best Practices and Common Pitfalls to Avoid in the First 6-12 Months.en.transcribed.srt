nuts of two bolts of bug bounties and

23
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:03,420
you know sort of hey I'm thinking about

24
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:05,518

operations with a focus in the first six

46
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:06,570
to 12 months lessons learned their

47
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:08,160
experience running building changing

48
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:10,699
developing a bounty program that's

49
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:14,120
already off the ground so who are we

50
00:02:10,699 --> 00:02:16,040
so we've got shannon satan's greg

51
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:19,010
Casswell and josh j i'll give these guys

52
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:20,450
a chance to introduce himself why don't

53
00:02:19,010 --> 00:02:23,030
you get started sure thing

54
00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:25,910
my name is greg castle i'm a manager of

55
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:27,380
application security at indeed.com i've

56
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:29,390
been running our bug bounty program for

57
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:32,299
about five and a half years prior to

58
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:34,429
that I was doing dev work so it gives me

59
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:37,100
a good perspective of some of the the

60
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:39,709
pain points after we've tossed the bugs

61
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:42,200
over the wall so to speak

62
00:02:39,709 --> 00:02:43,640
I'm Josh Jayne my previous role I worked

63
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:45,530
for United Airlines have built out

64
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:48,470
managed the bug bounty program for

65
00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:52,030
United and now I'm at a currently at a

66
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:55,310
film studio working on body and app sec

67
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:58,160
I'm Shanon Saban's and I've been

68
00:02:55,310 --> 00:03:02,000
managing security programs for about 20

69
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:04,940
years and I have been at Trend Micro

70
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:09,470
with the zero day initiative bug bounty

71
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:11,690
for the last six years great so we have

72
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:13,700
a wide range of experience for a couple

73
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:15,350
different industry areas and the few

74
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:18,470
folks that run multiple bounty programs

75
00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:21,680
in different organizations so let's jump

76
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:24,079
right in first question we've got is how

77
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:25,489
you articulate how you explain your

78
00:03:24,079 --> 00:03:27,320
bounty program the value of your body

79
00:03:25,489 --> 00:03:29,959
program to your internal stakeholders I

80
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:31,579
know Adam covered a lot of the

81
00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:33,140
stakeholders you'll be talking to your

82
00:03:31,579 --> 00:03:35,269
legal department your engineering and

83
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:37,399
developers your executives leadership

84
00:03:35,269 --> 00:03:39,650
but from your organization's perspective

85
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:41,630
how how do you handle that that

86
00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:43,130
conversation kind of quickly I'll give

87
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:44,799
each three of you a chance to ask that

88
00:03:43,130 --> 00:03:49,970
question give me a little elevator pitch

89
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:52,250
I'm sure I'll kick it off the almost a

90
00:03:49,970 --> 00:03:55,010
catalyst for our program was that we

91
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:57,230
would get researchers that would send us

92
00:03:55,010 --> 00:03:59,540
emails or communicate dress the other

93
00:03:57,230 --> 00:04:01,130
channels saying that hey we found a bug

94
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:03,739
this is super serious if you give us

95
00:04:01,130 --> 00:04:08,060
some money we'll tell you what it is I

96
00:04:03,739 --> 00:04:09,980
never felt good and so that kind of

97
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:11,870
kicked off the desire to have an

98
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:15,679
explicit bug bounty program so that we

99
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:17,690
could ingest the findings safely find

100
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:18,380
out what it is they have or haven't

101
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:21,290
found

102
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:24,140
and work with them to to get it fixed

103
00:04:21,290 --> 00:04:28,790
and so at least these for us that was

104
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:31,010
one of the the big pieces of value for

105
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:33,740
us early on was just to get out of that

106
00:04:31,010 --> 00:04:35,330
weird communication cycle where both

107
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:36,980
sides didn't really trust each other and

108
00:04:35,330 --> 00:04:38,719
someone says you're a year in what's

109
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:40,220
going on I think it's just why we been

110
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:43,550
doing this is that still the same answer

111
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:47,090
oh there's a lot of other benefits we've

112
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:49,520
picked up since then we've not it

113
00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:51,590
definitely fixed that problem so we've

114
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:53,479
not seen it the past five and half years

115
00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:56,359
because any any time someone tries to

116
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:57,590
contact contact us outside of the normal

117
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:59,950
communication channels we can just point

118
00:04:57,590 --> 00:05:02,630
them back to our bounty program say

119
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:05,000
please submit through here once you have

120
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:06,800
you know let us know what ticket was so

121
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:12,340
we can start working it it just it keeps

122
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:12,340
the conversation in a in a good location

123
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:16,690
just getting them on the same page

124
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:18,710
developers and engineers or the

125
00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:20,270
stakeholders that I work with very

126
00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:23,270
closely but then they're also the people

127
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:26,840
that I need to have on board I mean you

128
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:30,109
can have your seaso your CEO CTO

129
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:31,219
whatever be totally on board but if it's

130
00:05:30,110 --> 00:05:32,630
not the engineering group or the

131
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:32,840
developers that are actually doing the

132
00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:35,030
work

133
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:38,960
then you're it's gonna fall apart right

134
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:40,369
there and I first start off being very

135
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:42,080
blunt and clear there's gonna be issues

136
00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:45,230
and it's not gonna be an easy road but

137
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:47,810
what's great is secure code is most

138
00:05:45,230 --> 00:05:49,940
likely gonna be also stable code so if

139
00:05:47,810 --> 00:05:52,160
we can get proactive and we keep working

140
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:54,590
and just develop and go through the

141
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:56,240
process get things fixed it ends up

142
00:05:54,590 --> 00:05:59,320
being a lot less work for them

143
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:04,070
in the long run it stabilizes their role

144
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:06,860
in theory Trend Micro we're a little bit

145
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:10,060
different at the CDI because we are

146
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:14,140
vendor agnostic a bug bounty program and

147
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:16,850
because we do share our intelligence

148
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:19,099
gratis with the vendor and partner with

149
00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:22,280
them to find remediation but we also

150
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:25,670
feed that intelligence back into our

151
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:28,190
tipping point product and back into

152
00:06:25,670 --> 00:06:31,340
trend generally to protect our customers

153
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:33,290
in advance of vendor patches so for us

154
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:37,520
that's the differentiator that's the

155
00:06:33,290 --> 00:06:39,980
value add that said it is a very

156
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:43,370
expensive program and we do want to

157
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:45,500
provide leadership in terms of white hat

158
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:47,990
research and we are very eager to

159
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:49,700
partner with others to help them with

160
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:51,860
their bug bounty it's not something that

161
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:53,930
we see you know as a competition but

162
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:57,890
something that we want to be a part of

163
00:06:53,930 --> 00:07:01,750
and help vendors or others where we can

164
00:06:57,890 --> 00:07:06,830
but for us that's the value proposition

165
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:09,050
thank you for our next question so right

166
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:10,729
again the Adam talked about how to set

167
00:07:09,050 --> 00:07:12,800
up all the options for designing about a

168
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:14,630
bounty program Chloe after this has a

169
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:16,669
great talk on long-term how to keep

170
00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:18,830
researchers and your own teams engaged

171
00:07:16,669 --> 00:07:21,740
freshened and continue to produce value

172
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:24,050
but after the first six to 12 months was

173
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:25,760
one of the hardest or most unexpected

174
00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:27,740
lessons that you learned something you

175
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:30,200
wish the audience they're just getting

176
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:36,890
started knows now instead of learns this

177
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:38,210
down the road I can start that off kind

178
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:40,030
of ties into a little bit of the

179
00:07:38,210 --> 00:07:42,620
previous question as well one of the

180
00:07:40,030 --> 00:07:44,359
pain points we experienced early on was

181
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:47,090
we got more submissions than we are

182
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:49,750
expecting at a certain point and some of

183
00:07:47,090 --> 00:07:52,099
that was how we set up our bounty

184
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:53,780
started it fairly quiet and then I call

185
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:55,610
that this is this is great it's not a

186
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:58,419
lot of volume and we cranked up the

187
00:07:55,610 --> 00:08:02,450
payout a good chunk and then got a

188
00:07:58,419 --> 00:08:04,609
significant spike in submissions which

189
00:08:02,450 --> 00:08:07,070
is great but then you've got to deal

190
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:08,300
with them I've got a work with all

191
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:13,060
engineering teams you've got to work

192
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:16,400
with researchers and it takes time I'm

193
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:18,020
the reason why it relates the previous

194
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:21,440
question a little bit is one of the

195
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:24,680
reasons we got flooded early on is we

196
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:25,820
found applications that we didn't even

197
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:28,250
necessarily know about on the security

198
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:30,380
team that it's like oh these are things

199
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:32,230
that our engineers are developing and

200
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:34,390
and pushing out there

201
00:08:32,230 --> 00:08:37,750
and they have some bugs they need to be

202
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:41,350
fixed but uh that was it was so it's in

203
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:43,240
mixbag days we were very happy to find

204
00:08:41,350 --> 00:08:46,330
out that some of our processes were

205
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:49,030
broken and the bounty program helped us

206
00:08:46,330 --> 00:08:50,470
identify you know where we could fix

207
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:52,449
those processes and those broken

208
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:54,490
communication channels at the same time

209
00:08:52,450 --> 00:08:56,320
we had to deal with that that influx of

210
00:08:54,490 --> 00:09:00,630
submissions and it was just his

211
00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:00,630
short-term pain but for long-term health

212
00:09:00,690 --> 00:09:06,700
for myself I think grossly miss

213
00:09:04,050 --> 00:09:09,250
understanding what the volume and scope

214
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:11,800
would be we were pretty confident based

215
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:14,140
off of what we got from a pseudo

216
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:16,750
responsible disclosure channel that it

217
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:19,689
would roughly echo that so we planned

218
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:22,180
accordingly scoped accordingly and boy

219
00:09:19,690 --> 00:09:24,970
were we wrong so we were just inundated

220
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:27,479
just between researchers submitting

221
00:09:24,970 --> 00:09:30,370
questions let alone actual submissions

222
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:31,930
there's also the media inquiries so it

223
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:34,510
just went from something that we felt

224
00:09:31,930 --> 00:09:37,479
was gonna be a slow roll out something

225
00:09:34,510 --> 00:09:40,660
quiet well it's the Internet it goes

226
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:43,510
viral pretty darn quickly and managing

227
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:45,730
and maintaining those expectations just

228
00:09:43,510 --> 00:09:48,010
from that flood was difficult and

229
00:09:45,730 --> 00:09:51,460
something we should have expected but

230
00:09:48,010 --> 00:09:56,160
definitely did not because we're vendor

231
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:58,780
agnostic program we have the luxury of

232
00:09:56,160 --> 00:10:01,780
kind of scraping off what we're not

233
00:09:58,780 --> 00:10:05,260
interested in and and saying thank you

234
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:07,420
very much but as the vendor and I talked

235
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:09,670
to a lot of a lot of our partners about

236
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:11,770
about their programs as the vendor you

237
00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:15,520
don't have that same luxury you really

238
00:10:11,770 --> 00:10:20,140
have to look at and triage everything so

239
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:22,060
in terms of a volume you're drinking

240
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:24,189
from the fire hose you're gonna have a

241
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:28,900
higher false positive rate that you're

242
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:30,790
going to have to to weed out coming

243
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:32,680
though from a recent because we're also

244
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:37,030
a research team coming from a research

245
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:39,609
team perspective making clear in in the

246
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:43,079
public space what your scope is for the

247
00:10:39,610 --> 00:10:49,570
program is really going to help you

248
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:52,300
kind of weed some of that out and so

249
00:10:49,570 --> 00:10:55,290
making clear you know what's in scope

250
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:57,910
what targets are most what products

251
00:10:55,290 --> 00:11:03,189
product targets coming from the research

252
00:10:57,910 --> 00:11:05,350
space are most valuable to you maybe you

253
00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:07,570
have a lot of third-party code but you

254
00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:09,460
want to see vulnerabilities in your own

255
00:11:07,570 --> 00:11:11,590
code or but making clear to that

256
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:11,830
research audience what your priorities

257
00:11:11,590 --> 00:11:14,710
are

258
00:11:11,830 --> 00:11:17,760
and what's in scope and and what's most

259
00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:21,330
valuable to you is incredibly important

260
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:24,970
and even you know we had talked about

261
00:11:21,330 --> 00:11:27,460
pricing I would say for us we have kind

262
00:11:24,970 --> 00:11:32,610
of a matrix these are product targets

263
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:35,230
that are most valuable to us do we have

264
00:11:32,610 --> 00:11:39,600
you know do we have a well documented

265
00:11:35,230 --> 00:11:42,070
report do we have a remote code execute

266
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:45,820
here and then having kind of a hierarchy

267
00:11:42,070 --> 00:11:48,520
of what's most valuable and and that can

268
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:50,860
be associated with your awards you may

269
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:53,920
not you may or may not wish to make your

270
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:55,870
awards payment public but helping the

271
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:58,360
audience that research audience

272
00:11:55,870 --> 00:12:00,970
understand what's most important and

273
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:03,660
what's most valuable to you will help

274
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:06,640
you get more of what you want and and

275
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:13,170
hopefully less of what you don't want

276
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:13,170
and even with regard to initial triage

277
00:12:13,470 --> 00:12:18,040
you know I'm not the most technical

278
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:20,890
person on the team but I can go through

279
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:22,270
that initial triage and say is it the

280
00:12:20,890 --> 00:12:24,490
product is it a product target we're

281
00:12:22,270 --> 00:12:26,650
very interested in is it well document

282
00:12:24,490 --> 00:12:30,510
it is it do we have a proof of concept

283
00:12:26,650 --> 00:12:33,880
all the things right I can do that

284
00:12:30,510 --> 00:12:36,880
everything doesn't have to go on to the

285
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:38,290
vetting team you take the time to get

286
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:40,360
everything you need and make sure you

287
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:41,860
have a well documented report before you

288
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:44,350
spend that send that on to more

289
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:47,690
expensive resources I would also say

290
00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:50,750
that payments are a huge

291
00:12:47,690 --> 00:12:55,880
and Android went into that a little bit

292
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:58,600
and I will tell you paying fast is a big

293
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:58,600
deal

294
00:12:58,660 --> 00:13:06,410
payments is incredibly challenging for

295
00:13:03,170 --> 00:13:08,900
some of the reasons you mentioned if

296
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:11,990
you're an American if you're an American

297
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:15,189
organization or whatever your country is

298
00:13:11,990 --> 00:13:16,400
you have certain restrictions sanctions

299
00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:18,590
what-have-you

300
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:21,260
you want to make sure that you

301
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:24,800
understand those well how you're gonna

302
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:27,880
pay if you're if you're playing as if

303
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:32,680
you're paying finders as contractors

304
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:35,780
what currencies are you gonna pay in and

305
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:38,000
so a lot of times the finders especially

306
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:39,800
if they're coming from you know if

307
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,200
you're in two different countries the

308
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:44,180
expectations about how you might be able

309
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:46,520
to pay versus how you're actually able

310
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:48,760
to pay the expectations can be very

311
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:51,680
mismatched you know your illegitimate

312
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:55,220
corporation and you you know and you

313
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:57,290
have these restrictions and finders you

314
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:59,600
know especially very young finders they

315
00:13:57,290 --> 00:14:01,640
don't always understand what that means

316
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:05,750
and what that looks like and you're

317
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:07,880
you're anonymous to the vendor may be

318
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:10,490
coming through Zvi program but you're

319
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:12,110
not anonymous to me and you're you may

320
00:14:10,490 --> 00:14:14,300
be credited you know if you're the

321
00:14:12,110 --> 00:14:17,480
vendor you may be credited anonymously

322
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:19,520
online but you to pay them you know you

323
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:21,170
didn't know who they are so those are

324
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:22,850
some challenges that I think you'll face

325
00:14:21,170 --> 00:14:24,740
right out of the gate that you need to

326
00:14:22,850 --> 00:14:28,790
put a lot of things a lot of thought

327
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:30,350
into yeah speaking about the payments

328
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:32,270
was just certainly a challenge we've

329
00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:34,100
been dealing with on that Microsoft site

330
00:14:32,270 --> 00:14:35,870
as well and making some progress there

331
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:38,089
how did you guys deal with that in your

332
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:41,839
organization's from the from the vendor

333
00:14:38,089 --> 00:14:44,390
side to outsource this just in town our

334
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:47,950
in-house what was there so at least for

335
00:14:44,390 --> 00:14:50,810
indeed we use a third-party vendor for

336
00:14:47,950 --> 00:14:54,150
initial triage and payout handling and

337
00:14:50,810 --> 00:14:57,180
I'm very happy to have

338
00:14:54,150 --> 00:14:59,189
I can't even imagine the difficulty it

339
00:14:57,180 --> 00:15:03,180
would be to try to handle the payments

340
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:05,070
yourself in a global company with all

341
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:10,589
the places that the submissions come in

342
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:12,810
from so being able to not have to do

343
00:15:10,590 --> 00:15:17,190
that part of the bounty program is saves

344
00:15:12,810 --> 00:15:22,290
us up to the time as far as the payouts

345
00:15:17,190 --> 00:15:23,700
themselves like scale and stuff at least

346
00:15:22,290 --> 00:15:26,069
from our perspective that's what that's

347
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:30,350
the kind of the primary lever we use to

348
00:15:26,070 --> 00:15:33,060
control volume if if our volumes too low

349
00:15:30,350 --> 00:15:35,790
then and and we want more submissions

350
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:39,060
than offering more money payout

351
00:15:35,790 --> 00:15:45,240
obviously will attract a larger crowd

352
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:47,699
dear program so for us at United our

353
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:49,560
goal or idea what we wanted to do is

354
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:52,560
actually build the program around miles

355
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:56,069
in general that was a core concept that

356
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:57,869
we thought was just neat something that

357
00:15:56,070 --> 00:16:01,380
we already had a mechanism for in the

358
00:15:57,870 --> 00:16:03,630
first place people traveled they already

359
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:06,030
get miles there's a whole process flow

360
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:07,710
that you netted already had embedded

361
00:16:06,030 --> 00:16:09,680
there so we're like awesome let's just

362
00:16:07,710 --> 00:16:12,660
leverage that and so that's what we did

363
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:14,310
we did buy it up a little bit more than

364
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:15,810
we could chew we thought you know a

365
00:16:14,310 --> 00:16:17,699
million miles would be a great incentive

366
00:16:15,810 --> 00:16:20,339
and we were definitely right

367
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:22,290
it was a huge incentive it was really

368
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:25,590
cool and we loved it and made us very

369
00:16:22,290 --> 00:16:28,260
unique and proud of that but yeah he was

370
00:16:25,590 --> 00:16:30,690
mentioning the kind of delegating or the

371
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:32,370
limiting for what the researchers are

372
00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:34,410
going for and going after we kind of had

373
00:16:32,370 --> 00:16:38,370
that mentality of go big or go home and

374
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:39,930
we definitely wanted to go home but we

375
00:16:38,370 --> 00:16:42,840
had to stick around and ended up being

376
00:16:39,930 --> 00:16:48,449
really cool was a fun unique way to do

377
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:52,800
it and so it's interesting so a partyer

378
00:16:48,450 --> 00:16:54,570
goal is to get as the vendor maybe you

379
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:57,150
want to see your vulnerability reports

380
00:16:54,570 --> 00:16:59,070
before somebody else or another program

381
00:16:57,150 --> 00:17:02,370
does that's why you're looking at doing

382
00:16:59,070 --> 00:17:05,500
this yourselves right so

383
00:17:02,370 --> 00:17:10,329
paying fast is a big differentiator

384
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:16,209
between you and somebody else we do all

385
00:17:10,329 --> 00:17:20,039
our own payment in-house and so I've

386
00:17:16,209 --> 00:17:22,299
been at CDI six years we've done 5500

387
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:26,709
vulnerabilities in to end with vendors

388
00:17:22,299 --> 00:17:29,230
over the years I have done 4,000 of

389
00:17:26,709 --> 00:17:33,010
those working with vendors it means I've

390
00:17:29,230 --> 00:17:35,289
done four thousand payments I've made

391
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:38,320
four thousand famous would I do this

392
00:17:35,289 --> 00:17:39,730
myself again it works very well and it's

393
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:40,270
great because you have a lot of control

394
00:17:39,730 --> 00:17:42,820
over it

395
00:17:40,270 --> 00:17:45,610
and and and you can pay fast but it is a

396
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:48,100
lot of overhead and would I choose to do

397
00:17:45,610 --> 00:17:52,120
that again or what I choose to do that

398
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:54,459
as a vendor I might not I might look at

399
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:57,250
outsourcing that to be very honest with

400
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:59,140
you once you have it set up and it's

401
00:17:57,250 --> 00:18:01,780
going well you know you have more

402
00:17:59,140 --> 00:18:04,570
control over how fast you pay but it is

403
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:06,879
a lot of overhead if you do it cash

404
00:18:04,570 --> 00:18:08,649
seriously consider outsourcing if it's

405
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:09,789
something unique like miles it can work

406
00:18:08,650 --> 00:18:12,580
out just fine

407
00:18:09,789 --> 00:18:16,120
but yeah otherwise cash is king and it

408
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:17,980
makes it a lot easier with a vendor yeah

409
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:20,189
those are good things to know before

410
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:23,530
getting too far down the road

411
00:18:20,190 --> 00:18:24,370
speaking of researchers the core of this

412
00:18:23,530 --> 00:18:26,440
business

413
00:18:24,370 --> 00:18:29,110
and additionally your own security teams

414
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:30,970
these guys are critical these people

415
00:18:29,110 --> 00:18:33,039
across the globe the Mara where they're

416
00:18:30,970 --> 00:18:35,440
coming from our critical piece of any

417
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:37,450
bounty program can you share some best

418
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:40,750
practices for working with the research

419
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:43,000
community as large or examples of time

420
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:45,789
some things gone great or bad and what

421
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:49,900
you've learned from that Josh what do

422
00:18:45,789 --> 00:18:53,590
you start up okay cool so read mention

423
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:55,179
ease but transparency is integral the

424
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:57,490
more transparent you are I mean don't

425
00:18:55,179 --> 00:18:59,289
air your dirty laundry and say hey Steve

426
00:18:57,490 --> 00:19:00,610
and Susan are really lazy right now but

427
00:18:59,289 --> 00:19:02,700
you know mark is usually really good

428
00:19:00,610 --> 00:19:05,289
dude I mean they don't need that level

429
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:07,809
but that transparency in constant

430
00:19:05,289 --> 00:19:11,289
communication templates

431
00:19:07,809 --> 00:19:13,269
is cheating as that may sound

432
00:19:11,289 --> 00:19:15,669
just a simple template hey we really

433
00:19:13,269 --> 00:19:17,440
appreciate you we're gonna get back to

434
00:19:15,669 --> 00:19:19,029
you in X amount of time or this is

435
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:20,940
currently where it is in the process

436
00:19:19,029 --> 00:19:23,080
thank you for your patience again

437
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:25,359
thanking them for their patience goes a

438
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:27,759
long way if everyone is on the same page

439
00:19:25,359 --> 00:19:29,619
like hey this isn't easy just because

440
00:19:27,759 --> 00:19:31,719
you found a vulnerability in an hour

441
00:19:29,619 --> 00:19:34,059
doesn't mean it takes an hour to fix it

442
00:19:31,719 --> 00:19:37,899
could take a month it could take like a

443
00:19:34,059 --> 00:19:40,418
complete Ryoka texture new code based

444
00:19:37,899 --> 00:19:42,008
something so it's not always easy but if

445
00:19:40,419 --> 00:19:46,359
you communicate to them with that

446
00:19:42,009 --> 00:19:48,099
they'll be fine most cases it gets a

447
00:19:46,359 --> 00:19:49,989
little dicey when it gets to the point

448
00:19:48,099 --> 00:19:52,210
of like maybe a duplicate especially

449
00:19:49,989 --> 00:19:53,289
early on in the programs or like well

450
00:19:52,210 --> 00:19:55,539
you just launched how do I have a

451
00:19:53,289 --> 00:19:56,889
duplicate well the multiple people

452
00:19:55,539 --> 00:19:59,979
submit the same thing there's something

453
00:19:56,889 --> 00:20:02,019
very similar so managing those

454
00:19:59,979 --> 00:20:04,059
expectations and being very clear and

455
00:20:02,019 --> 00:20:06,460
upfront we've definitely had people who

456
00:20:04,059 --> 00:20:08,229
told us that's impossible there's no way

457
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:10,889
that's a duplicate your program started

458
00:20:08,229 --> 00:20:13,899
at this time and I hate you Oh awesome

459
00:20:10,889 --> 00:20:15,939
thank you

460
00:20:13,899 --> 00:20:17,379
through our programs no nobody did not

461
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:19,419
that's something you have to think about

462
00:20:17,379 --> 00:20:22,299
you know you will see duplicate reports

463
00:20:19,419 --> 00:20:24,549
do you award duplicates so that needs to

464
00:20:22,299 --> 00:20:26,289
be What's in scope at least for our

465
00:20:24,549 --> 00:20:28,210
program the way we kind of balance the

466
00:20:26,289 --> 00:20:30,249
duplicates other than trying to minimize

467
00:20:28,210 --> 00:20:34,690
them as much as possible by fixing

468
00:20:30,249 --> 00:20:36,669
quickly is the program the third party

469
00:20:34,690 --> 00:20:40,299
we use has a concept of both points and

470
00:20:36,669 --> 00:20:42,429
money and both have unique value points

471
00:20:40,299 --> 00:20:44,619
give them reputation within the platform

472
00:20:42,429 --> 00:20:47,249
lets them hop on to other private

473
00:20:44,619 --> 00:20:50,709
bounties which can lead to a future cash

474
00:20:47,249 --> 00:20:52,509
but so so for us for duplicates they

475
00:20:50,710 --> 00:20:53,799
give the points points only for

476
00:20:52,509 --> 00:20:55,320
duplicates so they feel like at least

477
00:20:53,799 --> 00:20:57,339
got something for the time they at least

478
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:59,950
still build their credit because they

479
00:20:57,339 --> 00:21:03,210
did find a legitimate issue it's just

480
00:20:59,950 --> 00:21:06,219
there's no longer any direct value to

481
00:21:03,210 --> 00:21:09,820
indeed to pay it out twice but at least

482
00:21:06,219 --> 00:21:11,859
we can kind of get find that middle

483
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:13,450
ground a little bit yeah there's the

484
00:21:11,859 --> 00:21:15,428
concept of points like through hacker

485
00:21:13,450 --> 00:21:17,080
one or buck Crowder other platforms are

486
00:21:15,429 --> 00:21:19,900
amazing it's a great way to bridge those

487
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:21,909
gaps also swag or even kudos

488
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:24,190
if you say hey thank you to so-and-so

489
00:21:21,910 --> 00:21:25,780
for this research they can use that to

490
00:21:24,190 --> 00:21:28,180
help build out their either the

491
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:30,100
reputation or even resumes we've we've

492
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:31,900
actually had those requests before and

493
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:35,649
it's really cool to be able to support

494
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:37,270
the community in that way to build on

495
00:21:35,650 --> 00:21:39,820
I'm gonna point to you eventually about

496
00:21:37,270 --> 00:21:41,470
the ailment it's you know how how do you

497
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:43,570
best engage with your researchers it's

498
00:21:41,470 --> 00:21:45,670
it's very customer service or what anted

499
00:21:43,570 --> 00:21:48,970
it's the standard things you would think

500
00:21:45,670 --> 00:21:50,680
of in any kind of homeless retail

501
00:21:48,970 --> 00:21:54,340
location you know setting expectations

502
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:55,840
by having a clear bounty scope and what

503
00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:59,070
you pay out for what you know but also

504
00:21:55,840 --> 00:22:01,480
when you when they give you a submission

505
00:21:59,070 --> 00:22:02,889
communicate with them like hey I think

506
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:05,040
your submission we're a little backed up

507
00:22:02,890 --> 00:22:07,750
right now we'll get to this next time is

508
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:09,700
one way to deal with if you've got too

509
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:13,210
many issues coming in or at least tell

510
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:15,220
them what what stage that submission is

511
00:22:13,210 --> 00:22:18,250
in is are you still trying to reproduce

512
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:19,300
or have you already reproduced now

513
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:22,270
you're just trying to figure out how to

514
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:24,879
fix it you know whatever place your

515
00:22:22,270 --> 00:22:28,330
ticket may be in communicate what the

516
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:30,130
research is is one of the the best ways

517
00:22:28,330 --> 00:22:31,720
to get them on your side to make sure

518
00:22:30,130 --> 00:22:33,100
that they're still willing to work with

519
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:35,230
you because you got to see it from their

520
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:36,939
perspective they spent you know however

521
00:22:35,230 --> 00:22:38,890
many hours to find a bug and they

522
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:40,090
submitted it to your program if they

523
00:22:38,890 --> 00:22:42,790
don't hear anything for a few weeks

524
00:22:40,090 --> 00:22:44,379
there they're like wow this is terrible

525
00:22:42,790 --> 00:22:47,020
they don't care about my issue even if

526
00:22:44,380 --> 00:22:48,160
you care very much and maybe actually

527
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:52,389
working on it the fact that you just

528
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:53,890
haven't spent the 15 seconds to put a

529
00:22:52,390 --> 00:22:56,140
quick comment that hey we're taking a

530
00:22:53,890 --> 00:23:00,850
look at this that can make all the world

531
00:22:56,140 --> 00:23:03,670
for the researcher I think read said it

532
00:23:00,850 --> 00:23:07,330
and he said it many times assume good

533
00:23:03,670 --> 00:23:09,700
intent most security researchers are

534
00:23:07,330 --> 00:23:11,710
coming to you because they want to work

535
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:14,500
with you if they wanted to do something

536
00:23:11,710 --> 00:23:16,090
else they'd do something else so they're

537
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:18,940
there because they want to work with you

538
00:23:16,090 --> 00:23:21,399
and assume that good intent but also

539
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:23,190
that clear communication the clear

540
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:26,010
acknowledgement

541
00:23:23,190 --> 00:23:28,500
the setting of expectations hey you know

542
00:23:26,010 --> 00:23:34,410
our cue right now is two weeks maybe

543
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:37,080
we're gonna pay in ten days maybe you

544
00:23:34,410 --> 00:23:40,110
know in our case we've sent this on to

545
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:42,030
the vendor we've heard back from the

546
00:23:40,110 --> 00:23:48,419
vendor and the vendor has you know ex

547
00:23:42,030 --> 00:23:51,030
question whatever it is but also a lot

548
00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:52,380
of researchers are you see mature

549
00:23:51,030 --> 00:23:57,810
researchers and you see quite young

550
00:23:52,380 --> 00:24:00,720
people too I I get a lot of hey I want

551
00:23:57,810 --> 00:24:03,270
my CBE yesterday right and I have to

552
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:05,460
explain you know the report has to be

553
00:24:03,270 --> 00:24:06,600
vetted the report has to be you know and

554
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:08,220
we work with the vendor and when the

555
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:10,530
vendor knows what the Patrick quick and

556
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:12,690
the CVE is assigned closer to the

557
00:24:10,530 --> 00:24:17,280
Advisory timeline so just taking the

558
00:24:12,690 --> 00:24:19,200
time to to help the person understand

559
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:21,120
the process there are a lot of really

560
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:23,400
talented young people out there who want

561
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:26,310
to work with you who may be new to the

562
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:28,500
process so even just taking the time to

563
00:24:26,310 --> 00:24:32,460
explain the process to them and what the

564
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:38,340
timelines might look like really goes

565
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:41,430
goes a tremendously long way so speaking

566
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:44,129
of CDs yesterday Shannon I know that

567
00:24:41,430 --> 00:24:46,980
you've worked through thousands of

568
00:24:44,130 --> 00:24:49,250
disclosures tell us a little bit about

569
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:51,570
that experience there's certainly a

570
00:24:49,250 --> 00:24:52,740
going public with the vulnerabilities

571
00:24:51,570 --> 00:24:54,720
that have been found in your platform

572
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:56,970
program your product can be kind of

573
00:24:54,720 --> 00:25:05,970
scary sometimes what's your experience

574
00:24:56,970 --> 00:25:07,920
there so that's oh well gosh that gets

575
00:25:05,970 --> 00:25:10,440
into so many things I don't know hump of

576
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:12,780
it struggling to know where to start

577
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:15,300
so at the zero day initiative because

578
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:19,590
we're a research organization but also

579
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:22,379
because we are a white hat organization

580
00:25:19,590 --> 00:25:25,220
we do consider our vendor partnerships

581
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:28,580
very valuable we come to the vendor and

582
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:33,260
say you have a hundred and twenty days

583
00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:37,850
to fix and at the end of that 120 days

584
00:25:33,260 --> 00:25:41,240
will disclose now zero day is is never

585
00:25:37,850 --> 00:25:44,270
ever my first choice my first choice is

586
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:46,220
to partner again assume good intent my

587
00:25:44,270 --> 00:25:49,129
first choice is to partner with the

588
00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:50,630
vendor to help them understand what's

589
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:53,750
wrong

590
00:25:50,630 --> 00:25:56,480
help them understand how they might fix

591
00:25:53,750 --> 00:25:59,539
it why you know why it's a vulnerability

592
00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:01,520
how they might fix it and then come to

593
00:25:59,539 --> 00:26:03,770
the point where we're doing coordinated

594
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:05,570
disclosure together and we're agreeing

595
00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:10,158
about what the Advisory should say

596
00:26:05,570 --> 00:26:12,860
that's always my goal but my experience

597
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:14,330
with vendors is incredibly diverse you

598
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:17,719
know I work with some very mature

599
00:26:14,330 --> 00:26:19,760
vendors Microsoft Adobe these are great

600
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:23,570
long-term partnerships that we have with

601
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:28,010
very mature piece certs and various tor

602
00:26:23,570 --> 00:26:30,049
sustaining processes and and you know so

603
00:26:28,010 --> 00:26:32,900
it's a very productive relationship and

604
00:26:30,049 --> 00:26:35,658
we don't come to O'Day that often

605
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:39,740
sometimes we plain disagree about the

606
00:26:35,659 --> 00:26:44,390
nature of a report but in general not

607
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:46,820
but then you do see many organizations

608
00:26:44,390 --> 00:26:50,780
who I don't want to say less mature but

609
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:54,620
maybe less less exposure to

610
00:26:50,780 --> 00:26:57,649
vulnerability disclosure process some

611
00:26:54,620 --> 00:26:58,340
SCADA organizations that's less familiar

612
00:26:57,650 --> 00:27:02,150
to them

613
00:26:58,340 --> 00:27:04,939
some of the new IOT vendors you know are

614
00:27:02,150 --> 00:27:08,330
are seeing vulnerability disclosures for

615
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:13,580
the first time so so some so you'd see a

616
00:27:08,330 --> 00:27:17,270
wide range of responses I do my very

617
00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:20,240
best to help vendors understand and this

618
00:27:17,270 --> 00:27:24,770
is where I think and I hope that I can

619
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:28,070
help vendors with their processes if if

620
00:27:24,770 --> 00:27:30,020
they want to talk about it but I do see

621
00:27:28,070 --> 00:27:31,639
such a wide range of vendor responses

622
00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:33,889
and I do try really hard to educate

623
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:37,279
vendors about what it can look like

624
00:27:33,890 --> 00:27:39,529
and why it's not so scary in terms of my

625
00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:42,590
education I come from a comms background

626
00:27:39,529 --> 00:27:45,769
so not professionally but in terms of my

627
00:27:42,590 --> 00:27:50,689
university education so you know how how

628
00:27:45,769 --> 00:27:52,429
you might respond to the OU day it's you

629
00:27:50,690 --> 00:27:55,580
know well we disagreed about the nature

630
00:27:52,429 --> 00:27:57,620
of the vulnerability because we we

631
00:27:55,580 --> 00:28:00,769
believe that the attack surface is quite

632
00:27:57,620 --> 00:28:02,779
narrow or and GDI makes it there is an

633
00:28:00,769 --> 00:28:04,880
attack surface but the bender may say

634
00:28:02,779 --> 00:28:08,740
it's quite narrow but don't be afraid to

635
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:11,179
say either this is why we disagree or

636
00:28:08,740 --> 00:28:14,149
this is how we're gonna mitigate and

637
00:28:11,179 --> 00:28:19,899
this is when we can do it and it doesn't

638
00:28:14,149 --> 00:28:23,899
have to be so scary or so threatening

639
00:28:19,899 --> 00:28:26,779
and good research and well intended

640
00:28:23,899 --> 00:28:28,340
persons and I think most are are going

641
00:28:26,779 --> 00:28:30,559
to be willing to have that conversation

642
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:32,720
with you and don't be afraid to pick up

643
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:35,809
the phone I think too often and software

644
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:37,370
we're too married to email and you know

645
00:28:35,809 --> 00:28:39,230
in software especially we're too married

646
00:28:37,370 --> 00:28:42,018
to email and we're having this whole

647
00:28:39,230 --> 00:28:44,389
conversation in an email hey can we get

648
00:28:42,019 --> 00:28:47,419
on the phone and talk about why we

649
00:28:44,389 --> 00:28:50,570
disagree or in my case you know I have

650
00:28:47,419 --> 00:28:53,120
to go and tell a finder that I disagreed

651
00:28:50,570 --> 00:28:55,428
with the vendor and I want to tell the

652
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:58,309
finder at a high level what you know

653
00:28:55,429 --> 00:29:03,529
what's gonna happen next but have those

654
00:28:58,309 --> 00:29:06,740
crucial conversations the one thing I

655
00:29:03,529 --> 00:29:09,440
might add to that so from the I guess

656
00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:12,529
from the indeed side and one thing we

657
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:13,880
try to keep in mind is that may you at

658
00:29:12,529 --> 00:29:15,950
the end of the day you can't prevent

659
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:18,019
them from publicly disclosing what they

660
00:29:15,950 --> 00:29:21,610
know because it's it's something they

661
00:29:18,019 --> 00:29:25,190
know they don't work for you technically

662
00:29:21,610 --> 00:29:26,840
but you there's a lot you can do prior

663
00:29:25,190 --> 00:29:29,169
to that to make sure that that

664
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:31,668
experience is good for both parties if

665
00:29:29,169 --> 00:29:34,519
researcher comes to us with a bug and we

666
00:29:31,669 --> 00:29:37,460
fix it quickly and then they you know

667
00:29:34,519 --> 00:29:39,700
blog about it indeed can come out of

668
00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:42,110
that looking good because you know we

669
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:43,200
quickly acknowledge the severity of the

670
00:29:42,110 --> 00:29:46,740
issue and fixed

671
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:49,110
and make sure that the researcher

672
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:52,139
understood that every step of the way so

673
00:29:49,110 --> 00:29:54,959
it can be a positive PR issue for a

674
00:29:52,139 --> 00:29:59,340
public disclosure the security research

675
00:29:54,960 --> 00:30:02,669
can definitely be a positive okay yeah I

676
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:05,070
was just gonna say that the kind of

677
00:30:02,669 --> 00:30:07,139
guidelines we tell our researchers is

678
00:30:05,070 --> 00:30:09,149
give us a chance to fix it and then you

679
00:30:07,139 --> 00:30:11,070
know let us at least you know fact check

680
00:30:09,149 --> 00:30:14,449
whatever blog post you want to push out

681
00:30:11,070 --> 00:30:17,820
or whatever and we're fine with that I

682
00:30:14,450 --> 00:30:20,070
think at least our program is a little

683
00:30:17,820 --> 00:30:22,710
different than yours in there's a lot of

684
00:30:20,070 --> 00:30:26,399
the people finding bugs in our platform

685
00:30:22,710 --> 00:30:29,370
I almost want to say they're not in it

686
00:30:26,399 --> 00:30:33,139
for the reputation necessarily at least

687
00:30:29,370 --> 00:30:36,139
not most of them in our experience but

688
00:30:33,139 --> 00:30:40,080
you can get all sorts either way

689
00:30:36,139 --> 00:30:42,719
actually I have a question I'm taking

690
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:44,820
over your role right so with that have

691
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:47,220
you found is it because of the breaching

692
00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:49,740
of SLA sometimes I mean unfortunately it

693
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:51,870
can happen or is it just this is the

694
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:57,120
nature of the bug and I want to talk

695
00:30:51,870 --> 00:30:58,830
about it regardless like in cases where

696
00:30:57,120 --> 00:31:00,209
we take too long to fix it and they want

697
00:30:58,830 --> 00:31:02,070
to disclose anyways what if you yeah

698
00:31:00,210 --> 00:31:04,409
what's the common reason why they prefer

699
00:31:02,070 --> 00:31:11,340
to talk about it publicly as opposed to

700
00:31:04,409 --> 00:31:15,809
keeping it to themselves so the basic

701
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:19,279
premise at least a money bounty is that

702
00:31:15,809 --> 00:31:22,080
you're kind of buying time in a sense

703
00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:24,529
you give them incentive to bring the

704
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:27,120
issues to you rather than trying to

705
00:31:24,529 --> 00:31:29,580
monetize in some other mechanism and you

706
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:31,110
can get pretty good value that way but

707
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:33,000
yeah if you're taking too long to even

708
00:31:31,110 --> 00:31:35,399
acknowledge and pay out their issue then

709
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:37,889
yeah they're going to try to find

710
00:31:35,399 --> 00:31:40,739
another route to to use their finding

711
00:31:37,889 --> 00:31:43,500
but if you're quick on at least

712
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:47,639
acknowledging the issue and and pain

713
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:48,960
even if that's prior to the fix we found

714
00:31:47,639 --> 00:31:50,429
the researchers give us a lot of

715
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:53,490
leniency

716
00:31:50,430 --> 00:31:55,230
and how long it may take if a particular

717
00:31:53,490 --> 00:31:58,890
issue is complicated to fix for example

718
00:31:55,230 --> 00:32:00,230
we've we've just not seen researchers

719
00:31:58,890 --> 00:32:03,420
wanting to publish

720
00:32:00,230 --> 00:32:05,280
severe issues prior to us fixing it so

721
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:07,559
far we hadn't lucky in that regard I

722
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:09,180
suppose so if any of you found that

723
00:32:07,559 --> 00:32:11,639
disclosure or the ability to go public

724
00:32:09,180 --> 00:32:13,730
is part of the incentive for the

725
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:15,780
researcher I know Microsoft even I think

726
00:32:13,730 --> 00:32:17,190
later this afternoon we've got multiple

727
00:32:15,780 --> 00:32:18,570
researchers that have participated gone

728
00:32:17,190 --> 00:32:20,100
through the bounty program received an

729
00:32:18,570 --> 00:32:22,110
award and are now onstage at black hat

730
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:24,540
or Def Con around the world sharing

731
00:32:22,110 --> 00:32:25,770
their findings that's a big thing for

732
00:32:24,540 --> 00:32:28,020
them have you had that similar

733
00:32:25,770 --> 00:32:30,960
experience was that part of your program

734
00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:33,510
I'm actually so when I was at the

735
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:36,300
airline we as a company not necessarily

736
00:32:33,510 --> 00:32:38,370
my personal opinions adverse to public

737
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:42,360
disclosure especially the timeframe that

738
00:32:38,370 --> 00:32:45,540
we launched the program it was a matter

739
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:48,510
of getting a lot of press really quickly

740
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:51,330
so we wanted to and again as the

741
00:32:48,510 --> 00:32:54,420
organization wanted to minimize that so

742
00:32:51,330 --> 00:32:57,300
the program didn't allow for public

743
00:32:54,420 --> 00:32:58,830
disclosure now in my personal opinion I

744
00:32:57,300 --> 00:33:01,440
think it's great I think it can't be

745
00:32:58,830 --> 00:33:05,220
great but with that industry there's a

746
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:08,100
lot of speculation too so it kind of

747
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:10,770
blurs those lines and it happens with

748
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:12,480
any other organization anyway so you're

749
00:33:10,770 --> 00:33:14,010
gonna have those blurred lines or this

750
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:17,760
is what I think this really means in

751
00:33:14,010 --> 00:33:19,559
reality the impact is a lot different so

752
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:22,050
we're trying to make sure we mitigate it

753
00:33:19,559 --> 00:33:23,879
that if I had my choice though at least

754
00:33:22,050 --> 00:33:26,190
kudos or something along those lines

755
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:29,490
makes a huge incentive for the

756
00:33:26,190 --> 00:33:31,890
researchers and finders when indeed or a

757
00:33:29,490 --> 00:33:34,500
big airline says thanks yeah it's

758
00:33:31,890 --> 00:33:36,540
exactly yeah there's been some really I

759
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:38,370
mean I wish there were the ones that

760
00:33:36,540 --> 00:33:40,678
definitely things like wow this is one

761
00:33:38,370 --> 00:33:45,389
of the most unique things that I've ever

762
00:33:40,679 --> 00:33:47,400
seen I wish you could talk about it but

763
00:33:45,390 --> 00:33:49,170
you know and that was just what legal

764
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:52,320
signed off on sometimes that's what

765
00:33:49,170 --> 00:33:54,750
we're beholdin to you kiddo to to return

766
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:58,080
the favor of got a question for you

767
00:33:54,750 --> 00:34:00,390
I don't know if that's still your your

768
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:04,520
stance but you said your program you

769
00:34:00,390 --> 00:34:07,289
know just this allows public disclosure

770
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:12,840
do you believe that's something you can

771
00:34:07,289 --> 00:34:15,389
enforce as best as possible so we would

772
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:17,879
basically we would use the the payout as

773
00:34:15,389 --> 00:34:19,770
kind of that mutual understanding like

774
00:34:17,879 --> 00:34:23,159
hey this is the way this was signed off

775
00:34:19,770 --> 00:34:24,480
on may be disclosed sorry that you could

776
00:34:23,159 --> 00:34:28,399
no longer it be a part of the program

777
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:31,320
and we won't lose my lauren bridges yeah

778
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:32,759
so that and it honestly that's not the

779
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:36,540
ideal way to approach it

780
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:39,030
really overall I know some organizations

781
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:42,989
a lot more closed held so I get that but

782
00:34:39,030 --> 00:34:44,520
it can and does leave a bad taste in the

783
00:34:42,989 --> 00:34:45,589
mouths of some of the people doing this

784
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:49,590
work

785
00:34:45,590 --> 00:34:54,419
so yeah the nature of it yeah

786
00:34:49,590 --> 00:34:56,700
and Shannon no comment when it finder

787
00:34:54,418 --> 00:34:59,220
accepts an award from zero day

788
00:34:56,699 --> 00:35:01,290
initiative he or she agrees to the

789
00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:05,868
researcher agreement which does grant

790
00:35:01,290 --> 00:35:09,690
CDI exclusivity to the report however

791
00:35:05,869 --> 00:35:11,130
post vendor patch when a finder has come

792
00:35:09,690 --> 00:35:15,839
and asked because we're a research

793
00:35:11,130 --> 00:35:18,750
organization ourselves in practice post

794
00:35:15,839 --> 00:35:20,910
patch when a researcher comes and says

795
00:35:18,750 --> 00:35:24,630
he or she would like to publish we've

796
00:35:20,910 --> 00:35:27,629
never actually declined and we do

797
00:35:24,630 --> 00:35:31,290
support that research post vendor patch

798
00:35:27,630 --> 00:35:37,080
and or post Oh Dave bender was given

799
00:35:31,290 --> 00:35:40,500
fair opportunity to do so I do and I'll

800
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:43,470
ask what you think my own sense after

801
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:45,510
many years it's sort of participating in

802
00:35:43,470 --> 00:35:47,279
the vulnerability and exploit economy I

803
00:35:45,510 --> 00:35:50,040
do think if you're looking for a

804
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:52,410
long-term non-disclosure you may have to

805
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:53,420
award a little bit more that's my

806
00:35:52,410 --> 00:35:56,549
opinion

807
00:35:53,420 --> 00:35:58,470
tell me what you think guys anybody have

808
00:35:56,550 --> 00:36:02,190
an opinion that makes sense

809
00:35:58,470 --> 00:36:05,430
if if you're so worried about losing

810
00:36:02,190 --> 00:36:07,760
future payouts and that's incentive to

811
00:36:05,430 --> 00:36:11,330
at least follow the rules in the program

812
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:14,280
definitely there were swag based

813
00:36:11,330 --> 00:36:16,440
programs it's a little bit like oh it's

814
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:18,180
a shirt okay whatever that's fine I'll

815
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:19,320
go talk about I don't need a shirt I

816
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:23,330
have plenty I go to conferences

817
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:27,210
something but then when there's lots of

818
00:36:23,330 --> 00:36:29,369
points or miles or cash Bitcoin whatever

819
00:36:27,210 --> 00:36:31,859
on the line and they're gonna be a

820
00:36:29,369 --> 00:36:36,060
little bit more amenable to even the

821
00:36:31,859 --> 00:36:40,500
more stricter rule sets good or bad

822
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:42,299
whatever just money seems to talk yeah

823
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:44,340
clearly there's some there difference of

824
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:45,840
opinion across industry in different

825
00:36:44,340 --> 00:36:47,340
ways of having this issues it's really

826
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:49,230
good to hear sort of three different

827
00:36:47,340 --> 00:36:51,000
perspectives on it most of how you've

828
00:36:49,230 --> 00:36:52,440
handled in the past and how you think my

829
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:54,810
brother what a best practice might look

830
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:57,720
like and then Shannon you mentioned the

831
00:36:54,810 --> 00:36:59,700
120-day disclosure SLA I know there's a

832
00:36:57,720 --> 00:37:01,080
lot of variance or not there's some

833
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:03,480
variance across the industry about

834
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:05,190
what's the right amount of time to to

835
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:07,710
ask for it how do you guys come across a

836
00:37:05,190 --> 00:37:10,619
brief you might guess how did 120 days

837
00:37:07,710 --> 00:37:15,000
come to be sort of your standard so you

838
00:37:10,619 --> 00:37:17,369
often see 90 days which is which is

839
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:20,760
indeed a pretty typical sustaining

840
00:37:17,369 --> 00:37:22,619
engineering cycle right and we've talked

841
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:29,599
about you know I'll say we've talked

842
00:37:22,619 --> 00:37:29,599
about 90 days for us how we came to 120

843
00:37:30,050 --> 00:37:34,020
what if you miss your flight right you

844
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:36,599
come in right at the end or right at the

845
00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:40,859
very beginning of a patch cycle so we

846
00:37:36,599 --> 00:37:42,930
have a very we're pretty close vendor

847
00:37:40,859 --> 00:37:45,450
working vendor relationships but in

848
00:37:42,930 --> 00:37:48,750
truth you know in my experience most

849
00:37:45,450 --> 00:37:53,700
vendors are patching a little closer to

850
00:37:48,750 --> 00:37:57,210
that 90 days than that 120 days and I I

851
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:59,910
certainly respect options in that range

852
00:37:57,210 --> 00:38:01,770
if you're coming if you are finder and

853
00:37:59,910 --> 00:38:04,920
you're coming to vendors with these

854
00:38:01,770 --> 00:38:08,040
really short timelines that's not that's

855
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:11,130
not always achievable and we talked it

856
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:13,100
earlier about many finders you know

857
00:38:11,130 --> 00:38:15,720
come from research they don't come from

858
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:20,430
from that software and they're less

859
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:22,049
familiar with the sustaining cycle this

860
00:38:20,430 --> 00:38:25,080
is something you really need to set

861
00:38:22,050 --> 00:38:28,110
expectations with your finders about so

862
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:30,509
they know what's reasonable in general

863
00:38:28,110 --> 00:38:33,150
and and what's reasonable for you in

864
00:38:30,510 --> 00:38:36,200
particular and again you know the more

865
00:38:33,150 --> 00:38:39,510
specific you could be with setting scope

866
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:42,960
and setting expectations the better so

867
00:38:39,510 --> 00:38:45,150
you know criticality X you know this is

868
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:46,410
probably going to be looking at a time

869
00:38:45,150 --> 00:38:48,900
frame and this range

870
00:38:46,410 --> 00:38:51,149
criticality Y we're looking at a time

871
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:53,670
frame in this range but the more you can

872
00:38:51,150 --> 00:38:56,370
set expectations I think the better your

873
00:38:53,670 --> 00:38:58,580
and their experience is going to be and

874
00:38:56,370 --> 00:39:01,230
the better your working relationship

875
00:38:58,580 --> 00:39:03,779
with the finder community is going to be

876
00:39:01,230 --> 00:39:05,670
so you mentioned scope you guys don't

877
00:39:03,780 --> 00:39:07,680
mind it's a perfect transition to the

878
00:39:05,670 --> 00:39:09,660
next topic which is scope now you guys

879
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:11,460
can't see the screen but on the back

880
00:39:09,660 --> 00:39:13,890
I've got a tweet from Ben who's not at

881
00:39:11,460 --> 00:39:17,100
Def Con Wow which has a picture of a

882
00:39:13,890 --> 00:39:19,830
staircase there's a well locked secured

883
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:21,900
gate with the box that says in scope and

884
00:39:19,830 --> 00:39:23,759
there's a really easily the climb of

885
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:27,870
alrea on the right this is out of scope

886
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:29,730
and this is that certainly a commentary

887
00:39:27,870 --> 00:39:31,259
complaint sometimes leverage that the

888
00:39:29,730 --> 00:39:33,000
battery industry in about setting scope

889
00:39:31,260 --> 00:39:34,110
so if you guys dealt with an issue like

890
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:36,750
this or what's your what's your

891
00:39:34,110 --> 00:39:41,280
perspective on this kind of poke at how

892
00:39:36,750 --> 00:39:44,210
how bounties at scope work go that's it

893
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:47,130
so I'm gonna put on my research

894
00:39:44,210 --> 00:39:50,760
organization hat you know the finder hat

895
00:39:47,130 --> 00:39:54,960
and say it is so helpful to us when a

896
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:57,660
vendor posts What's in scope what meets

897
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:59,610
the bar for security servicing for your

898
00:39:57,660 --> 00:40:01,710
organization how do you treat

899
00:39:59,610 --> 00:40:04,140
end-of-life products how do you treat

900
00:40:01,710 --> 00:40:06,840
extended support how long are you gonna

901
00:40:04,140 --> 00:40:09,060
service this thing that's so helpful to

902
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:11,880
us as a research organization and a lot

903
00:40:09,060 --> 00:40:14,940
of finders are chasing CBE's as resume

904
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:17,100
builders and reputation and they don't

905
00:40:14,940 --> 00:40:18,810
want to look at what's not in scope for

906
00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:21,190
you and then if they know what's in

907
00:40:18,810 --> 00:40:24,040
scope that's gonna eliminate some of the

908
00:40:21,190 --> 00:40:26,400
questions and some of that out of your

909
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:29,410
cues that you don't want to look at

910
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:30,700
please please be really clear about you

911
00:40:29,410 --> 00:40:35,290
know what's important to you what's in

912
00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:36,790
scope think in terms of you know what

913
00:40:35,290 --> 00:40:37,540
how long are we gonna service this

914
00:40:36,790 --> 00:40:40,060
product

915
00:40:37,540 --> 00:40:45,359
what does extended support mean what

916
00:40:40,060 --> 00:40:47,680
does end-of-life mean what meets the bar

917
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:50,049
what meets the bar for security

918
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:54,640
servicing for your organization share

919
00:40:50,050 --> 00:40:56,619
that with your finder community because

920
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:59,470
they're gonna come to you with what's

921
00:40:56,619 --> 00:41:02,349
important to you because they want

922
00:40:59,470 --> 00:41:03,790
credit for their work and if it's not

923
00:41:02,349 --> 00:41:06,550
important to you it's not in scope

924
00:41:03,790 --> 00:41:08,140
they're not gonna get that so you're

925
00:41:06,550 --> 00:41:09,790
gonna you're I really feel strongly

926
00:41:08,140 --> 00:41:12,430
you're gonna eliminate a lot of stuff

927
00:41:09,790 --> 00:41:16,810
out of your cues just by sharing that

928
00:41:12,430 --> 00:41:18,520
information your your program is

929
00:41:16,810 --> 00:41:21,160
definitely gonna live and die by the

930
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:24,460
scope first of all know what your

931
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:26,230
inventory is that's gonna save you you

932
00:41:24,460 --> 00:41:28,690
won't always have a hundred percent but

933
00:41:26,230 --> 00:41:31,660
getting a pretty close idea do the best

934
00:41:28,690 --> 00:41:34,680
you can and don't start off by throwing

935
00:41:31,660 --> 00:41:37,089
everything you have at it that's a huge

936
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:38,618
mistake unless you have a perfect

937
00:41:37,089 --> 00:41:40,990
program for your vulnerability

938
00:41:38,619 --> 00:41:44,109
management good for you I'd like to talk

939
00:41:40,990 --> 00:41:47,680
to you but start small slow and steady

940
00:41:44,109 --> 00:41:50,348
wins the race especially here if you

941
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:52,509
define your scope way too widely you're

942
00:41:50,349 --> 00:41:54,490
gonna be inundated and that's not a fun

943
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:58,180
thing to do you could always build out

944
00:41:54,490 --> 00:41:59,859
more you could change things you're

945
00:41:58,180 --> 00:42:02,109
allowed to it's I mean it's your program

946
00:41:59,859 --> 00:42:04,690
right so start off figure out what you

947
00:42:02,109 --> 00:42:06,910
want to have worked on and just go from

948
00:42:04,690 --> 00:42:08,710
there you're gonna any issue that you

949
00:42:06,910 --> 00:42:10,629
have in your process it's gonna be

950
00:42:08,710 --> 00:42:12,550
amplified if you have a terrible

951
00:42:10,630 --> 00:42:13,960
communication problem guess what that's

952
00:42:12,550 --> 00:42:15,490
not going to be great for the

953
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:18,880
researchers for the developers or for

954
00:42:15,490 --> 00:42:22,029
yourself if this one group does an

955
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:25,030
amazing job fixing everything that comes

956
00:42:22,030 --> 00:42:27,520
in before line but then you add team two

957
00:42:25,030 --> 00:42:29,079
or B or whatever and they're constantly

958
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:30,680
pushing up bugs and they're the one you

959
00:42:29,079 --> 00:42:33,500
put into the program you

960
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:34,910
gonna have a good day for that so just

961
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:38,420
understanding what you're getting into

962
00:42:34,910 --> 00:42:41,720
can make a big difference I would even

963
00:42:38,420 --> 00:42:43,040
say sorry but I would even say sometimes

964
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:44,270
when people talk about bug bounties

965
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:46,009
they're like well we don't know what's

966
00:42:44,270 --> 00:42:48,850
gonna come and sort of everything's in

967
00:42:46,010 --> 00:42:51,650
the scope that is crazy don't do that

968
00:42:48,850 --> 00:42:54,140
really because I I think you're gonna

969
00:42:51,650 --> 00:42:56,930
get a lot of you know crazy crafts I

970
00:42:54,140 --> 00:43:02,620
would look more like piloting you know

971
00:42:56,930 --> 00:43:05,870
targeted uh you know targeted award

972
00:43:02,620 --> 00:43:08,450
program this products in scope this type

973
00:43:05,870 --> 00:43:10,640
of bugs in scope this is the award range

974
00:43:08,450 --> 00:43:13,040
and starting with a subset of what you

975
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:14,990
ultimately want and not hey let's just

976
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:17,210
see what happens

977
00:43:14,990 --> 00:43:18,529
because you're gonna attract you know

978
00:43:17,210 --> 00:43:22,100
you're putting up an award you're gonna

979
00:43:18,530 --> 00:43:23,690
attract quite a lot potentially glad we

980
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:26,060
have a little bit of a almost a

981
00:43:23,690 --> 00:43:29,270
different experience a little bit and in

982
00:43:26,060 --> 00:43:31,220
scope we have there's a few kind of

983
00:43:29,270 --> 00:43:33,800
almost tenets or rules of thumb we try

984
00:43:31,220 --> 00:43:36,730
to follow to guide other actions one of

985
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:39,230
them being if if we make a change

986
00:43:36,730 --> 00:43:41,480
because of some submission then we

987
00:43:39,230 --> 00:43:44,870
should pay out for that and then

988
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:46,820
determine what's in scope or if

989
00:43:44,870 --> 00:43:48,740
something is about submission is is it

990
00:43:46,820 --> 00:43:51,530
reproducible is there a ballot attack

991
00:43:48,740 --> 00:43:54,399
scenario that can cause damage and is

992
00:43:51,530 --> 00:43:57,110
there something that we can do to fix it

993
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:59,060
but there are things that meet those

994
00:43:57,110 --> 00:44:01,580
rules of thumb that are outside of our

995
00:43:59,060 --> 00:44:03,470
explicit scope and then what do we do in

996
00:44:01,580 --> 00:44:06,920
those cases you know if we get a

997
00:44:03,470 --> 00:44:09,830
submission for a wordpress site that we

998
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:13,490
operate and the bug is in some WordPress

999
00:44:09,830 --> 00:44:16,940
plugin but there's a fix we can do to

1000
00:44:13,490 --> 00:44:19,129
mitigate right now you know WordPress is

1001
00:44:16,940 --> 00:44:20,420
technically not in scope but maybe we

1002
00:44:19,130 --> 00:44:22,640
should pay out on them and then that you

1003
00:44:20,420 --> 00:44:26,260
communicate that to the the finders the

1004
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:29,870
researchers so that's that's always a

1005
00:44:26,260 --> 00:44:33,140
difficult thing that we found our

1006
00:44:29,870 --> 00:44:35,270
current best effort way of

1007
00:44:33,140 --> 00:44:37,810
trying to describe that as we've

1008
00:44:35,270 --> 00:44:40,310
actually saw two bounties at this point

1009
00:44:37,810 --> 00:44:43,310
we've got our main bounty which is our

1010
00:44:40,310 --> 00:44:45,350
standard core products and things that

1011
00:44:43,310 --> 00:44:46,040
are fairly mature in the bust and we've

1012
00:44:45,350 --> 00:44:48,470
got a second

1013
00:44:46,040 --> 00:44:49,790
private bounty that's basically

1014
00:44:48,470 --> 00:44:52,189
everything else about me

1015
00:44:49,790 --> 00:44:54,950
it's got lower payout different

1016
00:44:52,190 --> 00:44:57,620
expectations but that's at least the way

1017
00:44:54,950 --> 00:44:59,750
we can we can treat different things

1018
00:44:57,620 --> 00:45:01,069
differently rather than just saying

1019
00:44:59,750 --> 00:45:04,400
everything's in scope for this main

1020
00:45:01,070 --> 00:45:06,650
pound bounty and dealing a you know ten

1021
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:11,380
thousand dollar payout for something

1022
00:45:06,650 --> 00:45:13,550
that may not have been that severe

1023
00:45:11,380 --> 00:45:15,350
setting expectations and then that

1024
00:45:13,550 --> 00:45:18,860
second bounding thing is at least work

1025
00:45:15,350 --> 00:45:20,330
better for us so far yeah you definitely

1026
00:45:18,860 --> 00:45:21,560
do not want to be the company that goes

1027
00:45:20,330 --> 00:45:23,720
and gets a submission that's out of

1028
00:45:21,560 --> 00:45:26,060
scope and then you say it's out of scope

1029
00:45:23,720 --> 00:45:28,970
or yeah definitely or ignoring it but

1030
00:45:26,060 --> 00:45:30,620
but if you fix it and it's still out of

1031
00:45:28,970 --> 00:45:33,049
scope and you say that you don't give

1032
00:45:30,620 --> 00:45:34,850
them anything that's not a good way to

1033
00:45:33,050 --> 00:45:36,680
have a relationship with the researchers

1034
00:45:34,850 --> 00:45:39,799
well you're saying if you touch it and

1035
00:45:36,680 --> 00:45:41,540
fix it it's not necessarily in scope

1036
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:44,540
right but it's something that you should

1037
00:45:41,540 --> 00:45:46,580
at least compensate for and make it very

1038
00:45:44,540 --> 00:45:48,740
clear to hey thank you this was an

1039
00:45:46,580 --> 00:45:50,720
awesome submission this was important to

1040
00:45:48,740 --> 00:45:53,779
us it's out of scope for the most part

1041
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:56,899
or out of scope but no for the most part

1042
00:45:53,780 --> 00:45:59,450
just send us info but this is just an

1043
00:45:56,900 --> 00:46:02,270
exception for now and then guide them

1044
00:45:59,450 --> 00:46:04,310
back to what your scope is they're not

1045
00:46:02,270 --> 00:46:06,230
always gonna do that but I think if

1046
00:46:04,310 --> 00:46:09,770
you're open and honest it'll make a big

1047
00:46:06,230 --> 00:46:11,690
difference yeah so we've got about five

1048
00:46:09,770 --> 00:46:15,500
minutes left of the panel so I want to

1049
00:46:11,690 --> 00:46:17,210
give you guys a chance to give us some

1050
00:46:15,500 --> 00:46:20,270
kind of key takeaways some sound bites

1051
00:46:17,210 --> 00:46:21,950
anything that like really strong message

1052
00:46:20,270 --> 00:46:23,330
do you want to make sure people walk out

1053
00:46:21,950 --> 00:46:24,620
of the room with today or something we

1054
00:46:23,330 --> 00:46:25,910
didn't get a chance to cover that you

1055
00:46:24,620 --> 00:46:27,710
kind of feel a strong feel strongly

1056
00:46:25,910 --> 00:46:30,470
about we'd like to share so when they

1057
00:46:27,710 --> 00:46:34,070
get each of you like a minute or two

1058
00:46:30,470 --> 00:46:38,879
just to kind of lay that out go ahead if

1059
00:46:34,070 --> 00:46:42,420
you start

1060
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:44,100
I would I would say we found we have

1061
00:46:42,420 --> 00:46:46,530
found a lot of value in our bug bounty

1062
00:46:44,100 --> 00:46:48,839
program and if you are considering one I

1063
00:46:46,530 --> 00:46:54,120
would strongly encourage you to do so

1064
00:46:48,840 --> 00:46:56,610
but start slowly but do start you can

1065
00:46:54,120 --> 00:46:59,850
start points only or even just like a

1066
00:46:56,610 --> 00:47:01,260
Hall of Fame on a page somewhere just so

1067
00:46:59,850 --> 00:47:03,799
you can get all the mechanics of your

1068
00:47:01,260 --> 00:47:07,620
bug bounty program worked out beforehand

1069
00:47:03,800 --> 00:47:09,180
and then as you've got your processes

1070
00:47:07,620 --> 00:47:10,410
mature than you you've got your

1071
00:47:09,180 --> 00:47:12,270
communication channels up with the

1072
00:47:10,410 --> 00:47:16,710
engineering teams you can start you know

1073
00:47:12,270 --> 00:47:20,070
cranking up the other perks or things to

1074
00:47:16,710 --> 00:47:23,670
attract researchers but start somewhere

1075
00:47:20,070 --> 00:47:27,930
but yeah definitely start slow yeah

1076
00:47:23,670 --> 00:47:29,190
start slow plan methodically you can

1077
00:47:27,930 --> 00:47:31,080
start to slow as you want but if you

1078
00:47:29,190 --> 00:47:32,400
have a really bad website or a bad app

1079
00:47:31,080 --> 00:47:34,799
you're gonna have a bad day no matter

1080
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:37,650
what regardless of scoping or anything

1081
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:38,550
you do I'm sorry so you know what you're

1082
00:47:37,650 --> 00:47:41,040
getting yourself into

1083
00:47:38,550 --> 00:47:42,510
pick that one site or application or

1084
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:45,810
whatever that you're working on that you

1085
00:47:42,510 --> 00:47:47,010
want in scope make it the good team that

1086
00:47:45,810 --> 00:47:49,500
team that's really mature

1087
00:47:47,010 --> 00:47:52,260
that's fixing the bugs has a really good

1088
00:47:49,500 --> 00:47:53,580
solid pipeline and work very very

1089
00:47:52,260 --> 00:47:56,160
closely with the engineers and

1090
00:47:53,580 --> 00:47:57,779
developers they're gonna be your friends

1091
00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:59,430
and if they're not they'll end up being

1092
00:47:57,780 --> 00:48:00,750
your enemies and that's the last group

1093
00:47:59,430 --> 00:48:02,910
of people that you want mad at you

1094
00:48:00,750 --> 00:48:05,040
especially in a bug bounty program let

1095
00:48:02,910 --> 00:48:08,670
alone real life in general insecurity

1096
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:10,710
but if you go you work with them and

1097
00:48:08,670 --> 00:48:12,510
everything is calm and stable awesome

1098
00:48:10,710 --> 00:48:14,310
did you do a pen test before you

1099
00:48:12,510 --> 00:48:17,070
launched did you do you actually have

1100
00:48:14,310 --> 00:48:19,710
clean scans coming back are you and I

1101
00:48:17,070 --> 00:48:22,260
hate using the terms but like shifting

1102
00:48:19,710 --> 00:48:24,510
left are you also making sure that their

1103
00:48:22,260 --> 00:48:27,690
process for the actual code code is

1104
00:48:24,510 --> 00:48:29,400
working pretty well one that's gonna

1105
00:48:27,690 --> 00:48:31,440
make your life easier in the program but

1106
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:33,510
also you want to bring out your best

1107
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:36,450
first off otherwise you're just gonna

1108
00:48:33,510 --> 00:48:38,850
have a lot of press a lot of bad times a

1109
00:48:36,450 --> 00:48:40,980
lot of people angry at you you angry at

1110
00:48:38,850 --> 00:48:41,910
yourself so do you definitely do

1111
00:48:40,980 --> 00:48:43,470
yourself a favor

1112
00:48:41,910 --> 00:48:47,220
slow and steady makes a huge difference

1113
00:48:43,470 --> 00:48:51,689
I think the only thing that I that I

1114
00:48:47,220 --> 00:48:52,709
didn't say already and again sort of

1115
00:48:51,690 --> 00:48:54,750
researcher hat person

1116
00:48:52,710 --> 00:48:57,300
spender hat but from a researcher

1117
00:48:54,750 --> 00:49:02,849
perspective what we take into our bug

1118
00:48:57,300 --> 00:49:05,339
bounty has taught us so much right and I

1119
00:49:02,849 --> 00:49:07,440
think as from a vendor perspective what

1120
00:49:05,339 --> 00:49:10,740
you take into your bug bounty will teach

1121
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:13,410
you so much about your products will

1122
00:49:10,740 --> 00:49:16,080
change how you test will change how you

1123
00:49:13,410 --> 00:49:19,290
look at your products as software you

1124
00:49:16,080 --> 00:49:21,509
know or we tend to look from a user

1125
00:49:19,290 --> 00:49:24,420
perspective what is what is that user

1126
00:49:21,510 --> 00:49:27,630
experience we don't look through the

1127
00:49:24,420 --> 00:49:30,180
attackers eyes and this I think will

1128
00:49:27,630 --> 00:49:31,859
change you tremendously in that way for

1129
00:49:30,180 --> 00:49:36,569
the for the better just to strengthen

1130
00:49:31,859 --> 00:49:38,160
your products our team is a better speed

1131
00:49:36,570 --> 00:49:40,200
because of our bug mani program we've

1132
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:41,549
learned so much from submissions we've

1133
00:49:40,200 --> 00:49:46,618
gotten through a book many program a

1134
00:49:41,550 --> 00:49:48,540
teacher incredible to hear let's see how

1135
00:49:46,619 --> 00:49:50,359
are we doing on time 5 min I can't quite

1136
00:49:48,540 --> 00:49:53,040
see that all right two minutes awesome

1137
00:49:50,359 --> 00:49:54,900
well thank you guys so much for for

1138
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:57,300
joining us we've heard a lot of

1139
00:49:54,900 --> 00:49:59,010
different perspectives from various

1140
00:49:57,300 --> 00:50:00,660
experiences launching multiple browning

1141
00:49:59,010 --> 00:50:03,119
programs running indeed spelling program

1142
00:50:00,660 --> 00:50:05,310
and then especially Shannon from sitting

1143
00:50:03,119 --> 00:50:07,560
outside vendors been working with many

1144
00:50:05,310 --> 00:50:11,460
many many many over many years it's

1145
00:50:07,560 --> 00:50:13,109
great to see kind of this you can still

1146
00:50:11,460 --> 00:50:15,030
there's still some best practices or at

1147
00:50:13,109 --> 00:50:17,460
least know what questions need ask going

1148
00:50:15,030 --> 00:50:19,200
in going forward in the future just at

1149
00:50:17,460 --> 00:50:20,580
the last minute what do you think are

1150
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:22,740
gonna be the biggest debates in this

1151
00:50:20,580 --> 00:50:24,109
industry or biggest issue in its hop on

1152
00:50:22,740 --> 00:50:26,819
its place we're going to see the most

1153
00:50:24,109 --> 00:50:28,900
varied solutions to the same problem or

1154
00:50:26,820 --> 00:50:31,690
question

1155
00:50:28,900 --> 00:50:35,559
[Applause]

1156
00:50:31,690 --> 00:50:36,940
I I think it being normalized is gonna

1157
00:50:35,559 --> 00:50:38,589
be the biggest thing that's know me

1158
00:50:36,940 --> 00:50:40,839
something here right yeah I still think

1159
00:50:38,589 --> 00:50:43,720
right now it's still kind of like a

1160
00:50:40,839 --> 00:50:45,549
niche community almost I mean we only

1161
00:50:43,720 --> 00:50:49,149
have a couple of platform or a handful

1162
00:50:45,549 --> 00:50:51,400
of platforms really and the risk adverse

1163
00:50:49,150 --> 00:50:53,109
nature of some of the fortune 100's but

1164
00:50:51,400 --> 00:50:54,970
as they start rolling out and seeing

1165
00:50:53,109 --> 00:50:58,690
that success I think that's gonna be the

1166
00:50:54,970 --> 00:51:00,430
big game changer is that the next couple

1167
00:50:58,690 --> 00:51:02,980
of years the next decade what do you

1168
00:51:00,430 --> 00:51:06,549
have to throw it out

1169
00:51:02,980 --> 00:51:07,900
I would say that probably closer to five

1170
00:51:06,549 --> 00:51:11,140
years I mean where it's been the last

1171
00:51:07,900 --> 00:51:13,990
five is pretty neat to see the there's

1172
00:51:11,140 --> 00:51:15,609
some brilliant things that people like

1173
00:51:13,990 --> 00:51:17,439
Kay de mistura's have talked about what

1174
00:51:15,609 --> 00:51:19,779
we need to do and change and adapt to

1175
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:22,480
make it a more holistic and inclusive

1176
00:51:19,780 --> 00:51:25,030
right now it's pretty pointed at certain

1177
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:28,000
groups of people who get high payouts

1178
00:51:25,030 --> 00:51:30,990
and I would it would be nice to see a

1179
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:34,000
larger community breadth and depth I

1180
00:51:30,990 --> 00:51:35,950
could definitely see the current crowd

1181
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:38,289
of researchers that are that's amazing

1182
00:51:35,950 --> 00:51:40,089
stuff the bug bounty programs becoming

1183
00:51:38,289 --> 00:51:42,549
more mature and becoming you know

1184
00:51:40,089 --> 00:51:43,990
experts in the field and that's that's

1185
00:51:42,549 --> 00:51:45,250
already I already see that with some of

1186
00:51:43,990 --> 00:51:47,020
our researchers that can work in our

1187
00:51:45,250 --> 00:51:48,880
band for a while but yeah another five

1188
00:51:47,020 --> 00:51:53,819
years they'd definitely be the leaders

1189
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:53,819
of the industry for sure and

1190
00:51:54,089 --> 00:51:58,119
collaboration don't be afraid to work

1191
00:51:56,289 --> 00:51:59,490
with others to improve the greater

1192
00:51:58,119 --> 00:52:04,569
ecosphere

1193
00:51:59,490 --> 00:52:06,129

1225
00:53:20,990 --> 00:53:25,580
