3
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:09,990
couple of brief notes you can stop by

4
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:12,420

two as well there's a merchandise store

9
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:21,869

recordings available for all the

11
00:00:21,869 --> 00:00:26,779
sessions for all the black hat there are

12
00:00:24,869 --> 00:00:29,490
offices on every level for that

13
00:00:26,779 --> 00:00:31,560
thanks for putting your cell phones on

14
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:33,120
vibrate it makes it easier for the rest

15
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:35,010
of us to ignore the text messages that

16
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:38,459
you're ignoring at the moment with that

17
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:50,218
I'd like to ask you to help me to invite

18
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:55,940
Philip to the stage get this thing

00:00:50,219 --> 00:00:55,940
hooked up here and get on our way

20
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:07,170
outstanding you just work what do you

21
00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:10,798
know afternoon folks thanks for coming I

22
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:14,700
really appreciate it on this or a second

23
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:15,960
to last slot of black hats I'll start

24
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:17,490
with the bad news first which is if

25
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:18,990
you're here with like bated breath

26
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:21,360
waiting to learn about the future of

27
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:24,119
authorities to operate you're in the

28
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:25,470
wrong room and that's not this is one of

29
00:01:24,119 --> 00:01:29,909
you even used that joke place at all

30
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:31,100
it's here in shmoo nowhere else so what

31
00:01:29,909 --> 00:01:33,540
we're gonna talk about is the future

32
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:38,240
from my perspective of account takeover

33
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:41,520
in in sort of consumer facing platforms

34
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:42,899
as coinbase with as the cryptocurrency

35
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:46,770
company and just a quick show of hands

36
00:01:42,899 --> 00:01:48,450
who here knows coinbase nice target

37
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:49,890
market right here in this room that's

38
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:52,860
outstanding

39
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:55,439
so the the scripted currency company we

40
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:59,430
see some of the most targeted high

41
00:01:55,439 --> 00:02:02,219
efforts motivated persistent ATO in the

42
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:03,450
world from my perspective over the past

43
00:02:02,219 --> 00:02:05,219
four three and a half years that I've

44
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:07,649
been at claim base I've started to see

45
00:02:05,219 --> 00:02:09,989
stuff that I first saw coming at us

46
00:02:07,649 --> 00:02:12,599
trickle down and make it to other parts

47
00:02:09,989 --> 00:02:13,530
of a broader industry which was really

48
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:16,560
the genesis for this

49
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:20,220
which was talking a bit about how we

50
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:22,080
day-to-day see account takeover how

51
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:24,330
we've sort of built to protect our

52
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:26,250
customers from it with the goal of

53
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:28,040
giving you guys a a view into the stuff

54
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:31,380
that might end up on your plate one day

55
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:33,690
and be some ideas about how we tackle

56
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:36,060
the challenge I make I make no bones

57
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:37,380
about you know we're not perfect I'm

58
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:39,540
sure there are things that we don't do

59
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:41,459
that we should and I'm sure there are

60
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:42,630
improvements that that's probably some

61
00:02:41,459 --> 00:02:47,580
of you guys in this room are gonna make

62
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:51,959
on a ways to detect and I counter

63
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:53,640
account takeovers but one of the provide

64
00:02:51,959 --> 00:02:55,260
sort of through our lens what we think

65
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:57,480
the future looks like

66
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:59,190
I'll start very briefly with me on this

67
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:01,290
is o at coinbase like I said about three

68
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:04,950
and a half years at going base which is

69
00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:08,190
something like 3,500 years in crypto

70
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:11,850
years recurrency years sorry for any of

71
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:12,959
you purists they all in the audience so

72
00:03:11,850 --> 00:03:15,060
you guys know coinbase by and large

73
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:16,230
drive brokerage Exchange custodian the

74
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:17,730
other way I sometimes like to refer to

75
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:21,750
coin base is the world's largest

76
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:25,200
capture-the-flag with nothing no that

77
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:27,450
guys wake up come on thank you thank you

78
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:29,000
so we've about 30 million users all

79
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:31,260
around the globe

80
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:34,380
literally almost at almost every country

81
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:35,220
in the world we're in 103 countries and

82
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:37,890
what that means is we have a very

83
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:39,480
diverse user population geographically

84
00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:42,238
diverse diverse in age diverse and

85
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:43,380
experienced which which makes some of

86
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:44,100
our up some of our messaging I'm gonna

87
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:46,109
talk a little bit about security

88
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:47,130
communication near the end which makes

89
00:03:46,109 --> 00:03:52,680
it particularly challenging and

90
00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:54,390
interesting so we're gonna start

91
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:58,230
structurally with throw an overview the

92
00:03:54,390 --> 00:04:00,600
8080 landscape we're gonna move protect

93
00:03:58,230 --> 00:04:02,760
me by technique into what what are we

94
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:03,840
seeing that's interesting what about it

95
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:05,160
is interesting right some of these

96
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:07,290
techniques up their credential stuffing

97
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:09,720
we all know credential stuffing talking

98
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:10,980
about sort of what we're doing to to

99
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:12,660
counter that and some of the interesting

100
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:15,619
twists we see attacker starting to bring

101
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:18,750
to the table given our countermeasures

102
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:21,720
I'm gonna leave five to ten minutes at

103
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:22,800
the end for questions so please please

104
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:24,750
save your questions for that there

105
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:26,200
there's two microphones and then the

106
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:27,580
aisles down the side

107
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:32,020
that will you guys if you guys have

108
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:33,909
questions and that's it so let's let's

109
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:35,680
let's learn a little bit about the

110
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:37,360
borough and ATO landscape first and then

111
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:41,350
we'll sort of dig into the the

112
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:42,820
individual pieces so we're gonna be

113
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:44,380
calling about talking about both what

114
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:47,920
Ike what I call what we call targeted

115
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:50,500
ATO and an untargeted ATO on our

116
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:53,440
platform we see about about 10% of the

117
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:56,140
ATO attempts that we see we judge as

118
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:57,730
targeted that's 10% leaving out the like

119
00:04:56,140 --> 00:04:59,080
50 billion credential stuffing in Tim

120
00:04:57,730 --> 00:05:03,610
stead of that have been made in the past

121
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:04,990
probably 32 seconds so so it over above

122
00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:07,240
that sort of floor level of noise about

123
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:08,950
10% for the remaining stuff we talk

124
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:11,440
about us targeted and so what is what

125
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:13,360
does that mean targeted ATO for us is

126
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:15,070
about the efforts and about the

127
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:17,200
persistence right it's it's high effort

128
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:19,330
high reward these attackers are

129
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:22,690
researching their their targets their

130
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:24,609
victims fairly in depth these attackers

131
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:26,050
are actively pivoting around right there

132
00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:27,640
they're not they don't let themselves be

133
00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:29,440
blocked and move on to a new target if

134
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:30,940
they if they encounter a blocker in

135
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:32,440
their attack they're gonna try to pivot

136
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:36,820
their way around it within within that

137
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:39,280
same target the the attackers wants

138
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:42,040
targeted attacks especially tend to

139
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:43,960
focus on on target centers of gravity

140
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:47,920
first email accounts are very very

141
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:49,659
popular we're starting to see to see you

142
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:52,210
know more and more all in file sharing

143
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:54,670
accounts being Dropbox at box things

144
00:05:52,210 --> 00:05:57,039
like that also being sort of regarded by

145
00:05:54,670 --> 00:05:58,300
these guys as centers of gravity they

146
00:05:57,040 --> 00:06:00,310
start there they get their toehold they

147
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:02,320
pivot around your target sort of online

148
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:03,490
life by the time they get to where

149
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:04,630
they're going to steal money whether

150
00:06:03,490 --> 00:06:07,120
that be point base or anywhere else

151
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:08,920
they're generally in possession of the

152
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:10,330
of the target's email their gentlemen

153
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:12,070
possession of if they have online

154
00:06:10,330 --> 00:06:13,690
file-sharing they're there in that

155
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:15,040
they're in the social media there's

156
00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:17,110
really a thorough fairly thorough

157
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:18,790
compromise that occurs before the

158
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:21,580
attacker moves on to actually their

159
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:22,830
their intended actions around mostly

160
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:27,490
around stealing with stealing money

161
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:29,289
right on three buddy Theo is the exact

162
00:06:27,490 --> 00:06:32,320
opposite right this is this is low to

163
00:06:29,290 --> 00:06:36,640
moderate efforts this is

164
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:39,159
you know low to no reward this is these

165
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:40,510
attackers have a little to no idea about

166
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:42,010
the identity of who they're attacking

167
00:06:40,510 --> 00:06:43,810
they don't leak air right there offering

168
00:06:42,010 --> 00:06:47,530
off of maybe a dump or some other list

169
00:06:43,810 --> 00:06:48,850
they scrape from somewhere they they if

170
00:06:47,530 --> 00:06:50,020
they encounter a roadblock if they run

171
00:06:48,850 --> 00:06:51,550
into something they weren't expecting I

172
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:52,780
just move on to the next name right they

173
00:06:51,550 --> 00:06:55,060
don't they don't really care they're not

174
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:56,799
tied to any one target and they're not

175
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:58,300
looking for a big payday they're there

176
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:01,480
they're the ones who are grinding this

177
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:06,160
out over over a large number of users

178
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:07,570
right so in general in our view here and

179
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:09,430
we'll talk through the specifics and the

180
00:07:07,570 --> 00:07:14,349
rest of the presentation but in general

181
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:17,200
our view is that is it to factor even

182
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:19,090
SMS to factor for for the vast majority

183
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:21,580
people is effective against untargeted

184
00:07:19,090 --> 00:07:22,479
ATO right there's some caveats in there

185
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:25,270
that I'll get into a little bit later

186
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:27,850
but in general versus untargeted ATO we

187
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:28,960
see SMS to FA and of course to UTP or

188
00:07:27,850 --> 00:07:31,390
you to F which we all would you're also

189
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:36,489
support as effective versus those two

190
00:07:31,390 --> 00:07:37,870
things right for for targeted ATO that

191
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:41,410
that is that is not the case and in fact

192
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:44,890
we see in targeted apos cases both SMS

193
00:07:41,410 --> 00:07:47,560
and totp we see attackers finding ways

194
00:07:44,890 --> 00:07:49,270
around over or through in various ways

195
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:50,770
and again what we'll get more into depth

196
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:54,969
in sort of the the the case-by-case

197
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:56,710
thing there for it's worth our results

198
00:07:54,970 --> 00:07:58,930
look exactly like Google's that u2f for

199
00:07:56,710 --> 00:08:02,289
web often survives across the board

200
00:07:58,930 --> 00:08:05,890
extremely well that is our

201
00:08:02,290 --> 00:08:07,090
recommendation for two FA and across the

202
00:08:05,890 --> 00:08:08,620
board is a very very very effective

203
00:08:07,090 --> 00:08:09,789
against everything but social

204
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:12,960
engineering which isn't really a

205
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:14,770
technical bias of that I guess

206
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:16,330
fortunately as I mentioned so the

207
00:08:14,770 --> 00:08:17,710
majority of people and even in

208
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:21,219
cryptocurrency the majority of people

209
00:08:17,710 --> 00:08:23,770
are not are not the victim of a targeted

210
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:25,360
ATL right there are obvious riches risk

211
00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:26,549
factors are you tweeting about your

212
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:28,750
cryptocurrency are you taking pictures

213
00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:30,940
standing next to a big Bitcoin symbol

214
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:34,840
are you engaged in public discourse and

215
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:37,599
cryptocurrency are you sort of creating

216
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:39,310
that trail that that oceans trail that

217
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:41,110
hacker behind and say oh this person

218
00:08:39,309 --> 00:08:42,770
probably has crypto I should target them

219
00:08:41,110 --> 00:08:44,480
for a high effort

220
00:08:42,770 --> 00:08:47,060
eighty oh right if you're doing that

221
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:49,760
then my argument would be you should be

222
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:51,170
using u2f if you're not if you're not

223
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:52,490
that easy to always send out and if

224
00:08:51,170 --> 00:08:55,310
you're not like leading upon a target

225
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:59,209
list SMS works works quite well at this

226
00:08:55,310 --> 00:09:00,829
point I am I am basically entirely

227
00:08:59,209 --> 00:09:05,000
positive that I will get questions about

228
00:09:00,830 --> 00:09:07,370
that topic at the end so feel free bring

229
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:10,339
that on now let's talk about sort of go

230
00:09:07,370 --> 00:09:11,930
from go from the the overall view like

231
00:09:10,339 --> 00:09:13,070
what house 8th you happening generally

232
00:09:11,930 --> 00:09:15,290
you talk about a little bit about sort

233
00:09:13,070 --> 00:09:15,950
of who is executing ATO and then we're

234
00:09:15,290 --> 00:09:17,270
gonna get into the media the

235
00:09:15,950 --> 00:09:20,000
presentation like how are they doing

236
00:09:17,270 --> 00:09:21,529
right so we see everything from solo

237
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,260
attackers all the way up to

238
00:09:21,529 --> 00:09:26,180
transnational criminal organizations and

239
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:27,800
even sums or smaller nation states North

240
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:30,099
Korea is a good example of a nations

241
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:32,510
data it's involved in the crypto space

242
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:34,070
these hackers in the space are generally

243
00:09:32,510 --> 00:09:35,930
economically rational they're not

244
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:37,640
ideological and they're not looking

245
00:09:35,930 --> 00:09:39,800
looking for things other than money I

246
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:41,899
can formation in there access which is

247
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:44,420
great because these attackers are

248
00:09:41,899 --> 00:09:45,649
looking to make a profit they formally

249
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:47,240
or informally they're looking at a

250
00:09:45,649 --> 00:09:49,160
profit and loss statement on their

251
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:50,660
activities right which from an

252
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:54,410
offender's perspective gives me a nice a

253
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:57,740
nice entry point to start to impact or

254
00:09:54,410 --> 00:09:59,750
or get inside their decision cycle most

255
00:09:57,740 --> 00:10:02,630
attacker groups that we see operating in

256
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:04,190
the space today are are one or two trick

257
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:06,140
ponies they they find a technique that

258
00:10:04,190 --> 00:10:07,459
works they work that technical it's not

259
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:10,420
working anymore they find a new one they

260
00:10:07,459 --> 00:10:12,920
go with that they're generally not

261
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:14,750
executing sort of a full spectrum of ATO

262
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:16,430
within a single group there are a few

263
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:19,700
exceptions to that but it but but in

264
00:10:16,430 --> 00:10:20,779
general and then I'll say with with the

265
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:23,390
heavy caveat that I mention at the end

266
00:10:20,779 --> 00:10:25,220
most of the groups that we're that we're

267
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:27,560
identifying tend to be located in places

268
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:29,510
like Nigeria Philippines

269
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:31,069
other places in Africa its men Eastern

270
00:10:29,510 --> 00:10:32,510
Europe relatively low-cost

271
00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:34,670
which again goes back to that that

272
00:10:32,510 --> 00:10:36,920
profit loss statement means that a

273
00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:39,349
relatively small to us payday

274
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:41,329
may be financing their operations for

275
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:43,010
actually quite a long time to come all

276
00:10:41,329 --> 00:10:46,000
right now I'll call this heavily which

277
00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:48,800
is the more accurate statement is that

278
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,300
probably attacker groups with poor OPSEC

279
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:52,010
tend to be located in lower-cost

280
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:52,880
countries right because those the ones

281
00:10:52,010 --> 00:10:54,709
were actually been able to do

282
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:55,630
attribution walk it back and actually

283
00:10:54,709 --> 00:11:01,630
get a good idea

284
00:10:55,630 --> 00:11:03,670
these folks are from so first up my my

285
00:11:01,630 --> 00:11:06,070
favorites the perennial swapping hambone

286
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:07,479
courting so I'll give I'll talk really

287
00:11:06,070 --> 00:11:08,710
really quickly about this at a high

288
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:11,740
level I'm not gonna go into detail on

289
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:13,270
like what each of these are but at a

290
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:14,590
high level right phone courting is the

291
00:11:13,270 --> 00:11:16,270
act of moving a phone number from from

292
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:18,070
company a to come from phone number from

293
00:11:16,270 --> 00:11:20,530
phone company a to phone company be

294
00:11:18,070 --> 00:11:23,080
right it's it's high effort it takes it

295
00:11:20,530 --> 00:11:26,339
takes a long time to to move it takes a

296
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:33,490
long time to move it back it's it's

297
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:35,620
relatively easy to detect because this

298
00:11:33,490 --> 00:11:37,290
porting information is is fairly easy to

299
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:40,150
access if you come on our data sources

300
00:11:37,290 --> 00:11:42,520
but it's also very hard to undo write

301
00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:44,170
average we've seen average porting on

302
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:45,760
new times in the in the weeks which is

303
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:48,939
really really painful if you're the

304
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:54,400
victim right sim swapping on the other

305
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:58,240
hand much much faster much much for

306
00:11:54,400 --> 00:12:00,160
lower bar both to do and to undo

307
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:02,170
symma swapping is keeping the phone

308
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:04,240
number within the same company within

309
00:12:02,170 --> 00:12:05,829
the same accounts but just attaching a

310
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:07,990
new sim to that phone number right it

311
00:12:05,830 --> 00:12:09,370
goes from the victim sim to the attacker

312
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:11,020
Sam and suddenly the attacker is getting

313
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:14,230
your SMS messages and receiving your

314
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:15,400
calls back at the beginning about 3

315
00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:16,930
years ago when I first started at

316
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:19,900
coinbase it was almost purely filling

317
00:12:16,930 --> 00:12:21,550
party that's what we saw which had it

318
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:23,800
has pluses and minuses for attackers

319
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:26,650
today we see almost exclusively sim

320
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:29,229
swapping phone porting is still happens

321
00:12:26,650 --> 00:12:30,579
but not nearly as frequently and I think

322
00:12:29,230 --> 00:12:32,980
one of the one of the reasons is because

323
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:35,350
we see attackers compressing their

324
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:39,250
attack timelines significantly so we see

325
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:43,210
today sim swaps Sims being swapped and

326
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:44,890
unlocked within 15 to 20 minutes these

327
00:12:43,210 --> 00:12:47,410
activities telling for when their victim

328
00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:50,020
is is likely a sleep based on their time

329
00:12:47,410 --> 00:12:51,069
zone right so so what happens right when

330
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:52,780
you get a sim swap or when you get a

331
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:54,520
phone port in general the first thing

332
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:55,720
you know is that your bars go to 0 and

333
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:56,740
you're like what happened you call the

334
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:57,850
phone company and it said oh yeah you

335
00:12:56,740 --> 00:13:00,600
moved your service and they say no I

336
00:12:57,850 --> 00:13:03,160
didn't and our argument starts right

337
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:04,720
with sim swapping because they can do it

338
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:06,760
very very quickly they can swap it it

339
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:09,370
swap it over do what they're gonna do

340
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:12,010
swap it back and you may not even know

341
00:13:09,370 --> 00:13:15,100
this occurred until the attacker is

342
00:13:12,010 --> 00:13:16,779
abusing the access they gain right so we

343
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:18,820
said you can't do that with no importing

344
00:13:16,779 --> 00:13:20,710
and bonus numbers just don't move that

345
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:22,180
quickly between companies which is why

346
00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:26,740
we think we see this concentration in

347
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:28,989
sim swapping in particular let's see so

348
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:30,600
let's let's simple thing is interesting

349
00:13:28,990 --> 00:13:34,680
because it's it's it's a fairly high

350
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:37,779
reward technique and is used frequently

351
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:40,620
both in 2fa bypasses but more and more

352
00:13:37,779 --> 00:13:42,520
we see it used in account recovery

353
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:45,610
bypasses we're going to talk about this

354
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:47,260
as a separate topic but but more and

355
00:13:45,610 --> 00:13:50,020
more we see that as the vector that some

356
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:51,550
swap is being used to gain access to

357
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:55,390
accounts through as opposed to straight

358
00:13:51,550 --> 00:13:57,520
sort of to pay to a big house doing now

359
00:13:55,390 --> 00:14:00,400
the reason this is is sort of high

360
00:13:57,520 --> 00:14:03,069
effort or high risk high reward is

361
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:05,819
because in order to execute that sim

362
00:14:03,070 --> 00:14:08,860
swap depending on you know which which

363
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:11,130
phone company is involved you're you're

364
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:13,720
doing one of you know social engineering

365
00:14:11,130 --> 00:14:16,780
you may be going to a physical store as

366
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:19,330
an attacker showing a fake ID or you may

367
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:21,670
be coerced seeing blackmailing bribing

368
00:14:19,330 --> 00:14:24,220
whatever a phone company employee into

369
00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:25,599
doing that activity for you what we've

370
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:28,510
seen of the past rock scene in the past

371
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:31,000
three years is a number of groups will

372
00:14:28,510 --> 00:14:33,010
start using this technique will will

373
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:35,050
ramp up activities do it enough so that

374
00:14:33,010 --> 00:14:37,420
the FBI gets interested yeah the IRS is

375
00:14:35,050 --> 00:14:39,339
the model sim swapping goes way down and

376
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:41,050
then another group that's interested sim

377
00:14:39,339 --> 00:14:43,600
something goes back up and this cycle is

378
00:14:41,050 --> 00:14:46,390
repeated at least three times these are

379
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:50,320
just a few of the different headlines on

380
00:14:46,390 --> 00:14:51,430
sort of the the the the various groups

381
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:54,250
that have been have been involved here

382
00:14:51,430 --> 00:14:55,750
over time so fortunately there's there's

383
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:58,030
actually quite quite a bit of stuff we

384
00:14:55,750 --> 00:15:00,550
can do to mitigate sim swapping and

385
00:14:58,030 --> 00:15:01,990
phone recording the number one thing we

386
00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:04,390
can do for this as I mentioned up front

387
00:15:01,990 --> 00:15:07,600
if you're if the user is a target for

388
00:15:04,390 --> 00:15:09,520
this right and again most users aren't

389
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:11,380
but if the user is a target for this the

390
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:14,079
best technique is to move off of SMS to

391
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:17,110
if a right move to tee up TV or you to

392
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:18,820
out for the preference in u2f is anyone

393
00:15:17,110 --> 00:15:22,060
who's run a large consumer site knows

394
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:22,630
this is incredibly hard to get users to

395
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:24,758
move for

396
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:26,980
up the value pyramid if you will for

397
00:15:24,759 --> 00:15:28,420
chipper to FA there's a couple things we

398
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:29,949
tried a bunch of stuff over there over

399
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:32,110
the course of time and I should I should

400
00:15:29,949 --> 00:15:33,160
preface this with we require coinbase is

401
00:15:32,110 --> 00:15:35,709
probably the largest platform I know

402
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:37,089
that requires 100% to assay every single

403
00:15:35,709 --> 00:15:38,380
account and coinbase has to if I you

404
00:15:37,089 --> 00:15:39,519
know haven't you don't get a choice we

405
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:41,139
don't we don't let you decide not to

406
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:43,360
have to FA we let you just like what

407
00:15:41,139 --> 00:15:45,250
kind of to a theta have right so our

408
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:46,660
challenge is not enrolling into a thiol

409
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:49,360
challenge is getting users to move up

410
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:52,420
into more secure to FA what we found is

411
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:54,279
the the we started with with emails and

412
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:56,740
said emailed users say hey upgrade you

413
00:15:54,279 --> 00:15:58,329
to FA we did a bunch of a be testing on

414
00:15:56,740 --> 00:16:00,610
like how to talk to users what message

415
00:15:58,329 --> 00:16:03,130
is it it's scary is it you're falling

416
00:16:00,610 --> 00:16:04,480
behind your peers is it your funds are

417
00:16:03,130 --> 00:16:08,110
at risk like how do we talk about and

418
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:10,449
then the best the very best conversion

419
00:16:08,110 --> 00:16:13,180
rate we got was about 3% from emails

420
00:16:10,449 --> 00:16:14,380
right it's atrocious that's terrible so

421
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:16,060
we said okay maybe even it's not gonna

422
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:19,180
work because you know there's a little

423
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:22,449
bit of that deliverability issues people

424
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:24,729
don't open emails whatever so let's

425
00:16:22,449 --> 00:16:25,540
let's do some in app work so we tried a

426
00:16:24,730 --> 00:16:27,339
couple different things we tried a

427
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:28,689
banner in the app that says hey please

428
00:16:27,339 --> 00:16:30,790
uh purgative a again we played with the

429
00:16:28,689 --> 00:16:32,349
wording we played with the urgency that

430
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:35,910
we got it up to about ten percent

431
00:16:32,350 --> 00:16:38,860
conversion which which is pretty solid

432
00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:40,930
but we wanted to get it better so so the

433
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:44,470
my recommendation if you're looking to

434
00:16:40,930 --> 00:16:48,699
get users to enroll in better to FA is

435
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:51,550
to annoy them so what we actually landed

436
00:16:48,699 --> 00:16:53,800
on here was once you once you cross a

437
00:16:51,550 --> 00:16:56,349
certain risk threshold as a coin base

438
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:58,300
user using SMS to FA every time you log

439
00:16:56,350 --> 00:17:01,449
into Queen base you were dropped into it

440
00:16:58,300 --> 00:17:03,189
into a to FA upgrade flow right and you

441
00:17:01,449 --> 00:17:05,020
can you can close it out you can skip it

442
00:17:03,189 --> 00:17:06,459
if you want you but every time you read

443
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:08,679
log you read log in every time you log

444
00:17:06,459 --> 00:17:10,870
in you see that same flow over it over

445
00:17:08,679 --> 00:17:13,600
and over and over until you one day out

446
00:17:10,869 --> 00:17:15,339
of sheer annoyance you just do it right

447
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:17,918
and that that has been incredibly

448
00:17:15,339 --> 00:17:21,158
effective getting people to move from

449
00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:26,230
SMS to TOTP and and over time into n2

450
00:17:21,159 --> 00:17:28,240
u2f right so the the second the second

451
00:17:26,230 --> 00:17:29,710
broad area is you know there there are

452
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:32,169
companies that they do have access to

453
00:17:29,710 --> 00:17:34,780
things like like phone porting feeds and

454
00:17:32,169 --> 00:17:36,070
sim swap feeds it's not a hundred

455
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:36,520
percent it's not panacea

456
00:17:36,070 --> 00:17:37,990
this is

457
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:39,400
like a feed you subscribe to you never

458
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:41,650
have a phone courting or some self event

459
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:43,570
again but it does help and it helps

460
00:17:41,650 --> 00:17:44,410
immensely this is the problem you guys

461
00:17:43,570 --> 00:17:46,179
are struggling with you want some

462
00:17:44,410 --> 00:17:47,440
recommendations come grab me after a

463
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:49,450
happy - happy to talk to you sort of

464
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:54,130
exactly what we use and and how we have

465
00:17:49,450 --> 00:17:58,000
we leverage it a bit more let's see

466
00:17:54,130 --> 00:17:59,290
what's the last thing lastly I and you

467
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,780
know this is a sort of echoing when I

468
00:17:59,290 --> 00:18:03,790
said before our firm belief is that any

469
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:05,620
to FA is better than no to FA right

470
00:18:03,790 --> 00:18:09,870
because we see the vast majority of

471
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:13,389
attacks in the space are things like

472
00:18:09,870 --> 00:18:14,649
credential stuffing or other untargeted

473
00:18:13,390 --> 00:18:17,800
attacks that are relatively low effort

474
00:18:14,650 --> 00:18:19,360
and SMS to FA is a is a mutt as enough

475
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:22,360
of a bump in the road and eBay all those

476
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:26,169
attacks right in a way that a pure

477
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:28,149
password wouldn't be right that said if

478
00:18:26,170 --> 00:18:29,530
it isn't you if that if that four

479
00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:31,930
important topping attack is in your

480
00:18:29,530 --> 00:18:34,570
threat model there is no panacea to

481
00:18:31,930 --> 00:18:37,200
prevent this either on our side of it as

482
00:18:34,570 --> 00:18:39,639
a platform or on the phone company aside

483
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:45,550
the only safe thing if your target is to

484
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:48,490
get off of off of SMS account recovery

485
00:18:45,550 --> 00:18:50,260
abuse so funny funny story about this

486
00:18:48,490 --> 00:18:53,050
about a slide I was I was looking for

487
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:54,100
for graphics to include here and I was

488
00:18:53,050 --> 00:18:55,780
like okay I'll just I'll just grab a

489
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:57,520
screenshot of like some platforms the

490
00:18:55,780 --> 00:18:58,510
kind of recovery flow and I was thinking

491
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:00,820
through that I'm like okay well which

492
00:18:58,510 --> 00:19:03,400
platform am I gonna call out in my black

493
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:04,929
hat talk on stage in Vegas and I said

494
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:06,280
you know what maybe the better idea is

495
00:19:04,930 --> 00:19:07,420
just to get a generic image of a book I

496
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:09,910
thought looking through a keyhole

497
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:11,050
that's probably the smarter move so you

498
00:19:09,910 --> 00:19:11,950
get the I button through a keyhole but

499
00:19:11,050 --> 00:19:16,330
it doesn't really make sense in this

500
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:18,610
context but that's fine so originally

501
00:19:16,330 --> 00:19:20,949
phone porting since Wapping was

502
00:19:18,610 --> 00:19:23,409
something that we saw used to bypass to

503
00:19:20,950 --> 00:19:25,150
it they directly right either you know

504
00:19:23,410 --> 00:19:27,820
the the the the common case was

505
00:19:25,150 --> 00:19:29,530
credential reuse attacker gets it tries

506
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:32,230
to log in because it to it gets to if a

507
00:19:29,530 --> 00:19:34,720
prompt you know goes into their PII

508
00:19:32,230 --> 00:19:37,510
archive for this user execute a port or

509
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:41,980
a swap you leverages that to get the

510
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:45,340
code walks in right today we see the

511
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:47,860
primary use of some sim shopping for

512
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:49,120
importing being used in account recovery

513
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:51,639
bypasses for three

514
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:53,399
party accounts email providers file

515
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:56,650
storage providers I kind of thing

516
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:58,930
because a lot of these platforms I think

517
00:19:56,650 --> 00:20:00,850
this is a this is a huge and

518
00:19:58,930 --> 00:20:03,220
underreported problem in the industry a

519
00:20:00,850 --> 00:20:04,750
lot of these platforms their account

520
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:06,850
recovery method basically devolves

521
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:08,200
Decimus right as long as you're gonna

522
00:20:06,850 --> 00:20:11,110
receive a text with your account

523
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:12,580
recovery code you can grain access back

524
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:14,559
to your account that account recovery

525
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:16,500
process resets both the password and the

526
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:19,690
to update at the same time right

527
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:21,370
effectively saying yes you you you set

528
00:20:19,690 --> 00:20:22,870
up your password and your your QF and

529
00:20:21,370 --> 00:20:24,610
you have these great practices and

530
00:20:22,870 --> 00:20:26,770
you're not reusing a password but

531
00:20:24,610 --> 00:20:29,709
because the account recovery depends on

532
00:20:26,770 --> 00:20:30,910
SMS a simple phone court or sim swap can

533
00:20:29,710 --> 00:20:38,440
result them not account compromised

534
00:20:30,910 --> 00:20:41,170
right it's it's it's sort of easy to

535
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:43,660
throw rocks at that right and say oh my

536
00:20:41,170 --> 00:20:45,370
gosh flip a table what in the world of

537
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:47,679
these platforms doing why are they using

538
00:20:45,370 --> 00:20:49,719
SMS it turns out this is actually like a

539
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:51,850
pretty hard problem like the core

540
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:53,080
problem here is how do we authenticate a

541
00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:55,600
user when they've forgotten the things

542
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:57,040
that we use to authenticate them right

543
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:59,740
which which when you start to dive down

544
00:20:57,040 --> 00:21:02,170
that rabbit hole and go into okay what

545
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:04,120
can we use what is a durable thing that

546
00:21:02,170 --> 00:21:06,820
we both know or that we both can access

547
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:09,699
that we can use to establish identity

548
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:10,928
right and that's that's it's pretty

549
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:14,410
tough right we went we've gone as an

550
00:21:10,929 --> 00:21:17,740
entry from from kba to you know SMS or

551
00:21:14,410 --> 00:21:19,510
recovery codes and like nothing's in my

552
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:20,710
opinion nothing's nothing's great I

553
00:21:19,510 --> 00:21:22,960
don't think we have a great solution

554
00:21:20,710 --> 00:21:24,220
either but but I will pitch sort of what

555
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:26,170
we do differently and what I would

556
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:28,809
recommend other folks think about we do

557
00:21:26,170 --> 00:21:30,460
three core things right number one we

558
00:21:28,809 --> 00:21:32,500
we're coinbase

559
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:34,450
has all the same know your customer

560
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:36,610
requirements as a bank right we have to

561
00:21:34,450 --> 00:21:39,580
get ID up front and all sorts of fun

562
00:21:36,610 --> 00:21:41,139
stuff so what we decided to do was

563
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:42,790
actually inject an additional idea

564
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:44,320
verification in the account recovery

565
00:21:42,790 --> 00:21:45,428
flow all right we ready have a copy of

566
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:48,040
it we got a copy when you when you're

567
00:21:45,429 --> 00:21:50,050
registered we push you back to that same

568
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:52,360
flow compare the ID use compare the

569
00:21:50,050 --> 00:21:54,370
selfies make sure that you this is

570
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:56,020
actually you make sure it's not a

571
00:21:54,370 --> 00:21:58,870
resubmission a few other corner cases

572
00:21:56,020 --> 00:22:00,790
I'm feeling that gives us and really we

573
00:21:58,870 --> 00:22:03,040
have the evidence to say that that is an

574
00:22:00,790 --> 00:22:04,930
enough of a roadblock at this point to

575
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:06,940
to cause attackers to go somewhere else

576
00:22:04,930 --> 00:22:09,240
and not try to push down that rabbit

577
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:12,880
hole now with with the proliferation of

578
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:16,540
kyc leaks with I think a really

579
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:19,120
interesting sort of problem with this is

580
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:21,190
gonna be deep fakes and and it depicts

581
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:24,010
ability to both by house aliveness

582
00:22:21,190 --> 00:22:26,620
detection on a lot of these or the KYC

583
00:22:24,010 --> 00:22:28,600
apps as well as you know generate this

584
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:31,870
stuff in a really believable effective

585
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:33,219
way so I don't think it's a because I

586
00:22:31,870 --> 00:22:34,750
don't think it's a panacea but it's if

587
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:36,520
the perk shirts worked extremely well

588
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:40,060
for us so far the second thing we do is

589
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:41,710
we separate out password recovery from

590
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:42,760
two of a reset those are two separate

591
00:22:41,710 --> 00:22:45,400
processes that have different

592
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:46,810
requirements right so that an attacker

593
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:48,430
has to go through both of those things

594
00:22:46,810 --> 00:22:50,440
to get full access they don't get one

595
00:22:48,430 --> 00:22:53,650
and done and reset all the protections

596
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:56,800
you had the third thing we do is we

597
00:22:53,650 --> 00:23:00,820
inject delays all right so so one of our

598
00:22:56,800 --> 00:23:02,740
defaults ways that we that we try to

599
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:04,600
mitigate events that there are high-risk

600
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:06,970
situations is we say okay we're going to

601
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:08,980
inject 48-hour cooling-off period

602
00:23:06,970 --> 00:23:11,050
and we're gonna message you on email

603
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:12,160
text everything we know about you were

604
00:23:11,050 --> 00:23:13,870
gonna send you a message and say like

605
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:15,970
hey we're delaying this for this reason

606
00:23:13,870 --> 00:23:17,500
if this wasn't you we're gonna give you

607
00:23:15,970 --> 00:23:18,940
a really easy way to say this wasn't me

608
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:21,640
and cancel whatever activity that was

609
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:23,260
whether it's like count reset or an

610
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:26,050
author unauthorized send when we do this

611
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:28,150
in a few different places this is a

612
00:23:26,050 --> 00:23:31,060
again in my opinion underused but a

613
00:23:28,150 --> 00:23:33,550
great control in general and makes even

614
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:34,270
targeted hackers have a really really

615
00:23:33,550 --> 00:23:35,230
hard time

616
00:23:34,270 --> 00:23:37,510
right because you're essentially saying

617
00:23:35,230 --> 00:23:40,540
okay I'd only have to do this once you

618
00:23:37,510 --> 00:23:42,730
not have to stay you have to stay in

619
00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:45,129
this person's account for 48 hours

620
00:23:42,730 --> 00:23:46,540
before you know you're actually getting

621
00:23:45,130 --> 00:23:48,220
what you want to do right which is more

622
00:23:46,540 --> 00:23:52,180
than most of most of them actually can

623
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:53,740
or want to do it's critical phishing

624
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:56,500
this is nothing new this has been around

625
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:59,380
since since forever a couple of

626
00:23:56,500 --> 00:24:02,860
interesting refinements that we see our

627
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:04,090
attackers using number one all of our

628
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:06,820
all the fish gets the target coinbase

629
00:24:04,090 --> 00:24:08,470
are integrated to FA phases as well so

630
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:12,220
taking username password they're asking

631
00:24:08,470 --> 00:24:13,360
for two if a token we require two of the

632
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:14,800
tokens for several in-app

633
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:19,060
actions as well things like sending

634
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:20,830
money or a few other things and so what

635
00:24:19,060 --> 00:24:22,330
we actually see is them integrating fake

636
00:24:20,830 --> 00:24:24,370
failures and their to have a collection

637
00:24:22,330 --> 00:24:25,810
as well I'll say gimme a new username

638
00:24:24,370 --> 00:24:27,399
password great give me or two of hit

639
00:24:25,810 --> 00:24:29,110
code that didn't what that one didn't

640
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:30,580
work try the next one right and we'll do

641
00:24:29,110 --> 00:24:32,379
that as many times as they need you to

642
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:34,870
collect the number of 2fa codes they

643
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:37,690
need to to perform actions on coinbase

644
00:24:34,870 --> 00:24:39,580
we also see them traditionally this kind

645
00:24:37,690 --> 00:24:41,710
of credential phishing the the creds

646
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:43,899
would go into a text file somewhere or

647
00:24:41,710 --> 00:24:46,660
into an email address that the attacker

648
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:49,630
would it would collect later right we

649
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:51,610
see them again modern fishing kits in

650
00:24:49,630 --> 00:24:52,720
real time using the credentials that

651
00:24:51,610 --> 00:24:55,479
they've harvested to reach out to

652
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:56,860
coinbase on the back end and do whatever

653
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:58,270
it is that they're trying to do so as

654
00:24:56,860 --> 00:25:00,699
you hit enter on that user name/password

655
00:24:58,270 --> 00:25:02,170
they're making an API call to coinbase

656
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:03,550
to say okay I'm already this thing as

657
00:25:02,170 --> 00:25:04,840
you can submit that to if they took when

658
00:25:03,550 --> 00:25:07,899
they're using it immediately on the back

659
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:09,820
end so the the DES cycle right is much

660
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:12,340
much shorter and much much harder for a

661
00:25:09,820 --> 00:25:16,899
user to take any action after after they

662
00:25:12,340 --> 00:25:20,709
lose their credentials so so what do we

663
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:22,180
do while we still see like a pretty

664
00:25:20,710 --> 00:25:25,150
decent volume of attempted crown jewel

665
00:25:22,180 --> 00:25:29,590
thefts we we see almost no success from

666
00:25:25,150 --> 00:25:32,470
the attackers the primary reason is we

667
00:25:29,590 --> 00:25:34,330
have a sarong screen shot we have a

668
00:25:32,470 --> 00:25:35,470
device verification flow so when you're

669
00:25:34,330 --> 00:25:38,139
logging from a new from a new device

670
00:25:35,470 --> 00:25:39,280
what we require is a email based

671
00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:40,480
workflow we send you we send you an

672
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:43,090
email we say hey there's the new device

673
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:46,270
we don't know it yet click here to say

674
00:25:43,090 --> 00:25:47,830
to say it's good the caveat and and the

675
00:25:46,270 --> 00:25:49,210
I think the thing that's actually more

676
00:25:47,830 --> 00:25:51,460
the more effective pieces of this is we

677
00:25:49,210 --> 00:25:53,490
require that click to come from the same

678
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:55,960
ip that the login attempt came from

679
00:25:53,490 --> 00:25:57,520
right so that if you're an attacker

680
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:59,590
right and you steal user name password

681
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:02,080
key OTP you're logging in from your IP

682
00:25:59,590 --> 00:26:04,780
you're not logging from users IP right

683
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:07,030
unless you can get bats that the mice

684
00:26:04,780 --> 00:26:08,889
verification link the credentials you

685
00:26:07,030 --> 00:26:12,190
have are basically useless at that point

686
00:26:08,890 --> 00:26:14,320
now we do see attackers trying to

687
00:26:12,190 --> 00:26:16,210
innovate around that right so so this is

688
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:17,740
a device this is this an official kit

689
00:26:16,210 --> 00:26:19,720
that includes a device verification by

690
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:20,710
us it's basically asking a user to

691
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:22,920
instead of clicking that link of the

692
00:26:20,710 --> 00:26:24,700
email copy and paste it into that form

693
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:26,620
for

694
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:30,100
you know reasons that they explain on

695
00:26:26,620 --> 00:26:32,620
the page this is this is a pretty high

696
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:33,939
bar for most users this is very very

697
00:26:32,620 --> 00:26:35,770
unsuccessful but what it does

698
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:38,170
demonstrate is is these attackers are

699
00:26:35,770 --> 00:26:39,879
incredibly creative and they're not

700
00:26:38,170 --> 00:26:41,860
sitting they're not they're not seeing

701
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:43,180
us make a move and they say well good

702
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:44,639
game coinbase we're going somewhere else

703
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:47,460
right they're looking at ways to

704
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:51,780
innovate around our innovations which is

705
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:56,500
both which is really really interesting

706
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:58,030
credential stuffing you all you all see

707
00:26:56,500 --> 00:27:00,520
this everyone on the internet sees this

708
00:26:58,030 --> 00:27:02,379
literally constantly right so nothing

709
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:04,270
nothing new and because we require to

710
00:27:02,380 --> 00:27:08,350
pay for all accounts it's basically

711
00:27:04,270 --> 00:27:09,879
useless on Queen base right so why are

712
00:27:08,350 --> 00:27:10,870
they doing it to me like why do I still

713
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:12,400
see credentials nothing runs it's

714
00:27:10,870 --> 00:27:13,929
actually real cost there right now it's

715
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:14,980
cost from the botnet there's there's

716
00:27:13,930 --> 00:27:18,520
opportunity costs they could be doing

717
00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:19,720
something else with that botnet written

718
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:21,520
we're tracking today somewhere around

719
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:23,590
half a dozen botnets that are there that

720
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:29,200
are fairly active coinbase screenful

721
00:27:23,590 --> 00:27:31,260
stoppers right so like why well we're

722
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:33,820
gonna that a little bit later

723
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:35,620
specifically though if you don't require

724
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:38,470
to UFA everywhere what we've seen here

725
00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:40,899
is their global they're everywhere

726
00:27:38,470 --> 00:27:42,580
they're in almost every country they're

727
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:45,310
extremely good or debating rate-limiting

728
00:27:42,580 --> 00:27:46,300
that's a that's a classical crucial

729
00:27:45,310 --> 00:27:48,159
stopping in countermeasure they're

730
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:49,990
extremely extremely good at detecting

731
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:55,570
and running right below the threshold

732
00:27:49,990 --> 00:27:57,010
for a rate limiting action right so so

733
00:27:55,570 --> 00:27:59,050
in fact one of the interesting things

734
00:27:57,010 --> 00:28:01,570
we've started to see on the botton that

735
00:27:59,050 --> 00:28:04,180
side is the proliferation of IOT devices

736
00:28:01,570 --> 00:28:07,120
in these botnets so we recently ID'd a

737
00:28:04,180 --> 00:28:09,010
toaster trying to log into coinbase and

738
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:10,030
you look I'm all for driving broad

739
00:28:09,010 --> 00:28:11,890
access to cryptocurrency

740
00:28:10,030 --> 00:28:13,899
like I want adoption to be as high as

741
00:28:11,890 --> 00:28:15,370
possible but I really worried that if we

742
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:17,380
gave toasters access to cryptocurrency

743
00:28:15,370 --> 00:28:19,270
we're just gonna start down sky we're

744
00:28:17,380 --> 00:28:21,970
gonna ended up with Skynet like tomorrow

745
00:28:19,270 --> 00:28:23,200
right so we did let them in toaster did

746
00:28:21,970 --> 00:28:24,790
not get cryptocurrency you're all

747
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:30,160
welcome we're gonna live a little bit

748
00:28:24,790 --> 00:28:33,540
longer so so how can you also help us

749
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:36,340
stave off the machine revolution right

750
00:28:33,540 --> 00:28:37,810
so rate-limiting does help great opening

751
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:41,050
does make those make them work harder

752
00:28:37,810 --> 00:28:43,899
it does make them slow down and it does

753
00:28:41,050 --> 00:28:46,000
make them use up more resources but if

754
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:47,950
an attacker cares enough about you they

755
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,780
can absolutely do it we see most of the

756
00:28:47,950 --> 00:28:51,670
botnets that are coming a claim base we

757
00:28:49,780 --> 00:28:54,760
see between three and four requests per

758
00:28:51,670 --> 00:28:56,680
IP total during the during the entire

759
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:57,910
run of the curricula stopping right so

760
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:59,440
from a rate limiting perspective a

761
00:28:57,910 --> 00:29:00,760
that's a pretty low bar and it's a

762
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:04,110
pretty like you're not gonna put a real

763
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:06,730
inning threshold at low more than likely

764
00:29:04,110 --> 00:29:08,260
similarly like a country level or ASN

765
00:29:06,730 --> 00:29:09,820
level blocking can be helpful sometimes

766
00:29:08,260 --> 00:29:12,820
it depends a lot on your platform and

767
00:29:09,820 --> 00:29:14,770
your York where your users are for us in

768
00:29:12,820 --> 00:29:16,179
103 countries it's it's a little bit

769
00:29:14,770 --> 00:29:18,610
harder than you got really effectively

770
00:29:16,180 --> 00:29:22,750
without impacting users in a way we just

771
00:29:18,610 --> 00:29:24,969
don't want to CAPTCHA is another common

772
00:29:22,750 --> 00:29:27,100
picture and for platforms that don't

773
00:29:24,970 --> 00:29:29,290
have an API they don't have to support

774
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:30,550
an API with login capabilities so if

775
00:29:29,290 --> 00:29:33,090
you're like if you're not supporting a

776
00:29:30,550 --> 00:29:35,770
mobile a native mobile app for example

777
00:29:33,090 --> 00:29:37,600
and don't have to deal with that captcha

778
00:29:35,770 --> 00:29:39,760
can actually be quite quite nice in this

779
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:41,169
in this context if you are if you are

780
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:43,510
supporting a native mobile app or our

781
00:29:41,170 --> 00:29:45,490
supporting flows that require an API

782
00:29:43,510 --> 00:29:48,010
based login it becomes much much harder

783
00:29:45,490 --> 00:29:49,390
to implement CAPTCHA reCAPTCHA and for

784
00:29:48,010 --> 00:29:50,740
all of the vendors who've an email me

785
00:29:49,390 --> 00:29:52,600
later about their amazing reCAPTCHA

786
00:29:50,740 --> 00:29:55,500
solutions please don't

787
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:55,500
that would be great

788
00:29:55,890 --> 00:30:02,560
let's see if they're also like probably

789
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:04,179
a hundred companies at this point it'll

790
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:06,550
sell you you know bot affection and bot

791
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:08,230
mitigation in various ways they're gonna

792
00:30:06,550 --> 00:30:09,940
work better or worse depending on the

793
00:30:08,230 --> 00:30:12,580
details of your platform and your and

794
00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:14,140
your like specific attackers I'm not

795
00:30:12,580 --> 00:30:15,879
gonna go into any of those if you want

796
00:30:14,140 --> 00:30:17,200
their the business hall write down the

797
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:22,030
they'll tell you all about all of that

798
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:23,440
stuff right ultimately qfa is the

799
00:30:22,030 --> 00:30:25,980
solution that works here that working

800
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:30,250
normally it works super super well right

801
00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:31,750
like I said we require to pay for every

802
00:30:30,250 --> 00:30:34,060
single user on coinbase so let's I'm

803
00:30:31,750 --> 00:30:35,050
gonna talk a little bit about that and

804
00:30:34,060 --> 00:30:37,120
sort of some of our some of the

805
00:30:35,050 --> 00:30:38,800
challenges that that creates and how

806
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:42,520
we're able to do it effectively but as I

807
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:44,139
hope I hope I hope that over time that

808
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:46,840
becomes more normalized I'm talk about

809
00:30:44,140 --> 00:30:48,580
this a little bit later but today if you

810
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:49,990
went and you know tried to log into a

811
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:51,460
site and they said you know what we

812
00:30:49,990 --> 00:30:52,840
actually don't have a password but

813
00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:54,669
we don't think that's act that's we

814
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:56,500
think of too much friction your most

815
00:30:54,669 --> 00:30:58,330
people's responsibie that's crazy what

816
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:59,799
are you doing right but that's

817
00:30:58,330 --> 00:31:01,570
essentially what a lot of platforms are

818
00:30:59,799 --> 00:31:02,860
saying about 2fa it's too much friction

819
00:31:01,570 --> 00:31:04,658
we don't want to push it on the user

820
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:05,770
they're not gonna use the service it's

821
00:31:04,659 --> 00:31:07,510
gonna impact the sales funnel or

822
00:31:05,770 --> 00:31:08,740
whatever it is and I think we have to

823
00:31:07,510 --> 00:31:11,919
get past that and do a place were

824
00:31:08,740 --> 00:31:13,450
normalizing to FA to say it's crazy not

825
00:31:11,919 --> 00:31:15,549
to it why aren't you it should be the

826
00:31:13,450 --> 00:31:18,010
question not like why are you making me

827
00:31:15,549 --> 00:31:19,779
do this but that's that's a big blue sky

828
00:31:18,010 --> 00:31:20,860
that's a lot of work to get there but I

829
00:31:19,779 --> 00:31:25,690
think it's where we have to get a long

830
00:31:20,860 --> 00:31:27,250
term like I said 30 million users global

831
00:31:25,690 --> 00:31:31,990
we have lots of interesting challenges

832
00:31:27,250 --> 00:31:34,000
with our user base like I said we

833
00:31:31,990 --> 00:31:35,230
defaults to SMS to fi so as you're

834
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,720
coming in and as you're registering with

835
00:31:35,230 --> 00:31:39,190
coinbase we ask for your phone number

836
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:43,419
it's both part of our kyc requirements

837
00:31:39,190 --> 00:31:47,830
and we Auto enroll you in in to effect

838
00:31:43,419 --> 00:31:49,600
right the challenges as I mentioned is

839
00:31:47,830 --> 00:31:51,490
is convincing users to move sort of up

840
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:53,168
up the ladder we talked about how we're

841
00:31:51,490 --> 00:31:56,140
doing how we're doing prompts about the

842
00:31:53,169 --> 00:31:59,140
in a prompt thing we've also we've also

843
00:31:56,140 --> 00:32:02,500
done a lot of work on sort of how we

844
00:31:59,140 --> 00:32:04,120
talk to users about about to FA both in

845
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:06,669
terms of like knowledge knowledge base

846
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:10,449
and help articles and tried to provide

847
00:32:06,669 --> 00:32:12,820
or really to the extent possible

848
00:32:10,450 --> 00:32:14,799
frictionless experience to user if

849
00:32:12,820 --> 00:32:16,658
you're using 2 of a right I think I

850
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:18,850
think a lot of users are sort of scared

851
00:32:16,659 --> 00:32:20,380
there are some cultural issues as well

852
00:32:18,850 --> 00:32:23,110
there's some technology issues across

853
00:32:20,380 --> 00:32:24,640
the board delivering to FA in Uganda is

854
00:32:23,110 --> 00:32:27,490
very different than delivering to FA in

855
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:29,470
New York right so there's a lot of

856
00:32:27,490 --> 00:32:37,590
regionality to this then you need to be

857
00:32:29,470 --> 00:32:39,700
explored if you're a global platform so

858
00:32:37,590 --> 00:32:41,168
if attackers aren't getting into

859
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:42,399
accounts right why are they crayons will

860
00:32:41,169 --> 00:32:45,429
stop I asked this earlier it's gonna

861
00:32:42,399 --> 00:32:46,809
talk about it and they're doing it

862
00:32:45,429 --> 00:32:49,000
because it's not actually credential

863
00:32:46,809 --> 00:32:52,658
stuffing its list validation right

864
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:54,850
they're reselling these lists in in ATO

865
00:32:52,659 --> 00:32:57,850
forums and other sort of dark market

866
00:32:54,850 --> 00:32:59,770
style of in use to other folks that are

867
00:32:57,850 --> 00:33:03,719
they're proud that are executing more

868
00:32:59,770 --> 00:33:03,720
targeted ATO tactics

869
00:33:04,220 --> 00:33:08,600
I don't want that right that's exactly

870
00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:10,250
what I don't want at one and what the

871
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:13,790
Hat happened in the world so we thought

872
00:33:10,250 --> 00:33:15,050
about this a lot we said okay I think we

873
00:33:13,790 --> 00:33:17,120
can we can build a system that starts to

874
00:33:15,050 --> 00:33:19,820
identify some of these ATR runs and we

875
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:22,100
do based on things like like water and

876
00:33:19,820 --> 00:33:22,730
hem velocity or some some user agent

877
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:24,620
stuff

878
00:33:22,730 --> 00:33:26,120
some header or discrepancies things like

879
00:33:24,620 --> 00:33:28,010
that or you can start to detect hey this

880
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:29,689
this is this is odd this is strange this

881
00:33:28,010 --> 00:33:32,180
is maybe a credential stuffing campaign

882
00:33:29,690 --> 00:33:35,240
and when we do that we feedback

883
00:33:32,180 --> 00:33:36,530
statistically probable lies right so we

884
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:38,240
took a look at sort of what the success

885
00:33:36,530 --> 00:33:41,000
rates were first critical stuffing runs

886
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:42,320
across the board by success I mean they

887
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,760
got a prompt that's they enter your to

888
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:46,939
FA right so what percentage of folks of

889
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:48,890
these passwords are actually good in in

890
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:51,200
our in the work we did for our site it

891
00:33:48,890 --> 00:33:54,080
was about 2.5 percent right came back is

892
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:57,380
like okay that's that's the right email

893
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:59,110
credential pair so again when we fly

894
00:33:57,380 --> 00:34:00,980
these and create create these sort of

895
00:33:59,110 --> 00:34:03,439
identifiers for these printer stuff in

896
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:05,270
campaigns we then track the responses to

897
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:07,460
that and we give them back about 2.5

898
00:34:05,270 --> 00:34:10,070
percent success all right completely

899
00:34:07,460 --> 00:34:14,270
randomly with with no basis in reality

900
00:34:10,070 --> 00:34:16,490
the intent of this beyond it you know

901
00:34:14,270 --> 00:34:18,739
makes us laugh and sort of fun is to

902
00:34:16,489 --> 00:34:20,689
impact their economic reputation right

903
00:34:18,739 --> 00:34:22,428
when they go resell that list somewhere

904
00:34:20,690 --> 00:34:24,230
else and say hey this is a validated

905
00:34:22,429 --> 00:34:28,850
coin base or Mesa Columbia sees your

906
00:34:24,230 --> 00:34:31,490
list you know that my my seller rating

907
00:34:28,850 --> 00:34:33,049
on whatever markets is gonna go down

908
00:34:31,489 --> 00:34:35,029
over time because you're reselling crap

909
00:34:33,050 --> 00:34:37,940
we've actually we've actually done the

910
00:34:35,030 --> 00:34:39,740
work to go like when we see ATO forum

911
00:34:37,940 --> 00:34:41,000
dumps OG users was a good example but

912
00:34:39,739 --> 00:34:42,080
there been a number of others where you

913
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,980
go probably through that and we look for

914
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:46,009
evidence this is actually being

915
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:48,710
successful right and we've seen we've

916
00:34:46,010 --> 00:34:50,360
seen seller reputation decline as they

917
00:34:48,710 --> 00:34:51,860
were selling junk lists that came from

918
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:53,750
this process which is awesome and

919
00:34:51,860 --> 00:34:56,330
exactly what we wanted to do right we

920
00:34:53,750 --> 00:34:59,140
were we wanted to dissuade folks from

921
00:34:56,330 --> 00:35:02,509
engaging in that behavior on coinbase

922
00:34:59,140 --> 00:35:04,430
now you might be asking yourself why are

923
00:35:02,510 --> 00:35:06,200
you saying this because now they know

924
00:35:04,430 --> 00:35:07,609
what you're doing it's been going on for

925
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:09,560
three years we've seen the we've seen

926
00:35:07,610 --> 00:35:11,540
their behavior change they they figured

927
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:13,910
it out right they have they have tripped

928
00:35:11,540 --> 00:35:15,170
to this at this point and there is

929
00:35:13,910 --> 00:35:17,299
there's a sort of a cat and mouse game

930
00:35:15,170 --> 00:35:20,480
we saw them doing things like

931
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:21,980
as they started to suspect doing doing

932
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:23,510
doing the cursory stuffing runs multiple

933
00:35:21,980 --> 00:35:24,830
times with the same with the same

934
00:35:23,510 --> 00:35:27,170
accounts looking for discrepancies in

935
00:35:24,830 --> 00:35:28,700
output including known good note known

936
00:35:27,170 --> 00:35:30,920
bad logins things like that try to

937
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:32,450
detect when we were spoofing them and

938
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:35,720
sort of we've gone back and forth over

939
00:35:32,450 --> 00:35:37,370
time into like you know addressing those

940
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:39,560
and they figure up new ones things like

941
00:35:37,370 --> 00:35:41,920
that so really the marginal the marginal

942
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:44,779
benefit has declined a fair bit for us

943
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:47,330
and so we'll do other things in the

944
00:35:44,780 --> 00:35:49,310
future not not this one we really wanted

945
00:35:47,330 --> 00:35:50,750
to open-source the tooling but when we

946
00:35:49,310 --> 00:35:53,180
when we went and looked and spent time

947
00:35:50,750 --> 00:35:55,340
it's so deeply embedded in our in our

948
00:35:53,180 --> 00:35:58,759
systems that pulling it out is almost

949
00:35:55,340 --> 00:36:00,470
meaningless to bring out in the world so

950
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:03,490
we'd love to we would love to do it at

951
00:36:00,470 --> 00:36:03,490
some point hopefully we will

952
00:36:05,390 --> 00:36:11,900
let's talk social engineering and I

953
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:15,920
think I'm right about on time here yep

954
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:20,780
perfect this is the most common account

955
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:22,760
takeover technique we see black it's low

956
00:36:20,780 --> 00:36:24,710
tech it's low risk you can do it

957
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:27,680
remotely it's fairly easy to do it works

958
00:36:24,710 --> 00:36:31,400
depressingly well on a broad swath of

959
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:32,870
people so we used to see the classical

960
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:34,910
sort of tech support scott stiles games

961
00:36:32,870 --> 00:36:36,440
the cold trolling scams where there's a

962
00:36:34,910 --> 00:36:37,970
call center somewhere they're calling

963
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:39,590
you they're calling almost literally

964
00:36:37,970 --> 00:36:41,060
random numbers and saying hey I'm

965
00:36:39,590 --> 00:36:43,850
calling from coinbase about your problem

966
00:36:41,060 --> 00:36:45,560
you have a problem right and if you say

967
00:36:43,850 --> 00:36:47,029
no and I'm a problem they'll say oh I'm

968
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:48,950
also Amazon support I'm calling about

969
00:36:47,030 --> 00:36:51,170
you have a problem there and they'll

970
00:36:48,950 --> 00:36:52,370
just literally have listen to recorded

971
00:36:51,170 --> 00:36:54,530
conversations where we have a view

972
00:36:52,370 --> 00:36:56,630
between four or five different brands as

973
00:36:54,530 --> 00:36:57,530
someone said I don't have a problem I

974
00:36:56,630 --> 00:36:59,060
don't have a problem yeah I got a

975
00:36:57,530 --> 00:37:03,680
problem there can you help me with that

976
00:36:59,060 --> 00:37:05,509
one so we don't see those as much

977
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:07,910
anymore and the cryptocurrencies side

978
00:37:05,510 --> 00:37:09,710
right I think for a couple of reasons

979
00:37:07,910 --> 00:37:11,899
number one the FTC has been very very

980
00:37:09,710 --> 00:37:13,700
aggressive in shutting down these call

981
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:15,400
centers and and actually creating real

982
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:19,279
consequences that's that's been great

983
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:22,100
but also it's it's a it's a it's a it's

984
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:24,170
a grind it's a low success percentage

985
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:25,790
because you're cold calling right if any

986
00:37:24,170 --> 00:37:28,220
of you I've ever worked in marketing or

987
00:37:25,790 --> 00:37:29,930
thought about marketing effectively the

988
00:37:28,220 --> 00:37:30,439
the worst thing you can do is cold

989
00:37:29,930 --> 00:37:32,480
outreach

990
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:34,549
right you just get hang-ups all day long

991
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:37,130
very frustrating low return on

992
00:37:34,549 --> 00:37:40,630
investment not great so what we started

993
00:37:37,130 --> 00:37:43,520
to see attackers do is try to bring

994
00:37:40,630 --> 00:37:45,710
victims to them rather than them knowing

995
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:47,780
to the victim right so the first

996
00:37:45,710 --> 00:37:50,240
experiments we saw attackers do here was

997
00:37:47,780 --> 00:37:53,210
around social engineering and public

998
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:54,828
knowledge bases sorry not social

999
00:37:53,210 --> 00:37:56,119
engineering with social media and public

1000
00:37:54,829 --> 00:37:59,180
knowledge bases right using Twitter

1001
00:37:56,119 --> 00:38:02,329
using Facebook to put out fake phone

1002
00:37:59,180 --> 00:38:04,279
support scam numbers or other other sort

1003
00:38:02,329 --> 00:38:05,930
of social engineering related stuff to

1004
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:07,250
say hey if you got a problem this is the

1005
00:38:05,930 --> 00:38:08,538
official coin based support number or

1006
00:38:07,250 --> 00:38:10,250
the official Gemini's support number the

1007
00:38:08,539 --> 00:38:12,920
official crack and support number or

1008
00:38:10,250 --> 00:38:15,289
whatever right the knowledge base is

1009
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:17,750
they were using to do to do SEO

1010
00:38:15,289 --> 00:38:20,150
basically so they would find a knowledge

1011
00:38:17,750 --> 00:38:21,770
base that's on a popular site that's

1012
00:38:20,150 --> 00:38:23,839
open right so though so these are these

1013
00:38:21,770 --> 00:38:25,579
are things where people or companies are

1014
00:38:23,839 --> 00:38:27,078
allowing users to support each other by

1015
00:38:25,579 --> 00:38:28,940
creating content in their in their

1016
00:38:27,079 --> 00:38:30,770
knowledge base and instead of supporting

1017
00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:32,780
other each other they would create pages

1018
00:38:30,770 --> 00:38:35,299
on these knowledge bases to say that the

1019
00:38:32,780 --> 00:38:36,589
official support number for Brand X is

1020
00:38:35,299 --> 00:38:38,000
this and you saw it not just a

1021
00:38:36,589 --> 00:38:42,410
cryptocurrency but across the board

1022
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:46,730
almost every major brand and that that

1023
00:38:42,410 --> 00:38:48,348
works better quite frankly that not what

1024
00:38:46,730 --> 00:38:50,539
that means is that instead of cold

1025
00:38:48,349 --> 00:38:53,930
calling users who may or may not be

1026
00:38:50,539 --> 00:38:55,549
clean base users or user of any one

1027
00:38:53,930 --> 00:38:57,950
brand what they're doing is they're

1028
00:38:55,549 --> 00:39:00,288
creating a funnel to bring users to them

1029
00:38:57,950 --> 00:39:01,970
who are who they know are already

1030
00:39:00,289 --> 00:39:03,079
customers of that brand because why else

1031
00:39:01,970 --> 00:39:05,149
would they be out there searching for

1032
00:39:03,079 --> 00:39:06,740
this information and who probably have

1033
00:39:05,150 --> 00:39:09,230
some sort of problem they need addressed

1034
00:39:06,740 --> 00:39:11,450
right from a marketing perspective this

1035
00:39:09,230 --> 00:39:15,240
is a much better flow

1036
00:39:11,450 --> 00:39:21,750
potential leads than cold calling out to

1037
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:23,368
a bunch of random people they've so so

1038
00:39:21,750 --> 00:39:25,410
once the user actually is in contact

1039
00:39:23,369 --> 00:39:27,030
with social engineer there are different

1040
00:39:25,410 --> 00:39:29,040
flavors of this but like the basic

1041
00:39:27,030 --> 00:39:31,380
process boils down to install this

1042
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:33,390
screen sharing application login to the

1043
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:35,730
targeted brand take control the screen

1044
00:39:33,390 --> 00:39:38,250
perform the malicious action and done

1045
00:39:35,730 --> 00:39:40,950
right it's really really straightforward

1046
00:39:38,250 --> 00:39:42,900
flow you get like after you bring the

1047
00:39:40,950 --> 00:39:43,980
user to you I'm gonna talk a little bit

1048
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:48,720
later about a few of the other methods

1049
00:39:43,980 --> 00:39:50,400
we see we see attackers using to to

1050
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:51,890
bring victims to and in fact all its

1051
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:54,180
commend do that right now

1052
00:39:51,890 --> 00:39:56,190
so two things we've seen attackers

1053
00:39:54,180 --> 00:39:57,990
playing with it's really really

1054
00:39:56,190 --> 00:40:00,150
interesting one is answer mocks

1055
00:39:57,990 --> 00:40:02,399
pollution so the answer box the

1056
00:40:00,150 --> 00:40:03,450
screenshot up there for Google but most

1057
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:06,750
of the searchers have a some have a

1058
00:40:03,450 --> 00:40:08,279
similar feature right we've started we

1059
00:40:06,750 --> 00:40:09,869
have seen over time attackers

1060
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:11,839
experimenting with creating pages like

1061
00:40:09,869 --> 00:40:16,049
like on the on the upper right up there

1062
00:40:11,839 --> 00:40:18,328
which is a totally benign non Moses page

1063
00:40:16,049 --> 00:40:20,069
copy lifted directly from the climate's

1064
00:40:18,329 --> 00:40:22,619
websites or from the Wikipedia article

1065
00:40:20,069 --> 00:40:24,720
on coinbase the only thing about that

1066
00:40:22,619 --> 00:40:27,569
page is different is the phone number is

1067
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:29,430
different or was different before the

1068
00:40:27,569 --> 00:40:31,349
phone number went to a scam call center

1069
00:40:29,430 --> 00:40:34,259
is the only thing that's different about

1070
00:40:31,349 --> 00:40:36,150
that page and we've seen attackers try

1071
00:40:34,260 --> 00:40:38,309
to inject these more and more because

1072
00:40:36,150 --> 00:40:40,849
the answer box solutions are generally

1073
00:40:38,309 --> 00:40:44,430
looking for exactly that well formatted

1074
00:40:40,849 --> 00:40:46,109
seemingly authoritative sources to sort

1075
00:40:44,430 --> 00:40:48,808
of compute what's the right answer right

1076
00:40:46,109 --> 00:40:50,308
I think I think this this the the one

1077
00:40:48,809 --> 00:40:51,839
below it the maps locations is also

1078
00:40:50,309 --> 00:40:53,369
interesting we see it again that's a

1079
00:40:51,839 --> 00:40:55,069
google screenshot but we see it across

1080
00:40:53,369 --> 00:40:56,880
any basically all the maps functions

1081
00:40:55,069 --> 00:40:58,589
what's nice about this is when you

1082
00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:00,869
search on Google or Yahoo or wherever

1083
00:40:58,589 --> 00:41:01,799
and the search engine thinks they it

1084
00:41:00,869 --> 00:41:04,440
knows where you are

1085
00:41:01,799 --> 00:41:05,609
it'll pop up location only contextually

1086
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:08,460
relevant locations that might answer

1087
00:41:05,609 --> 00:41:09,960
your search right great what the

1088
00:41:08,460 --> 00:41:12,540
attackers did is they created a bunch of

1089
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:15,750
fake locations for coin a fake coin base

1090
00:41:12,540 --> 00:41:18,960
offices and the map the populated with

1091
00:41:15,750 --> 00:41:21,119
again scam phone numbers right so that

1092
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:22,319
when you search that pops up sort of

1093
00:41:21,119 --> 00:41:23,760
three quarters of the way up the screen

1094
00:41:22,319 --> 00:41:24,490
right you get like the ads on the top

1095
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:26,740
you

1096
00:41:24,490 --> 00:41:28,569
like three real results you get the maps

1097
00:41:26,740 --> 00:41:32,859
right there right front and center right

1098
00:41:28,570 --> 00:41:34,360
um that's when I saw that I had to give

1099
00:41:32,860 --> 00:41:38,080
the attackers from a golfclap like that

1100
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:41,710
was a great idea and for for a defender

1101
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:42,670
it's it's harder to detect because these

1102
00:41:41,710 --> 00:41:44,530
searchers only come up when they

1103
00:41:42,670 --> 00:41:46,750
locationally relevant all right so we

1104
00:41:44,530 --> 00:41:48,520
actually wrote a bunch of search

1105
00:41:46,750 --> 00:41:50,290
scraping stuff at spoof locations so we

1106
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:51,400
could transport ourselves around the

1107
00:41:50,290 --> 00:41:54,490
world and start and search for these

1108
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:58,840
things and start to take them down but

1109
00:41:54,490 --> 00:42:01,779
the theme for these two things is even

1110
00:41:58,840 --> 00:42:03,700
more so than we talked about the Twitter

1111
00:42:01,780 --> 00:42:05,080
or the knowledge bases is these

1112
00:42:03,700 --> 00:42:06,790
attackers are looking to poison the

1113
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:09,670
information that users are using to make

1114
00:42:06,790 --> 00:42:13,090
decisions right it's they've gone from

1115
00:42:09,670 --> 00:42:15,130
cold calling to posting targeted ads

1116
00:42:13,090 --> 00:42:17,350
basically whether it's social media or

1117
00:42:15,130 --> 00:42:20,560
whatever to trying to poison the body of

1118
00:42:17,350 --> 00:42:22,868
information users leverage to figure out

1119
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:24,670
what they should be doing and I think

1120
00:42:22,869 --> 00:42:26,320
it's it's it's a brilliant tactic and

1121
00:42:24,670 --> 00:42:30,609
it's extremely dangerous from a

1122
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:32,940
defensive this perspective so so what do

1123
00:42:30,609 --> 00:42:35,650
we do so we do two things number one

1124
00:42:32,940 --> 00:42:36,220
we're incredibly aggressive in in

1125
00:42:35,650 --> 00:42:39,550
takedowns

1126
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:41,680
sites social media everything we can

1127
00:42:39,550 --> 00:42:43,420
take down we take down as soon as

1128
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:45,190
possible this is this is sort of like

1129
00:42:43,420 --> 00:42:48,220
harm reduction right we wanted we want

1130
00:42:45,190 --> 00:42:50,650
to stem the bleeding as much as possible

1131
00:42:48,220 --> 00:42:53,109
so they're fewer users are impacted

1132
00:42:50,650 --> 00:42:55,570
second thing we do or we're doing I

1133
00:42:53,109 --> 00:42:57,009
should say is is a lot of work columns

1134
00:42:55,570 --> 00:42:58,510
are a screen sharing detection that's

1135
00:42:57,010 --> 00:43:01,450
sort of the commonality and how this

1136
00:42:58,510 --> 00:43:03,300
exploitation occurs is at some point of

1137
00:43:01,450 --> 00:43:05,950
screen sharing app it's gets installed

1138
00:43:03,300 --> 00:43:07,210
some success some failures depends on

1139
00:43:05,950 --> 00:43:08,410
the apps being used

1140
00:43:07,210 --> 00:43:10,690
there's some interesting stuff we're

1141
00:43:08,410 --> 00:43:12,730
seeing in in mouse movements differences

1142
00:43:10,690 --> 00:43:14,859
and in keystroke timing differences that

1143
00:43:12,730 --> 00:43:16,480
we think might be a generic fingerprint

1144
00:43:14,859 --> 00:43:21,670
we can use but it's an area where sort

1145
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:23,710
of actively exploring I'm gonna skip

1146
00:43:21,670 --> 00:43:24,730
through bound works pretty quick four

1147
00:43:23,710 --> 00:43:26,560
key regions one number one it's not that

1148
00:43:24,730 --> 00:43:29,020
interesting the story I want to talk

1149
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:31,359
about this is is is not you know yes

1150
00:43:29,020 --> 00:43:33,340
banking malware is is pivoting to be to

1151
00:43:31,359 --> 00:43:36,609
target cryptocurrency companies that's

1152
00:43:33,340 --> 00:43:37,420
probably not a shock the the fun thing

1153
00:43:36,609 --> 00:43:40,720
though

1154
00:43:37,420 --> 00:43:43,059
is how some overdoing it so this is the

1155
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:47,020
the graphic there's is a screenshot of a

1156
00:43:43,059 --> 00:43:49,690
web page for a clone of a secure browser

1157
00:43:47,020 --> 00:43:51,730
called called crypto secure but the

1158
00:43:49,690 --> 00:43:53,049
attackers made the clone and then they

1159
00:43:51,730 --> 00:43:56,440
made him live it's actually malware

1160
00:43:53,049 --> 00:43:59,079
surprise surprise but what they did is

1161
00:43:56,440 --> 00:44:01,210
that little green box down there right

1162
00:43:59,079 --> 00:44:02,950
so that's actually a picture scraped

1163
00:44:01,210 --> 00:44:05,890
from LinkedIn of a guy who runs my

1164
00:44:02,950 --> 00:44:08,740
security ops 2 they ginned up a fake

1165
00:44:05,890 --> 00:44:10,480
quote attributed to him we know that

1166
00:44:08,740 --> 00:44:13,868
because he has much better grammar than

1167
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:15,730
this quote has and then they scraped a

1168
00:44:13,869 --> 00:44:18,130
bunch of content off of some security

1169
00:44:15,730 --> 00:44:20,410
blogs the grid right so the interesting

1170
00:44:18,130 --> 00:44:22,349
thing about this is the level of

1171
00:44:20,410 --> 00:44:25,180
investment they're putting into

1172
00:44:22,349 --> 00:44:28,150
targeting this directly at users of

1173
00:44:25,180 --> 00:44:32,200
given platforms and creating that sense

1174
00:44:28,150 --> 00:44:33,490
of trust by leveraging you know if you

1175
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:34,750
go research oh who's this Matt Mueller

1176
00:44:33,490 --> 00:44:36,399
guy oh it works it going bass your

1177
00:44:34,750 --> 00:44:38,440
unsecured operations that seems like a

1178
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:41,859
guy you would trust to say things about

1179
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:43,510
this right really really interesting and

1180
00:44:41,859 --> 00:44:48,000
not something I commonly see or a

1181
00:44:43,510 --> 00:44:48,000
commonly seen across malware previously

1182
00:44:49,770 --> 00:44:54,549
kind of register malware it's it's all

1183
00:44:52,839 --> 00:44:55,779
the sudden same stuff that you do for

1184
00:44:54,549 --> 00:45:00,400
banking malware it's there's nothing

1185
00:44:55,780 --> 00:45:01,839
about shockingly new here some bottom

1186
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:05,799
line and I'm gonna end up right on time

1187
00:45:01,839 --> 00:45:06,819
which is outstanding I don't know which

1188
00:45:05,799 --> 00:45:08,650
of these techniques is gonna trickle

1189
00:45:06,819 --> 00:45:10,240
down I don't know when is gonna happen

1190
00:45:08,650 --> 00:45:14,740
it may be techniques that are on here

1191
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:17,169
yet it may become widespread or not but

1192
00:45:14,740 --> 00:45:18,700
I've have overall high confidence that

1193
00:45:17,170 --> 00:45:20,859
if you're running a consumer facing

1194
00:45:18,700 --> 00:45:23,290
application you will start to see some

1195
00:45:20,859 --> 00:45:25,058
of these techniques trickle down over

1196
00:45:23,290 --> 00:45:27,670
time and they will start to impact your

1197
00:45:25,059 --> 00:45:29,859
users that's the the intent of coming up

1198
00:45:27,670 --> 00:45:31,089
here and talking about this is to give

1199
00:45:29,859 --> 00:45:33,220
you guys a view into sort of what we're

1200
00:45:31,089 --> 00:45:38,290
seeing with with with that belief in

1201
00:45:33,220 --> 00:45:39,848
mind right number two we have to have to

1202
00:45:38,290 --> 00:45:42,220
do with industry invest in normalizing

1203
00:45:39,849 --> 00:45:45,520
2fa not deploying to a PHA not rolling

1204
00:45:42,220 --> 00:45:49,000
out to of a normalizing 2fa so that it

1205
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:51,370
is just as obvious and requires

1206
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:52,720
in everyone in in folks Minds right

1207
00:45:51,370 --> 00:45:55,509
that's the only way I think we're gonna

1208
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:58,779
start to really see a lasting and

1209
00:45:55,510 --> 00:46:00,970
durable victory in this game unless

1210
00:45:58,780 --> 00:46:03,460
thing I'll note is is talking to a

1211
00:46:00,970 --> 00:46:06,879
diverse global population about security

1212
00:46:03,460 --> 00:46:08,650
is actually super hard and not well

1213
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:10,750
researched right how do you deliver a

1214
00:46:08,650 --> 00:46:13,570
security message in Japan and in New

1215
00:46:10,750 --> 00:46:14,770
York and in London how do you tweak them

1216
00:46:13,570 --> 00:46:17,890
how are they different how they need to

1217
00:46:14,770 --> 00:46:19,300
be how do they need to be adjusted all

1218
00:46:17,890 --> 00:46:22,270
right so will you I hope I can present

1219
00:46:19,300 --> 00:46:23,620
some work in this in this area later but

1220
00:46:22,270 --> 00:46:25,270
I would also call for other large

1221
00:46:23,620 --> 00:46:27,009
platforms that have done this in the

1222
00:46:25,270 --> 00:46:28,720
past that makes them less tough public

1223
00:46:27,010 --> 00:46:30,310
right this is really really important

1224
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:32,799
the way we talk to users about security

1225
00:46:30,310 --> 00:46:36,940
has has to evolve and has to become more

1226
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:38,140
targeted with vats if you guys wanna

1227
00:46:36,940 --> 00:46:41,650
start if you have questions start

1228
00:46:38,140 --> 00:46:44,560
queuing up and hey I hope this is been a

1229
00:46:41,650 --> 00:46:45,910
useful view into how we see ATO I hope

1230
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:48,460
you would walk away with an idea or two

1231
00:46:45,910 --> 00:46:50,200
that you can use or at least an area to

1232
00:46:48,460 --> 00:46:53,740
research from Ural for your organization

1233
00:46:50,200 --> 00:46:55,000
and last thing my team would kill me if

1234
00:46:53,740 --> 00:46:57,729
I didn't mention we're hiring we're

1235
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:59,770
hiring and literally everything so if

1236
00:46:57,730 --> 00:47:01,900
this sounds like a really fun problem

1237
00:46:59,770 --> 00:47:03,640
set for you guys either hit me up

1238
00:47:01,900 --> 00:47:05,940
afterwards or corn-based , / curriers

1239
00:47:03,640 --> 00:47:09,080
thank you all very much

1240
00:47:05,940 --> 00:47:15,590
[Applause]

1241
00:47:09,080 --> 00:47:17,630
I do have a question so it seems like

1242
00:47:15,590 --> 00:47:19,580
you're aware when you block an attack

1243
00:47:17,630 --> 00:47:21,830
but if an attack goes through in the and

1244
00:47:19,580 --> 00:47:24,980
the user does lose money and it's clear

1245
00:47:21,830 --> 00:47:26,990
that this was a type of cyber theft

1246
00:47:24,980 --> 00:47:29,870
how does coinbase respond do you guys

1247
00:47:26,990 --> 00:47:32,330
have some insurance or is it the users

1248
00:47:29,870 --> 00:47:34,850
just out of luck or so

1249
00:47:32,330 --> 00:47:37,100
we we look at her in a case by case

1250
00:47:34,850 --> 00:47:40,310
basis around like what was what what

1251
00:47:37,100 --> 00:47:41,480
actually happened right is this like in

1252
00:47:40,310 --> 00:47:45,200
the u.s. we think about this in sort of

1253
00:47:41,480 --> 00:47:48,380
a shared responsibility model and we try

1254
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:50,750
to as best we can a portion like okay

1255
00:47:48,380 --> 00:47:52,220
yep our controls fail that was our

1256
00:47:50,750 --> 00:47:54,470
faults will make you whole

1257
00:47:52,220 --> 00:47:56,600
look you typed your password into a

1258
00:47:54,470 --> 00:47:59,209
phishing site and ignored our alerts for

1259
00:47:56,600 --> 00:48:00,860
three days like there's a there's a

1260
00:47:59,210 --> 00:48:05,390
there's a shared responsibility there

1261
00:48:00,860 --> 00:48:06,980
okay that's curious if you could say

1262
00:48:05,390 --> 00:48:09,200
anything about current adoption of

1263
00:48:06,980 --> 00:48:10,280
physical tokens like Yubikey and how you

1264
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:13,310
think those are gonna roll out in the

1265
00:48:10,280 --> 00:48:16,580
future thank you yep so right now we're

1266
00:48:13,310 --> 00:48:20,450
so we release TV key or more broadly web

1267
00:48:16,580 --> 00:48:21,890
both in supports for coinbase I want to

1268
00:48:20,450 --> 00:48:24,439
say was two months ago two or three

1269
00:48:21,890 --> 00:48:26,440
months ago we see about 1% adoption

1270
00:48:24,440 --> 00:48:28,940
right now across across the user base

1271
00:48:26,440 --> 00:48:30,160
but that's fair we haven't pushed it

1272
00:48:28,940 --> 00:48:34,670
very hard as that's pretty organic

1273
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:36,740
uptake at this point so as we start to

1274
00:48:34,670 --> 00:48:39,410
push campaigns around it and start to

1275
00:48:36,740 --> 00:48:41,930
actively push users into that funnel we

1276
00:48:39,410 --> 00:48:45,770
think it will go up go up quite a fair

1277
00:48:41,930 --> 00:48:47,660
bit I have a another question truthfully

1278
00:48:45,770 --> 00:48:49,460
do you have any insight into which phone

1279
00:48:47,660 --> 00:48:51,350
service providers are more or less

1280
00:48:49,460 --> 00:48:54,350
susceptible susceptible to sim swapping

1281
00:48:51,350 --> 00:48:56,120
it may be I don't know if you maybe

1282
00:48:54,350 --> 00:48:57,860
should name any particular ones I'm not

1283
00:48:56,120 --> 00:49:00,319
sure I'll tell you my positive

1284
00:48:57,860 --> 00:49:02,270
recommendation sure and and 7s um so

1285
00:49:00,320 --> 00:49:04,520
Google pie is really really good okay

1286
00:49:02,270 --> 00:49:06,800
around some swapping info according cool

1287
00:49:04,520 --> 00:49:07,160
I use it and it's one reason that I like

1288
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:08,930
it

1289
00:49:07,160 --> 00:49:12,328
outstanding

1290
00:49:08,930 --> 00:49:16,129
hi I didn't catch how you found out that

1291
00:49:12,329 --> 00:49:19,560
the fake coin based locations existed um

1292
00:49:16,130 --> 00:49:24,060
I actually don't recall how we found

1293
00:49:19,560 --> 00:49:26,520
that out I think we were I don't call it

1294
00:49:24,060 --> 00:49:28,650
scanning like to see if those pop up

1295
00:49:26,520 --> 00:49:32,190
right it was it was almost certainly we

1296
00:49:28,650 --> 00:49:33,960
were we were looking at search results

1297
00:49:32,190 --> 00:49:35,609
early to coinbase we do a lot of

1298
00:49:33,960 --> 00:49:36,750
monitoring of like what results are

1299
00:49:35,609 --> 00:49:38,549
showing up in searches for coin based we

1300
00:49:36,750 --> 00:49:39,839
care about it was almost certainly we

1301
00:49:38,550 --> 00:49:42,030
were doing one of those and happened to

1302
00:49:39,839 --> 00:49:43,680
see one and then started digging and

1303
00:49:42,030 --> 00:49:47,550
discovered the broader problem okay

1304
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:49,740
thank you yeah so there are some

1305
00:49:47,550 --> 00:49:51,869
carriers in in other countries that

1306
00:49:49,740 --> 00:49:54,328
actually have api's where you can

1307
00:49:51,869 --> 00:49:58,130
actually see how recently a sim them

1308
00:49:54,329 --> 00:50:00,750
changed why don't we have that here that

1309
00:49:58,130 --> 00:50:04,530
is a wonderful question and I wish I

1310
00:50:00,750 --> 00:50:07,890
knew the answer to that I would love it

1311
00:50:04,530 --> 00:50:10,079
if we did there are actually some there

1312
00:50:07,890 --> 00:50:12,690
are some initiatives to build things

1313
00:50:10,079 --> 00:50:14,430
like that here but nothing that's

1314
00:50:12,690 --> 00:50:15,960
actually landed yet so I hope I hope it

1315
00:50:14,430 --> 00:50:19,859
does in the future make my life way

1316
00:50:15,960 --> 00:50:21,720
easier yeah thank you yeah on one of the

1317
00:50:19,859 --> 00:50:25,049
earliest slides you mentioned it timed

1318
00:50:21,720 --> 00:50:26,578
one-time passwords can be cracked can

1319
00:50:25,050 --> 00:50:28,680
you just give us an idea of how that

1320
00:50:26,579 --> 00:50:32,010
attack might work yep so not cracked

1321
00:50:28,680 --> 00:50:34,319
stole more bypassed right so what we see

1322
00:50:32,010 --> 00:50:39,000
most commonly is either as I mentioned

1323
00:50:34,319 --> 00:50:40,710
sort of the the the correctional theft

1324
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:45,000
stuff right let's integrate has an

1325
00:50:40,710 --> 00:50:46,619
integrated qtp theft function right or

1326
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:49,020
well the other the other thing we see

1327
00:50:46,619 --> 00:50:51,030
commonly is as attackers gain access to

1328
00:50:49,020 --> 00:50:53,130
Gmail and targeted attacks one of the

1329
00:50:51,030 --> 00:50:57,119
things they search for right up front or

1330
00:50:53,130 --> 00:50:59,670
totp seeds and backup codes it's part of

1331
00:50:57,119 --> 00:51:01,530
their standard search playbook I'm

1332
00:50:59,670 --> 00:51:02,760
getting the red light I got to get down

1333
00:51:01,530 --> 00:51:04,360
because I'm more questions happy to take

1334
00:51:02,760 --> 00:51:08,760
them offline thank you all very much

1335
00:51:04,360 --> 00:51:08,760
