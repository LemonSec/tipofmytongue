Orion Cove are I'm a principal security

65
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:24,269
strategist that's Splunk I'm a blue team

66
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:28,109
or through and through that's what I

67
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:29,849
love to do the network Ranna helped run

68
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:31,709
a cyber counterintelligence season sale

69
00:02:29,849 --> 00:02:33,810
at DARPA before I came to Splunk I do a

70
00:02:31,709 --> 00:02:35,730
lot of fun things around traveling the

71
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:37,470
world trying to fix problems look for

72
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:39,269
cool security issues and do some

73
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:40,980
research and development on it I also

74
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:44,280
really hate printers and if you ever ask

75
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:44,670
me to bring something I will cry so good

76
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:46,380
to know

77
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:47,869
second off we are going to be using

78
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:50,850
Splunk throughout this presentation

79
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:52,950
think of this as the canvas that we're

80
00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:55,049
going to paint our narrative upon many

81
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:57,268
of you do use Blanc at home some don't

82
00:02:55,049 --> 00:02:59,040
this is really just a way to show the

83
00:02:57,269 --> 00:03:00,660
technique techniques and the tactics so

84
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:02,370
we're gonna be talking about today and

85
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:04,500
this is how we're gonna paint our story

86
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:06,060
so use whatever you want the concepts

87
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:08,069
apply everywhere we're just going to use

88
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:10,049
plunk because they pay for like 90% of

89
00:03:08,069 --> 00:03:11,569
my wardrobe at this point so we're gonna

90
00:03:10,049 --> 00:03:14,310
keep it there

91
00:03:11,569 --> 00:03:16,380
agenda we're going to tell story I think

92
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:18,000
the best way to educate to describe

93
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:19,290
anything as a go through our narrative

94
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,220
and that's what we're gonna do today

95
00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:22,650
we're going to talk about a small

96
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:24,150
company called FRA flea then we're going

97
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:26,519
to talk about how it all went wrong they

98
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:28,560
thought things were good and then it did

99
00:03:26,519 --> 00:03:30,120
not go so well and then we're going to

100
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:32,519
fix them we're in a pass go and collect

101
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:36,359
200 P P piece which will be pretty

102
00:03:32,519 --> 00:03:38,370
awesome first off some of you have

103
00:03:36,359 --> 00:03:39,900
probably heard of attack I've had some

104
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:41,549
conversations in the hallway ahead of

105
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:43,200
time about people who knew it didn't

106
00:03:41,549 --> 00:03:45,000
know it there's some people who are

107
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:46,500
pretty angry about attack we're gonna

108
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,820
address that some people who love it but

109
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:49,829
didn't get everything out of it that

110
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:51,420
they kind of hoped so we're gonna really

111
00:03:49,829 --> 00:03:53,070
talk today the story it's gonna be about

112
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:54,570
how do you use it and overcome some of

113
00:03:53,070 --> 00:03:57,390
those common pitfalls and issues that

114
00:03:54,570 --> 00:03:59,810
you may have seen so you can think of

115
00:03:57,390 --> 00:04:05,458
this as a story we're gonna be telling

116
00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:07,709
neverending story do do do do do do and

117
00:04:05,459 --> 00:04:09,090
if you are a certain age bracket you're

118
00:04:07,709 --> 00:04:11,069
not gonna get that song out of your head

119
00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:14,069
for a week if you're outside those

120
00:04:11,069 --> 00:04:16,829
whiskers I'm sorry it's on YouTube so

121
00:04:14,069 --> 00:04:18,988
the story properly very small start-up

122
00:04:16,829 --> 00:04:20,310
in San Francisco they do brewery

123
00:04:18,988 --> 00:04:22,950
equipment they make really awesome

124
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:24,659
innovative beers they are just full of

125
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:26,490
cool things and they're doing the best

126
00:04:24,659 --> 00:04:28,740
they can and they have a very small but

127
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:31,210
awesome cybersecurity

128
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:34,180
so let's meet each of our characters

129
00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:35,919
from froth Li and introduce you to some

130
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:38,260
of their problems that we can see if

131
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:40,270
attack and help them out with first up

132
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:43,630
we have grapes hoppy are empowered

133
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:46,299
awesome female CEO and her challenge is

134
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:48,760
she's not totally sure how our networks

135
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:50,920
are defended at froth Li and that makes

136
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:52,539
her a little bit insecure so you might

137
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:54,490
have met some executives or leaders like

138
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:56,050
this who as soon as they see something

139
00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:57,520
in the news they kind of shoot you off

140
00:04:56,050 --> 00:04:59,350
an email up call you at 8 o'clock at

141
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:00,969
night what's happening with this it

142
00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:03,010
hasn't even be done executive you might

143
00:05:00,970 --> 00:05:04,870
be that executive no judgment we get it

144
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:09,280
you're insecure you're uncomfortable so

145
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:11,860
that's grace our CEO next up Mallory

146
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:13,840
Crowson from threat Intel team so

147
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:15,700
Mallory she's well-intentioned she's a

148
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:18,640
great analyst but she's sort of stuck in

149
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:21,849
this rut of just scanning networks and

150
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:24,610
gathering IP addresses domain names hash

151
00:05:21,850 --> 00:05:26,590
values and they found some value there

152
00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:28,720
but she's not really sure what else she

153
00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:31,960
can do for threat Intel that's Mallory

154
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:34,720
from the threat Intel team next up Alice

155
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:36,969
our network defender extraordinaire so

156
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:39,490
she has a bunch of data she has a sim

157
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:42,610
she has these data sources she's kind of

158
00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:44,200
drowning and alerts and she has all the

159
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:46,750
alerts in the world but isn't able to

160
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:50,860
catch real adversaries she has a data

161
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:53,350
and alerting problem as a defender last

162
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:56,200
but not least we have Kevin our red

163
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:58,330
teamer here's a kind heart he wants to

164
00:05:56,200 --> 00:06:00,729
help defenders and the blue team improve

165
00:05:58,330 --> 00:06:02,349
but he's just not sure how he's gone in

166
00:06:00,730 --> 00:06:05,440
he's done red team operations in the

167
00:06:02,350 --> 00:06:07,870
past but he can't really communicate how

168
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:09,969
to help defense improve based on that so

169
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:13,180
that's Kevin rounding out our cast of

170
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:17,830
four characters in broccoli so breaking

171
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:20,290
news SS Hopson ale has had a cyber

172
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:21,909
attack by what appears to be an Iranian

173
00:06:20,290 --> 00:06:23,860
threat group we're not positive about

174
00:06:21,910 --> 00:06:26,290
this but this has caused some major

175
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:30,400
issues through the possible global hops

176
00:06:26,290 --> 00:06:32,140
and ale network and frankly grace is not

177
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:34,599
happy so what did she do

178
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:36,700
first thing off sends an email to our

179
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:39,100
threat intelligence analyst Mallory

180
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:41,169
Mallory I need you to find out how this

181
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:42,699
will impact us and how we're defend

182
00:06:41,169 --> 00:06:44,378
what are we gonna do right we've all

183
00:06:42,699 --> 00:06:46,360
gotten this email somebody wakes up

184
00:06:44,379 --> 00:06:50,050
watches FoxNews freaks out you get that

185
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:52,509
email so Malory is a threat analyst

186
00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:55,210
she's given this tasking hey are we

187
00:06:52,509 --> 00:06:56,439
affected by any Iranian groups and she

188
00:06:55,210 --> 00:06:58,060
hasn't really been tracking that's just

189
00:06:56,439 --> 00:07:00,400
tracked one or two you know criminal

190
00:06:58,060 --> 00:07:03,400
groups that uh as targeted broadly in

191
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:04,840
the past so she has to figure out how do

192
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:07,179
I find out who these Iranian threat

193
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:10,448
groups are and can attack help her out

194
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:13,360
in this like any good analyst she does

195
00:07:10,449 --> 00:07:15,279
what I do start with Google let's go boy

196
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:17,740
Ron Ian's threat groups and see what

197
00:07:15,279 --> 00:07:20,139
pops out within her first few hits

198
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:23,110
there's this hit for this mitre attack

199
00:07:20,139 --> 00:07:26,740
thing it's a group thing there's Iranian

200
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:28,270
threat group some keywords there clicks

201
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:30,279
that link not sure what it is but it

202
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:33,639
brings her to this page of different

203
00:07:30,279 --> 00:07:35,919
groups scans through that and sees okay

204
00:07:33,639 --> 00:07:38,650
oil rig as I suspected Iranian threat

205
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:41,620
group so maybe that's something that she

206
00:07:38,650 --> 00:07:43,628
might care about what what is the deal

207
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:45,250
with Iranian threat group Saint oil rig

208
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:47,620
I just don't know what that is if only

209
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:50,860
there was a way to find out if only I

210
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:53,349
mean luckily there is Malory keeps

211
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:55,629
reading she takes a look at the oil rig

212
00:07:53,349 --> 00:07:56,919
group page on the attack website she

213
00:07:55,629 --> 00:07:58,539
reads a little bit information a little

214
00:07:56,919 --> 00:08:00,580
background about the targeting of this

215
00:07:58,539 --> 00:08:03,490
group some of the names that have had

216
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:06,310
overlap with that oil rig name different

217
00:08:03,490 --> 00:08:08,229
techniques used not totally sure what

218
00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:10,839
those techniques are but she keeps

219
00:08:08,229 --> 00:08:13,750
reading this group page goes down to the

220
00:08:10,839 --> 00:08:15,909
end sees these references clicks on a

221
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:17,889
few of those she is you know a lot of

222
00:08:15,909 --> 00:08:18,729
these great blog posts that many of you

223
00:08:17,889 --> 00:08:20,919
alright

224
00:08:18,729 --> 00:08:25,620
Scrolls to the end CC has some ip's that

225
00:08:20,919 --> 00:08:25,620
she can actions and domain names perfect

226
00:08:26,069 --> 00:08:31,270
so then she sees this matrix thing which

227
00:08:29,589 --> 00:08:32,820
is a little confusing there's all these

228
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:35,140
hyperlinks there's all these names

229
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:36,940
tactics techniques it looks like a

230
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:38,500
spreadsheet it's the twentieth

231
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:40,149
anniversary of one of the best movies

232
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:42,729
ever made the only movie ever made named

233
00:08:40,149 --> 00:08:46,269
matrix and she doesn't really know what

234
00:08:42,729 --> 00:08:48,459
this is all about so she keeps reading

235
00:08:46,269 --> 00:08:50,680
on the website and what she finds is

236
00:08:48,459 --> 00:08:53,439
well this matrix is just kind of a

237
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:54,380
visualization of a larger knowledge base

238
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:58,370
of adversary

239
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:59,810
haters that is attack she reads more and

240
00:08:58,370 --> 00:09:01,250
finds out that this is maintained by

241
00:08:59,810 --> 00:09:04,219
mightor it's based on real-world

242
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:06,080
observations attack isn't meant to be a

243
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:08,150
theoretical proof of concept

244
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:09,500
it's what real adversaries have done in

245
00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:11,800
the past or they're likely to do

246
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:14,720
cutting-edge red teamers are doing and

247
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:16,939
there's value in that because from a

248
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:18,170
threat Intel perspective we care about

249
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:21,140
what adversaries are doing to help

250
00:09:18,170 --> 00:09:22,880
prioritize what we focus on she also

251
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:26,240
kind of looks at the matrix layout and

252
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:27,890
sees their tactics across the top these

253
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:29,750
are the adversaries technical goals

254
00:09:27,890 --> 00:09:32,720
things like how do they gain initial

255
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:34,670
access how do they establish persistence

256
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:37,340
once they're in a network how do they

257
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:39,740
move laterally under each of those

258
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:42,530
tactics are what are called techniques

259
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:44,540
that's how those tactics are achieved

260
00:09:42,530 --> 00:09:46,610
how those goals are achieved so for

261
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:49,099
example under the initial access tactic

262
00:09:46,610 --> 00:09:51,620
spear-phishing attachment would be a

263
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:52,880
technique and the next level there you

264
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:55,580
see some examples of different

265
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:58,070
procedures great TTP's tactics

266
00:09:55,580 --> 00:10:00,590
techniques and procedures so for example

267
00:09:58,070 --> 00:10:03,050
spear fishing with an xlsx attachment

268
00:10:00,590 --> 00:10:04,640
would be a procedure so she's kind of

269
00:10:03,050 --> 00:10:06,199
getting this idea okay attack this

270
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:09,380
knowledge base of different adversary

271
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:16,490
behaviors lots of techniques and how can

272
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:18,680
i maybe use this so back to email well

273
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:20,420
we all use everyday she she fires off an

274
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:21,829
email back to Greece gives her some

275
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:23,030
quick information from what she's

276
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:24,470
learned because remember this is a small

277
00:10:23,030 --> 00:10:26,150
company they don't necessarily have

278
00:10:24,470 --> 00:10:27,470
enough money to pay for a really good

279
00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:29,120
threat intelligence so she's really

280
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:31,100
depending on the open source resources

281
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:32,630
looking at those reference documents we

282
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:34,070
talked about and that's just a great

283
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:35,750
place to start for her she's really

284
00:10:34,070 --> 00:10:38,180
happy she's able to go back to Greece

285
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:40,670
and said hey turns out these Iranians

286
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:41,989
we've taken over a tanker full of beer

287
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:43,729
and ale and hops

288
00:10:41,990 --> 00:10:46,280
that's totally a threat to us we should

289
00:10:43,730 --> 00:10:48,710
do some more research goes to the

290
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:50,360
technique section of The MITRE attack

291
00:10:48,710 --> 00:10:53,600
and then send some of those over to

292
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:55,550
Alice hey blot these indicators right we

293
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:57,830
know what indicators are Alice and

294
00:10:55,550 --> 00:11:00,859
Mallory are both huge fans of these

295
00:10:57,830 --> 00:11:03,230
lower level things ip's hashes we know -

296
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:05,210
do we know how to search for these I got

297
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:07,130
this I'm not really quite sure what this

298
00:11:05,210 --> 00:11:08,160
TTP thing is but we're gonna we're gonna

299
00:11:07,130 --> 00:11:10,680
find out

300
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:13,530
all right Alice takes a look kind of

301
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:16,109
goes into it I just looked through like

302
00:11:13,530 --> 00:11:17,550
75 different IP addresses I don't see

303
00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:19,290
any hits and for those of you who've

304
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:21,180
been around back won the day when the

305
00:11:19,290 --> 00:11:23,610
app1 report dropped and your boss gave

306
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:26,040
you 3,000 indicators to look through you

307
00:11:23,610 --> 00:11:27,600
kind of know this feeling right I'm not

308
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:29,760
sure we're not compromised but I don't

309
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:32,130
see any indicators in our sim so what's

310
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:33,630
going on here that's really where this

311
00:11:32,130 --> 00:11:34,980
technique thing came in and she's pretty

312
00:11:33,630 --> 00:11:38,220
interested in this but really doesn't

313
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:40,380
know much about it so how does Alice as

314
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:42,240
a network defender stop with her

315
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:44,120
indicator hoarding and try to move

316
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:47,040
towards detecting these techniques

317
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:49,290
hungry hungry hippo model of indicator

318
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:52,050
hoarding move away from that towards

319
00:11:49,290 --> 00:11:54,599
detecting those behaviors so she brings

320
00:11:52,050 --> 00:11:57,329
up that oil-rig page and starts to scan

321
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:58,800
through those techniques maybe she's not

322
00:11:57,330 --> 00:12:01,440
familiar but she starts to see okay

323
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:03,660
discovery these are the discovery tactic

324
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:04,770
as an adversary gets on a network they

325
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:06,120
have to figure out kind of where they

326
00:12:04,770 --> 00:12:08,100
are or what they can do

327
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:10,470
so she scans through she recognizes

328
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:12,690
commands like Who am I system owner user

329
00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:14,850
discovery that's the technique there she

330
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:17,370
recognizes a few others like task list

331
00:12:14,850 --> 00:12:20,250
which is process discovery so she clicks

332
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:21,870
on that one takes a closer look a little

333
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:24,290
more information about what this

334
00:12:21,870 --> 00:12:26,550
technique of process discovery is and

335
00:12:24,290 --> 00:12:28,860
she's trying to figure out well how

336
00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:31,079
would I detect this on my network

337
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:32,580
good question so luckily she sees on the

338
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:35,100
right side there's this little data

339
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:36,480
sources section that tells her well if

340
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:38,880
you're trying to detect this technique

341
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:41,910
maybe check out process monitoring or

342
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:43,620
process command-line parameters yeah

343
00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:45,510
maybe they don't have a ton on process

344
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:46,800
monitoring but she knows they do have a

345
00:12:45,510 --> 00:12:48,210
little bit of command line collection

346
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:51,000
she remembers she's drowning in her data

347
00:12:48,210 --> 00:12:52,830
so maybe there's something that she can

348
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,540
do there to kind of look at that process

349
00:12:52,830 --> 00:12:58,080
command line data start to write

350
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:59,819
detection on this one technique so she

351
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:01,800
goes right into her Network here and

352
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:04,530
finds out that hey turns out we collect

353
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:06,599
of encode 468 you're not familiar with

354
00:13:04,530 --> 00:13:08,130
that go research it it is awesome for

355
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:09,840
anything around processes and command

356
00:13:08,130 --> 00:13:12,450
lines to really love it and turns out

357
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:14,280
Alice has - so she goes into her sim she

358
00:13:12,450 --> 00:13:16,110
quickly writes a little a little

359
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:18,360
detection search here to create an alert

360
00:13:16,110 --> 00:13:19,560
very simple and she's smarter she knows

361
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:21,220
she wants to go back and understand

362
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:22,959
exactly what this is she

363
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:26,160
she puts in the description that hey

364
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:29,469
this is for you no miter attack t-105

365
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:31,959
7-tesla sexy and you'll notice this is a

366
00:13:29,470 --> 00:13:33,730
very a comic sort of search here it is

367
00:13:31,959 --> 00:13:36,849
literally just looking for the words

368
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:38,490
task list see that's what's in the miter

369
00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:40,959
attack framework that's what she can see

370
00:13:38,490 --> 00:13:42,639
and then she does this 41 more times

371
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:44,910
because there's 41 more techniques

372
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:47,470
within miter attack that she can write

373
00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:49,269
techniques for signatures for in her Sam

374
00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:51,490
and so she goes down that line if

375
00:13:49,269 --> 00:13:54,870
there's a technique if there's a t she

376
00:13:51,490 --> 00:13:58,149
now has a sim rule all the way down

377
00:13:54,870 --> 00:14:00,189
awesome we're awesome forty-one

378
00:13:58,149 --> 00:14:01,870
techniques 41 techniques she's looked at

379
00:14:00,189 --> 00:14:04,149
the attack website and she's found this

380
00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:05,889
tool called the attack navigator that

381
00:14:04,149 --> 00:14:07,449
can help visualize what they know about

382
00:14:05,889 --> 00:14:09,910
different techniques so they've been

383
00:14:07,449 --> 00:14:11,889
through all those 41 techniques they've

384
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:14,410
ridden at least one detection for each

385
00:14:11,889 --> 00:14:17,019
of those so they fill in green for each

386
00:14:14,410 --> 00:14:18,759
of those techniques 244 Enterprise

387
00:14:17,019 --> 00:14:21,160
attack techniques and they fill in all

388
00:14:18,759 --> 00:14:22,569
41 with green of course they have to

389
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:24,490
follow up with grace because she's like

390
00:14:22,569 --> 00:14:27,878
are we protected against this Iranian

391
00:14:24,490 --> 00:14:30,040
threat so they briefed it to grace grace

392
00:14:27,879 --> 00:14:32,559
breach the board we are a hundred

393
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:34,689
percent protected against oil rig our

394
00:14:32,559 --> 00:14:36,550
number one threat we are good to go I

395
00:14:34,689 --> 00:14:38,139
think they're fine I think they're good

396
00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:42,250
but everything's fine here

397
00:14:38,139 --> 00:14:43,689
yeah but they are a full team like we

398
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:45,279
said this is actually although a small

399
00:14:43,689 --> 00:14:46,930
team they really got their stuff

400
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:49,720
together so they turn to their red team

401
00:14:46,930 --> 00:14:52,449
and they say Kevin can you actually

402
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:53,889
start testing these similar so we've

403
00:14:52,449 --> 00:14:55,420
created these searches can you actually

404
00:14:53,889 --> 00:14:56,680
find these detection can you make sure

405
00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:59,050
that we're triggering the right things

406
00:14:56,680 --> 00:15:01,660
so Kevin does some work he looks around

407
00:14:59,050 --> 00:15:03,459
he Google's Red Team and attack and he

408
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:05,199
finds his awesome open source project

409
00:15:03,459 --> 00:15:07,000
called atomic Red Team and this is a

410
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:10,269
really cool project that actually will

411
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:12,790
map all the TTP's in attack two things

412
00:15:10,269 --> 00:15:14,259
that real-world red teamer so partly led

413
00:15:12,790 --> 00:15:16,750
by the great group over at red canary

414
00:15:14,259 --> 00:15:19,269
will actually go through and find ways

415
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:21,459
actually make sure that a blue team can

416
00:15:19,269 --> 00:15:24,069
see things in their sim or detect or

417
00:15:21,459 --> 00:15:26,079
test these tvp's an attack and it's

418
00:15:24,069 --> 00:15:28,120
really cool so go through it and not

419
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:31,420
surprisingly as we've kept talking about

420
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:34,780
the way to find task list is by actually

421
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:36,729
running task list so he does that

422
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:38,380
so he runs and he goes to about 30 boxes

423
00:15:36,730 --> 00:15:40,440
and he runs TAS lists on all these

424
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:42,730
Windows servers and then sure enough

425
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:46,150
those incredible alerts that Alice

426
00:15:42,730 --> 00:15:49,360
created they pop up even went a little

427
00:15:46,150 --> 00:15:51,939
crazy ran PS turns out Alice had 41

428
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:54,250
TTP's and she wrote one for PS fear so

429
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:56,740
we are we are covered we're doing good

430
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:58,990
here all right all the attacks were

431
00:15:56,740 --> 00:16:01,870
detected when we emulated the oil rig

432
00:15:58,990 --> 00:16:05,110
adversary using atomic read team perfect

433
00:16:01,870 --> 00:16:06,700
I'm pretty happy at this point they're

434
00:16:05,110 --> 00:16:08,890
saying hey we did our job

435
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:11,020
we everything's fine we got mightor

436
00:16:08,890 --> 00:16:13,300
going we did atomic read team we wrote

437
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:16,260
some sim searches the Dane is coming in

438
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:18,910
this is gravy baby we're good to go

439
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:23,410
everything's all good until the dominoes

440
00:16:18,910 --> 00:16:25,540
start to fall one by one grace gets a

441
00:16:23,410 --> 00:16:28,180
call early in the morning from FBI

442
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:31,270
Special Agent Steve Steve says yeah

443
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:31,780
sorry grace broccoli is pwned so uh good

444
00:16:31,270 --> 00:16:33,430
luck with that

445
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:35,850
sorry about that I thought you were

446
00:16:33,430 --> 00:16:39,400
covered nope you're totally compromised

447
00:16:35,850 --> 00:16:41,560
thanks Steve turns out although they

448
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:44,020
were doing really good on protecting

449
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:46,060
against oil rig there's a completely

450
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:48,100
fictional made up apt group that have

451
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:49,630
attacked them called Ted Hong Kong they

452
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:51,430
hadn't no clue about this mostly because

453
00:16:49,630 --> 00:16:52,930
I made it up earlier this year but the

454
00:16:51,430 --> 00:16:55,750
point is they were attacked by these

455
00:16:52,930 --> 00:16:57,370
guys they had no clue and if you look at

456
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:58,990
the diamond model for these sort of

457
00:16:57,370 --> 00:17:00,339
folks for the T dongdong adversary

458
00:16:58,990 --> 00:17:02,470
you'll actually notice there's some

459
00:17:00,339 --> 00:17:05,020
crossover in their capabilities if you

460
00:17:02,470 --> 00:17:06,760
were to map oil rig and T dongdong

461
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:08,859
there'd be about a twenty or thirty

462
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:10,780
percent overlap of attack techniques and

463
00:17:08,859 --> 00:17:12,429
tactics that they're actually using but

464
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:14,530
that's not 100 percent overlap so

465
00:17:12,430 --> 00:17:16,060
although frolf Lee did really well

466
00:17:14,530 --> 00:17:17,319
defending against oil rig they

467
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:18,698
completely missed the boat on these

468
00:17:17,319 --> 00:17:19,869
other adversary groups that they didn't

469
00:17:18,699 --> 00:17:22,000
pay any attention to you because they

470
00:17:19,869 --> 00:17:26,109
are so dialed in to that oil rig

471
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:28,630
conversation so now the broccoli team is

472
00:17:26,109 --> 00:17:31,149
kind of feeling like this and they're

473
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:33,310
not gonna lie we've heard from maybe

474
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:34,870
some of you in the room I know Ryan's

475
00:17:33,310 --> 00:17:36,970
heard from organizations and teams have

476
00:17:34,870 --> 00:17:38,830
used attack and they're like why did we

477
00:17:36,970 --> 00:17:40,810
ever use this in the first place this is

478
00:17:38,830 --> 00:17:43,449
not helpful this is not what we wanted

479
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:45,490
why are we here I attacked all my data

480
00:17:43,450 --> 00:17:47,860
and I have nothing to show for it sad

481
00:17:45,490 --> 00:17:49,720
day but the good news is

482
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:50,860
you can move past this maybe you're kind

483
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:52,870
of flipping the gameboard you've

484
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:57,850
implemented an attack and you're really

485
00:17:52,870 --> 00:17:59,260
unhappy now what do you do so let's talk

486
00:17:57,850 --> 00:18:00,699
about what went wrong and this is where

487
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:02,860
we're gonna break the fourth wall a

488
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:04,570
little bit of our narration here of this

489
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:07,539
fictional company with a fictional apt

490
00:18:04,570 --> 00:18:09,340
group we're gonna actually take this and

491
00:18:07,539 --> 00:18:11,169
try to ascribe how we see four awfully

492
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:13,178
what's wrong how they can fix it and

493
00:18:11,169 --> 00:18:14,860
this is all based on these stories and

494
00:18:13,179 --> 00:18:16,390
these narratives and these issues that

495
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:17,889
Katie and I have seen over the last two

496
00:18:16,390 --> 00:18:19,929
years as we watch people try to

497
00:18:17,890 --> 00:18:22,269
implement attacked and either fail or

498
00:18:19,929 --> 00:18:24,610
just not get the point of it or be

499
00:18:22,269 --> 00:18:26,500
really confused of I logged on there's a

500
00:18:24,610 --> 00:18:27,969
matrix there's 9,000 pages of

501
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:29,399
documentation and I really don't

502
00:18:27,970 --> 00:18:33,159
understand what I'm supposed to do right

503
00:18:29,399 --> 00:18:36,969
so let's go step by step here first off

504
00:18:33,159 --> 00:18:38,710
grace we're saying CX oh she's a CEO the

505
00:18:36,970 --> 00:18:40,779
reality is it doesn't matter what grace

506
00:18:38,710 --> 00:18:43,149
is is she's a leader right so what we're

507
00:18:40,779 --> 00:18:45,370
thinking here is the team lead the CISO

508
00:18:43,149 --> 00:18:47,590
the CTO it might be a manager of a

509
00:18:45,370 --> 00:18:49,268
thousand people it could be you wearing

510
00:18:47,590 --> 00:18:50,769
a whole bunch of different hats right

511
00:18:49,269 --> 00:18:53,139
but the point is when she went through

512
00:18:50,769 --> 00:18:55,029
this exercise she saw all this green

513
00:18:53,139 --> 00:18:58,090
that's what her team communicated to her

514
00:18:55,029 --> 00:19:00,429
and she did not actually have a secure

515
00:18:58,090 --> 00:19:02,379
Network and on top of that she's not

516
00:19:00,429 --> 00:19:04,539
really that technical anymore it's been

517
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:06,010
a long time so she doesn't know all the

518
00:19:04,539 --> 00:19:08,139
work they're talking about she isn't

519
00:19:06,010 --> 00:19:09,820
really sure what's going on so she had a

520
00:19:08,139 --> 00:19:11,490
really false sense of security based on

521
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:14,950
the communication coming from her team

522
00:19:11,490 --> 00:19:17,350
on a threat Intel side Mallory of the

523
00:19:14,950 --> 00:19:18,970
CTE analysts she did a good job looking

524
00:19:17,350 --> 00:19:21,549
into oil-rig she kind of provided those

525
00:19:18,970 --> 00:19:23,740
indicators to the defenders but when Ted

526
00:19:21,549 --> 00:19:24,668
hongkong came in she didn't know how to

527
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:27,010
respond to that

528
00:19:24,669 --> 00:19:29,409
they weren't tracking that threat so

529
00:19:27,010 --> 00:19:31,330
every organization has many different

530
00:19:29,409 --> 00:19:32,799
threats she couldn't follow up didn't

531
00:19:31,330 --> 00:19:34,720
really know how to action those new

532
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:37,960
threats and kind of adjust to that as

533
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:39,370
they came in Alice is a badass Network

534
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:41,139
defender right she knows what she's

535
00:19:39,370 --> 00:19:43,629
doing she took attack she looked for

536
00:19:41,139 --> 00:19:45,879
this indicator she found no IP addresses

537
00:19:43,630 --> 00:19:48,460
and she went down that list of 41

538
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:50,460
specific techniques and wrote a similar

539
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:53,139
assim search for each one of those and

540
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:54,669
she still had problems and she also

541
00:19:53,139 --> 00:19:56,500
didn't really understand what data she

542
00:19:54,669 --> 00:19:58,899
needed for all of these so she had gaps

543
00:19:56,500 --> 00:20:00,340
in her defenses and she started getting

544
00:19:58,899 --> 00:20:01,570
drowned by alerts because it turns out

545
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:04,209
that people do run

546
00:20:01,570 --> 00:20:06,760
I saw dat and she's not quite sure what

547
00:20:04,210 --> 00:20:08,950
she can do now and then last but not

548
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:11,140
least Kevin the red teamer you know he

549
00:20:08,950 --> 00:20:13,930
did his tests he tested tasklist

550
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:14,950
PS and all the alerts fired for the

551
00:20:13,930 --> 00:20:17,410
defenders

552
00:20:14,950 --> 00:20:19,540
I wasn't that kind of the point well he

553
00:20:17,410 --> 00:20:22,060
didn't test beyond those to detection z'

554
00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:24,460
those two procedures and then he also

555
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:27,940
didn't work with the blue team he just

556
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:30,100
kind of hit it over PS lewis PS and task

557
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:32,440
list and they got all those alerts and

558
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:33,550
then he just let it go he thought maybe

559
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:34,750
there was an issue maybe there's

560
00:20:33,550 --> 00:20:36,639
something more they needed to do but

561
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:40,210
didn't follow up didn't work with a blue

562
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:41,440
team to drive improvements so let's work

563
00:20:40,210 --> 00:20:43,030
on getting through all play back on

564
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:44,770
track and for those of you who don't

565
00:20:43,030 --> 00:20:47,560
work for awfully which hopefully is none

566
00:20:44,770 --> 00:20:49,060
of you for trademark issues just put

567
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:52,270
yourself in the shoes of roughly as we

568
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:56,230
go through these different personas so

569
00:20:52,270 --> 00:20:58,840
how can a CSO CEO a team lead a manager

570
00:20:56,230 --> 00:21:01,750
better understand their risk using

571
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:03,250
attack to me risk it's all about kind of

572
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:05,080
knowing what your threats are where

573
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:06,850
you're vulnerable where those gaps are

574
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:08,649
and as a lead that should be one of your

575
00:21:06,850 --> 00:21:10,990
main concerns how can attack help you

576
00:21:08,650 --> 00:21:14,230
there and what can grace kind of get out

577
00:21:10,990 --> 00:21:16,090
of attack first thing to do

578
00:21:14,230 --> 00:21:19,150
we recommend communicating in confidence

579
00:21:16,090 --> 00:21:21,459
levels so in the traditional Intel side

580
00:21:19,150 --> 00:21:25,030
we talked a lot about communicating

581
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:27,220
confidence words of uncertainty if I say

582
00:21:25,030 --> 00:21:30,160
I'm almost certain it's very different

583
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:32,710
than if I say likely and we need to do

584
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:34,330
that with detections as well so that's

585
00:21:32,710 --> 00:21:36,010
really where the team went wrong early

586
00:21:34,330 --> 00:21:38,710
on you know they said we're green we're

587
00:21:36,010 --> 00:21:41,170
good to go we're a hundred percent but

588
00:21:38,710 --> 00:21:42,610
you can never be that confident so we

589
00:21:41,170 --> 00:21:46,000
recommend instead of that stoplight

590
00:21:42,610 --> 00:21:47,770
chart that red yellow and green it can

591
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:50,380
be easy for execs to understand that

592
00:21:47,770 --> 00:21:52,420
maybe it's a little bit misleading maybe

593
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:53,920
a better way to do it and the hats up to

594
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:56,920
our friend Olaf who recommended this as

595
00:21:53,920 --> 00:22:00,100
well use a single color use darker and

596
00:21:56,920 --> 00:22:02,080
lighter shades so here if we haven't no

597
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:04,000
detection we're not at all confident

598
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:06,820
that we would detect that technique give

599
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:09,610
it a zero it swipes if we're very

600
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:11,620
confident it's highly likely that we

601
00:22:09,610 --> 00:22:13,169
would detect a certain technique let's

602
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:16,379
give that a five

603
00:22:13,170 --> 00:22:18,510
but even when there's a five that

604
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:20,550
doesn't mean we're done and a shout-out

605
00:22:18,510 --> 00:22:22,530
to Kyle Rainey who wrote our blog on

606
00:22:20,550 --> 00:22:25,260
this from red canary as well we're never

607
00:22:22,530 --> 00:22:27,180
really done adversaries are always

608
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:29,340
changing we're always gonna have to be

609
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:31,080
keeping up writing new detections so

610
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:33,840
just realizing it's a range of

611
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:36,149
confidence levels but a five doesn't

612
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:39,090
mean you're 100% covered doesn't mean

613
00:22:36,150 --> 00:22:41,340
you're done the other thing that grace

614
00:22:39,090 --> 00:22:44,070
or a lead can help drive is integration

615
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:46,159
of different teams we talked about

616
00:22:44,070 --> 00:22:48,149
attack as a common language and

617
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:50,310
different teams can use it to

618
00:22:48,150 --> 00:22:52,230
communicate with each other so think of

619
00:22:50,310 --> 00:22:55,800
our three teams in the situation red

620
00:22:52,230 --> 00:22:58,080
team CTI and defenders each of those

621
00:22:55,800 --> 00:23:01,440
teams has something that the others

622
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:03,480
needs very hungergames s whether it's an

623
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:05,400
understanding of threats whether it's

624
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:07,860
what detection they're seeing of actual

625
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:10,500
threats or what gaps from the red team

626
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:12,899
perspective attack can be that common

627
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:14,610
language but those three teams are even

628
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:16,890
more teams within a sock within the

629
00:23:14,610 --> 00:23:20,219
network defense organization can use to

630
00:23:16,890 --> 00:23:21,960
communicate back and forth they also can

631
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:23,760
use attack to communicate up to their

632
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:26,640
lead to their executive about an

633
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:28,379
understanding of risk using that

634
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:30,450
framework that common language of attack

635
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:32,430
you can start to map out where our

636
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:35,400
threats what behaviors are they're using

637
00:23:32,430 --> 00:23:39,330
and then where are those gaps and to me

638
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:40,650
that's what risk is all about and as you

639
00:23:39,330 --> 00:23:42,360
go through this process you saw how

640
00:23:40,650 --> 00:23:44,280
Frawley started with email and I'm

641
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:45,870
almost positive that found 90% of the

642
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:48,030
people in the audience's are going to

643
00:23:45,870 --> 00:23:50,100
start with attack and communicating

644
00:23:48,030 --> 00:23:52,470
across teams that's a wonderful way to

645
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:53,760
do it you start it there right start

646
00:23:52,470 --> 00:23:54,990
with the email setting things back and

647
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:57,180
forth and then you move to something

648
00:23:54,990 --> 00:23:58,800
like Excel which I personally hate but

649
00:23:57,180 --> 00:24:00,600
seeing people in the CTI industry seem

650
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:02,190
to absolutely love it we're gonna move

651
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:03,600
on from there though if you use

652
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:05,550
something like a cell you can do a

653
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:07,169
collaborative on it you can track

654
00:24:05,550 --> 00:24:09,210
different groups you can see where the

655
00:24:07,170 --> 00:24:11,370
were there gaps in your network are you

656
00:24:09,210 --> 00:24:13,320
can write macros to have shades of blue

657
00:24:11,370 --> 00:24:15,810
all over the place and this is a really

658
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:17,820
really effective way of using attack to

659
00:24:15,810 --> 00:24:19,110
collaborate across these teams which the

660
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:20,520
other great thing about this is it's

661
00:24:19,110 --> 00:24:21,570
relatively cheap you don't have to do a

662
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:23,220
lot of work you just have to have

663
00:24:21,570 --> 00:24:26,010
someone who understands how to do macros

664
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:26,760
and formulas in Excel so you're good to

665
00:24:26,010 --> 00:24:28,410
go

666
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:30,360
when you're ready to accelerate past

667
00:24:28,410 --> 00:24:31,770
that you go into something that's a

668
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:33,928
little bit more automated you find a

669
00:24:31,770 --> 00:24:35,429
tool that has an API you find something

670
00:24:33,929 --> 00:24:37,290
that all the different teams can write

671
00:24:35,429 --> 00:24:39,750
tooling in to communicate across and

672
00:24:37,290 --> 00:24:42,059
update each other automatically and in

673
00:24:39,750 --> 00:24:43,320
real time as they go through we look

674
00:24:42,059 --> 00:24:46,379
back to this slide you'll notice there's

675
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:47,820
a triangle there and one thing I love

676
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:50,160
about attack that I don't see a lot of

677
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:52,320
people understanding is you can come in

678
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:54,780
any part of these personas right

679
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:57,210
attacker or the red team or the blue

680
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:59,370
team the CTI analysts or even the

681
00:24:57,210 --> 00:25:01,110
executive each person has a way to jump

682
00:24:59,370 --> 00:25:02,668
in and add value and get what they need

683
00:25:01,110 --> 00:25:04,709
out of it and when you're using an

684
00:25:02,669 --> 00:25:06,540
automated tool something like JIRA where

685
00:25:04,710 --> 00:25:08,070
it turns into just a nice loop as people

686
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:10,260
are kind of adding and putting things in

687
00:25:08,070 --> 00:25:13,110
you really embrace that methodology and

688
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:15,390
everyone can get use out of the tool as

689
00:25:13,110 --> 00:25:17,309
spunk we wrote something good friend of

690
00:25:15,390 --> 00:25:19,169
mine David Verve and Johan wrote this is

691
00:25:17,309 --> 00:25:21,840
a miter attack matrix that's generated

692
00:25:19,169 --> 00:25:23,070
off the data inside of your sim and what

693
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:25,649
I can show you is a whole bunch of

694
00:25:23,070 --> 00:25:27,480
information so using olaf's of blue once

695
00:25:25,650 --> 00:25:29,250
again you can see if it's dark blue that

696
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:31,140
means we have high confidence that we

697
00:25:29,250 --> 00:25:33,440
not only have the data in our system to

698
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:35,760
detect things but we also have

699
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:38,490
signatures or similar in there to

700
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:39,840
actually detect off that data we do a

701
00:25:38,490 --> 00:25:41,790
little bit of a close up here you can

702
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:42,899
see the little red little red icon up

703
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:45,210
there that means we're actually looking

704
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:47,190
at an oil rig TPP because we filtered by

705
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:49,049
that we can see the different TTP's

706
00:25:47,190 --> 00:25:50,640
available the signatures and the data

707
00:25:49,049 --> 00:25:53,220
that's available and this is really

708
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:54,990
valuable you can really go through your

709
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:56,850
data find where your gaps are find what

710
00:25:54,990 --> 00:25:58,080
adversaries you're interested in and

711
00:25:56,850 --> 00:26:01,918
it's all just using the backend

712
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:04,530
information in your sim next up moving

713
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:06,510
on to the threat Intel team how can they

714
00:26:04,530 --> 00:26:08,639
use attack to action new threats to

715
00:26:06,510 --> 00:26:09,990
bring in you know whatever adversary is

716
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:12,750
the adversary of the day whatever's

717
00:26:09,990 --> 00:26:17,340
compromised their org track on that new

718
00:26:12,750 --> 00:26:19,260
threat using attack attack has a lot of

719
00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:21,480
different techniques we have 244 and

720
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:24,540
enterprise attack our team works

721
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:25,950
constantly to try to update that we're

722
00:26:24,540 --> 00:26:28,200
never going to have everything

723
00:26:25,950 --> 00:26:30,270
adversaries are doing an attack we're

724
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:32,160
just not and we've chosen kind of a

725
00:26:30,270 --> 00:26:35,309
specific methodology of what we intend

726
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:37,590
to focus on so it's fine if you want to

727
00:26:35,309 --> 00:26:40,190
add on to it I'm on our website we have

728
00:26:37,590 --> 00:26:42,590
a lot of examples of groups and software

729
00:26:40,190 --> 00:26:44,840
we pull those I work with a team to map

730
00:26:42,590 --> 00:26:46,850
those open source blog posts many of you

731
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:48,860
have written to attacked but that's just

732
00:26:46,850 --> 00:26:50,600
a sampling what's out there not

733
00:26:48,860 --> 00:26:53,570
everything is an open source nor should

734
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:55,370
it be so you and your own team your own

735
00:26:53,570 --> 00:26:58,309
CTI analysts and incident responders

736
00:26:55,370 --> 00:27:00,080
will have your own data map that and

737
00:26:58,309 --> 00:27:03,980
start to build out your own threat

738
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:05,029
library of data map to attack so

739
00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:07,220
throughout this presentation we

740
00:27:05,029 --> 00:27:09,470
mentioned that the examples we give are

741
00:27:07,220 --> 00:27:11,330
inspired by real organizations in this

742
00:27:09,470 --> 00:27:13,220
section we wanted to bring you real

743
00:27:11,330 --> 00:27:15,710
examples from a real organization

744
00:27:13,220 --> 00:27:17,120
Deloitte was kind enough to let me share

745
00:27:15,710 --> 00:27:18,679
with you what they've been doing to

746
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:21,830
build out their own threat library

747
00:27:18,679 --> 00:27:24,110
pretty cool so what they do is they have

748
00:27:21,830 --> 00:27:26,120
different groups different software

749
00:27:24,110 --> 00:27:27,918
pages campaigns incident that they've

750
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:30,229
mapped to different techniques so here's

751
00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:31,940
an example car cough a back door they

752
00:27:30,230 --> 00:27:33,620
have a description and then they list

753
00:27:31,940 --> 00:27:39,169
different techniques and what campaign

754
00:27:33,620 --> 00:27:40,668
is associated with what they can do is

755
00:27:39,169 --> 00:27:43,250
as they start gathering this data over

756
00:27:40,669 --> 00:27:46,220
time start to aggregate what are the

757
00:27:43,250 --> 00:27:48,620
most commonly used techniques for the

758
00:27:46,220 --> 00:27:50,690
adversaries they care about it's

759
00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:52,370
important to emphasize that no data

760
00:27:50,690 --> 00:27:55,370
that's going to be perfect every data

761
00:27:52,370 --> 00:27:56,149
set has bias but it can give you a place

762
00:27:55,370 --> 00:27:58,668
to start

763
00:27:56,149 --> 00:28:01,850
again 244 techniques and enterprise

764
00:27:58,669 --> 00:28:05,149
attack kind of a lot but over a sampling

765
00:28:01,850 --> 00:28:07,428
of 2019 dates they have these top 14

766
00:28:05,149 --> 00:28:08,899
techniques that were most common amongst

767
00:28:07,429 --> 00:28:11,779
the threats they care about in their

768
00:28:08,899 --> 00:28:13,279
library so a great place to start if

769
00:28:11,779 --> 00:28:17,480
you're looking to pass the defenders

770
00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:19,129
make that threat informed defense the

771
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:21,169
other thing you can do is build on

772
00:28:19,129 --> 00:28:23,509
attack again we take a very specific

773
00:28:21,169 --> 00:28:25,789
approach we've out laid out our

774
00:28:23,509 --> 00:28:27,200
methodology and you have different

775
00:28:25,789 --> 00:28:28,908
threats you might have different use

776
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:31,159
cases different requirements so it's

777
00:28:28,909 --> 00:28:34,039
perfectly fine to take the attack

778
00:28:31,159 --> 00:28:37,070
methodology and make your own build on

779
00:28:34,039 --> 00:28:38,840
it add to it so you might have noticed

780
00:28:37,070 --> 00:28:40,850
in that car cock page from the Deloitte

781
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:45,049
team there are these different

782
00:28:40,850 --> 00:28:46,519
techniques here D TTT and then T 1001

783
00:28:45,049 --> 00:28:49,668
which is kind of a traditional attack

784
00:28:46,519 --> 00:28:51,409
technique ID format so what the Deloitte

785
00:28:49,669 --> 00:28:52,050
team has done is they've said cool we're

786
00:28:51,409 --> 00:28:53,730
going to use the

787
00:28:52,050 --> 00:28:55,740
attack techniques those traditional

788
00:28:53,730 --> 00:28:57,540
technique ideas but then there are some

789
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:59,580
techniques that we care about tracking

790
00:28:57,540 --> 00:29:01,920
that aren't in attack let's give those

791
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:03,360
an internal ID and let's use those to

792
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:06,410
track our threats because we care about

793
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:09,330
those even though they're not an attack

794
00:29:06,410 --> 00:29:12,030
so one example of those one of those

795
00:29:09,330 --> 00:29:15,149
techniques DNS tunneling adversaries

796
00:29:12,030 --> 00:29:17,580
might use SSH HTTP and tunnel that over

797
00:29:15,150 --> 00:29:19,020
DNS so this was something that they felt

798
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:21,570
like they wanted to track for threats

799
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:23,490
they care about and so they mapped it

800
00:29:21,570 --> 00:29:25,139
back to kind of the broader attack

801
00:29:23,490 --> 00:29:27,750
technique custom command and control

802
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:29,040
protocol to help build that common

803
00:29:27,750 --> 00:29:31,170
language that they're talking to others

804
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:34,170
but for their use case they wanted a

805
00:29:31,170 --> 00:29:36,060
more granular sub technique now I should

806
00:29:34,170 --> 00:29:37,830
mention right now sub techniques are

807
00:29:36,060 --> 00:29:39,540
just something Deloitte's doing but the

808
00:29:37,830 --> 00:29:41,159
attack team is working to add sub

809
00:29:39,540 --> 00:29:43,440
techniques into the entire framework

810
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:44,940
Blake Jamie others have been kind of

811
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:47,450
furiously working on this trying to

812
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:49,620
figure out how do we add that other

813
00:29:47,450 --> 00:29:52,050
granularity level for people who care

814
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:55,020
about that sub technique level so look

815
00:29:52,050 --> 00:29:57,480
for that in coming months another

816
00:29:55,020 --> 00:29:59,490
technique example timing based evasion I

817
00:29:57,480 --> 00:30:01,770
mean malware only runs in certain

818
00:29:59,490 --> 00:30:04,980
conditions at certain times the deloitte

819
00:30:01,770 --> 00:30:07,290
team added that technique and then later

820
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:08,820
we as the attack team realized well that

821
00:30:07,290 --> 00:30:11,520
was kind of a gap we needed to fill in

822
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:14,820
the framework so added virtualization or

823
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:16,290
sandbox evasion so the team said pool we

824
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:19,260
had that original technique we just

825
00:30:16,290 --> 00:30:20,460
deprecated it so if you find yourself in

826
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:22,470
this situation where maybe there's a

827
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:24,300
technique not an attack please reach out

828
00:30:22,470 --> 00:30:26,010
our email address is on the last slide

829
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:28,320
if it doesn't quite fit in our

830
00:30:26,010 --> 00:30:28,860
methodology which happens sometimes no

831
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:31,620
worries

832
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:34,620
add it to your own internal repo use it

833
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:36,419
for your threat use cases and you know

834
00:30:34,620 --> 00:30:38,489
the key here is just that attack has a

835
00:30:36,420 --> 00:30:42,980
lot but not everything so it's perfectly

836
00:30:38,490 --> 00:30:42,980
fine to take that methodology add to it

837
00:30:43,430 --> 00:30:49,020
how can a blue team or the blue team er

838
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:50,700
know what is detected and if they have

839
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:52,020
the right data to do it right how can

840
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:53,940
they actually make sure of this and this

841
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:55,620
is an ongoing problem if there's one

842
00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:57,540
problem I've seen people have with

843
00:30:55,620 --> 00:31:00,729
attack from a blue team a network

844
00:30:57,540 --> 00:31:02,470
plumber point of view this is really it

845
00:31:00,730 --> 00:31:04,750
what we're going to talk about here is

846
00:31:02,470 --> 00:31:06,550
mapping data to your TTP so I showed you

847
00:31:04,750 --> 00:31:08,200
a brief example of it earlier where we

848
00:31:06,550 --> 00:31:10,389
actually use some data introspection to

849
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:12,160
make that happen but this is something

850
00:31:10,390 --> 00:31:13,630
that can be done with pen and paper this

851
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:15,310
has to be done automatically with

852
00:31:13,630 --> 00:31:16,720
tooling this can be done on a white

853
00:31:15,310 --> 00:31:18,090
board a lot of different options here

854
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:20,500
but it is critical to your success

855
00:31:18,090 --> 00:31:22,810
mapping your network analytic tools a

856
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:24,430
tooling in your sock to the miter attack

857
00:31:22,810 --> 00:31:26,980
framework for this better use also

858
00:31:24,430 --> 00:31:28,900
Settlers of Catan best game ever that's

859
00:31:26,980 --> 00:31:30,550
game ever avoiding a lot of jokes there

860
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:33,340
but we'll go through it we talked

861
00:31:30,550 --> 00:31:34,930
earlier about t10 five seven process

862
00:31:33,340 --> 00:31:38,379
monitoring and process command-line

863
00:31:34,930 --> 00:31:41,070
parameters these are really great ways

864
00:31:38,380 --> 00:31:43,300
to detect adversaries but they're very

865
00:31:41,070 --> 00:31:44,350
they're not exactly specific right

866
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:46,300
there's a lot of things that are going

867
00:31:44,350 --> 00:31:48,879
to come up here that is legitimate

868
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:51,070
traffic that's legitimate use or if you

869
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:53,980
just look for task list Exe and the

870
00:31:51,070 --> 00:31:55,870
adversary changes it to task list a dot

871
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:57,760
you see the alerts that we wrote earlier

872
00:31:55,870 --> 00:31:59,979
are completely gone they're completely

873
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:02,020
worthless and those data sources are

874
00:31:59,980 --> 00:32:04,090
meant to be high-level I'm actually in

875
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:05,680
coming months another item on our

876
00:32:04,090 --> 00:32:07,149
ever-growing list of things to do is

877
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:08,620
kind of refactoring those data sources

878
00:32:07,150 --> 00:32:10,810
trying to figure out other ones we

879
00:32:08,620 --> 00:32:12,909
should add so some folks in the audience

880
00:32:10,810 --> 00:32:14,409
are helping out with that if you have

881
00:32:12,910 --> 00:32:16,450
data sources you feel like are missing

882
00:32:14,410 --> 00:32:19,330
please reach out let us know because we

883
00:32:16,450 --> 00:32:20,650
try to make that useful for folks so we

884
00:32:19,330 --> 00:32:22,510
showed you you know one example just

885
00:32:20,650 --> 00:32:24,280
looking at a single technique those data

886
00:32:22,510 --> 00:32:26,350
sources on the right do you want to pull

887
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:27,670
that at scale for all the techniques we

888
00:32:26,350 --> 00:32:30,159
have a couple helper scripts that are

889
00:32:27,670 --> 00:32:31,960
awesome infrastructure team created

890
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:35,170
it'll help you out pull the sticks

891
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:36,700
objects for all of the different data

892
00:32:35,170 --> 00:32:38,770
sources for different techniques that

893
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:40,150
can help you get started but there's

894
00:32:38,770 --> 00:32:42,820
also a wide variety of open source

895
00:32:40,150 --> 00:32:45,100
projects there are literally so many we

896
00:32:42,820 --> 00:32:47,500
can't necessarily endorse any specific

897
00:32:45,100 --> 00:32:49,389
one we do love Olaf so that one comes up

898
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:51,220
on the top left but there's a lot of

899
00:32:49,390 --> 00:32:53,110
different ways to do this if you're

900
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:55,630
looking at something like how do I find

901
00:32:53,110 --> 00:32:56,740
process command line execution these are

902
00:32:55,630 --> 00:32:58,630
where you're gonna say like oh are you

903
00:32:56,740 --> 00:33:00,880
running OS query if you're running

904
00:32:58,630 --> 00:33:03,100
Windows have you enabled four six eight

905
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:05,500
eight with full command line logging or

906
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:07,149
do you have system on do you have system

907
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:08,290
on line configure to actually pull that

908
00:33:07,150 --> 00:33:10,000
back these are the sort of things

909
00:33:08,290 --> 00:33:11,530
they'll hopefully find that information

910
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:13,180
for you

911
00:33:11,530 --> 00:33:14,710
and once again this is where I'm gonna

912
00:33:13,180 --> 00:33:16,660
take that kind of a step out usually I'm

913
00:33:14,710 --> 00:33:18,400
pretty neutral about this but frankly if

914
00:33:16,660 --> 00:33:21,520
you have a vendor and you're paying them

915
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:23,800
money for their software and you want to

916
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:25,990
use a tack talk to your vendor see what

917
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:27,490
they have for it or force them to it we

918
00:33:25,990 --> 00:33:29,230
as a vendor have responded because our

919
00:33:27,490 --> 00:33:30,640
customers have wanted attack in our

920
00:33:29,230 --> 00:33:32,800
product this is something that we feel

921
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:34,600
passionate about our customers wanted it

922
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:36,190
so we started implementing it find out

923
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:37,689
what your vendors are doing this is an

924
00:33:36,190 --> 00:33:39,550
example exactly what we talked about

925
00:33:37,690 --> 00:33:41,520
here we're doing more data introspection

926
00:33:39,550 --> 00:33:43,540
to try to map to tactics and techniques

927
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:45,340
and we've also created some fun

928
00:33:43,540 --> 00:33:47,110
visualizations like I said you might do

929
00:33:45,340 --> 00:33:49,149
this on a whiteboard but all we're doing

930
00:33:47,110 --> 00:33:51,610
here is trying to see what the technique

931
00:33:49,150 --> 00:33:53,620
is do we have data to map it and where

932
00:33:51,610 --> 00:33:56,169
is it all coming through right however

933
00:33:53,620 --> 00:33:59,560
you choose to do this do it that's

934
00:33:56,170 --> 00:34:01,510
really the takeaway here on the defender

935
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:04,210
side also really important to remember

936
00:34:01,510 --> 00:34:06,520
as we mentioned a signal single

937
00:34:04,210 --> 00:34:08,260
signature detection analytic doesn't

938
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:10,210
mean you're completely covered for that

939
00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:13,540
technique so we talked about with that

940
00:34:10,210 --> 00:34:15,460
green means 100% you're never gonna get

941
00:34:13,540 --> 00:34:16,840
there so you've got to look for multiple

942
00:34:15,460 --> 00:34:20,110
different what we call behavioral

943
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:22,629
analytics things like seeing task list

944
00:34:20,110 --> 00:34:24,580
run is a very simple one they can get

945
00:34:22,629 --> 00:34:26,500
more complex and the great news is that

946
00:34:24,580 --> 00:34:28,120
there are a lot of repos out there that

947
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:30,760
have these analytics so you can pull

948
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:33,250
from one of them the cyber analytics

949
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:36,220
repository car is maintained by a team

950
00:34:33,250 --> 00:34:38,230
at mitre that I work with will be honest

951
00:34:36,219 --> 00:34:40,178
Carr was a little bit a dormant shall we

952
00:34:38,230 --> 00:34:42,129
say for a couple years but it's been

953
00:34:40,179 --> 00:34:44,020
reinvigorated recently we added some new

954
00:34:42,129 --> 00:34:46,360
analytics also looking for contributions

955
00:34:44,020 --> 00:34:48,759
do you have an analytic that you think

956
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:51,850
should be added not to attack send it to

957
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:52,270
us let us know we are not the only game

958
00:34:51,850 --> 00:34:54,819
in town

959
00:34:52,270 --> 00:34:57,580
Ross whoops in the audience from endgame

960
00:34:54,820 --> 00:34:59,110
works on this equal library equals a

961
00:34:57,580 --> 00:35:00,940
language you can use to express

962
00:34:59,110 --> 00:35:03,460
analytics and they have a great library

963
00:35:00,940 --> 00:35:06,280
of analytics mapped to attack that you

964
00:35:03,460 --> 00:35:07,660
can also use to pull from the key here

965
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:09,970
you know regardless of what language you

966
00:35:07,660 --> 00:35:11,500
use which ones we all have different

967
00:35:09,970 --> 00:35:14,410
data sets different perspective

968
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:16,090
different detection ideas so look at all

969
00:35:14,410 --> 00:35:18,500
of these repos as we're trying to write

970
00:35:16,090 --> 00:35:21,829
behavioral analytics meant to attack

971
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:23,869
another idea the ever impressive Florian

972
00:35:21,829 --> 00:35:26,000
Roth has the signal where they've

973
00:35:23,869 --> 00:35:27,770
actually created generics and rules and

974
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:29,810
you can export that out to your sim or

975
00:35:27,770 --> 00:35:31,640
analytic platform of choice and now

976
00:35:29,810 --> 00:35:33,828
that's actually mostly math I believe to

977
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:36,859
attack so that's a phenomenal resource

978
00:35:33,829 --> 00:35:38,569
as well and one other thing I want to

979
00:35:36,859 --> 00:35:40,460
talk to you this was really highlighted

980
00:35:38,569 --> 00:35:42,319
to me last year at the miter attack on

981
00:35:40,460 --> 00:35:43,790
by the the folks over at red canary

982
00:35:42,319 --> 00:35:45,740
where they talked about some of the five

983
00:35:43,790 --> 00:35:48,529
pitfalls that they've seen with attack

984
00:35:45,740 --> 00:35:51,290
and one that I see customers constantly

985
00:35:48,530 --> 00:35:54,319
doing is they see a technique and they

986
00:35:51,290 --> 00:35:56,180
write a search they see a technique and

987
00:35:54,319 --> 00:35:58,910
they write a search they just go

988
00:35:56,180 --> 00:36:00,440
straight down right and frankly some of

989
00:35:58,910 --> 00:36:02,000
those techniques are very broad you

990
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:04,099
might be trying to write a search for

991
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:07,069
like common protocol usage and that's

992
00:36:04,099 --> 00:36:09,170
pretty hard or RDP that's not going to

993
00:36:07,069 --> 00:36:10,579
be super useful or you're going to get

994
00:36:09,170 --> 00:36:12,200
overwhelmed with alerts because now you

995
00:36:10,579 --> 00:36:13,369
have a lot of false positives or you

996
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:15,618
have a lot of things kicking off that

997
00:36:13,369 --> 00:36:17,480
you never attended I really recommend

998
00:36:15,619 --> 00:36:19,069
and this is a screenshot of a sample

999
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:21,490
search that we have that actually does

1000
00:36:19,069 --> 00:36:25,099
this instead of looking at that atomic

1001
00:36:21,490 --> 00:36:27,259
indicator that that pasla CSV or that

1002
00:36:25,099 --> 00:36:28,819
hash consider looking at something much

1003
00:36:27,260 --> 00:36:31,520
more representative of what the approach

1004
00:36:28,819 --> 00:36:33,800
is by that adversary or by that

1005
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:35,300
technique right or attack technique so

1006
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:37,880
in this case instead of looking for a

1007
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:39,980
process that's executed named task list

1008
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:41,480
that's doing process discovery what

1009
00:36:39,980 --> 00:36:43,640
we're saying is hey that's probably not

1010
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:45,079
run that often like I don't know how

1011
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:46,400
many times you guys were in PS on your

1012
00:36:45,079 --> 00:36:49,520
laptop but it's probably a lot less than

1013
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:51,290
VI at least for me that's going to show

1014
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:52,460
up at a ray or executable because it's

1015
00:36:51,290 --> 00:36:54,319
an executable and it's going to go

1016
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:56,300
across any system or any platform

1017
00:36:54,319 --> 00:36:59,960
however you bring that in and this maps

1018
00:36:56,300 --> 00:37:01,790
to t105 seven for our platform but the

1019
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:03,260
reality is that's going to map across a

1020
00:37:01,790 --> 00:37:05,720
lot of different techniques and tactics

1021
00:37:03,260 --> 00:37:07,430
within miter attack so that one search

1022
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:09,828
actually is double triple quadruple

1023
00:37:07,430 --> 00:37:12,049
hitting in terms of giving coverage and

1024
00:37:09,829 --> 00:37:13,579
then have that roll into your analytics

1025
00:37:12,050 --> 00:37:14,990
platform you want to be able to be

1026
00:37:13,579 --> 00:37:16,880
researching you wanted to be able to do

1027
00:37:14,990 --> 00:37:20,118
reports later on to show hey after a

1028
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:21,710
year of adopting mitre attacks what

1029
00:37:20,119 --> 00:37:24,230
techniques are we catching primarily

1030
00:37:21,710 --> 00:37:26,180
where are gaps where we actually had

1031
00:37:24,230 --> 00:37:27,859
incidents where we started up an

1032
00:37:26,180 --> 00:37:29,629
incident in afterwards and then we did

1033
00:37:27,859 --> 00:37:32,650
the the hot wash and we found out that

1034
00:37:29,630 --> 00:37:34,990
we had no detection for this technique

1035
00:37:32,650 --> 00:37:37,060
but we thought we did or we didn't have

1036
00:37:34,990 --> 00:37:39,040
that in once again push your vendor push

1037
00:37:37,060 --> 00:37:40,990
your sim push whomever it is to start

1038
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:42,640
integrating this taxonomy does your any

1039
00:37:40,990 --> 00:37:44,410
here that word for me over and over over

1040
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:46,089
again its taxonomy it's a shared

1041
00:37:44,410 --> 00:37:48,460
language where we can discuss this and

1042
00:37:46,090 --> 00:37:51,630
have representable repeatable results

1043
00:37:48,460 --> 00:37:53,770
that we can metro size and analyze and

1044
00:37:51,630 --> 00:37:55,840
the result of that is hopefully you're

1045
00:37:53,770 --> 00:37:57,340
gonna have a lot less result or alerts

1046
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:59,110
you're going to have reduce alerts as

1047
00:37:57,340 --> 00:38:01,770
this kind of goes through as you start

1048
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:03,940
bubbling things up through this process

1049
00:38:01,770 --> 00:38:06,370
which really ties into the next part

1050
00:38:03,940 --> 00:38:09,070
which is how can a red teamer help this

1051
00:38:06,370 --> 00:38:11,049
defense katie talked earlier about

1052
00:38:09,070 --> 00:38:12,970
Deloitte and how they've modified the

1053
00:38:11,050 --> 00:38:15,310
mitre attack team with their own

1054
00:38:12,970 --> 00:38:17,279
nomenclature I love that I think that's

1055
00:38:15,310 --> 00:38:19,840
the biggest advantage to the mitre

1056
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:22,000
framework because it is open source it

1057
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:23,920
is free it is giving you the world don't

1058
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:26,260
don't hold back just because it isn't in

1059
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:28,690
that matrix extend it expand it make it

1060
00:38:26,260 --> 00:38:29,260
yours and this applies as well for the

1061
00:38:28,690 --> 00:38:31,750
red team

1062
00:38:29,260 --> 00:38:33,430
I love atomic red team we use it all the

1063
00:38:31,750 --> 00:38:35,350
time to test things and run through

1064
00:38:33,430 --> 00:38:36,730
things but it does not have everything

1065
00:38:35,350 --> 00:38:38,950
it's not always a hundred percent

1066
00:38:36,730 --> 00:38:40,930
suitable for your environment keep the

1067
00:38:38,950 --> 00:38:43,089
idea though keep that taxonomy and just

1068
00:38:40,930 --> 00:38:44,830
expand on so just like they have an

1069
00:38:43,090 --> 00:38:47,500
atomic red team a little bit fuzzy up

1070
00:38:44,830 --> 00:38:49,660
there but it says t10 five seven is a

1071
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:52,450
detection add a nomenclature on there

1072
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:55,359
for your own internal org of t105 7 -

1073
00:38:52,450 --> 00:38:58,270
f/4 frothy or dtt for Deloitte whatever

1074
00:38:55,360 --> 00:39:00,760
be that's you know theme that we keep

1075
00:38:58,270 --> 00:39:02,200
coming back to is just because you add

1076
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:04,000
on to something doesn't mean you don't

1077
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:04,779
think it's awesome like attack can be

1078
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,610
incredibly useful

1079
00:39:04,780 --> 00:39:08,920
Tomica red team is awesome Casey Smith's

1080
00:39:06,610 --> 00:39:11,740
in the audience shout out to him but add

1081
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:14,440
to it we each have our own use cases our

1082
00:39:11,740 --> 00:39:16,089
own requirements so it's totally fine to

1083
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:17,440
add your own internal techniques like

1084
00:39:16,090 --> 00:39:19,090
Deloitte did I'm sure

1085
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:20,950
red Canary would say it's totally fine

1086
00:39:19,090 --> 00:39:24,580
to add your own atomic tests as well

1087
00:39:20,950 --> 00:39:26,710
locally all about finding different ways

1088
00:39:24,580 --> 00:39:28,660
to test those procedures so we talked

1089
00:39:26,710 --> 00:39:30,490
about you know task list is one way a

1090
00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:34,089
red teamer could test process discovery

1091
00:39:30,490 --> 00:39:36,220
another way using API calls shout-out to

1092
00:39:34,090 --> 00:39:37,510
my red team friends Jamie and Mike who

1093
00:39:36,220 --> 00:39:38,770
were like yeah we love to do this

1094
00:39:37,510 --> 00:39:42,300
because everyone's looking for a

1095
00:39:38,770 --> 00:39:45,460
command-line task list not at API calls

1096
00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:46,170
and I love that example because I don't

1097
00:39:45,460 --> 00:39:48,900
actually know

1098
00:39:46,170 --> 00:39:49,410
how to log or detect an API call as a

1099
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:51,329
blue Timur

1100
00:39:49,410 --> 00:39:54,118
I literally can't brought this up and I

1101
00:39:51,329 --> 00:39:57,180
wouldn't yeah but you could but wouldn't

1102
00:39:54,119 --> 00:39:58,799
that be I have no clue so this is a

1103
00:39:57,180 --> 00:40:00,569
chance for red team and blue team to sit

1104
00:39:58,799 --> 00:40:02,460
together where they've actually created

1105
00:40:00,569 --> 00:40:04,470
a new method it's not an attack it's on

1106
00:40:02,460 --> 00:40:06,750
any of the TTP's I've never heard of it

1107
00:40:04,470 --> 00:40:08,339
start doing the testing run through the

1108
00:40:06,750 --> 00:40:10,829
logging and find out if there is a way

1109
00:40:08,339 --> 00:40:12,750
to actually find that a PA API call and

1110
00:40:10,829 --> 00:40:14,730
add that into your defenses right so you

1111
00:40:12,750 --> 00:40:16,200
move from red and blue and kind of meet

1112
00:40:14,730 --> 00:40:17,670
in the middle and purple and really

1113
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:20,669
expand your defenses and make them solid

1114
00:40:17,670 --> 00:40:23,730
and here's just a visualization of that

1115
00:40:20,670 --> 00:40:25,920
using the attack navigator again the red

1116
00:40:23,730 --> 00:40:28,589
team goes in does their operations and

1117
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:31,440
the techniques out of that defenders

1118
00:40:28,589 --> 00:40:34,500
were able to detect make those blue cool

1119
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:36,599
maybe we got those the techniques they

1120
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:38,220
couldn't detect the ones the red teamers

1121
00:40:36,599 --> 00:40:41,220
did that the booty murmurs couldn't find

1122
00:40:38,220 --> 00:40:43,529
make those red don't stop they're moving

1123
00:40:41,220 --> 00:40:45,569
towards purple teaming so the point of

1124
00:40:43,529 --> 00:40:48,510
red teaming is to help defenses get

1125
00:40:45,569 --> 00:40:50,880
stronger so red teamers don't stop there

1126
00:40:48,510 --> 00:40:53,849
help the blue team figure out how to

1127
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:56,609
turn those red ones into blue driving

1128
00:40:53,849 --> 00:40:58,980
those defenses using attack and fun

1129
00:40:56,609 --> 00:41:01,078
story actually a series of red team blue

1130
00:40:58,980 --> 00:41:04,289
team exercises a mitre that was actually

1131
00:41:01,079 --> 00:41:06,450
how attack was created the team found

1132
00:41:04,289 --> 00:41:09,000
that they couldn't really communicate in

1133
00:41:06,450 --> 00:41:10,680
enough detail about exactly what was

1134
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:13,049
being done in those red team operations

1135
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:15,029
back to the blue team so attack was born

1136
00:41:13,049 --> 00:41:16,799
out of that and that same kind of purple

1137
00:41:15,029 --> 00:41:22,160
team feel another great use case for

1138
00:41:16,799 --> 00:41:25,109
attack another one combine your powers

1139
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:27,058
Captain Planet huge Captain Planet fan

1140
00:41:25,109 --> 00:41:29,970
will throw that cartoon there for you

1141
00:41:27,059 --> 00:41:33,900
bring in a red teamer a CT eye analyst a

1142
00:41:29,970 --> 00:41:35,519
defender create a hunting party go find

1143
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:37,079
whatever adversary is a priority for you

1144
00:41:35,519 --> 00:41:39,750
go try to hunt and see if they're on

1145
00:41:37,079 --> 00:41:41,549
there and on your network this is a

1146
00:41:39,750 --> 00:41:43,650
great way that red teams can help drive

1147
00:41:41,549 --> 00:41:46,049
that mindset of kind of the adversary

1148
00:41:43,650 --> 00:41:47,759
focus that attack brings as well an

1149
00:41:46,049 --> 00:41:49,589
attack can be a great way to plan out

1150
00:41:47,759 --> 00:41:51,509
those hunting parties figure out what

1151
00:41:49,589 --> 00:41:56,339
are you looking for that an adversary

1152
00:41:51,509 --> 00:41:58,680
might have done on your network so you

1153
00:41:56,339 --> 00:42:00,029
sat there about 40 minutes of us talking

1154
00:41:58,680 --> 00:42:01,319
about Frawley

1155
00:42:00,030 --> 00:42:02,760
hopefully you put yourself in the hot

1156
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:06,060
seat of one of our characters here

1157
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:08,010
grease a Lurie or Alice Mallory or or

1158
00:42:06,060 --> 00:42:09,509
Kevin so let's let's talk about how you

1159
00:42:08,010 --> 00:42:13,260
can actually play this at home we'll

1160
00:42:09,510 --> 00:42:15,420
start the wrap up here it's a great cxo

1161
00:42:13,260 --> 00:42:17,670
team lead maybe it's just you maybe

1162
00:42:15,420 --> 00:42:19,950
you're an army of one maybe you are CTO

1163
00:42:17,670 --> 00:42:21,480
maybe you just have to talk to the CTO

1164
00:42:19,950 --> 00:42:23,879
and give them that sense of security

1165
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:25,110
her original issue was she had a false

1166
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:26,580
sense of security she didn't actually

1167
00:42:25,110 --> 00:42:29,610
know what was happening in the audience

1168
00:42:26,580 --> 00:42:31,650
or in the in her network and that really

1169
00:42:29,610 --> 00:42:33,540
cost her some concern which led her to

1170
00:42:31,650 --> 00:42:36,060
have very sometimes abusive emails

1171
00:42:33,540 --> 00:42:37,860
sometimes some short communications and

1172
00:42:36,060 --> 00:42:39,600
then not an understanding of what her

1173
00:42:37,860 --> 00:42:41,220
team was talking to her about right she

1174
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:44,220
didn't share that taxonomy that shared

1175
00:42:41,220 --> 00:42:46,379
language she wasn't quite sure now we've

1176
00:42:44,220 --> 00:42:48,330
implemented a shared taxonomy we have

1177
00:42:46,380 --> 00:42:51,090
new visualizations that don't do red and

1178
00:42:48,330 --> 00:42:53,549
green but rather a intelligent sliding

1179
00:42:51,090 --> 00:42:54,990
idea of what comfort level and now she

1180
00:42:53,550 --> 00:42:57,000
can actually communicate back to her

1181
00:42:54,990 --> 00:42:58,560
team and they can communicate her about

1182
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:01,860
the actual up-to-date level of their

1183
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:03,630
defenses on the threat Intel side you

1184
00:43:01,860 --> 00:43:05,550
know Mallory was struggling if it's not

1185
00:43:03,630 --> 00:43:08,100
an IP if it's not that atomic indicator

1186
00:43:05,550 --> 00:43:09,990
how do I use that and I'm not gonna lie

1187
00:43:08,100 --> 00:43:11,279
I've been there I talked to a lot of

1188
00:43:09,990 --> 00:43:13,680
analysts who have been in that same a

1189
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:15,510
struggle bus a little bit so she

1190
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:17,370
realized well we need to move to

1191
00:43:15,510 --> 00:43:20,010
detecting those behaviors those

1192
00:43:17,370 --> 00:43:22,259
techniques moving up that pyramid of

1193
00:43:20,010 --> 00:43:24,540
pain to those behaviors of those TTP's

1194
00:43:22,260 --> 00:43:26,220
that are more painful for an adversary

1195
00:43:24,540 --> 00:43:28,680
to change with a shout-out to our good

1196
00:43:26,220 --> 00:43:30,209
friend David Bianco on that she also

1197
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:32,190
realized that you know threats are

1198
00:43:30,210 --> 00:43:33,360
always going to be changing so she's

1199
00:43:32,190 --> 00:43:35,550
gonna have to incorporate new

1200
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:37,230
information about new adversary

1201
00:43:35,550 --> 00:43:39,360
behaviors when those threats come up

1202
00:43:37,230 --> 00:43:41,940
when threat models that constantly

1203
00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:44,970
change as they do when new adversaries

1204
00:43:41,940 --> 00:43:46,830
come up for Alice a blue tumor she's

1205
00:43:44,970 --> 00:43:48,480
really good at her job but she was

1206
00:43:46,830 --> 00:43:50,250
taking the attack framework and just

1207
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:51,600
going down the list and treating it like

1208
00:43:50,250 --> 00:43:53,970
something she just had to complete on a

1209
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:55,740
worksheet by changing your mindset and

1210
00:43:53,970 --> 00:43:57,720
looking at those techniques rather than

1211
00:43:55,740 --> 00:44:00,149
just those very atomic indicators of

1212
00:43:57,720 --> 00:44:01,799
hashes IPS and file names she's gonna

1213
00:44:00,150 --> 00:44:03,390
have a much better success of actually

1214
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:05,940
finding air adversaries who are

1215
00:44:03,390 --> 00:44:07,859
polymorphic and also reducing her

1216
00:44:05,940 --> 00:44:10,110
overall alerts right so now she can

1217
00:44:07,860 --> 00:44:11,670
prioritize and she's gonna have a better

1218
00:44:10,110 --> 00:44:13,410
understanding of the data she has and

1219
00:44:11,670 --> 00:44:14,700
also the gap says she has an analytic

1220
00:44:13,410 --> 00:44:16,529
which hopefully will let her communicate

1221
00:44:14,700 --> 00:44:20,220
to Greece better to get more funding to

1222
00:44:16,530 --> 00:44:22,800
buy more licenses and on the red team's

1223
00:44:20,220 --> 00:44:25,620
side Kevin our red teamer he wanted to

1224
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:28,200
help but he wasn't sure how now he

1225
00:44:25,620 --> 00:44:31,080
realizes as many red teams to using a

1226
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:33,569
tack and help drive the defenders to

1227
00:44:31,080 --> 00:44:35,730
improve use those red team operations

1228
00:44:33,570 --> 00:44:37,770
their knowledge of those gaps to help

1229
00:44:35,730 --> 00:44:39,720
defenders know the gaps to fill and

1230
00:44:37,770 --> 00:44:43,890
really move towards that threat inform

1231
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:45,180
defense so takeaways here if there's one

1232
00:44:43,890 --> 00:44:47,100
thing I really want to get across for

1233
00:44:45,180 --> 00:44:49,620
everyone in this room his attack is not

1234
00:44:47,100 --> 00:44:51,089
just for giant Deloitte's or where giant

1235
00:44:49,620 --> 00:44:52,500
companies with a hundred five hundred

1236
00:44:51,090 --> 00:44:54,240
thousand employees right they can be

1237
00:44:52,500 --> 00:44:55,680
just you you might wear a lot of

1238
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:57,689
different hats you might be the threat

1239
00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:59,640
Intel person if you don't have a threat

1240
00:44:57,690 --> 00:45:01,200
Intel team mitre attack provides a lot

1241
00:44:59,640 --> 00:45:03,060
of basic analysis that you can actually

1242
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:04,620
go through written by people in this

1243
00:45:03,060 --> 00:45:07,080
room right that you may not be able to

1244
00:45:04,620 --> 00:45:08,819
afford on a normal day you're gonna be

1245
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:10,350
able to find data of where these TTP's

1246
00:45:08,820 --> 00:45:12,930
come from that you've never seen before

1247
00:45:10,350 --> 00:45:14,640
if you're a big or finally you have that

1248
00:45:12,930 --> 00:45:16,169
language where you can get those fifteen

1249
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:17,879
different teams that all hate each other

1250
00:45:16,170 --> 00:45:20,040
and are fighting for funding to actually

1251
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:22,800
communicate and talk and try to get

1252
00:45:20,040 --> 00:45:25,860
through and improve that process the

1253
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:27,900
next one starts small I go back to the

1254
00:45:25,860 --> 00:45:30,570
phrase don't let the perfect be the

1255
00:45:27,900 --> 00:45:33,000
enemy of the good enough maybe you just

1256
00:45:30,570 --> 00:45:36,030
start with a single technique a single

1257
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:38,640
detection a single group but start

1258
00:45:36,030 --> 00:45:40,470
somewhere start to improve your defenses

1259
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:42,270
and you're just gonna have to iterate

1260
00:45:40,470 --> 00:45:44,339
none of us are perfect we're never a

1261
00:45:42,270 --> 00:45:47,100
hundred percent green but start

1262
00:45:44,340 --> 00:45:50,010
somewhere start small be realistic and

1263
00:45:47,100 --> 00:45:51,240
iterate and improve your detection and

1264
00:45:50,010 --> 00:45:53,280
the final thing if you really want to

1265
00:45:51,240 --> 00:45:55,950
like we said a super speed your attack

1266
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:57,720
integration come up with a tool that can

1267
00:45:55,950 --> 00:45:59,490
be collaborative and that you can

1268
00:45:57,720 --> 00:46:01,620
cooperate across right so you can

1269
00:45:59,490 --> 00:46:03,660
communicate do real-time updates I'm a

1270
00:46:01,620 --> 00:46:04,140
huge fan of how mitre has the backend

1271
00:46:03,660 --> 00:46:06,299
for

1272
00:46:04,140 --> 00:46:07,980
mitre is actually dates on API friendly

1273
00:46:06,300 --> 00:46:09,990
so you can actually dynamically update

1274
00:46:07,980 --> 00:46:12,240
all these TTP s as they make the changes

1275
00:46:09,990 --> 00:46:13,740
and update things this is huge build

1276
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:15,720
that framework get those people

1277
00:46:13,740 --> 00:46:20,160
communicating even if you just start

1278
00:46:15,720 --> 00:46:22,830
with Excel you're doing alright since

1279
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:25,350
I'm a quick thank yous I am also a very

1280
00:46:22,830 --> 00:46:27,240
passionate advocate for underrepresented

1281
00:46:25,350 --> 00:46:28,799
people in cyber

1282
00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:30,540
is something I believe in quite heavily

1283
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:32,610
and try to do quite a bit of in my

1284
00:46:30,540 --> 00:46:34,140
personal life Katie and I were overjoyed

1285
00:46:32,610 --> 00:46:35,610
when we found out blackhat actually

1286
00:46:34,140 --> 00:46:38,310
sponsored allowed us to bring two

1287
00:46:35,610 --> 00:46:40,440
students to black cap for free passes so

1288
00:46:38,310 --> 00:46:42,869
thank you black hat that is awesome

1289
00:46:40,440 --> 00:46:44,190
also thank you to Splunk because they

1290
00:46:42,869 --> 00:46:46,290
actually paid for travelling expenses

1291
00:46:44,190 --> 00:46:48,660
for these two people specifically Haiyan

1292
00:46:46,290 --> 00:46:51,330
in Cairo which is awesome really helping

1293
00:46:48,660 --> 00:46:56,069
out the community and also to our two

1294
00:46:51,330 --> 00:46:57,720
wonderful people came Adriana and DV as

1295
00:46:56,070 --> 00:46:59,850
we all know we don't none of us do this

1296
00:46:57,720 --> 00:47:02,100
alone I'm here but there's a huge attack

1297
00:46:59,850 --> 00:47:03,779
team behind me special shout out to

1298
00:47:02,100 --> 00:47:05,400
Blake Strom when the original creators

1299
00:47:03,780 --> 00:47:08,220
of attack he brought me on this team

1300
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:09,840
that an awesome mentor and leader Adam

1301
00:47:08,220 --> 00:47:12,000
Pennington from the attack team helped

1302
00:47:09,840 --> 00:47:14,310
out a ton with slides helped me figure

1303
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:15,660
out what I was gonna say there's a whole
