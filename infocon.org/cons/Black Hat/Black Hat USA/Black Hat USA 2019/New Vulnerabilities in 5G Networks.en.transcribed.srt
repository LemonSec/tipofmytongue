1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,080
good afternoon welcome to new

2
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:05,910
vulnerabilities in 5g networks here in

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:08,340
South Pacific with your speaker I'll top

4
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:10,469
shade before we begin a few brief notes

5
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:12,450
please stop by the business Hall located

6
00:00:10,469 --> 00:00:14,518
in Mandalay Bay Oceanside and shoreline

7
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:16,619
ballrooms on level 2 during the day and

8
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:18,990
for the welcome reception tonight at

9
00:00:16,619 --> 00:00:21,390
5:30 the black cap Arsenal is in the

10
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:23,788
business hall on level 2 please join us

11
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:26,039
for the pony Awards in lagoon JKL at

12
00:00:23,789 --> 00:00:27,930
6:30 p.m. and don't forget the

13
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:29,250
merchandise store on level 2 and session

14
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:30,840
recordings from source source of

15
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:33,059
knowledge they have a desk on every

16
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:34,530
level of the conference please put all

17
00:00:33,059 --> 00:00:36,239
of your phones on vibrate which makes it

18
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:37,440
easier for us to ignore the ringing

19
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:38,968
while you wait for your voicemail to

20
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:49,949
pick it up now please give a warm

21
00:00:38,969 --> 00:00:52,079
welcome to autopsy welcome back

22
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:56,820
everybody I hope everybody has a had a

23
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:59,280
great lunch maybe heavy lunch okay so

24
00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:00,750
I'm Altaf sake and I'm actually a PhD

25
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:04,140
student at the Technical University of

26
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:06,510
Berlin and my co-speaker Ravi Shankar a

27
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:09,240
research scientist at the Cintas in

28
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:10,799
Norway unfortunately he was not able to

29
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:14,039
attend blackhead like some family

30
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:16,920
emergency so I'll be doing the time so

31
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:18,990
as the typing phase we found some new

32
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:23,159
vulnerabilities in 5g network so we'll

33
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:26,070
be talking about that we all know like

34
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:28,680
the kind of pipe 5g has today I think

35
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:30,929
even bigger than this room so everybody

36
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:32,400
is talking about 5g what is it and even

37
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:34,530
my friends like who doesn't know

38
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:36,329
anything about technology who is working

39
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:38,579
in banking sector i keeps asking me like

40
00:01:36,329 --> 00:01:40,500
what is 5g then what's happening in the

41
00:01:38,579 --> 00:01:42,298
news like I think you all know what's

42
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:44,610
happening in the news regarding 5g and

43
00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:47,220
it's deployment so so it's kind of crazy

44
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:51,149
where we found some new issues and then

45
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:54,810
I'll be talking about that so beginning

46
00:01:51,149 --> 00:01:56,250
I just give a short overview of how 5g

47
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:58,950
security looks like and the kind of

48
00:01:56,250 --> 00:02:02,939
threat landscape we have following that

49
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:05,250
I talk about the kind of RMC catch is

50
00:02:02,939 --> 00:02:08,038
really possible in 5g and what can we

51
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:09,929
expect in the future and I finished with

52
00:02:08,038 --> 00:02:12,299
the kind of new vulnerabilities we found

53
00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:13,360
in 5g and how we got them fixed and all

54
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:17,569
this

55
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:19,370
so basically pipe Jesus is for machine

56
00:02:17,569 --> 00:02:21,859
communication I mean not only machine

57
00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:24,079
communication but because like we had to

58
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:26,629
G 3G and 4G everything which was used

59
00:02:24,079 --> 00:02:28,819
for human communication but 5g I think

60
00:02:26,629 --> 00:02:30,980
it takes another level where it's

61
00:02:28,819 --> 00:02:32,390
actually being designed for machines to

62
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:35,869
communicate for example we take

63
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:38,089
autonomous vehicles or even low latency

64
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:40,250
communication devices like for example I

65
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:44,989
would be so all this stuff it's it's

66
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:47,269
made for machines so if we go a bit okay

67
00:02:44,989 --> 00:02:49,459
there is a lot of stuff about like 5g is

68
00:02:47,269 --> 00:02:50,870
so much bandwidth it's high speed all

69
00:02:49,459 --> 00:02:54,829
these things but putting them aside

70
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:56,750
talking about security 5g had like some

71
00:02:54,829 --> 00:02:59,510
strong security requirements obviously

72
00:02:56,750 --> 00:03:01,790
it should be better than 4G so same way

73
00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:03,260
there are three elements in which I

74
00:03:01,790 --> 00:03:05,629
would like to present like in five

75
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:07,849
disagree or if the first one is we have

76
00:03:05,629 --> 00:03:11,179
new use cases like so many use cases

77
00:03:07,849 --> 00:03:13,819
that are actually depending on 5g like

78
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:15,849
autonomous vehicles I would be many many

79
00:03:13,819 --> 00:03:18,500
different industries many use cases

80
00:03:15,849 --> 00:03:20,328
ultra reliable low latency communication

81
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:23,750
mission-critical communication so

82
00:03:20,329 --> 00:03:26,989
there's a lot which depends on 5g to

83
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:30,590
actually facilitate the the fact or to

84
00:03:26,989 --> 00:03:32,209
have all these use cases successful we

85
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:34,220
need different kind of technologies on

86
00:03:32,209 --> 00:03:35,419
the core network for example like we

87
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:37,790
have different technologies like

88
00:03:35,419 --> 00:03:39,500
software-defined networking then NFV in

89
00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:42,379
the network like the virtualization

90
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:44,030
technologies then network slicing

91
00:03:42,379 --> 00:03:45,590
features so these are some new features

92
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:48,019
which are coming into the core networks

93
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:50,239
which never existed in mobile mobile

94
00:03:48,019 --> 00:03:52,729
area or like mobile network area and

95
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:56,810
they are somehow coming into reality

96
00:03:52,729 --> 00:03:58,940
with 5g plus we have the LT security

97
00:03:56,810 --> 00:03:59,840
requirements comparatively compared to

98
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:02,448
2g or 3G

99
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:05,239
LT was much more secure although we saw

100
00:04:02,449 --> 00:04:06,620
so many attacks on LT but encryption and

101
00:04:05,239 --> 00:04:08,840
integrity protection wise like

102
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:11,620
authentication wise it was much much

103
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:15,319
stronger than what we saw in 2g and 3G

104
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:17,930
so all these requirements build up the

105
00:04:15,319 --> 00:04:20,238
whole 5g requirement set and we have to

106
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:23,360
see in the in the upcoming years like is

107
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:25,849
5g would would 5g be successful in

108
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:26,600
actually making this requirements a

109
00:04:25,849 --> 00:04:29,599
reality

110
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:31,760
or can the attacks in the past like

111
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:34,880
repeat like for example in C catcher

112
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:37,270
attacks or location-tracking attacks I

113
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:38,420
think we have to wait and see for this

114
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:40,880
okay

115
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:44,120
so there are different elements in 5g

116
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:45,980
security so I just brought it like three

117
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:47,960
different ones the first one is the cell

118
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:51,020
level where we have so many different

119
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:52,849
devices not only phones we have cars

120
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:56,060
then we have smart homes then we have

121
00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:57,680
different I go to devices then we have

122
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:59,270
different type of base stations like

123
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:01,280
previously it used to be a bit

124
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:04,130
centralized now we have a mix of

125
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:06,049
centralized way stations and then

126
00:05:04,130 --> 00:05:08,810
distributed base stations so there is a

127
00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:10,460
whole lot of like different devices will

128
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:13,550
be scattered like millions of devices

129
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:18,349
will be scattered around us and this

130
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:20,870
will be managed by a kind of sorry kind

131
00:05:18,350 --> 00:05:23,480
of having the edge cloud which actually

132
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:25,700
facilitates the speed of having

133
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:27,110
different applications like you'll see

134
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:30,050
in the future like how it's possible

135
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:32,000
with with different applications then we

136
00:05:30,050 --> 00:05:35,200
have the central cloud which we call

137
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:37,700
code Network but this will be completely

138
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:39,710
changed into something like cloud base

139
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:43,670
where you have all this virtualization

140
00:05:39,710 --> 00:05:45,260
technologies network slicing or for

141
00:05:43,670 --> 00:05:47,570
example let's take a simple case where

142
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:49,370
and I would be provided like service

143
00:05:47,570 --> 00:05:51,920
provider would like to would receive an

144
00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:54,560
access or actually install his own

145
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:57,140
applications directly on the network

146
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:58,850
operators hardware so basically this is

147
00:05:57,140 --> 00:06:00,740
something we call like network slicing

148
00:05:58,850 --> 00:06:04,490
each kind of application is receiving a

149
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:07,370
slice and the security of the slice or

150
00:06:04,490 --> 00:06:10,100
the operations the kind of speed all

151
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:11,960
this could be configured in real time

152
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:14,290
and this is something the operators and

153
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:16,729
then the service provider like have to

154
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:19,970
discuss so this is something we call its

155
00:06:16,730 --> 00:06:22,150
laconic like network as a service so

156
00:06:19,970 --> 00:06:25,910
today I will be talking more on the

157
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:28,219
radio part the the over-the-air network

158
00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:30,230
level part so if you look in 5g there is

159
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:32,720
lot of changes like there is improvement

160
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:33,860
in integrity protection there is

161
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:36,680
improvement in privacy

162
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:40,040
like for example hiding the permanent

163
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:43,620
subscriber identity which is MC

164
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:45,990
then we have improved improvement in

165
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:48,750
resilience like for example if what

166
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:50,520
happens like when when certain messages

167
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:52,410
like which are not protected are kind of

168
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:54,719
misused like how do you deal with such

169
00:06:52,410 --> 00:06:57,600
kind of scenarios are somehow address in

170
00:06:54,720 --> 00:07:00,210
5g so there was a lot of improvements

171
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:02,190
and we will look into that mainly in

172
00:07:00,210 --> 00:07:06,539
this I would be talking in this region

173
00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:10,890
so if we go back just see how security

174
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:13,020
has evolved from Fuji to 5g so first one

175
00:07:10,890 --> 00:07:14,550
to G the straight statement like there

176
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:16,560
is no mutual authentication so false

177
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:20,520
basestation attacks are are simply

178
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:22,080
straight forward and even today like

179
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:23,760
there are so many commercial in C

180
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:26,820
catcher like stingray type of devices

181
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:29,130
that still use 2g to intercept voice

182
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:30,570
traffic and then we have 3G which

183
00:07:29,130 --> 00:07:32,400
improved there was a mutual

184
00:07:30,570 --> 00:07:34,159
authentication where the phone and the

185
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:37,109
base station authenticate each other

186
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:38,520
this somehow can eliminate ok this

187
00:07:37,110 --> 00:07:40,890
doesn't really eliminate the problem of

188
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:44,370
fake base station still you can operate

189
00:07:40,890 --> 00:07:47,130
fake base stations then we have the 4g

190
00:07:44,370 --> 00:07:49,760
we have mutual authentication the same

191
00:07:47,130 --> 00:07:52,080
which was taken from GG then we have

192
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:53,789
integrity protection for the control

193
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:56,969
plane messages exchanged between phone

194
00:07:53,790 --> 00:07:59,250
and base station also similar thing

195
00:07:56,970 --> 00:08:00,720
applied in 5g but little bit improved in

196
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:03,180
the terms of mutual authentication like

197
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:06,690
trying to prevent fraud attacks like

198
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:09,030
location fraud attacks the same kind of

199
00:08:06,690 --> 00:08:11,580
algorithms which were used in for

200
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:14,849
cheaper reused in 5g they're also still

201
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:16,440
working on 256 bit encryption algorithms

202
00:08:14,850 --> 00:08:20,130
but this is something I think we have to

203
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:22,800
wait for the future so so security has

204
00:08:20,130 --> 00:08:25,260
changed a lot when we are moving from to

205
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:27,360
G to 5g so obviously we expect that PI G

206
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:31,620
should be really stronger than than 2 G

207
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:33,510
so the when you talk about like attacks

208
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:36,120
in cellular networks the the common

209
00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:38,340
device or the common thing you you call

210
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:40,470
is like MC catcher so this is something

211
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:43,350
in the beginning it used to be like a

212
00:08:40,470 --> 00:08:45,350
device which is harvested for collecting

213
00:08:43,350 --> 00:08:49,320
identities or SIM card identities or

214
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:50,310
even IMEI s-- or not not only in C's but

215
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:52,260
also IME eyes

216
00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:53,180
so this revealed information about the

217
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:56,420
subscriber and the

218
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:59,060
and later like they also use the term MC

219
00:08:56,420 --> 00:09:01,790
catcher for whites interception attacks

220
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:03,469
or even location tracking or different

221
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:06,560
kind of attacks but this one was mostly

222
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:07,910
on the 8 interface attacks we have

223
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:09,829
something else on the on the core

224
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:11,899
network side like a c7 attacks or even

225
00:09:09,830 --> 00:09:17,480
diameter based ISEC attacks but that's a

226
00:09:11,899 --> 00:09:20,149
different story so if we look in on 2g

227
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:22,339
like the in C and IMEI was available in

228
00:09:20,149 --> 00:09:23,660
clear text for for any kind of attacker

229
00:09:22,339 --> 00:09:25,279
like for example even the passive

230
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:28,640
attacker can actually obtain in C and

231
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:30,950
IMEI then we moved to through 3G the

232
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:32,689
same like MC ni ma I was not given any

233
00:09:30,950 --> 00:09:37,190
protection maybe it was not a priority

234
00:09:32,690 --> 00:09:38,720
then then moving to 4G there was a kind

235
00:09:37,190 --> 00:09:41,870
of protection which was available for

236
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:44,990
IMEI so any rogue attack that cannot

237
00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:47,120
actually access the IMEI of any phone or

238
00:09:44,990 --> 00:09:50,690
any kind of device this was protected in

239
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:54,320
fortune moving to 5g both of them are

240
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:56,959
hidden now so they kind of encrypt MC

241
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:59,450
and trying to call it like soupy it's

242
00:09:56,959 --> 00:10:01,699
like a concealed identifier so the

243
00:09:59,450 --> 00:10:04,690
problem of MC catching like just the

244
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:06,980
word MC catching is solved in 5g but

245
00:10:04,690 --> 00:10:08,660
encrypting the in C is something that's

246
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:10,430
optional and it's up to the network

247
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:12,800
operators like to implement because this

248
00:10:10,430 --> 00:10:14,689
takes a lot of effort because you need

249
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:17,829
to have a kind of public key in the same

250
00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:20,540
card to actually encrypt the in C so

251
00:10:17,830 --> 00:10:22,730
this will take time to actually see it

252
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:24,199
in practice so I'm actually still

253
00:10:22,730 --> 00:10:26,120
waiting for that like to see somebody

254
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:31,430
implement that and then we can somehow

255
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:33,560
give a test so talking about like 5g

256
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:37,069
security yes it is definitely better

257
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:39,170
than 4G and there were a lot of attacks

258
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:40,550
which a lot of vulnerabilities which

259
00:10:39,170 --> 00:10:42,829
were fixed for example like the

260
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:44,180
downgrade attacks or did some other

261
00:10:42,829 --> 00:10:46,489
denial of service attacks which were

262
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:51,620
fixed in 5g then location tracking

263
00:10:46,490 --> 00:10:54,260
problems were fixed in 5g but the 5g was

264
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:55,730
using the same algorithms but I would

265
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:57,380
say like maybe a little bit enhanced

266
00:10:55,730 --> 00:10:58,910
like there could be new algorithms but

267
00:10:57,380 --> 00:11:01,100
but at the moment like there are the

268
00:10:58,910 --> 00:11:03,260
same algorithms from 4G they are reused

269
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:04,900
and there could be a stronger ones which

270
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:07,270
which might come up

271
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:11,800
but it's something that's not fixed in

272
00:11:07,270 --> 00:11:14,260
4G so obviously it's taken to 5g so why

273
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:16,050
I said why I say this is because there

274
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:18,730
are the similar kind of protocols which

275
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:21,969
started from 2g then they were taken to

276
00:11:18,730 --> 00:11:23,770
3G and 4G so the kind of way or the

277
00:11:21,970 --> 00:11:27,610
protocol stack that behaves in mobile

278
00:11:23,770 --> 00:11:28,840
networks like never actually changed but

279
00:11:27,610 --> 00:11:30,400
they have a lot of improvements in terms

280
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:33,370
of like authentication encryption and

281
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:35,530
integrity protection but if you don't

282
00:11:33,370 --> 00:11:36,850
fix the the main problem like you still

283
00:11:35,530 --> 00:11:41,050
see the attacks happening again and

284
00:11:36,850 --> 00:11:43,270
again so one kind of MC catcher attack

285
00:11:41,050 --> 00:11:45,790
in 5g be presented I think we actually

286
00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:47,920
presented this in last year blackhat so

287
00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:49,750
this was tracking the location of or

288
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:52,660
attracting the presence of a particular

289
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:55,150
SIM card in a particular location so

290
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:56,770
this was still possible on 5g and there

291
00:11:55,150 --> 00:11:58,449
is still some discussion going on in the

292
00:11:56,770 --> 00:12:02,680
standards like trying to address this

293
00:11:58,450 --> 00:12:05,830
problem so I'm going to talk about

294
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:08,109
something new which we figured out so

295
00:12:05,830 --> 00:12:11,470
this is called capabilities so when I'm

296
00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:13,150
telling like capabilities of a modem I'm

297
00:12:11,470 --> 00:12:16,870
not talking about the processor we have

298
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:19,180
in the phone or the the speed of the RAM

299
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:21,850
or nothing like this I'm exactly talking

300
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:24,880
about the capabilities of a modem like

301
00:12:21,850 --> 00:12:26,760
what a modem is actually able to do so

302
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:29,980
we have like two different capabilities

303
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:31,810
of the modem like these are actually

304
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:33,340
defined in the standards these

305
00:12:31,810 --> 00:12:36,459
capabilities are defined in the

306
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:38,800
standards and like I also mention the

307
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:40,600
standards in the bottom but but okay

308
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,620
there are two different capabilities the

309
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:44,200
first one is the coordinate for

310
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:46,030
capabilities then the second one is the

311
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:49,480
radio access capabilities so the first

312
00:12:46,030 --> 00:12:51,550
one is a core network so these are these

313
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:54,400
capabilities include like the security

314
00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:56,410
algorithms that are supported by the

315
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:59,050
modem then does the modern support voice

316
00:12:56,410 --> 00:13:01,270
voice calling features or does the modem

317
00:12:59,050 --> 00:13:02,319
support SMS features and does the modem

318
00:13:01,270 --> 00:13:04,480
support like v2x

319
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:07,360
which is coming maybe in a couple of

320
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:09,520
years the the automotive automated

321
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:12,460
automotive vehicle features so we are

322
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:15,340
going to say this in in 5g or maybe one

323
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:17,770
or two years from now then talking about

324
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:18,760
the radio access capabilities it the

325
00:13:17,770 --> 00:13:20,860
word itself this

326
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:22,750
describes it like for example what kind

327
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:26,050
of frequency bands it supports then the

328
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:28,300
RX and TX features then does it supports

329
00:13:26,050 --> 00:13:30,069
like multi-input multi-output features

330
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:32,560
so these are some of the features that

331
00:13:30,070 --> 00:13:35,320
are really responsible for the high

332
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:37,899
speeds we see in 4G and also something

333
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:40,149
called category so if you take the word

334
00:13:37,899 --> 00:13:44,470
category there are like 20 different

335
00:13:40,149 --> 00:13:45,880
categories in in LTE and each if you if

336
00:13:44,470 --> 00:13:47,740
you increase the number of the category

337
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:50,139
for example if you take I phone 10 which

338
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:53,529
is a cat 16 device or if you take

339
00:13:50,139 --> 00:13:57,040
Samsung Galaxy s4 it's a cat 4 device

340
00:13:53,529 --> 00:14:00,850
so as the the bottle up the model

341
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:03,610
increases in its capacity or price the

342
00:14:00,850 --> 00:14:05,170
the category also increases so these are

343
00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:08,829
the to refer to different capabilities

344
00:14:05,170 --> 00:14:10,959
that exist in the model as a normal user

345
00:14:08,829 --> 00:14:12,699
as a smartphone user or we don't get to

346
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:17,138
see them because they are inside the

347
00:14:12,699 --> 00:14:19,089
modem inside the basement processor so a

348
00:14:17,139 --> 00:14:20,980
little bit more detail maybe if you if

349
00:14:19,089 --> 00:14:22,720
you wanted you could actually access it

350
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:23,709
when you're reading slide so so there

351
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:28,709
are different coordinate four

352
00:14:23,709 --> 00:14:31,719
capabilities for example like the the

353
00:14:28,709 --> 00:14:34,239
like device calling capabilities the SMS

354
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:36,790
supports or what kind of voice codecs it

355
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:39,459
supports like AMR half-rate mr or

356
00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:42,880
full-rate mr or for example i when you

357
00:14:39,459 --> 00:14:44,349
take a USB stick USB dongle it doesn't

358
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:45,970
support voice calling features like it

359
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:53,380
only supports the data data features

360
00:14:45,970 --> 00:14:55,300
maybe SMS so so some of some of the new

361
00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:57,610
capabilities like which are coming in 5g

362
00:14:55,300 --> 00:15:00,790
for example we call it like ciot

363
00:14:57,610 --> 00:15:02,620
cellular i wanti this is not really 5g

364
00:15:00,790 --> 00:15:04,810
but this is like the I think the final

365
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:08,440
varies of LT like release 13 and release

366
00:15:04,810 --> 00:15:10,779
14 then we have v2x features which will

367
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:12,639
show up in couple of years so these are

368
00:15:10,779 --> 00:15:14,350
really like 5g specific so these

369
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:16,149
capabilities are existing in the model

370
00:15:14,350 --> 00:15:18,399
and then we have the radio access

371
00:15:16,149 --> 00:15:22,209
capabilities like I said there is a

372
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:24,670
category for example this get this modem

373
00:15:22,209 --> 00:15:26,469
capabilities our category 4 and there

374
00:15:24,670 --> 00:15:28,689
are different capabilities like physical

375
00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:31,180
layer parameters RF parameters so there

376
00:15:28,689 --> 00:15:31,819
are like thousands of parameters or like

377
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:34,130
feet

378
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:37,250
optional features in defined for the

379
00:15:34,130 --> 00:15:39,290
modem so basically these are designed by

380
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:42,380
the baseband manufactures for example a

381
00:15:39,290 --> 00:15:44,630
Qualcomm or whoever Intel or so they

382
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:47,360
actually read the standards and then

383
00:15:44,630 --> 00:15:53,120
define it inside their modem like they

384
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:55,460
program okay

385
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:58,130
so basically these capabilities are

386
00:15:55,460 --> 00:16:00,260
actually sent to the network whenever

387
00:15:58,130 --> 00:16:02,840
your device is registering to the

388
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:04,340
network so let's start with the basic

389
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:06,170
registration procedure you turn it on

390
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:07,700
and then the first one is like the

391
00:16:06,170 --> 00:16:11,329
coordinate for capabilities are sent to

392
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:13,130
the network then the the core network is

393
00:16:11,330 --> 00:16:16,310
doing authentication and security very

394
00:16:13,130 --> 00:16:19,010
good then the core network is actually

395
00:16:16,310 --> 00:16:21,079
asking the device like send me the radio

396
00:16:19,010 --> 00:16:23,090
capabilities okay it sends the radio

397
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:26,210
capabilities then it performs the

398
00:16:23,090 --> 00:16:28,160
over-the-air security like encrypting

399
00:16:26,210 --> 00:16:29,570
and integrity protecting the the

400
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:31,370
communication which is happening between

401
00:16:29,570 --> 00:16:33,350
the phone and the base station so the

402
00:16:31,370 --> 00:16:36,140
encryption actually starts after sending

403
00:16:33,350 --> 00:16:38,000
the capabilities and then finally if

404
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:39,260
everything goes well then registration

405
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:42,260
success and then then you have data

406
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:43,819
access and everything so what we see

407
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:46,280
here is like these capabilities are

408
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:48,440
actually sent before setting up the

409
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:50,089
security so which means that an active

410
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:51,920
attacker can actually obtain these

411
00:16:50,090 --> 00:16:53,510
capabilities or a passive attacker

412
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:55,310
listening between the phone and the base

413
00:16:53,510 --> 00:16:58,670
station can also receive access to this

414
00:16:55,310 --> 00:17:01,369
capabilities so both passive and active

415
00:16:58,670 --> 00:17:02,719
attacks are possible in this case so we

416
00:17:01,370 --> 00:17:04,849
try to do some passive and active

417
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:08,060
attacks in this one so what's the issue

418
00:17:04,849 --> 00:17:10,760
was like an issue was these capabilities

419
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:14,020
are accessible by fake base stations you

420
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:16,280
can easily set it up on 4G or 5g and

421
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:18,079
then the second thing is like they are

422
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:19,879
sent in plaintext to the network and

423
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:21,349
then we found some standard and

424
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:24,230
implementation problems like that

425
00:17:21,349 --> 00:17:26,569
allowed us to exploit these capabilities

426
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:28,130
and then do some other at the attacks so

427
00:17:26,569 --> 00:17:30,950
we did like three types of attacks the

428
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:33,410
first one was mobile network mapping we

429
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:35,300
call it like MN map so this n map is

430
00:17:33,410 --> 00:17:38,150
this MN map is something similar to the

431
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:39,830
N map that you see in traditional IP I'm

432
00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:41,810
gonna explain it like in the coming

433
00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:44,159
slides so then the second type of attack

434
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:47,580
we are doing is the bidding down attacks

435
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:50,429
bringing the user down from 40 to 2g or

436
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:52,100
even from 5 D to G then we have battery

437
00:17:50,429 --> 00:17:55,620
drain attacks which is very very

438
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:57,809
dedicated to to narrowband IOT networks

439
00:17:55,620 --> 00:18:00,239
I'm sure like you must have heard of

440
00:17:57,809 --> 00:18:02,970
this narrow band IOT term quite often

441
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:07,350
these days so to do some attack like we

442
00:18:02,970 --> 00:18:10,620
try to set up the hole maybe we cater

443
00:18:07,350 --> 00:18:12,809
like a despot so we so like I said we

444
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:14,489
did a man-in-the-middle attack because

445
00:18:12,809 --> 00:18:16,770
we are trying to modify the capability

446
00:18:14,490 --> 00:18:19,049
so I will explain you that so we use two

447
00:18:16,770 --> 00:18:21,299
different us our piece with this then we

448
00:18:19,049 --> 00:18:23,668
use some open source software that was

449
00:18:21,299 --> 00:18:26,809
available from SRS LT guys like thanks

450
00:18:23,669 --> 00:18:30,240
for the great work so we set up a whole

451
00:18:26,809 --> 00:18:32,790
man-in-the-middle relay so basically we

452
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:34,919
have the the phone side then we have the

453
00:18:32,790 --> 00:18:37,139
base station side which is relaying all

454
00:18:34,919 --> 00:18:41,730
the traffic from a legitimate phone to

455
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:43,919
the legitimate network then we tested

456
00:18:41,730 --> 00:18:46,980
this on some of the commercial networks

457
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:50,850
actually across Europe and US and some

458
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:53,130
other countries for testing we use so

459
00:18:50,850 --> 00:18:55,740
many devices I think roughly around 80

460
00:18:53,130 --> 00:18:58,020
to 90 devices like different types of

461
00:18:55,740 --> 00:19:00,090
phone different types of modems allowed

462
00:18:58,020 --> 00:19:04,889
laptops because they also have modems

463
00:19:00,090 --> 00:19:06,659
inside so the first attack like we are

464
00:19:04,890 --> 00:19:09,270
trying to do nmap what does an nmap do

465
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:10,620
it gives you information about the live

466
00:19:09,270 --> 00:19:12,360
host which are connected to your network

467
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:13,770
the kind of information is like what

468
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:16,320
kind of ports what kind of operating

469
00:19:13,770 --> 00:19:18,299
system it's running or what's actually

470
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:20,760
happening with that device is in the

471
00:19:18,299 --> 00:19:23,910
read the internet in that network so we

472
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:26,669
try to do the same thing like we try to

473
00:19:23,910 --> 00:19:30,530
run a fake base station or a passive

474
00:19:26,669 --> 00:19:33,000
attacker that's actually trying to

475
00:19:30,530 --> 00:19:36,139
receive the capabilities of all the

476
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:39,809
devices in the surrounding and try to

477
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:42,270
estimate or our inclusion we guess the

478
00:19:39,809 --> 00:19:43,889
kind of maker of the baseband the model

479
00:19:42,270 --> 00:19:45,360
of the baseband the operating system

480
00:19:43,890 --> 00:19:47,640
it's running and the kind of

481
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:49,889
applications it's running and if poss

482
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:53,210
we'll also find out the version of the

483
00:19:49,890 --> 00:19:53,210
operating system that's there so

484
00:19:54,679 --> 00:19:58,030
basically this is the kind of the the

485
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:01,630
tree we build

486
00:19:58,030 --> 00:20:03,190
it it could be used at specific for

487
00:20:01,630 --> 00:20:05,260
example like I built the tree like this

488
00:20:03,190 --> 00:20:06,910
because I it was convenient for me maybe

489
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:09,760
somebody else might find out something

490
00:20:06,910 --> 00:20:12,400
else differently so basically we are

491
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:13,990
trying to find out the chip maker then

492
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:15,340
the device model operating system

493
00:20:13,990 --> 00:20:17,320
application of the device then the

494
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:19,720
basement software version also the

495
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:21,600
application operating system version so

496
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:24,490
first we find out the basement model

497
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:26,260
then we find out if it's a cellular

498
00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:28,450
device or if it's and cellular I were to

499
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:30,700
device if it's a cellular device is it a

500
00:20:28,450 --> 00:20:32,710
phone or is it some other device if it's

501
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:34,360
a phone if it's an Android I was then if

502
00:20:32,710 --> 00:20:37,330
it's Android then what kind of Android

503
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:40,240
is it Samsung HTC LG Nokia then if it's

504
00:20:37,330 --> 00:20:42,760
always like if it's a nice iPhone or an

505
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:45,340
iPad or what is the operating system

506
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:48,100
version there so we or we also try to

507
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:50,139
get that then if it's other kind of

508
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:52,750
device is it a car modem or if it's

509
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:56,230
railway modem then is it a router USB

510
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:57,790
dongle or is it a laptop or or is it the

511
00:20:56,230 --> 00:21:00,070
vending machine like a typical IOT

512
00:20:57,790 --> 00:21:01,870
device or so if it's not a cellular

513
00:21:00,070 --> 00:21:02,950
device it could be a cellular IOT device

514
00:21:01,870 --> 00:21:05,530
because these are the only two

515
00:21:02,950 --> 00:21:09,130
categories exist it could be either a

516
00:21:05,530 --> 00:21:10,690
narrowband IOT device and LTM device but

517
00:21:09,130 --> 00:21:12,220
these are quite new in the market I

518
00:21:10,690 --> 00:21:15,790
don't expect them to be in huge numbers

519
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:18,340
compared to phones we have so so this is

520
00:21:15,790 --> 00:21:21,820
kind of the kind of like and map we are

521
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:23,290
trying to do basically you can ask me

522
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:25,689
the question like how is it possible so

523
00:21:23,290 --> 00:21:27,480
there are two things the first one like

524
00:21:25,690 --> 00:21:30,580
I said the baseband manufacturers

525
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:33,280
implement these capabilities so there

526
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:34,810
are handful manufacturers for example

527
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:37,270
like maybe five we actually considered

528
00:21:34,810 --> 00:21:39,639
five in our experiments like Qualcomm

529
00:21:37,270 --> 00:21:42,129
Huawei Intel Samsung and MediaTek we

530
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:43,750
find they have the big market so they

531
00:21:42,130 --> 00:21:46,420
implement the capabilities differently

532
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:48,180
because the capabilities are optional to

533
00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:51,220
implement not all of them are mandatory

534
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:52,780
some you can skip some you can implement

535
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:55,690
it's up to you it's up to the baseband

536
00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:58,990
manufacture some can be enabled or some

537
00:21:55,690 --> 00:22:01,090
can be disabled then the second one is

538
00:21:58,990 --> 00:22:03,280
each target application requires a

539
00:22:01,090 --> 00:22:04,629
different set of capabilities mandatory

540
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:06,220
for example you take a phone it

541
00:22:04,630 --> 00:22:08,860
definitely needs the voice codec

542
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:11,140
facilities you take a USB stick it

543
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:11,840
definitely needs the data capabilities

544
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:13,880
like the data

545
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:17,600
transmission reception capabilities you

546
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:20,390
take a car like a latest car it needs

547
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:22,879
the v2x capabilities so there are

548
00:22:20,390 --> 00:22:25,159
different capabilities that are that

549
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:28,070
suits an application so these are some

550
00:22:25,159 --> 00:22:30,110
of the some of the like the fundamental

551
00:22:28,070 --> 00:22:33,230
things that allowed actually asked to do

552
00:22:30,110 --> 00:22:35,959
something of printing so we like I said

553
00:22:33,230 --> 00:22:37,909
we selected so many devices we also had

554
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:39,470
some devices some some military devices

555
00:22:37,909 --> 00:22:41,330
which showed really different

556
00:22:39,470 --> 00:22:44,360
capabilities and the traditional or the

557
00:22:41,330 --> 00:22:49,520
the commercial ones which were using we

558
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:51,049
also had modems from cars also like like

559
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:53,570
you see on the left its it's full of

560
00:22:51,049 --> 00:22:55,250
phones different phones actually the

561
00:22:53,570 --> 00:22:57,559
list is very huge but I just put only

562
00:22:55,250 --> 00:23:03,289
some of them then we have different

563
00:22:57,559 --> 00:23:05,899
routers different different USB sticks

564
00:23:03,289 --> 00:23:07,460
different laptops different yeah so many

565
00:23:05,899 --> 00:23:10,580
devices think maybe it's somewhere

566
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:12,110
around up to 80 so we actually collected

567
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:14,658
the the capabilities of all these

568
00:23:12,110 --> 00:23:16,490
devices create a huge reference model

569
00:23:14,659 --> 00:23:19,909
and then when I'm actually saving these

570
00:23:16,490 --> 00:23:22,370
capabilities I try to save based on what

571
00:23:19,909 --> 00:23:23,570
was the baseband manufacturer because in

572
00:23:22,370 --> 00:23:25,070
this case I know I'm building the

573
00:23:23,570 --> 00:23:27,830
reference model so I know everything

574
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:30,200
about in this device so once I have all

575
00:23:27,830 --> 00:23:33,500
these capabilities from so many devices

576
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:35,149
I started analyzing like looking into

577
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:37,429
that and trying to find fingerprints

578
00:23:35,149 --> 00:23:40,879
that allows me to actually differentiate

579
00:23:37,429 --> 00:23:42,860
between these devices so the first

580
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:45,770
fingerprint was to actually identify

581
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:47,959
different baseband vendors like to find

582
00:23:45,770 --> 00:23:51,320
who is the baseband maker so if you take

583
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:53,720
this table so like we have different

584
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:55,189
capabilities listed on the left if you

585
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:57,350
take the second capability which is

586
00:23:55,190 --> 00:24:00,440
called II is 0 it's a null encryption

587
00:23:57,350 --> 00:24:03,080
algorithm it's actually optional to have

588
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:04,940
this so if you take in this case

589
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:06,770
Qualcomm was the only baseband

590
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:09,380
manufacturer like to actually disable

591
00:24:06,770 --> 00:24:12,710
this in most of the devices maybe

592
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:15,559
roughly like 99.9% devices we see it was

593
00:24:12,710 --> 00:24:17,450
disabled you the rest of the basement

594
00:24:15,559 --> 00:24:19,129
see like it was always enabled so this

595
00:24:17,450 --> 00:24:22,179
would be a good thing a printer actually

596
00:24:19,130 --> 00:24:24,649
identify if this is a qualcomm device

597
00:24:22,179 --> 00:24:25,770
you take other for example like there's

598
00:24:24,649 --> 00:24:28,889
something called extend

599
00:24:25,770 --> 00:24:32,190
measurement capability so this was used

600
00:24:28,890 --> 00:24:33,960
in 2g networks this was only enabled in

601
00:24:32,190 --> 00:24:36,300
media tech I don't know the reason why

602
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:38,880
but it's it's up to the basement maker

603
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:40,139
like so if I have to find out the reason

604
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:42,450
why you implement and why you don't

605
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:44,010
implement it takes I think so many ages

606
00:24:42,450 --> 00:24:45,660
like because there are like hundreds and

607
00:24:44,010 --> 00:24:49,530
thousands of capabilities which are

608
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:51,450
optional and then mandatory or it's up

609
00:24:49,530 --> 00:24:53,820
to the baseband vendor to implement them

610
00:24:51,450 --> 00:24:55,380
so this is some something of brinstead

611
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:57,960
to actually identify different base

612
00:24:55,380 --> 00:25:02,150
bands and once you know the baseband

613
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:04,110
maker you can easily say based on the

614
00:25:02,150 --> 00:25:06,210
capabilities in that you can actually

615
00:25:04,110 --> 00:25:08,250
tell what kind of model is that for

616
00:25:06,210 --> 00:25:11,340
example like snapdragon 800 or

617
00:25:08,250 --> 00:25:13,559
Snapdragon 820 once you know that you

618
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:17,040
can actually there's a nice wiki where

619
00:25:13,559 --> 00:25:18,899
you can actually see which devices are

620
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:21,600
actually using this particular basement

621
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:26,790
model so then you have a list of devices

622
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:28,649
maybe maybe 1020 or it depends so once

623
00:25:26,790 --> 00:25:30,570
you get that now it's the time to

624
00:25:28,650 --> 00:25:33,210
identify the application of the device

625
00:25:30,570 --> 00:25:34,830
like a little bit more high 11 like what

626
00:25:33,210 --> 00:25:38,040
is the application is it a phone or is

627
00:25:34,830 --> 00:25:39,419
it like a router or something so there

628
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:41,250
are some easy differences like to

629
00:25:39,420 --> 00:25:42,990
identify between a cellular device and

630
00:25:41,250 --> 00:25:45,480
an IOT device there are certain timers

631
00:25:42,990 --> 00:25:47,880
which are always active or mandatory

632
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:50,130
should be present in IOT devices for

633
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:52,260
example like PSM timer this is something

634
00:25:50,130 --> 00:25:53,880
mandatory for IOT which is not mandatory

635
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:56,309
for because this is something to save

636
00:25:53,880 --> 00:26:00,920
power which we don't need for phones and

637
00:25:56,309 --> 00:26:03,178
cars or something then we have different

638
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:04,740
because like we want to identify phone

639
00:26:03,179 --> 00:26:07,380
specifically because there are so many

640
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:10,440
of them so phones obviously have this

641
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:11,790
voice codec feature active then when

642
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:14,640
it's connecting to the network it

643
00:26:11,790 --> 00:26:17,610
obviously enables the fact that it has

644
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:19,890
voice domain preference others like

645
00:26:17,610 --> 00:26:26,129
sometimes like it is present or it's not

646
00:26:19,890 --> 00:26:27,929
present so then sometimes like you might

647
00:26:26,130 --> 00:26:30,120
be wondering okay normally like there

648
00:26:27,929 --> 00:26:31,650
are phones which used base bands only

649
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:33,530
from a specific manufacturer like for

650
00:26:31,650 --> 00:26:37,110
example if they go away it only uses

651
00:26:33,530 --> 00:26:39,570
baseband from Huawei or Samsung only

652
00:26:37,110 --> 00:26:42,899
from I mean Samsung can also use PL for

653
00:26:39,570 --> 00:26:45,780
from basement but it also uses a Samsung

654
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:49,620
basement then Apple only two options

655
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:51,750
like either Intel Falcon then there was

656
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:53,729
okay this was this went a bit tough like

657
00:26:51,750 --> 00:26:55,410
I'm trying to find out the difference

658
00:26:53,730 --> 00:26:57,330
between Android and I was like this is

659
00:26:55,410 --> 00:26:59,700
something really needed so there are

660
00:26:57,330 --> 00:27:03,330
like two features which somehow looks

661
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:06,600
like the MS assisted GPS this was a

662
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:09,780
feature in 2g and then this was actually

663
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:12,090
disabled in I was maybe privacy reasons

664
00:27:09,780 --> 00:27:14,750
or I don't know but this was always

665
00:27:12,090 --> 00:27:17,550
enabled in most of the Android devices

666
00:27:14,750 --> 00:27:19,350
so okay this is the positive side of

667
00:27:17,550 --> 00:27:21,840
doing this fingerprinting like that

668
00:27:19,350 --> 00:27:24,899
would be also issues we faced for

669
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:26,699
example like in cases when there's a sim

670
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:30,750
car like the sim card can actually

671
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:32,460
control the enablement or disablement of

672
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:36,300
these capabilities like for example like

673
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:38,520
you said maybe sim card can actually

674
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:40,830
control what kind of bands can be active

675
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:42,530
or what kind of codecs can be active

676
00:27:40,830 --> 00:27:44,790
there are bits which you can actually

677
00:27:42,530 --> 00:27:47,850
enable in the sim card which actually

678
00:27:44,790 --> 00:27:49,800
controls the baseband so SIM card could

679
00:27:47,850 --> 00:27:54,090
be a little bit tricky part when you are

680
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:56,010
doing this fingerprinting so sometimes

681
00:27:54,090 --> 00:27:58,740
like there are there could be situations

682
00:27:56,010 --> 00:28:00,780
where the capability is between

683
00:27:58,740 --> 00:28:03,030
different devices are equally matching

684
00:28:00,780 --> 00:28:04,470
so there's no nothing to worry we have

685
00:28:03,030 --> 00:28:06,270
like thousands of capabilities to

686
00:28:04,470 --> 00:28:08,970
actually differentiate between them I

687
00:28:06,270 --> 00:28:10,200
just showed a subset here but if you

688
00:28:08,970 --> 00:28:12,680
literally if you refer to the white

689
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:14,880
paper like there are so many different

690
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:17,040
capabilities that actually allow you to

691
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:21,990
differentiate easily between so many

692
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:23,940
devices so what now so if you are able

693
00:28:21,990 --> 00:28:26,580
to find out the operating system version

694
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:28,650
or the kind of operating system its

695
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:31,199
running the kind of device it is you

696
00:28:28,650 --> 00:28:33,420
could plan a targeted attack or if you

697
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:35,310
are looking for a specific device like I

698
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:38,070
said some some devices for example if

699
00:28:35,310 --> 00:28:39,780
you take devices which are used in field

700
00:28:38,070 --> 00:28:41,730
testing they have completely different

701
00:28:39,780 --> 00:28:45,389
set of capabilities from the traditional

702
00:28:41,730 --> 00:28:46,320
devices which we see in the market so if

703
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:48,540
you are looking for some specific

704
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:50,550
devices it is easy to find with certain

705
00:28:48,540 --> 00:28:52,379
fingerprints or if you are looking for a

706
00:28:50,550 --> 00:28:53,290
military device it is also easily for

707
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:55,600
I'm not showing them

708
00:28:53,290 --> 00:28:56,970
but if you're interested we can we talk

709
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:59,590
about it

710
00:28:56,970 --> 00:29:01,390
so the and the good thing is like we are

711
00:28:59,590 --> 00:29:04,419
actually trying to release this tool

712
00:29:01,390 --> 00:29:07,030
just open it but not not the man in the

713
00:29:04,420 --> 00:29:09,940
middle doing thing part but but once you

714
00:29:07,030 --> 00:29:11,170
have the capabilities how we create an

715
00:29:09,940 --> 00:29:13,810
automated tool like that actually

716
00:29:11,170 --> 00:29:16,240
analyzes and then gives you an nmap like

717
00:29:13,810 --> 00:29:17,590
result like and then you just feed the

718
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:19,720
capabilities and then it will give you

719
00:29:17,590 --> 00:29:22,770
what kind of device it is and then what

720
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:25,930
what what does it do and all this stuff

721
00:29:22,770 --> 00:29:28,090
so this was the first fingerprinting MA

722
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:31,060
attack then the second one was bidding

723
00:29:28,090 --> 00:29:32,830
down attack like I said the capabilities

724
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:35,020
are actually the radio access

725
00:29:32,830 --> 00:29:38,500
capabilities which actually define the

726
00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:43,240
speed that that your device is receiving

727
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:46,180
for example like you take an iPhone

728
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:48,790
which is an iPhone 10 like it's it's

729
00:29:46,180 --> 00:29:50,590
supposed to receive speeds theoretically

730
00:29:48,790 --> 00:29:54,879
it's supposed to receive speeds up to 1

731
00:29:50,590 --> 00:29:56,620
Gbps theoretically but some networks

732
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:58,750
like they don't support that speeds yet

733
00:29:56,620 --> 00:30:00,729
so practically you might see maybe in

734
00:29:58,750 --> 00:30:04,510
busy hours like you might see maximum 60

735
00:30:00,730 --> 00:30:06,550
M EPS or 70 it depends on the network

736
00:30:04,510 --> 00:30:07,930
operator and the kind of maybe if you

737
00:30:06,550 --> 00:30:11,770
are operating it on the midnight like

738
00:30:07,930 --> 00:30:14,920
you see maybe 200 Mbps very rare but if

739
00:30:11,770 --> 00:30:17,230
you're lucky so the radio is something

740
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:20,230
that's actually controlling the speed of

741
00:30:17,230 --> 00:30:22,840
what the speed what your device is

742
00:30:20,230 --> 00:30:25,120
getting so if you try to kill that that

743
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:28,840
radio thing you you are really affecting

744
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:32,560
the service that's actually to this

745
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:34,720
device so in this case like the network

746
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:37,330
is actually asking the base station to

747
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:40,270
get the capabilities so the phone would

748
00:30:37,330 --> 00:30:43,800
actually send the capabilities so if you

749
00:30:40,270 --> 00:30:43,800
are operating a man-in-the-middle relay

750
00:30:43,950 --> 00:30:48,130
so there's a relay in between which is

751
00:30:46,450 --> 00:30:50,500
trying to modify these capabilities

752
00:30:48,130 --> 00:30:53,020
because in this case the security is

753
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:55,650
actually kicking in after the

754
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:58,210
capabilities are sent to the network so

755
00:30:55,650 --> 00:31:00,280
this is not a standard defined procedure

756
00:30:58,210 --> 00:31:02,680
this was kind of an implementation

757
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:05,200
specific but the standard also mentions

758
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:07,040
that you can access these capabilities

759
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:09,260
without even having security

760
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:11,810
so it's up to the operator to implement

761
00:31:09,260 --> 00:31:14,660
this some operators can actually

762
00:31:11,810 --> 00:31:17,659
implement after having security some can

763
00:31:14,660 --> 00:31:20,180
do it before security so I will show

764
00:31:17,660 --> 00:31:21,770
some results after this so basically the

765
00:31:20,180 --> 00:31:26,480
the relay is trying to modify these

766
00:31:21,770 --> 00:31:28,310
capabilities and the phone neither the

767
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:30,050
phone not the base station not the core

768
00:31:28,310 --> 00:31:31,730
network can actually detect that this

769
00:31:30,050 --> 00:31:34,580
kind of modification actually happened

770
00:31:31,730 --> 00:31:36,260
so what happens the base station get the

771
00:31:34,580 --> 00:31:38,480
capabilities it will send it to the

772
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:39,920
network like to the core network and the

773
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:43,580
core network actually saves these

774
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:45,200
capabilities how long it it depends on

775
00:31:43,580 --> 00:31:47,810
the configuration but what we have seen

776
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:50,750
is up to until you restart your phone

777
00:31:47,810 --> 00:31:52,340
it's saving at that core network and

778
00:31:50,750 --> 00:31:53,840
then whenever the base station is

779
00:31:52,340 --> 00:31:56,540
actually asking for the capabilities it

780
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:58,220
would send back because the base station

781
00:31:56,540 --> 00:32:00,430
needs these capabilities to do some

782
00:31:58,220 --> 00:32:04,250
optimization over the air

783
00:32:00,430 --> 00:32:05,270
so once the capabilities are modified

784
00:32:04,250 --> 00:32:09,140
for example like what kind of

785
00:32:05,270 --> 00:32:10,970
modification we do we change the first

786
00:32:09,140 --> 00:32:14,840
thing we change is like we change the

787
00:32:10,970 --> 00:32:18,020
category like I said higher processing

788
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:19,459
device has higher category not exactly

789
00:32:18,020 --> 00:32:22,040
all the time but there are devices like

790
00:32:19,460 --> 00:32:24,260
cat 19 and cat 20 which were recently

791
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:26,840
defined by the standard they are

792
00:32:24,260 --> 00:32:28,400
generally referred to IOT devices so if

793
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:30,620
you are taking like the the higher

794
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:33,050
processing device like like Samsung

795
00:32:30,620 --> 00:32:35,629
Galaxy S 9 something it is actually a

796
00:32:33,050 --> 00:32:37,430
cat 12 or cat 16 device so we are trying

797
00:32:35,630 --> 00:32:40,070
to replace the category we are trying to

798
00:32:37,430 --> 00:32:43,490
put it to cat one so cat one is nothing

799
00:32:40,070 --> 00:32:44,840
but the device like which operates like

800
00:32:43,490 --> 00:32:47,060
and I were to device so this category

801
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:48,889
was defined for I would be and then you

802
00:32:47,060 --> 00:32:50,240
are trying to remove the capabilities

803
00:32:48,890 --> 00:32:52,910
for example like the carrier aggregation

804
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:55,100
or the my more multi-input multi-output

805
00:32:52,910 --> 00:32:57,200
systems these are some of the new

806
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:59,330
technologies which were used in 5g to

807
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:00,860
actually boost speed so you receive

808
00:32:59,330 --> 00:33:04,659
signals from multiple places and then

809
00:33:00,860 --> 00:33:07,790
this actually helps boosting speed in 4G

810
00:33:04,660 --> 00:33:10,010
so we try to disable this then we remove

811
00:33:07,790 --> 00:33:12,980
frequency bands like if you are an LTE

812
00:33:10,010 --> 00:33:17,360
you you are you should support certain

813
00:33:12,980 --> 00:33:19,420
bands at least two so you can have

814
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:20,770
handovers and stuff like this

815
00:33:19,420 --> 00:33:23,410
and then we have something called

816
00:33:20,770 --> 00:33:25,600
voiceover LTE which was specifically

817
00:33:23,410 --> 00:33:27,880
making voice calls or sip based voice

818
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:30,189
calls on LTE or else you have to go back

819
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:32,560
to 2g or 3G and then do voice calling so

820
00:33:30,190 --> 00:33:34,510
being a man-in-the-middle attack car we

821
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:36,760
try to remove all these capabilities and

822
00:33:34,510 --> 00:33:38,560
completely go undetected because there

823
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:41,860
was no integrity protection so a

824
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:44,080
modification cannot be detected so this

825
00:33:41,860 --> 00:33:46,030
is a screen shot I have this special

826
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:47,620
phone which actually shows you the

827
00:33:46,030 --> 00:33:50,040
traces that are actually happening

828
00:33:47,620 --> 00:33:52,719
between so this is from one Operator

829
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:54,790
so what we see here is like the the

830
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:56,350
capability is actually being the

831
00:33:54,790 --> 00:33:58,780
capabilities I request set before the

832
00:33:56,350 --> 00:34:00,669
security mode command so which gives an

833
00:33:58,780 --> 00:34:05,110
attacker an advantage to actually modify

834
00:34:00,670 --> 00:34:07,090
them so we try to test this on different

835
00:34:05,110 --> 00:34:08,889
networks even though it doesn't really

836
00:34:07,090 --> 00:34:10,690
matter like if you are having an elite

837
00:34:08,889 --> 00:34:13,000
SIM card because sometimes like if you

838
00:34:10,690 --> 00:34:15,400
are having a very very good SIM card or

839
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:17,860
like any connection you get really good

840
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:21,040
speed even if you are in a big fest or

841
00:34:17,860 --> 00:34:23,410
or a big venue like this because you are

842
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:24,790
entitled to receive so even having an

843
00:34:23,409 --> 00:34:27,639
elite SIM card doesn't give you more

844
00:34:24,790 --> 00:34:29,739
speed if your device doesn't support so

845
00:34:27,639 --> 00:34:32,620
we tried some experiments with iPhone 8

846
00:34:29,739 --> 00:34:34,178
and then also a Netgear router both are

847
00:34:32,620 --> 00:34:36,549
actually Qualcomm base so this doesn't

848
00:34:34,179 --> 00:34:38,950
really apply to Qualcomm but it applies

849
00:34:36,550 --> 00:34:41,200
to everybody so it's a problem with the

850
00:34:38,949 --> 00:34:44,830
with the network operators and it's not

851
00:34:41,199 --> 00:34:46,509
the problem with the baseband so what we

852
00:34:44,830 --> 00:34:48,159
see what we saw was like once the

853
00:34:46,510 --> 00:34:50,800
capabilities are modified the speed was

854
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:52,989
reduced from I mean normally it was

855
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:55,030
supposed to receive 48 MVPs but it

856
00:34:52,989 --> 00:34:56,799
actually receives like 2 Mbps this was

857
00:34:55,030 --> 00:34:59,350
somewhere in mid night but if you test

858
00:34:56,800 --> 00:35:02,980
in like normal high peak traffic time I

859
00:34:59,350 --> 00:35:05,500
think you cannot even open Gmail or

860
00:35:02,980 --> 00:35:08,710
which it makes it difficult it goes to

861
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:10,540
kbps P so why so many calls are denied

862
00:35:08,710 --> 00:35:12,580
so whenever we make a voice call in the

863
00:35:10,540 --> 00:35:14,380
situation the phone is kicking back to

864
00:35:12,580 --> 00:35:17,350
2g because it doesn't support voice or

865
00:35:14,380 --> 00:35:19,180
LT then handovers like it's not being

866
00:35:17,350 --> 00:35:20,799
handed over to a 4G base station but

867
00:35:19,180 --> 00:35:22,450
it's being handed over to a 2g base

868
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:25,270
station because the phone doesn't

869
00:35:22,450 --> 00:35:28,390
support base it doesn't support LTE

870
00:35:25,270 --> 00:35:29,650
bands so these are like this is

871
00:35:28,390 --> 00:35:32,060
something like you're killing the

872
00:35:29,650 --> 00:35:36,680
service and then you are actually

873
00:35:32,060 --> 00:35:38,470
downgrading the device so to keep it

874
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:41,600
simple like you're actually connecting a

875
00:35:38,470 --> 00:35:44,390
high-end device like like an I were to

876
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:47,299
device and then you are killing the

877
00:35:44,390 --> 00:35:49,609
speed and then you're downgrading it so

878
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:51,710
like it like I said we tried on

879
00:35:49,610 --> 00:35:53,510
different networks different different

880
00:35:51,710 --> 00:35:55,720
countries and different continents so

881
00:35:53,510 --> 00:35:57,530
trendy dude networks were actually

882
00:35:55,720 --> 00:36:00,580
requesting the capabilities before

883
00:35:57,530 --> 00:36:04,640
security so which are actually affected

884
00:36:00,580 --> 00:36:07,160
and then the main problem here was the

885
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:08,750
persistence of the attack like because

886
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:12,620
the network is actually storing these

887
00:36:08,750 --> 00:36:14,420
capabilities maybe seven days the kind

888
00:36:12,620 --> 00:36:16,640
of experiments we did so one week

889
00:36:14,420 --> 00:36:19,670
untimely until unless like I restart my

890
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:23,600
device it's not gonna regain the service

891
00:36:19,670 --> 00:36:25,730
back um like I said like the radio is a

892
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:28,520
bottleneck for high speed data services

893
00:36:25,730 --> 00:36:30,830
so this applies for any kind of high

894
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:33,230
speed device you can also test it with

895
00:36:30,830 --> 00:36:36,110
IOT devices but anyways like a motor

896
00:36:33,230 --> 00:36:38,450
devices are made for operating on low

897
00:36:36,110 --> 00:36:40,700
speeds so it doesn't really affect them

898
00:36:38,450 --> 00:36:43,609
or it doesn't really bother I were to

899
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:45,740
devices I think this is more targeted

900
00:36:43,610 --> 00:36:47,570
towards high speed devices so you might

901
00:36:45,740 --> 00:36:50,629
ask me like the question like okay why

902
00:36:47,570 --> 00:36:52,880
is the standard allowing you to actually

903
00:36:50,630 --> 00:36:56,140
send the capabilities before security so

904
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:58,730
there are reasons for example like to do

905
00:36:56,140 --> 00:37:00,830
optimization prior to security like

906
00:36:58,730 --> 00:37:04,600
optimize the radio network so that the

907
00:37:00,830 --> 00:37:04,600
later data connection like goes smooth

908
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:12,350
this was I think one of the reason we

909
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:13,850
found in the standards yep so the third

910
00:37:12,350 --> 00:37:16,040
attack is something we are doing with

911
00:37:13,850 --> 00:37:17,750
the battery drain so there are new

912
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:21,470
device in the market called narrowband

913
00:37:17,750 --> 00:37:22,820
IOT devices these are and they have a

914
00:37:21,470 --> 00:37:25,370
special feature something called power

915
00:37:22,820 --> 00:37:27,260
saving mode so basically the device and

916
00:37:25,370 --> 00:37:29,839
these are the devices like you found in

917
00:37:27,260 --> 00:37:31,880
you find in like smart metering or or in

918
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:34,490
applications where the device is sending

919
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:36,410
just few bytes of data and then not and

920
00:37:34,490 --> 00:37:40,160
has nothing to do after that for maybe

921
00:37:36,410 --> 00:37:43,629
like one week or something also even

922
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:46,069
smart grids so basically the device

923
00:37:43,630 --> 00:37:48,080
enables this power saving mode

924
00:37:46,070 --> 00:37:50,870
with the help of the network and then it

925
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:52,880
sends some data and then goes off some

926
00:37:50,870 --> 00:37:53,330
defined amount of time maybe a week or

927
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:56,060
something

928
00:37:53,330 --> 00:37:58,460
so basically being a man-in-the-middle

929
00:37:56,060 --> 00:38:00,950
what we are trying to do is like we are

930
00:37:58,460 --> 00:38:03,260
modifying the capabilities since there

931
00:38:00,950 --> 00:38:06,049
is no like I said since the security is

932
00:38:03,260 --> 00:38:08,360
actually kicking after the exchange of

933
00:38:06,050 --> 00:38:10,940
capabilities so we try to remove this

934
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:13,190
the power saving mode so the problem

935
00:38:10,940 --> 00:38:14,810
here was like the phone is okay even

936
00:38:13,190 --> 00:38:17,510
though if the phone supports the power

937
00:38:14,810 --> 00:38:19,700
saving mode it doesn't activate unless

938
00:38:17,510 --> 00:38:22,340
until the network is telling to do so

939
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:24,649
and the network doesn't activate the

940
00:38:22,340 --> 00:38:27,560
power saving mode unless until it knows

941
00:38:24,650 --> 00:38:30,260
that the device supports so what happens

942
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:31,759
here is like the base station the the

943
00:38:30,260 --> 00:38:35,150
the relay or the the man in the middle

944
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:36,830
is trying to disable it so network

945
00:38:35,150 --> 00:38:39,260
thinks that it doesn't support any power

946
00:38:36,830 --> 00:38:42,140
saving mode so the device is actually on

947
00:38:39,260 --> 00:38:44,240
for the rest of the period when it's on

948
00:38:42,140 --> 00:38:46,940
what what a modem is doing is like it's

949
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:49,729
just trying to read neighbor cells like

950
00:38:46,940 --> 00:38:51,680
do some measurements always trying to

951
00:38:49,730 --> 00:38:53,210
scan for new new base stations and then

952
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:55,160
trying to camp on them so this is kind

953
00:38:53,210 --> 00:38:58,850
of like wasting power actually which is

954
00:38:55,160 --> 00:39:00,379
not really the main purpose of designing

955
00:38:58,850 --> 00:39:03,140
these type of devices because they are

956
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:05,510
destined to operate for 10 years on a

957
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:08,060
single battery or on a triple a size

958
00:39:05,510 --> 00:39:09,740
like two batteries but what we saw in

959
00:39:08,060 --> 00:39:11,810
our experiments was like we are killing

960
00:39:09,740 --> 00:39:13,939
the battery life time by like five times

961
00:39:11,810 --> 00:39:15,650
and then again the problem is with the

962
00:39:13,940 --> 00:39:17,330
persistence like it doesn't go away if

963
00:39:15,650 --> 00:39:18,680
the attacker is gone because the

964
00:39:17,330 --> 00:39:22,040
capabilities are actually stored at the

965
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:25,879
network so you have to manually restart

966
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:28,370
the iwata device like which is I can

967
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:30,080
imagine like hard to do it and then this

968
00:39:28,370 --> 00:39:32,109
drains the battery like very quickly and

969
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:34,700
the problem was like this was not able

970
00:39:32,110 --> 00:39:39,650
this was this cannot be like detected

971
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:41,509
either by the phone or the network so

972
00:39:39,650 --> 00:39:43,730
this was a problem that was existing in

973
00:39:41,510 --> 00:39:45,790
the first release of narrow binary

974
00:39:43,730 --> 00:39:48,760
devices like it was called release 13

975
00:39:45,790 --> 00:39:51,380
then release 14 there was a fix for that

976
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:54,590
so all these vulnerabilities like we

977
00:39:51,380 --> 00:39:57,230
actually reported to the GSMA and also

978
00:39:54,590 --> 00:39:59,950
the 3gpp sh3 which is doing security

979
00:39:57,230 --> 00:40:04,420
part and also all the effect that when

980
00:39:59,950 --> 00:40:07,330
and even operators and actually I should

981
00:40:04,420 --> 00:40:08,860
thank GSMA like the process of reporting

982
00:40:07,330 --> 00:40:12,160
the vulnerability was very smooth and

983
00:40:08,860 --> 00:40:14,590
then we could get the fix I think in one

984
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:17,799
month so there was also like a fix in

985
00:40:14,590 --> 00:40:20,350
the standard by the sh3 so now the

986
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:22,930
network has to replace the capabilities

987
00:40:20,350 --> 00:40:24,960
only after establishing a security so

988
00:40:22,930 --> 00:40:28,330
this this should be something done

989
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:31,780
updated or by the by the operators too

990
00:40:28,330 --> 00:40:33,190
but even though with this fixed still

991
00:40:31,780 --> 00:40:36,640
the fingerprinting attacks are possible

992
00:40:33,190 --> 00:40:38,560
on hygiene I think I just forgot

993
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:42,069
mentioned because the narrowband IOT

994
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:44,140
testbed we used was something we don't

995
00:40:42,070 --> 00:40:46,390
have any like open-source implementation

996
00:40:44,140 --> 00:40:50,529
of the narrowband IOT network so we

997
00:40:46,390 --> 00:40:52,390
approached a vendor like an operator so

998
00:40:50,530 --> 00:40:54,600
we could borrow equipment and then do

999
00:40:52,390 --> 00:40:58,870
some man-in-the-middle attack with that

1000
00:40:54,600 --> 00:41:00,490
but LT like for 4G like we have some

1001
00:40:58,870 --> 00:41:01,870
kind of devices like some kind of

1002
00:41:00,490 --> 00:41:03,430
open-source software which where we

1003
00:41:01,870 --> 00:41:09,580
could actually do the attacks and see

1004
00:41:03,430 --> 00:41:13,810
how it's working so like I said then the

1005
00:41:09,580 --> 00:41:15,009
end map is still possible on 5g there

1006
00:41:13,810 --> 00:41:17,470
was some kind of discussion which

1007
00:41:15,010 --> 00:41:19,210
started in in 5g regarding fixing this

1008
00:41:17,470 --> 00:41:20,950
capabilities because being a passive

1009
00:41:19,210 --> 00:41:22,750
attacker you can actually listen to

1010
00:41:20,950 --> 00:41:24,970
thousands of capabilities and just

1011
00:41:22,750 --> 00:41:29,110
fingerprint like what device is this and

1012
00:41:24,970 --> 00:41:30,549
everything but I hope maybe in a in one

1013
00:41:29,110 --> 00:41:32,800
year or something there should be a fix

1014
00:41:30,550 --> 00:41:34,570
for this but it's a basic problem it's a

1015
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:38,050
fundamental problem which was already it

1016
00:41:34,570 --> 00:41:40,480
was there and which which might increase

1017
00:41:38,050 --> 00:41:42,670
because it's 5g like you have more

1018
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:45,340
applications coming in and then you have

1019
00:41:42,670 --> 00:41:47,830
more capabilities that are actually

1020
00:41:45,340 --> 00:41:49,450
exactly defining what kind of device it

1021
00:41:47,830 --> 00:41:51,580
is so you don't have to do this much of

1022
00:41:49,450 --> 00:41:53,140
fingerprinting if you are going in for

1023
00:41:51,580 --> 00:41:54,970
example like take 20 21

1024
00:41:53,140 --> 00:41:56,470
if you don't define this then the

1025
00:41:54,970 --> 00:41:59,649
fingerprinting becomes more easy because

1026
00:41:56,470 --> 00:42:01,149
the capabilities can really say just by

1027
00:41:59,650 --> 00:42:06,940
looking at that you can really say what

1028
00:42:01,150 --> 00:42:09,610
kind of devices so for fixes like like I

1029
00:42:06,940 --> 00:42:11,800
said I think the current versions of

1030
00:42:09,610 --> 00:42:13,840
narrowband IOT don't really have the fix

1031
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:15,610
for this the fixes like

1032
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:17,140
the device is sending the cable

1033
00:42:15,610 --> 00:42:18,850
coordinate for capabilities to the

1034
00:42:17,140 --> 00:42:21,009
network and the network would replay

1035
00:42:18,850 --> 00:42:23,230
them back to the device after

1036
00:42:21,010 --> 00:42:25,030
establishing the security so so that you

1037
00:42:23,230 --> 00:42:26,440
can actually verify if the the

1038
00:42:25,030 --> 00:42:29,740
capabilities they're actually modified

1039
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:31,480
in the beginning so like a hash of them

1040
00:42:29,740 --> 00:42:35,830
so this is actually in there in the

1041
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:37,870
standards now but I haven't seen any any

1042
00:42:35,830 --> 00:42:39,759
vendor actually implementing them so

1043
00:42:37,870 --> 00:42:41,650
it's it's a release 14 so kind of quite

1044
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:45,070
quite new so maybe next year or

1045
00:42:41,650 --> 00:42:47,350
something we should see and I'm not

1046
00:42:45,070 --> 00:42:49,120
really aware of I'm actually aware of

1047
00:42:47,350 --> 00:42:51,580
some operators like which are actually

1048
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:53,410
out of those 22 I'm actually aware of

1049
00:42:51,580 --> 00:42:54,819
some of them but I don't really know who

1050
00:42:53,410 --> 00:42:56,410
is the vendor or something because I

1051
00:42:54,820 --> 00:42:59,740
couldn't get enough information from

1052
00:42:56,410 --> 00:43:03,910
from the standards or the GSMA like it

1053
00:42:59,740 --> 00:43:06,339
was kind of kept secret or so obviously

1054
00:43:03,910 --> 00:43:07,509
you have to implement I we are not

1055
00:43:06,340 --> 00:43:09,820
really sure if it's an implementation

1056
00:43:07,510 --> 00:43:11,830
problem or if it's a configuration

1057
00:43:09,820 --> 00:43:15,490
problem so both really have implications

1058
00:43:11,830 --> 00:43:18,160
on this and changing them I think would

1059
00:43:15,490 --> 00:43:25,180
really solve the the second and third

1060
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:27,100
attacks yeah so that's it about the new

1061
00:43:25,180 --> 00:43:31,299
attacks we found on 5g networks and then

1062
00:43:27,100 --> 00:43:35,670
I let's see what what comes in the in

1063
00:43:31,300 --> 00:43:35,670
the future on five thank you
