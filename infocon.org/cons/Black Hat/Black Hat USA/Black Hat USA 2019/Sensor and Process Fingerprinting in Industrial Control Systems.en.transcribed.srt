00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,580
good afternoon everyone welcome to you

2
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:07,830
sensor and process fingerprinting in

3
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:11,519
industrial control systems with Martina

4
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:13,559
Choa before we begin just a free brief

5
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:16,830
notes stop at the business hall located

6
00:00:13,559 --> 00:00:19,590
in Mandalay Bay Oceanside and shoreline

7
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:20,820
Baldwin's level 2 during the day and the

8
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:24,810
welcome perception tonight we'll be

9
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:27,480
there at 5:30 p.m. the black hat Arsenal

10
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:29,640
is in the business hall level 2 you can

11
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:34,850
also join us for the pony Awards in

12
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:37,469
lagoon jk jk L at 6:30 p.m. tonight

13
00:00:34,850 --> 00:00:39,270
please silence your cell phone we

14
00:00:37,469 --> 00:00:41,129
appreciate that and give a warm welcome

15
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:47,280
to our speaker today Martina Cho thank

16
00:00:41,129 --> 00:00:49,320
you ok thanks Angela for the intro

17
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:52,170
welcome everyone it's my pleasure to be

18
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:53,789
here plaque that so yeah my name is

19
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:55,649
Martina - I'll be talking about sensor

20
00:00:53,789 --> 00:00:58,350
and process fingerprinting in the sir

21
00:00:55,649 --> 00:01:01,680
control systems and just so you have an

22
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:05,129
idea on our background so this is a talk

23
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:07,950
together with Jeep Chaudhary so I'm

24
00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:10,320
leading a research group in industry at

25
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:13,799
six Terra right now but not so long ago

26
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:16,048
I was actually in academia so I was

27
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:18,780
assistant professor in Singapore where I

28
00:01:16,049 --> 00:01:20,670
was supervising Najib's PhD thesis on

29
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:23,400
the topic I'm going to speak about today

30
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:25,560
and my background is from math and

31
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:30,110
systems engineering while the gypsy's on

32
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:33,570
electric engineering and yeah so let's

33
00:01:30,110 --> 00:01:36,420
start so I guess you know if you came to

34
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:39,389
the start today I don't have to convince

35
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:40,950
you right that ICS security is important

36
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:44,220
critical infrastructure security is

37
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:47,250
important it is not so hard to you know

38
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:52,770
imagine catastrophic scenarios in the

39
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:54,960
domain of say nuclear power and so on so

40
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:57,960
I hope I hope that's that you are all

41
00:01:54,960 --> 00:02:01,320
agree with me and that perhaps what you

42
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:03,360
know is not so obvious is that other

43
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:07,110
domains like water water distribution

44
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:09,508
are also very critical so it's harder to

45
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:12,300
see like you know things exploding here

46
00:02:09,508 --> 00:02:15,149
but there's for instance

47
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:18,030
our favorite example in this domain is

48
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:19,910
the minutiae Shire incident in Australia

49
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:23,940
it's a couple of decades ago already

50
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:27,650
where this gruntled employee was hacking

51
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:32,460
unto this water treatment system and was

52
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:37,970
managed to Spiegel you know raw sewage

53
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:40,230
into reverse parts and even a hotel so

54
00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:41,580
you know it's also it's also very

55
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:43,829
critical to secure those those

56
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:45,180
infrastructures and in fact we are here

57
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:47,370
in Las Vegas in the middle of the desert

58
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:49,890
like imagine what will happen if we

59
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:52,590
suddenly don't have access to drinkable

60
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:54,959
water that's kind of very critical all

61
00:02:52,590 --> 00:03:00,870
right so I hope I hope you're agree with

62
00:02:54,960 --> 00:03:03,660
me on that on the other hand we all have

63
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:07,560
probably engineering research IT

64
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:09,030
background we tend to dislike noise like

65
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:12,330
noise is something we want to minimize

66
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:17,250
we want to get rid of because it's

67
00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:19,770
unwanted unpleasant but I hope I can

68
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:21,480
convince you to this talk that noise can

69
00:03:19,770 --> 00:03:23,580
actually be useful you can leverage

70
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:27,959
noise to improve the security of

71
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:30,660
industrial control systems so what do I

72
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:32,580
mean by not here just to give you a

73
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:35,940
little preview on the following slides

74
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:38,760
so so imagine you have an ultrasonic

75
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:40,950
sensor placed in front of a wall in

76
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:43,170
either the wall or the ultrasonic sensor

77
00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:45,750
are moving they're a constant physical

78
00:03:43,170 --> 00:03:48,269
distance however you will see that the

79
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:51,420
measurement might oscillate a lot if you

80
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:53,010
sample sensor readings you will see that

81
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:54,899
the measurement is not always exactly

82
00:03:53,010 --> 00:03:57,570
the same there will be a little bit of

83
00:03:54,900 --> 00:04:00,750
variation and that oscillation is nice

84
00:03:57,570 --> 00:04:03,359
right so it's not exactly the physical

85
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:08,580
distance but it's some kind of physical

86
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:12,570
distance plus minus ever so what I want

87
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:15,690
to do today is to first walk you through

88
00:04:12,570 --> 00:04:17,070
a test but let's all SWAT that is in the

89
00:04:15,690 --> 00:04:18,719
Singapore University of Technology and

90
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:20,370
design where we did a bunch of

91
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,700
experiments I want to walk you through

92
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:24,570
that

93
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:27,650
test bed discuss how we can attack this

94
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:30,000
test bed by spoofing sensor data and

95
00:04:27,650 --> 00:04:32,940
then I want to walk you through some

96
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,710
known control measures both from the

97
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:37,650
applied world and the research world to

98
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:40,289
this problem and I want to introduce how

99
00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:42,599
to how we can leverage the noise rock we

100
00:04:40,290 --> 00:04:45,870
can explode noise to raise the bar gets

101
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:47,070
attached all right and then I will have

102
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:50,880
some discussion about more advanced

103
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:53,479
attacks and so on so what is SWAT SWAT

104
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:55,860
stands for secure water treatment and

105
00:04:53,479 --> 00:04:57,300
it's a water treatment testbed that was

106
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:59,100
built

107
00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:02,580
general generously sponsored by a

108
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:05,010
Singapore government to do cyber

109
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:07,620
security research so this is mainly for

110
00:05:05,010 --> 00:05:12,110
cyber security research and it's been

111
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:13,970
around since 2015 it has six stages of

112
00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:21,360
processing including

113
00:05:13,970 --> 00:05:25,620
UV chemical treatment filtration so by

114
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:27,240
the way this the specs of the plant data

115
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:28,680
coming from the plan are pretty open you

116
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:32,130
can go and download them if you want to

117
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:33,630
check that out this is meant to be you

118
00:05:32,130 --> 00:05:39,840
know public research while we're doing

119
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:42,479
that and in fact let me show you a quick

120
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:45,510
video on how the plan looks like so this

121
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:48,270
is a room in the university you see this

122
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:50,669
big tank over there that's about 2,000

123
00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:52,890
liters of water and we have all the six

124
00:05:50,669 --> 00:05:55,409
stages of processing so essentially raw

125
00:05:52,890 --> 00:05:57,300
water is coming into the plant and then

126
00:05:55,410 --> 00:05:59,310
the plant cleans the water translate

127
00:05:57,300 --> 00:06:02,300
into drinkable water the other end here

128
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:06,090
we have an operator control room HMI and

129
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:07,289
it's great to have this plant because if

130
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:10,080
you want to do applied research in this

131
00:06:07,289 --> 00:06:13,260
domain it's very hard to get access to

132
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:14,490
such a system right so people are scared

133
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:17,450
that you're going to break something as

134
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:21,630
a researcher and you know rightfully so

135
00:06:17,450 --> 00:06:25,380
and this plant is very similar to a

136
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:26,880
real-world plant using from fermenting

137
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:30,539
this company so the actual there was a

138
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:32,099
tender to build this plant that was won

139
00:06:30,539 --> 00:06:34,710
by a company that was just building real

140
00:06:32,099 --> 00:06:36,360
plants and the specs were

141
00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:38,820
defined together with a utilities

142
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:41,160
company so this is this is not just a

143
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:44,599
toy plant I mean the size maybe is not

144
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:49,380
as big as a real plant but it's pretty

145
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:51,300
good so from a network perspective don't

146
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:53,190
worry about the small print just want to

147
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:55,650
highlight that all the fund so all the

148
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:58,440
physical processes are inside this far

149
00:06:55,650 --> 00:07:01,020
wall here and there are a couple of sub

150
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:02,960
networks for instance the network that

151
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:05,520
connects sensors and actuators to the

152
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:06,960
programmable logic controllers the PLC's

153
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:09,780
so the computers the notes there are

154
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:13,260
controlling the port the process is

155
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:15,059
probably LC or network and then the

156
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:16,830
network that connects the nodes among

157
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:19,979
each other so the PLC's among each other

158
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:22,080
is probably l1 network right and of

159
00:07:19,979 --> 00:07:24,150
course you know we have firewall because

160
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:26,698
we don't want to expose these to Iran or

161
00:07:24,150 --> 00:07:32,219
you know to Internet we want to protect

162
00:07:26,699 --> 00:07:34,770
it right so of course we want to protect

163
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:36,780
the perimeter and you know I thought

164
00:07:34,770 --> 00:07:38,190
since this is my first blackhat talk I

165
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:41,609
want you to keep it brief for you guys

166
00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:43,229
so this is the main takeaway and with

167
00:07:41,610 --> 00:07:47,570
this I conclude my talk thank you for

168
00:07:43,229 --> 00:07:50,789
watch I take a question sorry all right

169
00:07:47,570 --> 00:07:53,610
so right so why do we need

170
00:07:50,789 --> 00:07:55,409
defense-in-depth in ICS so there are

171
00:07:53,610 --> 00:07:57,120
couple of reasons this picture I swear

172
00:07:55,410 --> 00:07:59,970
is not made up I took it from our

173
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:01,410
marketing blog that was actually

174
00:07:59,970 --> 00:08:05,250
highlighting how cool it is that you can

175
00:08:01,410 --> 00:08:06,000
control your platform Starbucks but of

176
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:07,949
course you know our security

177
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:12,300
professionals we think this is very you

178
00:08:07,949 --> 00:08:13,979
know fun and so we have a combination of

179
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:15,660
ICS pause when you like tip was the

180
00:08:13,979 --> 00:08:20,389
internet that is there is challenging

181
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:22,919
for security and we also have motivated

182
00:08:20,389 --> 00:08:25,440
attackers inside threats in secure

183
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:26,820
updates supply chain apart all the

184
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:30,719
things we have seen in the media the

185
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:33,958
past few years and on top of that we

186
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:36,120
have traditionally a lack of

187
00:08:33,958 --> 00:08:41,250
authentication and security are these

188
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:42,659
deep network field network levels so I'm

189
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:44,970
going to explain what I mean exactly by

190
00:08:42,659 --> 00:08:49,560
that but this is a combination we

191
00:08:44,970 --> 00:08:52,350
currently in ICS so I wanted to give you

192
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:55,109
like a small 101 on how cyber-physical

193
00:08:52,350 --> 00:08:58,649
system work this is an inertial control

194
00:08:55,110 --> 00:09:04,709
system so essentially you have here an

195
00:08:58,649 --> 00:09:06,029
example of a water tank okay some of you

196
00:09:04,709 --> 00:09:07,878
are already thinking this is very boring

197
00:09:06,029 --> 00:09:11,389
it's just at your time going up and down

198
00:09:07,879 --> 00:09:14,879
but but this is actually our favorite

199
00:09:11,389 --> 00:09:17,220
part of the plant to experiment with for

200
00:09:14,879 --> 00:09:21,029
a couple of reasons so we think it

201
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:22,589
generalizes the kind of the problem to

202
00:09:21,029 --> 00:09:24,839
other parts of the plant and actually if

203
00:09:22,589 --> 00:09:26,490
you manage to damage this pump or to

204
00:09:24,839 --> 00:09:28,230
overflow the time this is actually

205
00:09:26,490 --> 00:09:30,420
causing physical damage you can break

206
00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:31,949
this sponsorship and see if you can fill

207
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:34,860
out the lab you can produce an

208
00:09:31,949 --> 00:09:36,000
availability problem and and so on and

209
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:38,790
on the other hand we don't want to do

210
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:41,100
this on the chemical tanks for obvious

211
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:42,810
reasons because we don't want to you

212
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:44,970
know have hazards in the in the

213
00:09:42,810 --> 00:09:46,410
university so this is this is our

214
00:09:44,970 --> 00:09:49,829
favored example so what's going on here

215
00:09:46,410 --> 00:09:51,809
so we have a sensor and the sensor is

216
00:09:49,829 --> 00:09:53,969
sampling for instance the level of water

217
00:09:51,809 --> 00:09:56,309
and based on the level of water the PLC

218
00:09:53,970 --> 00:10:01,050
is taking decisions on how to control

219
00:09:56,309 --> 00:10:02,969
the inflow and outflow of water so when

220
00:10:01,050 --> 00:10:04,889
the tank reaches a certain level that is

221
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:06,899
critically high the end appeals you

222
00:10:04,889 --> 00:10:09,149
would say hey stop pumping water in

223
00:10:06,899 --> 00:10:11,250
let's just close the inflow and let's

224
00:10:09,149 --> 00:10:15,930
start pumping water out so we can take

225
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:19,350
the time to a safe level so this is how

226
00:10:15,930 --> 00:10:22,949
things should work so what about

227
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:27,300
security so what about attacks so let us

228
00:10:22,949 --> 00:10:31,378
zoom in for a second on the on how the

229
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:33,180
PLC gets access to the sensor date so in

230
00:10:31,379 --> 00:10:36,209
many plants like in Swat we have a

231
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:38,459
sensor that is actually mainly analog so

232
00:10:36,209 --> 00:10:41,369
there is some kind of cable that is

233
00:10:38,459 --> 00:10:43,378
connected to node let's call the lumo

234
00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:46,680
diode that is translating this analog

235
00:10:43,379 --> 00:10:48,480
signal into digital and then the digital

236
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:51,120
signal goes through the LC network to

237
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:53,100
the PLC and appeal' she forwards these

238
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:56,009
two other PLC's if they might need this

239
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:58,319
data right so what do I mean by a lack

240
00:10:56,009 --> 00:10:58,800
of authentication at those levels so if

241
00:10:58,319 --> 00:11:01,680
we

242
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:03,260
have an attacker that is playing ma'am

243
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:05,399
in the middle in any of these links

244
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:08,010
traditional classical IT man in the

245
00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:10,230
middle then there's nothing preventing

246
00:11:08,010 --> 00:11:14,399
this attacker to actually spoof or force

247
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:17,940
these values in many many ICS country

248
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:20,070
and is not super trivial to do so you

249
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:21,600
have to understand the low-level

250
00:11:20,070 --> 00:11:24,600
protocols these industrial protocols

251
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:26,339
they're not standard but I mean if you

252
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:28,649
want to do it from scratch take a while

253
00:11:26,339 --> 00:11:33,570
but essentially once once you're able to

254
00:11:28,649 --> 00:11:35,130
do it then you can do this and so I'm

255
00:11:33,570 --> 00:11:37,980
going to define an attractor model here

256
00:11:35,130 --> 00:11:40,380
that is both physical and cyber right so

257
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:42,480
we have your cyber physical system that

258
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:45,149
is inspired by many words in the

259
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:47,610
literature so we have seen papers your

260
00:11:45,149 --> 00:11:50,570
black hat the Afghan hacking the box and

261
00:11:47,610 --> 00:11:53,490
in the academic domain talking about

262
00:11:50,570 --> 00:11:56,070
attacks to sensors not only in ICS but

263
00:11:53,490 --> 00:11:58,380
also automotive you know drones and so

264
00:11:56,070 --> 00:12:01,560
on and essentially the physical attacker

265
00:11:58,380 --> 00:12:03,990
can replace sensors for instance he can

266
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:05,250
just bring his own sensor plugged in and

267
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:08,810
replace the other one because he

268
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:10,709
centuries somehow Manisha's wreaked and

269
00:12:08,810 --> 00:12:14,310
and and so on

270
00:12:10,709 --> 00:12:16,079
he can transcend swap cables from two

271
00:12:14,310 --> 00:12:18,300
sensors to ultrasonic sensors or two

272
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:21,120
random sensors to sabotage the plan he

273
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:24,719
can start injecting noise here or just

274
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:27,029
say false signals to the analog cable to

275
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:29,459
spoof attach and I mean this has been

276
00:12:27,029 --> 00:12:33,089
done this has been shown in black before

277
00:12:29,459 --> 00:12:35,939
how to physically spoof with sensor data

278
00:12:33,089 --> 00:12:38,399
but he can also under the hand be cyber

279
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:40,230
attacker on zero one networks from the

280
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:44,550
SCADA any kind of man in the middle

281
00:12:40,230 --> 00:12:49,260
attack he can try to observe learn they

282
00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:53,010
turn try to forge it okay so we open the

283
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:55,980
attacker model like this so what can an

284
00:12:53,010 --> 00:12:57,720
attacker do then then concretely so this

285
00:12:55,980 --> 00:13:00,870
is the first example of an attacker I'll

286
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:03,990
call it shameless is just remind our

287
00:13:00,870 --> 00:13:05,760
mind is shameless because we have a tank

288
00:13:03,990 --> 00:13:08,579
that had a certain level of water at

289
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:11,339
certain time stamp and then the attacker

290
00:13:08,579 --> 00:13:12,599
just breaks in and then claims that now

291
00:13:11,339 --> 00:13:14,389
water is suddenly

292
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:17,100
much higher than what it actually is

293
00:13:14,389 --> 00:13:19,680
right so because the trust model is that

294
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:21,269
the PLC will trust sensor data coming

295
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:23,489
from the zero net world one at war and

296
00:13:21,269 --> 00:13:25,649
so on it will then take the wrong

297
00:13:23,490 --> 00:13:27,060
control decision it will decide Oh what

298
00:13:25,649 --> 00:13:29,250
are you very high let me close the

299
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:32,310
inflow and open the upload and because

300
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:35,880
the real value it's very close to zero

301
00:13:32,310 --> 00:13:38,670
then you risk actually two to empty the

302
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:42,810
tank and then ruin the pump by pumping

303
00:13:38,670 --> 00:13:46,110
dry essentially so and I call the

304
00:13:42,810 --> 00:13:47,609
shingles because this abrupt jump if we

305
00:13:46,110 --> 00:13:48,870
just observe the previous value and any

306
00:13:47,610 --> 00:13:50,850
value we say okay this is physically

307
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:53,069
impossible Khong the plc is not

308
00:13:50,850 --> 00:13:54,839
realizing this but the pills is trusting

309
00:13:53,069 --> 00:14:00,269
the sense of value and the logic is very

310
00:13:54,839 --> 00:14:01,380
simple you should so by doing so the

311
00:14:00,269 --> 00:14:04,800
attackers creating like a virtual

312
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:06,930
reality for the control logic that so if

313
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:08,219
you can spoof many sensor values this is

314
00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:10,769
not the state of the plant this is

315
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:12,690
another state and then you force the

316
00:14:10,769 --> 00:14:18,509
control logic to make the wrong control

317
00:14:12,690 --> 00:14:21,750
decisions so let me show you I hope you

318
00:14:18,509 --> 00:14:22,889
can all see this video so I at the

319
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:25,439
beginning the water is at a certain

320
00:14:22,889 --> 00:14:30,300
level and now we are going to open the

321
00:14:25,439 --> 00:14:33,360
valve here and when the valve is open

322
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:35,758
then what we will start raising here but

323
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:37,740
we are doing a spoofing attack that

324
00:14:35,759 --> 00:14:39,600
shows I hope you can see that the level

325
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:42,630
here staying stable so the control logic

326
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:43,439
and the operator will see that water is

327
00:14:42,630 --> 00:14:45,079
not rising

328
00:14:43,439 --> 00:14:46,980
well actually water is rising

329
00:14:45,079 --> 00:14:48,810
considerably I mean this is this is a

330
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:51,389
slow process this is four times the

331
00:14:48,810 --> 00:14:54,149
actual speed because it's a big tank

332
00:14:51,389 --> 00:14:56,699
right but water will raise by about 10

333
00:14:54,149 --> 00:14:58,920
centimeters and here we're spoofing the

334
00:14:56,699 --> 00:15:00,449
value we'd close the valve we're still

335
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:02,910
spoofing the value so we're running

336
00:15:00,449 --> 00:15:05,519
unlimited attack in parallel constantly

337
00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:06,839
spoofing the values and at some point I

338
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:11,569
will stop the attack and you will see a

339
00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:14,550
sudden jump here from 628 millimeters to

340
00:15:11,569 --> 00:15:17,240
732 millimeters because I stopped the

341
00:15:14,550 --> 00:15:20,130
attack now I see the real value right I

342
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:22,290
can do this in many ways from l0 from a

343
00:15:20,130 --> 00:15:24,660
one from SCADA the plenty of ways but

344
00:15:22,290 --> 00:15:26,809
essentially they are all forging sensor

345
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:26,809
data

346
00:15:27,889 --> 00:15:36,139
so what about defenses so what do we do

347
00:15:32,670 --> 00:15:36,139
against that but do you think

348
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:43,290
cryptography anyone yeah no so

349
00:15:41,490 --> 00:15:45,120
so what natural thought like if you come

350
00:15:43,290 --> 00:15:47,610
from the IT world you know from security

351
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:50,519
like traditional security is like okay

352
00:15:47,610 --> 00:15:53,100
why don't you identikit these networks

353
00:15:50,519 --> 00:15:55,079
so that the attacker cannot simply do

354
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:57,079
this man in the middle attack right so

355
00:15:55,079 --> 00:16:00,000
there are couple of issues with this

356
00:15:57,079 --> 00:16:02,279
essentially some of which are historical

357
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:05,430
reasons why we don't do that well first

358
00:16:02,279 --> 00:16:07,170
of all the nodes in ICS are usually very

359
00:16:05,430 --> 00:16:10,109
computationally constrained devices

360
00:16:07,170 --> 00:16:12,300
there are embedded devices so it's hard

361
00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:14,279
to put expensive Krypton there because

362
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:15,660
the frequency of sampling of packets is

363
00:16:14,279 --> 00:16:18,389
very high so you don't want to create

364
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:21,149
cues and backlogs so you have to have

365
00:16:18,389 --> 00:16:23,639
fast processors but that's well that's

366
00:16:21,149 --> 00:16:24,630
one reason historically it's not so much

367
00:16:23,639 --> 00:16:27,870
of an issue right now with modern

368
00:16:24,630 --> 00:16:29,850
processors the interest rate particles

369
00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:33,360
do not support these authentication

370
00:16:29,850 --> 00:16:35,220
fields or these cryptographic primitives

371
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:37,290
by default so you have to hack around

372
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:38,730
that you have to do encapsulation where

373
00:16:37,290 --> 00:16:42,389
you have to add fields and things like

374
00:16:38,730 --> 00:16:44,579
that but I think more interestingly it

375
00:16:42,389 --> 00:16:48,060
doesn't challenge solve the problem so

376
00:16:44,579 --> 00:16:50,609
if you look at this picture again it's

377
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:53,699
hard to put cryptography on the analog

378
00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:56,880
signal right because this is not this is

379
00:16:53,699 --> 00:16:59,609
not a device that typically can handle

380
00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:03,079
cryptography you have to come up with a

381
00:16:59,610 --> 00:17:05,339
new kind of device so once you start

382
00:17:03,079 --> 00:17:07,049
authenticating packets in the digital

383
00:17:05,339 --> 00:17:10,319
realm you might already have force

384
00:17:07,049 --> 00:17:12,089
values here that will have on the other

385
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:14,938
hand you could have also attackers as I

386
00:17:12,089 --> 00:17:17,158
said before insiders supply chain

387
00:17:14,939 --> 00:17:20,880
attacks in secure updates that might

388
00:17:17,159 --> 00:17:24,329
steal this crypto graphic keys this is

389
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:25,679
possible and then if once you get hold

390
00:17:24,329 --> 00:17:31,139
on a cryptographic key you can start

391
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:34,169
signing forged a transaction so this is

392
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:37,470
challenging so in the cyber physical

393
00:17:34,169 --> 00:17:39,180
systems community more from the research

394
00:17:37,470 --> 00:17:42,360
perspective people has

395
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:43,860
have proposed say hey actually you're

396
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:47,610
controlling a physical process so you

397
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:49,080
know the laws of physics of that process

398
00:17:47,610 --> 00:17:51,840
so perhaps you can model that process

399
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:53,970
right and build a so-called model based

400
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:55,530
control measure where what you're going

401
00:17:53,970 --> 00:17:57,810
to do is to have a model that tells you

402
00:17:55,530 --> 00:17:59,370
an estimate or a prediction of the next

403
00:17:57,810 --> 00:18:01,710
value based on the value you have

404
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:04,770
observed in the past and you can compare

405
00:18:01,710 --> 00:18:07,110
against that and then decide whether

406
00:18:04,770 --> 00:18:09,120
that make sense or not right so for

407
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:11,669
instance if you recently observe this

408
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:14,340
very low value your model to tell you

409
00:18:11,670 --> 00:18:17,100
look I expect that given the current

410
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:19,230
values of the sensor the current state

411
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:22,139
of the actuators your water is going to

412
00:18:19,230 --> 00:18:25,440
rise by a little bit right in the next

413
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:27,870
few milliseconds so if you now see this

414
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:29,280
what I call the shameless attack then

415
00:18:27,870 --> 00:18:30,959
you can detect that and raise some alarm

416
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:33,030
because that doesn't make physical sense

417
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:34,920
right so this isn't it

418
00:18:33,030 --> 00:18:38,100
this is a nice idea to combine these two

419
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:39,630
things keep in mind that one challenge

420
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:42,300
for this is that you have to have a

421
00:18:39,630 --> 00:18:45,030
model of the process and these in water

422
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:47,159
is kind of okay I mean it's kind of easy

423
00:18:45,030 --> 00:18:48,690
because the system is very stable and

424
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:50,880
the process is very stable but let's say

425
00:18:48,690 --> 00:18:52,770
chemical processes chemical plants that

426
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:57,450
are very unstable is more challenging to

427
00:18:52,770 --> 00:19:00,540
have such a model now another challenge

428
00:18:57,450 --> 00:19:03,000
is that let's assume that the attacker

429
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:07,080
now wants to outsmart all those defense

430
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:08,670
he hires a master student now so the

431
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:11,970
this fresh college graduate he's going

432
00:19:08,670 --> 00:19:14,250
to try to outsmart our defense and so

433
00:19:11,970 --> 00:19:17,850
they realize that actually they can do

434
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:20,190
something bit better which is instead of

435
00:19:17,850 --> 00:19:23,219
jumping from this point to this point in

436
00:19:20,190 --> 00:19:25,440
one measurement why don't we just move

437
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:27,270
slowly slowly slowly so that we are

438
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:30,450
within the threshold of the prediction

439
00:19:27,270 --> 00:19:33,389
of this model and we in the end have a

440
00:19:30,450 --> 00:19:36,240
cumulative effect so the attacker here

441
00:19:33,390 --> 00:19:38,220
will start attacking here water level is

442
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:40,800
actually never changing in the real

443
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:42,840
physical state but the attacker is going

444
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:44,460
to move slowly slowly slowly and over

445
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:46,379
time these will have a cumulative effect

446
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:48,390
so this kind of attack is called

447
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:51,720
stealthy in the literature I didn't make

448
00:19:48,390 --> 00:19:52,780
this up and this can bypass model-based

449
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:57,280
controllers

450
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:59,770
okay so that's a challenge on the other

451
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:02,230
hand there is another proposal which is

452
00:19:59,770 --> 00:20:03,610
to use physical invariants so the idea

453
00:20:02,230 --> 00:20:05,350
here is you want to correlate

454
00:20:03,610 --> 00:20:07,449
measurements from these different

455
00:20:05,350 --> 00:20:09,969
sensors and see if there was a violation

456
00:20:07,450 --> 00:20:11,800
to some fundamental law of physics that

457
00:20:09,970 --> 00:20:14,740
shouldn't change so for instance if you

458
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:16,870
had pressure and sensor level so the

459
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:18,190
level of water there should be a

460
00:20:16,870 --> 00:20:20,169
correlation between the level on the

461
00:20:18,190 --> 00:20:22,030
pressure you are measuring on the bottom

462
00:20:20,170 --> 00:20:25,450
of the tank and if you see a violation

463
00:20:22,030 --> 00:20:28,149
of that then you you can race on all and

464
00:20:25,450 --> 00:20:30,130
you know it is hard to come up with an

465
00:20:28,150 --> 00:20:32,110
exhaustive list of such invariants so

466
00:20:30,130 --> 00:20:34,000
you might miss some because you have to

467
00:20:32,110 --> 00:20:35,590
do this by hand more or less and though

468
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,750
there are some attempts to to automatize

469
00:20:35,590 --> 00:20:41,560
this but the bottom line is you cannot

470
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:44,140
change the laws of physics like of

471
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:46,720
course unless you are ironing then you

472
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:50,410
can you know bend lots of physics but

473
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:52,660
always shouldn't be the case right so

474
00:20:50,410 --> 00:20:57,930
what about noise and here we come to the

475
00:20:52,660 --> 00:21:00,070
central point of the talk so essentially

476
00:20:57,930 --> 00:21:02,140
the question we are asking here is can

477
00:21:00,070 --> 00:21:05,409
we leverage some sensor noise in order

478
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:07,180
to fingerprint sensors and then

479
00:21:05,410 --> 00:21:09,940
complement some of these defenses that

480
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:13,690
we have talked about before but there is

481
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:15,670
a challenge here and that is a specific

482
00:21:13,690 --> 00:21:17,860
research question we had and that was

483
00:21:15,670 --> 00:21:21,340
can we distinguish between sensor types

484
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:22,750
sense or coming from sensor noise coming

485
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:26,050
from sensors of the deef of the same

486
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:27,640
type and brand so let me show you what

487
00:21:26,050 --> 00:21:29,139
kind of sensors do we have in Swat and

488
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:31,630
Wadi which is a nod test which we have

489
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:34,570
there so this these sensors are

490
00:21:31,630 --> 00:21:38,710
different types of transonic level flow

491
00:21:34,570 --> 00:21:39,730
pressure and so on what is special about

492
00:21:38,710 --> 00:21:43,990
these sensors I mean they're very

493
00:21:39,730 --> 00:21:46,150
accurate they're also quite expensive so

494
00:21:43,990 --> 00:21:47,500
this is a challenge if you want to do

495
00:21:46,150 --> 00:21:49,600
research because you would like to see

496
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:51,430
if your research generalize to many many

497
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:53,139
sensors and and then is challenge you

498
00:21:51,430 --> 00:21:54,580
cannot buy that many of those so

499
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:57,250
therefore we have bought a few of

500
00:21:54,580 --> 00:22:00,220
cheaper sensors so I'm holding one of

501
00:21:57,250 --> 00:22:01,630
these my hand right now so these these

502
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:01,980
are cheaper we can buy a lot of them and

503
00:22:01,630 --> 00:22:05,850
we

504
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:07,669
combined or tests between the transfer

505
00:22:05,850 --> 00:22:12,678
physically on the plant and our sensors

506
00:22:07,669 --> 00:22:15,809
that we bought to to do experiments okay

507
00:22:12,679 --> 00:22:17,039
so how does sensor noise look like for

508
00:22:15,809 --> 00:22:20,908
different sensors so here I'm showing

509
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:23,908
you different types of sensors and their

510
00:22:20,909 --> 00:22:28,620
noise do you think their noise patterns

511
00:22:23,909 --> 00:22:30,899
are different yes no yes well there are

512
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:32,939
different colors of course but yes

513
00:22:30,899 --> 00:22:36,739
also they look noticeably different I

514
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:39,330
hope and so this is just to show that

515
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:41,580
essentially they are measuring us the

516
00:22:39,330 --> 00:22:43,408
same path constant physical quantity and

517
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:46,350
what you see are oscillations due to

518
00:22:43,409 --> 00:22:49,080
their physical imperfections and many

519
00:22:46,350 --> 00:22:50,459
other reasons and it's not so hard to

520
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:53,428
see that if you take different sensor

521
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:55,260
types there are no nice patterns are

522
00:22:53,429 --> 00:22:57,480
different time so that's I said before

523
00:22:55,260 --> 00:22:59,010
the real challenge is to say if you take

524
00:22:57,480 --> 00:23:00,510
many sensors of the same type

525
00:22:59,010 --> 00:23:03,629
can you still distinguish them to create

526
00:23:00,510 --> 00:23:06,750
a fingerprint by the way we're not the

527
00:23:03,630 --> 00:23:08,730
first to explore this topic of sensor

528
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:10,289
fingerprinting there this has being

529
00:23:08,730 --> 00:23:12,899
explored in other domains like mobile

530
00:23:10,289 --> 00:23:16,490
sensors clocks microphones cameras but

531
00:23:12,899 --> 00:23:19,768
we are among the first to do this on ICS

532
00:23:16,490 --> 00:23:21,299
so what do I mean by the challenge is

533
00:23:19,769 --> 00:23:24,419
between distinguishing sensor noise of

534
00:23:21,299 --> 00:23:26,908
two sensors of the same type so now here

535
00:23:24,419 --> 00:23:29,330
you have measurements of two sensors

536
00:23:26,909 --> 00:23:33,360
there are two ultrasonic level sensors

537
00:23:29,330 --> 00:23:38,250
and one in red one in blue do you see

538
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:41,908
differences in their nose pattern maybe

539
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:43,049
I mean it's a bit trickier right so

540
00:23:41,909 --> 00:23:44,669
there are a couple of things we would

541
00:23:43,049 --> 00:23:46,379
like to have for a sensor for a

542
00:23:44,669 --> 00:23:47,610
fingerprint to make sense so one thing

543
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:49,110
is that the finger pitch should be

544
00:23:47,610 --> 00:23:51,360
stable like if you take your human

545
00:23:49,110 --> 00:23:54,029
fingerprint you want it to work one week

546
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:57,000
from now one year from now so we can run

547
00:23:54,029 --> 00:23:59,610
this place like one day and then the

548
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:02,610
week afterwards and see if the noise

549
00:23:59,610 --> 00:24:04,439
patterns are sort of stable and we can

550
00:24:02,610 --> 00:24:06,299
see that they tend to be stable I mean

551
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:09,029
like they seem more or less similar

552
00:24:06,299 --> 00:24:11,100
right so they didn't change too much so

553
00:24:09,029 --> 00:24:13,889
red versus red blue versus ooh there are

554
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:15,449
more or less okay but still is

555
00:24:13,889 --> 00:24:17,840
challenging to tell them apart

556
00:24:15,450 --> 00:24:20,279
red versus blue it's a big challenge so

557
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:21,480
again to sum up - we have water level

558
00:24:20,279 --> 00:24:23,580
that is not changing in these two

559
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:25,289
measurements it's constant and we have

560
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:27,029
stable behavior between the runs but

561
00:24:25,289 --> 00:24:32,399
it's hard to see visually the difference

562
00:24:27,029 --> 00:24:34,799
between the sensor patterns so we hire

563
00:24:32,399 --> 00:24:36,809
our obviously we throw a bunch of

564
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:38,190
mathematics at the problem and what we

565
00:24:36,809 --> 00:24:40,860
do is we want to compute some features

566
00:24:38,190 --> 00:24:43,320
of this noise so that perhaps we can

567
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:46,830
really see a difference between the the

568
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:50,070
sensor measurements so if we now plot a

569
00:24:46,830 --> 00:24:52,740
couple of those features in 3d space

570
00:24:50,070 --> 00:24:54,960
this is just for illustration purposes

571
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:56,549
we have more than three features you can

572
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:58,590
see that now if we take many many

573
00:24:56,549 --> 00:25:00,690
measurements of the red type and many

574
00:24:58,590 --> 00:25:02,970
measurements of the blue type we can now

575
00:25:00,690 --> 00:25:05,220
visually see a difference so they tend

576
00:25:02,970 --> 00:25:08,690
to occupy different regions in the 3d

577
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:12,149
space so these are two sensors two

578
00:25:08,690 --> 00:25:15,210
ultrasonic sensors in Swat now what

579
00:25:12,149 --> 00:25:18,870
happens if you take two flow sensors in

580
00:25:15,210 --> 00:25:20,760
Swat of the same type same brand so we

581
00:25:18,870 --> 00:25:22,139
see that actually again I mean this

582
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:23,850
thing is not perfect sometimes you know

583
00:25:22,139 --> 00:25:28,168
others are an outlier like here on the

584
00:25:23,850 --> 00:25:31,080
top or maybe here in the middle but you

585
00:25:28,169 --> 00:25:32,820
know you can visually now tell that

586
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:36,750
there's a difference between these

587
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:39,330
measurements so what happens if you take

588
00:25:36,750 --> 00:25:43,019
now ten sensors of the same type so now

589
00:25:39,330 --> 00:25:45,090
here on the right you see measurements

590
00:25:43,019 --> 00:25:46,799
many measurements of ten sensors and

591
00:25:45,090 --> 00:25:48,240
ultrasonic sensors these are the cheap

592
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:51,779
ones because you know we wanted to buy a

593
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:53,850
lot of them and we still see that we can

594
00:25:51,779 --> 00:25:56,850
have a hope at distinguishing the

595
00:25:53,850 --> 00:26:00,418
features so what we want to do here is

596
00:25:56,850 --> 00:26:01,860
to use you know standard machine

597
00:26:00,419 --> 00:26:04,200
learning techniques like supervised

598
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:05,519
learning to build some kind of

599
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:10,529
fingerprint checkers on an authenticity

600
00:26:05,519 --> 00:26:12,450
checker for the photo sensors so what do

601
00:26:10,529 --> 00:26:14,100
I mean by that so the question is can we

602
00:26:12,450 --> 00:26:16,019
distinguish the noise coming from a

603
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:18,899
given sensory and we build a fingerprint

604
00:26:16,019 --> 00:26:20,730
that distinguish it from other sensors

605
00:26:18,899 --> 00:26:23,459
sensors are hopefully from attackers as

606
00:26:20,730 --> 00:26:25,549
well explain what I mean by so if you

607
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:28,049
take the taste sensor one and you take

608
00:26:25,549 --> 00:26:28,980
many many measurements over time you can

609
00:26:28,049 --> 00:26:31,559
split them

610
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:33,450
these measurements into chunks of

611
00:26:31,559 --> 00:26:35,160
constant size let's say let's say and

612
00:26:33,450 --> 00:26:36,600
you need chance because you want to

613
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:37,919
measure these features that are

614
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:39,750
dependent on time you cannot measure

615
00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:42,780
this instantaneously you have you need

616
00:26:39,750 --> 00:26:45,150
to observe a little bit of noise and I

617
00:26:42,780 --> 00:26:47,549
will paint them let's say blue and for

618
00:26:45,150 --> 00:26:48,809
sensor to let's say yellow right so what

619
00:26:47,549 --> 00:26:52,520
I want to happen is I want to build a

620
00:26:48,809 --> 00:26:56,610
black box that if I give it a chunk of

621
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:58,918
the blue type that I can sort of compute

622
00:26:56,610 --> 00:27:01,350
this fingerprint match it against my

623
00:26:58,919 --> 00:27:03,120
training machine learning training black

624
00:27:01,350 --> 00:27:06,600
box and then say yes this is an

625
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:08,610
authentic blue sensor one fingerprint if

626
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:11,549
I - the sensor one fingerprint checker I

627
00:27:08,610 --> 00:27:14,070
pass a yellow chunk coming from another

628
00:27:11,549 --> 00:27:15,809
sensor I should tell no you're not this

629
00:27:14,070 --> 00:27:17,610
is not about fingerprint for sensor one

630
00:27:15,809 --> 00:27:20,520
right just like a like a human

631
00:27:17,610 --> 00:27:25,889
fingerprint chips are like an actual

632
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:28,770
hand finger pin checker so this is the

633
00:27:25,890 --> 00:27:31,250
behavior we expect and actually if an

634
00:27:28,770 --> 00:27:34,740
attacker that is unaware of our

635
00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:37,200
detection mechanism is forging a signal

636
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:39,090
without any noise right so remember the

637
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:40,710
video I show you before I was a constant

638
00:27:39,090 --> 00:27:43,168
value so this value could be just

639
00:27:40,710 --> 00:27:43,679
constant flat measurement because it's

640
00:27:43,169 --> 00:27:47,130
digital

641
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:49,830
perhaps cyberattack then I will see no

642
00:27:47,130 --> 00:27:52,650
noise and this should be why of its and

643
00:27:49,830 --> 00:27:59,909
this should be really fake value I don't

644
00:27:52,650 --> 00:28:02,130
want this one all right okay so so if I

645
00:27:59,910 --> 00:28:03,210
mean not sure I'm more familiar you are

646
00:28:02,130 --> 00:28:04,919
with machine learning techniques there

647
00:28:03,210 --> 00:28:08,250
are a couple of standard ways to measure

648
00:28:04,919 --> 00:28:10,380
if what you're doing makes sense and the

649
00:28:08,250 --> 00:28:12,480
standard way is to have at least a

650
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:15,660
training set so you take measurements of

651
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:17,580
virus sensors like many many sensors you

652
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:19,650
label them you know which sensor

653
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:22,530
measurements come from a given sensor

654
00:28:19,650 --> 00:28:25,440
let's say sensor one and then you train

655
00:28:22,530 --> 00:28:28,290
with a subset of these measurements and

656
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:29,790
then you test against another subset

657
00:28:28,290 --> 00:28:32,850
that you have never seen before and you

658
00:28:29,790 --> 00:28:35,879
count how many times your classification

659
00:28:32,850 --> 00:28:37,320
was correct right so you can call these

660
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:38,640
many things but this is essentially a

661
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:41,689
binary classifier so there are two

662
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:45,600
classes authentic sensor one and now

663
00:28:41,690 --> 00:28:47,160
and we did that and we found we played

664
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:49,290
with different chunk sizes and we found

665
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:51,720
that if you take chunks of about two

666
00:28:49,290 --> 00:28:54,060
minutes this tends to work best and in

667
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:57,710
our case two minutes means 120 samples

668
00:28:54,060 --> 00:29:00,179
right so depending on your frequency a

669
00:28:57,710 --> 00:29:03,450
sampling frequency this will might

670
00:29:00,180 --> 00:29:06,120
change so again remember that is easy to

671
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:08,400
distinguish two sensors right completely

672
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:10,979
from different types so there we get

673
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:12,660
100% accuracy but the tricky thing is to

674
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:17,910
distinguish between sensors of the same

675
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:19,920
type the same brand and in those we

676
00:29:17,910 --> 00:29:22,290
reach up to 99% accuracy in

677
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:24,150
authentication tests so we played with

678
00:29:22,290 --> 00:29:27,990
up with up to 60 sensors of the same

679
00:29:24,150 --> 00:29:30,540
time and this means you just give you an

680
00:29:27,990 --> 00:29:32,430
idea so there's one false classification

681
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:34,649
either false negative or false positive

682
00:29:32,430 --> 00:29:37,500
so either we yeah we miss let's fight

683
00:29:34,650 --> 00:29:39,000
one out of every hundred and if there

684
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:42,060
are trans ices of two minutes this means

685
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:43,650
one every three hours smaller less so we

686
00:29:42,060 --> 00:29:44,970
think this is this is practical so it's

687
00:29:43,650 --> 00:29:46,680
like your fingerprint checker your

688
00:29:44,970 --> 00:29:50,760
biometrics can you know it doesn't

689
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:54,000
always work sometimes yeah you get

690
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:55,500
misclassifications we also I mean we

691
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,270
have been doing this for a while so we

692
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:58,950
have fingerprints that date back for

693
00:29:57,270 --> 00:30:01,290
years and for one question you could ask

694
00:29:58,950 --> 00:30:03,750
is is this fingerprint stable over time

695
00:30:01,290 --> 00:30:06,330
so for instance if the sensor gets older

696
00:30:03,750 --> 00:30:08,820
will degrade its fingerprint and we

697
00:30:06,330 --> 00:30:11,280
realize no that the fingerprints that we

698
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:15,360
have for from four years years ago is

699
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:18,090
still valid to still work and we another

700
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:20,429
thing that you might think is is is

701
00:30:18,090 --> 00:30:22,709
temperature affecting for instance the

702
00:30:20,430 --> 00:30:24,810
the behavior of this fingerprint and we

703
00:30:22,710 --> 00:30:27,090
measure temperature in the lab which has

704
00:30:24,810 --> 00:30:30,510
a wide range from twenty to thirty five

705
00:30:27,090 --> 00:30:33,149
degrees depending on time of day how

706
00:30:30,510 --> 00:30:34,620
many people are in the room and and we

707
00:30:33,150 --> 00:30:38,910
see that this is still stable so we try

708
00:30:34,620 --> 00:30:41,820
to control for from anything but note

709
00:30:38,910 --> 00:30:44,910
that when I'm talking about here so far

710
00:30:41,820 --> 00:30:46,460
is noise of a measurement of a constant

711
00:30:44,910 --> 00:30:49,080
physical quantity

712
00:30:46,460 --> 00:30:51,390
however you know CPAs are control a

713
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:53,360
dynamic process so this is still this

714
00:30:51,390 --> 00:30:55,230
works under very controlled conditions

715
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:58,580
but the next

716
00:30:55,230 --> 00:31:01,740
we work in one general so let me just

717
00:30:58,580 --> 00:31:03,178
briefly sum up what we have here so we

718
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:06,330
can detect this shameless attack these

719
00:31:03,179 --> 00:31:09,659
abrupt changes by means of model based

720
00:31:06,330 --> 00:31:11,939
controllers alone we can detect these

721
00:31:09,659 --> 00:31:13,529
flat injections noise injections by

722
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:16,139
means of these fingerprints and we could

723
00:31:13,529 --> 00:31:18,419
think that even in a stealthy attack if

724
00:31:16,139 --> 00:31:22,139
the if the signal is very very flat that

725
00:31:18,419 --> 00:31:29,220
should be very suspicious we can detect

726
00:31:22,139 --> 00:31:32,850
malicious hardware and the next question

727
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:35,940
is what about an attacker that now hires

728
00:31:32,850 --> 00:31:38,639
a PhD student and so he wants to

729
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:39,870
outsmart our defenses and he wants to do

730
00:31:38,639 --> 00:31:40,769
something where he wants to serve the

731
00:31:39,870 --> 00:31:43,129
noise learn they're not noise

732
00:31:40,769 --> 00:31:50,210
distribution inject coherent noise

733
00:31:43,130 --> 00:31:52,950
advanced attacks so note that I said

734
00:31:50,210 --> 00:31:54,779
what we had so far work with static

735
00:31:52,950 --> 00:31:56,820
processes but in practice like if you

736
00:31:54,779 --> 00:31:58,919
would pour water into a class you will

737
00:31:56,820 --> 00:32:00,990
see that the water level is not racing

738
00:31:58,919 --> 00:32:04,529
like very flatly very monotonically but

739
00:32:00,990 --> 00:32:06,360
it oscillates so even if you had a

740
00:32:04,529 --> 00:32:09,419
perfect sensor you would see some noise

741
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:10,889
that is inherent to that process so I

742
00:32:09,419 --> 00:32:12,240
don't if you remember the video that the

743
00:32:10,889 --> 00:32:13,769
water was actually oscillating while

744
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:20,730
while filling up it was not going like

745
00:32:13,769 --> 00:32:23,610
this so essentially if we if we plot how

746
00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:26,429
water tank that was a recurrent level

747
00:32:23,610 --> 00:32:29,549
now traces until a certain high level

748
00:32:26,429 --> 00:32:31,980
and then goes out water flows out again

749
00:32:29,549 --> 00:32:33,809
if we zoom in we will see that there is

750
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:36,090
there is some noise there right in the

751
00:32:33,809 --> 00:32:39,899
signal and that noise is a combination

752
00:32:36,090 --> 00:32:42,720
of the process noise and the sensor

753
00:32:39,899 --> 00:32:44,100
noise so we have both like that we

754
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:46,769
cannot split them because we have both

755
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:48,600
at the same time but what we can do is

756
00:32:46,769 --> 00:32:50,820
if you have a good model of the system

757
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:52,590
we can compute the difference between

758
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:54,658
the observation and the prediction of

759
00:32:52,590 --> 00:32:56,668
our model and now we we have something

760
00:32:54,659 --> 00:32:59,399
that we call the residual there is noise

761
00:32:56,669 --> 00:33:01,320
that is oscillating around zero you see

762
00:32:59,399 --> 00:33:05,428
so this is independent of if you are

763
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:07,408
going up this slope here if you subtract

764
00:33:05,429 --> 00:33:08,750
the prediction from the observation you

765
00:33:07,409 --> 00:33:12,170
will stay if the prediction

766
00:33:08,750 --> 00:33:13,730
good news data runs here okay so this is

767
00:33:12,170 --> 00:33:15,650
this is a luxury we have hearing water

768
00:33:13,730 --> 00:33:21,050
because we know we have very good models

769
00:33:15,650 --> 00:33:22,610
of the process and we can do this so

770
00:33:21,050 --> 00:33:26,060
what happens if an attractor injects

771
00:33:22,610 --> 00:33:28,760
flat noise so let me point out a couple

772
00:33:26,060 --> 00:33:30,020
of things here in this picture so the

773
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:32,360
attacker starts here right so we had

774
00:33:30,020 --> 00:33:34,550
water was I don't know coming up and

775
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:37,969
then suddenly the attacker injects this

776
00:33:34,550 --> 00:33:40,040
flat scene so we see that for a while

777
00:33:37,970 --> 00:33:42,140
the prediction matches the observation

778
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:45,740
but still we get a very weird kind of

779
00:33:42,140 --> 00:33:49,220
noise at some point the control logic

780
00:33:45,740 --> 00:33:50,840
opens devolve the inflow so we expect

781
00:33:49,220 --> 00:33:52,790
the model expects that now water should

782
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:55,939
rise but it doesn't because the attacker

783
00:33:52,790 --> 00:33:58,520
is spoofing the signal so that's why we

784
00:33:55,940 --> 00:34:01,340
see this jump here and when the valve is

785
00:33:58,520 --> 00:34:02,840
closed then these stops and when the

786
00:34:01,340 --> 00:34:05,870
attack stops then we have a big jump

787
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:10,040
because we were forging the the level on

788
00:34:05,870 --> 00:34:13,489
the level was actually high so what

789
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:14,830
happens now if the attacker tries to do

790
00:34:13,489 --> 00:34:17,030
[Music]

791
00:34:14,830 --> 00:34:19,489
even more sophisticated attack so this

792
00:34:17,030 --> 00:34:20,810
this before I show you was just a flat

793
00:34:19,489 --> 00:34:24,229
injection we can detect that because

794
00:34:20,810 --> 00:34:26,149
it's flat but I promise you I wanted to

795
00:34:24,230 --> 00:34:28,879
tackle the problem of an attacker that

796
00:34:26,149 --> 00:34:30,649
wants to somehow preserve noise he's

797
00:34:28,879 --> 00:34:33,230
aware of what we're doing he's trying to

798
00:34:30,649 --> 00:34:36,259
do something more clever so this would

799
00:34:33,230 --> 00:34:38,449
be tricky but I hope you can follow with

800
00:34:36,260 --> 00:34:41,360
me so essentially the attack starts here

801
00:34:38,449 --> 00:34:43,668
so we had water coming down so the slope

802
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:45,470
was at a certain degree a certain angle

803
00:34:43,668 --> 00:34:47,480
and now the attacker was to do a

804
00:34:45,469 --> 00:34:51,408
stealthy attack starting at this point

805
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:53,270
that tries to portray to the control

806
00:34:51,409 --> 00:34:57,530
logic that actually water is coming down

807
00:34:53,270 --> 00:35:00,440
but slow slower than he actually is so

808
00:34:57,530 --> 00:35:01,790
the slope is different yes so this is

809
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:04,310
why this is an attack because if the

810
00:35:01,790 --> 00:35:06,230
attack stops then suddenly water will

811
00:35:04,310 --> 00:35:09,320
the measurement will jump to the actual

812
00:35:06,230 --> 00:35:11,720
value which was much lower so the actual

813
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:15,050
real slope the real water level was

814
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:17,330
closer to this green one but here the

815
00:35:15,050 --> 00:35:20,240
attacker is not injecting a flat line in

816
00:35:17,330 --> 00:35:21,859
the slope but he's adding values to the

817
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:23,868
measurement he's observing from the

818
00:35:21,859 --> 00:35:25,098
your plant so if you would come in and I

819
00:35:23,869 --> 00:35:26,809
will swing out in a moment

820
00:35:25,099 --> 00:35:28,609
you will see that the the slope of the

821
00:35:26,809 --> 00:35:30,859
attacker has actually not he's trying to

822
00:35:28,609 --> 00:35:35,328
preserve the original noise by rotating

823
00:35:30,859 --> 00:35:37,279
the degree of the measurement so he

824
00:35:35,329 --> 00:35:40,299
hopes that if we have a you know a

825
00:35:37,279 --> 00:35:43,489
fingerprint checker we will bypass that

826
00:35:40,299 --> 00:35:45,499
right and what will happen here

827
00:35:43,489 --> 00:35:48,230
magically is that because we're

828
00:35:45,499 --> 00:35:50,118
subtracting the observation with the

829
00:35:48,230 --> 00:35:51,470
prediction there are very interesting

830
00:35:50,119 --> 00:35:53,630
phenomena occurs here that is the

831
00:35:51,470 --> 00:35:57,049
prediction because it knows the model is

832
00:35:53,630 --> 00:35:58,670
expecting what to go faster down so when

833
00:35:57,049 --> 00:36:01,579
we compute this difference it will shift

834
00:35:58,670 --> 00:36:04,339
the noise of the attacker down in these

835
00:36:01,579 --> 00:36:07,069
varieties so perhaps this issue so the

836
00:36:04,339 --> 00:36:09,470
attacker the that stuff here ends here

837
00:36:07,069 --> 00:36:12,430
and then we see that this noise is is

838
00:36:09,470 --> 00:36:15,769
whipped so perhaps it's a bit easier to

839
00:36:12,430 --> 00:36:18,140
see this in while the attack is

840
00:36:15,769 --> 00:36:20,269
happening so here we have water flow

841
00:36:18,140 --> 00:36:22,788
coming out of the tank you know if you

842
00:36:20,269 --> 00:36:25,249
can read but this level of water is

843
00:36:22,789 --> 00:36:28,099
coming down slowly and we had an

844
00:36:25,249 --> 00:36:29,930
original slope that now the attacker is

845
00:36:28,099 --> 00:36:32,779
trying to change right so now the

846
00:36:29,930 --> 00:36:34,819
attacker is spoofing values changing the

847
00:36:32,779 --> 00:36:38,210
slope but notice that if you zoom in we

848
00:36:34,819 --> 00:36:40,369
see that the prediction also starts to

849
00:36:38,210 --> 00:36:41,930
drift apart from the observation because

850
00:36:40,369 --> 00:36:44,059
the prediction knows the model and the

851
00:36:41,930 --> 00:36:46,549
patient tries to correct the speed at

852
00:36:44,059 --> 00:36:48,019
which water is flowing down so at the

853
00:36:46,549 --> 00:36:49,849
same time we're creating the residual

854
00:36:48,019 --> 00:36:52,430
and we see that the noise of the

855
00:36:49,849 --> 00:36:54,739
attackers also being shifted because of

856
00:36:52,430 --> 00:36:58,819
the subtraction of the observation minus

857
00:36:54,739 --> 00:37:01,339
the prediction so this is again a luxury

858
00:36:58,819 --> 00:37:03,380
we have in water because the models are

859
00:37:01,339 --> 00:37:07,339
so good and the process is so stable

860
00:37:03,380 --> 00:37:09,589
that we can we can detect this kind of

861
00:37:07,339 --> 00:37:11,150
of attack so here you see the attacker

862
00:37:09,589 --> 00:37:14,569
was injecting actually something with

863
00:37:11,150 --> 00:37:17,920
noise this was not flat but we managed

864
00:37:14,569 --> 00:37:25,249
to detect it by computing the receiver

865
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:26,839
okay and again how do we evaluate this

866
00:37:25,249 --> 00:37:29,480
how do we know this works in practice or

867
00:37:26,839 --> 00:37:31,470
not the same change machine learning

868
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:34,770
evaluation trick

869
00:37:31,470 --> 00:37:37,290
we trained with data tests on data this

870
00:37:34,770 --> 00:37:39,300
time chunks are residuals right there

871
00:37:37,290 --> 00:37:44,400
are not the noise pure noise but the

872
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:48,030
residuals so we found again that a chunk

873
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:50,460
of about two minutes work best and we

874
00:37:48,030 --> 00:37:52,560
tested this and up to 18 processes and

875
00:37:50,460 --> 00:37:54,180
their sensors and SWAT and this time we

876
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:58,350
get a little bit of less security we get

877
00:37:54,180 --> 00:37:59,609
96 percent which means 4 out of 100 that

878
00:37:58,350 --> 00:38:01,080
means classified but we believe this

879
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:04,010
still practical because it's unlikely

880
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:08,400
that you get to miss classified samples

881
00:38:04,010 --> 00:38:10,650
so in a row sequentially so this is very

882
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:12,390
unlikely and regarding attacks we played

883
00:38:10,650 --> 00:38:14,400
around with many many attacker models we

884
00:38:12,390 --> 00:38:17,370
could come up and we think we're

885
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:19,580
detecting all of those but again if you

886
00:38:17,370 --> 00:38:26,850
have a good model of the physical system

887
00:38:19,580 --> 00:38:29,520
ok so what about the architecture so

888
00:38:26,850 --> 00:38:31,970
where do you place this black box so

889
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:34,710
this is really up to you but essentially

890
00:38:31,970 --> 00:38:37,350
it would be ideal that you can sample or

891
00:38:34,710 --> 00:38:40,080
mirror the traffic data from all 0 and

892
00:38:37,350 --> 00:38:43,140
a1 levels to send and the alarms to

893
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:44,549
SCADA but of course then you know you

894
00:38:43,140 --> 00:38:46,410
open a new kind of words which is you

895
00:38:44,550 --> 00:38:50,220
have to protect that box and yeah the

896
00:38:46,410 --> 00:38:52,740
fun continues but at least you know you

897
00:38:50,220 --> 00:38:55,230
can catch a lot of attackers are unaware

898
00:38:52,740 --> 00:38:56,850
of this technique or that you know if

899
00:38:55,230 --> 00:39:01,320
you properly protect it then you can

900
00:38:56,850 --> 00:39:06,710
have better security than before so to

901
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:09,030
sum up a little bit so we have shown

902
00:39:06,710 --> 00:39:11,010
well the the a little bit of the

903
00:39:09,030 --> 00:39:13,800
hypothesis that we can that a

904
00:39:11,010 --> 00:39:16,740
fingerprint of sensors exist for ICS

905
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:18,230
which I hope you're convinced now that

906
00:39:16,740 --> 00:39:22,859
I'll show you some evidence that this

907
00:39:18,230 --> 00:39:25,380
might work and to do that we have tried

908
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:28,170
up to ten sensor types and up to sixty

909
00:39:25,380 --> 00:39:30,030
different sensors bridge type and

910
00:39:28,170 --> 00:39:33,920
ideally we should have thousands so that

911
00:39:30,030 --> 00:39:35,610
we can better statistically claim our

912
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:38,220
hypotheses but you know as I said

913
00:39:35,610 --> 00:39:40,980
they're rather expensive the industrial

914
00:39:38,220 --> 00:39:43,709
ones we have shown how this fingerprint

915
00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:45,900
together with process

916
00:39:43,710 --> 00:39:48,810
you can help authenticating sensor

917
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:52,800
readings and we get an accuracy that we

918
00:39:48,810 --> 00:39:55,080
think is practical right again physical

919
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:56,430
fingerprints are also not perfect I mean

920
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:59,009
this is this is kind of a machine

921
00:39:56,430 --> 00:40:00,109
learning based technique is not going to

922
00:39:59,010 --> 00:40:02,790
be perfect

923
00:40:00,109 --> 00:40:05,580
on the other hand this is just the

924
00:40:02,790 --> 00:40:07,710
beginning in in a sense because now the

925
00:40:05,580 --> 00:40:11,910
attacker can so what about the attacker

926
00:40:07,710 --> 00:40:15,420
now - entire research institute and this

927
00:40:11,910 --> 00:40:18,960
apparently has happened according to

928
00:40:15,420 --> 00:40:21,839
some people so straight actors might

929
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:25,710
have hired research labs at inner cities

930
00:40:21,839 --> 00:40:28,950
to do strong attacks as possible so what

931
00:40:25,710 --> 00:40:30,240
what then right you might they might

932
00:40:28,950 --> 00:40:35,819
think things that we haven't thought of

933
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:38,669
and complex very complex attacks so so

934
00:40:35,820 --> 00:40:41,730
for instance we know that princes this

935
00:40:38,670 --> 00:40:43,859
was an attack against chemical processes

936
00:40:41,730 --> 00:40:46,859
we know that in those cases is hard to

937
00:40:43,859 --> 00:40:47,970
come up with good models and we if we

938
00:40:46,859 --> 00:40:50,098
don't have a good model we cannot

939
00:40:47,970 --> 00:40:52,649
compute the residual so it would be much

940
00:40:50,099 --> 00:40:56,099
more challenging to to check for

941
00:40:52,650 --> 00:40:58,290
fingerprints and and there are many more

942
00:40:56,099 --> 00:41:00,060
things right so you can think of very

943
00:40:58,290 --> 00:41:02,430
powerful attackers that can do replay

944
00:41:00,060 --> 00:41:05,190
attacks and that we are unaware of the

945
00:41:02,430 --> 00:41:09,000
other of the cyber level and so on so we

946
00:41:05,190 --> 00:41:10,800
have of course the you know discuss over

947
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:12,690
about these things is hard to come up

948
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:15,150
with all possible attacks in security

949
00:41:12,690 --> 00:41:17,220
right but we have some ideas on how you

950
00:41:15,150 --> 00:41:19,290
could detect some of more advanced

951
00:41:17,220 --> 00:41:20,910
attacks like for instance placing

952
00:41:19,290 --> 00:41:23,029
sensors in front of sensors and then

953
00:41:20,910 --> 00:41:26,730
doing challenge they respond attacks

954
00:41:23,030 --> 00:41:29,400
because under very control situations

955
00:41:26,730 --> 00:41:31,050
you know the expected reading of the

956
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:33,000
sensor there's not changing the noise

957
00:41:31,050 --> 00:41:34,470
there are some some interesting things

958
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:37,260
going on but I will leave this for

959
00:41:34,470 --> 00:41:37,649
future talk hopefully I'm running out of

960
00:41:37,260 --> 00:41:42,359
time

961
00:41:37,650 --> 00:41:46,650
and yeah so the knee to sea view three

962
00:41:42,359 --> 00:41:48,330
takeaways of this talk so first of all

963
00:41:46,650 --> 00:41:50,520
I'm not sure if everybody was really

964
00:41:48,330 --> 00:41:52,500
aware that in ICS critical

965
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:53,580
infrastructures oftentimes the field

966
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:56,330
networks

967
00:41:53,580 --> 00:42:00,569
not authenticated and this l0 l1 levels

968
00:41:56,330 --> 00:42:03,000
and the sensor noise can be useful to

969
00:42:00,570 --> 00:42:05,550
authenticate sensors without using

970
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:07,170
cryptography I'm not advocating against

971
00:42:05,550 --> 00:42:10,020
cryptography of course but we can

972
00:42:07,170 --> 00:42:11,310
complement cryptography with things that

973
00:42:10,020 --> 00:42:14,220
come from the physical and control

974
00:42:11,310 --> 00:42:16,710
theory domain and process plus sensor

975
00:42:14,220 --> 00:42:18,509
noise results in a more robust

976
00:42:16,710 --> 00:42:21,240
fingerprint right so if we consider a

977
00:42:18,510 --> 00:42:22,950
dynamic process and it's in here noise

978
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:24,810
we have something that is more robust

979
00:42:22,950 --> 00:42:28,859
than plain noise in control

980
00:42:24,810 --> 00:42:30,480
circumstances so with this I would like

981
00:42:28,860 --> 00:42:33,220
to thank you for your attention and for

982
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:37,800
coming to this talk

983
00:42:33,220 --> 00:42:37,799
[Applause]

984
00:42:39,150 --> 00:42:43,570
so we have a bit of time for questions

985
00:42:42,370 --> 00:42:56,440
so if you have to push okay you can come

986
00:42:43,570 --> 00:42:58,600
up to the mic so that or yeah sorry yes

987
00:42:56,440 --> 00:43:02,170
good afternoon thank you for the for the

988
00:42:58,600 --> 00:43:04,569
excellent talk in the ot and ICS space

989
00:43:02,170 --> 00:43:07,030
we often see organizations that want to

990
00:43:04,570 --> 00:43:09,850
have a complement between their security

991
00:43:07,030 --> 00:43:11,560
posture and operational efficiency they

992
00:43:09,850 --> 00:43:13,720
want to know how it makes them how can

993
00:43:11,560 --> 00:43:15,430
they make it up time more how can they

994
00:43:13,720 --> 00:43:18,819
produce better how can they lower costs

995
00:43:15,430 --> 00:43:22,060
have you done any investigation into

996
00:43:18,820 --> 00:43:25,260
predicting degradation of sensors

997
00:43:22,060 --> 00:43:28,270
maintenance cycles and or identifying

998
00:43:25,260 --> 00:43:30,580
service requirements like obstructed

999
00:43:28,270 --> 00:43:34,780
pipe by using the same data so I can

1000
00:43:30,580 --> 00:43:36,279
provide the the organization both hey I

1001
00:43:34,780 --> 00:43:38,320
have a security thing I can tell you

1002
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:41,620
that someone has replaced your sensor or

1003
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:43,660
hey I can tell you sensor a is actually

1004
00:43:41,620 --> 00:43:44,620
degrading or there's obstruction in this

1005
00:43:43,660 --> 00:43:49,540
pipe and you need to send a maintenance

1006
00:43:44,620 --> 00:43:50,620
person to go resolve it yeah so no not

1007
00:43:49,540 --> 00:43:52,810
exactly

1008
00:43:50,620 --> 00:43:54,069
we haven't done that thanks for the

1009
00:43:52,810 --> 00:43:55,720
question now you can you can discuss

1010
00:43:54,070 --> 00:43:57,190
also a little bit more offline about

1011
00:43:55,720 --> 00:43:58,959
things we have done we have looked a

1012
00:43:57,190 --> 00:44:01,420
little bit into degradation or service

1013
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:03,160
caused by cryptography for curiosity and

1014
00:44:01,420 --> 00:44:06,400
we have measured this extensively but

1015
00:44:03,160 --> 00:44:08,259
not not necessarily in this in sense

1016
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:10,000
that you asked but we can we can take

1017
00:44:08,260 --> 00:44:13,090
offline maybe butyou've has more things

1018
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:15,310
to say yeah I think you tell us about

1019
00:44:13,090 --> 00:44:17,350
the weather what's the physical element

1020
00:44:15,310 --> 00:44:19,890
that you're measuring I may I'm sorry if

1021
00:44:17,350 --> 00:44:22,690
I missed that at the beginning this is

1022
00:44:19,890 --> 00:44:25,120
what's generating the noise that you are

1023
00:44:22,690 --> 00:44:26,560
measured right so yeah it's a bit

1024
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:28,569
pressure so essentially like if you have

1025
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:30,370
a sensor like this this is ultrasonic

1026
00:44:28,570 --> 00:44:32,830
sensor so how it works is it sends a

1027
00:44:30,370 --> 00:44:35,109
sound signal that bounces to measure

1028
00:44:32,830 --> 00:44:36,190
distance right so you have water you're

1029
00:44:35,110 --> 00:44:39,880
measuring for instance the level of

1030
00:44:36,190 --> 00:44:42,550
water to send sound that bounces back

1031
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:44,440
but because of many reasons because of

1032
00:44:42,550 --> 00:44:46,420
the construction of the sensors physical

1033
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:48,070
conditions not every time that it's

1034
00:44:46,420 --> 00:44:50,650
distinct bounces back you will get this

1035
00:44:48,070 --> 00:44:51,850
exact same measurement right so this is

1036
00:44:50,650 --> 00:44:55,300
this is caused by the body

1037
00:44:51,850 --> 00:44:56,830
the ultrasonic properties of the signal

1038
00:44:55,300 --> 00:44:58,660
I'm not an expert on that site but

1039
00:44:56,830 --> 00:45:01,540
essentially this is a characteristic of

1040
00:44:58,660 --> 00:45:03,490
all sensors not only ultrasonic even

1041
00:45:01,540 --> 00:45:04,300
cameras like they will take like a

1042
00:45:03,490 --> 00:45:07,029
little bit differently

1043
00:45:04,300 --> 00:45:09,340
there will be they don't measure reality

1044
00:45:07,030 --> 00:45:10,450
perfectly but but but they have

1045
00:45:09,340 --> 00:45:12,940
imperfections every time you measure

1046
00:45:10,450 --> 00:45:16,390
though there's a small error that

1047
00:45:12,940 --> 00:45:22,270
changes a bit randomly so yeah that's my

1048
00:45:16,390 --> 00:45:23,950
I understand of it for the fingerprint

1049
00:45:22,270 --> 00:45:26,470
authentication were you doing a sliding

1050
00:45:23,950 --> 00:45:29,919
window of two minutes or just like every

1051
00:45:26,470 --> 00:45:33,029
two minutes you can verify the every

1052
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:41,920
time and it's a chunks of trim unit size

1053
00:45:33,030 --> 00:45:43,180
if yeah any other questions yeah your

1054
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:45,430
lab you're very controlled

1055
00:45:43,180 --> 00:45:47,169
you tried temperature variance to see if

1056
00:45:45,430 --> 00:45:48,279
the fingerprint changes and also what

1057
00:45:47,170 --> 00:45:51,810
happens when you fail over to your

1058
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:51,810
backup generator to the fingerprint

1059
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:56,470
variance based on temperature of the

1060
00:45:54,010 --> 00:45:57,790
sensor so if I dropped it by 20 degrees

1061
00:45:56,470 --> 00:46:00,009
Celsius I'm in an outdoor environment

1062
00:45:57,790 --> 00:46:02,710
does your fingerprint go bad

1063
00:46:00,010 --> 00:46:05,470
no I don't study right so what we did

1064
00:46:02,710 --> 00:46:07,750
was we kept track of the temperature to

1065
00:46:05,470 --> 00:46:09,850
see if the that will impact of the noise

1066
00:46:07,750 --> 00:46:12,660
right and we found out it didn't

1067
00:46:09,850 --> 00:46:15,370
although it changed between 20 and 35

1068
00:46:12,660 --> 00:46:17,170
Celsius because of different times of

1069
00:46:15,370 --> 00:46:20,650
day and the amount of people that were

1070
00:46:17,170 --> 00:46:23,200
in the room so but it didn't it was

1071
00:46:20,650 --> 00:46:24,400
stable stable yeah and what about like

1072
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:26,970
if you field over like a backup

1073
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:29,710
generator power source ah I see I got

1074
00:46:26,970 --> 00:46:37,930
I'm not sure if you control for that I

1075
00:46:29,710 --> 00:46:39,610
don't think we did yeah could you please

1076
00:46:37,930 --> 00:46:42,339
confirm that you're not doing a

1077
00:46:39,610 --> 00:46:44,470
frequency domain fingerprint - not to

1078
00:46:42,340 --> 00:46:48,700
the limited computational capability

1079
00:46:44,470 --> 00:46:51,100
that's on the devices you're not doing

1080
00:46:48,700 --> 00:46:52,600
FFTs or frequency domain analysis of the

1081
00:46:51,100 --> 00:46:54,339
fingerprint because of the limited

1082
00:46:52,600 --> 00:46:57,310
computation that's available on the

1083
00:46:54,340 --> 00:46:59,080
boxes no idea said I mean we can assume

1084
00:46:57,310 --> 00:47:01,750
that we have very powerful but books to

1085
00:46:59,080 --> 00:47:03,520
do the whole finger paintings what I

1086
00:47:01,750 --> 00:47:04,829
said was that you cannot building very

1087
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:06,479
easily cryptography inside

1088
00:47:04,829 --> 00:47:08,489
boxes but that's a different thing but

1089
00:47:06,479 --> 00:47:13,229
not for we can do expansive computations

1090
00:47:08,489 --> 00:47:18,180
on the on the on the on the signal so

1091
00:47:13,229 --> 00:47:20,759
that's fine what's the product you're

1092
00:47:18,180 --> 00:47:22,259
using to do the fingerprinting to

1093
00:47:20,759 --> 00:47:26,279
actually build the models that you

1094
00:47:22,259 --> 00:47:29,969
overlay your actual process variable on

1095
00:47:26,279 --> 00:47:31,499
the product what's the product that

1096
00:47:29,969 --> 00:47:34,349
you're actually building the models that

1097
00:47:31,499 --> 00:47:37,950
you overlay the actual process data on

1098
00:47:34,349 --> 00:47:39,779
to to to see the variants right so we

1099
00:47:37,950 --> 00:47:41,279
had a model of the system which is

1100
00:47:39,779 --> 00:47:44,279
mathematical model it's a linear

1101
00:47:41,279 --> 00:47:46,099
approximation of the differential

1102
00:47:44,279 --> 00:47:50,009
equation that characterizes that

1103
00:47:46,099 --> 00:47:53,519
physical process and on top of that we

1104
00:47:50,009 --> 00:47:55,680
compute the features and then we do you

1105
00:47:53,519 --> 00:47:57,328
support vector machines so with standard

1106
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:58,919
libraries for machine learning so it's

1107
00:47:57,329 --> 00:48:01,619
everything we build ourselves

1108
00:47:58,920 --> 00:48:03,509
essentially I'm not sure if that answer

1109
00:48:01,619 --> 00:48:06,869
question but okay so it's just something

1110
00:48:03,509 --> 00:48:12,239
you've built it it's definitely that can

1111
00:48:06,869 --> 00:48:14,699
run run live or what I showed the video

1112
00:48:12,239 --> 00:48:16,289
was actually a live construction of the

1113
00:48:14,699 --> 00:48:18,420
choux dough and you have a live detector

1114
00:48:16,289 --> 00:48:22,229
on top of that that is that is raising

1115
00:48:18,420 --> 00:48:24,420
alarms if necessary okay so it's no

1116
00:48:22,229 --> 00:48:26,788
product that's available to purchase oh

1117
00:48:24,420 --> 00:48:28,920
no no this is a cadet research so far

1118
00:48:26,789 --> 00:48:33,390
maybe in the future there will be a

1119
00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:35,249
product yeah okay no advance which

1120
00:48:33,390 --> 00:48:38,368
learning technique did you use for

1121
00:48:35,249 --> 00:48:40,709
building checker again which learning

1122
00:48:38,369 --> 00:48:42,029
technique did you use value you

1123
00:48:40,709 --> 00:48:47,519
mentioned the merchant learning

1124
00:48:42,029 --> 00:48:50,609
technique yes yeah we learn yeah support

1125
00:48:47,519 --> 00:48:53,038
vector machines okay thank you yeah

1126
00:48:50,609 --> 00:48:54,808
supervised on only only support vector

1127
00:48:53,039 --> 00:48:56,729
machine oh I think we play with no price

1128
00:48:54,809 --> 00:49:01,049
separate yeah and I think we try to a

1129
00:48:56,729 --> 00:49:02,879
couple but that that worked okay so yeah

1130
00:49:01,049 --> 00:49:04,349
but you could yeah you could play around

1131
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:13,109
that you already will get good accuracy

1132
00:49:04,349 --> 00:49:14,940
so yeah one more question with it how

1133
00:49:13,109 --> 00:49:17,970
did you physically collect the data

1134
00:49:14,940 --> 00:49:20,730
where were you physically attaching

1135
00:49:17,970 --> 00:49:23,009
to collect the day this noise data the

1136
00:49:20,730 --> 00:49:25,589
data that you're calculating noise that

1137
00:49:23,010 --> 00:49:27,630
from yeah so I believe that I mean in

1138
00:49:25,589 --> 00:49:29,970
our plant there's a historian that is

1139
00:49:27,630 --> 00:49:30,720
keeping so for our experiments we're

1140
00:49:29,970 --> 00:49:32,069
doing it like this

1141
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:33,868
so there's a historian that is keeping

1142
00:49:32,069 --> 00:49:35,279
all the values of them essential values

1143
00:49:33,869 --> 00:49:38,550
and you can record them for a long time

1144
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:40,680
and we are not analyzing that but of

1145
00:49:38,550 --> 00:49:43,440
course if you'd like to deploy this you

1146
00:49:40,680 --> 00:49:45,540
might want to have ad hoc like mirroring

1147
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:46,770
of the network because already they

1148
00:49:45,540 --> 00:49:50,310
store the historian if you're under

1149
00:49:46,770 --> 00:49:52,310
attack is easy to to fool so but we are

1150
00:49:50,310 --> 00:49:57,930
actually taking data from from there

1151
00:49:52,310 --> 00:50:00,630
yeah okay

1152
00:49:57,930 --> 00:50:04,229
