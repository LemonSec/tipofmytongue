without any further delay please welcome

19
00:00:46,829 --> 00:00:57,989
Greg Conti and Bob Benelli I good

20
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:59,309
morning thank you for coming we both

21
00:00:57,989 --> 00:01:06,330
really appreciate the opportunity to be

22
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:09,509
here this is my 23rd blackhat event over

23
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:14,850
19 years as an aside that's a lot of

24
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:16,530
backpacks but when I first came I never

25
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:20,479
anticipated that we'd be in a position

26
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:24,090
where we have to apply military combat

27
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:27,030
combat planning techniques and military

28
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:29,400
operational art to the security of

29
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:31,619
nations in cyberspace because of real

30
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:35,549
world offensive operations that are

31
00:01:31,619 --> 00:01:38,759
going on and a really critical need for

32
00:01:35,549 --> 00:01:40,619
defenses your robust collective defenses

33
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:43,200
where we work together but that's that's

34
00:01:40,619 --> 00:01:44,759
what we've done here today we've we've

35
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:47,939
tried to look at both the offensive side

36
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:50,390
and the defensive side to see where we

37
00:01:47,939 --> 00:01:56,008
are where we should go

38
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:58,250
so I'm Greg Conte my background involves

39
00:01:56,009 --> 00:02:00,659
be a career in the army currently I'm

40
00:01:58,250 --> 00:02:02,579
senior security strategist iron net

41
00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:04,469
cyber security prior to that I did a

42
00:02:02,579 --> 00:02:07,079
career in the Army in cyber operations

43
00:02:04,469 --> 00:02:09,000
teaching at West Point and in the

44
00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:11,420
signals intelligence world and this is

45
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,690
Bob Finnell II so I'm Bob Finnell a

46
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:15,600
computer

47
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:18,690
and security practitioner doing product

48
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:21,540
development with iron net and prior to

49
00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:23,340
joining iron net I was very privileged

50
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:25,410
to have a long and rewarding career as a

51
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:28,050
United States Army officer with the

52
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:31,290
final four or five years of that spent a

53
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:32,790
US Cyber Command addressing just the

54
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:35,670
types of issues we'll be presenting

55
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:37,650
today so really this is our mission

56
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:40,049
statement here this is what you know

57
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:43,680
well the problem we're trying to address

58
00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:45,780
how do we defend organizations but more

59
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:47,430
importantly how we bring those or as we

60
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:51,180
look at those organizations as sectors

61
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:52,800
and all those sectors and populations as

62
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:56,550
entire nations how do you actually

63
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:58,950
defend nations in cyberspace and we

64
00:02:56,550 --> 00:03:01,680
really like this quote by Jeff moss it's

65
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:04,049
from the introduction the introduction

66
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:06,330
before last year's keynote at blackhat

67
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:09,240
and it says it feels like our strategy

68
00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:11,490
our adversaries have strategies and we

69
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:13,740
have tactics that's not very good I

70
00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:16,020
don't like being in that situation I

71
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:18,209
don't like having no strategy so what

72
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:19,200
we're going to do and we agree and what

73
00:03:18,209 --> 00:03:21,690
we're going to do in this talk is

74
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:24,238
hopefully provide some thinking above

75
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:26,640
that brings that it merges the tactics

76
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:28,290
through the operational layer up to the

77
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:33,000
strategic layer as one cohesive whole

78
00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:35,640
for the community we have to warn you we

79
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:38,730
are going to use the c-word we're not

80
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:40,529
going to do so indiscriminately but it's

81
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:42,510
it's a nature so we'll be very you know

82
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:44,580
appropriate it's you know cyber pencils

83
00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:45,899
you know no cyber drones or anything

84
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:51,269
like that but we are going to have to

85
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:52,350
use it just to provide a little context

86
00:03:51,269 --> 00:03:56,660
about what we're going to be talking

87
00:03:52,350 --> 00:04:00,060
about we're looking at three levels of

88
00:03:56,660 --> 00:04:02,250
three levels of warfare right the

89
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:03,870
tactical operational and strategic level

90
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:06,090
and if you think about much of

91
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:09,570
information security is hands on

92
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:11,610
keyboard work small teams conducting you

93
00:04:09,570 --> 00:04:14,100
know small-scale and engagements like a

94
00:04:11,610 --> 00:04:15,720
Red Team engagement right and if you

95
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:18,560
look at the books most of the books

96
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:22,140
there are about hands on keyboard stuff

97
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:23,580
but at the level above that you and

98
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:25,080
we've used this in the past where you

99
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:26,430
start thinking well what are the

100
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:28,680
campaigns that are taking

101
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:31,110
place right how do these small teams

102
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:31,830
form campaigns and then at the highest

103
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:35,070
level

104
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:36,419
how do those form national strategies so

105
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:38,759
we're going to try to do is connect all

106
00:04:36,419 --> 00:04:41,130
three dots in this talk today and this

107
00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:43,169
is part of a larger research arc that

108
00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:44,610
we've been on that we've been kind of

109
00:04:43,169 --> 00:04:45,990
trying to contribute to the community

110
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:47,910
because we see that there's really a

111
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:51,360
need to bring it all together in one

112
00:04:47,910 --> 00:04:53,280
cohesive whole and this we're gonna

113
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:54,570
release the slides later today out on

114
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:56,880
Twitter and then black hat folks

115
00:04:54,570 --> 00:04:58,500
releasing too but we want to show you

116
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:00,360
this isn't just an independent talk this

117
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:02,250
is like a five year research effort and

118
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:03,539
this is kind of like a culminating point

119
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:05,400
and then we're going to try and take it

120
00:05:03,539 --> 00:05:08,940
even further but we've done things like

121
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:11,070
take various facets of the problem and

122
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:14,550
presented at blackhat shmoocon in other

123
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:17,969
places we did work on collective defense

124
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:19,650
at iron net my colleague Dave Raymond I

125
00:05:17,970 --> 00:05:21,410
put a book out on it you know kind of

126
00:05:19,650 --> 00:05:23,789
all looking exploring this general space

127
00:05:21,410 --> 00:05:25,050
we do training on it and get some

128
00:05:23,789 --> 00:05:28,440
awesome feedback from the participants

129
00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:31,770
every year and we but more recently we

130
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:33,180
and it's these talks have helped inform

131
00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:35,130
this talk we've been taking it to the

132
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:39,150
sector's right they had the other ice

133
00:05:35,130 --> 00:05:41,820
axe right we presented at the healthcare

134
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:43,679
I sac in the spring and got some amazing

135
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:45,659
feedback because you'll see the ice axe

136
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:47,780
play a role in the concept of collective

137
00:05:45,659 --> 00:05:52,349
defense and then later this month

138
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:57,900
presenting on a a variant at the energy

139
00:05:52,349 --> 00:05:59,370
second conference so I wanted to

140
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:01,919
introduce a military concept called

141
00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:06,030
defeating detail you can think of it as

142
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:09,240
divide and conquer it's how a military

143
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:13,580
force can focuses on one adversary at a

144
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:17,460
time it takes them down one by one and

145
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:19,320
we argue that's going on today that one

146
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:21,630
by one companies are being taken down

147
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:23,580
because they're not defending his team's

148
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:25,979
yes there are some initiatives and

149
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:30,150
efforts but we're we have a long way to

150
00:06:25,979 --> 00:06:32,659
go you don't fight wars independently

151
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:36,239
because you'll be defeated in detail I

152
00:06:32,659 --> 00:06:39,210
think this is a great example so I'm on

153
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:40,260
the left you have the 2004 US Olympic

154
00:06:39,210 --> 00:06:43,159
team so

155
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:48,060
the best players on the planet

156
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:51,420
apparently on Mount Olympus but they

157
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:57,030
lost Argentina because Argentina fielded

158
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:59,100
a better team and we when you think

159
00:06:57,030 --> 00:07:00,960
about where we stand today we don't

160
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:03,090
really have a team right so we have

161
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:04,409
individual companies of very enterprises

162
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:08,190
organizations of various degrees of

163
00:07:04,410 --> 00:07:10,860
strength our offense we don't it will

164
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:13,020
all be all those companies have no

165
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:16,320
offense because of the government has a

166
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:17,669
monopoly on the use of force and we're

167
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:19,469
going to be continued continue to be

168
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:20,460
defeated individually unless we do

169
00:07:19,470 --> 00:07:21,840
something and then we're trying to

170
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:23,609
provide a roadmap and a bit of a

171
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:25,770
maturity model to show you where perhaps

172
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:28,440
we can go because if you're going to

173
00:07:25,770 --> 00:07:30,330
fight you have to you know no military

174
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:32,430
unit would fight as individuals you need

175
00:07:30,330 --> 00:07:34,320
to fight as a team and that's the

176
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:40,140
essence of collective defence it's the

177
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:42,240
essence of NATO and because we need a

178
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:43,860
defense that's collective because we're

179
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:45,960
facing a collective offense

180
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:49,620
there are literally armies operating in

181
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:52,799
cyberspace and niche in a myriad of

182
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:55,590
actors that aren't that are enabled by

183
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:58,890
state state level forces through

184
00:07:55,590 --> 00:08:01,440
capabilities or just law enforcement top

185
00:07:58,890 --> 00:08:02,340
cover prevents them being held you know

186
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:05,010
held accountable

187
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:08,849
Jason Healy has a great taxonomy of like

188
00:08:05,010 --> 00:08:11,880
ten ten levels of state relationships

189
00:08:08,850 --> 00:08:14,520
but it's that combined force combined

190
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:17,090
combined you know power that we're

191
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:20,370
facing is individual organizations in

192
00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:22,890
this collective offense this is a I want

193
00:08:20,370 --> 00:08:24,750
to show the scale and scope right so if

194
00:08:22,890 --> 00:08:27,090
you think these these states begin and

195
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:29,720
we're thinking globally here right that

196
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:32,789
they they look at their desired outcome

197
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:35,340
the goals of their of their country

198
00:08:32,789 --> 00:08:37,620
right you know it China publishes its

199
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:39,900
its its plans the United States

200
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:42,299
publishes its national strategies and

201
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:44,819
then from that though they derive from

202
00:08:42,299 --> 00:08:46,949
the end state they derive what targets

203
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:49,710
and again think it's scale right this

204
00:08:46,950 --> 00:08:52,950
isn't Red Team this is army level stuff

205
00:08:49,710 --> 00:08:53,870
and then they build capabilities acquire

206
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:56,240
capabilities

207
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:58,970
the far outpace any individual company

208
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:01,220
could bring could put together they've

209
00:08:58,970 --> 00:09:03,560
assigned their forces and then they

210
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:05,750
connect missions right and as a

211
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:08,239
community we tend to focus just on this

212
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:10,490
piece of the pie the kill chain right or

213
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:11,570
a kill chain happens in the execution

214
00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:13,640
phase but there's this whole other

215
00:09:11,570 --> 00:09:18,440
larger wheel that we take into account

216
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:20,569
because that's collective offense so

217
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:23,750
that's what this talk focus is on today

218
00:09:20,570 --> 00:09:25,610
the the state that like a serious threat

219
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:27,320
actors and those that they are the

220
00:09:25,610 --> 00:09:29,600
serious State for actors and those that

221
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:30,980
they are enabling because we believe

222
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:36,440
like the stuff the community is doing

223
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:39,770
now the CIS top 20 the you know the the

224
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:42,050
various frameworks out there are

225
00:09:39,770 --> 00:09:44,030
handling the basic blocking tackling at

226
00:09:42,050 --> 00:09:45,650
the lower level threat actors but the

227
00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:46,900
state ones we need to do something

228
00:09:45,650 --> 00:09:49,040
different and though in the state

229
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:53,510
enabled three actors you really need

230
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:55,910
something different because not just

231
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:58,040
their cyber capabilities the teams that

232
00:09:55,910 --> 00:10:01,280
they are fielding they all that states

233
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:04,579
have levers of power that they can bring

234
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:06,020
to bear and will use in these the in

235
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:07,730
support of these operations and

236
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:09,199
achieving their national goals this is

237
00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:11,690
just an example I'm sure many of you've

238
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:14,320
heard of it the dime model diplomatic

239
00:10:11,690 --> 00:10:16,550
informational military law enforcement

240
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:19,250
economic levers of power they will

241
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:21,680
combine with their cyber operations in

242
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:23,390
their military operations to achieve

243
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:31,040
what they want and this is absolutely

244
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:32,900
going on today so Bob so let's talk

245
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:34,730
about some of the the kinds of

246
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:36,319
capabilities that state-level actors

247
00:10:34,730 --> 00:10:38,390
bring in and as we put this list

248
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:41,240
together I was thinking is this too much

249
00:10:38,390 --> 00:10:43,130
tinfoil hat sort of fear uncertainty and

250
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:45,230
doubt level stuff but was gratified to

251
00:10:43,130 --> 00:10:47,960
see that many of the things we're

252
00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:51,020
presenting are also featured in other

253
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:53,510
talks this week so we're not we're not

254
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:55,730
alone in our thinking one thing to

255
00:10:53,510 --> 00:10:59,120
consider here is undersea cables these

256
00:10:55,730 --> 00:11:01,490
often go unnoticed but they're essential

257
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:04,490
to international regional and global

258
00:11:01,490 --> 00:11:06,379
connectivity a single cable break can

259
00:11:04,490 --> 00:11:08,149
take weeks to repair

260
00:11:06,379 --> 00:11:13,189
a coordinated campaign of destruction

261
00:11:08,149 --> 00:11:15,649
could cause considerable damage and and

262
00:11:13,189 --> 00:11:19,389
lead to years of disrupted global

263
00:11:15,649 --> 00:11:22,009
connectivity so having an AV opens

264
00:11:19,389 --> 00:11:24,379
possibilities for denial of service

265
00:11:22,009 --> 00:11:26,600
beyond the wildest dreams of any botnet

266
00:11:24,379 --> 00:11:28,939
operator and I guess one way to think

267
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:31,429
about this is does your red team have a

268
00:11:28,939 --> 00:11:36,379
submarine don't give them any ideas yeah

269
00:11:31,429 --> 00:11:38,559
let's not give them any ideas so mobile

270
00:11:36,379 --> 00:11:41,720
and satellite communications as well as

271
00:11:38,559 --> 00:11:43,519
precision positioning services and even

272
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:45,410
some infrastructure control systems

273
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:48,169
depend on having a relatively clean

274
00:11:45,410 --> 00:11:50,719
electromagnetic spectrum many states

275
00:11:48,169 --> 00:11:53,209
though can affect the the spectrum on a

276
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:56,899
fairly large scale at least in localized

277
00:11:53,209 --> 00:11:58,789
areas and a few nations probably have

278
00:11:56,899 --> 00:12:00,889
the capability to directly destroy

279
00:11:58,789 --> 00:12:03,410
satellites many more have the

280
00:12:00,889 --> 00:12:06,139
opportunity or the possibility the

281
00:12:03,410 --> 00:12:07,759
technical wherewithal to jam their

282
00:12:06,139 --> 00:12:13,429
communication links or spoof their

283
00:12:07,759 --> 00:12:18,339
signals so how many of you here work for

284
00:12:13,429 --> 00:12:20,769
a national intelligence service nobody

285
00:12:18,339 --> 00:12:24,079
right okay

286
00:12:20,769 --> 00:12:26,869
states can use the int to collect and

287
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:30,169
process information to a breadth and

288
00:12:26,869 --> 00:12:33,049
depth well beyond most any non-state

289
00:12:30,169 --> 00:12:37,220
crew and that intelligence capability

290
00:12:33,049 --> 00:12:40,069
also often gives the ability to an

291
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:42,679
extensive ability to recruit and use

292
00:12:40,069 --> 00:12:49,269
agents that can constitute an extreme

293
00:12:42,679 --> 00:12:51,259
insider threat the the significance oops

294
00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:53,799
I'm a little bit ahead of myself here

295
00:12:51,259 --> 00:12:56,720
yes okay so let me move to the next one

296
00:12:53,799 --> 00:13:01,970
states can also apply outside controls

297
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:06,619
and sticks and carrots to create

298
00:13:01,970 --> 00:13:12,169
leverage on companies organizations and

299
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:15,889
individuals to entice to persuade and in

300
00:13:12,169 --> 00:13:19,339
some cases compel their cooperation the

301
00:13:15,889 --> 00:13:19,760
significance of room 641a is left as an

302
00:13:19,339 --> 00:13:25,880
exercise

303
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:28,100
for the audience members so operating or

304
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:30,500
just having sufficient leverage over a

305
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:32,810
national intelligence or a national

306
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:34,910
level telecom provider comes with a

307
00:13:32,810 --> 00:13:37,729
position on the global network high

308
00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:40,120
ground and some exclusive influence over

309
00:13:37,730 --> 00:13:43,820
the the network environment in general

310
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:47,480
global connectivity depends in large

311
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:50,060
part on the major players acting in good

312
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:53,180
faith and being cooperative however an

313
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:55,160
uncooperative entity can manipulate

314
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:57,199
manipulate the environment for its own

315
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:59,410
ends or possibly just break it for

316
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:59,410
everybody

317
00:14:01,450 --> 00:14:06,920
states can also exert influence over

318
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:08,959
hardware and software supply chains the

319
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:12,709
things that make up the foundations of

320
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:14,930
cyberspace the potential exists to embed

321
00:14:12,710 --> 00:14:18,850
kill switches backdoors and other

322
00:14:14,930 --> 00:14:21,890
features into those foundations

323
00:14:18,850 --> 00:14:24,110
providing an opportunity for a wide

324
00:14:21,890 --> 00:14:25,850
range of offensive effects and

325
00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:29,180
capabilities that would be difficult to

326
00:14:25,850 --> 00:14:31,250
mitigate note also though that the the

327
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:33,500
bloomberg report on super micro which

328
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:37,190
we've depicted here has largely been

329
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:39,560
refuted however it does point out the

330
00:14:37,190 --> 00:14:44,870
sort of anxiety exists over supply chain

331
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:47,869
integrity so a single attack could be a

332
00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:51,320
costly inconvenience states have the

333
00:14:47,870 --> 00:14:53,390
ability to conduct combined operations

334
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:56,360
where multiple well resourced

335
00:14:53,390 --> 00:14:58,520
capabilities spanning the dimed

336
00:14:56,360 --> 00:15:00,890
categories are coordinated and

337
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:07,819
synchronized to create effects on a

338
00:15:00,890 --> 00:15:10,580
national scale doctrinal templates or

339
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:12,860
more generally now known as threat

340
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:16,640
templates have long been used in

341
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:18,470
military planning processes an example

342
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:22,010
here the template on the Left depicts

343
00:15:18,470 --> 00:15:25,640
the doctrinal deployment for a Soviet

344
00:15:22,010 --> 00:15:28,250
motorized Rifle Division the templates

345
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:30,569
described the adversaries preferred way

346
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:32,160
to use their capabilities to

347
00:15:30,570 --> 00:15:35,370
form the functions needed to achieve

348
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:37,910
some objective in ideal conditions and

349
00:15:35,370 --> 00:15:41,670
then applying that template to a

350
00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:45,689
specific situation assists in developing

351
00:15:41,670 --> 00:15:51,689
estimates of the what where how and when

352
00:15:45,690 --> 00:15:54,780
for the adversaries operations so we've

353
00:15:51,690 --> 00:15:57,270
adopted this templating concept for an

354
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:59,280
idea of operational templates and we'll

355
00:15:57,270 --> 00:16:01,430
discuss some illustrative examples today

356
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:04,860
we have a set of offensive templates

357
00:16:01,430 --> 00:16:08,520
organized by the threat actor profiles

358
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:11,820
and the large-scale objectives a sort of

359
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:13,770
defensive templates that are tiered

360
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:16,530
based on the current and projected

361
00:16:13,770 --> 00:16:18,270
maturity of the defense and a hybrid

362
00:16:16,530 --> 00:16:23,699
example that combines defensive and

363
00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:27,090
offensive aspects so one intent here was

364
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:28,860
to develop a way to see the picture how

365
00:16:27,090 --> 00:16:32,580
these individual incidents and

366
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:34,620
operations to campaigns and how the

367
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:36,600
campaign's conformed part of a larger

368
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:38,970
national strategy so going beyond the

369
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:41,850
tactical level that most of our cards

370
00:16:38,970 --> 00:16:45,780
reporting deal with into operational arm

371
00:16:41,850 --> 00:16:47,700
and up to the the strategic level so

372
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:49,260
consider that the incident you are

373
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:51,780
dealing with which may be very painful

374
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:55,530
could be just a shaping patient in a

375
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:58,079
much larger campaign it's also possible

376
00:16:55,530 --> 00:17:00,750
to drill downward towards the tactical

377
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:02,340
level and this can help to tie in some

378
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:03,990
of the more familiar frameworks we've

379
00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:07,410
been working with into a larger picture

380
00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:10,620
an operation is often depicted in terms

381
00:17:07,410 --> 00:17:12,449
of a cyber kill chain and there are many

382
00:17:10,619 --> 00:17:15,119
variants to choose from out there but

383
00:17:12,449 --> 00:17:18,540
they all build on the original find fix

384
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:22,319
fight and finish concept from the dates

385
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:24,540
back to World War 2 going a bit further

386
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:27,389
we can even get down to level individual

387
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:29,190
tactics techniques and procedures for an

388
00:17:27,390 --> 00:17:32,220
operation and see how that fits into a

389
00:17:29,190 --> 00:17:34,260
kill chain into a larger operation mitre

390
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:41,040
attack matrix is one well-known example

391
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:44,520
for various tactics so this is a

392
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:46,860
potential to assess individual TT

393
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:49,620
up through kill chain operations and

394
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:51,449
into a much bigger picture hopefully

395
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:54,870
giving us a better way to see the trees

396
00:17:51,450 --> 00:17:56,040
and the forest hopping Bob - I just want

397
00:17:54,870 --> 00:17:58,620
to underscore this I think this is

398
00:17:56,040 --> 00:18:00,450
important that we can go from TTP's you

399
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:02,909
know a set of TTP's supporting a kill

400
00:18:00,450 --> 00:18:04,830
chain or kill chains and and then link

401
00:18:02,910 --> 00:18:06,570
all the way from TTP's up the national

402
00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:07,800
strategy this kind of completes the line

403
00:18:06,570 --> 00:18:12,149
or at least that's what we were going

404
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:13,980
yes so this is a legend for the

405
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:15,809
templates that will follow the offensive

406
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:19,020
templates it will follow we've defined

407
00:18:15,809 --> 00:18:21,000
three types of lines of effort so one

408
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:22,830
for informational operations one for

409
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:25,830
cyberspace operations and one for

410
00:18:22,830 --> 00:18:29,309
physical operations we're also going to

411
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:31,050
show major effects which are having

412
00:18:29,309 --> 00:18:33,389
significant impact things that would

413
00:18:31,050 --> 00:18:35,790
definitely get noticed and minor effects

414
00:18:33,390 --> 00:18:39,059
which may much be much more subtle and

415
00:18:35,790 --> 00:18:41,580
and stay under the radar we've also used

416
00:18:39,059 --> 00:18:45,240
some time dimension and divided this up

417
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:47,610
into three phases an initiating phase or

418
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:49,710
preparatory phase developmental

419
00:18:47,610 --> 00:18:53,178
operations and then a culminating phase

420
00:18:49,710 --> 00:18:55,770
which would achieve the final objectives

421
00:18:53,179 --> 00:18:58,590
one thing to note is the templates that

422
00:18:55,770 --> 00:19:00,570
we have today are somewhat restricted by

423
00:18:58,590 --> 00:19:04,409
the need to have legible projectable

424
00:19:00,570 --> 00:19:05,850
slides if we included all of the detail

425
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:07,320
that we would like on these templates

426
00:19:05,850 --> 00:19:10,889
we'd probably get something like the

427
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:12,750
typical DoD eye chart slide so please

428
00:19:10,890 --> 00:19:14,429
work with us okay like notes that you're

429
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:15,450
missing an arrow well if you wanted to

430
00:19:14,429 --> 00:19:18,210
look like that we would have been happy

431
00:19:15,450 --> 00:19:18,870
to comply but we try to convey that like

432
00:19:18,210 --> 00:19:21,210
the best

433
00:19:18,870 --> 00:19:24,870
you know the key insights does everybody

434
00:19:21,210 --> 00:19:27,330
have this okay so the first the first

435
00:19:24,870 --> 00:19:29,520
operational or offensive template is a

436
00:19:27,330 --> 00:19:31,620
critical infrastructure control strategy

437
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:34,080
hopefully a somewhat familiar case to

438
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:36,899
everybody the goal here is to get some

439
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:38,909
degree of control over your adversaries

440
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:41,340
critical infrastructure and use that to

441
00:19:38,910 --> 00:19:44,160
exert power this could be for the

442
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:46,770
purposes of deterrence or persuasion

443
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:49,559
maybe just to to create an economic

444
00:19:46,770 --> 00:19:53,010
advantage or it could be in a more

445
00:19:49,559 --> 00:19:56,129
extreme case used to create disruption

446
00:19:53,010 --> 00:19:57,110
or delays to augment or to provide you

447
00:19:56,130 --> 00:20:02,480
an advantage

448
00:19:57,110 --> 00:20:06,020
in an armed conflict situation so this

449
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:08,049
is the template it shows the lines of

450
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:10,809
effort organized by information

451
00:20:08,049 --> 00:20:13,790
cyberspace and physical categories

452
00:20:10,809 --> 00:20:16,670
note that the earlier efforts set the

453
00:20:13,790 --> 00:20:20,450
conditions for subsequent efforts as we

454
00:20:16,670 --> 00:20:23,150
go left to right the major effects are

455
00:20:20,450 --> 00:20:28,460
enabled by the earlier development and

456
00:20:23,150 --> 00:20:29,660
shaping operations and there's

457
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:32,330
synchronization between the

458
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:36,760
informational cyberspace and physical

459
00:20:32,330 --> 00:20:40,939
efforts are used to to enable and

460
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:42,830
multiply the effects of each a note that

461
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:44,540
the the line of effort may have a

462
00:20:42,830 --> 00:20:47,178
relatively low probability of success

463
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:49,610
and so we may define a branching effort

464
00:20:47,179 --> 00:20:51,679
that provides an alternate path to

465
00:20:49,610 --> 00:20:59,928
achieve the necessary objectives or the

466
00:20:51,679 --> 00:21:03,410
necessary outcomes and note that the the

467
00:20:59,929 --> 00:21:05,540
accessing corporate systems line of

468
00:21:03,410 --> 00:21:07,820
effort here is an opportunity to show a

469
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:09,889
bit of a drill down so I'm going to show

470
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:13,520
a little bit more detail here this is a

471
00:21:09,890 --> 00:21:15,980
view of a kill chain also with specific

472
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:18,410
TTP's mapped under the kill chain steps

473
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:19,910
this was done by John Lambert and I

474
00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:22,700
thought it was a really good example of

475
00:21:19,910 --> 00:21:24,650
showing how these TTP's and kill chain

476
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:31,900
steps could fit into a specific

477
00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:34,160
operation the second template is for

478
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:37,580
cyberspace denial strategy also

479
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:39,290
hopefully not a foreign concept this

480
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:41,750
would be creating a large-scale

481
00:21:39,290 --> 00:21:43,659
availability loss that hurts your

482
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:47,000
adversary more than it hurts you

483
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:50,419
this could be as transient as sort of a

484
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:53,360
dueling denial of service operations or

485
00:21:50,419 --> 00:21:59,510
it could be as long-term as physical

486
00:21:53,360 --> 00:22:02,209
destruction of networks and systems this

487
00:21:59,510 --> 00:22:04,570
template again shows the the preparation

488
00:22:02,210 --> 00:22:07,309
and development efforts to be in

489
00:22:04,570 --> 00:22:07,970
position to create major effects when

490
00:22:07,309 --> 00:22:10,730
needed

491
00:22:07,970 --> 00:22:14,360
so think about I do some DPG

492
00:22:10,730 --> 00:22:17,060
P operations to test out my capabilities

493
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:19,189
and but keep it low enough that nobody

494
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:23,000
really reacts to be in position

495
00:22:19,190 --> 00:22:24,380
eventually to use that capability in a

496
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:27,760
more major way if needed

497
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:29,930
similarly things like DNS hijacking

498
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:32,060
another thing to note here is that the

499
00:22:29,930 --> 00:22:35,750
cloud providers that we had down below

500
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:38,120
these providers take the security the

501
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:40,480
integrity and the robustness of their

502
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:44,389
services very seriously but they also

503
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:47,450
represent a really high payoff target

504
00:22:44,390 --> 00:22:49,940
set so think of this you know an insider

505
00:22:47,450 --> 00:22:52,880
inside of your your cloud provider could

506
00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:56,740
hurt you very badly if you've seen the

507
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:56,740
news recently what's in your wallet

508
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:04,310
influence operations and perception

509
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:06,560
management use cyberspace capabilities

510
00:23:04,310 --> 00:23:10,610
as intended rather than trying to break

511
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:13,280
them the approach here is to use the

512
00:23:10,610 --> 00:23:17,510
capabilities to deliver and shape

513
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:21,290
information to persuade dissuade deceive

514
00:23:17,510 --> 00:23:24,050
or influence the object is to get the

515
00:23:21,290 --> 00:23:26,629
adversary to willingly act or perhaps to

516
00:23:24,050 --> 00:23:29,120
refrain from acting in accordance with

517
00:23:26,630 --> 00:23:31,340
your interests you could think of this

518
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:34,070
as social engineering on a national

519
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:38,570
level but we'll leave them there or even

520
00:23:34,070 --> 00:23:40,639
global so this template differs from the

521
00:23:38,570 --> 00:23:41,929
the previous two a little bit by mixing

522
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:44,420
the different lines of effort types

523
00:23:41,930 --> 00:23:47,690
together the cyberspace and the physical

524
00:23:44,420 --> 00:23:50,270
lines of effort serve to develop the

525
00:23:47,690 --> 00:23:52,070
accesses and the positioning that would

526
00:23:50,270 --> 00:23:59,270
be needed for the subsequent information

527
00:23:52,070 --> 00:24:01,669
operations things like subvert impress

528
00:23:59,270 --> 00:24:05,080
would provide a vector to deliver much

529
00:24:01,670 --> 00:24:08,270
more convincing messages later on

530
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:12,189
similarly creating information sources

531
00:24:08,270 --> 00:24:14,810
provides a parallel means to distract

532
00:24:12,190 --> 00:24:17,380
pacify or to deliver your desired

533
00:24:14,810 --> 00:24:17,379
messages

534
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:24,408
and we previously showed the possibility

535
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:26,360
of breaking down cyberspace operation

536
00:24:24,409 --> 00:24:28,519
into a kill chain but we can do that

537
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:31,248
here as well well we need an equivalent

538
00:24:28,519 --> 00:24:34,850
for information operations and happily

539
00:24:31,249 --> 00:24:37,039
Bruce Schneier delivers Bruce wrote this

540
00:24:34,850 --> 00:24:40,158
article that was in law fair it's worth

541
00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:41,509
checking out that it really breaks down

542
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:43,009
some of the steps in a kill chain

543
00:24:41,509 --> 00:24:45,499
approach for some of these operations

544
00:24:43,009 --> 00:24:47,539
and also offers some suggestions or

545
00:24:45,499 --> 00:24:51,100
thoughts for ways to defeat or mitigate

546
00:24:47,539 --> 00:24:53,619
those attacks I'd also note that

547
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:56,689
yesterday Alex Klim burg did a

548
00:24:53,619 --> 00:24:58,490
presentation here that was very

549
00:24:56,690 --> 00:25:00,320
thought-provoking and went into much

550
00:24:58,490 --> 00:25:01,759
more depth in this area so it's worth

551
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:08,809
checking out if you have an interest in

552
00:25:01,759 --> 00:25:11,840
this so the fourth template is the long

553
00:25:08,809 --> 00:25:14,119
game this depicts having a strategy that

554
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:17,090
takes a very long-term approach to

555
00:25:14,119 --> 00:25:19,459
reaching the goals the intent is to

556
00:25:17,090 --> 00:25:21,439
achieve the objectives with the target

557
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:24,679
never really realizing there's even been

558
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:28,179
a fight a key aspect is using indirect

559
00:25:24,679 --> 00:25:31,429
approaches and deception and most of all

560
00:25:28,179 --> 00:25:41,299
avoiding efforts that would trigger a

561
00:25:31,429 --> 00:25:42,980
significant response got it so if you

562
00:25:41,299 --> 00:25:47,299
don't like the next slot that the next

563
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:49,039
two slides blame me so this is a model I

564
00:25:47,299 --> 00:25:51,799
want to introduce because honestly I

565
00:25:49,039 --> 00:25:54,529
think this death of a thousand cuts that

566
00:25:51,799 --> 00:25:56,029
we're facing is occurring today against

567
00:25:54,529 --> 00:25:58,840
the United States and it's very

568
00:25:56,029 --> 00:26:02,509
effective if you think of our

569
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:05,119
government's ability to respond that a

570
00:26:02,509 --> 00:26:09,169
tactical for for government leaders is

571
00:26:05,119 --> 00:26:11,269
the new cycle strategic response maybe

572
00:26:09,169 --> 00:26:13,279
the election cycle and if you can get

573
00:26:11,269 --> 00:26:15,980
beyond that time horizon you can be very

574
00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:19,789
effective so we put together something I

575
00:26:15,980 --> 00:26:22,159
call the the staircase of apathy it's if

576
00:26:19,789 --> 00:26:24,529
an adversary move slowly and takes a

577
00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:27,500
series of steps toward their goal the

578
00:26:24,529 --> 00:26:30,529
small steps aren't noticed or acted upon

579
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:31,520
in any organized way right or if it is

580
00:26:30,529 --> 00:26:33,920
it's very localized

581
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:36,800
or modestly localized but if you take

582
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:38,480
large steps that will be noticed so in

583
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:42,399
general you try and take small steps

584
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:44,750
unless value of taking a large step is

585
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:46,280
you know it's so high that it's worth

586
00:26:44,750 --> 00:26:49,190
the cost that you're going to have to

587
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:52,100
pay so looking at it graphically

588
00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:53,930
you've got progress over time and you

589
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:56,719
want to take a series of steps towards

590
00:26:53,930 --> 00:27:00,020
your goal and you want them to fall

591
00:26:56,720 --> 00:27:01,820
below the apathy threshold and the idea

592
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:03,350
is you know what does it take to get the

593
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:05,240
attention of your leaders in your

594
00:27:03,350 --> 00:27:08,389
organization what does it take to get

595
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:10,430
the attention of political leaders to

596
00:27:08,390 --> 00:27:11,420
change you know something important

597
00:27:10,430 --> 00:27:13,070
right what does it take to get the

598
00:27:11,420 --> 00:27:15,410
attention of the board so there's really

599
00:27:13,070 --> 00:27:17,179
multiple levels of this threshold if

600
00:27:15,410 --> 00:27:20,990
we're localised up to national or even

601
00:27:17,180 --> 00:27:22,640
global change and as you go like let's

602
00:27:20,990 --> 00:27:27,650
take a look at something might cross it

603
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:29,150
the OPM hack right pretty you would

604
00:27:27,650 --> 00:27:31,160
think that's a high payoff target you

605
00:27:29,150 --> 00:27:33,170
get a database of everyone's secured 100

606
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:34,910
page dossiers on every one United States

607
00:27:33,170 --> 00:27:36,740
with the security clearance that's

608
00:27:34,910 --> 00:27:40,270
probably worth crossing the threshold

609
00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:42,020
because it's a significant value or

610
00:27:40,270 --> 00:27:43,940
influencing the u.s. presidential

611
00:27:42,020 --> 00:27:45,530
elections that's another one even bigger

612
00:27:43,940 --> 00:27:47,060
right but if you look at the open and I

613
00:27:45,530 --> 00:27:48,649
know these are attributed to different

614
00:27:47,060 --> 00:27:50,149
threat actors that's okay

615
00:27:48,650 --> 00:27:52,790
I just put them in you know we put them

616
00:27:50,150 --> 00:27:55,820
in as illustrated examples but the OPM

617
00:27:52,790 --> 00:27:58,159
hack got people's attention but for a

618
00:27:55,820 --> 00:28:00,409
limited period of time all right we're

619
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:02,150
the presidential election influence got

620
00:28:00,410 --> 00:28:08,200
politicians attention because it was

621
00:28:02,150 --> 00:28:08,200
personal and that's still ongoing okay

622
00:28:11,770 --> 00:28:16,790
so this is the template for the long

623
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:20,840
game this depicts using multiple

624
00:28:16,790 --> 00:28:23,270
parallel stealthy or non attributable

625
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:25,850
efforts that are designed by the final

626
00:28:23,270 --> 00:28:28,670
stage to achieve a significant advantage

627
00:28:25,850 --> 00:28:32,419
in one or more aspects of national power

628
00:28:28,670 --> 00:28:34,610
those dime levers of power note the

629
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:36,560
extended length of the first two phases

630
00:28:34,610 --> 00:28:39,679
here these would probably be on the

631
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:43,639
order of years if not decades is truly a

632
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:45,270
long game the strategy also includes

633
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:48,600
long term development of

634
00:28:45,270 --> 00:28:51,330
access to enable and augment the

635
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:53,969
cyberspace efforts think about this

636
00:28:51,330 --> 00:28:56,250
getting your adversary to adopt your

637
00:28:53,970 --> 00:28:58,620
technology would certainly provide an

638
00:28:56,250 --> 00:29:02,610
advantage for these other efforts

639
00:28:58,620 --> 00:29:06,290
similarly getting people you control in

640
00:29:02,610 --> 00:29:09,449
the right places could be devastating

641
00:29:06,290 --> 00:29:12,300
some may be inserted in in long term

642
00:29:09,450 --> 00:29:14,310
career paths others may be recruited

643
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:17,460
compromised or controls and very

644
00:29:14,310 --> 00:29:19,500
controlled in various ways you could

645
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:22,190
gain useful personal information from

646
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:25,380
this by doing things like hacking OPM or

647
00:29:22,190 --> 00:29:32,970
hacking Ashley Madison or perhaps just

648
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:35,430
buying Grindr the hybrid template

649
00:29:32,970 --> 00:29:37,500
depicts a defend forward strategy this

650
00:29:35,430 --> 00:29:39,420
involves augmenting the defense with

651
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:41,610
offensive operations

652
00:29:39,420 --> 00:29:43,830
this may include reconnaissance and

653
00:29:41,610 --> 00:29:47,389
discovery of attack our attacker

654
00:29:43,830 --> 00:29:49,770
capabilities action to disrupt an attack

655
00:29:47,390 --> 00:29:53,070
possibly preemption of attacks before

656
00:29:49,770 --> 00:29:55,670
they occur one feature of a kill chain

657
00:29:53,070 --> 00:29:58,409
model is the idea of identifying

658
00:29:55,670 --> 00:30:01,650
opportunities to break the chain to

659
00:29:58,410 --> 00:30:03,930
defeat attacks note also that in this

660
00:30:01,650 --> 00:30:04,890
larger cycle that encompasses the kill

661
00:30:03,930 --> 00:30:08,700
chain that there are additional

662
00:30:04,890 --> 00:30:14,370
opportunities to deter prevent or to

663
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:16,260
defeat the attacks so this template

664
00:30:14,370 --> 00:30:19,889
aligns with the dimed instruments of

665
00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:22,760
power any of those may be have may

666
00:30:19,890 --> 00:30:25,520
provide a means for mitigating an attack

667
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:28,590
note that this is not a call for

668
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:31,590
depending on hack back or some sort of

669
00:30:28,590 --> 00:30:33,840
pre-emptive first strike capability as

670
00:30:31,590 --> 00:30:37,199
an alternative to doing the hard work of

671
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:41,659
cyberspace defense the best defense in

672
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:41,660
cyberspace is still a good defense

673
00:30:42,380 --> 00:30:48,110
efforts in the preparatory phase to do

674
00:30:45,030 --> 00:30:52,740
things like build defensible networks

675
00:30:48,110 --> 00:30:55,889
create resilient systems set up threat

676
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:58,140
monitoring and to establish collective

677
00:30:55,890 --> 00:30:58,440
defense capabilities are still going to

678
00:30:58,140 --> 00:31:00,769
be

679
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:04,860
most critical aspects of success here

680
00:31:00,769 --> 00:31:08,370
the offensive efforts are also unlikely

681
00:31:04,860 --> 00:31:12,029
to permanently defeat an attacker they

682
00:31:08,370 --> 00:31:13,350
usually live to fight another day so

683
00:31:12,029 --> 00:31:15,899
it's more productive to think of them in

684
00:31:13,350 --> 00:31:18,928
terms of providing an interdiction

685
00:31:15,899 --> 00:31:21,330
effect that prevents adversaries from

686
00:31:18,929 --> 00:31:25,129
using their offensive capabilities at

687
00:31:21,330 --> 00:31:25,129
the time and place of their choosing

688
00:31:26,549 --> 00:31:31,950
defending forward can help by disrupting

689
00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:34,440
delaying or diverting the adversaries

690
00:31:31,950 --> 00:31:36,299
capabilities and it's also possible that

691
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:38,129
these offensive effects may have a

692
00:31:36,299 --> 00:31:41,158
deterrent effect on the adversary to

693
00:31:38,129 --> 00:31:43,740
continue what they're doing in the

694
00:31:41,159 --> 00:31:45,629
culminating stage the effects across all

695
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:47,580
of the elements of power can be brought

696
00:31:45,629 --> 00:31:50,789
to bear to augment the cyberspace

697
00:31:47,580 --> 00:31:52,139
responses in an extreme case this could

698
00:31:50,789 --> 00:31:56,279
even include things like kinetic

699
00:31:52,139 --> 00:31:58,590
operations one interesting thing is you

700
00:31:56,279 --> 00:32:01,950
may ask yourself what's the most

701
00:31:58,590 --> 00:32:04,110
powerful offensive capability you've

702
00:32:01,950 --> 00:32:06,240
ever used in a cyber space exercise a

703
00:32:04,110 --> 00:32:08,899
CTF a force on force

704
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:12,899
you know Metasploit power shell empire

705
00:32:08,899 --> 00:32:16,049
MSO eight oh six seven I've had the

706
00:32:12,899 --> 00:32:19,049
opportunity to use a b-52 dropping live

707
00:32:16,049 --> 00:32:31,139
bomb scene exercise on a range yes on a

708
00:32:19,049 --> 00:32:32,279
range yes great okay and just backing up

709
00:32:31,139 --> 00:32:35,100
for a second I want to emphasize that

710
00:32:32,279 --> 00:32:37,080
what we've created here are general

711
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:38,879
strategic templates right and a way to

712
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:41,699
think about the problem like obviously

713
00:32:38,879 --> 00:32:43,289
arrows if you use this technique you'll

714
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:45,929
have arrows and other places but we're

715
00:32:43,289 --> 00:32:47,039
trying to provide like a illustrations

716
00:32:45,929 --> 00:32:50,549
of how this could be done in these

717
00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:52,620
general strategic categories so on the

718
00:32:50,549 --> 00:32:54,330
defensive side we took a little bit

719
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:56,158
different approach right as you see from

720
00:32:54,330 --> 00:32:59,250
on the offensive side we kind of reverse

721
00:32:56,159 --> 00:33:00,419
engineered what's going on now and I and

722
00:32:59,250 --> 00:33:01,860
we think that there could be you know

723
00:33:00,419 --> 00:33:03,870
multiple ones more we're not saying

724
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:06,719
that's the entire set but on the

725
00:33:03,870 --> 00:33:08,969
defensive side we tied to look at you

726
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:11,500
know how do we defend you know where are

727
00:33:08,970 --> 00:33:14,020
we now and where do we want to go

728
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:16,210
right like it we took it so it shows

729
00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:19,059
that this temple idea can be applied in

730
00:33:16,210 --> 00:33:24,010
different ways and we used a different

731
00:33:19,059 --> 00:33:26,230
scheme here too like this is the legend

732
00:33:24,010 --> 00:33:28,780
right Howie what graphic design

733
00:33:26,230 --> 00:33:32,830
techniques we use you're gonna see boxes

734
00:33:28,780 --> 00:33:35,799
those are companies agencies enterprises

735
00:33:32,830 --> 00:33:38,408
right so we read green I'm sorry red

736
00:33:35,799 --> 00:33:41,650
amber green for weak moderate strong

737
00:33:38,409 --> 00:33:43,870
arrows represent information sharing and

738
00:33:41,650 --> 00:33:46,510
interoperability and then groups working

739
00:33:43,870 --> 00:33:50,020
together for a collective defense model

740
00:33:46,510 --> 00:33:54,039
have great for week and then stronger

741
00:33:50,020 --> 00:33:57,820
orange and then green so I'm not going

742
00:33:54,039 --> 00:34:00,100
to we wanted to create an artifact that

743
00:33:57,820 --> 00:34:01,870
be useful after the talk right so I'm

744
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:03,100
not going to thank you I've been through

745
00:34:01,870 --> 00:34:05,199
enough briefings where people have gone

746
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:06,610
through every single bullet I just want

747
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:08,679
to highlight a couple and you know I

748
00:34:06,610 --> 00:34:11,080
think you'll get the idea at the basic

749
00:34:08,679 --> 00:34:13,540
level organizations are operating as

750
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:16,480
individual Islands they're working

751
00:34:13,540 --> 00:34:18,759
toward the CIS top 20 controls kind of

752
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:20,379
the basic blocking and tackling and if

753
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:21,849
you're and this is what it would look

754
00:34:20,379 --> 00:34:23,618
like so we have the government on the

755
00:34:21,849 --> 00:34:25,780
left private sector on the right

756
00:34:23,619 --> 00:34:33,010
government's trying to protect itself

757
00:34:25,780 --> 00:34:35,710
and a lot of red right and if you were

758
00:34:33,010 --> 00:34:38,770
attacked by a state actor at that point

759
00:34:35,710 --> 00:34:40,300
it's a bad day right it may be the first

760
00:34:38,770 --> 00:34:42,369
time you've ever interacted with their

761
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:44,109
government and asked for help there may

762
00:34:42,369 --> 00:34:45,849
be people running and if you've read

763
00:34:44,109 --> 00:34:47,619
stories about not petia this has

764
00:34:45,849 --> 00:34:50,889
happened people running down the halls

765
00:34:47,619 --> 00:34:53,589
unplugging computers general chaos work

766
00:34:50,889 --> 00:34:57,040
stops weeks to months to recover

767
00:34:53,589 --> 00:34:59,020
critical shortage of experts in Active

768
00:34:57,040 --> 00:35:00,880
Directory to help think they're on a

769
00:34:59,020 --> 00:35:04,810
national level to help recover all of

770
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:06,310
those things take place at the evolving

771
00:35:04,810 --> 00:35:07,900
level things are a little better we

772
00:35:06,310 --> 00:35:10,359
remember we have five so this is step

773
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:11,710
two that you know the government is

774
00:35:10,359 --> 00:35:15,130
getting its act together it has some

775
00:35:11,710 --> 00:35:17,500
limited ability to offer a or organize

776
00:35:15,130 --> 00:35:22,990
government response organizations have

777
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:24,849
the top-20 controls in place so what I'm

778
00:35:22,990 --> 00:35:26,390
doing just to show the changes right so

779
00:35:24,849 --> 00:35:30,000
this is

780
00:35:26,390 --> 00:35:32,970
going to to write so you see you know

781
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:35,790
some changes the Reds turn to amber

782
00:35:32,970 --> 00:35:38,339
amber turns to green a little bit better

783
00:35:35,790 --> 00:35:39,930
information sharing occurring right now

784
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:43,430
actually you see information sharing

785
00:35:39,930 --> 00:35:47,160
your kering a little bit between the two

786
00:35:43,430 --> 00:35:49,140
now level 3 systemic well if people are

787
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:52,529
joining ice axe they might have an

788
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:54,180
internal sock they have improved sensor

789
00:35:52,530 --> 00:35:56,600
coverage to be at least know what's

790
00:35:54,180 --> 00:35:59,700
going on in their network they have

791
00:35:56,600 --> 00:36:01,140
threatened telogen steam right so

792
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:03,720
remember this this is kind of like a

793
00:36:01,140 --> 00:36:06,450
model where we are you know where we

794
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:12,529
started from and where we want to go so

795
00:36:06,450 --> 00:36:15,750
this is in the middle so from 2 now to 3

796
00:36:12,530 --> 00:36:17,750
again we're seeing things changing you

797
00:36:15,750 --> 00:36:19,800
know Amber's to greens more and

798
00:36:17,750 --> 00:36:22,800
increased information sharing

799
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:24,750
I didn't festoon this with arrows all

800
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:25,140
over it right otherwise it would look

801
00:36:24,750 --> 00:36:28,770
like that

802
00:36:25,140 --> 00:36:30,060
I charge that Bob said yeah but I think

803
00:36:28,770 --> 00:36:32,670
what's interesting to hear is we have a

804
00:36:30,060 --> 00:36:34,080
pop up the show that are organized

805
00:36:32,670 --> 00:36:35,850
around the eye sack you're now starting

806
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:41,400
to see people work together and share

807
00:36:35,850 --> 00:36:45,060
information at this advant at at level 4

808
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:46,650
advanced level you see that the and this

809
00:36:45,060 --> 00:36:48,540
is kind of moving into the future like

810
00:36:46,650 --> 00:36:50,280
we could argue that there are groups

811
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:53,640
that let you know at levels one two and

812
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:57,120
three four you know we're kind of on the

813
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:59,430
maybe heading toward that hopefully that

814
00:36:57,120 --> 00:37:01,380
you can get sector level situational

815
00:36:59,430 --> 00:37:04,169
awareness of like what's going on right

816
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:06,450
left who the view and what you're being

817
00:37:04,170 --> 00:37:08,550
attacked who you know what threat actors

818
00:37:06,450 --> 00:37:12,149
are threatening the sector now and I'm

819
00:37:08,550 --> 00:37:13,410
talking it like in automated fashion and

820
00:37:12,150 --> 00:37:15,750
you know what I thought was interesting

821
00:37:13,410 --> 00:37:18,450
right we met with the HSI people they

822
00:37:15,750 --> 00:37:20,670
were talking about sector level socks

823
00:37:18,450 --> 00:37:22,589
and you hear and I think that's a very

824
00:37:20,670 --> 00:37:24,810
powerful concept and I think it's really

825
00:37:22,590 --> 00:37:27,120
has potential and you'll see that we've

826
00:37:24,810 --> 00:37:29,090
taken that here so from level three to

827
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:32,759
level four

828
00:37:29,090 --> 00:37:37,430
so three I'm sorry I'm going backwards

829
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:41,430
okay three part

830
00:37:37,430 --> 00:37:43,529
at level three to level four all right

831
00:37:41,430 --> 00:37:45,960
you're now getting more clusters of

832
00:37:43,530 --> 00:37:47,070
people working together and with that

833
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:49,680
comes the ability to get the

834
00:37:47,070 --> 00:37:51,300
government's attention right because if

835
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:54,270
you're an individual it's really really

836
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:56,130
hard even if you're big but if you're if

837
00:37:54,270 --> 00:37:58,230
you're acting is you know a collective

838
00:37:56,130 --> 00:38:00,330
you'll have a lot better response that

839
00:37:58,230 --> 00:38:01,830
RFI is request for information could

840
00:38:00,330 --> 00:38:04,110
work both ways you know you can work

841
00:38:01,830 --> 00:38:05,220
better across and we say you have to

842
00:38:04,110 --> 00:38:06,600
work with the government because the

843
00:38:05,220 --> 00:38:09,149
government has a monopoly on the use of

844
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:11,240
force and otherwise you're just

845
00:38:09,150 --> 00:38:13,950
defending and that's a recipe for

846
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:15,810
ultimately losing and just to show that

847
00:38:13,950 --> 00:38:18,359
we can zoom in we want to show how these

848
00:38:15,810 --> 00:38:20,850
things nest that you can zoom in and get

849
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:22,710
it like this that one sector we showed

850
00:38:20,850 --> 00:38:25,799
you could zoom into another two tier and

851
00:38:22,710 --> 00:38:27,540
show sub sectors all organized right

852
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:30,120
they at least this is the the framework

853
00:38:27,540 --> 00:38:32,279
we're trying to create and here we have

854
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:35,520
in the three healthcare sub sectors as

855
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:38,910
an example at the sophisticated level

856
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:41,040
this is what we aspire to be right and

857
00:38:38,910 --> 00:38:42,509
and this is one if you see us walking

858
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:43,980
around the conference this is one that

859
00:38:42,510 --> 00:38:46,290
we want to get right right we'd like

860
00:38:43,980 --> 00:38:53,730
we're kind of projecting what we should

861
00:38:46,290 --> 00:38:56,820
aspire to be and we go from four to five

862
00:38:53,730 --> 00:38:59,370
a lot of green the government can put

863
00:38:56,820 --> 00:39:04,680
some degree of protection around its

864
00:38:59,370 --> 00:39:06,990
population that we have not just request

865
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:09,240
for information but maybe even request

866
00:39:06,990 --> 00:39:11,370
for effects like the government a

867
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:15,029
prepackaged way to say government please

868
00:39:11,370 --> 00:39:17,220
make this stop this this entity is doing

869
00:39:15,030 --> 00:39:19,080
this thing against us and you can

870
00:39:17,220 --> 00:39:21,509
request them to stop and some automated

871
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:24,090
fashion or request for a fax or vice

872
00:39:21,510 --> 00:39:26,430
versa you may ask why are there still

873
00:39:24,090 --> 00:39:28,410
red why are there still orange well

874
00:39:26,430 --> 00:39:29,430
nothing will be perfect even in our

875
00:39:28,410 --> 00:39:31,379
ultimate future

876
00:39:29,430 --> 00:39:34,080
we live in a democracy and we like

877
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:36,540
living in democracy our ability to you

878
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:39,120
know you know dictate what people do

879
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:41,640
they don't have to do this so there's a

880
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:44,009
limit on how far even you know the best

881
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:45,629
case can be an interesting study would

882
00:39:44,010 --> 00:39:47,700
be looking at what authoritarian regimes

883
00:39:45,630 --> 00:39:50,160
or something like that could put

884
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:51,598
together you know if you can dictate

885
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:53,520
you know mandatory online identities

886
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:57,030
indicate national operating systems or

887
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:58,470
somesuch we've spoken in terms of

888
00:39:57,030 --> 00:40:00,930
sectors but this idea that we're

889
00:39:58,470 --> 00:40:03,029
proposing can be organized around cities

890
00:40:00,930 --> 00:40:05,250
you know geographic regions it can be

891
00:40:03,030 --> 00:40:07,470
organized around collect corporate

892
00:40:05,250 --> 00:40:10,140
ecosystems from suppliers to retail

893
00:40:07,470 --> 00:40:12,299
outlets it can be organized around ad

894
00:40:10,140 --> 00:40:16,770
hoc collectives of any group that has a

895
00:40:12,299 --> 00:40:18,240
common interest and we should expect

896
00:40:16,770 --> 00:40:20,099
these templates you know kind of like

897
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:21,868
Magic the Gathering card yeah they'll be

898
00:40:20,099 --> 00:40:26,010
different strategies of what will be

899
00:40:21,869 --> 00:40:28,049
applied against what that we want to we

900
00:40:26,010 --> 00:40:30,510
think there's value of linking to the

901
00:40:28,049 --> 00:40:32,759
TTP work you know like I don't really

902
00:40:30,510 --> 00:40:34,890
like that idea from the ROTC tepees

903
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:36,900
mitre attack framework all the way up to

904
00:40:34,890 --> 00:40:39,868
campaigns that be very powerful to

905
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:41,220
connect those dots we want to refine

906
00:40:39,869 --> 00:40:42,960
this we're not saying it's perfect but

907
00:40:41,220 --> 00:40:44,970
we have vetted it in a number of

908
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:46,770
communities to get it to this point

909
00:40:44,970 --> 00:40:49,669
where we're showing it to you and

910
00:40:46,770 --> 00:40:49,670
proposing it to you today

911
00:40:52,400 --> 00:41:01,230
what can help right well I think we need

912
00:40:56,549 --> 00:41:05,038
to think in longer time horizons our you

913
00:41:01,230 --> 00:41:08,069
know our view is too short and we gave a

914
00:41:05,039 --> 00:41:09,660
talk at besides Long Island and it was

915
00:41:08,069 --> 00:41:12,210
about pressure points that can take down

916
00:41:09,660 --> 00:41:13,379
cyberspace take down countries and if

917
00:41:12,210 --> 00:41:15,000
you look at it through a little tiny

918
00:41:13,380 --> 00:41:17,730
slotting window you don't notice

919
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:19,500
anything that's wrong it's like but if

920
00:41:17,730 --> 00:41:22,200
you extend that window over 20 years

921
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:24,480
you're like oh my goodness pretty much

922
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:26,189
everything's been probed and you can see

923
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:29,849
so we have to you know argue that you

924
00:41:26,190 --> 00:41:33,119
have to take a broad long term time look

925
00:41:29,849 --> 00:41:34,950
at this problem we have to if we don't

926
00:41:33,119 --> 00:41:39,539
want if we want to be continued to be

927
00:41:34,950 --> 00:41:42,930
defeated and have to work on the

928
00:41:39,539 --> 00:41:45,000
partnerships and not something this is

929
00:41:42,930 --> 00:41:46,890
easy like we didn't say this was easy

930
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:50,609
we just saying we're trying to map out a

931
00:41:46,890 --> 00:41:54,240
plan and that we need to find a way to

932
00:41:50,609 --> 00:41:55,770
coordinate defense and you know we have

933
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:58,379
to have some offense to and find a way

934
00:41:55,770 --> 00:41:59,849
to coordinate that government office

935
00:41:58,380 --> 00:42:03,059
there we're gonna have to come together

936
00:41:59,849 --> 00:42:04,279
with some playbook you know of ways we

937
00:42:03,059 --> 00:42:07,650
can work together

938
00:42:04,279 --> 00:42:10,109
doctrine collective exercises where

939
00:42:07,650 --> 00:42:12,599
people practiced you know government

940
00:42:10,109 --> 00:42:14,130
across their sector across company

941
00:42:12,599 --> 00:42:16,920
exercises government people in the room

942
00:42:14,130 --> 00:42:20,010
there are activities now which is a good

943
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:22,710
start but we need to continue that we

944
00:42:20,010 --> 00:42:26,160
and we have to look at I think automated

945
00:42:22,710 --> 00:42:28,109
response everything is you know if the

946
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:28,710
human is in the loop or if it's

947
00:42:28,109 --> 00:42:30,960
sneakernet

948
00:42:28,710 --> 00:42:32,730
we're way we got to get way beyond that

949
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:34,349
but the other hand we don't want to take

950
00:42:32,730 --> 00:42:38,309
a human entirely out of the loop and

951
00:42:34,349 --> 00:42:44,420
cause something a bad day at the other

952
00:42:38,309 --> 00:42:47,220
end of the spectrum so our conclusions

953
00:42:44,420 --> 00:42:48,599
yeah that individual companies there's

954
00:42:47,220 --> 00:42:51,660
some great companies out there and they

955
00:42:48,599 --> 00:42:58,589
could stand alone or like Minas Tirith

956
00:42:51,660 --> 00:42:59,879
it might be the last to fall right but

957
00:42:58,589 --> 00:43:02,609
we're better as a team

958
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:05,510
right so we want we if we really we have

959
00:43:02,609 --> 00:43:09,089
to bring along the small medium large

960
00:43:05,510 --> 00:43:10,950
state and local and combine that with

961
00:43:09,089 --> 00:43:12,480
the real strong player so you have to we

962
00:43:10,950 --> 00:43:16,859
have to figure out a way we've tried to

963
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:18,630
wrap map out a plan for that the you

964
00:43:16,859 --> 00:43:20,339
know the individual heroic response

965
00:43:18,630 --> 00:43:22,890
while great you give out medals for such

966
00:43:20,339 --> 00:43:26,339
things or our bonuses is not the right

967
00:43:22,890 --> 00:43:28,920
answer and that we can win or lose this

968
00:43:26,339 --> 00:43:30,900
based on our preparations right so we

969
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:35,549
have to prepare now for you know

970
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:37,500
projected bad days to come all right so

971
00:43:35,549 --> 00:43:39,900
we welcome your feedback we will be

972
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:41,339
around the conference we think this is

973
00:43:39,900 --> 00:43:43,650
really powerful really necessary this

974
00:43:41,339 --> 00:43:44,880
collective defense idea and we encourage

975
00:43:43,650 --> 00:43:47,430
you to think about these templates you

976
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:52,109
know that apply that stepwise model from

977
00:43:47,430 --> 00:43:53,910
TTP's and hire to create templates that

978
00:43:52,109 --> 00:43:57,058
you see reverse engineer what's going on

979
00:43:53,910 --> 00:43:59,759
in the news and build your own modify

980
00:43:57,059 --> 00:44:01,109
them and also you know think through how

981
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:04,400
we can really defend and that's really

982
00:44:01,109 --> 00:44:08,819
the most important thing I think for us

983
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:10,789
lots of people to to thank the HR

984
00:44:08,819 --> 00:44:15,150
community is particularly helpful a

985
00:44:10,789 --> 00:44:16,880
number of people iron net and external

986
00:44:15,150 --> 00:44:20,450
collaborators as well

987
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:25,430
all right so with that are there any

988
00:44:20,450 --> 00:44:26,660
questions yes this is a really great

989
00:44:25,430 --> 00:44:31,328
brief thank you very much

990
00:44:26,660 --> 00:44:33,920
okay it's go ahead okay

991
00:44:31,329 --> 00:44:38,960
disembodied voice is to you right here

992
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:41,029
okay all right good yeah it's like god

993
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:42,019
you're talking to me okay go ahead yeah

994
00:44:41,029 --> 00:44:45,279
excellent briefing

995
00:44:42,019 --> 00:44:47,988
it's obviously biased according to

996
00:44:45,279 --> 00:44:50,779
nothing negative according to more of

997
00:44:47,989 --> 00:44:53,599
the American or you know more democratic

998
00:44:50,779 --> 00:44:56,329
society perspective I guess has there

999
00:44:53,599 --> 00:44:59,089
been any sort of like assessment on how

1000
00:44:56,329 --> 00:45:02,059
this you know such a collective defense

1001
00:44:59,089 --> 00:45:05,660
type of strategy within a democratic

1002
00:45:02,059 --> 00:45:08,599
society would stack up against like

1003
00:45:05,660 --> 00:45:10,819
let's say a you know one that's more

1004
00:45:08,599 --> 00:45:12,499
central exercises more centralized

1005
00:45:10,819 --> 00:45:15,920
control including over the private

1006
00:45:12,499 --> 00:45:19,098
sector so I can i'll take crack with it

1007
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:21,109
so we did we're working on time like how

1008
00:45:19,099 --> 00:45:22,910
you know we try to include the right

1009
00:45:21,109 --> 00:45:25,869
amount of content and not jam in too

1010
00:45:22,910 --> 00:45:27,828
much we worked on a level six

1011
00:45:25,869 --> 00:45:29,900
authoritarian regime model or

1012
00:45:27,829 --> 00:45:31,729
totalitarian regime model because

1013
00:45:29,900 --> 00:45:34,069
there's a whole set of things the tools

1014
00:45:31,729 --> 00:45:36,499
that they could do that to their

1015
00:45:34,069 --> 00:45:39,650
populations to make them more secure

1016
00:45:36,499 --> 00:45:43,279
that's that we never work in a democracy

1017
00:45:39,650 --> 00:45:44,900
so if you watch the news and listen to

1018
00:45:43,279 --> 00:45:46,309
the news stories coming out of and I

1019
00:45:44,900 --> 00:45:48,529
really don't like calling out specific

1020
00:45:46,309 --> 00:45:50,420
countries with the obvious ones apply

1021
00:45:48,529 --> 00:45:52,880
and watch what they're doing

1022
00:45:50,420 --> 00:45:55,059
national operating systems I mean I mean

1023
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:57,289
it just it goes on you know tests of

1024
00:45:55,059 --> 00:45:59,450
shut it taking their whole country off

1025
00:45:57,289 --> 00:46:00,829
the internet I mean they're like I've

1026
00:45:59,450 --> 00:46:03,919
got a folder of like a hundred of these

1027
00:46:00,829 --> 00:46:06,019
in W great talking to itself but even

1028
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:08,420
that couldn't be seamless

1029
00:46:06,019 --> 00:46:10,038
oh yeah think about if you run

1030
00:46:08,420 --> 00:46:12,079
enterprise network defense something

1031
00:46:10,039 --> 00:46:13,849
like that you own all of the systems you

1032
00:46:12,079 --> 00:46:16,069
have the ability to dictate all of the

1033
00:46:13,849 --> 00:46:18,829
technology and the policies and even

1034
00:46:16,069 --> 00:46:20,808
then you still have shadow IT and

1035
00:46:18,829 --> 00:46:23,029
exceptions and problems so an

1036
00:46:20,809 --> 00:46:24,710
authoritative regime could probably do

1037
00:46:23,029 --> 00:46:27,259
more but there would still be some

1038
00:46:24,710 --> 00:46:29,210
shortcomings so that sort of a level of

1039
00:46:27,259 --> 00:46:29,740
control it won't be perfect we get

1040
00:46:29,210 --> 00:46:34,730
through

1041
00:46:29,740 --> 00:46:36,109
okay thank you sure and the other

1042
00:46:34,730 --> 00:46:38,120
disembodied voices that would like to

1043
00:46:36,110 --> 00:46:40,430
speak kind of a follow on to the

1044
00:46:38,120 --> 00:46:41,630
question he just asked it strikes me

1045
00:46:40,430 --> 00:46:44,600
that it might be really hard to

1046
00:46:41,630 --> 00:46:46,820
incentivize companies to collaborate

1047
00:46:44,600 --> 00:46:48,589
when they are in fierce competition with

1048
00:46:46,820 --> 00:46:51,440
each other so it's kind of a follow on

1049
00:46:48,590 --> 00:46:57,590
to the sort of fundamental problem with

1050
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:59,120
democracy so you're right right this

1051
00:46:57,590 --> 00:47:01,130
ultimately comes down to incentives

1052
00:46:59,120 --> 00:47:02,569
right you have to incentivize and that

1053
00:47:01,130 --> 00:47:04,780
can be helped with government policy

1054
00:47:02,570 --> 00:47:07,040
that maybe that takes things like

1055
00:47:04,780 --> 00:47:09,680
liabilities off the table or provides

1056
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:12,950
protections but there's a lot like I

1057
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:16,100
think we are going to lose individually

1058
00:47:12,950 --> 00:47:17,990
the math just does not work the defeat

1059
00:47:16,100 --> 00:47:20,420
in detail is super effective when you're

1060
00:47:17,990 --> 00:47:22,129
individuals to begin with so we have to

1061
00:47:20,420 --> 00:47:24,170
work through that I think one way to

1062
00:47:22,130 --> 00:47:26,930
think about it is you have an ecosystem

1063
00:47:24,170 --> 00:47:29,210
in which you need to thrive and if you

1064
00:47:26,930 --> 00:47:31,279
if that ecosystem is disrupted like if

1065
00:47:29,210 --> 00:47:33,350
you're a bank in the bank down the

1066
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:35,690
street gets hit hard and they're your

1067
00:47:33,350 --> 00:47:37,600
competitor you're still having a bad day

1068
00:47:35,690 --> 00:47:39,860
because it disrupts the whole system

1069
00:47:37,600 --> 00:47:41,990
yeah you're right I'm not saying it's

1070
00:47:39,860 --> 00:47:43,730
trivial but you've got a good point we

1071
00:47:41,990 --> 00:47:47,330
have to kind of find intelligent ways

1072
00:47:43,730 --> 00:47:49,400
one way at work we found is we focus not

1073
00:47:47,330 --> 00:47:51,890
on the internals of the network when

1074
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:54,140
we're looking at like threats we're

1075
00:47:51,890 --> 00:47:56,509
focusing what we share collectively is

1076
00:47:54,140 --> 00:47:58,670
it the external where are they coming

1077
00:47:56,510 --> 00:48:01,010
from and we've found very really no

1078
00:47:58,670 --> 00:48:02,510
resistance to that so there are you know

1079
00:48:01,010 --> 00:48:03,980
with with the creative thinking there

1080
00:48:02,510 --> 00:48:06,530
are ways you can find areas of mutual

1081
00:48:03,980 --> 00:48:09,500
interest okay and I and I think just an

1082
00:48:06,530 --> 00:48:11,570
addendum would be certain sectors are

1083
00:48:09,500 --> 00:48:13,400
more amenable to this sort of sharing

1084
00:48:11,570 --> 00:48:16,070
than others ones that already have an

1085
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:17,480
existing networked relationship so think

1086
00:48:16,070 --> 00:48:20,870
about things like the electric power

1087
00:48:17,480 --> 00:48:23,330
sector where the financials where their

1088
00:48:20,870 --> 00:48:25,009
their health and their operations are

1089
00:48:23,330 --> 00:48:27,380
highly interdependent so they have a

1090
00:48:25,010 --> 00:48:29,990
much of a collective interest in sharing

1091
00:48:27,380 --> 00:48:31,850
that the information and mitigating

1092
00:48:29,990 --> 00:48:34,520
their common threats some of the other

1093
00:48:31,850 --> 00:48:36,860
sectors up retail for example certainly

1094
00:48:34,520 --> 00:48:39,320
a point where retailers probably see a

1095
00:48:36,860 --> 00:48:42,020
bad thing to a competitor as a good

1096
00:48:39,320 --> 00:48:43,500
thing for them healthcare is another one

1097
00:48:42,020 --> 00:48:48,270
I sense a lot of clock

1098
00:48:43,500 --> 00:48:50,310
not true good yes thank you very

1099
00:48:48,270 --> 00:48:54,380
interesting topics and and great

1100
00:48:50,310 --> 00:48:57,810
strategies you mentioned degrading

1101
00:48:54,380 --> 00:49:00,390
disrupting even dissuasion really

1102
00:48:57,810 --> 00:49:02,250
interesting concepts but my question is

1103
00:49:00,390 --> 00:49:04,770
do you think that there's any risk of

1104
00:49:02,250 --> 00:49:07,200
when implementing these that it could

1105
00:49:04,770 --> 00:49:09,620
embolden the adversaries to then use

1106
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:12,140
that as justification for future

1107
00:49:09,620 --> 00:49:14,779
exercises we're talking to film forward

1108
00:49:12,140 --> 00:49:17,779
yes so I think there's there certainly

1109
00:49:14,780 --> 00:49:21,750
the idea that we probably need to

1110
00:49:17,780 --> 00:49:23,400
explore of of escalation control this

1111
00:49:21,750 --> 00:49:25,770
was something that was always part of

1112
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:28,110
sort of nuclear deterrence strategy of

1113
00:49:25,770 --> 00:49:30,540
how to play the brinksmanship but to not

1114
00:49:28,110 --> 00:49:31,980
let things get out of hand and there

1115
00:49:30,540 --> 00:49:34,710
certainly could be this case I think

1116
00:49:31,980 --> 00:49:37,530
maybe not quite as much life and death

1117
00:49:34,710 --> 00:49:39,330
but I could see a situation spiraling

1118
00:49:37,530 --> 00:49:41,670
out of control where those sorts of

1119
00:49:39,330 --> 00:49:44,060
activities become a you did this I'm

1120
00:49:41,670 --> 00:49:48,360
going to do more to you in return and

1121
00:49:44,060 --> 00:49:49,890
and and cause unintended effects so any

1122
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:51,660
of these should probably look at how do

1123
00:49:49,890 --> 00:49:53,580
we ramp things down and also keep

1124
00:49:51,660 --> 00:49:57,600
perspective the other challenge is the

1125
00:49:53,580 --> 00:49:59,790
attribution problem false flags of if I

1126
00:49:57,600 --> 00:50:02,220
if I want to escalate to the next level

1127
00:49:59,790 --> 00:50:04,590
am I sure that I'm taking this step

1128
00:50:02,220 --> 00:50:06,419
against the right target with things

1129
00:50:04,590 --> 00:50:07,770
like launching ballistic missiles it was

1130
00:50:06,420 --> 00:50:10,320
pretty sure where they were coming from

1131
00:50:07,770 --> 00:50:14,790
a cyber space attack is much harder to

1132
00:50:10,320 --> 00:50:17,100
to nail down so we've got forty seconds

1133
00:50:14,790 --> 00:50:19,080
and they'll we promised them we'd end on

1134
00:50:17,100 --> 00:50:20,490
time so we'll be right outside

1135
00:50:19,080 --> 00:50:21,840
happy to if I have any follow-up

1136
00:50:20,490 --> 00:50:22,950
conversations with you that you'd like

1137
00:50:21,840 --> 00:50:25,940
so thank you for coming we really

1138
00:50:22,950 --> 00:50:25,939
appreciate thank you
