1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,210
good afternoon welcome to exploiting

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:09,570
qualcomm WLAN and modem over the air in

3
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:12,710
lagoon GHI with shilling gong and peter

4
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:15,660
p before you begin a few brief notes

5
00:00:12,710 --> 00:00:18,300
stop by the business hall located in

6
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:21,210
mandalay bay Oceanside and shoreline

7
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:23,640
ballrooms on level two the black hat

8
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:27,510
Arsenal is in the business hall on level

9
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:28,289
two lunch is in Bayside a B from 1:00 to

10
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:30,840
2:30

11
00:00:28,289 --> 00:00:33,600
don't forget the merchandise store on

12
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:36,360
level two and session recording so mess

13
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:38,360
okay they have a desk on every level

14
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:41,309
thanks for putting your phone on vibrate

15
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:42,690
it makes it easier for the rest of us to

16
00:00:41,309 --> 00:00:45,480
ignore the ringing while you wait for

17
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:47,459
the voicemail to pick up please use the

18
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:49,828
microphones in the aisles for any

19
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:59,940
questions following the talk and with

20
00:00:49,829 --> 00:01:01,289
that let us welcome our speakers thank

21
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:06,119
you thank you very much for attending

22
00:01:01,289 --> 00:01:09,060
our talk in the talk we are share how

23
00:01:06,119 --> 00:01:11,250
easy sports kokum Davila and modern over

24
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:18,210
the air and the finally we comprise

25
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:20,700
Anelka know about us we are secure

26
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:24,559
researchers both from Tottenham player

27
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:27,060
team intellipedia team is founded by

28
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:31,710
testing the security platform Department

29
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:35,180
in 2017 we focus on security research in

30
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:40,500
the areas of a IOT mobile devices cloud

31
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:44,280
visualization application Luc to see the

32
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:49,710
agenda first we will introduce some

33
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:52,770
related work WI security is a hot topic

34
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:56,669
in recent years the Lauren exports on

35
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:59,850
Broadcom Wi-Fi chip it's on 2017 and

36
00:01:56,670 --> 00:02:03,479
this year on our today our talk is about

37
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:07,500
cocoa and we know there's no public

38
00:02:03,479 --> 00:02:11,190
redeployed on home Wi-Fi chip so how

39
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:13,680
about the cocoa my back they did a

40
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:17,400
simple illustration about the

41
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:20,930
architecture of eco home Wi-Fi to Impala

42
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:25,620
seen the first one is that start from

43
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:28,670
Snapdragon 83 5 the tabular thumb war is

44
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:31,799
integrated into the baseband subsystem

45
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:35,429
the turbulent and modern firm world are

46
00:02:31,799 --> 00:02:39,799
wrong in the same processes now the

47
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:43,970
second thing that you can see in COCOMs

48
00:02:39,799 --> 00:02:47,940
implementation most of the function

49
00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:51,930
implemented in Nina's Cano Java namkyu

50
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:54,989
say they say ard there are plenty of our

51
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:58,379
abilities in this job that is there were

52
00:02:54,989 --> 00:03:00,569
no double our hosts over abilities I was

53
00:02:58,379 --> 00:03:06,420
talking is not about the table host

54
00:03:00,569 --> 00:03:09,510
issues it is about itself there is no

55
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:12,540
public talk on the kokum Dublin from

56
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:16,760
previously so how about the security

57
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:20,400
status we will also see this question

58
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:22,769
before we go into the details of WLAN

59
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:25,079
and modern firmware but we need to

60
00:03:22,769 --> 00:03:28,290
introduce the debugger we use the to

61
00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:32,599
debug level this is the key step for us

62
00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:36,150
to analyze the modem and mm from world

63
00:03:32,599 --> 00:03:40,349
you can see it yeah MVA and the modem

64
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:42,540
images in file system MBA touch mbn is

65
00:03:40,349 --> 00:03:47,159
the MBA image modern touch

66
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:50,040
MDT and modern dot b XX modern images

67
00:03:47,159 --> 00:03:54,510
these images have a specific format

68
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:58,019
according to comms officer document like

69
00:03:54,510 --> 00:04:01,290
application processor modern processor

70
00:03:58,019 --> 00:04:04,769
also had its the secure boot flow the

71
00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:08,400
flow is like this personally Linux color

72
00:04:04,769 --> 00:04:11,400
we are load MBA and modern images from

73
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:14,069
file system to physical memory and the

74
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:17,970
second near color we are set starts

75
00:04:14,069 --> 00:04:22,560
physiologists of mb and research modern

76
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:25,889
processor then the modern ppl in the

77
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:26,350
room we are verify the MBA image even if

78
00:04:25,889 --> 00:04:30,970
the sex

79
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:34,450
we were jumped to the MBA code finally

80
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:36,730
MBA will read and verify modem images if

81
00:04:34,450 --> 00:04:41,170
success it will jump to the modern man

82
00:04:36,730 --> 00:04:44,470
code the pure function in enough Colonel

83
00:04:41,170 --> 00:04:47,470
describes a beautiful law of a modern it

84
00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:50,950
we are load and be taught ambien and

85
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:53,560
modern images to a physical memory then

86
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:56,289
trick MBA and the modem images to be

87
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:59,590
verified and executed in the modern

88
00:04:56,290 --> 00:05:02,830
processor nina color can restart a

89
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:04,239
modern processor at any time we are hit

90
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:07,300
at its function

91
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:12,370
pure puja is a time when we say when we

92
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:15,640
started the vulnerability we used to

93
00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:18,460
bypass the modern security the time of

94
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:20,909
check time of you back when I'm being

95
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:24,400
verifying modern images in a dozen

96
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:26,980
locked physical address region means

97
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:30,969
that Nina's Connor has dear modify the

98
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:35,100
model images so after M being verified

99
00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:38,290
one image Nina's Colonel can modify it

100
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:46,000
which means we have bypassed the secure

101
00:05:38,290 --> 00:05:49,870
boot check the back POC is quite simple

102
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:52,690
David give 500 people function we just

103
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:55,900
change the period of a machine we let

104
00:05:52,690 --> 00:06:02,140
the clear we climb a mountain after we

105
00:05:55,900 --> 00:06:05,229
have modified them modem images after we

106
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:08,680
have ability to modify the modem a new

107
00:06:05,230 --> 00:06:14,050
images we can inject the backs our to

108
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:17,830
modern side we injected the most the

109
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:23,140
most read to read for command from Nina

110
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:26,260
beside the commands and without we are P

111
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:30,370
exchange either using share the physical

112
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:32,770
memory so we can issue in debug command

113
00:06:30,370 --> 00:06:35,560
to debug turbulent and the modern

114
00:06:32,770 --> 00:06:40,299
firmware because they are import post

115
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:43,479
modern processors now we have the

116
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:46,870
ibaka we can analyze the modern and a

117
00:06:43,479 --> 00:06:52,270
turbulent much either so shitting we

118
00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:54,430
reduce the following integers okay so

119
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:57,818
our introduces a we were sending meaning

120
00:06:54,430 --> 00:07:00,849
and the 3d and exploitation and the

121
00:06:57,819 --> 00:07:07,810
finally we all fall into the next

122
00:07:00,849 --> 00:07:09,969
Connell okay nude

123
00:07:07,810 --> 00:07:12,129
a detective Cohen table man the

124
00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:15,819
turbulence is law in the best band and

125
00:07:12,129 --> 00:07:18,610
hexagon edge temperature so that we can

126
00:07:15,819 --> 00:07:20,800
analyze the turbulent and if we control

127
00:07:18,610 --> 00:07:24,520
the towel and we will control the base

128
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:26,909
band subsystem okay here is a simple

129
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:30,310
figure for the turbulent odd structure

130
00:07:26,909 --> 00:07:32,199
and from the figure you can see that the

131
00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:35,560
Cohen table on firmware is a lot of the

132
00:07:32,199 --> 00:07:38,560
faux for mac from work most of the

133
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:43,060
functions of Dublin are implemented in

134
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:46,509
the next hour here you see a CRT and the

135
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:50,020
firmware itself quite simple and just

136
00:07:46,509 --> 00:07:52,300
didn't were smaller catastrophes the

137
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:56,049
world to design in the framework the

138
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:58,449
called awful odor we upload the murderer

139
00:07:56,050 --> 00:08:01,150
attack surface I think is in upload

140
00:07:58,449 --> 00:08:02,529
handler here no floaters handler the

141
00:08:01,150 --> 00:08:06,580
long tail of redondela

142
00:08:02,529 --> 00:08:09,159
and death analog and the awkward handler

143
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:12,430
will inspect the out here packet oh and

144
00:08:09,159 --> 00:08:15,699
if interested in your past the popular

145
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:19,479
and to send your accordingly so the

146
00:08:15,699 --> 00:08:22,779
attack could happen here when the handle

147
00:08:19,479 --> 00:08:25,960
pass the passer the off-road handler is

148
00:08:22,779 --> 00:08:28,389
in fact a table with some different

149
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:34,000
handles according to the status of the

150
00:08:28,389 --> 00:08:37,479
Wi-Fi okay

151
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:40,299
give an example for the how a Wi-Fi

152
00:08:37,479 --> 00:08:45,640
access point is this displayed on the

153
00:08:40,299 --> 00:08:48,250
wafer Easter when you open the Wi-Fi on

154
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:50,560
the UI the android framework we are

155
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:52,630
usually commander to the driver under

156
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:54,760
the chair will commander the former to

157
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:57,970
scan the nearby Wi-Fi hotspot

158
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:59,829
finally the WLAN from where we stood the

159
00:08:57,970 --> 00:09:02,490
handlers into the off-road the handler

160
00:08:59,829 --> 00:09:06,399
table you can see into this table and

161
00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:09,670
when other Excel printer or hotspot send

162
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:13,410
a package the handler will receive and

163
00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:17,110
pass the incoming packet and if the

164
00:09:13,410 --> 00:09:18,790
factory is a management of become the

165
00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:23,769
firmware we are forwarded through the

166
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:27,370
Linux and the Trevor will pass the packs

167
00:09:23,769 --> 00:09:30,279
and each track the SSID and notify the

168
00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:34,690
user space application and the family

169
00:09:30,279 --> 00:09:42,160
you'll see the what happened hotspot is

170
00:09:34,690 --> 00:09:44,110
displayed here ok so now we have some

171
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:47,829
ethical things about the public line

172
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:51,550
this is part of a state in the Union the

173
00:09:47,829 --> 00:09:54,790
firmware is noted here and noted about a

174
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:57,880
modem is this file you can find it from

175
00:09:54,790 --> 00:10:02,199
the phone and here you notice a similar

176
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:04,449
and conquer the providers wonderful SDK

177
00:10:02,199 --> 00:10:08,349
and the instruction reference here if

178
00:10:04,449 --> 00:10:14,649
you're interested in ok the WLAN firm

179
00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:16,540
has 18 8 sudden the functions is a

180
00:10:14,649 --> 00:10:19,540
difficult trafficker to reverse these

181
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:22,930
functions without any knowledge knock

182
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:25,420
the quadrant have give us some hint the

183
00:10:22,930 --> 00:10:28,750
most useful senior staff the student

184
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:32,260
table in the student table we can find a

185
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:34,389
lot of useful function names and another

186
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:34,959
important thing is the important

187
00:10:34,389 --> 00:10:37,420
function

188
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:39,550
yeah because the table long from work is

189
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:41,769
loaded by the model I'll share the

190
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:43,569
library so the table line will be using

191
00:10:41,769 --> 00:10:45,940
a lot of functions from the model and

192
00:10:43,569 --> 00:10:52,660
leave the function name in the import

193
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:54,910
function table that has a useful ok the

194
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:59,170
tablet we are going to reverse engineer

195
00:10:54,910 --> 00:11:02,529
ian is a fraud handler into the module

196
00:10:59,170 --> 00:11:05,469
type service over the air the main

197
00:11:02,529 --> 00:11:06,130
questions how can you find a fraud

198
00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:08,080
handler

199
00:11:06,130 --> 00:11:09,880
the answer is that you

200
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:13,810
confessor finder decision from the

201
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:15,970
surgeon table that I used London offload

202
00:11:13,810 --> 00:11:19,869
and then check the reference of the

203
00:11:15,970 --> 00:11:22,120
screen to find the function named London

204
00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:26,350
for handle and this function is actually

205
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:28,510
a very big loop interface each ad home

206
00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:33,430
from the table and the cord the handler

207
00:11:28,510 --> 00:11:37,870
okay each handling is a function just

208
00:11:33,430 --> 00:11:40,030
loop from your quote from the top here

209
00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:43,210
you know sample of the odd follow the

210
00:11:40,030 --> 00:11:47,410
handler in the table the key to reversed

211
00:11:43,210 --> 00:11:49,270
you to find that the data pointer from

212
00:11:47,410 --> 00:11:51,579
the figure we can see that this has

213
00:11:49,270 --> 00:11:54,030
simple the data pointer is a pointer

214
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:58,510
camp and the Bangor four bytes

215
00:11:54,030 --> 00:12:01,120
58 or 59 fifty eight fifty P this is a

216
00:11:58,510 --> 00:12:04,120
package of data over the air if we using

217
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:06,190
the data packs using the buffer tango

218
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:09,280
other device you'll find that your data

219
00:12:06,190 --> 00:12:11,230
either here you need in this window so

220
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:14,829
when you upload the handle has the same

221
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:18,160
structures I think this is the most

222
00:12:14,830 --> 00:12:20,710
important sliding in this talk with the

223
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:22,780
sample of the handler you can just

224
00:12:20,710 --> 00:12:24,970
simply walk us through all the other

225
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:27,280
hundreds and and and that's how the

226
00:12:24,970 --> 00:12:27,910
handle process the packet ER and the

227
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:32,110
hunter

228
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:33,280
vanellope it is yes this is the most

229
00:12:32,110 --> 00:12:38,340
important right

230
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:44,949
as in released for the data pointer here

231
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:48,190
okay you can see here in Stella pointer

232
00:12:44,950 --> 00:12:52,230
and we fake he won by the from the data

233
00:12:48,190 --> 00:12:55,900
and the taste of the sea test ender see

234
00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:58,540
from the specification of tablet line we

235
00:12:55,900 --> 00:13:00,250
know we tested this bad means to test of

236
00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:06,910
whether this Factory in the management

237
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:12,600
of beacon okay so now you can start the

238
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:16,540
exploitation this is a overall load map

239
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:18,910
we are here not we we have controlled by

240
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:21,319
fired tango or something else first and

241
00:13:18,910 --> 00:13:25,280
also by singular

242
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:28,490
we are going to compromise a WLAN yes

243
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:31,790
this is over the earth and then we

244
00:13:28,490 --> 00:13:34,010
escape into modern and finally we are

245
00:13:31,790 --> 00:13:38,170
getting to the linear kernel to come

246
00:13:34,010 --> 00:13:41,330
clean to the fact we learned again

247
00:13:38,170 --> 00:13:44,589
before you go let's first check in the

248
00:13:41,330 --> 00:13:47,990
medication status of mm to set up an

249
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:53,750
implementation strategy from the table

250
00:13:47,990 --> 00:13:58,760
we can see that the heat protections hip

251
00:13:53,750 --> 00:14:01,820
s they are hip cookie which he makes the

252
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:07,340
hip overflow issue pretty difficult to

253
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:11,740
exploit and you know the stock cookie

254
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:15,260
and the our friend limit and the ten GS

255
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:19,130
protection so we are unable to use the

256
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:23,000
traditional RP RP you are unable to

257
00:14:19,130 --> 00:14:27,790
deliver because protections and also

258
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:31,130
they are TV so we are unable to execute

259
00:14:27,790 --> 00:14:33,230
in the data segment and also we are

260
00:14:31,130 --> 00:14:36,470
unable to write for the code segment

261
00:14:33,230 --> 00:14:38,750
directory if we want to run arbitrary

262
00:14:36,470 --> 00:14:43,910
code we should have change the page

263
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:46,930
attribution first okay the so many

264
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:52,370
medications but obviously oh very lucky

265
00:14:46,930 --> 00:14:56,839
you can see the code is not enabled and

266
00:14:52,370 --> 00:15:00,680
the global data data is not enabled so

267
00:14:56,840 --> 00:15:02,840
the code is fixed you know you no fixed

268
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:07,459
address and the claw hello what they

269
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:08,450
tell you no fixed address and CF is also

270
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:11,900
not enabled

271
00:15:08,450 --> 00:15:15,110
so although we are unable to use our P

272
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:18,800
we can use something called a function

273
00:15:15,110 --> 00:15:23,960
oriented programming that is FOP to

274
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:27,380
bypass to do the job like the RP that'll

275
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:30,140
FOP you'll see NATO unit fluent ation

276
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:33,260
that all the character in the FOP and

277
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:35,360
constructed by a series of function

278
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:39,680
course

279
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:44,779
and also lucky the issue we found in the

280
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:47,359
in the global data area yes the overflow

281
00:15:44,779 --> 00:15:50,930
we found in Unicode whatever that area

282
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:52,850
so there's no SAR and every can overflow

283
00:15:50,930 --> 00:15:56,739
to a fixed 30s

284
00:15:52,850 --> 00:16:05,209
okay let's check out the vulnerability

285
00:15:56,740 --> 00:16:07,100
the wannabe tcv 2019 105 40 already been

286
00:16:05,209 --> 00:16:10,189
announced in the Android and the co

287
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:13,040
count of the security provision already

288
00:16:10,190 --> 00:16:14,839
been patched if your incision about the

289
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:17,959
detailed information of the wannabe t

290
00:16:14,839 --> 00:16:20,959
please check of the secretive region of

291
00:16:17,959 --> 00:16:25,880
the 2019 they see he already have them

292
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:30,018
fixed okay this is the upload the

293
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:34,970
handler you know this table so you know

294
00:16:30,019 --> 00:16:39,290
of this table and it's in the Prius

295
00:16:34,970 --> 00:16:41,990
friend handler the Prius means you don't

296
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:45,529
have to connect it to specify the Wi-Fi

297
00:16:41,990 --> 00:16:47,870
pointer you just turn on the Wi-Fi we

298
00:16:45,529 --> 00:16:52,519
are leading to one a level okay from

299
00:16:47,870 --> 00:16:55,070
your offspring handle okay I would

300
00:16:52,519 --> 00:16:58,010
translate it and simplify that the

301
00:16:55,070 --> 00:17:01,730
assembler code in to see colors so you

302
00:16:58,010 --> 00:17:06,939
can see here this is a proper and grow

303
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:10,280
Baba or Hal 10 items and this is a loop

304
00:17:06,939 --> 00:17:12,650
which she coffee and the Marty held at

305
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:16,099
her totally possible into the global

306
00:17:12,650 --> 00:17:19,699
buffer this is no chick on the desert

307
00:17:16,099 --> 00:17:22,549
cunt and the sender 11 items will cause

308
00:17:19,699 --> 00:17:28,370
a global buffer overflow this is a

309
00:17:22,549 --> 00:17:30,740
straightforward and ok run the

310
00:17:28,369 --> 00:17:31,909
reliability code we know that is no

311
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:37,190
interval copy

312
00:17:31,910 --> 00:17:40,540
however 44 bytes should all flow we can

313
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:44,450
all write the content after this point

314
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:47,389
the core power has speed yellow and into

315
00:17:44,450 --> 00:17:49,000
this the folder we are overflow into all

316
00:17:47,390 --> 00:17:52,790
this data

317
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:55,460
okay because there's no ACR the GS

318
00:17:52,790 --> 00:17:58,670
address love the all over Delhi to fix

319
00:17:55,460 --> 00:18:04,280
them so this had a convenient of our 22

320
00:17:58,670 --> 00:18:07,160
links protection and unless the data

321
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:10,250
Nieto approaches we can quickly find out

322
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:14,059
that there is a very good data point her

323
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:16,850
and after the see we over from here and

324
00:18:14,059 --> 00:18:20,690
after that was see there is a very good

325
00:18:16,850 --> 00:18:24,070
data point we call it the smart pointer

326
00:18:20,690 --> 00:18:27,920
which he pointed to a very useful data

327
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:32,689
if we override the smart pointer we can

328
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:36,260
do a lot of good a job okay let's check

329
00:18:32,690 --> 00:18:38,210
the utility of the smart point to fit

330
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:40,640
understanding the code I will transfer

331
00:18:38,210 --> 00:18:42,890
the call to see and the simplified of

332
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:45,800
them typo and this figure you can see

333
00:18:42,890 --> 00:18:49,670
this is a smart pointer we can override

334
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:51,740
it and this is the factory standard the

335
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:55,220
out here package' we send us through the

336
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:57,470
Wi-Fi dongle this is our data you can

337
00:18:55,220 --> 00:19:01,429
follow this data and this is the

338
00:18:57,470 --> 00:19:01,850
override our fraud to have control Smart

339
00:19:01,429 --> 00:19:08,990
Folder

340
00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:12,260
there are two two conditions to test the

341
00:19:08,990 --> 00:19:15,650
first test is that we tested that

342
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:18,290
detonate agian whether the no is the

343
00:19:15,650 --> 00:19:21,590
beta is equal to 1 and the think the

344
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:25,610
second test in that at them tomorrow

345
00:19:21,590 --> 00:19:29,590
enter has 6 equal to the micro address

346
00:19:25,610 --> 00:19:33,860
of the sender info posts the test pass

347
00:19:29,590 --> 00:19:41,928
we can't write her to with robots

348
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:46,090
reverse CD and the 14 and 3 baths so ok

349
00:19:41,929 --> 00:19:49,730
let's see again we go right this this

350
00:19:46,090 --> 00:19:53,629
address this a smart pointer and we will

351
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:57,669
test if the Tesla pass we write to the

352
00:19:53,630 --> 00:20:01,100
three points so now we caught an

353
00:19:57,669 --> 00:20:04,639
arbitrary rather primitive little tokens

354
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:07,908
questions the first conscience Cassandra

355
00:20:04,639 --> 00:20:10,969
is a PETA Dillo and the second agenda is

356
00:20:07,909 --> 00:20:14,630
the mark IDs I adore the MAC address is

357
00:20:10,970 --> 00:20:17,750
a controlled controlled by also so this

358
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:22,669
is not in fact the motor and constraint

359
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:25,700
we can and so how data data sent a real

360
00:20:22,669 --> 00:20:28,429
democracy s equal to this pointer so the

361
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:30,710
only constraint is this this one the

362
00:20:28,429 --> 00:20:33,559
lowest repeater should L equal to 1 okay

363
00:20:30,710 --> 00:20:36,649
if we pass this test we can write the

364
00:20:33,559 --> 00:20:39,678
two bytes or three bites into the nation

365
00:20:36,649 --> 00:20:43,850
yeah I will interesting write to someone

366
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:46,879
else I would use this picture okay there

367
00:20:43,850 --> 00:20:50,240
are actually two steps the first step we

368
00:20:46,879 --> 00:20:52,908
are send a factor to cheek the overflow

369
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:55,250
and all right the content of smart

370
00:20:52,909 --> 00:20:58,669
pointer to our destination we are

371
00:20:55,250 --> 00:21:01,850
including and the cylinder step we are

372
00:20:58,669 --> 00:21:05,690
sending another packet to use this new

373
00:21:01,850 --> 00:21:09,019
smart pointer to compare and even pass

374
00:21:05,690 --> 00:21:10,070
we are write something into the new

375
00:21:09,019 --> 00:21:13,269
destination

376
00:21:10,070 --> 00:21:16,639
so now we can write a two bytes you know

377
00:21:13,269 --> 00:21:24,039
one rapidity through bytes to arbitrary

378
00:21:16,639 --> 00:21:24,039
bytes so another question is how

379
00:21:25,269 --> 00:21:31,909
meaningful us or data all the four bytes

380
00:21:29,029 --> 00:21:33,309
now we can write off provides how to

381
00:21:31,909 --> 00:21:36,830
write or four bytes

382
00:21:33,309 --> 00:21:39,320
this figure shows the answer answer as

383
00:21:36,830 --> 00:21:42,470
simple data using the right chest

384
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:45,350
the first hand we write for the no

385
00:21:42,470 --> 00:21:46,700
toolbars and the second time we write to

386
00:21:45,350 --> 00:21:50,529
the hide toolbars

387
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:53,779
okay gotta move the smartphone under

388
00:21:50,529 --> 00:21:57,590
advanced officer the bathroom and you

389
00:21:53,779 --> 00:22:00,529
see we can write those whole four bytes

390
00:21:57,590 --> 00:22:04,240
okay and there is the another question

391
00:22:00,529 --> 00:22:06,500
you know we have a constrained the

392
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:09,590
destination we want to write should have

393
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:12,919
this bit so that one so how about and

394
00:22:09,590 --> 00:22:14,929
for this beta you develop the answer

395
00:22:12,919 --> 00:22:16,490
that mean precise up

396
00:22:14,930 --> 00:22:21,440
to check out whether we consider these

397
00:22:16,490 --> 00:22:24,740
people mr. job under CA yes this in the

398
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:28,580
1 so we can write to this address and

399
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:35,570
then we write to the target oh you want

400
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:38,840
a true ok so now we got a a powerful

401
00:22:35,570 --> 00:22:41,480
global rather limit here although we

402
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:44,480
have the constraint we should have a bit

403
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:48,020
of the loader that we want but it's

404
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:50,240
still very powerful let's see how we use

405
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:53,720
the global right to control the PC and

406
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:56,600
are below the petaca message here

407
00:22:53,720 --> 00:23:00,560
we search the one memory space and find

408
00:22:56,600 --> 00:23:04,850
out the meaningful trace where satisfy

409
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:10,129
the condition which power remote factor

410
00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:13,550
and that is an interesting by asked for

411
00:23:10,130 --> 00:23:18,700
example you can see here they use a PC

412
00:23:13,550 --> 00:23:21,800
and a below if we could control our Brad

413
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:25,300
these 4 bytes and over Brad Whitford yes

414
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:28,280
we can control the PC Anna are below ok

415
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:31,790
this is not very difficult to find a

416
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:34,879
place similar to this in this table you

417
00:23:31,790 --> 00:23:38,570
can see we have a lot of Peter Peter

418
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:40,940
yellow equal to 1 so we can move this

419
00:23:38,570 --> 00:23:44,210
map pointer down move down

420
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:50,990
hold on and finally we can write to this

421
00:23:44,210 --> 00:23:54,950
address using arbitrary right ok so now

422
00:23:50,990 --> 00:23:58,390
how we have controlled the PC and below

423
00:23:54,950 --> 00:24:01,820
we can we can do some beautiful things

424
00:23:58,390 --> 00:24:04,670
the first thing we wanted to in to

425
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:06,679
remove the constraint the constraint

426
00:24:04,670 --> 00:24:10,340
that is removed

427
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:14,440
condition so we wanted to transfer on

428
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:15,620
this global writer to arbitrary right

429
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:18,500
okay

430
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:21,379
the global right we have we see a lot of

431
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:23,060
very convenient because the place we

432
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:26,810
wanted to write should have the lowest

433
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:28,520
theater so that one January with a

434
00:24:26,810 --> 00:24:31,550
better chance to fall into

435
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:34,690
arbitrary right okay and we have

436
00:24:31,550 --> 00:24:38,809
controlled the PC and the other we can

437
00:24:34,690 --> 00:24:41,929
trigger some FOP to do the job the FOP

438
00:24:38,809 --> 00:24:44,450
you know function I mean he the program

439
00:24:41,929 --> 00:24:48,170
I mean okay we controlled the PC and

440
00:24:44,450 --> 00:24:53,660
availa we centered available our payload

441
00:24:48,170 --> 00:24:55,970
and then she this this function and the

442
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:58,550
chicken is calculate now finally you

443
00:24:55,970 --> 00:25:05,960
will see that we have rather arbitrary

444
00:24:58,550 --> 00:25:08,570
path to arbitrary address okay so we can

445
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:12,860
to arbitrary right

446
00:25:08,570 --> 00:25:18,620
we can run some other useful for peace

447
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:21,770
to do more complex job to do the job we

448
00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:23,959
have a three states the first one we

449
00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:26,720
override one of the use of a function

450
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:28,610
pointer is appearing right

451
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:33,260
the pointer shouldn't be able to achieve

452
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:37,100
run the hotel package and second one we

453
00:25:33,260 --> 00:25:40,040
override one of the parameter generally

454
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:43,639
you know we all granted a data point of

455
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:48,230
our meal oh okay we change it to our

456
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:50,210
pillow and the stateful service tape we

457
00:25:48,230 --> 00:25:52,460
send the pellet pack hunter and the

458
00:25:50,210 --> 00:25:56,290
cheek of the function then our for

459
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:59,330
peacock until Runyan for example how we

460
00:25:56,290 --> 00:26:02,320
modify attribute enough of the page

461
00:25:59,330 --> 00:26:05,629
you know we have OTP so we have to

462
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:10,610
modify the attribution of the memory

463
00:26:05,630 --> 00:26:12,910
page so now we can run useful if FOP to

464
00:26:10,610 --> 00:26:16,100
do the job okay

465
00:26:12,910 --> 00:26:19,929
the function we're going to call in the

466
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:23,809
creative marketing function it Maps the

467
00:26:19,929 --> 00:26:27,050
physical address to the virtual address

468
00:26:23,809 --> 00:26:32,230
we want and sort of the specify the

469
00:26:27,050 --> 00:26:38,480
permission for example the this a gs-9

470
00:26:32,230 --> 00:26:42,410
swiss six a the back into p yellow

471
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:45,170
yellow with a medium i guess that

472
00:26:42,410 --> 00:26:48,170
Rheda only and if the cuter one it's in

473
00:26:45,170 --> 00:26:50,720
the coda finger mandir cinnamon so but

474
00:26:48,170 --> 00:26:53,300
chickadees no function we can map a

475
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:56,900
little sway none of another address here

476
00:26:53,300 --> 00:27:00,139
we use photo photo to add up the eggs

477
00:26:56,900 --> 00:27:04,940
that I use the for permission read write

478
00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:07,910
and execute herbal so now we have a page

479
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:14,630
that is our table X yeah we come right

480
00:27:07,910 --> 00:27:18,200
into it and execute on this page okay so

481
00:27:14,630 --> 00:27:22,780
another thing we want to do to copy our

482
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:25,460
shellcode into the page with just my pod

483
00:27:22,780 --> 00:27:28,700
that we just want to copy the shellcode

484
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:31,790
a photo photo it's crazy

485
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:39,350
oh we can do a picture right and we have

486
00:27:31,790 --> 00:27:41,810
a page that is a lot of choice the scene

487
00:27:39,350 --> 00:27:44,510
had to you know override work the

488
00:27:41,810 --> 00:27:48,110
handler in the off-road hundred table so

489
00:27:44,510 --> 00:27:51,200
that the r1 is originally suited to the

490
00:27:48,110 --> 00:27:54,350
packet we send and the death alliances

491
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:58,190
are true so we grabbed the pc the family

492
00:27:54,350 --> 00:28:01,939
pointer and the dead of winter then we

493
00:27:58,190 --> 00:28:05,240
can hope your shellcode to the envelope

494
00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:10,610
we want true that is a photo photo we

495
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:12,410
just mapped our altar to be rwx so we

496
00:28:10,610 --> 00:28:19,939
come to the shellcode auto photo photo

497
00:28:12,410 --> 00:28:23,450
we are able to okay trigger geocode so

498
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:25,370
now we can run an app into a cold you

499
00:28:23,450 --> 00:28:29,560
know WM from work okay

500
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:33,100
just achieve of shellcode in this age is

501
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:37,159
okay okay

502
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:40,189
no we are in the WLAN

503
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:46,040
the next step it will escape in through

504
00:28:40,190 --> 00:28:50,720
the model okay this is a lot of map and

505
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:55,500
we are now here are not France from here

506
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:59,010
to here now we are here we are going to

507
00:28:55,500 --> 00:29:01,200
the modern okay the tablet line and the

508
00:28:59,010 --> 00:29:04,140
modern I different the processor this is

509
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:07,680
in the best banner system okay so here

510
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:11,400
this is a CRT always criminal and the

511
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:14,190
different processes so how can we get

512
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:17,450
into the model and there is actually

513
00:29:14,190 --> 00:29:21,390
some data versus occasions we can do

514
00:29:17,450 --> 00:29:24,690
just in this table some tenures

515
00:29:21,390 --> 00:29:28,890
dangerous actions in the tablet land we

516
00:29:24,690 --> 00:29:31,710
came to forgive and we can try to write

517
00:29:28,890 --> 00:29:35,160
the modern memory directly in the

518
00:29:31,710 --> 00:29:38,160
turbulent also we can share to call the

519
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:41,940
model own functions and we can try but

520
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:46,260
it will fail i think that maybe some

521
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:47,430
protections I don't know why this is

522
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:51,210
illegal

523
00:29:47,430 --> 00:29:57,180
okay and also we are unable to modify

524
00:29:51,210 --> 00:30:00,480
the memory memory attribution of the

525
00:29:57,180 --> 00:30:03,260
modern during the instruction we are

526
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:05,730
unable to do this to this video cause

527
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:08,730
modern crash okay

528
00:30:05,730 --> 00:30:12,900
but finally we have found out that we

529
00:30:08,730 --> 00:30:14,010
can map the memory of modern into tabula

530
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:17,040
the directory

531
00:30:14,010 --> 00:30:21,690
you know the turbulent and modern I am

532
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:24,030
different which is aqueous base but we

533
00:30:21,690 --> 00:30:28,290
can map the more modern memory inaudible

534
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:31,260
and just like this figure originally the

535
00:30:28,290 --> 00:30:33,300
modern physical address of modern is

536
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:37,950
back into the virtual ages of modern

537
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:41,580
itself and mm - mm itself or not we can

538
00:30:37,950 --> 00:30:45,360
make the modern memory into Dublin

539
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:50,879
address base directory so that after we

540
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:53,639
do the mapping we can modify the nervous

541
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:56,610
basis of modern to add operation in the

542
00:30:53,640 --> 00:31:00,810
turbulence and so that we can change the

543
00:30:56,610 --> 00:31:03,540
code of modern and obviously we can run

544
00:31:00,810 --> 00:31:03,870
arbitrary code in the tabular are in the

545
00:31:03,540 --> 00:31:08,000
model

546
00:31:03,870 --> 00:31:08,000
so now we are getting into model

547
00:31:09,539 --> 00:31:16,470
okay so let's see how to escape into

548
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:22,240
that in a second

549
00:31:16,470 --> 00:31:28,169
from water okay so we are here we are in

550
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:32,259
the modern of and intro here to release

551
00:31:28,169 --> 00:31:36,039
the disbanded subsystem is on a separate

552
00:31:32,259 --> 00:31:38,649
averse chief not on the main chief not

553
00:31:36,039 --> 00:31:40,929
name is Colonel Ronny the lot of reinter

554
00:31:38,649 --> 00:31:45,969
first each one behind the subsystem and

555
00:31:40,929 --> 00:31:49,899
the next econo each other in the face

556
00:31:45,970 --> 00:31:52,690
yes in Atticus office example there are

557
00:31:49,899 --> 00:31:55,570
many turbulent hostile issues in Angela

558
00:31:52,690 --> 00:31:57,940
secretive Lincoln a woman's most of them

559
00:31:55,570 --> 00:32:00,970
are former to the infection or when

560
00:31:57,940 --> 00:32:03,279
abilities the issues should be used to

561
00:32:00,970 --> 00:32:06,549
escape him from the best vandal into

562
00:32:03,279 --> 00:32:08,649
Linux kernel and there are also a taken

563
00:32:06,549 --> 00:32:11,679
attacker service for a modern into high

564
00:32:08,649 --> 00:32:16,000
priority to the process process and also

565
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:21,399
maybe into the trust trust them if I use

566
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:24,779
is interesting you can check okay so for

567
00:32:21,399 --> 00:32:31,139
an ability we are using uses the CVE

568
00:32:24,779 --> 00:32:35,259
2019 105 of 38 okay

569
00:32:31,139 --> 00:32:37,840
yah-yah-yah attack surface okay

570
00:32:35,259 --> 00:32:39,970
this issue already been fixed in the

571
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:42,340
orbit rank under security provision and

572
00:32:39,970 --> 00:32:46,299
if you are interested about that detail

573
00:32:42,340 --> 00:32:49,629
please check out of the entire security

574
00:32:46,299 --> 00:32:53,110
freaking you can find the conative is

575
00:32:49,629 --> 00:32:59,439
already public about the Khalif against

576
00:32:53,110 --> 00:33:02,139
jared coded evil okay some checker for

577
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:07,210
the incoming data packets from the model

578
00:33:02,139 --> 00:33:13,959
in the kernel driver there are some in

579
00:33:07,210 --> 00:33:17,559
checker evil okay actually it's about

580
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:20,490
the memory management of the coho

581
00:33:17,559 --> 00:33:20,490
multiprocessor architecture

582
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:30,209
imagine management is a quite a big

583
00:33:23,820 --> 00:33:34,439
talker in fact here you need to know

584
00:33:30,210 --> 00:33:39,870
United for since master model Linnaeus

585
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:42,929
master model and the SMM I knew the the

586
00:33:39,870 --> 00:33:47,239
martin model it means that the

587
00:33:42,929 --> 00:33:51,990
university said the owner of the memory

588
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:54,210
for example the winners owns this this

589
00:33:51,990 --> 00:33:58,289
memory so how to gather them memory

590
00:33:54,210 --> 00:34:01,230
fabulous actually we are a fan a

591
00:33:58,289 --> 00:34:03,840
scientist memory true winners before the

592
00:34:01,230 --> 00:34:07,230
time to Venus Manasa

593
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:10,529
unable to touch this memory okay so

594
00:34:07,230 --> 00:34:18,290
after have offended the memory to win us

595
00:34:10,530 --> 00:34:23,149
the SMU we are protected in toad

596
00:34:18,290 --> 00:34:27,000
protected and if with the model or other

597
00:34:23,149 --> 00:34:29,299
subsystem I wanted to access into this

598
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:30,480
memory the core system we are crash

599
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:33,389
nothing

600
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:35,399
I mean you to him into the protection

601
00:34:33,389 --> 00:34:37,919
memory to make sure the memory

602
00:34:35,399 --> 00:34:42,179
assignment by the neck for cervical and

603
00:34:37,918 --> 00:34:45,149
we expected okay so another another

604
00:34:42,179 --> 00:34:49,429
example from this memory is owned by the

605
00:34:45,149 --> 00:34:54,359
model so we NASA and Linux the unable to

606
00:34:49,429 --> 00:34:58,740
touch this memory but the job the

607
00:34:54,359 --> 00:35:03,119
company periodic decide the address and

608
00:34:58,740 --> 00:35:05,790
the the owner of this memory this is

609
00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:13,490
Linux master model and the SMN your

610
00:35:05,790 --> 00:35:19,140
protection okay so the issue here about

611
00:35:13,490 --> 00:35:23,689
three 105 of 38 here in the memory

612
00:35:19,140 --> 00:35:27,810
management no is actually a mystery

613
00:35:23,690 --> 00:35:31,440
logical generally means itself where we

614
00:35:27,810 --> 00:35:35,690
are desirable to us and said to a fan to

615
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:42,109
other subsystem but here

616
00:35:35,690 --> 00:35:47,210
can see the modern how sent in ages and

617
00:35:42,109 --> 00:35:49,520
the science to Linux and then we are fan

618
00:35:47,210 --> 00:35:52,790
you through modernity victory without

619
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:55,609
any chick I don't know why I suggest

620
00:35:52,790 --> 00:35:58,160
address is decided by the modern you

621
00:35:55,609 --> 00:36:00,799
know nice modern model is decided by the

622
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:05,810
university so follow here this mysteries

623
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:10,240
Cotto has been very very wonderful for

624
00:36:05,810 --> 00:36:16,369
us to enjoy it because we can map any

625
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:19,279
physical memory designed of us because

626
00:36:16,369 --> 00:36:25,010
we have controlled the modern we can use

627
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:27,800
any filter memory we can here tell the

628
00:36:25,010 --> 00:36:28,670
universe we want to this memory then the

629
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:32,060
next year

630
00:36:28,670 --> 00:36:34,579
it's an this memory for us so we we can

631
00:36:32,060 --> 00:36:38,410
hold in this memory if we tell the Nina

632
00:36:34,579 --> 00:36:42,440
versatile or kill the code of codon

633
00:36:38,410 --> 00:36:45,950
external to us integral to what we want

634
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:48,650
so this is the one ability we tell them

635
00:36:45,950 --> 00:36:52,549
niggas not a we want a record called

636
00:36:48,650 --> 00:36:56,060
space of Linux serving as a window to us

637
00:36:52,550 --> 00:36:58,849
and so that we can we can modify the

638
00:36:56,060 --> 00:37:01,609
content of the cannot hold so we have

639
00:36:58,849 --> 00:37:04,869
when eventually memory right of the

640
00:37:01,609 --> 00:37:08,839
linear kernel that's vulnerability

641
00:37:04,869 --> 00:37:09,619
please know that this one bit is pretty

642
00:37:08,839 --> 00:37:12,440
powerful

643
00:37:09,619 --> 00:37:15,829
we just bypassed any bit occasions in

644
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:18,740
the kernel people we are using the

645
00:37:15,829 --> 00:37:23,240
physical physical memory and he have

646
00:37:18,740 --> 00:37:26,598
just the physical memory and we can

647
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:27,770
bypass the a-kor and other medications

648
00:37:26,599 --> 00:37:36,050
in any sense

649
00:37:27,770 --> 00:37:40,460
use this okay so we have breaks into the

650
00:37:36,050 --> 00:37:42,530
kernel people we watch is a demo I'm

651
00:37:40,460 --> 00:37:45,740
gonna talk a little more about of

652
00:37:42,530 --> 00:37:48,100
stability of the occasion because we are

653
00:37:45,740 --> 00:37:49,930
sender the popular over the air

654
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:56,160
and so the by this the pack you feel

655
00:37:49,930 --> 00:37:57,940
okay there are some stability issues

656
00:37:56,160 --> 00:38:01,270
when I do the test

657
00:37:57,940 --> 00:38:05,020
I'm near the Wi-Fi angle that it's like

658
00:38:01,270 --> 00:38:07,300
this one and the Scotties of software to

659
00:38:05,020 --> 00:38:08,320
send out the payload payload over here

660
00:38:07,300 --> 00:38:10,840
mother

661
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:15,730
when I do the test as a factor Newton it

662
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:18,180
is very high almost 90 percent of

663
00:38:15,730 --> 00:38:22,240
predator arm also mustn't make our

664
00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:25,509
equation imitation very unstable and

665
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:28,660
well crush every time we have yeah

666
00:38:25,510 --> 00:38:32,680
unable to complete sort of ho-ho exploit

667
00:38:28,660 --> 00:38:34,750
him you can want a change in okay well

668
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:37,359
the reason why do them factor is the

669
00:38:34,750 --> 00:38:42,810
power contracts for me finally I have a

670
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:46,570
fond of Julian I have a Google foo with

671
00:38:42,810 --> 00:38:51,130
Jagan inside which he for the send and

672
00:38:46,570 --> 00:38:53,890
we see in practice of normally sure the

673
00:38:51,130 --> 00:38:55,900
pieces to could solve the problem

674
00:38:53,890 --> 00:38:59,980
highly encounter and offender factored

675
00:38:55,900 --> 00:39:03,400
correctly so how about we use the

676
00:38:59,980 --> 00:39:07,750
function last the pieces to illusion to

677
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:09,820
send all the packet okay you can focus a

678
00:39:07,750 --> 00:39:12,730
function in the firmware which is in the

679
00:39:09,820 --> 00:39:16,000
specified effective picture we want our

680
00:39:12,730 --> 00:39:19,360
picture to replace the content of the

681
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:22,270
package for a type of payload okay that

682
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:24,730
is the solution finally we are using the

683
00:39:22,270 --> 00:39:25,720
piece of tool to attack the teaser to

684
00:39:24,730 --> 00:39:29,110
excel

685
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:31,720
yeah we send out our payload using a

686
00:39:29,110 --> 00:39:37,180
beautiful and the title is appeal to as

687
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:40,149
many your after how we focus a function

688
00:39:37,180 --> 00:39:43,600
in the framework it's another conflict

689
00:39:40,150 --> 00:39:48,510
story actually we don't have a lot of

690
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:53,410
time to talk about it today okay okay

691
00:39:48,510 --> 00:39:57,010
finally we are here with even a peaceful

692
00:39:53,410 --> 00:39:58,089
into the Dublin and into modern and the

693
00:39:57,010 --> 00:39:59,750
Antonius O'Connell

694
00:39:58,090 --> 00:40:14,150
this is white

695
00:39:59,750 --> 00:40:31,750
ken okay let's watch the demo I don't

696
00:40:14,150 --> 00:40:31,750
know how to play the directory play it

697
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:44,900
okay can you see okay it's this explains

698
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:47,630
something people are caught this is the

699
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:50,869
piece of tool you can see well this is

700
00:40:47,630 --> 00:40:53,420
the attacker this is a form we have

701
00:40:50,869 --> 00:40:56,810
compromised we own and this is the

702
00:40:53,420 --> 00:41:00,770
target the Taman which is a to excel

703
00:40:56,810 --> 00:41:05,690
okay now we are going to send a packet

704
00:41:00,770 --> 00:41:09,589
we prepared prepare the tag on appeal -

705
00:41:05,690 --> 00:41:11,750
yeah you can see explore that we are 10

706
00:41:09,589 --> 00:41:18,980
or the package okay

707
00:41:11,750 --> 00:41:24,250
the first payload is 1/100 and of 43

708
00:41:18,980 --> 00:41:24,250
means okay that they all send a packet

709
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:33,400
the people who actually off with the 86

710
00:41:33,430 --> 00:41:40,399
you can see that the ethics is important

711
00:41:37,010 --> 00:41:43,940
and we are unable to use the team it is

712
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:48,290
different on the shell yeah

713
00:41:43,940 --> 00:41:53,420
we are in the here okay so the people -

714
00:41:48,290 --> 00:41:55,490
you're sending packets we can that the

715
00:41:53,420 --> 00:41:59,330
whole process neither about sweets

716
00:41:55,490 --> 00:42:05,118
whinnies probably don't think we have to

717
00:41:59,330 --> 00:42:07,700
wait let's speed up speed up okay okay

718
00:42:05,119 --> 00:42:10,099
the type is a lot of finishes as you can

719
00:42:07,700 --> 00:42:12,850
see the ethylene University reinforces

720
00:42:10,099 --> 00:42:17,190
yeah

721
00:42:12,850 --> 00:42:25,450
let's just speed up abolish three minis

722
00:42:17,190 --> 00:42:30,960
okay okay did you poison a gun at this

723
00:42:25,450 --> 00:42:30,960
time okay the checker see the real art

724
00:42:33,750 --> 00:42:37,320
just wait one minute

725
00:42:50,319 --> 00:42:54,819
okay you can see it's a Tennessee so we

726
00:42:52,989 --> 00:42:57,969
have fully controlled in the Nene of the

727
00:42:54,819 --> 00:43:05,709
colonel and the father so that I see you

728
00:42:57,969 --> 00:43:07,419
need to pay miss you okay mm-hmm we are

729
00:43:05,709 --> 00:43:09,729
still in the shell but we haven't

730
00:43:07,419 --> 00:43:12,368
control of inning for Cano okay now we

731
00:43:09,729 --> 00:43:17,589
can't be enter the D message three and

732
00:43:12,369 --> 00:43:27,869
harder the color method okay okay this

733
00:43:17,589 --> 00:43:27,869
is the demo okay

734
00:43:32,969 --> 00:43:40,650
future works the after not so mystery in

735
00:43:37,809 --> 00:43:45,269
Table nine so we just reverse engineer

736
00:43:40,650 --> 00:43:48,699
small part of the code a lot of the

737
00:43:45,269 --> 00:43:53,169
functions of the turbulent unknown and

738
00:43:48,699 --> 00:43:58,929
how to father mm and how to chances when

739
00:43:53,169 --> 00:44:02,009
you check in to see maybe this is a

740
00:43:58,929 --> 00:44:06,099
tenant in report the first issue and

741
00:44:02,009 --> 00:44:09,880
February the 14th and coke on the Google

742
00:44:06,099 --> 00:44:13,329
responds very quickly not this issue

743
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:18,729
have already been fixed in the author's

744
00:44:13,329 --> 00:44:24,869
creative region okay and this is out

745
00:44:18,729 --> 00:44:28,118
world you just remember this this figure

746
00:44:24,869 --> 00:44:30,909
we front a belong to modern and the

747
00:44:28,119 --> 00:44:32,819
traditional and also we talk about how

748
00:44:30,909 --> 00:44:36,279
to handle and Pete it's in the turbulent

749
00:44:32,819 --> 00:44:40,150
okay you remember the data pointer the

750
00:44:36,279 --> 00:44:42,130
data pointer we are using also we know

751
00:44:40,150 --> 00:44:46,809
how to depart at the best and if you

752
00:44:42,130 --> 00:44:51,900
want to future research you can use the

753
00:44:46,809 --> 00:44:51,900
debugger okay hey that's all thank you

754
00:44:53,050 --> 00:44:57,089
[Applause]
