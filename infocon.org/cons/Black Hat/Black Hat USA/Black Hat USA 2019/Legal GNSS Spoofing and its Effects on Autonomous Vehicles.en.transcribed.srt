00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:09,360
narcissist GNSS spoofing and its effects

3
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:13,080
on autonomous vehicles breakers GHI with

00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:15,088
Victor Murray before we begin stop by

5
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:17,400

00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:39,420
us with join us for the pony Awards in

10
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:42,989
lagoon GA China at 1830 our 6:30 if

11
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:44,520
you're an American and thanks for

12
00:00:42,989 --> 00:00:46,199
putting your phone on vibrate it makes

13
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:48,239
us easier for the rest of us to ignore

14
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:54,500
the ringing while we while you wait for

15
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:54,500
your voicemail to pick it up so Victor

16
00:00:55,489 --> 00:00:59,750
hello everybody I'm so excited to be

17
00:00:57,809 --> 00:01:01,828
here

18
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:03,600
happy to tell you about some of the work

19
00:01:01,829 --> 00:01:07,070
that we've done global navigation

20
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:08,970
satellite systems these are

21
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:10,889
constellations of satellites that orbit

22
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:13,320
the earth broadcast a signal down and

23
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:15,420
our receivers or our phones are able to

24
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:20,339
calculate their location within a

25
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:22,229
certain error and this is used for all

26
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:24,210
kinds of things

27
00:01:22,229 --> 00:01:27,750
I took an uber from the airport to get

28
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:30,030
to Mandalay Bay it uses GNSS it's also

29
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:31,979
used for things like time stamping stock

30
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:35,040
trades so they know exactly when a stock

31
00:01:31,979 --> 00:01:38,070
train went through it's also used to set

32
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:40,500
the frequency of power lines one of the

33
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:42,960
issues with GNSS is it lacks integrity

34
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:49,049
mechanisms this means that all of our

35
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:51,258
receivers are susceptible to spoofing in

36
00:01:49,049 --> 00:01:53,759
addition to lacking integrity mechanisms

37
00:01:51,259 --> 00:01:56,040
Genesis is also transmitted at a very

38
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:57,810
low power so the PI actual power

39
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:59,759
received by your receiver is gonna vary

40
00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:02,640
depending on the altitude the atmosphere

41
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:04,409
of things like that but typically for

42
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:07,680
GPS the power that's received is between

43
00:02:04,409 --> 00:02:09,330
minus 120 DB M minus 1 30 DBM my

44
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:11,069
software-defined radio that sits on the

45
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:13,170
bench very low power is able to

46
00:02:11,068 --> 00:02:16,290
broadcast at plus 15

47
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:18,569
that's at least a delta of 135 DBM

48
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:20,069
it's huge difference very easy to

49
00:02:18,569 --> 00:02:21,690
overpower the signal that comes from the

50
00:02:20,069 --> 00:02:23,989
skies the signal that your receiver sees

51
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:26,780
is actually below the noise floor

52
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:29,550
they're also susceptible to interference

53
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:31,950
so things if the signals reflected off

54
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:34,650
of a building or a mountain it can

55
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:36,390
affect the localization estimate if you

56
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:38,910
drive under or through a tunnel or under

57
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:40,290
an underpass it can block out some of

58
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:42,560
the satellites or it can block them out

59
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:45,799
altogether similar effects with weather

60
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:48,030
so how could systems respond to spoofing

61
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:49,500
there's been a lot of good work in this

62
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:51,450
area by a whole lot of people but I'm

63
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:52,980
gonna highlight a couple here

64
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:54,958
dr. Todd Humphries he's from the

65
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:57,420
University of Texas at Austin his has

66
00:02:54,959 --> 00:03:00,510
had several publications that I've

67
00:02:57,420 --> 00:03:04,649
enjoyed reading and this is just one

68
00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:07,880
example video from YouTube of them doing

69
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:10,019
a live over-the-air spoofing of a drone

70
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:12,329
so what happens is the drone goes up

71
00:03:10,019 --> 00:03:14,760
it's flying on its own they spoof the

72
00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:16,260
GNSS signal they get it to latch on to

73
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:18,268
it as soon as it latches on to the

74
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:20,820
signal they've run the altitude through

75
00:03:18,269 --> 00:03:27,420
the roof the vehicle responds by coming

76
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:29,250
down Team Unicorn did a great

77
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:32,399
presentation at DEFCON on their low-cost

78
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:34,440
GPS simulator all they needed was a $400

79
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:36,570
software-defined radio and a laptop and

80
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:39,780
they were able to spoof GPS over-the-air

81
00:03:36,570 --> 00:03:43,440
or Genesis one of the cool things that

82
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:46,200
they did was exploitation of geofencing

83
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:47,430
so the drones today come with

84
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:49,500
pre-programmed areas that they're not

85
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:51,810
supposed to fly such as military bases

86
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:54,930
things like that so what they did was

87
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:56,220
broadcast a signal making it think that

88
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:57,570
they were in one of these spaces they're

89
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:59,480
not supposed to be and causing the

90
00:03:57,570 --> 00:04:02,340
drones to come down out pretty neat

91
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:05,190
another interesting case is the Iran

92
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:07,980
hack so Iran claims this is back in 2011

93
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:10,410
Iran claims to have hacked the Genesis

94
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:13,768
for an rq-170 drone causing it to come

95
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:14,970
down there's a whole lot of things that

96
00:04:13,769 --> 00:04:16,470
would have had to have been set up in a

97
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:18,839
very specific way for that to have

98
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:20,280
happened it's certainly possible I don't

99
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:21,149
know if it's true or not I'm going to

100
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:25,500
tell you a little bit about my

101
00:04:21,149 --> 00:04:26,419
experience with drones and it in in in

102
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:28,640
my experience

103
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:29,960
it's it's just as possible that they

104
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:33,530
just jam the signal and it could have

105
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:35,000
had a similar similar effect so what can

106
00:04:33,530 --> 00:04:40,219
happen if systems aren't tested for

107
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:42,560
Genesis issues I was hired at my current

108
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:45,830
company in 2002 to work on drones as a

109
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:47,750
student I built our autopilot system and

110
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:51,229
ground control station this picture the

111
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:53,210
one on the left is me in 2006 and on the

112
00:04:51,230 --> 00:04:56,300
Wrights angel Rivera we were project

113
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:58,940
managers for our flight control system

114
00:04:56,300 --> 00:05:02,090
part of my duties was to oversee field

115
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:03,320
operations and we had around 50 drones

116
00:05:02,090 --> 00:05:05,000
that had been built and we're flying

117
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:08,719
regular so we had a whole lot of flight

118
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:11,030
hours accumulating so when when the

119
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:12,140
customer would have a problem the the

120
00:05:11,030 --> 00:05:13,489
company that owned the drone when they

121
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:15,229
had a problem they would call me they'd

122
00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:16,700
send me the data I would look at it and

123
00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:20,060
do a root cause analysis try to identify

124
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:21,979
what what caused this issue simple

125
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:23,600
things from the kinds of issues that

126
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:27,140
they would call me before were just a

127
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:28,550
warning popping up or they should deploy

128
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:31,760
these there's a small chute in this

129
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:33,860
drone and ended the mission early or in

130
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:37,880
a couple of cases the the drone was went

131
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:39,830
down and crashed or or was lost so when

132
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:42,230
I was looking at these problems there

133
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:45,169
were two primary causes the first was

134
00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:47,390
mechanical issues so this is a wire came

135
00:05:45,170 --> 00:05:49,430
loose or an antenna came loose or a

136
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:52,010
motor stopped working those kinds of

137
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:54,590
things the second most common issue is

138
00:05:52,010 --> 00:05:57,260
with sensors we saw issues with all

139
00:05:54,590 --> 00:06:01,429
kinds of sensors but the most common was

140
00:05:57,260 --> 00:06:04,780
GNSS there were instances where the GNSS

141
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:08,780
would move to the right by 200 meters or

142
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:10,309
the altitude would jump by 50 meters or

143
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:12,559
we would lose it it would drop out for

144
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:14,720
three or four minutes or we would lose

145
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:16,520
GNSS permanently the system always

146
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:19,490
responded in a little different manner

147
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:21,770
sometimes appropriately sometimes not

148
00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:25,220
sometimes the system would it would it

149
00:06:21,770 --> 00:06:26,390
would fly low like it lost Eunice's to a

150
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:28,340
flight a little higher to try to get a

151
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:30,530
better signal receive that signal and

152
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:34,460
then go on its mission but sometimes we

153
00:06:30,530 --> 00:06:36,409
lost the aircraft so these corner cases

154
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:38,810
are kind of key to improving the

155
00:06:36,410 --> 00:06:39,290
reliability of autonomous vehicles and

156
00:06:38,810 --> 00:06:41,420
so

157
00:06:39,290 --> 00:06:43,400
what we thought was let's build a system

158
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:44,690
that allows us to test these corner

159
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:46,820
cases these things that you're gonna

160
00:06:44,690 --> 00:06:49,100
have to go out and drive your car or fly

161
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:50,810
your drone for for you know thousands

162
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:52,670
and thousands of hours to see just once

163
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:56,480
but be able to repeat it over and over

164
00:06:52,670 --> 00:06:59,150
again so this concept in mind we applied

165
00:06:56,480 --> 00:07:00,740
for and receive internal research and

166
00:06:59,150 --> 00:07:02,330
development funding from our company all

167
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:07,970
the results that you're gonna see we're

168
00:07:02,330 --> 00:07:09,289
100% funded by our company so I'm going

169
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:09,830
to tell you about the the smoothing

170
00:07:09,290 --> 00:07:10,820
system

171
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:12,859
it's got hardware and software

172
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:14,210
components I'm going to tell you about

173
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:17,440
our autonomous vehicle fleet and

174
00:07:14,210 --> 00:07:19,400
specifically the vehicle that was tested

175
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:21,110
then I'm gonna highlight some of our

176
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:22,969
testing results we did a whole whole lot

177
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:24,230
of testing but I've got three key ones

178
00:07:22,970 --> 00:07:26,690
that we're gonna highlight here today

179
00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:28,760
position translation velocity

180
00:07:26,690 --> 00:07:31,190
manipulation and halting the Jeana

181
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:37,640
system and then I'm gonna provide our

182
00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:39,500
recommendations and takeaways we have an

183
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:41,030
entire department that focuses on

184
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:44,030
research and development of autonomous

185
00:07:41,030 --> 00:07:45,830
vehicles all the vehicles shown on the

186
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:47,780
screen here are owned by my company and

187
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:51,650
they have all been outfitted with our

188
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:53,989
own autonomy kits so the Lincoln MKZ in

189
00:07:51,650 --> 00:07:55,789
the upper right would was also outfitted

190
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:58,340
with an autonomy kit and it's what we

191
00:07:55,790 --> 00:08:00,020
use for all of our testing all of the

192
00:07:58,340 --> 00:08:02,299
testing it was configured to drive by

193
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:04,520
GNSS Waypoint for the purpose of these

194
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:06,260
tests all the attacks that we're gonna

195
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:09,409
show were performed remotely and in

196
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:12,289
real-time so the first word in my title

197
00:08:09,410 --> 00:08:15,710
is legal haven't talked at all about yet

198
00:08:12,290 --> 00:08:18,290
so to be legal how do we comply let's

199
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:20,989
start with what's illegal spoofing RF

200
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:23,030
signals not limited to GNSS any type of

201
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:24,950
RF signal is illegal in the United

202
00:08:23,030 --> 00:08:30,049
States further Communications Act of

203
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:31,550
1934 so what's legal well the FCC has a

204
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:33,740
couple of routes that you can take to

205
00:08:31,550 --> 00:08:36,200
get special permission you can either

206
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:38,750
get an experimental license or you can

207
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:40,610
get a waiver of the FCC's rules for all

208
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:42,500
of our testing we did not use either of

209
00:08:40,610 --> 00:08:46,040
those we did not get special permission

210
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:48,830
from the FCC the next two items we did

211
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:50,480
use your a louder a broadcast inside of

212
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:51,760
a fully enclosed Faraday cage and the

213
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:55,000
key word and the regulation

214
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:57,399
fully enclosed you're also allowed to

215
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,779
broadcast on the isn bands your 900

216
00:08:57,399 --> 00:09:01,089
megahertz to point four or five point

217
00:08:58,779 --> 00:09:04,329
eight gigahertz as long as you keep the

218
00:09:01,089 --> 00:09:05,740
power below one watt so the system that

219
00:09:04,329 --> 00:09:09,279
we use throughout all this testing is

220
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:11,829
100% legal this is the hardware outline

221
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:14,470
we start by putting our own RTK

222
00:09:11,829 --> 00:09:15,910
high-precision GNSS receiver on top of

223
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:18,130
the receiver that we want to spoof that

224
00:09:15,910 --> 00:09:20,709
way we know it's actual position in real

225
00:09:18,130 --> 00:09:22,449
time that signals that that sensor sends

226
00:09:20,709 --> 00:09:24,160
nemeth sentences to the computer and the

227
00:09:22,449 --> 00:09:27,760
computer is able to manipulate those or

228
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:29,380
pass them through and modify that

229
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:31,540
modification that manipulation is

230
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:34,600
controlled remotely over either a Wi-Fi

231
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:36,099
or cellular link the modified or

232
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:38,050
unmodified signal is then sent to the

233
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:39,610
software-defined radio which generates

234
00:09:38,050 --> 00:09:41,769
the analog signal that's sent to the

235
00:09:39,610 --> 00:09:43,240
receiver under test and the way we send

236
00:09:41,769 --> 00:09:45,339
it to the receiver under test we did two

237
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:47,860
different methods one was inside the

238
00:09:45,339 --> 00:09:49,930
fully enclosed Faraday cage and this is

239
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:52,029
we put the actual antennas inside of a

240
00:09:49,930 --> 00:09:53,888
box we'll put some RF dampening material

241
00:09:52,029 --> 00:09:54,850
in there and would broadcast its

242
00:09:53,889 --> 00:09:57,699
over-the-air but it's completely

243
00:09:54,850 --> 00:10:01,389
contained and second was just connecting

244
00:09:57,699 --> 00:10:02,529
directly in line with the antenna all of

245
00:10:01,389 --> 00:10:05,050
the testing results that I'm going to

246
00:10:02,529 --> 00:10:08,230
show use that approach use this hardware

247
00:10:05,050 --> 00:10:11,800
outline we also demonstrated the ability

248
00:10:08,230 --> 00:10:14,050
to use frequency translation with that

249
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:15,519
what that did was we added two boxes to

250
00:10:14,050 --> 00:10:17,019
this block diagram one at the output of

251
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:19,540
the software-defined radio and one on

252
00:10:17,019 --> 00:10:21,430
the receiver under test we focused on

253
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:22,870
GPS l1 band which has a carrier

254
00:10:21,430 --> 00:10:25,750
frequency of one point five seven five

255
00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:28,930
gigahertz we didn't mix that with a 660

256
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:31,300
megahertz signal filter amplify and it

257
00:10:28,930 --> 00:10:33,670
shifts it to the ninth 915 Center

258
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:35,529
frequency we send that signal

259
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:38,260
over-the-air this is in the unlicensed

260
00:10:35,529 --> 00:10:39,850
panel we then have our own box on the

261
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:42,069
other side that receives that that

262
00:10:39,850 --> 00:10:44,649
signal shifts if it does it does the

263
00:10:42,069 --> 00:10:46,420
opposite again mixes it was 660 slightly

264
00:10:44,649 --> 00:10:48,399
different filtering and amplification

265
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:50,860
and sends that signal to the receiver

266
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:52,060
under test and it worked and the benefit

267
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:53,829
of this was going to be we could take a

268
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:56,170
lot of equipment off a vehicle and have

269
00:10:53,829 --> 00:10:57,430
a lighter package the problem was when

270
00:10:56,170 --> 00:11:00,010
we took it out to the field we had

271
00:10:57,430 --> 00:11:02,739
severe range limitations we could only

272
00:11:00,010 --> 00:11:04,850
broadcast this method it injects a lot

273
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:06,500
of noise into the signal and when we

274
00:11:04,850 --> 00:11:08,630
did this we could only broadcast staying

275
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:10,550
under the one wah up to about 200 meters

276
00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:14,720
and so all the results that you're gonna

277
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:16,880
see use the Wi-Fi or cellular link this

278
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:18,170
is our controlling software the software

279
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:20,779
on the right is ours it's written with

280
00:11:18,170 --> 00:11:22,160
Python scripts the concentric circles

281
00:11:20,779 --> 00:11:23,209
you're allowed to click anywhere the

282
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:25,279
operator will click anywhere on that

283
00:11:23,209 --> 00:11:27,229
screen and instantly insert an offset

284
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:29,120
that offsets scalable it can be a

285
00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:31,940
thousand meters hundred thousand meters

286
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:33,470
there can be one meter at the bottom

287
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:35,389
there's a bunch of buttons those are our

288
00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:37,430
TAC scripts that do the other the other

289
00:11:35,389 --> 00:11:40,370
manipulations missing with velocity or

290
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:41,569
timing or those kinds of things the

291
00:11:40,370 --> 00:11:44,269
software to the right is commercial

292
00:11:41,569 --> 00:11:46,219
off-the-shelf its sky del s DX we use

293
00:11:44,269 --> 00:11:48,050
that software to take a latitude long

294
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:49,490
longitude altitude position and

295
00:11:48,050 --> 00:11:53,300
translate it to the signal that goes to

296
00:11:49,490 --> 00:11:59,240
the software to find radio all right the

297
00:11:53,300 --> 00:12:00,859
fun part the attacks alright all the

298
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:02,449
videos that I'm going to show the car

299
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:07,819
first drives the path that it's planned

300
00:12:02,449 --> 00:12:09,740
to drive for the offset attack we were

301
00:12:07,819 --> 00:12:12,259
able to manipulate the vehicles position

302
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:14,509
up to 10 meters at a time for this demo

303
00:12:12,259 --> 00:12:16,370
we offset at 4 meters to the right and

304
00:12:14,509 --> 00:12:21,680
you can see the vehicle responds by

305
00:12:16,370 --> 00:12:22,970
moving four meters to the left we didn't

306
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:24,829
remove it it comes right back to the

307
00:12:22,970 --> 00:12:27,050
right now understand the signal that the

308
00:12:24,829 --> 00:12:28,519
car is receiving it's driving straight

309
00:12:27,050 --> 00:12:30,589
on its path that it's supposed to and

310
00:12:28,519 --> 00:12:33,019
then it jumps over and it immediately

311
00:12:30,589 --> 00:12:34,870
corrects so if you looked at the at the

312
00:12:33,019 --> 00:12:37,459
path that it's growing it sits down the

313
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:40,069
it's straight down the road except for

314
00:12:37,459 --> 00:12:42,109
when we inject those manipulations now

315
00:12:40,069 --> 00:12:43,519
we can we can modify this multiple times

316
00:12:42,110 --> 00:12:45,439
we can move it 4 meters to the right

317
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:48,079
then 4 meters to the right that 4 meters

318
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:51,019
to the right if we moved more than 10

319
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:53,120
the receiver lost fix and understand

320
00:12:51,019 --> 00:12:55,759
this car is relying on the GNSS receiver

321
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:57,920
to guide itself so if it loses the

322
00:12:55,759 --> 00:12:59,329
signal for more than more than a second

323
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:01,610
or so it kicks out and asked the

324
00:12:59,329 --> 00:13:04,008
operator to take over which is which so

325
00:13:01,610 --> 00:13:05,180
for us that killed the test we got to

326
00:13:04,009 --> 00:13:09,529
that point now where might as well just

327
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:10,790
jam the signal right all right besides

328
00:13:09,529 --> 00:13:12,560
moving it left and right we could also

329
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:14,240
move it forwards or backwards and cause

330
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:16,420
the vehicle to either turn early or turn

331
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:16,420
late

332
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:21,839
alright next we dork with the velocity

333
00:13:18,869 --> 00:13:25,759
in this demo the car comes up it makes a

334
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:25,759
right-hand turn and it comes to a stop

335
00:13:28,279 --> 00:13:32,939
for the attack as the car is coming

336
00:13:30,839 --> 00:13:34,519
towards us right before it starts to

337
00:13:32,939 --> 00:13:37,079
make the turn we increase the velocity

338
00:13:34,519 --> 00:13:41,279
so the car it's GNSS signal keeps

339
00:13:37,079 --> 00:13:42,719
driving straight past the camera now the

340
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:44,459
car still turns because that's what it's

341
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:47,069
control system will do but it doesn't

342
00:13:44,459 --> 00:13:48,660
see the turning and it's feedback so it

343
00:13:47,069 --> 00:13:55,290
turns harder it drives itself off the

344
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:56,819
road so had we modified it earlier we

345
00:13:55,290 --> 00:13:58,290
for this demo we modified it right

346
00:13:56,819 --> 00:13:59,910
before the turn and we modified it

347
00:13:58,290 --> 00:14:01,290
earlier it would have made a similar

348
00:13:59,910 --> 00:14:04,279
turn but we could have made it turn

349
00:14:01,290 --> 00:14:06,299
earlier turn late so if we sped it up

350
00:14:04,279 --> 00:14:07,619
the car would have turned before the

351
00:14:06,299 --> 00:14:11,819
turn oh we slowed it down it would have

352
00:14:07,619 --> 00:14:14,429
turned after the turn when it's driving

353
00:14:11,819 --> 00:14:16,559
straight and we changed the velocity it

354
00:14:14,429 --> 00:14:17,970
had no immediate impact and the reason

355
00:14:16,559 --> 00:14:20,459
is because the car governed its speed

356
00:14:17,970 --> 00:14:22,169
based on wheel speed not GNSS velocity

357
00:14:20,459 --> 00:14:24,839
which makes a lot of sense we the wheel

358
00:14:22,169 --> 00:14:32,160
speed is super constant where the GNSS

359
00:14:24,839 --> 00:14:33,749
velocity is a little more squirrely all

360
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:35,129
right now the halt for this scenario the

361
00:14:33,749 --> 00:14:39,169
car drives straight through the

362
00:14:35,129 --> 00:14:39,169
intersection and past the camera

363
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:49,300
okay now for the attack as it's coming

364
00:14:47,410 --> 00:14:52,780
up to the intersection we quickly

365
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:55,300
stopped the GNSS signal the car swerves

366
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:56,949
right then it swerves left so what

367
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:58,270
actually happens is during that slowdown

368
00:14:56,950 --> 00:15:00,430
period of slowdown periods about two

369
00:14:58,270 --> 00:15:02,620
seconds it goes from about 25 miles per

370
00:15:00,430 --> 00:15:04,270
hour down to zero and when it's doing

371
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:05,500
that over that - and this is the genus s

372
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:07,240
speed not the vehicle speed when it's

373
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:09,250
when it's making that transition the

374
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:11,560
vehicle has no notable noticeable effect

375
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:13,540
it keeps driving straight but as soon as

376
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:17,319
it stopped the control system becomes

377
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:19,209
unstable again the the cars driving and

378
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:21,880
it has no feedback it doesn't know which

379
00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:24,460
way to turn so we did a lot of other

380
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:26,410
testing and we had similar results if we

381
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:28,660
when we did one of our timing attacks

382
00:15:26,410 --> 00:15:30,130
where we pass through the real GNSS

383
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:34,300
signal but we delayed it by a couple

384
00:15:30,130 --> 00:15:35,920
seconds so we'll do in doing that the

385
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:39,719
car set the control system again became

386
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:39,719
instead stable and had similar results

387
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:44,620
so these are our recommendations to

388
00:15:42,310 --> 00:15:47,739
enhance safety critical systems now I'm

389
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:49,960
not making these recommendations for for

390
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:51,340
your navigation system on your car if

391
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:53,050
you get if you're driving down the road

392
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:56,500
and your navigation system gets spoofed

393
00:15:53,050 --> 00:15:57,819
what happens it's annoying you might be

394
00:15:56,500 --> 00:16:01,060
late you might not be able to find your

395
00:15:57,820 --> 00:16:02,410
wherever you're going - but you're okay

396
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:03,729
there there's no harm that comes to you

397
00:16:02,410 --> 00:16:06,400
there's no harm that comes to your car

398
00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:07,660
so these recommendations are for systems

399
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:09,490
that are making safety critical

400
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:14,530
decisions that can have the ability to

401
00:16:09,490 --> 00:16:16,240
either harm a person or an asset so

402
00:16:14,530 --> 00:16:17,709
first recommendation is easiest that's

403
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:19,570
to use multiple constellations most

404
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:21,190
receivers already do this it's just good

405
00:16:19,570 --> 00:16:23,770
practice if you take it a step further

406
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:24,970
you can also compare the localization

407
00:16:23,770 --> 00:16:26,890
estimate between the different

408
00:16:24,970 --> 00:16:29,560
constellations with each other and look

409
00:16:26,890 --> 00:16:31,569
for a divergence the downside is also

410
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:34,119
the easiest to overcome or able to spoof

411
00:16:31,570 --> 00:16:36,430
most multiple constellations as our most

412
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:38,770
security researchers that work in genus

413
00:16:36,430 --> 00:16:41,079
s alright next

414
00:16:38,770 --> 00:16:43,569
don't rely solely on GNSS for safety

415
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:45,520
critical systems all right it's not it's

416
00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:47,800
not if but when they will be spoof the

417
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:50,170
can be spoof the cost of these systems

418
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:53,380
is dropping every day you can't rely

419
00:16:50,170 --> 00:16:54,819
solely on it our third is to monitor the

420
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:56,620
signal there's all kinds of data that

421
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:59,110
comes from it you get position velocity

422
00:16:56,620 --> 00:17:00,820
acceleration signal noise ratio

423
00:16:59,110 --> 00:17:02,500
levels all these things they can all be

424
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:04,209
characterized and monitored if your

425
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:07,480
civvie annoys ratio for a satellite

426
00:17:04,209 --> 00:17:08,860
jumps from 35 up to 55 that might

427
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:11,730
indicate a spoofing event and your

428
00:17:08,859 --> 00:17:14,740
system should respond accordingly

429
00:17:11,730 --> 00:17:16,390
specific to autonomous vehicles there's

430
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:18,370
a number of different localization

431
00:17:16,390 --> 00:17:20,260
systems there's vision based source

432
00:17:18,369 --> 00:17:22,839
lidar based combinations thereof and

433
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:24,459
there's GNSS these systems have got to

434
00:17:22,839 --> 00:17:27,579
be used together and compared to each

435
00:17:24,459 --> 00:17:29,620
other we've got to use those to identify

436
00:17:27,579 --> 00:17:31,000
divergence in the estimates and the

437
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:34,510
system needs to be able to respond when

438
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:36,070
that occurs and finally we need to test

439
00:17:34,510 --> 00:17:38,919
these systems to make sure when these

440
00:17:36,070 --> 00:17:40,809
corner cases come up if the GPS jumps or

441
00:17:38,919 --> 00:17:43,330
or if it's spoofed and somebody's you

442
00:17:40,809 --> 00:17:44,980
know rather as we saw in the demo runs

443
00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:47,129
the runs the altitude through the route

444
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:50,049
for a drone how's the system respond and

445
00:17:47,130 --> 00:17:51,400
in my experience we did we tried to do

446
00:17:50,049 --> 00:17:52,480
all this we had a simulator tried to

447
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:54,100
make sure the software would do all

448
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:55,600
these things but we were when we went

449
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:57,850
out in the field the system didn't

450
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:59,260
always respond as we expect it and so

451
00:17:57,850 --> 00:18:04,178
these things need to be tested on the

452
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:06,850
final systems longer-term we need to add

453
00:18:04,179 --> 00:18:08,799
integrity verification methods to the

454
00:18:06,850 --> 00:18:09,939
GNSS satellites and this applies to all

455
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:13,418
the public versions

456
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:15,190
GPS GLONASS Baidu Galileo they all need

457
00:18:13,419 --> 00:18:17,350
to add integrity verification mechanisms

458
00:18:15,190 --> 00:18:19,120
either digital signatures public private

459
00:18:17,350 --> 00:18:20,980
keys some other form of encryption some

460
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:22,750
way to know that the signal that your

461
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:24,730
receiver receives came from the

462
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:30,010
satellites in the sky not from an SDR

463
00:18:24,730 --> 00:18:30,520
sitting on the side of the road all

464
00:18:30,010 --> 00:18:32,440
right

465
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:34,090
key takeaways all right we we

466
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:36,880
demonstrated as you saw in all the

467
00:18:34,090 --> 00:18:39,399
videos that you can legally spoof GNSS

468
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:41,530
in a field environment we did it using a

469
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:45,309
fully enclosed Faraday cage and the is M

470
00:18:41,530 --> 00:18:46,629
broadcast one of the key things so we

471
00:18:45,309 --> 00:18:47,830
were able to do a lot of cool stuff we

472
00:18:46,630 --> 00:18:50,010
could move the vehicle right move it

473
00:18:47,830 --> 00:18:52,570
left we could speed it up slow it down

474
00:18:50,010 --> 00:18:56,049
delay the timing to it cause the control

475
00:18:52,570 --> 00:18:58,899
system become unstable but that's it

476
00:18:56,049 --> 00:19:00,340
there were severe limitations when we

477
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:01,510
started this I had thought well hey

478
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:03,699
maybe we'll be able to have the car

479
00:19:01,510 --> 00:19:05,770
think it's it's driving down the freeway

480
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:08,230
while it's parked in the parking lot it

481
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:12,040
just wasn't the case and that's because

482
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:12,550
the car uses other sensors so Genesis

483
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:14,830
isn't

484
00:19:12,550 --> 00:19:16,060
raising sensor and I and I I'm an

485
00:19:14,830 --> 00:19:17,530
optimist I think it should be used for

486
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:19,659
autonomous vehicles and it's I'm not

487
00:19:17,530 --> 00:19:20,830
advocating otherwise but we need to be

488
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:24,490
careful we need to do it in the right

489
00:19:20,830 --> 00:19:26,290
way so as I said on the last night

490
00:19:24,490 --> 00:19:28,570
specific for autonomous vehicles we've

491
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:30,879
got to combine the genus s with other

492
00:19:28,570 --> 00:19:33,929
localization estimates and make sure the

493
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:33,930
vehicles respond accordingly

494
00:19:34,350 --> 00:19:39,520
so I had a lot of help on this project

495
00:19:36,490 --> 00:19:42,640
bin Abbott co-created the idea for this

496
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:44,980
with me and help me get the internal

497
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:47,500
funding Vinland al wrote most of the

498
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:50,350
software and supported all the tests

499
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:53,260
that you saw Jimmy Lee did our RF design

500
00:19:50,350 --> 00:19:54,850
he designed our Faraday cage provided

501
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:57,879
support when we brain it annoys issues

502
00:19:54,850 --> 00:19:59,649
and things like that and mat Brees who

503
00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:03,430
didn't make my slide but he helped with

504
00:19:59,650 --> 00:20:05,620
the autonomous vehicle support and

505
00:20:03,430 --> 00:20:15,460
that's my presentation thank you guys so

506
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:17,350
much for coming out and if there any

507
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:18,640
questions you look welcome to come and

508
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:20,379
ask I'm gonna warn people ahead of time

509
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:22,860
I do not hear very well so please try to

510
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:22,860
speak clearly

511
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:36,749
no questions all right

512
00:20:33,630 --> 00:20:36,749
[Applause]

513
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:42,970
oh there's one you want to go up to the

514
00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:48,899
microphone you want to go up there it

515
00:20:42,970 --> 00:20:48,900
said they said everyone can hear hello

516
00:20:51,610 --> 00:20:55,280
yeah it was one I was wondering if you

517
00:20:53,809 --> 00:20:58,059
had given any thought to what kind of

518
00:20:55,280 --> 00:21:01,549
the arms way his race would look like as

519
00:20:58,059 --> 00:21:03,470
red teams would inject spoofing and

520
00:21:01,549 --> 00:21:05,000
people would try to harden and then what

521
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:09,830
that might look like is that kind of

522
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:12,640
feedback loop starts up understand I I'm

523
00:21:09,830 --> 00:21:15,649
gonna shy away from responding to a

524
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:17,720
nation-state style attacks I don't so it

525
00:21:15,650 --> 00:21:19,370
so most of my recommendations and you

526
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:21,440
know we're using for nation state there

527
00:21:19,370 --> 00:21:23,719
are military versions of GNSS which

528
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:25,909
should be used for their systems so all

529
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:30,080
of these comments are geared towards

530
00:21:25,909 --> 00:21:31,280
public versions keep you to discuss a

531
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:32,689
little bit how you implemented the

532
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:36,500
Faraday cage in the open field

533
00:21:32,690 --> 00:21:39,020
sure so the the Faraday cage we bought

534
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:41,450
it's a cast aluminum box very small

535
00:21:39,020 --> 00:21:42,918
inside of there we put some RF absorbing

536
00:21:41,450 --> 00:21:45,740
material this is which makes it very

537
00:21:42,919 --> 00:21:47,809
heavy it says this is the the box has

538
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:50,600
some significant weight to it and inside

539
00:21:47,809 --> 00:21:52,908
there we put the receiving antenna and

540
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:55,100
we also put our spoofing antenna so

541
00:21:52,909 --> 00:21:56,570
these they're the antenna if you were

542
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:58,299
doing spoofing you take those two

543
00:21:56,570 --> 00:22:00,980
outside it's gonna have a similar effect

544
00:21:58,299 --> 00:22:02,210
but we just put both of them inside of a

545
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:05,210
box so that the signal that's being

546
00:22:02,210 --> 00:22:06,980
broadcast is contained so you put the

547
00:22:05,210 --> 00:22:09,830
broadcast antenna on the vehicle as well

548
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:12,289
next the brachot the broadcasting

549
00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:18,889
antenna is also inside the cage dr. you

550
00:22:12,289 --> 00:22:21,350
got it yes just threw out my question so

551
00:22:18,890 --> 00:22:24,220
with with like the spoofing of the gns

552
00:22:21,350 --> 00:22:27,289
like do you think that there are like

553
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:29,780
what are some other different aspects

554
00:22:27,289 --> 00:22:31,280
you think besides genus as spoofing that

555
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:33,408
could affect the autonomous vehicles

556
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:34,879
I think they could what like different

557
00:22:33,409 --> 00:22:36,950
different attacks that could could

558
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:38,600
affect them besides GNSS spoofing well

559
00:22:36,950 --> 00:22:40,700
there's there's a lot of interesting

560
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:42,260
work out there on sensor spoofing in

561
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:44,179
general and it's not limited to just

562
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:46,070
Genesis that's what this presentation

563
00:22:44,179 --> 00:22:47,510
focused on but it's a problem for most

564
00:22:46,070 --> 00:22:50,178
sensors especially those that get

565
00:22:47,510 --> 00:22:52,120
received attic people have demonstrated

566
00:22:50,179 --> 00:22:55,760
spoofing of cameras of lidar radar

567
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:57,649
ultrasonic they've all been spoofed part

568
00:22:55,760 --> 00:23:00,379
of my at least my my logic and thinking

569
00:22:57,650 --> 00:23:02,100
is that spoofing all of these in

570
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:04,260
coordination is

571
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:06,418
incredibly difficult if not impossible

572
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:08,789
with today's technology and so I

573
00:23:06,419 --> 00:23:10,440
advocate for we need to take we need to

574
00:23:08,789 --> 00:23:12,480
have all this sensor data and it needs

575
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:15,059
to be compared with each other to do

576
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:17,130
sanity checks in real time do you think

577
00:23:15,059 --> 00:23:18,720
it would be possible if somebody put

578
00:23:17,130 --> 00:23:20,460
together an attack specifically on

579
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:23,039
autonomous vehicle that affected not

580
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:26,730
only just the GNSS but also like other

581
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:29,490
sensors it's possible but a lot of the

582
00:23:26,730 --> 00:23:31,679
times and and you know and I've spend a

583
00:23:29,490 --> 00:23:33,419
lot of time working on this you can

584
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:35,429
characterize a lot of these attacks and

585
00:23:33,419 --> 00:23:37,520
to coordinate the characterization

586
00:23:35,429 --> 00:23:40,020
between different sensors simultaneously

587
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:41,760
in in my experience would be just

588
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:44,340
unbelievably difficult to do is it

589
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:46,679
possible yes and certainly if technology

590
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:48,658
gets better if you had now somebody has

591
00:23:46,679 --> 00:23:52,080
access to the data bus and you can do

592
00:23:48,659 --> 00:23:54,929
data bus injection and replay and maybe

593
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:56,250
those things become more likely a lot of

594
00:23:54,929 --> 00:24:02,370
our work has focused on the remote

595
00:23:56,250 --> 00:24:05,700
access to these things thank you oh we

596
00:24:02,370 --> 00:24:07,408
got one minute yeah just real quick you

597
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:09,299
mentioned at the close of your talk you

598
00:24:07,409 --> 00:24:11,340
mentioned two other describe if you

599
00:24:09,299 --> 00:24:12,809
could other localization methods could

600
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:16,168
you give us some examples of that please

601
00:24:12,809 --> 00:24:19,408
sure I so we have one that's vision

602
00:24:16,169 --> 00:24:20,669
based that points down at the ground and

603
00:24:19,409 --> 00:24:23,400
from the ground it's able to estimate

604
00:24:20,669 --> 00:24:26,520
the position that it's at there are

605
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:29,580
other ones I'm less familiar with but

606
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:31,650
you have way mo and you have the Chevy

607
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:33,570
Cruze those guys have their own versions

608
00:24:31,650 --> 00:24:36,030
I believe they're all camera based but

609
00:24:33,570 --> 00:24:42,030
I'm not sure way mo may integrate lidar

610
00:24:36,030 --> 00:24:45,840
as well lidar thank you so I've got two

611
00:24:42,030 --> 00:24:47,100
questions one do you think that Amazon

612
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:48,959
or any of the larger companies are

613
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:51,570
looking at mitigation techniques for

614
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:55,169
their drone delivery systems so say that

615
00:24:51,570 --> 00:24:57,270
again do you have you heard of any or no

616
00:24:55,169 --> 00:24:58,740
of any mitigation techniques at Amazon

617
00:24:57,270 --> 00:25:01,110
or any larger commercial companies are

618
00:24:58,740 --> 00:25:04,230
doing for free I do not I do not agree

619
00:25:01,110 --> 00:25:06,840
and then the second question have you

620
00:25:04,230 --> 00:25:09,270
and your peers or have you talked to

621
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:11,639
anybody about maybe looking at doing

622
00:25:09,270 --> 00:25:13,740
some similar testing against automated

623
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:15,530
landing systems takeoff systems for

624
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:19,400
commercial airliners or

625
00:25:15,530 --> 00:25:20,990
airplanes of larger sizes have not when

626
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:22,940
we were doing the research we talked

627
00:25:20,990 --> 00:25:24,410
about putting it on a larger drone at

628
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:26,030
which which would have more and and

629
00:25:24,410 --> 00:25:26,870
drones have different control systems so

630
00:25:26,030 --> 00:25:28,490
when we're talking about the ground

631
00:25:26,870 --> 00:25:30,860
vehicles they do have to use other

632
00:25:28,490 --> 00:25:33,350
localization methods simply because the

633
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:35,629
GNSS by itself isn't accurate enough but

634
00:25:33,350 --> 00:25:37,879
drones drones you can be can fly almost

635
00:25:35,630 --> 00:25:39,800
we have to have an IMU with it but a

636
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:41,600
drone with an eye on you can fly pretty

637
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:43,790
well so it would have different

638
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:46,030
responses than the vehicles that you saw

639
00:25:43,790 --> 00:25:46,030
here
