5
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:18,800
you're going to listen in on a

6
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:20,880
conversation amongst black hat review

7
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:22,400
board members you're going to hear us

8
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:25,279
talk about what we like what we've seen

9
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:27,439
our thoughts about the future

10
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:29,439
and it's going to be very conversational

11
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:31,119
so it's almost like you're listening

12
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:33,440
into a bunch of friends have a tough

13
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:36,079
talk about information security

14
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:38,719
and before we get started

15
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:40,480
i want to thank microsoft and i want to

16
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:43,040
thank mandana java hiri

17
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:45,200
for helping support black hat because

18
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:46,800
without the support of not only the

19
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,120
community but also industry sessions

20
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:50,800
like this wouldn't be possible so with

21
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:53,120
that i'd like to introduce mandana to

22
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:56,718
say a few words before we get started

23
00:00:57,039 --> 00:00:59,440
you use this microphone

24
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:01,600
all right thank you

25
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:04,400
by the way they did offer me some drinks

26
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:07,280
i just said no for now it's joking so

27
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:09,360
welcome everyone and hopefully you

28
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:12,799
enjoyed black hat so far i must admit

29
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:15,439
blackhead us and defcon right after that

30
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:18,479
they're usually my most favorite events

31
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:20,880
to attend i just recently

32
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,479
relocated from san francisco to

33
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:24,880
singapore so this is my first blackhead

34
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:27,600
asia and i'm very excited to be here

35
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,040
so you know

36
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,880
i know that everybody is talking about

37
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:33,520
pandemic and what we've gone through but

38
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:36,479
the reality is our security was really

39
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:38,799
challenged because of this pandemic

40
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:40,880
because of the expansion of the digital

41
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,399
state

42
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:44,560
and the acceleration of it due to the

43
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,720
pandemic as well as the evolution of the

44
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,159
threats of course

45
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:49,119
so

46
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:51,439
you know overnight or in a few days

47
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:53,920
personally professionally and of course

48
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:56,880
our beloved cyber security industry

49
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:00,159
really got impacted and our it and

50
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:02,399
security people they all of a sudden had

51
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:05,200
to really deal with all of their user

52
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:08,239
all the data all the devices all the

53
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:10,000
applications being us

54
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,599
outside of their organization all of a

55
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:14,000
sudden and they had to keep everything

56
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,959
secure compliant and of course keep all

57
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:19,599
the employees productive

58
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:21,680
so we did a research recently we do it

59
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,440
every six

60
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:26,480
months with the security leaders and the

61
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:29,680
research um just was about what are the

62
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:32,080
top of mind and challenges for the

63
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:34,319
for the ciso and security

64
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:36,640
specialists in this year

65
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:39,360
and the top five came as not really

66
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:42,239
surprising the first one was ransomware

67
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:44,160
and the risk of the ransomware and how

68
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,080
they're going to really deal with that

69
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,879
the second one was now that their

70
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:51,120
acceleration to cloud and migration to

71
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:54,080
digital state got accelerated how

72
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,879
they're going to make sure the security

73
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:58,959
of the resources

74
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:00,560
and the configuration of all the

75
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,640
application and workloads that are in

76
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:05,599
the cloud is being done appropriately

77
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:07,920
the third one was how are they going to

78
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,319
make sure their hybrid multi-cloud

79
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:12,560
environment is secure

80
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,480
fourth one how they're going to stay

81
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,239
both secure and how they're going to

82
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:18,400
keep their employees productive

83
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,159
and finally the last one which is not a

84
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:22,319
surprise and we've been dealing with it

85
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:24,480
for a few years was

86
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:27,120
how are they going to really deal with

87
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,920
the talent shortage in both security and

88
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,680
cloud industries

89
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:32,480
so

90
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:35,760
i know zero trust is a very overused

91
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,720
board and you probably heard it hear it

92
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:41,280
over and over again but if we think

93
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:44,640
about it it brings us back to the basics

94
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,959
and the hygiene of what everybody needs

95
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:48,799
to be doing but you will be surprised to

96
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:51,519
see a lot of organizations are still not

97
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:53,120
really

98
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,640
doing the basics

99
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,799
so if you think about zero trust the

100
00:03:56,799 --> 00:03:59,120
main principles are basics the first one

101
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:02,480
is how important the identity is right

102
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:05,280
so our sisa always says the hackers they

103
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,920
don't break in they log in so it's very

104
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:10,239
important to

105
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:12,720
really pay attention to your identity

106
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,959
make sure your front door is

107
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:16,560
protected

108
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,959
use multi-factor authentication use

109
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:20,798
conditional access and all the

110
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:24,960
information available to you to automate

111
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,960
the enforcement of multi-factor

112
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:29,360
authentication and allowing someone into

113
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,680
your environment the second one is use

114
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:35,280
the list privilege access right and um

115
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,759
just in time just enough access

116
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:40,880
use their risk-based adaptive policies

117
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,639
to protect yourself and then the last

118
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:45,520
one is really assume breach

119
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:49,120
and design with the assumption that your

120
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:52,400
users the data devices application

121
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,800
network and infrastructure all of them

122
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,360
can be breached and how can we come back

123
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,080
to

124
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,000
um normal

125
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,160
activities as quickly as possible and

126
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,840
detect our response as quickly as

127
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,000
possible and i just want to say

128
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,320
something on the last point on the

129
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,400
shortage of the talent and what can we

130
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,680
do about it

131
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:14,400
so for us we really need to start

132
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:17,120
investing in our people

133
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:20,240
so if you think about the fact that um

134
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,720
every person can be a defender

135
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:25,440
if they have the passion if they get get

136
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,919
the right education and training they

137
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:29,919
can be on our side and they can help us

138
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:33,120
defend uh our um our countries our

139
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:36,240
society and our world and also if we

140
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,800
really start hiring more diverse

141
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,600
candidates because the security

142
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,440
and the challenges we need to address

143
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,520
for security they're so diverse and so

144
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:48,080
complex and we need also diverse

145
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,840
candidates in order to address those

146
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:52,000
issues and when i talk about um

147
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,960
diversity yes i'm talking about gender

148
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:57,600
diversity race diversity but also

149
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,199
different backgrounds different

150
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:02,000
education different culture uh

151
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,600
different upbringing

152
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,400
and all those can really help us address

153
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,960
this challenge that they're all facing

154
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:11,840
so thank you so much for listening thank

155

177
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:12,400

178
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:16,000
um and then uh and then next me is uh

179
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,039
lydia giuliano security advisor and

180

183
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,960
and then finally ryan flores senior

184
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,880
manager

185
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,240
threat research

186
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,840
trend micro

187
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:36,479
so here we go let's kick this thing off

188
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:39,599
i'll start with um

189
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:40,800
everybody has seen the meme and the

190
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,960
jokes about

191
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,360
what was the motivator in your company's

192
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,840
i.t acceleration was it

193
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:50,240
uh governance was it this was it the cio

194
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,960
the cto or was it covet 19 right covet

195
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,879
19 was the thing that

196
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:57,360
right so quickly just give us a quick

197
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,120
glimpse from your perspective what did

198
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:02,400
kovid 19 actually accelerate

199
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,800
or if it was going to be an inevitable

200
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,160
five years to get there we got there in

201
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,919
one year like what what can we attribute

202
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:10,080
to covet 19 i mean it's obvious like

203
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,240
people now use microsoft teams right

204
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,840
people use zoom people use these things

205
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:15,280
they weren't really using before even

206
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:17,039
though we had skype and we had other

207
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:18,720
platforms that just they weren't used

208
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:21,199
until the imperative of kobe 19.

209
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:22,879
anything

210
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:24,720
what happened what did covet 19 force

211
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:27,360
you to do um i can start so um trend

212
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,599
microsoft vendors i can provide a vendor

213
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:30,479
um

214
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:32,240
what you call this perspective on on on

215
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:35,120
this we actually grew at um you know our

216
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:37,839
sales for cloud security products

217
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:39,599
grew during the pandemic and that's

218
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:42,159
because a lot of the automation

219
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:45,360
integration projects were pushed way so

220
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,959
everybody that was doing cloud just did

221
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:49,040
more of it faster yes because you know

222
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:51,760
they a lot of their platforms a lot of

223
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:54,240
their projects needs to be rolled out

224
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,000
immediately to support the business

225
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,200
during the pandemic right because

226
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,399
nobody's going up in the office they're

227
00:08:58,399 --> 00:08:59,760
doing it remote so you better get your

228
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,440
cloud working yes so that was just a

229
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:04,160
huge acceleration yes okay so we can say

230
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,959
cloud adoption accelerated

231
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:11,120
anything we teach to 39 000 students and

232
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:14,240
we were starting our semester three days

233
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,240
later then the first case was discovered

234
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,920
in italy how do you think my life

235
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:19,760
changed

236
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:22,480
um welcome virtual teacher

237
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:27,360
yeah so we deployed the 900 classes on

238
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,200
teams in a week

239
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,399
but we we

240
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:32,640
polytechnic had never taught anything

241
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,720
online never again so

242
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:37,680
it forced a university to go from zero

243
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:40,080
to online you know unfortunately not

244
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,080
from zero in the sense that

245
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,880
most of i mean office 365 was already

246
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:47,680
deployed to students to professors so it

247
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,040
was already there

248
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,000
at the very least the basic

249
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,279
infrastructure but for other

250
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:53,120
universities yes from zero i mean

251
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,399
culturally

252
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:57,040
the university is not really we are not

253
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,160
there yet

254
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:02,320
it's it's very hard for for speakers i i

255
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,839
see some speakers here in the in the

256
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:06,640
room they can they can tell probably but

257
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:09,600
for speakers for listeners and for

258
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,399
professor and and students to adapt to a

259
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:14,959
different medium the medium is part of

260
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:16,880
the way you convey the message so so

261
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:19,200
this for me it was like the virtual

262
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,720
distance learning

263
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,880
conferences all of that it was kind of

264
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,800
pie in the sky and then it had to get

265
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:27,440
concrete like really quickly but also

266
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:30,240
for the community i think um

267
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,240
you said before there's a group of

268
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:34,560
people discussing information security

269
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,560
which one tells us you're old because

270
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:39,600
it's cyber security now and two

271
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,040
um

272
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,360
these type of occasions did not happen

273
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,360
for a couple of years

274
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:48,000
and while we all are used to communicate

275
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
also electronically

276
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,399
the value of seeing and meeting peers

277
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:55,680
face to face and bring storm and discuss

278
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,600
was not there for a couple of years and

279
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,760
i don't think it was really substituted

280
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,360
by the electronic means

281
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:04,720
yeah yeah covet 19 anything okay yeah go

282
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,720
for it uh it was really interesting

283
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:09,200
because when covert hit

284
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,959
a lot of the brands are shut down

285
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:12,959
branches at the unknown

286
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:15,920
financial absolutely absolutely

287
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:16,800
and

288
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,560
banks were obviously struggling people

289
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,000
still needed to get loans whether it was

290
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,800
a business loan or a home loan or

291
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,320
a personal loan or whatever and with the

292
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,160
branches closed

293
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,200
how people are going to send their

294
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,120
documents in you know for people that

295
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,720
would traditionally walk oh they just

296
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:33,680
use the facts well they could

297
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:34,480
um

298
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:37,120
so in fact

299
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,640
so the a lot of the things that we were

300
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,800
seeing was those really fast spin-ups of

301
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,480
those cloud solutions so that people

302
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,959
could adopt online really quickly

303
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:47,040
and then with the cloud the cloud enable

304
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,839
enablement program you've gone from hey

305
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:51,440
we've got these great amis that we're

306
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,880
just going to use the default out of the

307
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:55,200
box we'd better make it some sort of sol

308
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,839
build so just spinning up things a lot

309
00:11:57,839 --> 00:11:58,959
faster than what you would normally

310
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:01,360
expect

311
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:03,200
now while we were talking about while we

312
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,279
were talking about online learning

313
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:06,880
online tuitions

314
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:09,120
i completed my degree my

315
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,680
second master's cyber law during this

316
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,920
pandemic it motivated me to do because i

317
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,600
could spend some time

318
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,240
and go ahead and learn something new so

319
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,880
it was a time when a lot of people lost

320
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:23,360
to jobs but at the same time after some

321
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:25,279
time like after a few months

322
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:28,160
yeah we had so many new jobs coming up

323
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,920
because a lot of breaches happen while

324
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:32,959
we talk about adoption we just wanted to

325
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:35,200
go with the lightning speed the most

326
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,279
important thing was we were losing on

327
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:39,200
the smallest of items think about

328
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,200
security misconfigurations a lot of

329
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,120
issues came up broken authorization

330
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:45,040
broken authentication anything that you

331
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,560
can think of

332
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:48,720
just was there because we wanted to run

333
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,639
the business at that time because nobody

334
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:52,560
anticipated that the whole world was

335
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:53,839
shut down

336
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:55,600
nobody anticipated that we would be

337
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,519
working remotely i never anticipated

338
00:12:57,519 --> 00:12:59,200
that for two and a half years we would

339
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,040
be working remotely and after three

340
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:02,240
years we're going to be meeting in

341
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:05,680
person so a lot of changes we saw and

342
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:08,399
now it motivated us to think about how

343
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:10,560
we can be adversary ready in any

344
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,000
situation

345
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,440
thinking about cloud security to

346
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,200
application security to network security

347
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,600
covering everything and then we just saw

348
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:21,200
about zero trust it became the buzzword

349
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,200
even if it's been there for a very long

350
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,560
time

351
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:28,560
so everybody said we have zero trust

352
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:31,600
okay so what i'm hearing though is speed

353
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,760
everything got stress tested right maybe

354
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,200
you had some remote workers now you have

355
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,680
100 remote okay great

356
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:40,399
i learned a lot during covet 19 i got to

357
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:42,959
test a lot of products but now

358
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:45,680
we've got russia invading ukraine

359
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:48,639
so if things were accelerated

360
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:50,639
with covet 19 and all the things that

361
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:52,399
enabled us to do

362
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:54,079
now think about what is russia invading

363
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:55,600
ukraine it's like

364
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,279
everything's accelerated again can it

365
00:13:57,279 --> 00:13:59,680
get accelerated any faster but now it

366
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:01,600
seems to be not exercising on a remote

367
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:04,160
work or cloud it's exercising more like

368
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:07,760
compliance or sanctions or you're not

369
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,440
doing business there anymore or data

370
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:12,079
localization you can't store that data

371
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:13,120
so

372
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,240
think about everything we just went

373
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:16,000
through with covid what's gonna happen

374
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,040
what are the fallout what are these

375
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,320
second order effects that we're not

376
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,160
fully and uh

377
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:23,680
appreciating yet around russia

378
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:25,920
right um

379
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,600
and i've got a couple thoughts around

380
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,360
this but i wanna

381
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,120
before i jump in

382
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,519
so i think that the first thing

383
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:34,880
that

384
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:37,760
that this showed us

385
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,519
is that um

386
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:42,720
thomas reed's book from ten years ago

387
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,880
cyber war will not take place was

388
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:47,040
prophetic

389
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:49,040
it was not it was very well taught which

390
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,639
is a different thing but it sounded

391
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:52,480
prophetic

392
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,560
because in the end as you were citing

393
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,560
all of the impacts

394
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:58,880
none of them was related with cyber

395
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:01,680
attacks they were all related with

396
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:04,240
relocation of business shutting down

397
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:07,199
things controlling what's going on

398
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:09,360
all things that are cyber security

399
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,440
related but not the things that you

400
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:13,120
would maybe

401
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,279
instinctively have associated with a

402
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:16,959
conflict started right like there's not

403
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:18,800
a russian special forces team

404
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,639
parachuting in to reconfigure the

405
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:21,760
routers

406
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,440
exactly right i mean they're not

407
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,040
shooting the digital bullets from the

408
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:27,199
digital high ground with the kill chain

409
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:28,000
to

410
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,320
affect mcdonald's deciding whether or

411
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:32,320
not they're doing business in moscow

412
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,880
right they seem disconnected

413
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:35,600
and

414
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,279
and also

415
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:39,279
there is this

416
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:42,079
interesting effect

417
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:44,160
that

418
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:45,199
we

419
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:48,959
already have a huge information flow

420
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:52,959
problem throughout this industry

421
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:58,160
um which we always informally solved

422
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:58,880
i'm

423
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:03,279
so ryan you can kind of produce

424
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:04,320
but

425
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:05,759
you're hinting at

426
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:08,639
antivirus companies exchanging things

427
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:11,120
beyond company policy with each other

428
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:13,120
because that's the way you get things

429
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,320
fixed

430
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:17,519
or security informal information

431
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:20,560
change exchange and now kovid has made

432
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:22,800
the informal exchange difficult first

433
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,959
and this is going to make it almost

434
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:28,880
impossible for certain people to to do

435
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:31,759
um and that's going to impact us all of

436
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:35,120
us not not just just like us but all of

437
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,720
us

438
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:37,600
um

439
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,440
you have a thought i do um it was

440
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,600
interesting when the sanctions started

441
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:42,560
um

442
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:44,720
we saw a lot of teams scramble

443
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,800
especially around the iban networks just

444
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,399
trying to get everything settled and all

445
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:50,959
in place but i think

446
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:52,639
the um

447
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:54,639
the spin-off of that was what are our

448
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:56,959
asses what are our assess partners doing

449
00:16:56,959 --> 00:16:58,880
and do we need to impose the same sort

450
00:16:58,880 --> 00:16:59,839
of

451
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:01,519
the same sort of controls you could be

452
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:03,040
counting on a sas partner and they could

453
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,640
be like no we interpret the rules

454
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:05,919
differently than you

455
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:08,160
sorry yeah that's exactly that's exactly

456
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,839
what happened and then

457
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:11,439
and then you know do you follow the

458
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:13,520
policies of you know whatever the sector

459
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:15,760
that you're following or do we hey let's

460
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:18,160
just do block by geo location and what

461
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,359
does that look like because we know that

462
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:21,439
that can all be circumvented so it was

463
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:23,119
very interesting but it's it's very

464
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:25,199
ambulance chasing like it's quick let's

465
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:26,319
all do this and then you don't hear

466
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:28,480
anything about it again yeah

467
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,799
one of the things i find

468
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:31,919
most most

469
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:34,320
interesting about

470
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:36,880
this era the the russia

471
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:40,240
that's not the covid era is this what i

472
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:41,679
talked about a little bit earlier the

473
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:43,679
super empowered individuals

474
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:46,000
and uh i don't know in the audience

475
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,520
maybe not very popular in this area but

476
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:48,720
um there's a

477
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:51,039
book written by neil stephenson was very

478
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:53,280
fundamental in my formative years a snow

479
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,880
crash

480
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,799
and in the book snow crash there's this

481
00:17:56,799 --> 00:17:58,240
one individual

482
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:00,320
that has a hard wired to his heart

483
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:03,360
monitor uh a nuclear bomb

484
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:05,120
and he's got the nuclear bomb tied to

485
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:06,720
his like i think it's in his motorcycle

486
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:07,760
or something

487
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:09,440
but the point of the whole character

488
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:11,200
with the bomb is that he's a sovereign

489
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,760
individual and he's his own nation and

490
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,840
he travels around in other countries

491
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:17,440
because he's super empowered because

492
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:19,679
he's got this bomb wired to him so

493
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:21,200
people kind of let him do what he wants

494
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,520
to do

495
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:26,160
in this era we have super empowered

496
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,760
companies

497
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,480
and so i mean microsoft is releasing

498
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:33,039
fantastic intelligence reports about the

499
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:34,880
network traffic they're seeing in russia

500
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,080
but they can do that because they're

501
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:38,400
getting telemetry from all of their

502
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,640
operating systems right they are super

503
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:42,799
empowered they can see things nobody

504
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:44,559
else can see and they're deciding to

505
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:46,559
take that super empowerment and to

506
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:48,559
publish reports to everybody's

507
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:51,360
transparency benefit like

508
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:52,799
microsoft doesn't have anything really

509
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:54,960
too much to publish around covet 19 but

510
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:57,600
come to a cyber war in europe they do

511
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,440
same thing a lot of individuals have a

512
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:01,280
lot of power your employees have a lot

513
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:04,640
of discretionary power to decide

514
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:07,679
that is a new

515
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:10,320
thing that has not existed before i mean

516
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:12,480
you could joke paul vixie when he was

517
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:15,120
managing ise and controlled i think bind

518
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:16,799
and bind was like 85 percent of the

519
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:18,799
world's dns resolvers you could joke

520
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:20,799
that paul vixie controlled 80 of the

521
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:23,280
world's internet name resolution not

522
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:25,280
anymore but there were very few people

523
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:27,919
with that kind of power now

524
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:29,840
i'm really fascinated

525
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:31,679
that that we're entering this ability of

526
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:34,400
where civil society the microsoft apples

527
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:35,360
the

528
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:38,720
we have the power and individuals like

529
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:41,280
mongodb are deciding whether or not

530
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,280
russia gets to

531
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:46,240
be on the internet that's super scary

532
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:48,000
but it's super empowering i mean what do

533
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,080
you

534
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:52,080
how do you approach that mentally

535
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:53,360
because that is quite different than how

536
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:56,240
we were approaching this a year ago

537
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:58,880
well everything that's old is new again

538
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:01,600
because i i think you remember and i

539
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:02,720
remember

540
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:05,039
years where there were hacking groups

541
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:07,039
that decided which nation was on the

542
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:09,679
internet or not at certain hours of the

543
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:10,640
day

544
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:14,720
but um it was a different internet

545
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,240
it was not

546
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:19,679
that critical to society so i i really

547
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:21,679
think that what you are saying makes uh

548
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:23,360
makes a lot of sense

549
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:24,720
and

550
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,559
in addition

551
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:30,080
all of these uh um

552
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:32,799
you know all of the governance or lack

553
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:34,720
of governance that underlies the

554
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:37,120
internet

555
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:39,600
was basically predicated

556
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:40,480
on

557
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:43,120
a cooperating world

558
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:45,440
yes there were conflicts where there

559
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:46,840
were

560
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:49,679
attritions but not really

561
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:51,360
like

562
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:53,919
cold war era style

563
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:56,240
big conflicts

564
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:59,520
how does that self-governance work how

565
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:01,520
does that work now right right there's a

566
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:02,960
crisis of

567
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,720
right in internet governance right

568
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:06,159
that's precisely what that's so

569
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:08,159
precisely what i was talking about and i

570
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:10,159
didn't want to enter things that you may

571
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:12,799
not be able to discuss that much but

572
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:14,080
um

573
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:17,039
but that's a that's a very

574
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:18,880
interesting thought for right now

575
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:21,120
because it's an emergency but also for

576
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:23,200
for the foreseeable future

577
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,799
um

578
00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:26,000
right

579
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,400
what's the legitimacy of these

580
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,640
governance models right i guess that's

581
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:34,640
right that's the stress test right now

582
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,840
and that's where the influence lies the

583
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:42,000
way you said all these organizations

584
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,080
when they have the power to decide

585
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:46,400
whether to run the business there or not

586
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,840
because of the situations which are

587
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:49,840
happening makes a lot of difference they

588
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:52,400
can decide where the industry can go how

589
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,240
things can change and if someone is

590
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:56,480
doing not the right thing how to stop

591
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:58,159
them and where to stop them and that's

592
00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:00,240
how governance can be strategized and

593
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:02,880
it's not just in the hand of government

594
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,000
but now

595
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,320
in the organizations as well and they're

596
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:08,799
supporting their people that yes this is

597
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:10,960
the right thing to do

598
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:12,400
we saw that with the elections as well

599
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,919
with twitter as well it's not much

600
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:15,039
different

601
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:17,120
right right twitter exercising their

602
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:18,799
moderation

603
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:21,120
so um i think like one of the things

604
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:23,760
that i noticed like

605
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:26,960
we were writing a report on

606
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:29,120
cyber attacks happening you know in

607
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,880
conjunction with the ukraine and russia

608
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,000
crisis

609
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,919
and then we were thinking how to

610
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:35,600
properly call it

611
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:38,720
and of course we cannot call it

612
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:41,280
special military action

613
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:44,559
right because if we use that term we we

614
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:46,240
are aligning yourself with russian

615
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:50,320
perspective yes so even how you call

616
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:51,919
a certain

617
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:53,760
situation

618
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:56,320
matters and reflects on what the

619
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:57,600
company's

620
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:00,400
position is on that particular map and

621
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:02,000
your employees if you have a lot of

622
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,159
employees in ukraine

623
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:06,159
and none in russia it's different for

624
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:07,360
your company than if it's the other way

625
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:10,159
around they're all in russia like

626
00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:12,400
but so your employees might have a

627
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:14,000
completely different idea than your

628
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,720
company yes yes exactly and

629
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:19,200
um if i might just add

630
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:21,280
it's not just us

631
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:23,919
governments private companies who are

632
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:25,440
having this problem

633
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:28,880
um a ransomware group conti you know

634
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:31,840
they had the conti leaks and that was

635
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:33,840
in part triggered

636
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:34,880
when

637
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,480
some of the group russian group members

638
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,320
said that they are supporting

639
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:39,440
russia

640
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:41,279
and then you know other people got

641
00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:43,520
pissed on that and then had the leak so

642
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:45,760
even cyber criminal organizations are

643
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:47,279
affected on

644
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:49,679
so i guess cyber criminal governance is

645
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:52,080
also having a crisis of

646
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:55,760
crisis of legitimacy right

647
00:23:57,679 --> 00:23:59,679
so

648
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:01,520
let's see

649
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:02,720
speed

650
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:04,799
talk about speed for just a second so

651
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:06,880
years ago i would go to these meetings

652
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,559
um i was lucky enough to go to a couple

653
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:11,360
of these uh cisco

654
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:12,320
host

655
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:14,159
meetings and they'd have all these top

656
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:15,919
ceos from the world's biggest 50

657
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:17,360
companies and you'd listen to what their

658
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:18,640
concerns are

659
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:21,200
and every time you went the number one

660
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:22,960
concern wasn't regulation it wasn't

661
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:24,880
pricing competition or anything it was

662
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:27,760
speed they always cared how can i go

663
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:29,919
faster how can i reconfigure my network

664
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:31,840
how can i adapt to the new market speed

665
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:33,520
speed speed if you said the word speed

666
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:35,200
out loud three times you want a business

667
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:37,120
contract

668
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:37,919
so

669
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:40,080
here we are covet accelerated everything

670
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:42,080
again so the people pushing for speed

671
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:43,919
were probably right they had an

672
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:45,360
advantage

673
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:46,880
do they have an advantage now in russia

674
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:48,240
probably too right they can move the

675
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:50,080
networks away from russia or ukraine or

676
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:52,320
european right

677
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:53,679
does speed

678
00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:55,919
always win

679
00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:58,799
is that the thing we've been overlooking

680
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:01,200
should we be in the speed business

681
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,320
right

682
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:04,080
you know does security have a

683
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:05,600
relationship with speed if we're the

684
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:07,120
anchor

685
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:09,440
right and speed wins we're in a losing

686
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:10,400
position

687
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,919
and so the way i try to deal with this

688
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:13,440
is i say no

689
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,760
security is like giant brakes on a race

690
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:17,840
car and you put those giant brakes on

691
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:19,279
the race car so the race car can go

692
00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:20,480
faster

693
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:23,520
if security can provide the reliability

694
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:25,360
or some sort of confidence for the

695
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:27,120
company to go faster because it can

696
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:28,960
manage the risks better

697
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,480
then the company can move faster than

698
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:32,320
the competitors and have the same or

699
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:33,919
less risks

700
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:36,480
i would love to hear

701
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:39,840
so first of all for any drug enforcement

702
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:43,520
agency in attendance is meaning speed as

703
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:46,320
distance over time that's important in

704
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:48,640
particular when i said in the business

705
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,799
of speed that's what it meant that's

706
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:53,200
that's important so first of all

707
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:56,480
second um i think that well it's you

708
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:57,200
know

709
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:59,760
in in the in the branch of everything

710
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:01,919
that's old is new again

711
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:03,840
it's it's not like you couldn't read

712
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:05,919
about the advantages of speed in uh in

713
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:07,360
suns or

714
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:08,080
or

715
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:09,600
in any of the

716
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:12,880
uh ancient texts and strategies so

717
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:15,360
it's not it's not new being but it's not

718
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:17,760
it's ends to a mean it's not like now

719
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:19,279
i'm a little bit faster so i make more

720
00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:23,360
money not necessarily so i i i'm more

721
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:27,120
maybe more than fast what we mean is

722
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:30,880
agile in in reconfiguring in adapting

723
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:34,080
and agile in adapting is is also on an

724
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:36,640
evolutionary scale something that maybe

725
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:39,279
it means it's keeping your teams fresh

726
00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:40,159
yeah

727
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:42,159
yeah i think that's uh that's definitely

728
00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:43,440
an advantage

729
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:45,360
and the other

730
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:47,039
thing is

731
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:49,360
that suddenly

732
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:53,200
being the larger and more worldwide you

733
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:54,720
are

734
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:57,520
the more exposed you are which used to

735
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:59,919
be pretty much the other way um

736
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:02,240
a company that was large enough

737
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:04,960
would be able to sustain impacts in any

738
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:07,919
of specific areas right now

739
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:10,960
worldwide tensions the larger you are

740
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:13,200
you are constantly the more tax service

741
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:14,799
you might have yes that's an attack

742
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:17,520
surface as well

743
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:21,039
yeah um

744
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:24,320
speed the need for speed um

745
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:26,720
it's funny i i agree with stefano to a

746
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:28,640
degree it's it is a little bit old as

747
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:31,679
new again i remember 20 years ago a long

748
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:33,440
time ago when i started in security

749
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:35,679
actually no i was a developer and we

750
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:37,760
would do these distributed make files we

751
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:39,600
would automate everything

752
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,440
we would have security patterns in our

753
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,480
code

754
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:44,960
and that was a way to automate security

755
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:46,159
and test that there weren't any

756
00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:48,640
vulnerabilities in the code it's all new

757
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:49,600
again

758
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:51,760
and at least i know in my role we've got

759
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:54,320
dedicated security people that are part

760
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:56,880
of the team we're not no people

761
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:58,720
i'm not going to say you can't do this

762
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:01,520
it's how do we make it

763
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:03,440
how do you make the solution so that

764
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:05,279
it's usable for

765
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:08,000
um your customers but also secure as

766
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,440
well

767
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:11,440
yeah there's this this is this um tony

768
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:13,679
seger who was for years at the national

769
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:16,559
security agency he ran the um

770
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:18,320
the protection side

771
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:20,159
and he used to only say that you can't

772
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:22,720
go the united states can't go one on one

773
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:24,559
with its adversaries there's too many

774
00:28:24,559 --> 00:28:26,960
people right you can't go

775
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:28,799
so you have to automate so you have to

776
00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:30,080
spend a lot of time figuring out what

777
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,840
you can automate so you can reserve the

778
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:34,559
humans for the highest value use right

779
00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:36,720
not slogging through log files they have

780
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:38,480
to do the high value things that humans

781
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:40,080
can do so you have to spend a lot of

782
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:41,600
time and money doing that and then at

783
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,600
the end you have to automate everything

784
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:46,240
else it's like that seems to be your

785
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:48,960
path and so if if you

786
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,960
were in the speed game and you were

787
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:52,640
automating or you're picking

788
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:54,480
products or you're picking technologies

789
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:56,240
languages to develop in

790
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:58,799
how does that that speed or security

791
00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:00,960
drive what you buy what vendors you pick

792
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:02,960
what operating systems you run like are

793
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:04,559
there certain winners that are we just

794
00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:06,080
know we're gonna that's the way of

795
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:08,720
course everybody does that

796
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:10,480
i don't like picking vendors because

797
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:12,240
it's not about picking vendor products

798
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:13,440
it's about understanding what your

799
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:15,440
business requirements are understanding

800
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:18,240
what the end the end goal is so if we

801
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:20,799
talk about just whether you're trying to

802
00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:22,960
um create like a secure

803
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:25,120
soe or you're trying to create um some

804
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:27,200
sort of infrastructure as code it's all

805
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:28,320
automated

806
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:29,679
shouldn't be looking at vendors or you

807
00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:30,880
shouldn't be looking at particular

808
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:32,240
products it's

809
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:34,240
or even if you've got an enterprise-wide

810
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:36,559
solution you might be working with a dev

811
00:29:36,559 --> 00:29:38,080
that that enterprise solution doesn't

812
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:39,279
suit them so you need to go for a

813
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:41,520
bespoke but it's more important that it

814
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:42,880
can scan

815
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:45,200
these pieces of code or it can scan

816
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,279
these types of things so it's about

817
00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:48,320
understanding

818
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:50,799
what exactly what the end goal is is it

819
00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:53,120
about simplification like things have

820
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:55,440
gotten so hyper complicated you if you

821
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:57,760
simplify your attack surface you might

822
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:59,600
not have every feature

823
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:01,360
but maybe it's easier for your team to

824
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:03,039
manage absolutely you think so

825
00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:05,360
simplification might be something to pay

826
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:07,039
attention to yeah because i mean if you

827
00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:08,720
look if you if you've got one enterprise

828
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:10,080
solution say for example like check

829
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:11,600
marks and i'm not i'm not picking on

830
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:13,840
that at all it may not integrate with an

831
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:17,039
ide or you know or gear or git labs or

832
00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:18,880
something like that it may not work so

833
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:21,279
they they might find that an iq might be

834
00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:22,880
better or something like that but the

835
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:24,559
point is that you're still doing the

836
00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:26,240
same checks and balances it just might

837
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:27,919
be a different fit because the language

838
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:30,480
is different or something like that

839
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:32,080
it is like

840
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:34,240
you have multiple doors in your house

841
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:36,640
multiple windows but when you leave out

842
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:38,880
you make sure you close everything and

843
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:40,399
the most important thing is that you

844
00:30:40,399 --> 00:30:42,559
getting to know what you want and what

845
00:30:42,559 --> 00:30:44,880
you have because a lot of times people

846
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:47,679
tend to buy every vendor that they see

847
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:50,080
oh they go into the rat race oh this is

848
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:52,000
one people are using oh my computer is

849
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,679
using i mean i think you could probably

850
00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:55,039
spend every dollar in your budget doing

851
00:30:55,039 --> 00:30:57,200
that right absolutely yeah

852
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:58,960
so when you do that then you tend to

853
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:02,000
lose on what you really need

854
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,679
because if you don't know what you need

855
00:31:03,679 --> 00:31:05,279
you will keep buying the products and it

856
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:06,799
is never going to serve the purpose and

857
00:31:06,799 --> 00:31:09,200
when you talk about speed to attain that

858
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,519
right speed you need to know everything

859
00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:13,600
about you first and then go over the

860
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:15,200
full speed that yes

861
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:17,200
breaches will happen failures will

862
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:19,760
happen but then how come back you from

863
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:21,519
uh how you come back from that failure

864
00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:23,760
is the most important aspect

865
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:25,840
okay so we've got about 10 minutes left

866
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:28,799
i'm going to do a um a throwback to a

867
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:31,760
question we had years ago in black hat

868
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:33,279
in europe

869
00:31:33,279 --> 00:31:34,960
in the uk and then we're going to open

870
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:36,640
it up for any questions if you want us

871
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:38,799
to talk about any questions you may have

872
00:31:38,799 --> 00:31:41,919
so the question is around deception

873
00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:44,000
how many of you remember

874
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,600
when everything was about deception

875
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:47,279
networks and i remember uh gaddy you

876
00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:49,039
know gary everyone right so gary evron

877
00:31:49,039 --> 00:31:51,200
gets on and he helps pioneer the

878
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:53,200
deception marketplace and he starts off

879
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:54,480
and i'm talking to him and he's like

880
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:56,640
there's three deception vendors right

881
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:59,200
now we're one of them and in six months

882
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:01,519
we guess they'll be 20

883
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:03,200
and it went to like 50 or something and

884
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:05,200
then the market collapsed again right

885
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:06,640
and so now we're not talking about

886
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:08,399
deception anymore really we're talking

887
00:32:08,399 --> 00:32:11,120
about canary

888
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:13,600
little tiny finger of what deception

889
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:15,679
could promise but we're all buying the

890
00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:17,200
one little finger we're not buying the

891
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:19,360
full feature right so

892
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:22,080
just like everything else that was had a

893
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:25,279
lot of promise and then it failed

894
00:32:25,279 --> 00:32:26,559
what went wrong

895
00:32:26,559 --> 00:32:29,120
why aren't we trapping everybody in a

896
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:30,640
hall of mirrors

897
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:32,960
so uh i make a couple of observations

898
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:34,640
from someone who conspicuously that's

899
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:36,559
not my product because i'm a university

900
00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:38,399
professor so

901
00:32:38,399 --> 00:32:39,760
but

902
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:41,600
the first observation is you can still

903
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:43,919
say europe when you refer to the uk

904
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:45,600
that's that's fine

905
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:47,760
but no they're not really okay it's okay

906
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:49,360
it's more of an aspirational thing at

907
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:51,760
this point between the uk and europe the

908
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:54,840
the second thing is

909
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:56,720
um

910
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:58,240
i think that

911
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:00,240
what has happened you you mentioned

912
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:02,320
deception and and that's

913
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:04,159
and that's fine um

914
00:33:04,159 --> 00:33:06,000
but we could mention any other number of

915
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,559
technologies so i will respond with an

916
00:33:08,559 --> 00:33:13,039
observation that one of our

917
00:33:13,039 --> 00:33:16,080
also board members but

918
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:18,320
black hat speakers eric havencic once

919
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:20,960
made while we were walking around in the

920
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:25,120
humongous vendor all of rsa

921
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:28,000
and it was like okay so we walked for

922
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:28,880
this

923
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:31,200
and i counted in my head

924
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:34,000
what these people were selling

925
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:38,080
and it's like these five things

926
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:39,840
if you count right it's like you could

927
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:42,960
reduce them down to five things yeah you

928
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:45,679
and and in fact those are the four or

929
00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:47,760
five things i mean it's probably more

930
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:50,240
than five but it's still a very limited

931
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:53,039
amount of classes of things that the

932
00:33:53,039 --> 00:33:56,000
security product can do for you

933
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,960
because and this is the hidden not so

934
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:00,960
eden because we all know probably but

935
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:04,240
the the unspoken secret is

936
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:06,240
that there's only so much that you can

937
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:08,239
put in a product

938
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:10,639
most of what security people do is in

939
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:12,239
here

940
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:15,280
and that's part of the process that you

941
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:17,918
were saying before trying to automate

942
00:34:17,918 --> 00:34:20,239
but at the same time there's a lot of

943
00:34:20,239 --> 00:34:23,440
things that can't we can't really

944
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:25,520
automate we either we can't right now or

945
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:27,918
we can't at all that's that's

946
00:34:27,918 --> 00:34:29,679
that's the try to automate a business

947
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:32,399
process decision right yeah or try to

948
00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:34,560
automate threat modeling

949
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:35,839
and like

950
00:34:35,839 --> 00:34:38,399
90 of my discussions on security are

951
00:34:38,399 --> 00:34:40,399
reduced to someone failed at threat

952
00:34:40,399 --> 00:34:43,760
modeling so that's so adam shostak this

953
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:46,879
is for you so uh but um

954
00:34:46,879 --> 00:34:48,800
this

955
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:50,800
this is something that you cannot really

956
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:53,040
automate you can support but not

957
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:55,280
automate and there's a lot of security

958
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:56,320
decisions that you cannot really

959
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:58,560
automate so so deception just fell into

960
00:34:58,560 --> 00:34:59,599
that

961
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:01,520
or was it more like well okay we've got

962
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:03,280
them in the hall of mirrors it was not

963
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:06,880
in the five and so it kind of fell out

964
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:11,040
right it wasn't a core knee right so

965
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:13,279
um

966
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:17,280
yeah i think deception technology has

967
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:20,079
its place for example if you're

968
00:35:20,079 --> 00:35:22,240
an intelligence agency or

969
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:24,240
you know a high-profile government

970
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:26,000
agency but if you're

971
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,280
not even a

972
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:30,960
fortune 500 company like what

973
00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:33,119
so i think there's also a limited market

974
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:35,200
for it and that's why the canary which

975
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:37,359
is a smaller version of it would have

976
00:35:37,359 --> 00:35:40,480
its place on most countries right

977
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:42,720
right but i think there's also this

978
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:44,160
buzzword thing that

979
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:46,880
goes on every couple of years wherein

980
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:49,520
gartner's analyst needs to have that new

981
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:50,960
shiny word to

982
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:52,160
to talk

983
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:54,800
and a lot of vendors ourselves included

984
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:57,520
sometimes would latch on into this and

985
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:59,520
just say behavior monitoring oh that's

986
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:01,920
the that's the buzzword right now okay

987
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:04,079
we have a some feature that looks like

988
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:05,680
that we'll call it like that we'll call

989
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:09,040
it the the fileless zero canary yeah

990
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:10,320
yeah

991
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:13,280
okay that makes sense um so now let's go

992
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:15,040
to the audience

993
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:16,720
anybody have any questions if not i'll

994
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:19,280
just keep running the microphone here

995
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:21,200
anybody want to hear us riff on any

996
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:23,280
topics in particular we'll get you a

997
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:24,960
microphone

998
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:26,400
if not okay we got one question back

999
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:28,480
here

1000
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:29,839
if you could just say your name and and

1001
00:36:29,839 --> 00:36:31,359
what company or what you're where you're

1002
00:36:31,359 --> 00:36:33,440
coming from hi my name's justin i'm from

1003
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:35,280
toyota financial services i was

1004
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:36,480
interested in your earlier comments

1005
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:38,320
about the um i can't remember what you

1006
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:40,480
what you phrased them as the hyper

1007
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:42,000
influential companies or something along

1008
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,359
those lines these these companies that

1009
00:36:43,359 --> 00:36:45,440
now have hyper empowered hyper power

1010
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:47,599
hyper empowered yeah um

1011
00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:50,960
it's kind of uh and you mentioned um

1012
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:52,400
cyberpunk books and things like that it

1013
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:53,920
kind of reminds me of that cyberpunk

1014
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:55,839
william gibson s future where companies

1015
00:36:55,839 --> 00:36:58,079
control things rather than governments

1016
00:36:58,079 --> 00:36:59,359
and it does bring up

1017
00:36:59,359 --> 00:37:01,440
does it not concerns around

1018
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:03,040
um what does that look like where does

1019
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:04,400
that slippery slide end up you know

1020
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:06,240
obviously the very controversial

1021
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:07,760
purchase of twitter by elon musk which

1022
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:09,680
is going on at the moment what does that

1023
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:11,359
mean in terms of him reversing some of

1024
00:37:11,359 --> 00:37:12,880
those policies you spoke about for

1025
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:14,240
twitter

1026
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:16,320
and it's not like a service you can just

1027
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:17,920
turn off these days i mean they sort of

1028
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:19,520
treat themselves as the the public

1029
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:21,599
square for for discourse and most of the

1030
00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:24,000
western democracy certainly um if they

1031
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,079
now to reverse their decision and decide

1032
00:37:26,079 --> 00:37:27,839
well they don't like what microsoft has

1033
00:37:27,839 --> 00:37:29,359
to say because they're a competitor

1034
00:37:29,359 --> 00:37:31,040
they're going to now start tuning them

1035
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:32,320
out of that conversation or something

1036
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:35,400
along those lines or a government in a

1037
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:38,400
non-uh you know a non-fascist regime or

1038
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:40,000
something like not russia not china but

1039
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,359
you know they decide they don't like

1040
00:37:41,359 --> 00:37:43,200
what boris johnson has to say anymore

1041
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:44,400
then they're going to start tuning him

1042
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:46,960
out of uk politics i'd like to hear your

1043
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:48,880
thoughts sort of on that part of that

1044
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:50,720
sort of argument of what that future

1045
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:53,359
might look like

1046
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:56,560
so i have one thought then i'll hand it

1047
00:37:56,560 --> 00:38:00,160
off to everybody and and that's

1048
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:02,000
it seems like it's a facet of the same

1049
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,320
kind of crisis of confidence that

1050
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:06,960
stefano was talking about um

1051
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:08,079
i'll look at it from a different

1052
00:38:08,079 --> 00:38:09,839
perspective i came

1053
00:38:09,839 --> 00:38:11,920
from the chief security officer at icann

1054
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:14,320
and when i was at icann

1055
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:15,920
everything was about trying to keep an

1056
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:18,480
open and interoperable internet so you

1057
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:20,079
had to try to please all the people all

1058
00:38:20,079 --> 00:38:21,280
the time

1059
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:23,680
and you could see certain players trying

1060
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:24,640
to

1061
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:26,320
segment the internet or put in

1062
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:28,079
alternative route servers or you could

1063
00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:30,320
tell that certain players were trying to

1064
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:32,560
but you had to go for this

1065
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:35,680
kind of open interoperable internet um

1066
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:37,520
and the engineers the people building

1067
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:40,400
the internet standards ietf

1068
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:42,240
they would make decisions to create a

1069
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:44,400
more secure internet so for example we

1070
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:45,760
would go with a

1071
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:47,920
secure bgp

1072
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:50,720
okay bgp routing is more secure now but

1073
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:52,320
it's also more brittle

1074
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:54,000
it's more fragile

1075
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:57,839
okay well people are hijacking our uh

1076
00:38:57,839 --> 00:39:00,480
asn numbers okay we're going to do uh

1077
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:01,440
our

1078
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:03,440
rpki

1079
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:05,920
okay now it's more fragile but it's more

1080
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:08,160
secure but it's more rigid

1081
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:10,240
and okay now we're doing dns sec because

1082
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:11,599
dns sec

1083
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:14,000
spoofing is a problem okay but now it's

1084
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,560
more fragile and more brittle and you

1085
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:18,240
just this keeps repeating we're not

1086
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:19,520
doing uh

1087
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:23,040
we're not doing um what is it uh

1088
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:26,560
icmp redirects we're not doing

1089
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:28,800
a lot of protocols have been locked down

1090
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,880
but they were done by the engineers

1091
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:32,400
trying to build a more secure internet

1092
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:34,079
and they are not the politicians and

1093
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:36,160
they're not the private sector

1094
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:38,000
and what's happening i think is we're

1095
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,440
going to wake up one day in the private

1096
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:42,400
sector the regulators are going to say

1097
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:44,240
how come there's one organization that

1098
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:46,079
can shut down routing

1099
00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:47,599
for the internet

1100
00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:49,760
that's not how we intended that to

1101
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:51,359
happen but the engineers are going to be

1102
00:39:51,359 --> 00:39:53,040
like well nobody asked us we're

1103
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:55,359
just trying to make a better technology

1104
00:39:55,359 --> 00:39:56,480
and that's what i fear is going to

1105
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:59,119
happen is that if the engineering class

1106
00:39:59,119 --> 00:40:01,040
that's developing these technologies are

1107
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:03,200
not getting information for their threat

1108
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:04,079
model

1109
00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:05,200
they're just going to be making the

1110
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:08,000
decisions purely on a technical basis

1111
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,240
they're not making it on the basis of a

1112
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:11,440
political

1113
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:14,400
twitter impact to society or a russian

1114
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:17,200
interference or regulation competition

1115
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:19,040
power power of competition in the

1116
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:20,880
european union

1117
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:24,000
that's going to be a big problem for us

1118
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,280
and

1119
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:27,040
this sanctions conversation we talked

1120
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:28,480
about briefly

1121
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:30,800
it's a crisis where you see some like

1122
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:33,359
some standards bodies say we thought

1123
00:40:33,359 --> 00:40:35,280
about this and we decided as engineers

1124
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:37,680
that it's not our problem

1125
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:40,160
oh well it's going to be your problem

1126
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:42,160
if you don't accept it

1127
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:43,839
and so i'd love to hear other people's

1128
00:40:43,839 --> 00:40:46,079
other people's thoughts

1129
00:40:46,079 --> 00:40:47,440
well for one

1130
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:49,760
someone i'm not referring to anyone

1131
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:52,800
specifically but someone buying a social

1132
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:54,240
media company

1133
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:56,160
so that they can run pump and dump

1134
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:57,760
schemes freely

1135
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:00,480
and destroying western democracies in

1136
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:04,319
the process is the most cyberpunk thing

1137
00:41:04,319 --> 00:41:06,800
i've ever heard of so thanks for the

1138
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:07,920
question

1139
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:09,599
um and

1140
00:41:09,599 --> 00:41:12,240
the the thing that you described is is

1141
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:13,839
absolutely what we were talking about

1142
00:41:13,839 --> 00:41:15,760
before about governance right the

1143
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:17,599
internet governance is

1144
00:41:17,599 --> 00:41:22,079
kind of a technocrat detached from the

1145
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:23,119
real

1146
00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:26,160
world of politics

1147
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:27,440
process

1148
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:30,880
and that's why it has worked so far

1149
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:32,880
right because it hasn't

1150
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:35,119
touched reality it has brought us this

1151
00:41:35,119 --> 00:41:37,440
thus far but this but now we are

1152
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:39,839
intersecting with reality and and

1153
00:41:39,839 --> 00:41:41,920
clashes are going to occur

1154
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:44,480
um you mentioned one i will mention

1155
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:45,599
another

1156
00:41:45,599 --> 00:41:48,560
uh what happens if and

1157
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:50,560
they're going to do this over mine and i

1158
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:52,000
could speak with a number of other dead

1159
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,920
bodies but they are going to do this the

1160
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:56,800
european commission decides

1161
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:58,319
that

1162
00:41:58,319 --> 00:41:59,680
scanning

1163
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:03,200
private messages is so important

1164
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:05,599
that it needs to be guaranteed

1165
00:42:05,599 --> 00:42:09,119
and when decryption be damned

1166
00:42:09,119 --> 00:42:11,440
and

1167
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:13,440
that that's that's that puts the

1168
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:14,880
government in the middle of every

1169
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:18,480
conversation that kind of does right

1170
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:20,880
and and we're going to try and explain

1171
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:22,880
it to them but given our rate of a

1172
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:24,480
success and explaining to them the

1173
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:26,720
implications of asana and explaining to

1174
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:28,560
them the implication of the digital

1175
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:30,400
services directive and

1176
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:32,880

1177
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:34,880
i'm not very hopeful that we are going

1178
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:37,200
to be able to explain this so

1179
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:38,240
um

1180
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:41,119
but in in we as engineers we can look at

1181
00:42:41,119 --> 00:42:42,880
that and say which is what we have done

1182
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:45,200
for a number of years well this does not

1183
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:46,880
make sense this is never going to happen

1184
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:48,319
so you can write it into law but it's

1185
00:42:48,319 --> 00:42:49,920
not going to happen well guess what they

1186
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:51,280
still write it in the law they are still

1187
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:54,000
writing it into law and so one way or

1188
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
another that's going to impact us so we

1189
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,119
would better

1190
00:42:57,119 --> 00:43:00,400
start talking to these people or

1191
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:02,000
actually as you did

1192
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,599
um try to

1193
00:43:03,599 --> 00:43:06,560
help yeah in in i think the service the

1194
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:08,319
biggest phrases is that you don't

1195
00:43:08,319 --> 00:43:10,240
collect it if you can't protect it that

1196
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:12,560
sort of mentality right like and i

1197
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:14,960
always think engineers being engineers

1198
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:16,480
are going to engineer themselves out of

1199
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:17,920
the problem and if you look at what

1200
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:19,440
apple tried to do

1201
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:21,520
they just said well we don't have the

1202
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:23,359
data because we end it and encrypted it

1203
00:43:23,359 --> 00:43:24,720
and we don't have the key and it's not

1204
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:26,800
our problem we don't need 5 000 lawyers

1205
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:29,440
and we are going to court in order to

1206
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:31,359
make sure that it doesn't become our

1207
00:43:31,359 --> 00:43:32,880
problem right our business model is not

1208
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:34,880
to hire 5 000 lawyers to answer law

1209
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:36,480
enforcement requests we don't have the

1210
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:38,720
data but if companies don't start

1211
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:41,280
engineering their products

1212
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:42,960
engineering themselves out of the

1213
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:44,560
problem you're going to be in the middle

1214
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:47,040
of every single one of these debates

1215
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:49,119
right if twitter

1216
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:52,319
you're just in the middle of it all

1217
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:54,079
how does undisclosed financial

1218
00:43:54,079 --> 00:43:56,000
corporation feel about being in the

1219
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
middle of it all you don't want to right

1220
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:02,319
you want to provide financial services

1221
00:44:02,319 --> 00:44:03,920
okay any other questions we'll take one

1222
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:06,480
more question

1223
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:11,520
come on i like the cyberpunk questions

1224
00:44:18,079 --> 00:44:21,200
hello i'm lover from dom dog security

1225
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:22,960
and my question is related to the

1226
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:25,280
sanctions on china russia because it was

1227
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:27,760
not just on the russian government a lot

1228
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:29,680
of utilitarian services were cut off for

1229
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:32,079
the russian people right so how do you

1230
00:44:32,079 --> 00:44:33,680
think countries will now do threat

1231
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:36,240
modeling going forward about even

1232
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:38,160
reliance on you know services from

1233
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:39,599
potentially you know there would be

1234
00:44:39,599 --> 00:44:41,119
friendly countries today right which is

1235
00:44:41,119 --> 00:44:43,440
largely western countries but could turn

1236
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:44,720
different tomorrow which could affect

1237
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:46,960
even functioning of the countries right

1238
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:48,480
so just threat modeling at a country

1239
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:50,480
level you know going based on what has

1240
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:52,800
happened with russia

1241
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:57,119
i'll refer to the european citizen

1242
00:44:59,119 --> 00:45:00,960
look go european

1243
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:01,760
um

1244
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:05,119
i don't i don't know so uh the the the

1245
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:07,200
the point is actually excellent and uh

1246
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:09,200
um

1247
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:10,560
what i think

1248
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:13,440
is uh is happening is that so

1249
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:14,720
there was a

1250
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:17,280
a memo that was circulated and widely

1251
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:19,599
means translated from the russian

1252
00:45:19,599 --> 00:45:21,200
government

1253
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:23,200
basically saying to

1254
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:25,680
their service providers

1255
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:28,079
look you should plan for being cut off

1256
00:45:28,079 --> 00:45:30,880
from the internet because at some point

1257
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:33,119
other countries are going to use that as

1258
00:45:33,119 --> 00:45:34,960
one of the sanctions it doesn't really

1259
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:36,720
happen that much but

1260
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:39,119
it it goes in that direction and and i

1261
00:45:39,119 --> 00:45:40,960
think that

1262
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:42,880
on the one hand

1263
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:44,240
there is

1264
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:47,520
basically no way at the moment

1265
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:49,599
that the country can really plan for

1266
00:45:49,599 --> 00:45:50,800
that

1267
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:53,839
or be resilient to that

1268
00:45:53,839 --> 00:45:57,520
and on the other hand

1269
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:01,359
we never engineered the internet

1270
00:46:01,359 --> 00:46:03,440
governance

1271
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:05,200
so that

1272
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:10,640
doing this would be really impossible

1273
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:14,680
and maybe that was a mistake

1274
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:18,240
all right

1275
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:19,839
with those deep thoughts

1276
00:46:19,839 --> 00:46:22,240
we are bringing to a close the loch no

1277
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:24,640
session

1278
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:26,800
black cat all right thank you everyone

1279
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:28,240
we'll be around we can answer questions

1280
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:29,280
we're going to go to the reception

1281
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:30,720
across the hall

1282
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:32,720
and with that thank you very much

1283
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:36,040
see you tomorrow

1284
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:39,230

00:46:43,080 --> 00:46:43,760
[Music]

1286
