[Music]

2
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:10,080
first of all i want to thank you all for

3
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:12,230
attending this talk

4
00:00:12,230 --> 00:00:13,440
[Music]

5
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:14,920
and let's

6
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:18,160
start so this talk is based on a

7
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:21,279
research that was ordered by myself by

8
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:24,080
la suissa by professor yuval alovich and

9
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:26,240
by dr boris

10
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:28,000
this work was done at the bengal

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,560
university of canada

12
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:34,719
and this is the agenda for today we will

13
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:36,559
start with a small introduction we'll

14
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:38,399
then review the background the needed

15
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:41,120
background to understand the attack

16
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:43,360
we will review the fret model we will

17
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:45,440
see some interesting experiments that we

18
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:47,280
did in the analysis

19
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:48,879
we will then discuss on how to recover

20
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:51,360
speech from optical measurements

21
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:52,879
we will see

22
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:55,840
and hear hopefully

23
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:57,600
nice speech recoveries from various

24
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:58,879
devices

25
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:01,280
and we will end up with takeaways

26
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:03,840
discuss the limitations and hopefully we

27
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:06,879
have some time for q a

28
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:11,200
okay so let's start with the question

29
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:13,360
and what do you know regarding the

30
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:16,000
picture presented on the right side of

31
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,479
the screen

32
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:20,640
okay so here are

33
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,799
a few interesting facts

34
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:25,040
the first fact is that as you can see it

35
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:27,600
is a picture of an eagle

36
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:28,479
and

37
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:30,159
another fact is that

38
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:32,159
this picture was given

39
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:33,600
as a gift

40
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,680
to the united states ambassador to the

41
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:38,720
to the soviet union at the end of world

42
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:41,360
war ii they actually received it as a

43
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:44,159
gift from the soviets

44
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:46,640
and it looks very nice if you observe it

45
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:49,280
from the outside but if if you

46
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,880
examine it

47
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,079
internally

48
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:54,000
you will find that it contained a

49
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,159
concealed passive device

50
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:58,320
uh which is considered the predecessor

51
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:01,200
of the lfid technology

52
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,240
which was used for speedchip stopping

53
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,719
and it was the first known

54
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:09,360
covert listening device that utilized

55
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,120
passive techniques

56
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,520
and it took the americans about six

57
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,520
years to determine

58
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:18,400
its real purpose

59
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,959
and maybe some of you are more familiar

60
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:23,120
with its name it was named the great

61
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,640
seal bug

62
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,879
or maybe more commonly known as the

63
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:29,120
thing

64
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:33,280
now just before we will i will ask you

65
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,959
another question i want you to have a

66
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:36,560
look on the picture

67
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:39,120
on the right side of the screen

68
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,519
as you can see these are a very

69
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:44,160
interesting type of objects they're all

70
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,560
passive unaltered

71
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,120
shiny and lightweight

72
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,840
and you can see that there is uh an uh

73
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,239
an empty uh beverage can

74
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:55,440
uh

75
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:58,160
a regular smartphone stand and several

76
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:00,800
uh desktop ornaments that usually are

77
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:04,000
placed on desktop for the collection

78
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,239
and here is a question for you

79
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:09,200
can eavesdroppers exploit this type of

80
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:12,000
objects which are passive unaltered

81
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,400
shiny and lightweight

82
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,959
as optical implants for the purpose of

83
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:19,360
the speech if stopping

84
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,040
now i will start with the short answer

85
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,640
so the answer

86
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:24,400
the short answer to this question is yes

87
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,640
and throughout this talk i will try to

88
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,680
show you how how exactly

89
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:30,560
and

90
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,480
just to give you uh

91
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:35,200
just for you to see this is an example

92
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,440
for the type of objects that we are

93
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:38,799
speaking of

94
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:41,040
okay again a passive

95
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,680
shiny and lightweight objects that

96
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:44,799
reflect

97
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:47,799
light

98
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,239
and throughout this stock we name

99
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:52,799
this type of objects as

100
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:54,319
little seal bugs okay they are

101
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:57,200
lightweight shiny objects which reflects

102
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,840
light

103
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:01,680
and let's review the needed background

104
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,120
before we will dive into the

105
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,640
understanding the nature of the attack

106
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,799
and for doing so i will let us to

107
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:09,519
continue from here

108
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,840
thank you ben hi everyone i will take it

109
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,079
from here

110
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:21,199
so first of all according to wikipedia

111
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:22,800
eavesdropping is the act of secretly

112
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,720
recovering sound from a target or a

113
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:28,800
victim without his or her consent

114
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,919
so there are two main ways to apply

115
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:33,520
sound eavesdropping

116
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:36,960
the first of them is tempest attacks

117
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:39,440
tempest attacks are methods that rely on

118
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,919
a leakage from a device and required to

119
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:44,800
obtain data using a dedicated sensor and

120
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,479
explore the correlation

121
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:49,360
between sound processed by the device

122
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:52,000
and the device's leakage

123
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,400
the main disadvantage of such attacks

124
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,560
tempest attacks is that they are limited

125
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,560
at recovering speech only from virtual

126
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,400
meetings

127
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,560
the second type of attack is

128
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,720
m side channel attacks

129
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:07,840
such an attacks are methods that exploit

130
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,840
lightweight objects as vibrating

131
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:11,280
diaphragms

132
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,840
and required to obtain data using a

133
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:16,240
dedicated sensor and exploit the

134
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,160
correlation between the movement of the

135
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,120
object

136
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:22,479
and the sound played near them

137
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:24,400
but what's different here is that side

138
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,320
channel attacks can be used to recover

139
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:29,199
sound both from physical conversation

140
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:29,919
and

141
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:33,039
virtual conversations

142
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,880
the little seal bug attack is an

143
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,800
additional implementation of a office

144
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,120
side channel attack that exclu that that

145
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,360
exploits lightweight objects as the air

146
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,759
force

147
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,360
and now we'll discuss some eavesdropping

148
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,039
related research

149
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:50,880
so first of all in research in recent

150
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,960
years the scientific community has

151
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:56,080
suggested various ways to recover sound

152
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,000
and we are going to divide those ways

153
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,520
into two categories

154
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,680
so the first categories is the first

155
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,919
category is internal methods and the

156
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:06,400
second category is external methods we

157
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,919
are going to first discuss internal

158
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:09,919
methods

159
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:12,160
so internal methods are methods that

160
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,400
rely on data obtained by a device

161
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,880
located in proximity to the victim

162
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,639
in other words in the same room with the

163
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:20,479
victim

164
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:22,319
and in recent years we've seen

165
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:24,240
scientists exploit

166
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,720
motion sensors speakers

167
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,199
vibration sensor vibration sensors which

168
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:32,319
are all integrated into smartphones

169
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:34,800
and to eavesdrop on sound using data

170
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,039
obtained from them

171
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:39,039
in addition some scientists have

172
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:41,039
exploited data obtained from a magnetic

173
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:43,199
hard drive to recover one sound twist

174
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:46,319
open sound on speech

175
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:49,039
and if i have to summarize this internal

176
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:51,280
methods i will say that the main

177
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,720
advantage

178
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,720
is that they are permissionless

179
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,800
which means applications that implement

180
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,479
this method do not require any

181
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:00,840
permission to obtain data from the

182
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:05,520
devices however these methods are

183
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,360
the biggest disadvantage is that they

184
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,360
require the attacker to place a

185
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,599
compromised device near the victim to

186
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:14,479
obtain the data required

187
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:16,080
now we're going to discuss the external

188
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,319
methods external methods are methods

189
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:21,759
that relate on data obtained by device

190
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:23,680
that is located that is not located near

191
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:24,319
the

192
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:26,000
victim

193
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,840
so the most

194
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,599
famous external method that we know

195
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:30,880
today is

196
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,479
the laser microphone

197
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:34,800
which uses a laser transceiver to

198
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,599
recover sound by directing laser on an

199
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:38,639
object

200
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:40,400
and analyzing the object's response to

201
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,160
the sound

202
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,560
laser microphone's biggest advantages is

203
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,479
that first of all it's external

204
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:48,639
and which means it does not require any

205
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:52,319
to place any malware near the victim

206
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:54,639
and second of second of all it can be

207
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:56,479
applied in real time

208
00:07:56,479 --> 00:07:58,720
however this method is active which

209
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,400
means the laser the laser beam can be

210
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:03,599
detected by the victim if he just uses

211
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:06,879
any dedicated optical sensor

212
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:08,319
the next method we are gonna we are

213
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:11,280
gonna discuss is the visual microphone

214
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,720
the visual microphone is an attack that

215
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,639
was suggested by a group of scientists

216
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:17,199
in mit 8 years ago

217
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:18,960
and this group actually suggested that

218
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,639
they can use a high frequency video

219
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:21,680
camera

220
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,360
to recover sound by analyzing the

221
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,599
object's response to sound

222
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:27,440
they show that they can analyze the

223
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:30,000
vibrations on a bag of chips to cover

224
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,958
the sound play near this bag of chips

225
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:34,640
so this method's greatest greatest

226
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,559
advantages is that first of all again

227
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:39,200
it's external and it's passive

228
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:42,399
making it actually harder for a victim

229
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:43,919
to detect this attack

230
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:46,480
because of its passiveness

231
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,640
however this method cannot be applied in

232
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:51,200
real time because it requires a lot of

233
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,680
computational resources to reconstruct

234
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:56,880
just few seconds of sound

235
00:08:57,279 --> 00:08:58,800
the next and last method we are going to

236
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,640
discuss now in this section is length

237
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:03,200
which uses a photodiode to recover sound

238
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:03,839
and

239
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:05,839
sound by analyzing it and light bulbs

240
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:08,720
vibration in response to the sound

241
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:11,120
in this method we can see that it has

242
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:13,279
more advantages compared to the other

243
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:14,800
because first of all again

244
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,240
it's external

245
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,320
it's passive and this time it can be

246
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,920
applied in real time

247
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,519
which makes it fast and easy to recover

248
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:24,800
sound after obtaining the data required

249
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,720
however length phones require an

250
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:29,279
uncommon object in the victim's room

251
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:32,480
which may not be there

252
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:34,880
so in general if i have to summarize

253
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,399
this whole section of

254
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:39,120
of related work i will say that each of

255
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,720
their methods or attacks that i have

256
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,640
shown you today is limited by one of the

257
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,480
following aspects

258
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,080
some of them relies on remotely

259
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,240
controlled device which makes the vic

260
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,160
there is dropper must compromise the

261
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:52,320
device near the victim

262
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,320
some of them are active which makes it

263
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,720
easier to the victim to detect the

264
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,480
use of the method

265
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,000
some of them cannot be applied in real

266
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,920
time which makes it

267
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:04,399
harder much harder to obtain the data

268
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:06,000
have to recover the sound after

269
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,519
obtaining the data

270
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:09,360
and some of them relies on an

271
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:12,959
uncommon object in the victim zone

272
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,959
and so that's it with the related work

273
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:16,720
and let's move to the little silbux

274
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,959
state model

275
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:20,720
so first of all in the little big in the

276
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,720
little seal back there model we assume

277
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,720
that the victim makes the call or attend

278
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,880
the meeting from an office or a room

279
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:29,200
that contains a little seal bag

280
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,839
and in the form of a lightweight shiny

281
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:33,760
object second we assume that the sound

282
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,360
that form the victim's conversation

283
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,600
conversation hits the surface of the

284
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:40,480
object and creates fluctuations on it

285
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,320
and the object is obviously aligned with

286
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,640
any object that is placed on the desk in

287
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,560
the room

288
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,320
in addition we assume that there's an

289
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,600
eavesdropper

290
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,760
the stopper that directs a photodiode at

291
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:53,360
the lightweight shiny object via

292
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,959
telescope

293
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:56,800
the optical signal is sampled from the

294
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:59,279
photodiode via an a2d

295
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:01,040
after that an algorithm is used to

296
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,640
recover the acoustic signal from the

297
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:05,360
optical signal

298
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:07,760
and if we want to summarize the

299
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,680
advantages and advantages of the little

300
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,680
sailback attack in comparison to the

301
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,600
other attacks i've shown you today

302
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,279
we can see that first of all it's

303
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:16,959
external

304
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:18,240
it's passive

305
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,160
it can be applied in real time

306
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:23,120
and in addition it's based on

307
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:26,800
on more commonly used objects

308
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,399
now i'm gonna let ben analyze the

309
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:30,079
physical phenomenon of that associated

310
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:33,599
with the little seal bag attack

311
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,480
okay thank you so let's review the

312
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,480
needed

313
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:45,279
science behind how to uh basically and

314
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:46,240
why

315
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,480
the attack actually works so

316
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:51,279
first of all we did uh i want to

317
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:53,680
convince you that any lightweight object

318
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:56,240
that you take is actually vibrates

319
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:58,399
according to the sound played near uh

320
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:00,800
near near it and in order to do so we

321
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:03,519
conducted an experiment where we took

322
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:07,120
a shiny weight okay about 50 grams

323
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:10,000
and we connected away to a gyroscope

324
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,839
that was also connected

325
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:14,079
to a raspberry pi 3 you can see it on

326
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:15,920
the right side

327
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:18,639
the raspberry pi was used to obtain data

328
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:20,240
from the gyroscope

329
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,800
now we play the frequency scan uh in the

330
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,320
spectrum of uh

331
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:27,360
200 hertz to 1500 hertz uh from the

332
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:30,000
speakers uh which were placed about 10

333
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,560
centimeters from the weight at a volume

334
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:35,920
level of 75 db

335
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,560
and here you can see

336
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:42,639
a spectrogram that was extracted from

337
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:45,360
the measurements of the gyroscope now

338
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:48,639
for those of you who can uh um

339
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:50,959
probably it's easier for you to see

340
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:53,600
the frequency scan and locate it and

341
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:54,880
see it

342
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:57,120
inside in the spectrogram

343
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,800
and this is actually proves that

344
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,959
lightweight objects

345
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:03,920
vibrate according to the sound played

346
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:04,839
near

347
00:13:04,839 --> 00:13:08,079
them okay now let's understand how this

348
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:11,440
thing can actually be captured optically

349
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,680
and in order to do so we conducted an

350
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:16,240
additional experiment uh we directed the

351
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:17,519
telescope

352
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:19,519
at the weight you can see the telescope

353
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:21,600
on the left side

354
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:24,000
now we mounted the photodiode

355
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,760
to the telescope

356
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,519
okay

357
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:30,880
and use an a2d to sample the photodiode

358
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:34,320
to sample the optical signal

359
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:37,920
now we played again a frequency scan um

360
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:41,279
between 100 hertz to 20 hundred to uh to

361
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:42,160
12

362
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:42,880
to

363
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:46,639
2000 to 2000 hertz via the speakers

364
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:49,200
which were placed about 10 centimeters

365
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,240
from the

366
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,600
from the weight

367
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:55,120
again at the sound level of 75 db

368
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:57,600
and we obtained the optical measurements

369
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:00,240
uh in three experimental setups

370
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,320
in the first experimental setup uh we

371
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,480
didn't change anything basically lights

372
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,639
in the room were on

373
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:08,800
in the second experimental setup

374
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:11,199
uh the weights were covered

375
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:12,000
with

376
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,240
a black tape

377
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:17,040
and in the third experimental setup we

378
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:19,519
uh turned off the light and as you can

379
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:20,560
see

380
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:22,639
no light was in the room nothing can be

381
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:25,120
seen from the telescope

382
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:25,920
okay

383
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:28,399
now let's see the results um

384
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:29,519
based on the measurements that were

385
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:31,199
obtained from each of these three

386
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:32,560
experiments

387
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:36,000
we computed the signal to noise ratio

388
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,560
okay now as you can see

389
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:41,279
uh the sound that was played near the

390
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:42,320
weight

391
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,399
can be recovered

392
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:46,480
uh from the experiment that was

393
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,720
conducted that was conducted when the

394
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,880
lights were on

395
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,720
and the weight

396
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:55,120
actually wasn't covered

397
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:57,279
in a black tape okay you can see how the

398
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:59,600
signal to noise ratio is positive this

399
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:02,880
is uh the picture in the middle

400
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,639
however as you can this is actually

401
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:07,680
corresponds to a risk for a

402
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:09,360
speech eavesdropping okay you can

403
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:12,639
recover sound that is played near on

404
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:14,560
near an object

405
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:16,800
however as you can also see

406
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:19,839
the risk of speeds of speech recovery to

407
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:22,079
a subject exists

408
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:23,440
only if

409
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:26,320
the lights in the room are on and the

410
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:29,760
nearby object reflects light

411
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:32,480
if one of these conditions

412
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,160
isn't satisfied

413
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:35,760
sound cannot be recovered and you can

414
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:38,240
see how there is a zero signal to noise

415
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:40,959
ratio in the two additional experiments

416
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:42,959
that were conducted when the lights were

417
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:43,760
off

418
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:46,800
and when the weight was covered

419
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:49,439
in black tape

420
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,240
now let's try to understand how to

421
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:54,320
isolate the sound from the optical

422
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,920
signal

423
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:56,639
and

424
00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:59,120
we actually recover

425
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:01,519
speech from the optical measurements

426
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:04,560
using the following steps

427
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,720
first we filter side effects

428
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,560
the optical signal even if you will

429
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:09,839
sample it

430
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:13,120
without any uh you know a sound

431
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:15,440
near an object

432
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:17,519
consists of various uh

433
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:19,279
side effects that we want to

434
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:20,720
to filter out

435
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:23,440
for example you can see uh how harmonics

436
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,040
of 100 hertz

437
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:27,040
appear in the spectrum of

438
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:29,600
the optical signal which is uh by the

439
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,759
way the result of the way that the bulb

440
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:33,440
is working

441
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,680
so we actually filter these frequencies

442
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:37,759
on desired frequencies or undesired side

443
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:42,480
effects with using bend stock filters

444
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:45,279
next we normalize the signal normalizing

445
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:47,279
is a technique which is uh used in the

446
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:49,680
area of

447
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:52,320
of speech

448
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,160
in order to enhance

449
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:55,839
the speech

450
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:57,839
in the signal and we normalize the

451
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:00,079
signal to the range of minus one and one

452
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:02,560
and you can see at the bottom the effect

453
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:05,839
of normalizing the signal

454
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,079
and we also

455
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:11,839
apply some noise reduction techniques um

456
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:14,079
there are various ways to uh in various

457
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:15,679
noise reduction techniques that can be

458
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:16,720
used

459
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:20,160
we actually use spectral subtraction

460
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:22,079
uh spectral subtraction is an adaptive

461
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:25,520
technique that is used to denoise uh um

462
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,359
single channel speech

463
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:30,000
and the primary advantage of this uh

464
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,640
technique is the fact that it

465
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:35,200
doesn't rely on any prior knowledge or

466
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,600
it doesn't make any assumptions

467
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:40,240
uh regarding the distribution of the

468
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:41,919
measurements regarding distribution of

469
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:44,400
the noise

470
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:47,600
and finally we also use an equalizer

471
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:48,400
um

472
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:51,280
we use an equalizer to balance between

473
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,840
the response of the frequencies

474
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:54,960
um

475
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:57,919
in some cases uh there's a weak response

476
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:00,559
in some cases there is a good response

477
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:02,559
an equalizer is used to balance between

478
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:04,880
the responses of the components

479
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,559
of the frequencies

480
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:07,440
of

481
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:10,080
the signal

482
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:13,039
okay now let's uh

483
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:18,000
go to uh and see the evaluation

484
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,360
and

485
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:20,400
first of all i want to show the

486
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,799
experimental setup that was used for uh

487
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:24,640
for the next experiments that you're

488
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:25,840
about to see

489
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:27,760
we actually use the telescope as you can

490
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,320
see on the left side again we mounted a

491
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:31,600
photodiode

492
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,520
to the telescope

493
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:36,240
the telescope was directed to these

494
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,240
five nice objects

495
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:39,600
that you can see

496
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:40,480
on

497
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,160
the bottom of the screen there is

498
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,760
smartphones there there is an empty

499
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:45,120
beverage can

500
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:46,000
um

501
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,280
and there are

502
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:49,360
there are two um

503
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:51,520
desktop ornaments and as you can see

504
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:56,360
there is a shiny rubik's cube

505
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:59,200
now um

506
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,480
the first demonstration that you are

507
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:01,600
about to see

508
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:02,880
um

509
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:05,679
we played two sine waves which uh

510
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:09,280
basically were 280 and 380 hertz from

511
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:10,720
the speakers

512
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:13,440
one sine wave at each time and i want to

513
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,440
show you how it looks like in out the

514
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:18,720
script that we wrote in real time now in

515
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,640
the left side you can see the script

516
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,400
that we wrote and you're about to see

517
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,520
how peaks

518
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:26,559
appear exactly in 280 hertz and 380

519
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:28,879
hertz

520
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:31,120
okay you can see how the peaks are

521
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:36,439
actually changing between 280 and 380.

522
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,960
okay so as you all know uh

523
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:43,280
the distance from recovering a single

524
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:45,520
sine wave to speech

525
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:46,880
is quite high

526
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:48,160
um

527
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:50,559
is quite long and i want to show you

528
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:52,240
some recoveries of the speech that we

529
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:53,200
made

530
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,320
now

531
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:56,000
we actually compared the results of the

532
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,520
little c bug to uh two known methods the

533
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:02,400
first method is the visual microphone

534
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,160
and we evaluated the little seal bug

535
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:07,360
attack under the same experimental setup

536
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:09,280
of visual microphone

537
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:10,240
now

538
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:13,200
raz mentioned at the beginning uh

539
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:15,520
the research of the that was named the

540
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:17,200
visual microphone

541
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:19,520
the visual microphone was presented

542
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:22,400
about eight years ago by a group of

543
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:25,039
researchers from mit

544
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:27,840
and they demonstrated speech recovery by

545
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:29,760
analyzing the vibrations of a bag of

546
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:30,640
chips

547
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:33,440
using a very high frequency video camera

548
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:36,559
okay a camera that able to produce more

549
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:41,679
than two thousands of frames per second

550
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:43,200
and

551
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,280
we actually replicated the experimental

552
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:48,080
setup used in the visual microphone

553
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,919
and we did it as follows

554
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:52,400
we placed the speakers on a dedicated

555
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:53,440
stand

556
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:55,919
five centimeters from various shiny

557
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:57,280
objects the objects that they showed at

558
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:58,559
the beginning

559
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:01,520
and we played the same six sentences

560
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:04,080
from timid repository which was used

561
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:04,960
also

562
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,159
by the guys

563
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:06,960
that

564
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:09,520
presented the visual microphone

565
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,360
in this case we used the same amount of

566
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:13,280
volume that they used which is

567
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:16,559
corresponds to 95 db 95 db is very high

568
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:18,880
it is much more than the uh the the

569
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:20,640
volume that i'm currently speaking it

570
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:23,360
corresponds to screaming

571
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:26,640
and we place the sloping equipment about

572
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,240
two and a half meters from the

573
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:31,039
lightweight reflective object

574
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:32,240
now

575
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:34,480
um as you can see in here

576
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:35,360
uh

577
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,120
these are the spectrograms that were

578
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:39,679
obtained from the original sentence and

579
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:41,200
that were obtained from the optical

580
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,320
measurements

581
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:44,799
that were obtained from the various

582
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:46,320
objects that were used

583
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:48,799
uh for this experiment and as you can

584
00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:51,760
see the quality of the original uh

585
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:54,960
sentence um is at much higher quality

586
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:58,000
than uh than the than the recoveries

587
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,400
however i want to prove to you that the

588
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,400
signals that were recovered by the

589
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,960
leadership back attack are at very good

590
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:07,280
quality so you will be able to hear them

591
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:09,840
so i'm about to play to you the the

592
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:12,400
signals in order to to present them to

593
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,080
you bear in mind that at the beginning

594
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:16,480
you will hear the original signal and

595
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:18,080
afterwards you will see

596
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:19,679
you will hear the

597
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:23,520
recoveries from various devices

598
00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:27,600
she had your dark suit greasy wash water

599
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:30,840
all year

600
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:35,099
[Music]

601
00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:45,520
okay so bear in mind this was recovered

602
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:47,600
from optical measurements basically from

603
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:48,720
light

604
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:50,400
um the next thing that i want to show

605
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:53,200
you is an additional recovery which is

606
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:57,039
very interesting in my opinion

607
00:22:57,039 --> 00:22:59,280
the next sentence or the next recovery

608
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:00,720
was done

609
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:03,520
by analyzing light reflected from

610
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:06,880
venetian blinds

611
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:11,210
[Music]

612
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:14,640
okay hopefully you were able to hear it

613
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:16,159
and

614
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:17,679
take into account that the initial

615
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:19,280
blinds

616
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:22,080
are basically a piece of equipment that

617
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:23,520
is intended

618
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:24,799
to increase

619
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:26,960
a subject's privacy

620
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:29,280
however since they share the same

621
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,840
characteristics of being lightweight and

622
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:32,960
shiny

623
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,720
they can be exploited

624
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:36,640
to recover speech

625
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:39,600
from a subject okay basically uh risking

626
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,600
the privacy of a subject rather than

627
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:45,439
increasing the privacy of a subject

628
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:47,840
now interestingly

629
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:49,600
the little seal bug attack is capable of

630
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:52,240
recovering speech in real time at the

631
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:55,280
same quality of as a visual microphone

632
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:56,159
um

633
00:23:56,159 --> 00:23:59,520
it is highly depends on

634
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:03,280
the object that is being used to recover

635
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:05,919
speech but as you can see the the speech

636
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:08,559
recovery is very high uh quality where

637
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:10,720
you can hear it and understand what is

638
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:13,200
being said

639
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:15,600
now um

640
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:17,679
the main disadvantage of

641
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:18,400
the

642
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,159
previous uh

643
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:22,320
experiment that we did was that the fact

644
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:24,720
that it's not exactly practical because

645
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:26,640
the entire experimental setup was done

646
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:30,000
at 95 db at a range which corresponds to

647
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,400
about five centimeters from uh between

648
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:33,600
the object

649
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:36,320
and the speaker so uh

650
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:39,120
in order to compare the results of the

651
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:42,080
little seal bug to uh

652
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:44,720
another attack that is somehow more

653
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:46,400
with more reasonable experimental setup

654
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,559
and more reasonable threat model uh we

655
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:50,320
decided to compare

656
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:52,240
uh the results or basically the

657
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:54,320
performance of the little seal bag

658
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:57,039
attack to landform

659
00:24:57,039 --> 00:24:58,720
and we evaluated the leader seal back

660
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:00,480
attack under the same experimental setup

661
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:01,840
that was used

662
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:03,279
in length

663
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:05,760
and a quick reminder regarding length on

664
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:08,159
uh lymphoma was presented

665
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:10,880
in black 2020 by by me

666
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:13,279
by our group basically

667
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:14,880
two years ago

668
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,960
and we demonstrated

669
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:18,559
speech recovery

670
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:21,200
by analyzing the vibrations of hanging

671
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:24,159
light bulb using a photodiode

672
00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:25,919
okay so

673
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:27,760
again we replicated the same

674
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:31,120
experimental setup used uh in length

675
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:32,080
study

676
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:33,279
as follows

677
00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:34,720
we place

678
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:37,360
the equipment basically the telescope

679
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:40,240
in the photodiode at various distances

680
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:42,080
you can see that the distances in this

681
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:46,400
case uh the rise between 15 25 and 35

682
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:48,799
meters

683
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:50,880
and the speakers were placed at a

684
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:53,840
distance of 25 centimeters from the

685
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:55,520
reflective objects

686
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:58,480
okay now please take into account that

687
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:01,360
standard desk depth is about 60

688
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:03,840
centimeters so basically we are you're

689
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:06,000
about to see a demonstration or

690
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,400
recoveries that were made when

691
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:12,080
um the objects were placed at about half

692
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:14,640
of the depth from the speaker

693
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:15,919
okay

694
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:19,440
which is 25 centimeters uh

695
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:21,840
and we played a statement made by former

696
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:23,760
president donald trump

697
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:26,000
via the speakers

698
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,640
in this case uh we played it at the

699
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:31,039
volume level of a virtual meeting which

700
00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:33,600
is about 75 db

701
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,840
and

702
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:39,120
here you can see the the spectral the

703
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:40,880
spectrograms that were obtained from the

704
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:43,440
original statement and the recovered

705
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:44,640
statement

706
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:46,960
in this case from the rubik's cube

707
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:49,360
you are about to hear it uh you can see

708
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:52,320
how the you can even spot it in the uh

709
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:54,559
spectrograms how the quality uh

710
00:26:54,559 --> 00:26:58,159
decreases with distance okay the it is

711
00:26:58,159 --> 00:27:02,080
uh the the quality of the signal at 15

712
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:04,480
meters is better than the quality of the

713
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:08,000
signal it's 35 meters but again i would

714
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,039
i would like to show you that

715
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:13,520
the signals that are recovered

716
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:16,159
using the little seal bug attack

717
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:18,400
are perceptible and you can hear and

718
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:20,480
understand what is being said so

719
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:22,159
again you will hear the original

720
00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:23,760
sentence and then the recovery is from

721
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:28,480
15 meters 25 meters and 35 meters when

722
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:29,440
uh

723
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:31,360
the distance between the object and the

724
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:35,840
speakers what was about 25 centimeters

725
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:42,230
we will make america great again

726
00:27:42,230 --> 00:27:45,349
[Music]

727
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:54,230
[Music]

728
00:27:56,480 --> 00:28:01,039
okay so uh as you can understand uh

729
00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:05,039
and basically can hear the sentences uh

730
00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:07,120
you can understand what is being said by

731
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:09,760
and you can identify the speaker as well

732
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:10,799
um

733
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:12,399
let's review the limitations of the

734
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:14,080
attack

735
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:15,520
now

736
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:17,600
the leader seal bug attack required the

737
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:21,760
attacker to be uh located in physical

738
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:23,840
radius or proximity

739
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:26,240
from the victim okay 35 meters is

740
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,640
considered a remote attack but it's not

741
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:31,279
exactly an over the internet attack okay

742
00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:33,120
it's not a virtual attack where you can

743
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:36,880
apply from another state

744
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:38,000
also

745
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,640
um the attack is not exactly

746
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:42,000
easy to apply

747
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,240
it requires some understanding in dsp

748
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:46,399
and i would say that the you know the uh

749
00:28:46,399 --> 00:28:49,520
the standout 16 years old uh hacker

750
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:51,840
probably won't be able to apply the

751
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:54,879
attack from an end to end

752
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,320
also the quality of the recovery speech

753
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:00,720
is proportional to the quality of the

754
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:03,440
equipment used and when i

755
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:05,120
refer to the equipment i refer to the

756
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:06,240
a2d

757
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:08,880
to the telescope and the photodiode that

758
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:13,279
are used to sample the optical signal um

759
00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:15,440
it goes like this if you will spend more

760
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:17,600
money on the equipment

761
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:20,399
uh you in you will you will be able to

762
00:29:20,399 --> 00:29:21,440
produce

763
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:25,120
speech or recoveries at a higher quality

764
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:28,080
um this is a limitation however bear in

765
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:30,320
mind that probably uh

766
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:32,960
resources or money

767
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:34,799
is not a limitation or it's not a real

768
00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:37,200
limitation for the parties that might

769
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:38,080
apply

770
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:41,600
this type of attack

771
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:45,200
now finally uh light deteriorates with

772
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,399
distance

773
00:29:46,399 --> 00:29:48,880
um which basically means that this

774
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:51,600
attack have some physical limitation

775
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:55,840
uh which affected by various factors

776
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:58,960
and this is it

777
00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:00,880
now let's review the takeaways for this

778
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,799
talk

779
00:30:02,799 --> 00:30:04,559
now the primary takeaway that i want you

780
00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:06,640
to take from this talk is that despite

781
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:08,559
the fact that this attack

782
00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:11,760
can be used to eavesdrop speech

783
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:13,200
you should be more concerned in my

784
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:15,520
opinion about methods to eavesdrop

785
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:18,399
speech via iot devices with an

786
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:21,679
integrated microphone and for example a

787
00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:25,279
smartphone a laptop an ip camera

788
00:30:25,279 --> 00:30:26,799
and a smartwatch

789
00:30:26,799 --> 00:30:28,960
are probably more risky in terms of

790
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,080
privacy

791
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:31,440
than

792
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:34,799
these devices or these objects which are

793
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:36,960
again it requires some understanding on

794
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,799
how to even apply this type of attacks

795
00:30:38,799 --> 00:30:39,600
while

796
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:40,880
um

797
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,399
in many cases

798
00:30:42,399 --> 00:30:45,120
these devices are much are very easy to

799
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:48,239
uh to compromise

800
00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:50,480
um

801
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:52,080
moreover

802
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:54,320
as you can understand many shiny

803
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:56,640
lightweight objects can serve

804
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:58,799
as optical implants that can be

805
00:30:58,799 --> 00:31:01,120
exploited by eavesdroppers to recover

806
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:02,080
speech

807
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:03,760
in some cases this is comp they are

808
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:06,880
completely innocent um objects like

809
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:09,039
desktop ornaments or

810
00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:11,440
a smartphone stand or an empty beverage

811
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:12,320
can

812
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:15,360
uh in some cases these are objects which

813
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:18,559
intended for the opposite uh purpose to

814
00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:19,600
increase

815
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:23,360
uh a prior a user's privacy like uh

816
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:25,360
the initial blinds um

817
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:27,039
all of these devices due to the fact

818
00:31:27,039 --> 00:31:29,120
that they share the same characteristics

819
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:32,159
being lightweight and shiny

820
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:34,720
can turn into optical implants when

821
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:37,039
there is a sufficient amount of light in

822
00:31:37,039 --> 00:31:39,440
the room

823
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:43,440
also interestingly the area of optical

824
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:45,600
speech eavesdropping has advanced

825
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:48,960
significantly in the last eight years

826
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:50,240
ever since

827
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:51,840
visual microphone

828
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:53,760
have presented a method to recover

829
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:54,720
speech

830
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:58,080
using a video camera

831
00:31:58,080 --> 00:31:59,679
for additional

832
00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:02,240
attacks uh were presented in the wild

833
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:04,559
most of them in the last two years um

834
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:06,960
the first one is landform where uh

835
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:08,559
demonstrated the ability to recover

836
00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:10,960
speech again using the photodiode by

837
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:13,279
analyzing the vibration

838
00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:15,200
of a hanging light bulb

839
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:17,279
to nearby sound

840
00:32:17,279 --> 00:32:19,279
the second is lidar phone

841
00:32:19,279 --> 00:32:21,360
which demonstrated how

842
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:25,440
a robotic vacuum a robotic

843
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:28,159
a robovac basically lidars can be

844
00:32:28,159 --> 00:32:29,679
exploited

845
00:32:29,679 --> 00:32:32,799
to classify isolated words

846
00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:34,399
and an additional attack that was

847
00:32:34,399 --> 00:32:36,880
presented last year was the glom attack

848
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:40,559
which have demonstrated how

849
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:43,919
speech can be recovered from

850
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:46,880
power leds of speakers again using a

851
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:49,760
photodiode by analyzing the intensity

852
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:53,200
of the power leds of the speakers

853
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:55,600
and the last attack was presented today

854
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:57,360
which is the latest bag attack where

855
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:59,600
again photodiode was used to recover

856
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:03,200
speech and we expect that more optical

857
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:05,600
eavesdropping methods that rely on

858
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:08,720
optical sensors uh will be demonstrated

859
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:09,760
in the next

860
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:12,240
few years

861
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:14,320
and also there are three interesting

862
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:16,159
facts that i want you to think of or to

863
00:33:16,159 --> 00:33:18,399
take into account first of all photo

864
00:33:18,399 --> 00:33:20,720
detectors are integrated into

865
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:23,039
i would say all of the smartphones

866
00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:26,000
nowadays each and every one of you

867
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,159
have a smartphone with an integrated

868
00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:30,080
photo detector

869
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:32,720
moreover smartphone manufacturers

870
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:35,440
continue to increase the sampling rate

871
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:37,760
of the integrated sensors in some

872
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:39,360
android devices

873
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:42,799
uh the sampling rate is currently around

874
00:33:42,799 --> 00:33:44,320
500 hertz

875
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:48,320
okay and bear in mind they continue to

876
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:51,200
the manufacturers continue to increase

877
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:53,760
the sampling rate over the years

878
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:55,519
and here is another interesting fact

879
00:33:55,519 --> 00:33:57,679
which is obtaining data from the photo

880
00:33:57,679 --> 00:33:59,519
detector

881
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:01,519
doesn't even require a user's permission

882
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:03,120
because it doesn't consider

883
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:06,720
as risky data which is associated with a

884
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:07,600
risk

885
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:10,560
to the privacy now all of these

886
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:12,480
effects alone

887
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:14,399
aren't very important or maybe aren't

888
00:34:14,399 --> 00:34:15,679
even risky

889
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:19,839
but combining these three facts together

890
00:34:19,839 --> 00:34:21,119
we might

891
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:22,879
see an implementation of a new type of

892
00:34:22,879 --> 00:34:24,079
malware

893
00:34:24,079 --> 00:34:26,159
and compromised applications

894
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:28,320
for speech eavesdropping

895
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:31,440
via smartphones light sensor

896
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:33,679
in the near future and again bear in

897
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:34,800
mind

898
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:37,119
currently your smartphones

899
00:34:37,119 --> 00:34:39,599
uh consist of a photo detector they

900
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:43,040
allow this sufficient um

901
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:45,679
sampling rate or probably gonna allow us

902
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:47,520
most efficient sampling rate in the next

903
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:48,480
few years

904
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:50,000
and also

905
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,480
obtaining this data doesn't even require

906
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:55,440
to declare about it in the manifest of

907
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:58,320
the applica of the android application

908
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:00,240
and with that in mind

909
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:01,680
i would like to thank you for attending

910
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:02,960
this talk

911
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:05,440
you can find more details

912
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:08,880
related to this talk in this website

913
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:09,760
and

914
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:11,680
we will take questions from the audience

915
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:14,839
thank you

916
00:35:21,330 --> 00:35:22,480
