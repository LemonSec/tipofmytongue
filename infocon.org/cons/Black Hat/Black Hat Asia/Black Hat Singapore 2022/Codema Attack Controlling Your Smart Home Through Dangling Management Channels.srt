2
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:10,320
hello everyone

3
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:12,880
uh we are very glad to be on the stage

4
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:15,519
of the heart asia again to share

5
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:17,520
something about smart home security

6
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:18,560
hosts

7
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:22,240
my name is janja a research associate at

8
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:26,000
langkai university china

9
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:29,599
uh hi guys i'm bing yuan from university

10
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:32,880
of science and technology channel today

11
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,239
uh yeah and i will both to present our

12
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:39,040
work on the smart home security

13
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:41,440
with you guys and i'm really glad to be

14
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:43,200
here thank you

15
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:44,480
yeah okay

16
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:47,920
uh i will first introduce the first part

17
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:49,600
of the talk and

18
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:53,280
then beam will continue the second part

19
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,879
this talk is based on a joint work from

20
00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:58,559
file universities

21
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:01,920
the academic paper on security risk of

22
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:04,400
disjointed iot device management

23
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:05,600
channels

24
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:08,799
was published at acm ccs

25
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:11,360
november 2021.

26
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:13,520
you can find more details by reaching

27
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:16,240
out our paper

28
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:17,360
first

29
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:20,720
let's take a look at how a user operates

30
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:23,360
smart home devices in general

31
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:26,320
after we set up a smart device for

32
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:29,280
example a smart lock on the door

33
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:32,400
we can remotely control the door to open

34
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,439
or close by the companion app it is very

35
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:37,280
convenient for us

36
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,000
to control our home appliances from the

37
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,640
phone and we can manage people who can

38
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:45,200
resize the device

39
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,720
however

40
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:49,759
with the number of iot devices increased

41
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:53,600
the number of iot apps may also increase

42
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,920
for example a house owner can use the

43
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:59,439
physical q app to turn on turn off her

44
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:00,640
light bulbs

45
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:03,920
the icemat gave up to open her garage

46
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,439
store

47
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:08,959
august app to lock her from store

48
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:12,080
but too many apps may annoy users

49
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,800
imagine that you need to switch from

50
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,800
apps to apps for controlling and

51
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:20,560
checking different appliances all day

52
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,440
thus

53
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:25,040
uh we would like a one ring to zoom out

54
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:27,280
actually the increasing diversity and

55
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,480
the flight training of iot devices give

56
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,879
rise to sub-party solutions

57
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:36,160
we can manage different devices

58
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,800
regardless of their manufacturers for

59
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:42,239
example apple's home kit zigbee and the

60
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:44,480
real compatible frameworks and smart

61
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:47,599
speakers users can use one app to load

62
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:50,000
them out

63
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,120
one most popular kind of solution is the

64
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,200
cloud-based smart speaker

65
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,280
the user command the different device

66
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,760
render clause delegate the right to

67
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:02,560
smart speaker cloud and the user

68
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,400
can control all devices through the

69
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:07,040
speakers cloud as shown in the picture

70
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,239
and right

71
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:10,560
the cross-render delegation together

72
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,239
with user sharing

73
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:14,800
generate a complicated delegation chain

74
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:17,120
which brings challenges for the access

75
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,519
control enforcement

76
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:21,760
these risks hidden in the complex

77
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:24,400
dedication chain were discussed in our

78
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:28,319
talk last year at the black hat asia

79
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:30,319
this time we focused on something

80
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:31,360
different

81
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:34,000
there are many third-party solutions and

82
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,400
the different users may have different

83
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,760
prevalence

84
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:41,440
a question for the vendors here is that

85
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:44,400
how to light both the group of people

86
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,680
favor and better products

87
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,680
for users most convenience and

88
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,120
capability

89
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,680
manufacturers tend to integrate multiple

90
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,760
frameworks in addition to its own

91
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:56,799
framework

92
00:03:56,799 --> 00:03:59,120
and the people who favor different apps

93
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,360
can use the device

94
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:04,000
here also in our research we call

95
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,480
such a framework including

96
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:09,920
os device and the cloud side components

97
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:13,280
a device management channel

98
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,200
our iot device

99
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:18,959
uh the user console the iot cloud hub

100
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:19,839
and

101
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:22,240
the on-device software stack

102
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,000
together from the device management

103
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,040
channel to allow the user to mount

104
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,960
the garage door opener has two

105
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:32,080
disjointed dmv the manufacturers and the

106
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,639
apple's home kit from the picture we can

107
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:36,800
see that they share the same hardware

108
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,680
boot up and the website provision but

109
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:43,360
there are no any control between them

110
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:47,120
the owner use the home kit only

111
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,360
and the attacker can hardly control the

112
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,440
device results the owner's permission

113
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:52,880
circumcase

114
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:55,199
because of apple home case

115
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:58,400
is user management

116
00:04:58,479 --> 00:04:59,520
however

117
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:02,560
the manufacturer's dmc is dangling and

118
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,960
in the waiting for binding state an

119
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:09,479
attacker can still see the bands

120
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:14,400
manufactures dmc under control the

121
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,600
device

122
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,400
similarly a physical hue devices support

123
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:21,120
multiple dmc the manufactures bluetooth

124
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:25,680
cmc and the zigbee dmc these two dmcs

125
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,759
are based on different communication

126
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:30,560
timings and work independently

127
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,600
so

128
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,240
if the owner occupies the manufacturer's

129
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,680
bluetooth one

130
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:39,440
an attacker can take the other

131
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:43,759
if the owner choose a zigbee channel

132
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:46,160
an attacker can take over the bluetooth

133
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,400
one

134
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:53,719
now i will show you the reading

135
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:01,360
the video i can control the file

136
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:03,680
and

137
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,919
those titles form is shown in the right

138
00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:08,240
corner

139
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,400
the attacker can use the bluetooth

140
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,600
channel

141
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:16,600
to control above results and information

142
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,039
okay

143
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:34,000
in the two cases mentioned

144
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,680
the dmc management is fully disjointed

145
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:38,400
and

146
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,759
the attacker

147
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:41,840
can easily control the devices through

148
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:44,319
the dongle dmc

149
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:45,440
further

150
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:48,560
we found even though some manufacturers

151
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:51,840
try to control other sub-party dmc

152
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:54,479
the device can still suffer illegal

153
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:56,800
sites but this figure

154
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,919
shows the august smallock try to control

155
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:03,199
the homecare by utilizing aed

156
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:07,199
ad is a addition

157
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:10,400
there uh iphone creator provides this

158
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,880
mechanism from line for vendors to set a

159
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,960
secret and home cater will check this

160
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:19,680
secret when receiving operation commands

161
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:22,319
if there is

162
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:25,440
no id an attacker may take the dangling

163
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,880
homekit channel

164
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:32,160
to read and write the status of the lock

165
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,000
however

166
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,599
because of the

167
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:39,280
id with the guard of ad the attacker

168
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,479
cannot

169
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:42,840
open the lock without the owner's

170
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:45,120
permission because

171
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,840
the locker will check the command

172
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,840
rather carry on a

173
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:52,560
correct ad

174
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,639
so the attacker can

175
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:58,160
only read the logs status

176
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,680
there are maybe

177
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:02,240
some privacy concerns because the letter

178
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,840
because the attacker can read the

179
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:06,560
unlocked status remotely by about

180
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:09,680
by bluetooth but the attacker cannot

181
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:13,599
break in the victim's house right

182
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:14,960
so the

183
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:17,440
so the key point here is

184
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,759
how to get an id

185
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:21,120
we know that

186
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:24,720
the august app will pass the aed to

187
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:28,400
homekit app but how can the attacker

188
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:32,639
get the aad of the target lock

189
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:36,799
here we consider a device sharing

190
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:38,159
scenario

191
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:41,120
in some scenario a user may temporarily

192
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,519
share the device with other untrusted

193
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:44,560
people

194
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:47,440
for example i i've been being guests

195
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,360
or a babysitter

196
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,600
in this device sharing scenario a

197
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,959
malicious user can abuse this temporary

198
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:56,000
permission

199
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,600
to quietly enable the iphone home hdmc

200
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:03,200
and bypass ad to his ios

201
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,040
august app

202
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,080
also

203
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,480
the owner revokes the

204
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:11,519
attacker's access regulator the attacker

205
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:12,800
can still

206
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,959
operate the lock through the home keep

207
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:19,120
channel yeah so the owner just revoke

208
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,160
the

209
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,959
attacker's permission on the august app

210
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:24,480
but he cannot

211
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,959
remove him from the home keep channel

212
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:28,160
which means

213
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:31,200
a malicious user could still open the

214
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,640
door after he checks out

215
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:38,640
if the owner is using an android phone

216
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:41,600
he even cannot see any panel of the home

217
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,760
kit in his android phone because the

218
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:46,640
homekit is developed by the

219
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,000
apple and

220
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,160
only supported in ios

221
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:52,240
ios smartphone

222
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:55,200
so this means the owner if the owner is

223
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:58,320
an android owner as an owner can hardly

224
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,720
find the home cater is took over by

225
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:04,120
another person

226
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:07,760
okay next bean will show something more

227
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:12,000
interesting funding in our study

228
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:16,079
okay thank you and hello again to all

229
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:19,120
and again being from uh university of

230
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:21,839
science and technology and now i will

231
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:25,360
take over to uh show more details of our

232
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,320
work

233
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:29,519
uh yeah so let's continue with the uh

234
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:31,440
understanding the problem which we

235
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:35,040
called the the kodama problem so recall

236
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:37,600
that uh ian just mentioned that there

237
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:41,040
are uh four states uh

238
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:44,079
in the in a single gmc's uh state

239
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:46,800
machine model which is the factory uh

240
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:49,920
stage link with the put up the device

241
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:52,560
where uh turning to the waiting college

242
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:56,240
work uh stage uh and after the lich book

243
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,800
provision the uh

244
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,240
the

245
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,959
the device while waiting for the user's

246
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:05,680
commands for binding and after the bind

247
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:08,320
the the back the binding operation in

248
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:11,040
the device will uh transfer into the

249
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,600
running stage well right

250
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:16,800
it takes the operations and executes the

251
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,240
commands

252
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:21,600
so uh ian just mentioned the three flaws

253
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,320
actually the lower and the flow two uh

254
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:27,279
happens at during the factory state that

255
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:30,800
is the uh exploited the dmc each at this

256
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:34,079
stage and the attacker manages to

257
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:36,320
gain unauthorized control from this

258
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,560
stage and for the

259
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:41,519
for the floor for this actually happens

260
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:42,560
during the

261
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:46,480
run time which uh which needs to be um

262
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:49,760
authorized access to the smart home uh

263
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:52,079
to the to the home kit enabled august

264
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:53,519
the smart lock

265
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:56,399
so literally uh one might think what

266
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:59,680
about the two other states uh are these

267
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:02,320
are these students are these uh

268
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,880
are these two states also vulnerable and

269
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,639
how we can exploit

270
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:09,519
explore such vulnerabilities for attacks

271
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:12,480
um so we take uh uh

272
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:15,120
so so we take a deep look into this and

273
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,600
unfortunately we we found about

274
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:20,639
uh these uh there are other flaws that

275
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:24,959
are also possible to uh for the attacker

276
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:27,600
to to gain unauthorized

277
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,639
access to the device so let's uh take uh

278
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:33,680
let's first uh take a look at the abort

279
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:34,880
system

280
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:37,680
uh the the old the abort system is

281
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:40,160
actually a security alarm system for the

282
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:43,760
smart home and it supports both the

283
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:48,079
manufacturer dmc and the home cage dmc

284
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:51,120
actually a board tries to secure their

285
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:54,160
system by hiding the setup code of the

286
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:56,880
home page dmc that means

287
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:59,760
to set up the to enable the home page of

288
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,360
dmc

289
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:04,240
users actually have to give access

290
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,800
in permission from the manufacturer dmc

291
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:09,600
first and then uh from the manufacturer

292
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:10,880
dmc

293
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:14,399
he can obtain a setup code and then use

294
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:16,560
this developer code to enable the home

295
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,800
kit dmc

296
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:21,519
this enhanced the security uh since uh

297
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:24,399
uh since uh would work fine in a blind

298
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:27,839
scenario but again if we uh consider the

299
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:31,519
the scenario where a temporary uh uh

300
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:35,440
guest is uh uh is is within your home as

301
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,200
as liam just mentioned

302
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:41,360
uh so a malicious uh guest um

303
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:42,720
can uh

304
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:45,279
can usually can uh can

305
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:48,560
can explore this vulnerability uh

306
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,240
to attack the

307
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:54,320
the abode system uh to uh to this week

308
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:58,240
specifically uh if if the malicious user

309
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:01,680
is temporarily authorized to to

310
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:04,560
access the manufacture dmc so he he

311
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,000
could

312
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,800
he could steal the setup coach

313
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:11,040
when he is authorized and they use this

314
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:14,000
setup code to enable the homepage dmc

315
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,399
without the permission from the owner

316
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:20,880
and he can maintain such uh uh such uh

317
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:24,000
control even after his his permission is

318
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,720
revoked from the uh manufacturers team

319
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:30,000
say so that's the uh that's the flow

320
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,880
that we found uh happens during the uh

321
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:36,079
which uh which for binding stage

322
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:39,440
and also we found the uh the with the

323
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:42,240
wish for uh rich worker probation state

324
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:45,120
is also vulnerable specifically the

325
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,399
thing the

326
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:49,199
philips hue manufacturer channel tries

327
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:52,000
to control the natural perversion of the

328
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,120
of the the smart speakers cmc

329
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:58,079
in specific if the device is paired with

330
00:14:58,079 --> 00:14:58,880
the

331
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:01,760
uh the manufacturer's dmc which is the

332
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:04,320
lower one uh the the hue the the

333
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:07,600
physical steam say first the uh

334
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:10,240
uh the the iot the attacker will not be

335
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:13,920
able to use the the smart speak dmc to

336
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:17,279
control the uh the the device this is

337
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:18,320
because

338
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:22,399
um after the of the device is paired

339
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:25,279
with the from the from the manufacture

340
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:29,120
gmc uh the owner has to click a button

341
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:31,760
in the inner eye which is the make

342
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:33,040
discoverable

343
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:34,399
button to

344
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:36,800
uh to enable the

345
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:40,959
the device to accept a new pair request

346
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:42,160
from other

347
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:44,959
dimensions such as the

348
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:48,000
such as the vr the bre

349
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,880
dmc from the from a smart speaker

350
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,000
however

351
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,399
such protection does not work if the

352
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:57,279
owner opts to use the smartphone the

353
00:15:57,279 --> 00:16:00,480
smart speaker dmc first

354
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:01,839
and uh

355
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:03,440
which leaves the

356
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,920
the manufacturer didn't say unused

357
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:08,399
thing again the the tiger can use this

358
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:11,279
uh dangling a manufacturer game say to

359
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:14,800
game to game um um authorized

360
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,959
control to the device

361
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:20,079
uh so that's all the flaws we we have

362
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:23,279
found and if we take a close look at the

363
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:26,880
attacks actually uh each attack relies

364
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:30,160
on some conditions which we summarize as

365
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:33,680
the following three conditions uh first

366
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:36,720
the first insight the device owner hopes

367
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:40,079
to uh ops for some but not all gmc to

368
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:43,360
manage a device uh for example the the

369
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,839
flow four requests this condition to be

370
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:48,639
true for that for the attacker to

371
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:51,519
successfully gain authorized access

372
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:54,160
control also the second condition is

373
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:56,720
that the adversary can access the

374
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:59,759
targeted device wi-fi network uh

375
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:03,759
this this condition is required for um

376
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:06,400
follow one floor three and four four

377
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:09,119
because they needed to get into the uh

378
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:12,000
into the whole network of the victim to

379
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:12,959
uh

380
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:15,919
to connect to the devices and the the

381
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:18,640
last condition is that the

382
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:21,119
owner grants the adversary a temporal

383
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:23,359
access to the targeted device

384
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:25,839
which is required in the

385
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:29,039
floor 3 and floor 4 we just mentioned

386
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:30,640
so

387
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:33,440
so that is the the the problem the

388
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:35,760
codoma the code memorabilities are

389
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:38,240
actually highly related to the to the

390
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:41,200
human behaviors such as which dms does

391
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,520
the owner uses and does the owner

392
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:46,640
willing to uh share their their wife

393
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:49,520
elite work to up to other users so we

394
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:51,919
did a user study to understand the

395
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:55,280
visibility of the the attacks we found

396
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:58,240
uh specifically we set up a user study

397
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:00,400
uh and ask the

398
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:03,120
participants to set up a device that

399
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:06,400
supports that support multiple dmcs and

400
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,720
after that we asked them to

401
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:11,039
feel a follow-up question mayor

402
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:13,919
and about how how they would prefer to

403
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:17,360
use their smart home devices

404
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:20,720
so um the reason the result actually

405
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:23,679
shows that all the conditions we uh we

406
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:26,400
just mentioned can be made in the real

407
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,799
world as much as in the real-world

408
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:32,400
smartphone scenarios uh actually uh over

409
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:36,799
83 percent partic uh over 83 percent

410
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:40,160
participants only set up one gmc which

411
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,559
means uh there are

412
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:45,600
unused dms

413
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,600
in the device which leaves

414
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:50,640
a door for the attackers to to

415
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:53,919
leverage such dangling dmcs for attack

416
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:56,880
and also for the condition 2 the home

417
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:59,200
wifi network is usually shared but the

418
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,520
password is really changed which also

419
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:04,160
makes it possible to uh

420
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:06,000
for the condition too

421
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,559
to be uh to be true in the in the real

422
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:11,600
world and as an austria the iot users

423
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,840
are actually waiting uh are actually

424
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:16,080
waiting to share smartphone devices such

425
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:20,480
as um airbnb case uh an imb host will

426
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:23,760
share the uh their devices to the airbnb

427
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:26,400
gist so which indicates that the

428
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,799
condition three can also be true in the

429
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:31,679
in the railroad scenario

430
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:35,039
so with these conditions uh all can be

431
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:38,480
made which which makes the our uh the

432
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:41,679
the flows we identified can be uh can be

433
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:44,320
well can be realistic in the real world

434
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:47,520
then we uh we take it from from the

435
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,760
windows perspective because we want to

436
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:53,120
know uh whether the the window or the

437
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:55,440
manufacturer have provided enough

438
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:58,160
information to inform their users to

439
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:00,080
avoid such problems

440
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:03,440
again unfortunately we found that almost

441
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:06,240
almost all that when the windows failed

442
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:09,600
to inform the users of this of these

443
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:12,400
new risks i think this is uh this is

444
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,880
probably the the windows

445
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,360
by now they actually

446
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:22,080
didn't realize such risks also so

447
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:24,320
they cannot provide the

448
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:26,480
the guidance the security guidance to

449
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:29,679
them to their users to secure to secure

450
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:32,880
uh their their devices

451
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:35,919
so with the attacks and with the

452
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:37,600
uh with the

453
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:38,480
uh

454
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,880
cons with the serious consequences we

455
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:44,159
want to fix this the uh this problem so

456
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:46,159
an idea um

457
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:49,360
um an ideal solution would be a user can

458
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:52,320
use any dmc to control all the other

459
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:55,600
dimensions however uh search to achieve

460
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:58,640
to achieve that request all the all the

461
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:00,960
parties such as the windows the

462
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:03,200
manufacturers the iot

463
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:05,360
service providers all of them to work

464
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:06,799
together to

465
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:08,159
produce a

466
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:10,640
standardized

467
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:13,039
standardized cross-channel management

468
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:15,760
protocol however we think given the

469
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:18,559
current stage of the iot ecosystem it

470
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:21,360
would take a very long time however the

471
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:25,440
the users who are exposed to the kodama

472
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:29,200
risks they cannot wait so

473
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:31,200
before an idea and the long-term

474
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:34,000
solution can be uh fully developed and

475
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,480
deployed we propose the

476
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:39,679
sea god which is short for china god

477
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:42,880
and the sea god is a practical and

478
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:45,919
lightweight and the effective mitigation

479
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:49,200
it can be easily adopted by the diverse

480
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:52,400
manufacturers to mitigate the the the

481
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:55,120
caudal attacks we just proposed and it

482
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:58,240
actually requires no change to the third

483
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:00,159
party dmcs

484
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:01,440
specifically

485
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:03,840
we implemented a safeguard in the

486
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:06,960
application launch layer uh on the on

487
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:10,000
the device and it would use the level

488
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,960
the dmc libraries which are already in

489
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:15,280
the device uh and

490
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:18,320
to to enable or disable uh

491
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:21,600
the the dmcs as the owners wish

492
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:23,919
so specifically when designing the

493
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:26,400
safeguard we have two goals first is the

494
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:29,120
control group which means the users can

495
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:31,520
fully control her device

496
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:34,799
including enable or disable all of the

497
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:38,000
dmcs and then for the usability we want

498
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:38,960
to

499
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:41,440
make sure the users can choose any dmc

500
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:44,640
first to use when when the

501
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,159
when he got the

502
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:48,480
when he bought a new device which means

503
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:50,960
the user can choose any device

504
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:54,559
any dmc to use at the factory stage um

505
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:56,559
so um

506
00:22:56,559 --> 00:22:59,840
specifically the dmcs are actually

507
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:02,240
opened at factory stage under the sea

508
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:05,440
guard and then if the if the owner

509
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:08,080
chooses to use the manufactured dmc

510
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:08,960
first

511
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:11,600
she can sync the commands from her eye

512
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:15,280
to uh to disable the other third-party

513
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:17,120
uh dmcs which

514
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:19,520
which means it would block the

515
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:22,480
attacks from leveraging such dangoni

516
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:24,960
dimensions for attack

517
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:27,760
and of course the the owner can always

518
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:31,120
issue an enable command to

519
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:35,440
reopen to re-enable a third-party dmc

520
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:36,880
and therefore

521
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:39,520
so that an authorized user can can use

522
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,760
this dmc to control the

523
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:44,799
the the device which which maintains the

524
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:47,039
the devastatory functionality of the

525
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:49,679
smart of the smart home devices

526
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:53,440
and also if the um if the if the owner

527
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:56,480
chooses to use the a third-party dmc

528
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:59,760
first for example the the user might

529
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:01,919
choose to use the iphone home cage

530
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:05,039
manufacturer the iphone kids dmc first

531
00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:08,000
to control the device then the the sea

532
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,120
guard will automatically uh disables all

533
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:12,799
the other um

534
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:15,039
all the other dmcs including the

535
00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:18,640
manufacturer dmc so that the uh the

536
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:21,600
attacks cannot leverage uh the the

537
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:25,039
dangling game says to uh to attack the

538
00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:26,559
device

539
00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:28,080
so uh

540
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:31,600
uh so that's the the flaws we found and

541
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,039
the the

542
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:35,520
the the the timing protection we

543
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:36,720
proposed

544
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:39,520
and in summary we we actually discovered

545
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:42,559
a new type of vulnerability in the in

546
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:45,919
the iot ecosystem and it involves many

547
00:24:45,919 --> 00:24:48,320
uh vendors including apple homecage

548
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:52,240
august phillips who uh etc and

549
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:55,679
uh we demonstrated that the attack is uh

550
00:24:55,679 --> 00:24:59,039
realistic with poc attacks and with the

551
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:01,760
uh the the user studies and the way and

552
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:04,559
the consequence can actually be serious

553
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:07,039
because the uh for example the orchestra

554
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:10,000
not uh the one of the vulnerable uh

555
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,559
devices the orchestra lock which means

556
00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:15,200
attacker can can use this to unlock the

557
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:17,919
victim's goal and

558
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:21,840
to uh to mitigate such problem we we

559
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:23,919
propose a uh

560
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:26,400
a a timely and

561
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:29,120
uh naturated solution

562
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:32,320
which is the sea guard and it can be uh

563
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:34,960
deployed by the manufacturers alone and

564
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:38,159
without requiring to change the dams uh

565
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:41,520
without uh changing the third party dms

566
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:44,880
so it can be provide a timely protection

567
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:46,320
to the users

568
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:47,200
so

569
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:49,360
that we all thank you very much and we

570
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:52,640
are happy to take questions thank you

571
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:55,640
thanks
