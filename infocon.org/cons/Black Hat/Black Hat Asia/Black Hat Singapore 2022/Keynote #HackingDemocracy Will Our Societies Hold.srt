so welcome to black hat asia singapore

9
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:27,119
this is the country where we tried our

10
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:28,880
very first black hat outside of the

11
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:31,920
united states almost 25 years ago

12
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:33,600
24 years ago

13
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,760
so it's always fantastic to be back

14
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:38,399
where you started

15
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:40,719
as i mentioned this is the 25th year of

16
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:42,239
black hat so we have a lot of special

17
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:43,840
things planned

18
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:45,520
and before we get going with our keynote

19
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,760
today i want to tell you

20
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,600

and

22
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:52,640
and remind some people of

23
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:56,480
projects that we do at black hat like

24
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:58,160
trying to renew and trying to bring in

25
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:59,680
the younger generation trying to bring

26
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:02,000
people into black hat into our community

27
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,920
that aren't maybe well established in

28
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:05,280
business or

29
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:08,000
don't have the financial resources uh to

30
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,280
attend

31
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,960
to try to compensate for that we have a

32
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:12,479
scholarship program

33
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:14,640
where people can submit white papers and

34
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,400
do some unique research and send it in

35
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,320
to us and if it

36
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:19,920

00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:45,840
and get to know them because these will

48
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,200
be the next generation of a lot of

49
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:50,880
people uh entering our industry

50
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,079
also

51
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:52,880
um

52
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,799
even though this conference came

53
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:56,960
together very rapidly in person it was

54
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,479
originally planned

55
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:00,799
to be a purely virtual event now we're

56
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:04,399
hybrid and we have attendees from 158

57
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:06,159
countries

58
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:07,600
around the world

59
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:10,239
some are virtual a lot of physical right

60
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:13,040
so it's truly a global interest what's

61
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,879
happening in information security is

62
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:16,720
completely global in the early days we

63
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:19,280
might have 20 countries 30 countries and

64
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,280
every year it's increased and increased

65
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,200
and now it's at such a level that it's

66
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,640
just safe to say that basically the

67
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,840
whole planet

68
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:28,400
is always in attendance at a black hat

69
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,239
and that's because people are desperate

70
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:33,599
to try to understand what is going on

71
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:34,480
and

72
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:35,840
in this environment right now the

73
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:38,720
geopolitical environment

74
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,800
a lot of people

75
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,080
are desperate to figure out what's going

76
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,280
on

77
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,000
so

78
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,879
the program is today we have a keynote

79
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:48,160
that's a virtual

80
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:50,400
tomorrow we have a keynote that's

81
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,519
in person um we have the lock note and

82
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:56,160
tomorrow's uh session with chris inglis

83
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,720
is also live here

84
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:01,280
and so i'll say a couple of remarks now

85
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,280
and then we'll get into

86
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:06,319
the keynote with samir sarong

87
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:08,239
so if you've attended black hat

88
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:09,680
singapore in the past or if you watch

89
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:13,280
the videos that we make available online

90
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,120
you'll notice that i've commented before

91
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:18,239
about how i think there's three groups

92
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:20,080
three teams that are forming on the

93
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,159
internet this has been forming for a

94
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:24,319
number of years right there's team rule

95
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:25,760
of law

96
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,599
as this is there's not official terms

97
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:29,760
i'm just making this up team rule of law

98
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,280
and these are sort of like-minded

99
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:34,159
countries mostly democracies that view

100
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:36,640
the world sort of the same way

101
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:37,760
they might have different laws they

102
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,519
might have different ways of approaching

103
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:42,560
parliament or direct democracy but they

104
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,560
generally are team rule of law you've

105
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:47,360
got team authoritarian

106
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,680
which has been gaining some steam team

107
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:52,239
rule of law has

108
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:54,400
very messy public discourse team

109
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,640
authoritarian has very clean internal

110
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,080
discourse because it's usually heavily

111
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,840
censored so the problems that team

112
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,840
authoritarian cares about is control of

113
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,200
information

114
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,040
and when you talk to team authoritarian

115
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,480
and they're talking about information

116
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:09,599
warfare they're talking about

117
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:11,280
cyber security a lot of what they're

118
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,040
talking about is control of internal

119
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:16,079
communications control of internal

120
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:17,600
conversation

121
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,880
and then in the middle you've got team

122
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,238
undecided

123
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:21,918
and team undecided

124
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:23,840
might very logically not want to have to

125
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,840
pick a side

126
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,759
but team rule of law

127
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:29,600
team authoritarians trying to pull and

128
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,440
push them to make a decision trying to

129
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,720
get them to commit

130
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,560
what side are you on you know are you

131
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,240
with us are you not are you in between

132
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,680
what's going on

133
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,759
and this is accelerated with a russian

134
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:41,520
invasion in ukraine

135
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,720
and it's accelerated for a number of

136
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,400
reasons one

137
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,919
governments just want to know are you

138
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:47,360
going to try to avoid

139
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,120
and evade their sanctions or are you

140
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:51,520
going to help them with their sanctions

141
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:52,320
are you

142
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,759
how much time do we have to think about

143
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:55,280
what you're doing but the other

144
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:57,120
interesting thing that's happening now

145
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,120
is in the past my thinking was mostly

146
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,960
around governments

147
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,479
now i'm adapting it now i'm thinking

148
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:03,840
about companies

149
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,520
now i'm thinking about

150
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,440
uh what do they call super empowered

151
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,520
individuals i'll give you some examples

152
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:10,880
so

153
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:13,120
mongodb

154
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,320
does anybody in the audience use the

155
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:17,840
mongodb open source database framework

156
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:21,440
okay so if you're using mongodb

157
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:24,080
they as an open source project as a

158
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:27,919
civil society private entity decided

159
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:29,120
that they weren't going to have russian

160
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,360
users anymore

161
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,360
and they deleted

162
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,199
the database of all the users and

163
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:38,320
projects in russia

164
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,160
all the people in russia that was using

165
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:42,000
mongodb woke up the next day and it was

166
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,320
gone

167
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,639
that wasn't directed by a government

168
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:48,400
that was their community deciding that

169
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,080
they were going to essentially delete

170
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,280
russia

171
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,039
now is that right

172
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:54,320
is that heavy-handed is that an

173
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,919
overreaction

174
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:57,440
probably

175
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:00,639
but we're now in an age of hyper

176
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:02,720
connected

177
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,080
and empowered

178
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,759
individuals and open source projects

179
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:07,120
that aren't answering to governments

180
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,080
maybe they're answering to their

181
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,759
community and their community says we're

182
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:11,759
not okay with these human rights abuses

183
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:15,039
we have to do something

184
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,280
do you think your company or you might

185
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,520
be put in a situation where you have to

186
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:22,400
make some choices

187
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,000
that's the world we're now starting to

188
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,199
live in

189
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:27,280
your government might be in one

190
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,880
team

191
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,639
but you as an individual or as a company

192
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:33,039
might be on another team

193
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:35,440
this makes me really uncomfortable in

194
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:38,240
the sense that i hate being sordid

195
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,720
governments hate when they're the ones

196
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:44,160
being not doing the sorting

197
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:45,600
and you can see this in the united

198
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:46,960
states trying to get ahead of it a

199
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,479
little bit there was a declaration for

200
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:50,400
the independence of the internet

201
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,520
a statement

202
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:54,720
a document that was put out last month

203
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:57,759
by the united states but it was created

204
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:01,360
in conjunction with 60 other countries

205
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,919
so here's sort of an early expression of

206
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:06,160
team rule of law getting 60 countries

207
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,479
together saying here are the things we

208
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:10,160
believe in

209
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:13,120
and they're doing that partially to sort

210
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,960
they're trying to sort

211
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:19,039
who else wants to join these principles

212
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:20,800
because the more you can create your

213
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,120
team the more you can sort the more

214
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,639
efficient it becomes the better it is to

215
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:26,000
decide where we're going to put our

216
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,440
energy right

217
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:28,400
and

218
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,919
holding a conference in singapore is

219
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:32,000
fascinating because singapore

220
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,880
in my view um needs to really stay in

221
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:37,280
team undecided

222
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,520
it's it's not a big enough country it

223
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:42,720
just it can't easily pick sides

224
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,319
especially if you're squeezed between

225
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:46,960
say the united states and china

226
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:49,280
that's a that's a that's a pretty tough

227
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:51,759
spot to be in but when you are in team

228
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:53,599
undecided you can be a little bit more

229
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:55,680
nimble right you can translate between

230
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,360
the different groups

231
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:00,160
you can maybe sort of

232
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,960
see things and identify things that that

233
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,639
other sides don't

234
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:06,400
so i just want you to think about how

235
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,919
what you're seeing going on in the

236
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:11,120
internet is part of it is the teams

237
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:13,599
solidifying and sorting

238
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:14,960
companies and individuals and

239
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,720
governments into these buckets and where

240
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,639
will you be

241
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:20,400
another sorting that happened was the

242
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:23,039
legal sanctions side so you can see this

243
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:23,919
in

244
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:25,759
different countries you united nations i

245
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:29,360
mean uh european union passing sanctions

246
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,879
on

247
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:32,880
russian companies

248
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,479
and then the civil companies are trying

249
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:36,399
to decide well what does that mean to us

250
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:38,839
and nominet a red internet registry

251
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:41,279
registrar their lawyers got together

252
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:42,399
they talked to the board and they

253
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:43,440
decided

254
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,279
that it's too risky

255
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:48,480
so they stopped registering

256
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:51,680
domain names in russia

257
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:53,440
and then how do you renew if you can't

258
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,200
process a credit card all those domain

259
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,399
names of all those companies could

260
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:58,000
expire and if they expire well then

261
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,279
maybe fishers or spammers can domain

262
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:03,040
squat on those and then re-register

263
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:05,600
email accounts and impersonate it i mean

264
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,440
you can see how it's hyper

265
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,760
complicated

266
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,360
but the intention starts with a good

267
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:15,279
intention and it snowballs

268
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,000
on the civil society front there's a

269
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,040
group called sanctions.net

270
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,880
and the idea is

271
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:25,760
if i have on my mailing server a black

272
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,120
hole list

273
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:30,320
or you know an rbl or i use some like

274
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:33,040
known bad ip databases to try to block

275
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,160
spam

276
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:36,000
or maybe if it's for my ips i'm trying

277
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,959
to block connections from bot cncs that

278
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:42,000
are known bad addresses

279
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,240
should i also have a black hole list for

280
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:47,920
sanctioned ip addresses

281
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,519
i don't want to do business i don't want

282
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:50,880
connections coming from sanctioned

283
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,240
russian

284
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,399
governments or military or

285
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:55,839
companies i don't want to be in

286
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:57,360
violation so

287
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,200
the civil society haven't moved here to

288
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,880
create a list for the people who want to

289
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,399
be able to say to their customers we

290
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:04,880
don't communicate with i don't know war

291
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,959
criminals

292
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:08,959
it's never been done before make civil

293
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:12,720
society really uncomfortable

294
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,880
but people want to be able to say we're

295
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,640
not communicating with these sanctioned

296
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:17,680
companies

297
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:19,440
so sanctions.net is an attempt to

298
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,519
address this where they're trying to

299
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:23,760
enumerate every government agency every

300
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:26,240
net block

301
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:28,079
and allow you to block it at your bgp

302
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:30,480
routing or maybe your ip filter

303
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,560
these initiatives are not going away

304
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:33,839
what's happening with the russian

305
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:36,079
invasions is accelerating all of this

306
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:38,320
sorting

307
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,760
and i want to uh

308
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:41,120
draw your attention to something i said

309
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:43,040
last year

310
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:45,600
at singapore and it was i like to repeat

311
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:48,079
that that internet problems are global

312
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:49,519
problems

313
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:51,680
and being a global problem

314
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,519
even if we sort into these different

315
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:54,880
three buckets

316
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,560
we are still all going to have to

317
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,880
communicate and work together it doesn't

318
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,399
mean that the buckets don't talk to each

319
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:01,200
other

320
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,880
it just means there's essentially three

321
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,720
perspectives

322
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,079
and the three perspectives are going to

323
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:07,440
have to learn how to work with each

324
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:10,240
other to solve global internet scale

325
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,440
problems

326
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,440
and generally a lot of that is happening

327
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,519
through civil society groups standards

328
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:17,680
bodies the ietf

329
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,200
i can

330
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:22,000
on the governmental level itu maybe the

331
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,240
oewg

332
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:27,040
the gge

333
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,959
and so

334
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:30,480
i want you to also think about the

335
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:33,040
strength as individuals and as a company

336
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,640
most of the infrastructure is privately

337
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,959
owned you have the right to not talk to

338
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:39,360
any network you don't want to talk to

339
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,040
like that puts you in a very strong

340
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,560
position

341
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:45,360
but you also have to understand that

342
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:48,399
civil society us as individuals we're

343
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:52,320
going to be the ones that really enable

344
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:55,760
how these three groups will interact if

345
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:58,160
the super powered individual individuals

346
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,959
go too far they'll be regulated

347
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:02,399
right if the two sides are too

348
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:04,240
aggressive squeezing team undecided in

349
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,600
the middle that's going to create a lot

350
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,560
of bad blood and animosity

351
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:10,079
if you're trying to sell products into

352
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:11,920
russia right now

353
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:13,440
don't be surprised if team rule of law

354
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:16,160
comes after you

355
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:18,079
technologists hate hearing about this

356
00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:21,680
stuff this layer eight and nine politics

357
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:22,959
and budget

358
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:24,720
but this is the world we're in and it's

359
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,320
and it's we've gotten here much faster

360
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,399
than i thought so i just want to point

361
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:31,440
out that um there's a saying that goes

362
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,680
um code is law

363
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:36,160
and i forget uh i think it was larry

364
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:38,560
oh gosh stanford university law

365
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:40,000
professor said this and i think even

366
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,079
wrote a book code is law

367
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:43,760
and i was thinking about that well in

368
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,360
this future

369
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,959
with sanctions

370
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:48,880
and if code is law who's writing the

371
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:50,399
code so like it's sort of like who's

372
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:51,760
writing the law well who's writing the

373
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,200
code

374
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,639
and it's us

375
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:56,560
it's private companies are writing the

376
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:57,600
code

377
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,200
super empowered contributors to the

378
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,519
linux

379
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,519
operating system project are writing the

380
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:04,959
law right they're writing the code

381
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:06,399
they're writing the law governments are

382
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:08,880
not doing giant commits to get

383
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,880
right it's individuals and companies so

384
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:13,200
we're essentially writing the law

385
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,120
that civil society

386
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,639
and so

387
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:18,800
while you're hearing about airplanes and

388
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:21,120
governments just think your role you're

389
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,880
not off the hook

390
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:25,279
you have a role to play

391
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:26,720
and you can see this in

392
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:30,160
if you're following online bellingcat

393
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:31,519
bellingcat is an open source

394
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:34,160
intelligence civil society project that

395
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:36,320
is documenting russian war crimes but

396
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,920
before that they were documenting

397
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:40,000
through open source

398
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,519
the poisoning of a lot of russian

399
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:42,959
dissidents

400
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:45,040
like they're like a private intelligence

401
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,399
agency

402
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:49,199
in the service of civil society in

403
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:51,920
service of the planet trying to reveal

404
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:55,120
what's really going on

405
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:56,720
so

406
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:59,680
this wasn't a thing five ten years ago

407
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:01,519
we're seeing these super empowered

408
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:04,079
groups access to great satellite imagery

409
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:06,560
not a thing so much 10 years ago

410
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,240
and they're shedding light

411
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:11,360
in parts of governments and

412
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,600
company behavior for example the nso

413
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,600
group has gotten more attention

414
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,360
from the monk school

415
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:20,320
ron diebert school of citizen lab

416
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:22,399
revealing all the evil stuff that the

417
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:24,480
nso group of spyware and pegasus has

418
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,480
been doing to dissidents leaders

419
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,959
activists

420
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:30,639
that's not governments doing that that's

421
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:33,360
not interpol doing that

422
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,600
right that is a professor at a school in

423
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,279
toronto doing that

424
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:38,800
and he's changing the way that

425
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,320
governments and the united nations and

426
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,959
the european union regulate

427
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:44,720
so it's sort of a message i'm trying to

428
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:45,920
bring to you is that it can be very

429
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,120
empowering even if you don't think

430
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,480
you're having a lot of impact in your

431
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,160
day-to-day life you could go join and

432
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:51,760
help spelling cat

433
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:54,079
you could help make real change

434
00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:54,880
and

435
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:57,279
my overall message then is that civil

436
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:58,959
society is

437
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:01,680
critical critical in this future they

438
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,199
like to say that it icann the

439
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:05,120
multi-stakeholder model but if you

440
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,560
really look at icann it's somewhat

441
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:10,160
beholden to the isp constituency

442
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,320
but if you take all of these efforts

443
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:14,720
together the ietf and others

444
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,720
it's really a broad

445
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:19,839
group of citizens of every country

446
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:21,279
and so that's why i'm really kind of

447
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:23,600
excited to introduce samir saron our

448
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,680
keynote today

449
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,360
his keynote is going to be on hacking

450
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,560
democracy

451
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:31,279
will our society holds and i was lucky

452
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:34,800
enough to meet sir sameer as a

453
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,240
member on the global commission for the

454
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,920
stability of cyberspace where we served

455
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:39,600
together for three years

456
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:42,240
and he runs one of the most influential

457
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:44,000
or if not the most influential think

458
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,440
tank civil society think tank in india

459
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:49,360
and so his perspectives coming from the

460
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:51,279
largest most populous democracy in the

461
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:52,880
world

462
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,480
being squeezed between

463
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:55,519
russia

464
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:58,959
and the united states and china

465
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:02,800
he has some really interesting insights

466
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:03,519
so

467
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:05,199
he is the president of the observer

468
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:07,440
research foundation or orf india's

469
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:10,320
premier think tank he's in new delhi and

470
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,639
his research focuses on issues of global

471
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:13,759
governance

472
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:16,320
climate change energy policy technology

473
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:19,759
media and india's foreign policy

474
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:21,519
so with that i'm going to kick it off

475
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:23,600
with samir's keynote and then afterward

00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:57,440
our thoughts

colleagues of mine and i have been

493
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:02,079
engaged with in the past year and hope

494
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:06,160
to continue to pursue in the days ahead

495
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:08,480
the theme for today hacking democracy in

496
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,480
context of our

497
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:13,760
digital societies our technology-led

498
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:16,799
growth frameworks and indeed

499
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:17,760
our

500
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:21,439
highly uh digitized worlds uh is

501
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:23,039
important

502
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:27,199
what is at stake is the future of our

503
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:28,960
collaborations the future of our

504
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:31,039
co-existence and indeed the shape

505
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:34,000
functions and forms of our

506
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,440
social

507
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:36,799
settlements

508
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:39,760
arrangements constitutions and indeed

509
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:42,160
nations

510
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:44,080
one way of

511
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:46,480
approaching this question

512
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,559
would be to

513
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:51,360
present a counterfactual

514
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:53,039
rather than see

515
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:55,520
technology as this great

516
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:57,840
liberator of human expression

517
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,160
and catalyst for pluralism and

518
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:02,240
democratic thought

519
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:05,360
let us pose this as the new adversary a

520
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:08,000
new adversary to democracies a new

521
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,320
adversary to pluralism a new adversary

522
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,720
to freedom of expression and thought

523
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:14,559
and if we were to put this counter

524
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:18,400
factual as a point of investigation

525
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:21,919
perhaps we could start to examine it

526
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:23,760
and its inadequacies

527
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,520
in serving

528
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,360
what it seeks to do

529
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:28,400
to free up

530
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:31,039
to liberate and to strengthen human

531
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:33,840
expression innovation creativity and

532
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,200
commerce

533
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:38,799
has it been doing this or other outcomes

534
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:39,600
now

535
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,600
far more patchy and

536
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:42,640
require

537
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:44,960
us to investigate and explore

538
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:47,039
and perhaps course correct

539
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:49,200
our journey with

540
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,520
technologies with

541
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:54,840
tech companies and with

542
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:57,360
technicians technology was meant to

543
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:59,280
reduce

544
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:00,880
the gap between the palace and the

545
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:01,919
street

546
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:03,280
it was meant to be

547
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:06,640
a medium that allowed voices of millions

548
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,799
to reach those who

549
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:11,840
sought to govern them serve them

550
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:13,360
regulate them

551
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,840
and indeed protect them

552
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:17,280
and indeed

553
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:19,200
one could argue

554
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,679
that voices of millions today are more

555
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:23,280
accessible

556
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:24,480
due to

557
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,640
the ability of platforms and

558
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:27,919
communication

559
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:29,039
means

560
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:30,080
due to

561
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:33,440
the proliferation of smartphones and

562
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:35,360
and personal devices

563
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:36,320
due to

564
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:38,470
uh the plural

565
00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:39,760
[Music]

566
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:40,960
linguistic

567
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:43,120
frameworks that allow people from

568
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:44,240
different parts of the world to

569
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:45,760
participate in similar debates and

570
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,679
conversations

571
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:49,200
and indeed

572
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,960
that has been

573
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:54,000
clearly a net positive that has emerged

574
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:54,960
out of

575
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:59,440
our rapidly digitalizing societies

576
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:02,400
however it would be fair to say

577
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,520
that

578
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:04,880
while it was seen

579
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,400
as a force for good which would bridge

580
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,320
the gap between the state and the rest

581
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:10,480
of the streets

582
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:12,480
by design

583
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:15,200
these platforms that allow for this are

584
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:18,400
controlled by large enterprises and or

585
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:21,200
large governments the

586
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:23,120
the very

587
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:26,240
nature of democracy sometimes

588
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:29,360
makes this facet of our platforms uh

589
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:32,400
dangerous and detracts from the public

590
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,159
utility functions that they are meant to

591
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:36,240
serve

592
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:38,400
private companies all large governments

593
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,799
today are therefore in control of the

594
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:42,559
public sphere they can create

595
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:46,320
conversations they can censor expression

596
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:49,600
and they can ensure certain ideas

597
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:52,320
certain ideologies and certain

598
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:53,600
businesses

599
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:56,960
have a privilege over others

600
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:59,039
much of the world is now beginning to

601
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:00,080
wake up

602
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:01,200
to

603
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,440
this aspect of technology

604
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:06,080
the unaccountable power that boardrooms

605
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:08,400
today have over the human condition

606
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,960
the american west coast that is

607
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:14,240
hardwiring global conversations and of

608
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:17,039
course the rise of china tech

609
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:19,200
and their determination to dominate

610
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,799
innovation high technology and the

611
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:23,520
global perception ecosystem

612
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:25,520
they are all having this debate today

613
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:27,919
because we all know

614
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:29,600
that to some degree

615
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:32,080
this reality confronts all of us

616
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:34,400
and to some degree all of us must he

617
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,799
respond to it

618
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:39,440
for countries such as india

619
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:42,400
we are being caught between

620
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:43,840
a competition

621
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:46,159
on the one hand you have

622
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:47,840
the big companies from the west coast of

623
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:49,200
the united states

624
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,760
that serve their bottom lines that serve

625
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:53,679
their business models

626
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:55,200
and that operate under the american

627
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:57,200
constitutional arrangements

628
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,960
sometimes these companies together are

629
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,720
known as big tech

630
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:04,000
and we of course are also being lured to

631
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,320
invest into the chinese digital

632
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:09,760
offerings uh the the low-cost chinese

633
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:11,039
devices

634
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:13,760
the chinese social media platforms

635
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:17,440
the chinese video apps and others that

636
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:19,360
are beginning to make themselves

637
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:21,600
attractive all over the world

638
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:22,960
these companies

639
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:26,000
i would now refer to as red tech a

640
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,640
country like india is being profited by

641
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,960
headwinds from both big tech and from

642
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,880
red tech and

643
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:35,919
in many ways our democratic future in

644
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:37,600
the rest of the world

645
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:40,640
is being shaped by these two definitive

646
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,320
ecosystems

647
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:44,799
that are uh today overwhelming in their

648
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:46,880
presence and unrelenting in their

649
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:50,240
pursuit for eyeballs and for

650
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:52,159
your and my

651
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:56,080
purse wallet and preferences

652
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:58,480
in a paper i had recently uh in a paper

653
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:00,240
i really recently put together with a

654
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:03,840
colleague of mine uh i had tried to

655
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:06,400
piece together uh what are the threats

656
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,799
to democracy beyond

657
00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:10,559
much of what i just said

658
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:13,520
and much of what is uh common knowledge

659
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:16,159
what i what are the pain points what are

660
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:19,919
the issues that we must express uh

661
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:22,640
and we must find solutions to it

662
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:25,120
the first of course is that all major

663
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:27,520
social media platforms have the power to

664
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:30,400
curate promote and curtail

665
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,000
information

666
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,720
they can decide which citizen is heard

667
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:37,760
and who is censored they can cancel and

668
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:39,120
they can promote

669
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:40,320
they have

670
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:43,919
power over our minds and over our ideas

671
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:46,640
like never before this is unrivaled in

672
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:48,320
corporate history

673
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:51,120
while ustu while big oil while big

674
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:52,400
tobacco

675
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,960
were all dangerous and exerted immense

676
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:58,240
uh influence on our societies on our uh

677
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:00,400
on our choices and indeed on what we saw

678
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,240
what we heard and what we read

679
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:04,240
they were bought to heal by domestic

680
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:06,320
regulations by national governments

681
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:08,960
standard oil was splintered many other

682
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,640
companies were taken to task through

683
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:12,720
lawsuits and through constitutional

684
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:15,520
instruments but the transnational nature

685
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:17,279
of big tech

686
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:19,679
in different geographies makes it very

687
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:21,520
difficult to regulate them the

688
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:24,000
transnational character of tech and the

689
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,640
velocity of information make it a hard

690
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,240
to regulate sector

691
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:31,039
they can damage democracy before we can

692
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:33,520
have a file in place to deal with it and

693
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:36,559
this makes regulation of tech uh rather

694
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:37,600
difficult

695
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:40,960
daunting and indeed an imperative

696
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,080
let's look at what has happened in

697
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:44,000
recent times

698
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,200
big tech has declined declared

699
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:47,520
re-platformed political leaders

700
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:48,799
in the u.s

701
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:50,640
uh it has essential political leaders

702
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:51,919
across the world

703
00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:53,600
it has been taken based on internal

704
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:55,760
decisions of the company

705
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:58,000
it has not necessarily sought either a

706
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,720
global consensus or indeed any

707
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:03,279
constitutional approval while making

708
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:04,799
these big decisions

709
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:06,240
they have allowed the spread of

710
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:09,039
disinformation about covet 19 about

711
00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:10,880
vaccines they have allowed the spread of

712
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,840
hate speech because it is good for

713
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:16,159
business big platforms have taken cover

714
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:18,240
as a provider of public utility to

715
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:20,559
protect themselves against private

716
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:23,360
action or government interference and

717
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:25,679
yet they have behaved as private hosting

718
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:28,480
platforms to create rules for the club

719
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:30,559
that they believe are

720
00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:32,880
beneficial for their business models

721
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:34,720
they pick and choose

722
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,799
between being the public utility

723
00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:39,919
provider and a private enterprise

724
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:42,320
based on what they seek to achieve at

725
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:44,480
that particular moment

726
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:46,000
national governments of course are

727
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,919
beginning to respond to this

728
00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:49,679
they are beginning to find ways of

729
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:52,400
regulating technology companies and from

730
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:56,000
canberra to new delhi and the eu and

731
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,320
european countries all are grappling

732
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:00,480
with the right format of curtailing the

733
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:03,840
power of both big tech and red tech

734
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:06,080
chinese technologies are perhaps even

735
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:08,559
more dangerous at the end of the day

736
00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:10,880
private enterprises in the us can still

737
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:12,559
be regulated through american

738
00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:15,919
arrangements and we can perhaps hope for

739
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:19,360
a sense to prevail in capital hill to

740
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:21,440
bring to heal the powers that the

741
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:23,120
western uh

742
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:24,960
companies enjoy

743
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,720
china tech is accountable is

744
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:29,120
unaccountable at a different level

745
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:31,279
it is impossible for any citizen around

746
00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:33,440
the world to

747
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:36,480
reach out and reach decision makers

748
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:38,880
behind the great wall of china and

749
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:41,200
indeed now the great firewall of china

750
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:43,279
the communist party of chinese monopoly

751
00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:46,080
over decision making and the opacity of

752
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:48,320
their decision-making processes makes

753
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:50,720
china tech even more dangerous

754
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:54,320
it is impossible for a individual in any

755
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:57,120
city of the world to

756
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:58,320
reach out

757
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:02,159
lobby and see changes in chinese policy

758
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:04,640
american tech however can still be

759
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:07,120
challenged by citizens from anywhere

760
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:08,720
around the world

761
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:11,679
irrespective both of them pose a clear

762
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:14,799
and present danger to our societies and

763
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:15,840
our

764
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,919
way of life

765
00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:20,799
artificial intelligence emerging

766
00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:23,679
technologies quantum capabilities

767
00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:25,360
and of course

768
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:26,320
the

769
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:28,399
digitalization of all our personal

770
00:27:28,399 --> 00:27:29,440
information

771
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:31,279
are going to make this challenge even

772
00:27:31,279 --> 00:27:32,640
greater

773
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:35,679
not only can our expression and our

774
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:39,200
ideas be shaped but even our health

775
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,880
and our right to life

776
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:43,279
be infringed

777
00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:45,440
the data that exists

778
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:47,440
in the repositories of private sector

779
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:49,760
today

780
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:51,200
is a weapon

781
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:54,240
in unregulated hands

782
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,960
they can decide if i deserve an

783
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:59,360
insurance they can decide if i need to

784
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:01,840
board a plane they can decide if i

785
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:02,720
should

786
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,559
have access to certain public services

787
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:07,279
and utilities

788
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,240
i have not elected these private sector

789
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:13,520
companies and yet they today have

790
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:15,200
influence

791
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:16,480
on my life

792
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:19,520
akin to what governments did in previous

793
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:21,600
centuries

794
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:24,480
what is even more dangerous

795
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:27,840
is the transnational character

796
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:30,320
of these digital platforms and tech

797
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:34,080
companies from the us from eu from china

798
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:36,399
from india and elsewhere

799
00:28:36,399 --> 00:28:38,240
their ability to interfere in each

800
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:40,240
other's public spheres

801
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:42,720
to gain each other's political systems

802
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:45,679
to delegitimize governments to criticize

803
00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:48,960
national policies to mobilize national

804
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:51,679
resistance and national

805
00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:54,480
cohorts against their own governments

806
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:56,880
makes democracy clumsy and messy in

807
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:58,480
today's world

808
00:28:58,480 --> 00:28:59,919
again

809
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:01,520
while the chinese have the great

810
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:03,279
firewall of china

811
00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:05,360
and we are unable to participate in

812
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:07,520
their public conversations

813
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:09,279
they are able

814
00:29:09,279 --> 00:29:12,320
to implicate ours

815
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:14,480
their handles on twitter

816
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:17,039
their avatars on different digital

817
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:19,600
platforms participate

818
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:22,240
in others conversations

819
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:24,960
there is no reciprocity

820
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:28,000
the chinese participate in indian

821
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
affairs in the affairs of the united

822
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
states in the affairs of the european

823
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,240
union

824
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:36,559
they are able to create trends they are

825
00:29:36,559 --> 00:29:39,360
able to create hashtags that challenge

826
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:41,840
some of the national consensus they are

827
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:44,399
able to be critical and sometimes they

828
00:29:44,399 --> 00:29:46,720
are also able to inject falsehood and

829
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:48,720
lies

830
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:51,120
but since we are unable to do that in

831
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:53,679
their ecosystems it's an unlevel playing

832
00:29:53,679 --> 00:29:54,640
field

833
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:56,720
international interference in public

834
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:58,880
spheres of national

835
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:02,159
societies localities communities is

836
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:04,240
dangerous and sometimes we overlook it

837
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:06,960
to our own detriment

838
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:09,600
according to freeramas china has used

839
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:12,480
its technological capabilities in tandem

840
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:14,559
with its economic and political power to

841
00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:16,880
launch massive influence operations that

842
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:19,440
is gaming democracies from the inside

843
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:22,399
out from the question of taiwan

844
00:30:22,399 --> 00:30:23,760
on the issue of

845
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:25,360
covet 19

846
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:27,520
on other matters of political relevance

847
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:31,120
for the chinese they have perverted our

848
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:33,679
national debates across the global

849
00:30:33,679 --> 00:30:35,440
landscape

850
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:38,640
but beyond the influence operations and

851
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:39,360
the

852
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:42,000
dangers of manipulating data that affect

853
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,480
each individual

854
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:48,000
the biggest change that is unfolding is

855
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:48,720
the

856
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:52,559
compromise of our social contract with

857
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:54,880
our own dominance

858
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:57,200
many of the essential elements of human

859
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:58,480
existence

860
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:01,440
were guaranteed by our constitutions and

861
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:04,159
by our national regulations

862
00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:07,840
those who we elected in our countries

863
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:10,000
in our states in our provinces were

864
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,320
responsible for delivery of these

865
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:14,399
essential lifeline

866
00:31:14,399 --> 00:31:18,640
and perhaps even lifestyle requirements

867
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:19,760
today

868
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:21,840
much of these lifeline and lifestyle

869
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:23,200
requirements are delivered by the

870
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:25,200
private sector are delivered through

871
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:29,200
digital means and are in many sense uh

872
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:31,279
more distant

873
00:31:31,279 --> 00:31:33,440
in terms of accountability

874
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:36,480
and in terms of corrective action

875
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:38,320
from those who they serve than ever

876
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:40,639
before

877
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:45,039
regulations are unable to reign in

878
00:31:45,039 --> 00:31:47,120
those who deliver to us our most

879
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:49,600
important needs

880
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:50,640
in fact

881
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:52,640
enforcing regulation

882
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:55,760
is nearly impossible in a polarized

883
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:57,840
political system

884
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:00,000
democracies and polarization of

885
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,279
democracies

886
00:32:01,279 --> 00:32:04,000
allows and gives a free pass to tech

887
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,919
companies

888
00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:07,919
they gave these cleavages that exist

889
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:10,159
today and are able

890
00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:11,600
to create

891
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:14,799
escape mechanisms that prevent scrutiny

892
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:17,120
and prevent regulations that can take

893
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:18,960
them

894
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:20,720
democracy

895
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:22,399
is turning on itself

896
00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:25,200
technology is the tool

897
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:27,440
the weaponization of technology

898
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:29,360
against those who have allowed

899
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:32,399
ecosystems to innovate

900
00:32:32,399 --> 00:32:34,720
and invest in such technologies is the

901
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:36,559
single biggest challenge

902
00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:38,799
that we all face

903
00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:40,880
if democracy has to survive

904
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:44,320
technology will have to be taken

905
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:46,880
technology

906
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:49,679
and its role in our society faces

907
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:52,000
a few

908
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,080
headwinds

909
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:56,320
and we have to confront them and

910
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:57,360
acknowledge

911
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:58,880
that they are important

912
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:01,440
if our digital societies

913
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:03,760
remain are to remain democratic and

914
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:06,559
plural if democracy has to thrive in the

915
00:33:06,559 --> 00:33:08,480
fourth industrial revolution we will

916
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:11,360
have to confront challenges

917
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:12,320
that

918
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:15,360
technology has induced into our daily

919
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:17,919
affairs the first of course is the

920
00:33:17,919 --> 00:33:19,519
crisis of trust

921
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:22,159
technology companies and technologies

922
00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:24,640
are generally distrusted

923
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:26,880
those who run these companies

924
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:28,960
in the private sector and countries who

925
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:31,760
advance these technologies such as china

926
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:35,360
are also deeply distrusted and yet

927
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:38,720
because they are critical to our daily

928
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:41,440
lives to our careers and employment

929
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:43,279
needs and to our

930
00:33:43,279 --> 00:33:45,120
desire to remain connected with our

931
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:47,120
family and friends they are still

932
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:50,080
essential and are embraced

933
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:50,840
by

934
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:53,039
all this

935
00:33:53,039 --> 00:33:55,279
dichotomy between trust

936
00:33:55,279 --> 00:33:56,880
and need

937
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:58,960
is creating officials

938
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:01,360
and we need sensible regulations if

939
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:04,080
these need to be overcome

940
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:08,000
trust in technology is not a euphemism

941
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
it is an imperative if our digital

942
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,719
societies need to be protected

943
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:15,199
we need to have accountable boardrooms

944
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:17,520
perhaps even elected ones

945
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:20,560
companies that provide for

946
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:23,359
many of our important needs

947
00:34:23,359 --> 00:34:24,560
need to be accountable to the

948
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:27,199
communities they serve

949
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:29,679
transnational corporations need to have

950
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:32,320
the next level of responsibility

951
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:34,639
you cannot have selective

952
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:35,520
uh

953
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:38,320
regulations that serve the developed

954
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:40,879
world but ignore the developing world

955
00:34:40,879 --> 00:34:43,199
the same standards of accountability

956
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:44,000
that

957
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,079
some of the big american tech technology

958
00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:47,839
companies offer to citizens in the

959
00:34:47,839 --> 00:34:50,000
united states of america must also be

960
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,560
available in vietnam in bangladesh in

961
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:55,280
india and in other geographies

962
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:57,280
and if you are unable to do this they

963
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:59,440
will be seen as a foreign agent

964
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:03,800
interfering in local conversations

965
00:35:03,839 --> 00:35:06,640
i worry that at some point

966
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:08,640
these tech platforms that have so deeply

967
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:10,000
connected us

968
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,720
are going to be distrusted and perhaps

969
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:13,760
even

970
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:16,079
prevented from operating in many

971
00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:17,920
geographies around the world

972
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:20,480
trust is essential trust between

973
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:22,560
technology companies and sovereigns

974
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:24,240
trust between technology companies and

975
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:26,320
users and of course trust between

976
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:28,880
technology companies and society and we

977
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:31,200
must distinguish between users and

978
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:33,759
society

979
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:39,118
the second crisis is legitimacy

980
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:40,480
and this is

981
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:42,560
very relevant to

982
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:43,359
any

983
00:35:43,359 --> 00:35:45,839
functional democratic system

984
00:35:45,839 --> 00:35:49,520
an illegitimate actor in a public sphere

985
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:53,680
does not lend itself to good democracy

986
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:55,280
many of these

987
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:57,680
platforms many of these technology

988
00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:00,079
companies many of their activities from

989
00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:01,599
censorship to promotion from

990
00:36:01,599 --> 00:36:04,160
advertisements to canceling

991
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:07,280
actors and voices are all illegitimate

992
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:09,599
in the eyes of most

993
00:36:09,599 --> 00:36:11,040
you could be on either side of the

994
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:13,440
political spectrum today all of you have

995
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:15,520
agreements all of us have agreements

996
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:17,599
with technology companies and directions

997
00:36:17,599 --> 00:36:19,920
they are seen to be whimsical they seem

998
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:22,480
to be based on the choice and preference

999
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:24,960
of the proprietor owner or the largest

1000
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:26,720
shareholder that manages these tech

1001
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:29,440
platforms legitimacy is crucial for

1002
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:31,839
democracy and many of these are

1003
00:36:31,839 --> 00:36:33,599
functioning at the borders of such

1004
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:35,440
legitimacy

1005
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:37,359
many of the big technology platforms

1006
00:36:37,359 --> 00:36:38,880
have been designed and developed in the

1007
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:40,800
united states and of course increasingly

1008
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:43,440
some in china as well

1009
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:45,359
the big tech companies from the west

1010
00:36:45,359 --> 00:36:48,000
coast seek to promote and reinforce

1011
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,079
american liberal democratic values

1012
00:36:50,079 --> 00:36:53,200
worldwide but outside the u.s democratic

1013
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:55,920
values are not similar and they change

1014
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:57,839
their application is contingent on local

1015
00:36:57,839 --> 00:37:00,640
context as other societies experiences

1016
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:02,480
with political mobilization social

1017
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:03,599
divisions

1018
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:05,839
violence and cultural diversity is

1019
00:37:05,839 --> 00:37:08,560
different to that of the us

1020
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:10,079
and in some ways

1021
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:11,839
rules that may work for a medical

1022
00:37:11,839 --> 00:37:13,760
society may be

1023
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:17,920
inadequate in other geographies

1024
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:20,000
and in that sense

1025
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:23,119
the legitimacy of american style norms

1026
00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:24,400
being applied

1027
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:27,760
to different nations is questioning

1028
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:30,079
we have to

1029
00:37:30,079 --> 00:37:32,560
go back

1030
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:34,640
to the very

1031
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:37,040
early years of the formation of

1032
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:38,480
societies

1033
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:40,480
of communities of tribes

1034
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:43,760
of villages town cities and countries

1035
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:46,560
and recognize

1036
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:50,160
that those who collected

1037
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:52,960
and live together

1038
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:54,960
would largely

1039
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:56,720
subscribe to

1040
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:58,320
similar world views

1041
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:00,400
similar assessments of who they were

1042
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:03,200
similar assessments of what they needed

1043
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:06,079
what they ate how they dressed

1044
00:38:06,079 --> 00:38:08,880
their music preferences their cultural

1045
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:11,200
choices

1046
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:13,119
over time

1047
00:38:13,119 --> 00:38:15,440
was similar

1048
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:17,760
they gave themselves

1049
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:20,720
the same constitution

1050
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:22,640
the same law books

1051
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:24,400
and they managed their affairs through

1052
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:26,880
same laws

1053
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:29,440
they were not

1054
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:31,200
like their neighboring country they were

1055
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:32,880
different

1056
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:34,400
they were certainly not like the united

1057
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:37,200
states of america

1058
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:41,440
and if american law under the guard of

1059
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:44,400
digital connectivity

1060
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:47,359
seeds

1061
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:50,240
to impose itself on these societies

1062
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:51,680
which were clearly different and meant

1063
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:53,280
to be different

1064
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:55,359
there is a collision

1065
00:38:55,359 --> 00:38:56,880
of conformities

1066
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:59,119
the homogenization

1067
00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:01,839
that has been achieved

1068
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:04,160
through technology or that is thought to

1069
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:07,119
be achieved by technology is in direct

1070
00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:08,800
conflict

1071
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,160
with the diversity that has been

1072
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:13,879
protected through millennia

1073
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:17,440
we are seeing a conflict

1074
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:18,720
between

1075
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:20,880
conformity sought by technology

1076
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:21,920
companies

1077
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:24,160
and diversity

1078
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:26,839
celebrated through

1079
00:39:26,839 --> 00:39:29,359
centuries technology will have to

1080
00:39:29,359 --> 00:39:31,680
respect diversity

1081
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:34,079
technology does not

1082
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:35,680
acknowledge

1083
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:37,119
these cultural

1084
00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:38,400
contexts

1085
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:40,560
and this is the third challenge

1086
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:43,200
that culture matters

1087
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:46,000
and individual choices

1088
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,880
matter even more

1089
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:50,160
and finally

1090
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:52,160
let me turn my attention

1091
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:54,880
for a few minutes to china

1092
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:58,079
the chinese communist party

1093
00:39:58,079 --> 00:40:00,560
sees technology as an enabler of its

1094
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:02,720
control influence and power

1095
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:05,040
it has leveraged the services of its

1096
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:07,280
domestic technology giants like alibaba

1097
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:10,000
sense time magni for targeted facial

1098
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,560
recognition it has used ai and big data

1099
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:14,880
and genetic testing against wigars

1100
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:17,040
ethnic minorities in xinjiang and of

1101
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:18,960
course those who disagree with the

1102
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:20,480
regime

1103
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:22,720
but the chinese use of technology is not

1104
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:25,359
just to control its domestic population

1105
00:40:25,359 --> 00:40:26,960
and its local

1106
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:28,000
people

1107
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,599
it is also

1108
00:40:29,599 --> 00:40:32,560
a means of mischief abroad

1109
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:33,599
chinese

1110
00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:36,240
see technology as a great means for

1111
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:39,040
election interference for breaching the

1112
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:41,520
political processes for targeting

1113
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:43,119
infrastructure

1114
00:40:43,119 --> 00:40:45,760
uh for targeting key installations and

1115
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:46,560
for

1116
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:49,680
creating narratives and discussions that

1117
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:52,880
are inevitable to free societies

1118
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:54,960
there have been multiple attacks on

1119
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:56,400
election

1120
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:58,720
and associated infrastructure in europe

1121
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:00,720
and in countries in the indo-pacific

1122
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:03,680
since 2018 all of these have been traced

1123
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:06,800
back to chinese action the weaponization

1124
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:08,000
of tech

1125
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,280
to target

1126
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:12,240
democracy is a clear agenda for the for

1127
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:15,919
the communist party of china

1128
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:18,880
besides the attack on the

1129
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:21,680
election infrastructure

1130
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:23,440
the

1131
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:24,720
redesigning

1132
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:25,599
of

1133
00:41:25,599 --> 00:41:28,480
the public sphere in free societies is

1134
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:31,920
the second most important objective

1135
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:34,640
from fake news

1136
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:37,040
to the fakes

1137
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:37,760
to

1138
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:40,319
a troll army

1139
00:41:40,319 --> 00:41:41,920
chinese

1140
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:43,440
are ensuring

1141
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:46,880
that they are part of any conversation

1142
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:49,520
any political discussion in free

1143
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:53,680
societies and democratic countries

1144
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:55,359
in old times

1145
00:41:55,359 --> 00:41:57,359
in the

1146
00:41:57,359 --> 00:42:02,000
physical town square or in a biaba

1147
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,160
the conversations that unfolded that

1148
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:06,480
many times shaped our politics and

1149
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:08,720
indeed our choices

1150
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:11,680
did not have the perverse influence of

1151
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:13,920
outside voices

1152
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:14,800
today

1153
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:16,880
the beer bars

1154
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:20,720
or the digital public squares or even

1155
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:23,680
the google hangouts and others continue

1156
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:25,520
to witness

1157
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:28,079
external

1158
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:29,440
insertions

1159
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:33,200
external influence and external ideas

1160
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:34,640
being

1161
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:36,000
made part of

1162
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:39,920
largely local and domestic fields

1163
00:42:41,839 --> 00:42:44,560
the game the social divisions

1164
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:47,280
they gain grievances

1165
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:50,240
they see a polarized ecosystems in the

1166
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:52,560
us in india in other democratic

1167
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:54,720
societies

1168
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:56,400
and they widen

1169
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:59,560
the cleavage

1170
00:42:59,839 --> 00:43:02,160
instead of reconciliation

1171
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:03,680
we are seeing

1172
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:05,040
china tech

1173
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:08,640
invest in the divisions

1174
00:43:09,359 --> 00:43:12,400
the business model of china tech is to

1175
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:14,480
divide democracies

1176
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:16,880
within and outside

1177
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:19,440
and this is the second objective

1178
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:23,839
mischief abroad is a business model

1179
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:27,359
and finally the china brand

1180
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:29,200
we saw last year

1181
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:31,119
during covet 19.

1182
00:43:31,119 --> 00:43:32,880
and in fact this is something that is

1183
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:34,480
available in many studies across the

1184
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:35,520
world

1185
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:38,560
the chinese brand continued to do better

1186
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:41,359
than any democratic nation

1187
00:43:41,359 --> 00:43:43,599
they were able to gain the news cycle

1188
00:43:43,599 --> 00:43:45,599
they were able to buy

1189
00:43:45,599 --> 00:43:49,119
media headlines in space in western and

1190
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:50,480
other

1191
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:52,960
media systems they were able to dominate

1192
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:55,440
the channels and they were able to

1193
00:43:55,440 --> 00:44:00,160
serve our social platforms and ensure

1194
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:01,440
that they were

1195
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:02,400
never

1196
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:04,720
made to be accountable for what happened

1197
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:07,599
in mohan and what we

1198
00:44:07,599 --> 00:44:09,040
to all endure

1199
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:11,359
for over two years

1200
00:44:11,359 --> 00:44:14,640
but that is not what should scare us

1201
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:18,079
china's progress and its deployment

1202
00:44:18,079 --> 00:44:21,359
of its technology for its own purposes

1203
00:44:21,359 --> 00:44:24,240
is indeed dangerous but what is more

1204
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:25,359
worrisome

1205
00:44:25,359 --> 00:44:26,960
is that china tech

1206
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:28,960
is now very attractive to many

1207
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:31,280
geographies

1208
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:34,079
the recent actions

1209
00:44:34,079 --> 00:44:37,280
biotechnology platforms

1210
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:39,920
against russia

1211
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:41,359
of

1212
00:44:41,359 --> 00:44:44,640
removing russian voices and handles and

1213
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:45,839
propaganda

1214
00:44:45,839 --> 00:44:49,359
of working together to ensure technology

1215
00:44:49,359 --> 00:44:51,839
platforms did not have to

1216
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:53,920
we were not amplifying

1217
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:57,040
falsehoods and lies

1218
00:44:58,240 --> 00:45:01,279
it raises a question

1219
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:04,640
can be same platforms work together and

1220
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:07,280
ensure chinese propaganda

1221
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:09,599
is offloaded

1222
00:45:09,599 --> 00:45:11,200
can they prevent amplification of

1223
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:13,280
chinese lies can they take action

1224
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:15,760
against chinese

1225
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:18,560
falsehoods and chinese

1226
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:20,800
manipulation

1227
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:23,200
or when chinese economically or make

1228
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:25,440
these platforms incapable of taking the

1229
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:27,280
stand

1230
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:30,560
what we need to do together

1231
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:33,119
is apparent

1232
00:45:33,119 --> 00:45:34,480
countries

1233
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:37,280
need to have serious conversations

1234
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:39,359
on managing

1235
00:45:39,359 --> 00:45:42,079
the unaccountable influence

1236
00:45:42,079 --> 00:45:45,119
that tech companies

1237
00:45:45,119 --> 00:45:46,960
possessed today

1238
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:49,359
sensible national regulations need to

1239
00:45:49,359 --> 00:45:51,359
make technology companies

1240
00:45:51,359 --> 00:45:52,800
partner the state

1241
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:54,720
and not in opposition to it

1242
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:58,400
to serve society and not pervert it

1243
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:00,960
to protect the individual and not harm

1244
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:02,800
however him

1245
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:04,560
we need to rethink

1246
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:07,119
our regulatory design across the world

1247
00:46:07,119 --> 00:46:08,800
in managing big tech

1248
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:09,760
second

1249
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:12,240
we need to have a transnational

1250
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:15,280
partnership and agreement on managing

1251
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:16,960
transnational corporations and their

1252
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:20,079
implications for different geographies

1253
00:46:20,079 --> 00:46:21,839
we will have

1254
00:46:21,839 --> 00:46:23,520
to find a framework

1255
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:25,440
that allows

1256
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:27,760
different assessments

1257
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:30,160
of human spaces that celebrates

1258
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:32,480
diversity and that understands and

1259
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:35,280
officiates cultural contexts

1260
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:38,160
one size must not fit all one size can

1261
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:39,760
not fit all

1262
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:42,000
facebook in india will have to have a

1263
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,079
very different texture

1264
00:46:44,079 --> 00:46:45,280
than meta

1265
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:48,160
in the united states

1266
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:49,920
twitter and its operations will have to

1267
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:52,240
be sensitized

1268
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:54,319
to the preferences of the japanese even

1269
00:46:54,319 --> 00:46:55,680
as they

1270
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:57,760
have their home base

1271
00:46:57,760 --> 00:47:00,640
in silicon valley

1272
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:03,040
international regulations

1273
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:05,839
will have to use

1274
00:47:05,839 --> 00:47:08,079
a far more empathetic

1275
00:47:08,079 --> 00:47:08,839
and

1276
00:47:08,839 --> 00:47:11,520
sensitive national framework as they

1277
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:13,839
operate in different geographies

1278
00:47:13,839 --> 00:47:16,160
and third

1279
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:18,480
we must realize

1280
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:20,480
that our digital world

1281
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:21,680
is now

1282
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:23,839
a world in

1283
00:47:23,839 --> 00:47:26,240
and many of the learnings

1284
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:27,040
from

1285
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:30,319
terra forma have to be applied

1286
00:47:30,319 --> 00:47:32,960
to our digital existence

1287
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:34,400
reciprocity

1288
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:39,680
has to be an ethic that we must embrace

1289
00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:41,280
for example

1290
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:43,520
we must not allow authoritarian actors

1291
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:46,000
to gain a public sphere if we are denied

1292
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:49,359
access to theirs it is time to offload

1293
00:47:49,359 --> 00:47:52,000
chinese handles and chinese propaganda

1294
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,640
from our digital world unless we are

1295
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:56,960
allowed to participate in theirs and

1296
00:47:56,960 --> 00:47:58,400
challenge the writ of the communist

1297
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:00,880
party amongst the chinese society the

1298
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:03,680
chinese digital society

1299
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:06,160
if we are banned there they must be

1300
00:48:06,160 --> 00:48:07,839
cancelled here

1301
00:48:07,839 --> 00:48:10,400
since we will not allow a chinese

1302
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:11,920
government to have an embassy in our

1303
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:13,520
country unless we have an embassy in

1304
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:16,000
theirs it is time the same ethic of

1305
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,839
reciprocity is implemented

1306
00:48:18,839 --> 00:48:21,920
online democracies have

1307
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:23,599
an advantage

1308
00:48:23,599 --> 00:48:25,520
they have an advantage to be able to

1309
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:28,400
harness the power of the many

1310
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:29,599
they have the

1311
00:48:29,599 --> 00:48:31,680
ability to cost correct

1312
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:34,000
and they have the strength of devising

1313
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:35,599
new solutions

1314
00:48:35,599 --> 00:48:37,440
when times are tough

1315
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:39,599
we are going through a difficult decade

1316
00:48:39,599 --> 00:48:41,280
where technology has been weaponized

1317
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:43,680
against democracy

1318
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:45,920
we need social sciences to work with

1319
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:48,160
sciences we want coders to work with

1320
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:50,319
politicians we want politicians to

1321
00:48:50,319 --> 00:48:52,880
understand technology

1322
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:54,720
we need more of all

1323
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:57,839
and we need to work together

1324
00:48:57,839 --> 00:48:59,599
bottom lines

1325
00:48:59,599 --> 00:49:02,000
are useful matrix for measurement of

1326
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:03,440
success

1327
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:06,559
but stability and resilience of nations

1328
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:08,319
and societies

1329
00:49:08,319 --> 00:49:10,160
is the only lasting guarantee of

1330
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:12,240
prosperity

1331
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:17,839
technology now must invest in prosperity

1332
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:29,040
you can see uh samir has some pretty big

1333
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:30,559
thoughts

1334
00:49:30,559 --> 00:49:32,160
and he addresses some really large

1335
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:33,599
problems and that's what i like to do

1336
00:49:33,599 --> 00:49:36,160
with keynotes at black hat

1337
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:37,599
is to try to expose you to the bigger

1338
00:49:37,599 --> 00:49:39,040
thoughts and the bigger pressures that

1339
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:42,480
you may be seeing at the periphery

1340
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:44,000
but you don't ever get a chance to fully

1341
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,559
explore the rest of black hat the rest

1342
00:49:46,559 --> 00:49:48,079
of your profession in your day job you

1343
00:49:48,079 --> 00:49:50,160
might be really in the trenches

1344
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:52,160
challenged with some technical

1345
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:53,440
uh problem

1346
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:54,960
threat hunting

1347
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:57,599
grounding down a rabbit hole but really

1348
00:49:57,599 --> 00:49:59,680
when i start the sessions off i really

1349
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:02,079
want you to kind of start broad

1350
00:50:02,079 --> 00:50:03,920
try to position yourself

1351
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:05,839
where do you fit where does your company

1352
00:50:05,839 --> 00:50:08,319
fit in the global perspective

1353
00:50:08,319 --> 00:50:10,400
and then you narrow down and then you do

1354
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:12,640
your one thing that maybe you get paid

1355
00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:14,160
to do

1356
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:16,960
but that doesn't mean you should be

1357
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:18,559
not aware

1358
00:50:18,559 --> 00:50:20,720
of the environment right situational

1359
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:22,720
awareness is is king

1360
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:23,680
so

1361
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:26,559
i'm glad that samir delivered on that

1362
00:50:26,559 --> 00:50:28,160
now before we kick off our next sessions

1363
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:29,599
i've just got a couple of

1364
00:50:29,599 --> 00:50:32,480
housekeeping notes

1365
00:50:32,559 --> 00:50:34,559
when you leave out the back our next

1366
00:50:34,559 --> 00:50:36,880
session will start in here at

1367
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:39,520
10 20.

1368
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:41,520
opposite this room is what we call the

1369
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:43,200
business hall

1370
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:45,920
it's where all the uh supporters and

1371
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:47,119
vendors

1372
00:50:47,119 --> 00:50:48,640
are demoing things it's where coffee

1373
00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:51,280
breaks will be it's also where tonight

1374
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:54,640
they'll be at 4 30 our reception

1375
00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:56,000
so if you go in there and check it out

1376
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:57,359
just think i'm going to come back here

1377
00:50:57,359 --> 00:50:59,119
at 4 30 this evening and that's we're

1378
00:50:59,119 --> 00:51:00,400
going to have a reception for everybody

1379
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:02,480
who's attended black hat it's a good

1380
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:03,839
chance to meet your other colleagues

1381
00:51:03,839 --> 00:51:05,280
kind of unwind

1382
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:07,920
also tonight i'm doing a lock note

1383
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:10,559
session so if this was the keynote this

1384
00:51:10,559 --> 00:51:12,400
evening is the lock

1385
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:14,319
and this is an area where we get the

1386
00:51:14,319 --> 00:51:16,240
review board members who help select the

1387
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:17,599
content for black hat we all get

1388
00:51:17,599 --> 00:51:19,119
together sit down

1389
00:51:19,119 --> 00:51:21,119
and have a conversation

1390
00:51:21,119 --> 00:51:23,119
and it's not really a panel it's more

1391
00:51:23,119 --> 00:51:25,280
like me asking them their opinions and

1392
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:26,640
the concept is that you're in the

1393
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:27,599
audience

1394
00:51:27,599 --> 00:51:29,760
watching subject matter experts

1395
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:31,920
have a beer have a conversation and you

1396
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:33,520
get to hear about

1397
00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:35,520
what's interesting to them and then

1398
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:37,119
about halfway through the lock note

1399
00:51:37,119 --> 00:51:39,760
session you get to join the conversation

1400
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:42,400
you get to start asking questions

1401
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:44,880
get feedback it just is a nice social

1402
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:47,920
way to end down a very technical day of

1403
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:50,319
conference proceedings

1404
00:51:50,319 --> 00:51:51,839

1405
00:51:51,839 --> 00:51:53,359
