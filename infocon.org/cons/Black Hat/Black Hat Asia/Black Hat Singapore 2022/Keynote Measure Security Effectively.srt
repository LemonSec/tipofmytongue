00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:04,810
[Music]

2
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:11,040
hey good morning everyone

3
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:12,719
welcome to day two of black hat

4
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:14,400
singapore

5
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,800
um i hope you had a good time last night

6
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,119
it's fantastic at the at the mbs here

7
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:20,400
had some great meals some great

8
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,480
conversations uh the reception was

9
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:23,439
really good

10
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:25,119
place to connect

11
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:26,960
and uh we're gonna have another uh

12
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:28,800
closing session uh this evening i'll

13
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:32,159
tell you about um a little bit later

14
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:33,600
but first i just want to talk a little

15
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,719
bit about people people and processes

16
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:38,879
and as you're at the day sessions and

17
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:40,239
you're leaning learning about a lot of

18
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:43,840
technical hypertechnical sessions

19
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:46,879
solutions vulnerabilities

20
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:47,840
just think a little bit about your

21
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:50,480
people your processes

22
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:52,239
and the tools you have them using

23
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:53,840
because today

24
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:55,360
for our keynote session we're going to

25
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:57,360
be talking about a bit about people and

26
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:59,280
technology and measurement

27
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,440
and you're trying to find that fit

28
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:05,039
between how do you create a

29
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:07,760
right sized spend to have an effective

30
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:09,200
team and to do that you're going to need

31
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:13,280
some sort of measurements or metrics

32
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:14,799
and so what i'm going to do here is i'm

33
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:16,880
going to introduce

34
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:19,840
a large supporter of black hat

35
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:21,520
sneak

36
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:23,520
sneaks head of solutions engineering

37
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:24,720
lawrence crowther is going to get up and

38
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,479
talk a little bit about developer

39
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:29,040
focused security your people

40
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,479
your processes

41
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:34,000
and there's this accelerating trend as

42
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:34,799
as

43
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:36,159
i talked a little bit yesterday about

44
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:39,119
speed as we speed up or as we are forced

45
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:41,520
to speed up some of these cycles are

46
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,360
accelerating things that used to be two

47
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:45,920
separate processes are being forced

48
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,799
together to become one process

49
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:50,320
and what does that mean

50
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:53,520
right if if security engineers have to

51
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:54,799
essentially become developers and

52
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:56,479
developers have to become security

53
00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:57,680
engineers or certain things are

54
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:58,960
collapsing

55
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,719
what does that mean

56
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:03,280
so it's my pleasure to introduce

57
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,040
lawrence krauther give us some thoughts

58
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,840
on this thank you

59
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:12,560
[Applause]

60
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,400
thanks jeff i appreciate that welcome

61
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,440
everyone i want to ask you a question

62
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,520
should we trust developers to handle

63
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,800
security

64
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,720
and if we do

65
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:25,440
should we allow them to also download

66
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,200
various open source code and include it

67
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,440
in our own software supply chain when we

68
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,120
know security professionals it's

69
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,360
probably riddled with vulnerabilities

70
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,560
now

71
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,599
let's just say we can't trust developers

72
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:39,680
what does that look like

73
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:42,400
well it would mean we would have to

74
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,720
trust the security team to handle it all

75
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:46,400
they don't have the bandwidth nor the

76
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,480
resources and they would become

77
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,720
the bottleneck

78
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,239
and if we lock everything down and don't

79
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:54,879
let developers bring in open source

80
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:56,480
they would need to create everything

81
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:57,680
from scratch

82
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:00,319
and create more first-party

83
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:03,280
custom or proprietary code

84
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,680
which would probably contain

85
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,599
just the same number of vulnerabilities

86
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:09,440
if not more so you haven't really

87
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:12,080
achieved anything there

88
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,760
so i argue that

89
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,280
you should trust developers to handle

90
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,519
security and furthermore

91
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:19,120
if you don't

92
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,840
uh your company may be left behind and

93
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:25,280
you put could put your company at risk

94
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,319
so

95
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:27,840
the three fundamental reasons why i

96
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,440
think

97
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:30,959
you should trust developers to handle

98
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:33,519
security number one is simply the the

99
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:35,519
pace of innovation security teams just

100
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:37,040
can't keep up with the pace of

101
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,560
developers

102
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,840
number two

103
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,720
is that the ratio of developers to

104
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,799
security expert

105
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:46,239
in some companies there's like 100 to

106
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:48,159
one i've seen some organizations where

107
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:50,400
there's 100 developers to every one

108
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,159
application security expert and that

109
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:55,040
simply doesn't scale

110
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,879
and then finally as we know everything

111
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:58,879
is software your your network your

112
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:02,239
infrastructure your cloud configuration

113
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:04,879
and the trend is for

114
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:07,680
developers to create and manage all

115
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,840
those components using infrastructure as

116
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:12,080
code so it kind of makes sense for them

117
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:15,360
to also secure those components right

118
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,478
now i think

119
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:17,440
that

120
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:20,880
it may cause some friction between the

121
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,560
development and security teams with this

122
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,160
sort of extra burden

123
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,680
that developers now have with the

124
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,680
additional responsibility

125
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,199
but i think that if you find the right

126
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:32,000
balance between speed and safety

127
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,840
uh between the development and security

128
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:37,120
teams i think both teams will benefit

129
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,600
i mean of course good tooling always

130
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,479
helps right it's going to help remove

131
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:44,400
some of that burden from developers

132
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,919
remove a lot of the heavy lifting and

133
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:49,040
make them more productive

134
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51,680
if you want developers to actually

135
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,280
adopt

136
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,199
security tools it needs to actually look

137
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:56,560
like a developer tool something that

138
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,639
developers understand and can integrate

139
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:01,199
into their own workflow

140
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:04,960
less like a traditional security tool

141
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,880
what does all this mean for security

142
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,080
folks

143
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,840
well if you buy into the sort of popular

144
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:10,880
idea that

145
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,720
all companies are software companies

146
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,479
everyone's shifting to the cloud

147
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:15,440
then

148
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:18,960
the intersection of apps and cloud

149
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:22,320
is where security needs to focus

150
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,479
now within the organization you should

151
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:26,800
try and align the security team

152
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,240
which traditionally has been aligned

153
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:31,039
with central i.t

154
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:33,199
with a development organization for

155
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:36,240
example you can assign

156
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,160
one appsec person let's say with

157
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,120
multiple

158
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,880
development teams

159
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:43,280
and have them embedded in the projects

160
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,479
and

161
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:46,960
they can have a partner to reach out to

162
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:49,360
for advice and guidance around securing

163
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,199
their software

164
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:52,240
but i think ultimately it's going to

165
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,720
come down to both the security teams

166
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,000
and the development teams working

167
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,720
together to take responsibility of

168
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:02,319
security for developers this looks like

169
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:05,680
being thoughtful about security first

170
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:08,960
feeling empowered to own security

171
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:11,120
and for security teams

172
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,639
it means

173
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:14,560
no longer being that sort of controlling

174
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,560
or gating function

175
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,000
but more playing the supportive and

176
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,639
guidance type role to enable developers

177
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:22,160
to actually

178
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:25,840
fix security issues themselves

179
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:28,080
now i want to leave you with

180
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,199
the fact that

181
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:30,880
asia pacific and japan there's a massive

182
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,160
opportunity

183
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,479
in this space because we have two-thirds

184
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:36,400
of the world's developers we also have a

185
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,720
shortage of cyber security experts so it

186
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,400
kind of makes sense

187
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,600
for

188
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:44,000
more companies to sort of lean in on a

189
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,639
developer first security approach

190
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:48,800
something to think about as you attend

191
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:49,919
the sessions

192
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:52,400
here on day two of the conference

193
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,919
and as you're having discussions out in

194
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:55,840
the business hall thank you very much

195
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:58,260
and enjoy day two of the conference

196
00:06:58,260 --> 00:07:01,740
[Applause]

197
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,400
thank you

198
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:05,440
all right

199
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,120
we're going to move into our main

200
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,960
keynote session right now it's going to

201
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:11,360
be my pleasure to introduce you to the

202
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:14,639
day two keynote george doe

203
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:16,639
now george is the chief's information

204
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:19,440
security officer at go jack and go to

205
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:22,000
financial

206
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,840
like me he's a he's kind of transplanted

207
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,840
from north america

208
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:30,400
he has deep industry experience

209
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:31,520
i'll just tell you a little bit about

210
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:34,160
his his work history which is very

211
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,720
impressive and it shows you the the

212
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:39,360
technical and the sort of boardroom

213
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,120
skills necessary to advance to this

214
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,960
level

215
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,479
he was the chief security officer at

216
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:46,639
equinix where he built the global cyber

217
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:49,919
security program from the ground up

218
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:52,000
so from nothing to something right

219
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,240
that's a a certain skill set

220
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,639
um that's very important he previously

221
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:58,639
worked at exodus which is also known as

222
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:01,280
savas or centurylink another large

223
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,879
provider bandwidth provider

224
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:05,440
infrastructure provider

225
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:06,560
and so when i say infrastructure

226
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,000
provider what i'm also hinting at is

227
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,120
regulation governance right you it's not

228
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,800
a stand-alone company it's

229
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,120
interconnected with everything

230
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,280
um and

231
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,960
i was a financial supporter of one of

232
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:21,199
his companies before that tivo now for

233
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:22,720
many people you might not remember tivo

234
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:25,120
but the original digital

235
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:28,000
dvr recorder and that's how i consumed

236
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,400
my media in the early days before

237
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:33,200
pervasive streaming was tivo

238
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,799
where he also had security leadership

239
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:37,760
roles and he started off at nasa the

240
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:40,080
united states nasa where he worked with

241
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,240
the federal government to try to secure

242
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:45,760
nasa assets so a broad range of private

243
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:48,320
and governmental experience

244
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,800
and working from the trenches to the

245
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,519
board room and it's appropriate that his

246
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:55,040
keynote is going to be talking about

247
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,720
quantifying

248
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:59,200
security metrics moving the security

249
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,959
needle from the trenches to the board

250
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:02,000
room

251
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,399
you can't really act on something if you

252
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:06,880
can't measure it so with that said it is

253
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,560
my pleasure to introduce

254
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:09,530
george doe

255
00:09:09,530 --> 00:09:15,519
[Applause]

256
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:17,519

260
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,519
it out and maybe some of us had a late

261
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:26,800
night so we could make it out this

i'm here to share with you my experience

266
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:35,760
you know i've been doing security for a

267
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:38,160
long time and i've had my share of

268
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,959
battle scars and my goal today is to

269
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:42,240

270
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,320
throughout my journey and one of the

271
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,000
biggest you know one of the biggest

272
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,839
learnings i've had and throughout my

273
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:50,399
career has been how do you really know

274
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:52,640
you're moving to security detail all

275
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,560
your investments all of your hiring all

276
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,480
of your projects all of the blood sweat

277
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,720
and tears that the security staff puts

278
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:01,040
into the trenches does it matter

279
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:03,040
does it is it moving the needle is it

280
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,800
meaningful right

281
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,560
so i'm going to start friday with a

282
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:08,880
dilbert cartoon give give everybody a

283
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:11,040
second to read what this dilborg cartoon

284
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,360
is saying

285
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,040
by show of hands in the audience who who

286
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,399
do you believe that

287
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:20,720
that you are perceived as mordak the the

288
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,720
preventer of information services by

289
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,720
your organization

290
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,959
nobody would admit it right but

291
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:28,480
a brave soul has admitted it this

292
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:31,040
morning i would submit to you that many

293
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,959
of our organizations view the security

294
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:34,160
team

295
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:35,519
as mordak

296
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:38,480
we are cis no right that's what that

297
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,959
means right and and the joke here is hey

298
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:43,279
we we sometimes do things such in a

299
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:44,480
vacuum

300
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,560
that we don't understand the impact of

301
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,640
the business or at least understand you

302
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,240
know the pain points the business is

303
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,800
having and so the example is hey to log

304
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,399
into the computer stare directly at the

305
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:57,120
sun that's great right so hope you enjoy

306
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:59,040
the comic so real quick a little bit

307
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:01,680
about me uh i i i'm not gonna do a

308
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,120
deeper dive into this slide because i

309
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,360
think jeff did a great job introducing

310
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:08,399
me um you know i've been doing security

311
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:10,240
for a very long time since out of

312
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,560
college i started at nasa

313
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:13,600
um

314
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,480
you know

315
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:15,360
and

316
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,600
i i came from an engineering background

317
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:20,640
right which is interesting because

318
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,959
having becoming engineer and doing

319
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:25,760
security i formed a very

320
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:28,000
technical lens to the world my measure

321
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,240
of success for security was technical

322
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:33,519
firewalls networks forensics dfir all of

323
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:36,240
that good stuff but as i i

324
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,240
i progressed throughout my career i

325
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,000
learned there are other ways to measure

326
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,920
security that are equally important or

327
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:43,920
sometimes even more important but again

328
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:46,399
a little bit about me i've grown a love

329
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:49,760

330

00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:19,680
the this is the team that gets called in

344
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,440
when nasa gets hacked

345
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:24,000
so i had to piggyback investigations

346
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,600
with the fbi

347
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,760
the office inspector general

348
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:29,760
and back then we didn't have all these

349
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:32,000
cool whiz-bang cloud tools i actually

350
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
carried around a suitcase with hard

351
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,480
drive imaging kits and i used linux

352
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,959
distros and jeff is nodding here because

353
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:40,639
he knows all of these tools the corners

354
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:44,320
toolkit metasploit kali linux nopex and

355
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:46,000
you would have to take images of hard

356
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,680
drives with dd

357
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:50,000
and and and capture evidence and do

358
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,839
ethereal captures and all of that

359
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:53,839
evidence has to have a chain of custody

360
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:56,399
you have to take it to court testify and

361
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:58,240
prosecute the the hackers or the

362
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,399
individuals sorry the attackers not the

363
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:02,079
hackers right because there are white

364
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:04,399
there are white hats too right

365
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:07,120
so so i spent you know three years doing

366
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,959
this and working in the government with

367
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:11,680
fbi and and inspector general taught me

368
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:14,240
a lot uh in terms of hey

369
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:16,079
you know because we were government we

370
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:18,480
weren't profit driven we were research

371
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:21,519
based we were government-based so so the

372
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:23,040
goals of the government are very

373
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:25,519
different than that of private industry

374
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:28,480
but but where i where i came from is you

375
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,480
know i formed a very technical lens

376
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,800
early in my career and that

377
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:35,040
i would say was a blessing and a curse

378
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,880
throughout my career as i learned hey

379
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:39,279
there are other ways of looking at

380
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:41,920
security and how to measure security

381
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:42,880
right

382
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,880
so let's define the problem statement

383
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,480
right let's not talk in high in the

384
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:49,199
clouds let's let's talk about what

385
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:50,480
you know what specifically we're

386
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:52,000
addressing right

387
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,160
so again how do we know

388
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:56,560
our efforts are are making an impact to

389
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:58,160
our organization

390
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:00,000
right and why does this even why does

391
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,720
this even matter we often don't have

392
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,639
time to ask these questions but they're

393
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:07,680
critically important why because if we

394
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:10,480
don't what's at stake is we waste

395
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,480
millions of dollars in tech and man

396
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,720
hours tech spend and man hours

397
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:17,519
there's mistrust of the security team

398
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:19,279
everybody familiar with the term ivory

399
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:21,920
tower ivory tower of security where you

400
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:24,160
set up such a big bureaucracy of

401
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:26,800
security it's a checklist of no no no no

402
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,639
no and the business is just like oh my

403
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:30,800
god security is an ivory tower i do not

404
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,720
want to deal with the security team

405
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:36,079
that's an ivory tower right

406
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,959
you know what's also at stake is

407
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:40,480
you know we go into the boardroom and

408
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,480
the ceo and the executives and we ask

409
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:45,040
for budget how do we justify that budget

410
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:46,480
because at the end of the day the

411
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,480
business needs to know hey there needs

412
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,240
to be a return on investment on what

413
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:52,639
we're delivering right

414
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:54,399
and then and then finally i would say

415
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:56,959
probably the biggest risk is

416
00:14:56,959 --> 00:14:58,880
if we don't get this right

417
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:00,800
if we don't know if our efforts are

418
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:03,040
making a difference then the there's

419
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:05,040
increased cyber risk to the organization

420
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,720
which is what our main objective is

421
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:09,360
right all security professionals right

422
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,279
again the challenges right

423
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:13,279
security is a risk management game it's

424
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:14,560
subjective

425
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:16,560
right my opinion on what's high risk

426
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,800
versus yours may be very different it's

427
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,560
not the same so how do you make heads

428
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:21,920
and tails how do you come up with

429
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,839
something that's codified

430
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:24,880
right

431
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:27,040
and finally there are many ways to

432
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:29,680
measure security i can ask my sister my

433
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,759
dad my cousin my friends and they will

434
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:33,360
all give me different answers to the

435
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,199
same exact question

436
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:37,040
very difficult right

437
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,720
so that's the problem statement

438
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:41,680
so i kind of want to start by sharing um

439
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:44,720
a journey that i had with all of you

440
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:47,040
my first presentation to my board in

441
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:50,000
2014 i was asked hey we need to give a

442
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,720
presentation to our board on the secure

443
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,160
what is the state of the security

444
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:57,199
posture of the organization

445
00:15:57,199 --> 00:15:58,800
so

446
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,959
you know on the graphic here this is

447
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:02,399
meant to be an eye chart by the way so

448
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:04,160
you're not meant to read these these

449
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:06,399
words but but if you can be great again

450
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:07,920
these slides are made available after

451
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:09,680
the presentation so it'll be it'll be

452
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:12,079
made available but basically what i did

453
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:14,399
was i presented our security program

454
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:16,399
here's what we do with firewalls here's

455
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:18,560
our anti-virus here's what we do with

456
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:21,440
social engineering patching encryption

457
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,040
so on and so forth

458
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:25,440
and what i learned out of that first

459
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:28,399
board presentation was i was off it's

460
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:31,040
way off right i i went into the

461
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:34,079
boardroom with a very security lens

462
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:37,199
technical lens or or even a manager of a

463
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:40,320
technical lens and and i proceeded to

464
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:42,079
say hey these this is what the program

465
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:42,800
is

466
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,639
you should be happy with it we're doing

467
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:47,360
good but i didn't show any data i didn't

468
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:49,440
give any sense of hey did this move the

469
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,040
needle where did we come from where do

470
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:53,519
we need to get to how do we measure that

471
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:54,399
right

472
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:55,360
and so

473
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:56,800
some key takeaways that i would share

474
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:59,120
with you today right with board members

475
00:16:59,120 --> 00:16:59,839
is

476
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:01,279
board members are not technical that's

477
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:03,759
no surprise very smart leaders business

478
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:05,839
leaders very they understand risk they

479
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:07,439
understand the business they understand

480
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:09,520
the economics but they are not i.t

481
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:11,839
they're not security so you have to be

482
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:13,039
able to

483
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:15,919
speak in in that language and and in

484
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:17,199
terms that the board members will

485
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:18,559
understand

486
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:20,480
two simple but very effective is don't

487
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:23,359
use acronyms right we're all heads down

488
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:25,760
in our work we use all sorts of acronyms

489
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:27,919
don't expect people even board

490
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:29,600
especially board members to understand

491
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,600
what mfa is

492
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,360
right you got to spell it out simple but

493
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:35,039
very effective

494
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:38,080
number three is and this is very key um

495
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:41,360
the cio and cto often are dragged into

496
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:43,679
the boardroom along with the cso

497
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:46,320
to to to speak on hey how are we doing

498
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:48,160
with cyber security

499
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:51,360
right so there is always a risk of

500
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:53,600
adversarial relationships between the

501
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:57,440
cso and the ci cio and cto i i would

502
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:00,400
push the other way i'm saying no cio and

503
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:03,360
cto are advocates they are partners they

504
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:05,760
are stakeholders they're not adversaries

505
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:08,160
the purpose isn't for the csos to say

506
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,720
hey cio cto these are all the bad things

507
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,080
that are going on in your organization

508
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:14,799
you need to go fix it so so that sets up

509
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:16,880
an adversarial relationship

510
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:19,840
so in the board presentation we partner

511
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:22,720
to cso and the cio into cto we partner

512
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,320
in coming up with a presentation

513
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:26,320
together to present to the board so

514
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:28,640
whatever problems we call out there's a

515
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,480
plan of attack and how are we doing

516
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,240
against that plan of attack

517
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:34,320
right and then finally i would say this

518
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:36,960
is very important too is board members

519
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,799
are there to help they have skin in the

520
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:39,600
game

521
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,840
in in the us i don't know about in asia

522
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:44,640
i need to check but their board members

523
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,799
have what they call fiduciary duty

524
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:49,120
meaning if the organization gets hacked

525
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:51,840
or compromised and it's found that the

526
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:54,000
board members were not

527
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,840
focusing on that risk area for the

528
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:58,720
organization they can be held liable

529
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,960
right and and so and so they are there

530
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:03,840
to help you really use a board member to

531
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,840
help and then finally i would say i you

532
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,840
know after the first disastrous

533
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:09,679
presentation i had to the board

534
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:10,880
i um

535
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:12,480
i walked up to one board member and i

536
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:13,679
asked him hey

537
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:15,440
his name was um well i won't use his

538
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,120
name but i asked him hey did i make

539
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:19,520
sense does this does this presentation

540
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:22,240
resonate did you know and he sat me down

541
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:23,520
and said hey let's go have coffee i'll

542
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:25,679
talk to you and he gave me all of these

543
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:27,600
insights and i would have never learned

544
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,600
it or it would take me taken me very

545
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,120
long time to learn

546
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:33,600
on the insights but that one coffee

547
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:36,000
conversation really taught me oh there's

548
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,840
a very different lens that i need to

549
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:40,000
start learning on how to present

550
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,880
effectively to the board right so

551
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:45,360
again my first presentation

552
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:47,679
and then as you as you start trying to

553
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:49,760
measure security

554
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:51,679
um beware of the traps

555
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:54,480
this again is meant to be an eye chart

556
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,640
these are many of the logos like like in

557
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:59,360
the industry today sorry so i can't tell

558
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:01,440
you how often i've come across security

559
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,200
teams including my own

560
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:06,480
where we start with the solution

561
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,640
we don't start with the problem

562
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,400
we start with the solution and then we

563
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,799
go search for problems to solve

564
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:15,280
it's a very easy trap to fall in right

565
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:17,600
so i always reset it's like hey no what

566
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,039
is the business problem that we're

567
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:20,960
trying to solve then we go find a

568
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,960
solution for it don't go the other way

569
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,720
around right

570
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:25,840
um

571
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:28,320
second security check boxes and an ivory

572
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:30,559
tower right security people always wired

573
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:32,720
to hey what is the security checks it

574
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:35,039
has to go be reviewed we have to approve

575
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:37,440
it then we can send it on its way but we

576
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:40,080
don't often realize that doing so slows

577
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:42,320
down the business adds friction

578
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:44,880
right and the more the more processes

579
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,559
and the more gates that we set up

580
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:48,000
there's more friction to the business

581
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,360
and we often

582
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:50,720
don't don't

583
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:53,440
weigh that heavily in our selection of

584
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:55,280
of how we're going to design something

585
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:57,200
so it's very important watch out for the

586
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,640
ivory tower

587
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:01,200
and then each logo each logo you add to

588
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,760
your security program

589
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:06,240
will add a bit of technical debt

590
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:08,400
there has to be people manning the helm

591
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,240
there has to be new processes around

592
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:12,960
this new technology there is a cost to

593
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:15,039
technology there's a cost to any logo

594
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:16,400
that you deploy

595
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,320
so i would advise you know not only the

596
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:21,120
cso but all security leaders say hey

597
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:22,880
if i'm going to

598
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,400
implement something

599
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,559
what is the cost of doing business with

600
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:28,720
that something the people cost the

601
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:31,200
process cost the man hours

602
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,600
and and the impact of the business right

603
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:34,480
so

604
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:37,039
i would say beware of the traps when you

605
00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:39,440
go and embark on hey this is what we're

606
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:42,559
gonna do in our security program right

607
00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:44,960
so let's go to the foundations right you

608
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:46,720
know these are the the key

609
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:48,400
five things that i've learned that i

610
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,159
that helped me the most

611
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:51,600
in terms of

612
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:53,600
how do we go about measuring security

613
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:55,679
right number one know your audience i

614
00:21:55,679 --> 00:21:57,440
know it's anecdotal but it's it's very

615
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:59,200
true right you just got to know your

616
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:01,360
audience the example is is the the the

617
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:03,360
board presentation that i did

618
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:06,559
number two critical super critical don't

619
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:08,559
start with metrics

620
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:10,640
it sounds it sounds counterintuitive but

621
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:13,120
do not start with metrics start with the

622
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:15,120
business objectives you may be a

623
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:17,440
hospital government agency a commercial

624
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:19,679
company an e-commerce a mobile whatever

625
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:20,640
you are

626
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,720
you have business objectives start with

627
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:23,520
that

628
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:25,600
and then say ah this is our business

629
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,200
this is how we generate revenue this is

630
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,200
what we're providing to the to the

631
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:31,520
industry what are the cyber risks to

632
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:33,120
that business whether or not you're in

633
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:35,280
the cloud you're in the data center your

634
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:37,360
user base your customer base what are

635
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:39,360
the risks of that business

636
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,480
if you start with the business

637
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:42,400
objectives and the risk around those

638
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:45,120
objectives then that will inform you

639
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:46,960
what the metrics should be not the other

640
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:48,159
way around

641
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:49,440
right

642
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:51,919
number three jeff said it you can't you

643
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:52,960
can't

644
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,400
you can't do you know you can't say

645
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,080
you're successful

646
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:57,840
if you can't measure it

647
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:59,919
right so you need to quantify what

648
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:02,720
success means in security in numbers

649
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:06,000
not anecdotes not qualitative statements

650
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,679
not not none of that you have to be able

651
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:10,960
to measure it and repeat it right

652
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:12,480
four and five are are i think

653
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:14,720
foundational as well they are they

654
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:18,400
underpin your success which is hey

655
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,400
security is it just

656
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,480
owned by the ciso is it just owned by

657
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:24,159
the security team it's a shared

658
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:26,720
responsibility right it's engineering

659
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:27,760
i.t

660
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:30,080
even teams outside of i.t like

661
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:31,919
procurement perhaps

662
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:33,440
you know needs to own some part of

663
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:36,320
security processes right so it literally

664
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:38,400
is it takes a village to secure an

665
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,720
organization not just a security team

666
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:43,919
right and in so doing that to get to get

667
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:45,440
over the hump of

668
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:48,159
he said she said and expectations set up

669
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:50,400
a racy chart who's responsible who's

670
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,640
accountable who's consulted and who's

671
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,080
informed

672
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:57,440
right it's an exercise that many

673
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,440
security engineers like me don't like

674
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:01,760
doing but it's critically important

675
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:03,760
because it sets the expectations up

676
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:05,279
front with what you and your

677
00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:07,360
stakeholders on who owns what very

678
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:08,320
important

679
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:10,320
and then finally number five is very

680
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:12,159
critical and this is something i'm very

681
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:15,840
passionate about is whoever is

682
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:17,840
is accountable meaning the buck stops

683
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:18,960
there

684
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:21,440
has to be empowered right

685
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:23,360
if you don't pair accountability with

686
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:25,279
empowerment you're setting itself for

687
00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:28,559
failure very very clearly right

688
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:31,520
okay so i apologize this is half an eye

689
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:33,600
chart but i kind of want to you know if

690
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:35,600
you look at this this slide if just

691
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,520
focus your your uh your attention to the

692
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:39,440
first row the lens

693
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:42,320
this is my attempt at kind of you know

694
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:44,840
articulating

695
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:47,919
how certain layers of the security

696
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:50,000
organization view

697
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,240
view the world right for example the

698
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:54,159
security engineers they you know their

699
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:55,520
lens is

700
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:56,880
what were the number of attacks that

701
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:58,799
made it past our firewall simple

702
00:24:58,799 --> 00:24:59,679
question

703
00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:00,480
right

704
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:02,559
managers and directors of infosec were

705
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:04,960
there were any of the attacks successful

706
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:07,120
were we able to detect and respond those

707
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:08,880
to those attacks

708
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,640
the cso will come along and say what

709
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:12,880
were the impact to the business

710
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:14,480
what have we done to prevent further

711
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:17,120
breaches what else is needed

712
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:18,720
but guess what the ceo and board will

713
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:20,640
ask do we lose money

714
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,480
did we suffer brand and reputation

715
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:25,440
damage will there be lawsuits

716
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,120
very very different questions all

717
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:29,600
equally important

718
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:30,960
right

719
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:33,360
and and so what they care about and the

720
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:35,120
metrics that that are attached to what

721
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:37,200
they care about i listed there as an

722
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:39,440
example of uh

723
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:41,919
of the differences but the the point

724
00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:44,720
here is you see that each layer of

725
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:47,440
security leadership has its lens and i

726
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:49,520
think that's the key takeaway from me i

727
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:50,960
started from the very left from the

728
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,960
security engineer i moved towards the

729
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:56,159
right where i'm a cso today right and i

730
00:25:56,159 --> 00:25:58,640
see the same patterns with my teams in

731
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,400
terms of how they lend success and

732
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:02,960
failure versus how i view success and

733
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:05,360
failures and and that's where top down

734
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:07,520
bottoms up meet and then we have to to

735
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:09,360
come towards a um

736
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:10,400
an agreement

737
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:12,640
so if you're an engineer you're trying

738
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:14,480
to influence up

739
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:16,000
right from left to right you're trying

740
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
to say hey because the number of attacks

741
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,559
detected on our firewall is so high we

742
00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:22,480
need to invest in more better technology

743
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:26,240
and firewall whereas the cso may say

744
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:27,919
how is that going to matter with our

745
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:30,960
dollars or our downtime or outage

746
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,720
there is such a gap to make that

747
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:34,320
connection right

748
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:36,720
so instead i would advise this for

749
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:39,200
security engineer especially more junior

750
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:42,000
towards more senior is the influence

751
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,600
arrow is wrong it should be this way

752
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:48,159
it should be from

753
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:50,720
right to left

754
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:51,600
right

755
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:52,559
so

756
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:54,559
the trick here is if you're a security

757
00:26:54,559 --> 00:26:56,559
engineer

758
00:26:56,559 --> 00:26:59,600
learn or or at least understand what the

759
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:01,520
cso and the board

760
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:03,360
what their questions are

761
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:04,720
and how you can

762
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:05,520
you know

763
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:07,360
feel you know fill the gap of what

764
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:09,120
you're doing versus what those questions

765
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:10,320
are because you know those questions up

766
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:11,279
front

767
00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:12,159
right

768
00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:13,919
so so influence

769
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:16,080
you know from the ceo and board down the

770
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:18,320
business down and don't try to influence

771
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:21,279
up you'll find that it's much more less

772
00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:23,120
frictional

773
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:24,720
okay

774
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:27,200
again uh if i forgot i apologize there

775
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:29,279
are times there's time for questions at

776
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:31,039
the end so if anybody in the room or

777
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:32,799
online would like to ask questions we'll

778
00:27:32,799 --> 00:27:34,399
we'll have time for that as well

779
00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:36,639
okay

780
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,080
okay

781
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:38,880
so

782
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,880
how do we do this right remember i said

783
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:43,120
we start from business objectives then

784
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:46,320
we go to a risk register so i apologize

785
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:48,000
this is for those of you in the back

786
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,240
very hard to read again the slides will

787
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:52,799
be made available but here what i did

788
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:55,200
was i plotted an example risk register

789
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:56,960
top 10 risks for the organization

790
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:58,640
plotted on the right

791
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:00,799
the right is your classic definition of

792
00:28:00,799 --> 00:28:03,600
risk impact by likelihood

793
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:05,760
so the quadrant in the upper right are

794
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:08,240
are the uh the immediate action required

795
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:09,600
the most critical things that you want

796
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:12,640
to do right so for example this in in

797
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,799
this example risk register i called out

798
00:28:14,799 --> 00:28:17,039
three top risk ransomware

799
00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:20,000
security patching or lack thereof and

800
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,240
production data in non-production

801
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:23,360
environments

802
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:24,240
right

803
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:26,399
let's say those are your t three top

804
00:28:26,399 --> 00:28:28,480
risks that you want to tackle okay

805
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:30,080
you've identified the risk register and

806
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:32,480
again the risk register has to be mapped

807
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:34,399
to the business objectives

808
00:28:34,399 --> 00:28:36,080
right whatever your business objectives

809
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:38,480
are this this research register is

810
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:40,960
mapped to this this uh fictional

811
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:42,960
business that i'm sharing with you today

812
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,480
right but let's say these are your three

813
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:45,440
risks

814
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:47,679
right

815
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:50,799
here's how i would recommend

816
00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:52,880
coming up with metrics

817
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:55,440
right we talked about it engineers

818
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:57,679
managers directors

819
00:28:57,679 --> 00:29:00,080
cso ceo and board members have different

820
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:01,200
lenses

821
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:04,480
to security right so you're plotting the

822
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:06,240
risks in the rows

823
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:09,360
and the metrics in the in the y-axis in

824
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:11,600
the columns right so these are some of

825
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:13,279
the examples i'm not going to go into

826
00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:15,039
all of these you could you can read kind

827
00:29:15,039 --> 00:29:16,960
of the examples of what a tactical

828
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:18,399
metric may be

829
00:29:18,399 --> 00:29:20,240
versus the strategic

830
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:22,240
right but the point is

831
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:24,320
you want to be able to measure it but

832
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:26,159
put a number against it don't use

833
00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:29,200
anecdotes don't use qualitative measures

834
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:31,840
right and the trick here is you wanna

835
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:33,039
you want to

836
00:29:33,039 --> 00:29:34,240
define

837
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:36,640
what your risk tolerance is the number

838
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:38,960
will never be zero or a hundred but

839
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:41,120
maybe that's not what the business needs

840
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:42,720
maybe what the business needs to be is

841
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:45,360
between 90 and and 80

842
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:47,760
for example right

843
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:51,440
so so if if you take this lens into how

844
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:54,080
you measure security and understand that

845
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:54,880
hey

846
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:56,960
if my audience or the engineers managers

847
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:58,720
and directors i would go with the

848
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:01,600
tactical metrics and if my audience

849
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:04,240
are the csos the ceos and the boards i

850
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:06,399
would go with strategic metrics i think

851
00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:08,480
you get a lot more traction

852
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:09,520
right

853
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:10,559
right

854
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:13,520
um again i think you know two takeaways

855
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:14,880
here is

856
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:16,480
always make sure you you're able to

857
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:17,840
quantify

858
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:20,080
what the metric is whether or not it's

859
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:22,320
tactical or strategic it's some some of

860
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:23,679
these are very hard to measure for

861
00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:26,000
example how do you attach a dollar loss

862
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,799
to an incident very hard right cost of

863
00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:30,880
forensics cost of investigations costs

864
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:34,000
of man hours from hr from pr from

865
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,640
infosec and so on and so forth but you

866
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:38,399
but but you still should

867
00:30:38,399 --> 00:30:40,240
attempt to measure it because if you

868
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:41,919
don't measure it you don't know how

869
00:30:41,919 --> 00:30:43,679
you're doing against it at all

870
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:44,559
right

871
00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:47,520
and and i think the trick here also is

872
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:50,480
to plot the risks against the time

873
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:52,080
right how are you doing this quarter

874
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:53,760
versus next quarter how did you do last

875
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:56,399
quarter is this improving

876
00:30:56,399 --> 00:30:58,960
when you bring this into the boardroom

877
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:01,760
the ceo or even the cfo

878
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:03,760
you're you're bringing hey here's where

879
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:06,000
we were it's either gotten better or

880
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,320
it's gotten worse you're able to tell a

881
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:10,399
story there's a narrative you're not

882
00:31:10,399 --> 00:31:11,760
lost in the woods anymore it's like

883
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:13,039
you're just sharing one data point

884
00:31:13,039 --> 00:31:15,679
without any context which is very hard

885
00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:18,640
right so so don't underestimate

886
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:21,519
the power of plotting these metrics

887
00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:24,480
against time and telling that story

888
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:26,320
whether or not it's a good story or it's

889
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:28,080
a bad story you're just showing facts

890
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:30,240
and data right

891
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:32,480
okay

892
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:36,880
so so now what did we solve the problem

893
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:39,120
right

894
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:41,679
i would submit to you that if we have a

895
00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:43,279
risk register

896
00:31:43,279 --> 00:31:45,360
that's our north star

897
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:48,000
and we were able to

898
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,640
define what the metrics that are

899
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:52,640
attributable to each of those risks

900
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:54,480
tactical or strategic based on our

901
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:55,440
audience

902
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:57,679
where we're now able to remove wasteful

903
00:31:57,679 --> 00:31:59,840
spin right because once you have your

904
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:02,480
metrics defined your security roadmap

905
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:04,960
should be aligned to those metrics all

906
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:06,880
the projects all of the investments all

907
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:08,480
the logos that you're going to go by and

908
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:11,200
set up processes are in service to

909
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:13,279
meeting those metrics so you're able to

910
00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:14,960
remove waste

911
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:16,320
right

912
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:18,159
increase mistrust with security you

913
00:32:18,159 --> 00:32:20,399
break you've broken down the ivory tower

914
00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:22,320
the risk register is public information

915
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:24,320
the metrics are public information in

916
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:25,840
fact they're not only public they're

917
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:28,000
shared to the board and the management

918
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,080
so every single team in the company

919
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:32,799
knows what your goals are

920
00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:34,880
and it's been signed off

921
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:36,640
it's been presented to the board this

922
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:38,399
isn't something security is cooking in

923
00:32:38,399 --> 00:32:40,880
the kitchen in a silo this is what the

924
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:42,640
company needs to do

925
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:45,760
right so so so what that will do is it

926
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:46,559
will

927
00:32:46,559 --> 00:32:49,519
notify other teams that hey this isn't a

928
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:51,360
security thing it's a company thing so

929
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:53,200
that breaks down to ivory tower all

930
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:54,320
right

931
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:56,559
again helps drive budgets and hiring

932
00:32:56,559 --> 00:32:58,320
budgets and hiring are super critical

933
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:00,559
for security a lot of times you know i

934
00:33:00,559 --> 00:33:02,399
know that i'm a cso and i'm always like

935
00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:04,960
hey i need more heads i need more budget

936
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:07,360
i need more resources but the the

937
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:09,279
question from the cfo always comes back

938
00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:11,919
as show me where the need is how do you

939
00:33:11,919 --> 00:33:13,679
quantify the need what is really the

940
00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:16,720
need and i struggle if i come with an

941
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:19,519
answer that's anecdotal or qualitative

942
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:22,559
if i show the risk register our metrics

943
00:33:22,559 --> 00:33:24,320
and how we're doing against our metrics

944
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:25,919
either i don't need the budget but

945
00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:27,919
because we're doing great or we're doing

946
00:33:27,919 --> 00:33:29,760
so horrible say yeah this is this is

947
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:31,360
blinking red we need to throw money at

948
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:32,559
this

949
00:33:32,559 --> 00:33:35,440
right so so again it really helps drive

950
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:37,440
your budgets and priorities

951
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:39,279
and over and if you get the first three

952
00:33:39,279 --> 00:33:41,039
bullets right guess what your

953
00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:43,760
organization's cyber risk has decreased

954
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:46,399
now you're you're actually

955
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:48,480
achieving your objective in your role

956
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:51,519
wherever that role may be right

957
00:33:51,519 --> 00:33:53,360
um the challenges do we address the

958
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:54,559
challenges

959
00:33:54,559 --> 00:33:56,559
right security is a game of risk

960
00:33:56,559 --> 00:33:58,960
management well the time that we took to

961
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:01,600
define the risk register and translate

962
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:04,240
the register to metrics

963
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:07,200
demystified the the subjectiveness of

964
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:07,919
this

965
00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:09,839
it's clear it's quantified you can

966
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:11,199
measure it

967
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:12,800
right

968
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,560
we have prioritization in the risk

969
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:16,480
register what is the top three top five

970
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:17,839
top ten things that we're going to go

971
00:34:17,839 --> 00:34:20,800
fix this year right

972
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:23,040
um

973
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:25,119
and then you know finally i would say

974
00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:27,679
this the you know the last bullet of

975
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:30,000
many ways to measure security i i can't

976
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:33,040
emphasize enough in my own experiences

977
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:35,599
in learning with the board

978
00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:39,040
with running teams with building teams

979
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:40,000
with

980
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,079
you know

981
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:43,599
know your audience

982
00:34:43,599 --> 00:34:45,440
when you walk into room and you're

983
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:49,119
presenting to the cfo or a vendor or a

984
00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:51,119
partner you just got to know your

985
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:54,399
audience and speak to them in in terms

986
00:34:54,399 --> 00:34:56,800
and metrics that they would understand

987
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:58,480
that that's the biggest

988
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:00,240
that's the biggest learning i've had in

989
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:02,880
my career in terms of

990
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:04,400
demystifying things and removing

991
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:06,640
friction because people you know even if

992
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:08,000
they don't understand something they

993
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,520
would normally nod and understand and

994
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:10,880
you walk out of the room thinking hey i

995
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:12,960
got my point across everybody gets it

996
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:14,480
not so the case

997
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:18,480
right so i think it really helps us

998
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:21,520
as security professionals to recognize

999
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:23,440
audiences are different

1000
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:25,760
they have different lenses

1001
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:28,160
different metrics are meaningful to

1002
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:29,599
different people

1003
00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:31,839
at different layers of security but also

1004
00:35:31,839 --> 00:35:33,839
different layers of management

1005
00:35:33,839 --> 00:35:38,000
right so we we have to recognize and and

1006
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,480
communicate in that framework

1007
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:42,720
okay

1008
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:46,000
so recapping i think i repeated myself

1009
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,400
but but i i will close out by saying you

1010
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:50,240
know number four and five

1011
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:52,079
right

1012
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:53,839
for all this to work

1013
00:35:53,839 --> 00:35:56,079
you really need a racy you really need

1014
00:35:56,079 --> 00:35:57,760
to define who's accountable at the end

1015
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:58,880
of the day

1016
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:00,400
for example

1017
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:02,079
patching

1018
00:36:02,079 --> 00:36:04,320
is the cso responsible for that

1019
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:06,480
is the cio responsible for that for the

1020
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:08,240
i.t systems

1021
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:11,040
is the cto responsible for that for the

1022
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:12,560
engineering systems

1023
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:14,800
who is accountable for that risk to the

1024
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:17,920
organization and the day without a racy

1025
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:20,640
i may think as a cso the cio owns that's

1026
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:22,880
not my problem but the cio said no

1027
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:24,880
you're the security leader you own

1028
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:27,680
patching if we don't talk or put this

1029
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:29,920
down we we have

1030
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:32,320
misaligned expectations

1031
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:34,880
right so racy is very critical if all

1032
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:36,160
this is going to work you got to have a

1033
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:37,680
racy right

1034
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:39,440
and then with the racy once you know

1035
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:41,440
who's accountable they have to be

1036
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:42,800
empowered

1037
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,880
right empower means do i have the

1038
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:47,359
authority to achieve my objective of

1039
00:36:47,359 --> 00:36:48,880
patching for example do i have the

1040
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:51,040
budget do i have the process do i have

1041
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:52,079
the people

1042
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:53,839
to to to achieve

1043
00:36:53,839 --> 00:36:56,079
right so you gotta pair accountability

1044
00:36:56,079 --> 00:36:57,760
with empowerment

1045
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:58,880
um

1046
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:01,119
so finally i would say you know uh

1047
00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:03,040
sharing a quote from albert einstein a

1048
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:04,720
person who never made a mistake never

1049
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:06,480
tried anything new this is something

1050
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:08,079
that i i

1051
00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:09,119
i

1052
00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:11,280
i'm passionate about because you know

1053
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:13,680
security people we're risk averse by

1054
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:15,599
nature we don't like mistakes we don't

1055
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:16,880
like you know because one of our

1056
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:18,240
mistakes can be

1057
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:20,320
a huge incident right

1058
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:23,200
but i'm more of hey we got to try new

1059
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:25,680
things we got to be bold

1060
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:27,920
right especially around things like this

1061
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:30,400
where maybe it's not comfortable maybe

1062
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:31,680
you're you know you have cultural

1063
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:34,160
challenges within your organization

1064
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:36,800
um some organization can turn on a dime

1065
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:39,200
they can go through this model quickly

1066
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:41,599
others will take a year or more because

1067
00:37:41,599 --> 00:37:44,320
of bureaucracy politics processes

1068
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:45,359
whatever

1069
00:37:45,359 --> 00:37:47,920
but i would say don't let that detract

1070
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:50,960
you from pushing towards this model

1071
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:53,119
i you know throughout my career i've

1072
00:37:53,119 --> 00:37:54,720
talked to a lot of other csos in my

1073
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:56,560
network and

1074
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:58,640
the common theme that i always see

1075
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:00,640
always without exception is all of us

1076
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:02,000
are dealing

1077
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,400
with some level of challenges in in this

1078
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:06,880
in this paradigm meaning

1079
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:07,680
the

1080
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:10,560
measuring of security how do we

1081
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:12,640
communicate to our board our leadership

1082
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:14,880
our owners are our shareholders that

1083
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:16,480
we're moving the needle with security

1084
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:18,480
it's always some layer of that

1085
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:20,240
right and so

1086
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:21,680
this is what i've learned throughout my

1087
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:24,640
career i hope it has helped you give you

1088
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:27,119
some thoughts and ideas and how you can

1089
00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:28,720
measure more measure security more

1090
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:31,280
effectively in your organizations

1091
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:33,040
and at this point i would be happy to

1092
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:36,320
take any questions

1093
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:40,800
any questions online uh

1094
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:42,720
let me know otherwise in the room if you

1095
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:45,440
have any please

1096
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:47,680
thank you george there are no questions

1097
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:50,640
from our virtual audience

1098
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:52,879
okay

1099
00:38:53,119 --> 00:38:56,320
uh hi we have a question here yeah uh hi

1100
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:58,079
i'm simon showered i'm a reporter for

1101
00:38:58,079 --> 00:39:01,280
the register i'm just wondering

1102
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:03,920
um really great stuff there

1103
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:05,680
which of the tactics that you've

1104
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:07,839
discussed today have you found most

1105
00:39:07,839 --> 00:39:08,800
useful

1106
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,400
in your new role

1107
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:12,079
and in response to what sort of

1108
00:39:12,079 --> 00:39:13,920
challenges because i mean it's a fast

1109
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:15,440
growing organization you've got the

1110
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:16,800
merger happening

1111
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:18,800
uh there's a lot going on you've got

1112
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:21,040
expansion happening

1113
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:23,680
uh are you talking about my particular

1114
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:25,359
organization today

1115
00:39:25,359 --> 00:39:29,200
okay so so

1116
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:31,359
i would say this way we we we have our

1117
00:39:31,359 --> 00:39:32,880
chair of challenges like any other

1118
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:35,599
grenades organization right we have

1119
00:39:35,599 --> 00:39:37,119
multiple

1120
00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:39,040
teams that we're trying to bring

1121
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:42,079
together right and and there's always

1122
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:44,000
going to be challenges around that so i

1123
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,079
would say this way our approach is

1124
00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:49,119
pragmatic what we do is we identify

1125
00:39:49,119 --> 00:39:52,400
the areas of commonality uh for example

1126
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:55,359
uh infosec right infosec for gojek gtf

1127
00:39:55,359 --> 00:39:56,800
and tokopedia i'm assuming you're asking

1128
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:58,800
about my organization right

1129
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:01,520
each of us are our risk registers may be

1130
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:03,599
different which means our north stars

1131
00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:05,760
are different right but some of those

1132
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:08,640
risks may be the same or very similar

1133
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:10,400
well if they're similar the next

1134
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:13,200
question becomes can we use our existing

1135
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:15,359
technology and process

1136
00:40:15,359 --> 00:40:17,200
to manage that risk to mitigate that

1137
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:20,319
risk and some of some of it does right

1138
00:40:20,319 --> 00:40:22,400
and so that's low hanging fruit so we

1139
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:24,400
actually do the analysis and circle the

1140
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:26,800
ones that we can consolidate

1141
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:28,240
and those are the ones that we will

1142
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:30,400
consolidate and work together on for the

1143
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:31,680
other ones

1144
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:32,800
maybe

1145
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:34,880
we can in a quarter or two quarters or

1146
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:36,960
and then and then the last bucket is the

1147
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:38,880
stuff we can so

1148
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:40,400
bottom line at the end of the day it's

1149
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:42,800
really just an iterative process

1150
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:44,640
the approach i think you're asking about

1151
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:46,720
the approach the approach is exactly

1152
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:49,040
that is identify

1153
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:51,280
where there's commonality on your north

1154
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:53,520
star which is your risk register

1155
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:55,440
because patching is almost ubiquitous

1156
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:57,119
everybody deals with patching right and

1157
00:40:57,119 --> 00:40:59,200
maybe that's an example where the

1158
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:01,359
technology that you use and the process

1159
00:41:01,359 --> 00:41:03,280
that you use can be merged together

1160
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:05,200
including the teams

1161
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:06,720
right it doesn't make sense to have two

1162
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:08,000
different teams doing two different

1163
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,480
silos maybe it's one team patching at

1164
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:12,079
all and now you can move staff around

1165
00:41:12,079 --> 00:41:13,440
and give them stretch assignments and

1166
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:15,280
things like that

1167
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:17,440
i'll be honest it's it's a challenge but

1168
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:19,119
it's something that we are currently

1169
00:41:19,119 --> 00:41:21,680
working on in progress very uh

1170
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:24,000
very passionately about okay so have you

1171
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,400
started merging those teams i'm sorry

1172
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:28,160
have you started merging teams across

1173
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:30,400
the the different units slowly

1174
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:32,480
yes

1175
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:35,280
slowly but surely thank you

1176
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:36,240
sure

1177
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:38,319
we have another question

1178
00:41:38,319 --> 00:41:40,480
george thanks for the presentation i get

1179
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:42,400
what you're saying about start with the

1180
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:44,079
business objectives before defining the

1181
00:41:44,079 --> 00:41:45,440
metrics

1182
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:47,599
it's kind of a tactical thing but do you

1183
00:41:47,599 --> 00:41:50,240
have any advice around sort of the quick

1184
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:53,040
wins or low-hanging fruit in terms of

1185
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:55,200
metrics things like i don't know number

1186
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:57,680
of vulnerabilities or mean time to fix

1187
00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:00,240
there must be a common set of

1188
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:01,920
metrics that you know regardless of the

1189
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:04,720
business objectives that you would use

1190
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:07,040
great question thanks lawrence um

1191
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:08,480
you know when you asked that question

1192
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:10,240
probably the the the first thing that

1193
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:11,839
popped into my mind

1194
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:13,119
is

1195
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:15,119
by show of hands how many of your

1196
00:42:15,119 --> 00:42:17,839
organizations uh deal you know have

1197
00:42:17,839 --> 00:42:19,359
challenges with phishing and social

1198
00:42:19,359 --> 00:42:21,839
engineering

1199
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,240
virtually everybody in the room right

1200
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:26,560
so one of the things we do is we fish

1201
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:28,800
our users every month

1202
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:31,200
every month we offer starbucks gift

1203
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:34,000
cards we offer iphones we offer coupons

1204
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,640
we offer free rides whatever right and

1205
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:38,079
we measure

1206
00:42:38,079 --> 00:42:40,880
the amount of times the user falls

1207
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:43,040
victim to by clicking on the link

1208
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:46,079
and more more insidious is if they give

1209
00:42:46,079 --> 00:42:48,480
up their username and password

1210
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:50,800
and so that's something that's not hard

1211
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:51,839
to do

1212
00:42:51,839 --> 00:42:54,079
investment wise or process wise

1213
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:56,400
but if you're able to to measure that

1214
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:58,560
and do security awareness training

1215
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:00,800
onboarding training or

1216
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:02,319
i don't know set up a wall of shame

1217
00:43:02,319 --> 00:43:03,920
where you put the numbers you know the

1218
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:05,920
names of victims on a wall and and that

1219
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:08,720
drives down your fishing susceptibility

1220
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:11,040
percentage that to me is an example of a

1221
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:13,119
low-hanging fruit that's somebody that's

1222
00:43:13,119 --> 00:43:14,640
something that everybody can do it's not

1223
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:15,920
a technical solution you don't have to

1224
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:17,359
code you have to go buy a million dollar

1225
00:43:17,359 --> 00:43:19,440
tool to do that but that applies to

1226
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:21,520
almost everybody in the room right

1227
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:23,359
whether or not your hospital a bank a

1228
00:43:23,359 --> 00:43:24,800
government agency

1229
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:26,240
right so that would be a low-hanging

1230
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:27,119
fruit

1231
00:43:27,119 --> 00:43:28,160
right

1232
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:30,400
yeah

1233
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:31,760
any other questions

1234
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:32,650
we have a question here

1235
00:43:32,650 --> 00:43:34,160
[Music]

1236
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:35,920
hey george great presentation really

1237
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:37,920
good stuff hey a little bit of different

1238
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:39,599
angle from the last question what's the

1239
00:43:39,599 --> 00:43:41,119
high hanging fruit in your experience

1240
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:42,880
what's the hardest stuff you've

1241
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:45,200
encountered to quantify to to measure to

1242
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:48,319
drive oh great great question so so i

1243
00:43:48,319 --> 00:43:50,640
would say i have a different uh bias

1244
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:52,560
i'll be honest my my opinion of this is

1245
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:53,440
bias

1246
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:56,720
i i don't believe the the in my mind the

1247
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:59,760
challenge isn't so much the the

1248
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:01,359
the security

1249
00:44:01,359 --> 00:44:06,079
problem per se it's more about ownership

1250
00:44:06,079 --> 00:44:08,800
ownership for example lawrence works for

1251
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:09,760
sneak

1252
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:13,040
right and sneak helps the engineering

1253
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:15,119
team remove vulnerabilities throughout

1254
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:16,880
their software development life cycle as

1255
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:18,640
they code making sure that open source

1256
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:20,160
libraries are free of vulnerabilities

1257
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:22,960
and so on and so forth right

1258
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:25,680
who owns that if there is a

1259
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:28,480
vulnerability in your product who owns

1260
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:29,760
that at the end of the day is it the

1261
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:32,319
ciso is it the cto is it the engineering

1262
00:44:32,319 --> 00:44:34,160
team is it the infosec team that pen

1263
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:35,760
tests that app

1264
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:36,960
who is it

1265
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:39,440
so so my point there is there are

1266
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:41,680
solutions and technologies and you can

1267
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:44,079
stitch processes to those things but

1268
00:44:44,079 --> 00:44:47,440
this deciding who owns it codifying the

1269
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:49,359
ownership of it and then putting that

1270
00:44:49,359 --> 00:44:51,599
into practice is a lot harder right so

1271
00:44:51,599 --> 00:44:54,319
that's my first answer to you kind of so

1272
00:44:54,319 --> 00:44:56,880
so before the problem uh fixed the

1273
00:44:56,880 --> 00:44:58,240
ownership problem first before the

1274
00:44:58,240 --> 00:44:59,599
technical problem

1275
00:44:59,599 --> 00:45:01,200
my first answer

1276
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:02,560
um

1277
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:05,119
technical problem wise i i would say

1278
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:07,280
this probably

1279
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:09,599
you know i would answer with a theme

1280
00:45:09,599 --> 00:45:11,760
is insiders

1281
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:14,400
right insider threats meaning all of us

1282
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:16,480
have users in our organization

1283
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:18,560
they already have access to our systems

1284
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:21,440
what happens if they turn rogue

1285
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:22,319
what

1286
00:45:22,319 --> 00:45:24,640
process or systems do you have in place

1287
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:26,400
to detect prevent

1288
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:28,640
or prevent or even detect that

1289
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:30,720
very very hard problem to solve there

1290
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:33,040
are technologies you can use uba sorry

1291
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:35,119
acronym right user user behavior

1292
00:45:35,119 --> 00:45:38,240
analysis and all these whiz-bang ml and

1293
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:40,560
ai but at the end of the day it's a very

1294
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:42,160
hard problem to solve a technical

1295
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:44,319
challenge right is how do you

1296
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:47,359
manage the the insider threat uh cyber

1297
00:45:47,359 --> 00:45:48,640
attack vector

1298
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:51,119
uh hope that helps

1299
00:45:51,119 --> 00:45:52,880
we have another question

1300
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:55,520
yeah uh my name is chad um

1301
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:59,200
so i get that it's extremely useful for

1302
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:02,480
ceos to see metrics that allows them to

1303
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:05,200
compare different priorities

1304
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:07,440
and in some contexts

1305
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:08,880
the number of attacks that make it

1306
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:10,880
through the firewall i guess

1307
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:12,480
was your example

1308
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:14,240
you could maybe come up with some

1309
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:15,280
metrics

1310
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:18,480
but like when i think about my uh

1311
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:20,240
like the things that i would like uh

1312
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:22,079
management to invest in

1313
00:46:22,079 --> 00:46:23,040
um

1314
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:25,200
i really don't see how i'm going to come

1315
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:26,800
up with a metric for

1316
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:29,359
like okay there's this particular thing

1317
00:46:29,359 --> 00:46:30,960
that an insider could do and it would

1318
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:32,960
cause this problems

1319
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:35,280
nobody has ever done that before but i

1320
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:37,440
still think it needs to be addressed

1321
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:39,760
and besides coming up with a number of

1322
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:42,079
like there are 100 insiders that could

1323
00:46:42,079 --> 00:46:43,200
do this

1324
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:44,400
uh

1325
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:46,160
it seems

1326
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:48,000
you know any number that i would ascribe

1327
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:49,440
to it is is

1328
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:51,440
just going to be kind of made up and and

1329
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:53,960
not really worth using as a

1330
00:46:53,960 --> 00:46:56,960
decision-making tool so

1331
00:46:56,960 --> 00:46:58,400
how does one

1332
00:46:58,400 --> 00:46:59,280
uh

1333
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:00,560
communicate

1334
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:01,839
um

1335
00:47:01,839 --> 00:47:05,119
like a binary question of the are our

1336
00:47:05,119 --> 00:47:07,200
infrastructure is vulnerable to this or

1337
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:10,160
not yep great question great question i

1338
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:12,560
think your question is is

1339
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:14,560
that challenge is shared across all of

1340
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:15,839
us here in the room

1341
00:47:15,839 --> 00:47:18,079
right and and the tool that i think

1342
00:47:18,079 --> 00:47:20,319
helps with answering that is your risk

1343
00:47:20,319 --> 00:47:21,359
register

1344
00:47:21,359 --> 00:47:23,280
because when you show the ceo and the

1345
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:25,040
board the risk register

1346
00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:27,359
they either agree with you

1347
00:47:27,359 --> 00:47:29,359
or don't agree with you

1348
00:47:29,359 --> 00:47:31,119
if they agree with you

1349
00:47:31,119 --> 00:47:32,400
then

1350
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:34,160
we need to do something about everything

1351
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:36,559
in the top right quadrant

1352
00:47:36,559 --> 00:47:39,040
right so in your discussion with your

1353
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:41,839
ceo or leadership if you're plotting a

1354
00:47:41,839 --> 00:47:44,480
risk that's in the upper right

1355
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:46,880
that means by definition it's a high

1356
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:48,640
likelihood meaning the risk is high this

1357
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:50,400
bad thing is going to happen and the

1358
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:51,839
impact is high which means it's going to

1359
00:47:51,839 --> 00:47:53,839
cost us a ton of money

1360
00:47:53,839 --> 00:47:55,839
what are we doing about it how are we

1361
00:47:55,839 --> 00:47:57,680
measuring against that risk

1362
00:47:57,680 --> 00:48:00,400
right so i would say start by plotting

1363
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:01,599
this

1364
00:48:01,599 --> 00:48:03,920
right and getting consistent consensus

1365
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:06,559
within your organization cso cio cto

1366
00:48:06,559 --> 00:48:09,440
whoever that that can help you

1367
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:11,839
that help that understands the risk but

1368
00:48:11,839 --> 00:48:13,520
also can

1369
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:15,359
ally with you

1370
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:17,520
show this to the ceo and the board and

1371
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:19,280
if the business leaders agree this is a

1372
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:21,119
risk then that's how you drive for

1373
00:48:21,119 --> 00:48:23,200
investments

1374
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:25,599
does that help

1375
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:28,079
hi george we have a question from our

1376
00:48:28,079 --> 00:48:31,040
virtual audience xiang jin

1377
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:33,760
the question goes how can a society

1378
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:36,240
engineer be trained to present

1379
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:38,400
effectively to a ceo

1380
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:41,599
a junior society engineer would probably

1381
00:48:41,599 --> 00:48:44,559
not have enough experience to shift

1382
00:48:44,559 --> 00:48:48,000
their thinking this quickly

1383
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,079
that's not an easy answer i don't have a

1384
00:48:50,079 --> 00:48:52,400
silver bullet for that i think you know

1385
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:54,880
what i would do uh if just a good

1386
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:56,720
question for me mental mental uh

1387
00:48:56,720 --> 00:48:58,640
question is if i had to do it all over

1388
00:48:58,640 --> 00:49:00,800
again what would help me move faster to

1389
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:03,440
get to to you know to resonance how do i

1390
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:04,480
resonate

1391
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:08,319
i would say you got to iterate meaning

1392
00:49:08,319 --> 00:49:10,319
however uncomfortable you are as a

1393
00:49:10,319 --> 00:49:11,760
security engineer even if you're

1394
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:14,319
starting out you got to attempt to to

1395
00:49:14,319 --> 00:49:16,480
learn this side of the fence not just

1396
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:18,400
bits and bytes and firewalls and source

1397
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:20,480
code all day long you got to understand

1398
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:23,040
how do i fill that gap between what i

1399
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:24,960
care about what i'm passionate about

1400
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:27,680
versus what the ceo cares about

1401
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:30,079
start learning about that and and it's

1402
00:49:30,079 --> 00:49:31,760
not there's not one book that i would

1403
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:33,359
say you can go read and magically this

1404
00:49:33,359 --> 00:49:36,480
will happen it's iteratively just trying

1405
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:37,680
these things out and you're going to

1406
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:39,200
have meetings like me with my board

1407
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:40,000
where

1408
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:41,760
it didn't go well

1409
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:42,640
but

1410
00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:44,400
every failure is a success

1411
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:46,640
right so you just got to iteratively

1412
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:49,200
learn and and go but what i would say is

1413
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:51,599
don't be fearful you you got to do

1414
00:49:51,599 --> 00:49:52,720
because

1415
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:54,960
one of the things i also learned is it's

1416
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:55,920
better

1417
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:58,960
to to be the voice of contrarian versus

1418
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:01,040
just being quiet about it even if you

1419
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:02,720
know something's bad the co is not going

1420
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:04,960
to you know come down hard on you

1421
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:06,640
actually they are going to appreciate

1422
00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:08,640
you by calling out something that you

1423
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:10,720
think is truthful because you you back

1424
00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:13,599
it up with what you believe in right so

1425
00:50:13,599 --> 00:50:15,599
no secret answer no secret you know

1426
00:50:15,599 --> 00:50:17,359
silver bullet to the answer

1427
00:50:17,359 --> 00:50:19,520
on this one but don't let that detract

1428
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:22,400
you from pushing do it iteratively learn

1429
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:23,839
as much as you can and try to fill that

1430
00:50:23,839 --> 00:50:26,800
gap and the best the best tool is to

1431
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:28,800
actually put yourself in the hot seat

1432
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:31,680
and present to the ceo there's no better

1433
00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:33,359
way to learn by jumping in the deep end

1434
00:50:33,359 --> 00:50:35,839
of the pool

1435
00:50:36,319 --> 00:50:37,520
question here

1436
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:39,280
hi uh great presentation so far by the

1437
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:42,000
way i just want to ask any tips on

1438
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,160
changing security culture within an

1439
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:45,920
organization and whether that's

1440
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:47,599
at the board level at some point you

1441
00:50:47,599 --> 00:50:49,119
mentioned places like north america

1442
00:50:49,119 --> 00:50:51,200
perhaps that transition has already

1443
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:52,640
happened maybe even regulators are

1444
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:54,079
pushing it in some industries that's not

1445
00:50:54,079 --> 00:50:56,319
the case all over the world though so

1446
00:50:56,319 --> 00:50:58,079
even from the board level like down

1447
00:50:58,079 --> 00:50:59,359
through the management and then down to

1448
00:50:59,359 --> 00:51:01,440
the individual i.t and engineering teams

1449
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:03,119
who are maybe uh i know you sort of

1450
00:51:03,119 --> 00:51:04,960
mentioned creating your racy chart but

1451
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:06,640
you might say hey you're accountable for

1452
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:08,319
this right now and they're like no

1453
00:51:08,319 --> 00:51:09,760
that's your problem mate i don't want

1454
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:11,119
anything to do with it so any kind of

1455
00:51:11,119 --> 00:51:13,680
tips i guess from your experience i do i

1456
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:14,480
do

1457
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:17,040
um you know i think all of us have one

1458
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:18,880
time in our lives have tried security

1459
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:21,599
champions and mixed success and all that

1460
00:51:21,599 --> 00:51:24,000
i i i'm an advocate of that but i would

1461
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,400
say where i've seen the biggest needle

1462
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:28,079
movement to that

1463
00:51:28,079 --> 00:51:31,359
is you do a war game exercise but you do

1464
00:51:31,359 --> 00:51:33,280
it at the board level

1465
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:34,880
you're saying ah

1466
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:36,640
board level board in the next board

1467
00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:38,400
meeting ask your general counsel or

1468
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:39,839
whoever the secretary is hey i would

1469
00:51:39,839 --> 00:51:42,000
like to do a war game exercise with our

1470
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,800
board members i like to simulate a data

1471
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:46,960
breach a ransomware attack something

1472
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:48,480
right and

1473
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:50,319
let that roll you either do it yourself

1474
00:51:50,319 --> 00:51:52,559
or you hire a third party to come in

1475
00:51:52,559 --> 00:51:54,640
and you'll find that as they go through

1476
00:51:54,640 --> 00:51:57,040
the exercise light bulbs start picking

1477
00:51:57,040 --> 00:51:58,240
up oh my god

1478
00:51:58,240 --> 00:52:00,000
who's going to talk to the media who's

1479
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,079
going to wake up the ceo who's going to

1480
00:52:02,079 --> 00:52:04,400
tell the the market that we're down for

1481
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:05,680
three days

1482
00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:08,640
right the these these these super

1483
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:11,520
important questions come out and that is

1484
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:12,640
the biggest

1485
00:52:12,640 --> 00:52:15,839
instant instant you know uh you know

1486
00:52:15,839 --> 00:52:18,800
recognition of the the the gravity of

1487
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:21,359
the problem of the risks so i would say

1488
00:52:21,359 --> 00:52:23,200
you know you can't just tomorrow go hey

1489
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:24,319
i'm going to do a cyber security

1490
00:52:24,319 --> 00:52:25,920
exercise with my board you want to build

1491
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:28,319
up to it right but but i think in my

1492
00:52:28,319 --> 00:52:31,040
career i've seen where that exercise you

1493
00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:33,200
know moves the needle the most and i

1494
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:35,040
would say you know

1495
00:52:35,040 --> 00:52:36,880
after we did that exercise in my

1496
00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:40,480
previous previous organization i had

1497
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:42,960
100 of my board members come up to me to

1498
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:44,240
say george

1499
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:46,079
this is so hype opening i've learned so

1500
00:52:46,079 --> 00:52:47,680
much how can i help you

1501
00:52:47,680 --> 00:52:50,078
100

1502
00:52:50,640 --> 00:52:52,079
yeah

1503
00:52:52,079 --> 00:52:54,160
we have another question from our

1504
00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:57,280
virtual audience nd would you please

1505
00:52:57,280 --> 00:53:01,839
share your top three effective metrics

1506
00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:04,480
that's a hard one

1507
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:06,240
remember i have to know my audience

1508
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:08,559
first my top three metrics for the board

1509
00:53:08,559 --> 00:53:10,480
versus my top three metrics for myself

1510
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:12,880
or or my my staff different

1511
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:15,359
different so um

1512
00:53:15,359 --> 00:53:16,480
i'm going to cheat a little bit and say

1513
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:19,119
this way please refer to my slides on on

1514
00:53:19,119 --> 00:53:22,000
what so in my slides when i drew out the

1515
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:25,280
examples of the metrics

1516
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:27,119
right

1517
00:53:27,119 --> 00:53:28,800
these are the ones that are top of mind

1518
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:30,400
for me so you can say these are my

1519
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:33,440
prioritized ones for as an example for

1520
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:36,160
each of these layers

1521
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:37,440
cool

1522
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:39,200
hey george i'm running here i have a

1523
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:40,400
question for you

1524
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:42,079
a bit more practical i want to

1525
00:53:42,079 --> 00:53:43,680
understand from your experience have you

1526
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:46,240
ever faced a situation where there's a

1527
00:53:46,240 --> 00:53:48,400
distrust with the board

1528
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:49,520
um

1529
00:53:49,520 --> 00:53:51,359
either it's from your predecessor or you

1530
00:53:51,359 --> 00:53:53,280
know um whatever that happened in the

1531
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:55,040
organization as you are taking on this

1532
00:53:55,040 --> 00:53:58,000
role um how do you then bounce back and

1533
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,079
regain control build the trust back with

1534
00:54:00,079 --> 00:54:02,400
the board um

1535
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:04,720
you're saying andre the the trust from

1536
00:54:04,720 --> 00:54:06,559
you to the board of the board on on you

1537
00:54:06,559 --> 00:54:09,040
as a ciso security as a whole got it got

1538
00:54:09,040 --> 00:54:11,280
it got it

1539
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:13,040
so

1540
00:54:13,040 --> 00:54:14,800
i actually haven't had an experience

1541
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:16,079
like that so i can't speak to it

1542
00:54:16,079 --> 00:54:18,720
firsthand uh but but i can kind of tell

1543
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:20,640
you what i would do in that situation

1544
00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:21,440
right

1545
00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:24,880
if you're if you're succeeding a

1546
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:27,280
previous leader that has

1547
00:54:27,280 --> 00:54:29,520
no trust from the board

1548
00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:32,160
i think the first thing i would do is

1549
00:54:32,160 --> 00:54:34,800
kind of my example is i would

1550
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:37,040
pull one or two board members aside

1551
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:38,960
individually and have a heart to heart

1552
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:40,720
it's like please top of your mind please

1553
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:42,880
just be honest what is the problem

1554
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:45,680
what is it is it a communications is it

1555
00:54:45,680 --> 00:54:47,760
you know loss in the woods is it we got

1556
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:49,280
hacked so many times we can't remember

1557
00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:51,200
anything anymore like understand truly

1558
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:53,599
what the problem is and based on that

1559
00:54:53,599 --> 00:54:55,839
those conversations

1560
00:54:55,839 --> 00:54:58,480
build my risk register build my metrics

1561
00:54:58,480 --> 00:55:01,040
backwards right i i wouldn't do that in

1562
00:55:01,040 --> 00:55:02,880
a big forum because people won't be

1563
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:04,960
honest or share everything with you but

1564
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:07,680
but in that example i would literally

1565
00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:09,760
say hey please can we go have coffee and

1566
00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:11,839
i just want to you know be a sounding

1567
00:55:11,839 --> 00:55:13,280
board for you on what you think the

1568
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:15,280
biggest issues are with security the

1569
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:18,240
board members as well as the ceo uh and

1570
00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:20,799
then i won't stop there i'll go down to

1571
00:55:20,799 --> 00:55:23,520
my stakeholders the cio the cto so then

1572
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:25,280
you start building a picture

1573
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:27,839
each each each area of the business will

1574
00:55:27,839 --> 00:55:30,319
will have a lens on what the problem is

1575
00:55:30,319 --> 00:55:32,240
some of them may be the same some of

1576
00:55:32,240 --> 00:55:33,920
them may be different but then in the

1577
00:55:33,920 --> 00:55:36,160
end because you you're new you have the

1578
00:55:36,160 --> 00:55:38,960
benefit of raw data you don't have any

1579
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:41,119
hopefully any politics or anything yet

1580
00:55:41,119 --> 00:55:42,880
right then once you have that full

1581
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:44,720
picture then you can map your line of

1582
00:55:44,720 --> 00:55:45,920
attack

1583
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:47,280
right yeah

1584
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:48,880
yeah

1585
00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:50,319
another question

1586
00:55:50,319 --> 00:55:52,480
thank you uh great session george thank

1587
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:54,400
you very much um when you showed the

1588
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:56,160
risk register earlier and following them

1589
00:55:56,160 --> 00:55:58,000
from the question from the the gentleman

1590
00:55:58,000 --> 00:55:59,440
earlier as well

1591
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:01,040
you talked about the top right quadrant

1592
00:56:01,040 --> 00:56:03,680
do you see more kind of the bottom right

1593
00:56:03,680 --> 00:56:05,200
coming in as well so even though the

1594
00:56:05,200 --> 00:56:07,040
likelihood might

1595
00:56:07,040 --> 00:56:08,400
maybe it's the other way around but even

1596
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:10,480
though the likelihood might be

1597
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:12,880
very low if the impact is going to be

1598
00:56:12,880 --> 00:56:14,160
very high

1599
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:16,640
then there's still a need to mitigate

1600
00:56:16,640 --> 00:56:18,319
that risk so do you see more of that

1601
00:56:18,319 --> 00:56:20,559
coming in absolutely so you're saying

1602
00:56:20,559 --> 00:56:22,880
for the top left quadrant right low

1603
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:24,880
likelihood but high impact

1604
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:27,680
um that that quadrant by the way is

1605
00:56:27,680 --> 00:56:30,960
probably the most controversial meaning

1606
00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:33,280
so many opinions are saying no no it

1607
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:34,720
shouldn't be top left it should be top

1608
00:56:34,720 --> 00:56:36,319
right or it should be top you know

1609
00:56:36,319 --> 00:56:39,119
bottom right right so so i would say

1610
00:56:39,119 --> 00:56:41,040
anything that has high impact which is

1611
00:56:41,040 --> 00:56:43,280
the top half of the graph

1612
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:45,359
warrants a lot of scrutiny

1613
00:56:45,359 --> 00:56:47,839
yeah so so just because if it's if your

1614
00:56:47,839 --> 00:56:49,359
question is just because it isn't the

1615
00:56:49,359 --> 00:56:50,960
top left she would not focus on it

1616
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:54,079
absolutely not absolutely not right

1617
00:56:54,079 --> 00:56:55,920
those bubbles move

1618
00:56:55,920 --> 00:56:57,200
they move

1619
00:56:57,200 --> 00:56:58,880
week over week quarter over quarter so

1620
00:56:58,880 --> 00:57:01,680
this is just a snapshot in time right so

1621
00:57:01,680 --> 00:57:04,240
i i would say yes there should be an

1622
00:57:04,240 --> 00:57:06,720
action plan behind six and seven on this

1623
00:57:06,720 --> 00:57:08,240
chart as well

1624
00:57:08,240 --> 00:57:12,680
yeah yeah great point

1625
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:14,480

1626
00:57:14,480 --> 00:57:16,400

it's going to be my privilege to have a

1640
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:50,960
fireside chat

1641
00:57:50,960 --> 00:57:53,280
with chris inglis the first

1642
00:57:53,280 --> 00:57:55,520

1645
00:57:57,920 --> 00:57:59,920
and so we're going to discuss some of

1646
00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:01,520
the topics i brought up yesterday at the

1647
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:02,720
keynote

1648
00:58:02,720 --> 00:58:05,119
it's going to be kind of a conversation

1649
00:58:05,119 --> 00:58:07,599
but it is going to be incredibly unique

1650
00:58:07,599 --> 00:58:09,680
to have access to someone at that level

1651
00:58:09,680 --> 00:58:11,040
of experience

1652
00:58:11,040 --> 00:58:12,960
that level of sort of national policy

1653
00:58:12,960 --> 00:58:14,559
and insight into what's going on in the

1654
00:58:14,559 --> 00:58:17,040
world today and so i hope you'll join me
