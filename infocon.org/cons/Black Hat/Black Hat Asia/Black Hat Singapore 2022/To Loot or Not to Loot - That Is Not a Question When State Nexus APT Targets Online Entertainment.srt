00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,640
overview about the top five china nexus

58
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,560
apd groups

59
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:33,120
which have been targeting this

60
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,480
industry

61
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:37,200
then our chief analyst charles b

62
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,760
will demonstrate the tdp of the five apt

63
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:40,800
groups

64
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,120
with a cyber kill chain

65
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,599
after knowing that the attacking method

66
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:48,080
uh we will give our strategy as a

67
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:50,959
strategic analysis we will switch the

68
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:53,599
angle and see these abd attacks from the

69
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:56,239
angle of the chinese government

70
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:57,200
and then

71
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,200
we will provide how to mitigate this

72
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,319
threat

73
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:05,560
so without further ado let's get started

74
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,200
to begin our speech it is important to

75
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:12,000
know that the apt campaigns are not only

76
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,920
targeting the government

77
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:16,879
most apt research emphasizes the victim

78
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:19,680
in the government military or critical

79
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,959
infrastructures

80
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:23,519
but since 2018 we have helped many

81
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:24,640
companies

82
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:27,440
in the online entertainment industry

83
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:30,560
until 2020 security researchers properly

84
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:33,120
disclosed the apd also targeted online

85
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,200
entertainment business

86
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,720
for example

87
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:39,680
term michael's operation drp control

88
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:42,959
suggests that china annexes apd-41 and

89
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:46,080
apt-27 by targeting their gambling and

90
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,159
betting entities

91
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:51,280
so based on our observation we will

92
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:54,000
dissect more than 20 targeted attacks

93
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:54,959
against

94
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:57,599
this online entertainment industry since

95
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:00,599
2018.

96
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:04,239
generally speaking the

97
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:06,319
online entertainment industry covers

98
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:08,560
everything from gaming to video

99
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:11,360
streaming but we are here only to focus

100
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:14,799
on the most lucrative business

101
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:16,639
those companies provide entertainment

102
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:18,880
business that can generate strong cash

103
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:19,680
flow

104
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,918
so in our talk we will focus on the

105
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:24,160
companies that are providing gambling

106
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:27,800
and betting services

107
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,240
okay in this map

108
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,560
we will give an overview of the online

109
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:39,759
gambling industry in the apac region

110
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:41,759
for those who are not familiar with this

111
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:44,240
industry are the online gambling

112
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,160
industry in the airport region has

113
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,479
developed into an industry chain

114
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:51,440
crossing philippines taiwan and mainland

115
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:52,479
china

116
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:54,800
the business is often headquartered in

117
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,600
the philippines he ends at the gambling

118
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,560
clients in china so he relies on china's

119
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,960
money and used taiwan's companies to

120
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:06,560
provide engineering and customer service

121
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:10,320
this industry is very broad and

122
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:13,199
worldwide its lucrative nature keeps

123
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:16,240
attracting more young people to join

124
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,160
and the technical business model

125
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,800
including the virtual poker online

126
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:25,400
casinos and sports batting

127
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:28,800
okay uh

128
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,360
this is the player in the game we have

129
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:34,560
seen not just one apt we have seen five

130
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:38,479
china nexus apd groups targeting this

131
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:41,280
gaming and betting industry

132
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,120
on the

133
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:46,000
first you can see the army bar which is

134
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,360
known as the apd-41 or windy and on the

135
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,600
right you can see the greedy tail teeth

136
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,160
which is the abd-27

137
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:57,360
also known as the military panda

138
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,919
and on the left corner you can see ken

139
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:02,479
wu which is also known as the operation

140
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:04,400
dragon cassidy

141
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,560
you can refer this group to our

142
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,240
yesterday's talk

143
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,360
uh

144
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:12,479
programming away

145
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,840
the detail about this programming a-rate

146
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:19,199
will can you can see uh

147
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:22,560
our previous disclosed research with

148
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:25,440
everest uh in last month

149
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:28,160
and the rest of the two are slide 29 and

150
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,400
slide 34.

151
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:33,280
intentify's database the sign means that

152
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:35,199
our intelligence team believe this group

153
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:36,720
is a cluster

154
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,800
but it needs more campaigns and

155
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:42,319
indicators to group into a formal apt

156
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:43,280
group

157
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:44,639
so

158
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:48,479
uh based on our ins research

159
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:51,199
we can see yet you can see here we can

160
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:53,520
see these five groups

161
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,680
have somehow connection with other

162
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:58,319
chinese apd groups such as you can see

163
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:00,960
the scientific board here it has a tool

164
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:03,360
overlap with manual pass

165
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:06,720
and you can see chiang wu and slime 29

166
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:09,680
has two overlapped with amiba

167
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:13,199
and you can see slide 29 also have

168
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:15,599
a victim overlap in the greedy with the

169
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:18,639
greedytauty which means that in a

170
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:21,919
victim's environment we see both side29s

171
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:24,560
environments uh malware and the greedy

172
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:27,599
tardis malwares so

173
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:29,919
okay after introduction of this player

174
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:32,639
in the game our chief analyst chelsea

175
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:36,160
will show their ttps with the cyber kill

176
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:38,240
chain

177
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,240
and back to you charles

178
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,960
okay hello everyone uh in the following

179
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:46,880
sections i'm going to introduce a ttps

180
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:50,560
we have observed in the attacks we

181
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:54,000
investigated for the past years

182
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,039
so we will start from the viewpoint of

183
00:07:57,039 --> 00:07:59,120
the victim which are online

184
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,280
entertainment industry

185
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:04,720
and our discussion will follow the

186
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:07,680
cyber kill chain phases in case unknown

187
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,360
is unfamiliar

188
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:13,639
they are a weaponization

189
00:08:13,639 --> 00:08:17,199
weaponization and

190
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,599
reconnaissance

191
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:21,120
reconnaissance

192
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:24,879
delivery exploitation

193
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:29,360
installation command and control

194
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,680
lateral movement and

195
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:35,680
exfiltration yeah next

196
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:38,559
okay we will start from weaponization uh

197
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:41,440
it is hard for us to get into how three

198
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:44,320
actors weaponize their tools however we

199
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:47,120
can reach some conclusion after reverse

200
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:49,680
engineering their tools

201
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:52,880
okay so our observation shows that most

202
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:55,760
of them apply handy tools

203
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,760
they just modify

204
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:00,640
these tools a little bit such as adding

205
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:03,760
some packers wrappers to prevent from

206
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,200
detection

207
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:08,640
and they also prepare some proper tools

208
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,959
that develop for maintaining

209
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:12,320
excess

210
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,640
or in lateral movement phases which we

211
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,240
will discuss later

212
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,480
next

213
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,360
reconnaissance would be the phase that

214
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,360
we want to discuss more

215
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:26,880
because uh in our investigation we were

216
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:30,080
very curious uh why this straight actor

217
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:34,000
could pinpoint to a specific individual

218
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,440
or uh

219
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:38,640
top network infrastructure to target

220
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:41,120
because unlike other

221
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:44,000
industries online entertainment

222
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,360
companies they tend to vary profile

223
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,240
so

224
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:51,440
we propose some scenario this reactor

225
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,360
could uh

226
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:56,160
get information about their target

227
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:59,600
the first scenario uh we assume this

228
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,839
reactor might have some underground

229
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:04,720
sources or secret sources

230
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:07,680
to get access to this uh online

231
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:10,320
entertainment company so they can use

232
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:13,279
this information as late to start their

233
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:14,720
attack

234
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:17,440
the second scenario we assume this

235
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:20,320
reactor could start their attack from a

236
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:23,760
recruiting website or forum because our

237
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:26,959
research shows that these places

238
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:28,399
have the most

239
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:30,800
information about this online

240
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,880
entertainment companies

241
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,240
the third

242
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:37,680
we assume this reactor could pretend to

243
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:40,000
be distributor of this online

244
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
entertainment company

245
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,760
because to

246
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:46,560
operate their business they have to

247
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:49,519
cooperate with many local distributors

248
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:52,079
so this transactor will pretend to be

249
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:54,959
some low-end distributor saying that hey

250
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:57,839
i can help you promote your business can

251
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:00,959
i get access to you something like that

252
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:03,680
yeah next

253
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,480
okay the next in the next i'm going to

254
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:09,760
discuss the delivery and exploitation

255
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,760
basis

256
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:12,800
in this

257
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,399
in this part

258
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:17,760
specification would be a big method used

259
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:21,279
by these three actors to conduct attack

260
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:22,079
and

261
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:25,839
the employees of these companies

262
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:27,760
are a big target

263
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:30,560
this reactor they usually

264
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:34,079
prepare some daily work related document

265
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:37,040
such as you can see in the right side

266
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:40,079
some website photo some financial

267
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:41,440
statement

268
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:44,560
some or even some pink state

269
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:49,200
this ikg document can easily your users

270
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,839
into opening these malicious files

271
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:54,160
next

272
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:58,000
customer support is another big target

273
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,800
for these three actors because they act

274
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:03,519
as a contact window of these

275
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:06,000
online entertainment companies

276
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,880
in several of our investigation we see

277
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:11,680
threat actor pretending to be their

278
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:14,079
customer and they send

279
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:17,120
emails complaining about some system

280
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,240
issue

281
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:21,600
for example some three actors sent a

282
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:25,040
message file saying that hey i encounter

283
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:27,040
some bugs in

284
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:29,920
your system and

285
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:32,560
i attach the screenshot which you help

286
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:33,920
me check

287
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:38,320
in another case the three actress

288
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,680
that

289
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:42,639
i cannot access your platform using my

290
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:44,720
browser i attached

291
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:47,519
my browser installer which will help me

292
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:48,720
verify

293
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:51,519
in this cases because this customer's

294
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:52,880
support team

295
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:56,000
they are keen to help address this issue

296
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,480
so they tend to open this malicious

297
00:12:58,480 --> 00:12:59,680
document

298
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:03,120
malicious files and got infected

299
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:06,120
next

300
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:09,760
aside from a specific email uh this

301
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:12,079
reactor also uh

302
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:13,440
they are also

303
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:16,800
actively hunting their targets on some

304
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:19,040
social network platform

305
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:22,079
such as a

306
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:24,880
technical discussion forum linkedin

307
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,880
facebook etc

308
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:27,920
they

309
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:30,880
they will pre craft some

310
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:34,240
profile on this platform to approach

311
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:37,839
sales team id or developer of their

312
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:39,680
targeted company

313
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:42,639
in case they make a contact with their

314
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:46,639
targets they can easily make an excuse

315
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:50,880
and send a link by using car driver or

316
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:53,040
some custom web server

317
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,600
to deal with their targets into opening

318
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,440
this malicious file

319
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:00,320
the screenshot shows in real case we

320
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:03,360
have investigated the three actors we

321
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,440
tend to be some

322
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:06,480
uh

323
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:09,279
online entertainment employees to

324
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:11,199
approach some

325
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:14,320
end-time ccp media

326
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:18,560
to attack uh during the investigation we

327
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:22,079
discovered that the three actors also

328
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:25,199
created another profile on linkedin to

329
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:27,600
attack other online entertainment

330
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,199
companies

331
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:31,760
next

332
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:35,199
okay us uh besides using uh sufficient

333
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:38,240
email this three actors are aggressively

334
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:41,839
collecting uh vulnerability to attack uh

335
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:46,560
internet facing server such as exchange

336
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:50,880
vpn server and in a case in 2021

337
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:54,079
something actor you also used a chrome

338
00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:56,079
browser

339
00:14:56,079 --> 00:15:00,480
exploit to conduct watering hole

340
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:03,600
besides that uh what a server and not

341
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,839
server of the online entertainment

342
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:07,040
company

343
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,079
uh can

344
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:09,279
uh

345
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:11,360
we we hope we

346
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:14,560
are often used by the threat actor as

347
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:16,160
football to

348
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:17,600
infiltrate

349
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:21,680
into the intra network of their targets

350
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:24,000
next

351
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:27,760
supply chain is also a common

352
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:28,639
uh

353
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:29,760
method

354
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:32,720
of the reactor to attack

355
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:36,320
in a case uh we investigated uh some

356
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:38,959
three actors they compromised a erp

357
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:41,519
system of a victim company

358
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:44,800
because they find some web availability

359
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:48,079
and after that they use the erp function

360
00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:51,440
to distribute their malware directly

361
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,959
including

362
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:55,920
crosswalk and furnish switch to the

363
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:58,800
employee computer and to several servers

364
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,959
of the victim company

365
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:03,120
next

366
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,680
in another case some threat actor

367
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:09,079
compromised a official website of the

368
00:16:09,079 --> 00:16:11,360
cryptocurrency company

369
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,480
this time

370
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:15,360
he replaced the installation package

371
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:18,560
with this uh trojanized version

372
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:19,519
so

373
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:22,639
in case some customer of this company

374
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:26,079
download and install their software then

375
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:27,040
we

376
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:29,040
got infected

377
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:31,279
next

378
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:34,480
in the next section i'm going to switch

379
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,800
to the male relations by the three

380
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:39,759
actors and their post exploitation

381
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:41,440
activities

382
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:43,680
next

383
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:46,800
because of the time limit i'm not going

384
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:49,120
i'm not going to dive into technical

385
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:52,560
detail of each male where instead i just

386
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,240
listed the

387
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:58,000
adversary group and nowhere used by them

388
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,920
note that there is some items i must

389
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:05,919
rate which means our observation

390
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:08,240
shows that these tools could be only

391
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:11,679
used in online entertainment attacks

392
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:14,400
meaning that they could be created

393
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:17,199
specifically for this

394
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:19,359
kind of targets

395
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:24,000
so uh slide 29 in the uh

396
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:24,959
fly

397
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:26,240
down corner

398
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:29,440
they could be the one that focused on my

399
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:32,640
entertainment industry the most

400
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:35,919
because most of their tools are only

401
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:38,559
used to protect online entertainment

402
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:41,280
industry

403
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:43,520
amiibas

404
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,039
in controversy

405
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:48,160
they used their malware in online

406
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:51,600
entertainment attack or

407
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,520
other attacks

408
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:57,039
together however

409
00:17:57,039 --> 00:18:00,000
we see that this reactor created some

410
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,720
simple backdoor or iron spectrum that i

411
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,799
will introduce later

412
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:08,639
to maintain access to

413
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:09,600
the

414
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,919
network of some online entertainment

415
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:13,280
company

416
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:16,720
and the other three uh adversary groups

417
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:19,280
including tien grenty taughty and

418
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:20,559
slightly

419
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:23,600
we didn't see they create a specific

420
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:26,840
tool for online entertainment

421
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:30,080
targets next

422
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:31,919
the first uh

423
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:34,720
tool i'm going to introduce is the iis

424
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:35,840
backdoor

425
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:39,120
the iii the ida pro screenshot shows

426
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:42,400
that the spectro implemented several

427
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:47,200
interface of the c http http module

428
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:50,640
meaning that this tool acts as a

429
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:53,520
module of iis server

430
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:57,360
in this case next

431
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:01,520
the actor can access the victim iis

432
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:03,120
server to

433
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:05,840
access the

434
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:08,840
internal network of the victim content

435
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:11,440
directory because the

436
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:13,600
backdoor will

437
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:17,440
upon execution it will start a

438
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:21,360
connection to the sequel database and

439
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:24,320
next

440
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:27,840
from the uh comment it

441
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:30,880
executed we can see that the thread

442
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:31,919
factor

443
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:34,559
keeps uh collecting and

444
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:36,000
uh

445
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:40,559
filtrating the uh data flow cash flow of

446
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:41,919
the uh

447
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:45,760
victim company they use this is vector

448
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:49,360
to keep access to this vixen company and

449
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:51,520
their uh uh

450
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:54,640
and collect a uh data

451
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:57,600
note that the three actor left a pdb

452
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,520
string here

453
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:03,919
and uh the pdp string shows that uh the

454
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:05,200
three actor

455
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:09,120
put this tool under a project called x

456
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:10,240
project

457
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:13,679
we speculate uh the three actors created

458
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:17,679
this x project for this specific victim

459
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:21,039
or the this project is further for the

460
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:21,919
whole

461
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:24,720
online entertainment industry

462
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,799
next

463
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:30,000
i'm going to introduce a sql backdoor

464
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,000
next

465
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:36,080
this tool

466
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:38,880
that the purpose of this tool is to lock

467
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,640
the uh

468
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:44,400
data transaction flow of uh the sql

469
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,159
server and

470
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:49,280
lock the collected data in a clear text

471
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:51,679
thumb file in the victim host

472
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:53,919
which the thread actor could collect

473
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:57,679
manually later next

474
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:01,600
it achieved this function by doing some

475
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:05,600
hot page to a sql server module which is

476
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:09,120
a sequel length.dll and install some

477
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:11,679
shortcode in some critical

478
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:15,600
apis in case this api is code and the

479
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,919
show code is executed

480
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:18,720
the

481
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:22,080
data flow will be logged into the file i

482
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:23,600
mentioned

483
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,520
next

484
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:28,480
this tool is also disclosed in instead

485
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:33,039
of reporting 2019 and we observe it in

486
00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:36,480
my entertainment company attack in 2020.

487
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:38,720
next

488
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:40,799
next i'm going to

489
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:43,840
talk about the lateral moon and the

490
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:44,960
phase

491
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:47,360
in the natural movement part

492
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:49,840
uh the three actors still they rely

493
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:53,039
mostly uh of the show's tools including

494
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:58,159
npt scan psdx ec pw dungeons cats etc

495
00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:01,679
and their malwares are usually equipped

496
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:02,960
with a

497
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:05,360
potential harvesting tool

498
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:06,320
function

499
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:09,120
or they would use dictionary attack or

500
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:11,440
some exploits such as

501
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:12,880
eternal blood

502
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:16,960
that helps them for previous escalation

503
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:19,440
and these three actors they usually

504
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:22,000
divided their little

505
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,400
lateral movement populations into two

506
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:25,440
stages

507
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:29,200
in the first stage upon entering a new

508
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:31,919
network environment they created some

509
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:35,919
automatic tools or script to do a quick

510
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:38,240
environment reconnaissance

511
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:40,880
after uh obtaining this kind of

512
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,559
information

513
00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:45,679
in the second stage some experienced

514
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:49,520
hacker were involved in and started

515
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:53,440
precise strikes to against some critical

516
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:56,960
server such as aiding server or

517
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,559
exchange server

518
00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:00,879
next

519
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:05,520
in the filtration phase three actors

520
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:09,200
rely on some cloud storage platform a

521
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,240
lot

522
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:13,200
such as team will be a popular cloud

523
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:16,720
storage platform in china or dropbox

524
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:19,520
this reactor they created some free

525
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:22,640
accounts on this uh cloud storage

526
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:25,120
platform and their male wear will

527
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:27,520
communicate with this account

528
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:30,799
in this case the actor will stay behind

529
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:32,159
this class

530
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:35,360
and issue command to their uh

531
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:39,760
aware or exfiltrate a document that is

532
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:41,760
interesting to them

533
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:43,919
next

534
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:46,559
okay in the next section i'm going to

535
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:47,600
discuss

536
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:50,960
some three actors deploy ransomware

537
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:53,520
because our later discussion will

538
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:56,559
consider using of ransomware as an

539
00:23:56,559 --> 00:23:58,240
indicator that

540
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:01,039
this trade actor is interested in

541
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:02,640
financial gain

542
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:05,360
next

543
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:08,480
slide 34 is the first group i'm going to

544
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,240
introduce

545
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:14,000
uh started from second half of 2021st

546
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,039
till now they have deployed several

547
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:19,600
ransomware including block file

548
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:23,840
intensity or road night sky etc to

549
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:26,400
attack various industries

550
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,240
across the world

551
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:31,840
they usually rely on some

552
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:34,159
internet uh

553
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:37,360
facing server exploits such as proxy

554
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:40,559
shield to install their new

555
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:42,720
which is combo strike pickup

556
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:46,400
and they also use some exploits such as

557
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,159
petit protein

558
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:49,279
to help

559
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:51,679
in their

560
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:53,919
lateral movement phases

561
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:56,799
to gain hyperbolic privilege

562
00:24:56,799 --> 00:24:59,360
in the end they will improve

563
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:00,640
some way

564
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:02,960
next

565
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:07,440
amnibar conducted in reserve attack in

566
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:11,039
may 2020 and the target is

567
00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:13,279
several critical infrastructure or

568
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:16,000
high-tech company in china

569
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,640
our investigation shows that their

570
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:22,320
attacks start from web compromise and

571
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:26,720
deploy a cargo strike beacon into some

572
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,720
infected hosts

573
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:32,000
and they started their lateral movement

574
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,279
to gain access to the ad server and use

575
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:38,000
the ad server to deploy

576
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,039
their proprietary plans and

577
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:43,760
called luck into the whole victory new

578
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:44,799
york

579
00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:47,120
next

580
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:51,760
regitati they attacked a media outlet in

581
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:56,480
april 2020 and used the ransomware they

582
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:59,360
also started this attack from web

583
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:02,159
compromise and they installed

584
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:04,080
this update uh

585
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:06,080
nowhere

586
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:09,360
i uh after some latin movement

587
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:10,559
operations

588
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:14,080
they gain higher privilege so they can

589
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:14,880
uh

590
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:18,960
deploy uh polar ransomware which is also

591
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:22,159
a proprietary ransomware

592
00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:25,919
to greedy county to the victim network

593
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:28,159
next

594
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:31,360
flight 20 line they attacked several

595
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:34,400
online entertainment companies in early

596
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:38,320
2020 they stopped from sandusky fishing

597
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:41,279
innotech and they installed several

598
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:44,400
different mirrors in the victim folks

599
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:47,200
after a successful lateral movement

600
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:49,679
they used bitlocker which is a

601
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:51,200
legitimate

602
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:54,640
disk encryption tools to encrypt the

603
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:57,919
file of the victim host and started

604
00:26:57,919 --> 00:27:00,480
their recent attacks

605
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,320
yeah okay

606
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:05,120
that's all for my part

607
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:09,360
okay uh after understanding the tdp of

608
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:11,679
these apd groups uh

609
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:13,360
we want to further expand our

610
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:16,080
observation of these five groups uh we

611
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:18,240
are here to discuss the political

612
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:21,039
motivation behind those campaigns

613
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:25,760
aiming at the online gaming industry

614
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:27,360
okay

615
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:29,279
the online gaming companies have a

616
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:31,840
strong cash flow as we all know it is

617
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:34,240
natural to think that all the attacks

618
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:36,400
are coming for the money

619
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:38,799
and the company in this industry usually

620
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:41,440
believe the most important threat is the

621
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:44,320
ddos or the disruptive attack from their

622
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:46,400
competitors but

623
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:47,679
our

624
00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:50,559
are suggesting that we are worried that

625
00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:53,760
these apt attacks might be the

626
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:56,480
data control or the crackdown of the

627
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:59,760
australian government

628
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:02,640
because we can see that all these apd

629
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:06,480
groups except for a slide 29 all have

630
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:08,559
aiming at the

631
00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:11,120
both the governments and the critical

632
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:13,600
infrastructure i we believe these four

633
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:16,960
apd groups have the motivation to

634
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:18,399
espionage

635
00:28:18,399 --> 00:28:21,039
so uh in the other division we only

636
00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:24,960
correlated that slight 29th activity

637
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:27,200
only aiming at the victims with strong

638
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:29,679
cash flow such as a company in gambling

639
00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:33,000
or cryptocurrencies

640
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,600
so

641
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:39,039
to as a apt expert we would like to

642
00:28:39,039 --> 00:28:40,559
complement the traditional

643
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:43,440
classification of apd research

644
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:44,799
traditionally

645
00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:47,440
cyber crime is aiming for monetary gain

646
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:50,559
and cyber espionage is leading personal

647
00:28:50,559 --> 00:28:53,200
information and private data

648
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:55,840
and they are separate but as we talk

649
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:58,880
about this in the

650
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:01,279
online gambling industry and in our

651
00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:02,799
previous slides

652
00:29:02,799 --> 00:29:05,440
the apd research mainly focus on apt's

653
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:07,440
political motivation

654
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:09,919
so we would like to introduce the

655
00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:12,480
indicator of money

656
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:14,799
with these indicators we believe that

657
00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:16,960
some at groups are not just for

658
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:19,440
espionage for example

659
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:21,520
if they use the malware such as

660
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:24,000
ransomware or crypto miners

661
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:28,720
and this for some in some cases for like

662
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:32,240
amiba which is known as apt41 which has

663
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:35,200
been indicted for the being the private

664
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:37,760
security company in china and hired for

665
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:40,799
the by the chinese government and so

666
00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:43,520
with these indicators we can show that

667
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:46,240
more these factors will give these abd

668
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:48,559
groups more motivation to

669
00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:49,440
uh

670
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:52,720
one's monetary gain

671
00:29:53,679 --> 00:29:56,880
okay so switch the gear the less our

672
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:59,760
strategic analysis section the political

673
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:04,159
motivation of these apd groups are uh

674
00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:06,720
showing that they are uh strongly

675
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:08,559
aligned with the

676
00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:10,799
interest of the chinese government so we

677
00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:12,559
would like to discuss the possible

678
00:30:12,559 --> 00:30:15,120
scenario for the chinese government to

679
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:17,760
put so much pressure on the online

680
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:22,760
gambling industry in this apac region

681
00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:25,279
uh here's the news suggesting that china

682
00:30:25,279 --> 00:30:27,200
is putting more effort into the

683
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,799
crackdown of the

684
00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:31,279
gambling industry we have seen lots of

685
00:30:31,279 --> 00:30:35,039
avd attacks emerge in 2018 and finally

686
00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:37,440
that we have seen a lot of news to show

687
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:39,919
that china has cracked down on macau and

688
00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:42,000
accused the people in this charge of

689
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:45,039
this gambling business have used this

690
00:30:45,039 --> 00:30:47,919
kind of online gaming companies for

691
00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:50,720
money laundering and

692
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:53,679
to deceive the spoiled young people in

693
00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:55,760
china

694
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:56,720
so

695
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:59,440
with the geopolitical landscape china is

696
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:01,919
facing more challenges when it comes to

697
00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:04,799
stabilizing this country

698
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:05,919
we believe

699
00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:07,440
china's crackdown on the gambling

700
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:10,960
industry is helping it to stabilize the

701
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:15,120
maintainer stability maintenance

702
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:19,120
our first scenario to suggest that this

703
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:21,440
ap goes my aiming at this online

704
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:24,799
gambling company is because to

705
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:26,799
help the chinese government to collect

706
00:31:26,799 --> 00:31:29,520
more information because these companies

707
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:30,799
have

708
00:31:30,799 --> 00:31:34,240
the information to about this maybe the

709
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:36,720
karate political figure so

710
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:38,720
if we can stop uh collect more

711
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:40,960
information from this company we can

712
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:43,279
start the anti-corruption campaign

713
00:31:43,279 --> 00:31:45,679
within the chinese government

714
00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:48,480
and they with the information of this

715
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:50,720
company they can bring up the related

716
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:53,279
infrastructure used by this company

717
00:31:53,279 --> 00:31:55,919
inside china and they can take down the

718
00:31:55,919 --> 00:31:58,080
involved companies

719
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:01,440
so our second scenario is that with a

720
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:04,159
more strategic reason we believe to take

721
00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:07,200
on this online gaming company is a way

722
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:08,320
to

723
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:11,360
control the china's capital outlook

724
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:13,360
because based on the china's official

725
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:15,679
report these online gaming companies

726
00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:17,840
caused china's capital outflow

727
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:20,320
dramatically so we believe the crackdown

728
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:22,799
of these gambling companies can help the

729
00:32:22,799 --> 00:32:25,120
chinese government to control the money

730
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:28,120
flow

731
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:31,039
above all this as a defender side the

732
00:32:31,039 --> 00:32:33,039
most important question is how can we

733
00:32:33,039 --> 00:32:36,159
protect ourselves

734
00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:38,320
this is the diamond model of today's

735
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:41,360
speech you can see that we have seen the

736
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:44,240
five china nexus apd groups targeting

737
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:46,880
the online gambling industry so we are

738
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:49,279
here worried that to

739
00:32:49,279 --> 00:32:50,159
uh

740
00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:51,039
list

741
00:32:51,039 --> 00:32:54,320
threats are not just a one-time deal

742
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:57,200
they are persistent threat against this

743
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:00,000
industry and they are the threat that

744
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,120
mostly neglected by the companies inside

745
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:06,080
this industry

746
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:09,679
and our account manager is also based on

747
00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:11,840
a kill chain in the first

748
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:13,760
phase of the kill chain if you want to

749
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:16,799
stop the hacker for the initial assets

750
00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:20,000
the basic measure to uh

751
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,080
i think the basic measure is to make

752
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:24,720
sure everyone in this organization

753
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:27,679
to maintain the high quality of cyber

754
00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:28,799
hygiene

755
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:31,600
and to protect ourselves is to build

756
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:33,679
isolation between the operational

757
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:36,480
environment the development environment

758
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:38,960
and the office office automation

759
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:40,159
environment

760
00:33:40,159 --> 00:33:42,640
and it's important to catch up with the

761
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:44,880
uh

762
00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:48,399
is catch up with a new hacking tools

763
00:33:48,399 --> 00:33:50,960
technique uh which is

764
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:54,880
discussed by the security community

765
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:56,399
okay

766
00:33:56,399 --> 00:33:59,279
the next step is to how to avoid the

767
00:33:59,279 --> 00:34:01,840
hacker's exploitation

768
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:03,679
it's important to

769
00:34:03,679 --> 00:34:06,159
just simple way to patch all the system

770
00:34:06,159 --> 00:34:08,960
and service you use we also recommend

771
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:11,440
that doing the regular drill such as the

772
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:14,639
wrapping assessment

773
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,560
to for the malware presentation we found

774
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:21,119
that the threat actors

775
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:24,320
uh like to design malware for supporting

776
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:26,879
various protocols or using legitimate

777
00:34:26,879 --> 00:34:28,239
cloud platform

778
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:31,040
such as just child just mentioned

779
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:31,839
so

780
00:34:31,839 --> 00:34:33,119
it is

781
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:35,520
important to check the protocol and the

782
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:37,760
c2 information which is our skeleton

783
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:40,800
cover uh in the defending and defecting

784
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:44,960
service such as i firewall ips ids and

785
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:46,000
the

786
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:49,839
modern edr products

787
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:53,839
so uh in the next final phase of that

788
00:34:53,839 --> 00:34:56,800
it's important to know that if the

789
00:34:56,800 --> 00:35:00,160
hacker already into the lateral movement

790
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:02,560
part it is hard to

791
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:03,839
defend

792
00:35:03,839 --> 00:35:05,920
into the hardest part to defend

793
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:08,160
and that's often saying that the hacker

794
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:11,359
don't hack in they just log in so if the

795
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:13,839
hacker already into the lateral movement

796
00:35:13,839 --> 00:35:15,839
part

797
00:35:15,839 --> 00:35:18,079
have to make sure you have checked your

798
00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:20,560
backward account which is like the

799
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:22,560
backdoor key is

800
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:25,599
often neglected in your environment

801
00:35:25,599 --> 00:35:28,560
and we have a basic suggestions to

802
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:31,839
confirming to to check all the

803
00:35:31,839 --> 00:35:33,680
suspicious connections

804
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:34,960
and to

805
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:37,040
block the opportunity for hackers to

806
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:39,839
enter the internet and to

807
00:35:39,839 --> 00:35:42,839
patch all the internet

808
00:35:42,839 --> 00:35:45,440
systems okay

809
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:48,400
this is our key takeaway today

810
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:50,160
we believe that our speech has

811
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:52,640
demonstrated that the chinese apd groups

812
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:55,200
are posing a greater threat to the

813
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:57,200
online entertainment business in this

814
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:58,880
apec region

815
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:00,800
and these threat groups are coming for

816
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:03,119
monetary gain and they are coming for

817
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:04,160
the

818
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:07,760
important private information so

819
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:09,599
i think our

820
00:36:09,599 --> 00:36:10,560
uh

821
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:13,040
fundamental suggestion is to start the

822
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:16,240
threat and purchase cycles of this uh

823
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:17,280
target

824
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:21,040
from as a target as a defender side so

825
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:23,520
the first step is to defending those

826
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:27,920
threat groups is to knowing the tdps and

827
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:30,160
using the external intelligence provided

828
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:31,920
by the security vendors

829
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:35,040
such as tmt5 is a first way to keep the

830
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:37,839
organization's states very safe

831
00:36:37,839 --> 00:36:40,000
and we believe the chinese government is

832
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,480
putting more effort into cracking down

833
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:44,400
on the entitlement entertainment

834
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:45,599
business

835
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:48,160
and we can see a clear correlation

836
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:50,800
between the apt actors

837
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:55,400
attacks and china's crackdown

838
00:36:55,599 --> 00:36:58,560
so this is our

839
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:03,520
ioc uh we just list this only c2 of the

840
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:05,520
the five apd groups we just mentioned

841
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:07,839
earlier

842
00:37:07,839 --> 00:37:11,200
thank you this is all we got today

843
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:13,440
please feel free to ask any question or

844
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:16,079
give us any feedback thank you

845
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:18,840
thank you

846
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:21,909
