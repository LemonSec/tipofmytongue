2
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:09,599
hi everyone

3
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:10,800
thank you for

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:12,800
attending our session

5
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:13,599
so

6
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:15,759
today we are going to discuss about

7
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:18,160
mobile botnet and

8
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:20,880
you know how we uncovered it and how

9
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:22,640
these cyber criminals are taking

10
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:25,760
advantage of it by monetizing

11
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:28,800
and we are also going to present

12
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,880
how the mobile supply chain attacks you

13
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:34,480
know takes role in propelling the

14
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:36,000
manifestation of the cyber crime

15
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,640
business model so we have been

16
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,960
researching this for the past months we

17
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:42,480
are still continue

18
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:45,840
monitoring it and um

19
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:47,600
it's because of my fellow core

20
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:49,600
researchers namely

21
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:52,079
zhangyu dong our mobile threat analyst

22
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:55,039
from mobile china and then

23
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:57,440
forward looking threat researchers

24
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:58,960
namely theodore

25
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:01,039
ryan and vladimir

26
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:03,760
also thanks for our editors headed by

27
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:06,640
abigail and so yeah our session for

28
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:09,119
today is about

29
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:11,200
this firmware supply chain if you

30
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:13,439
attended yesterday um

31
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:15,360
it's about how they

32
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:18,080
uh you know um the complexity and how

33
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,280
they solve the issue and the

34
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,439
vulnerabilities but on our side it's

35
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:24,159
about the cyber criminals are you know

36
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:27,200
embedding this or deliberately embedding

37
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,560
this um

38
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:31,360
malicious loaders so

39
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,920
our agenda briefly discuss the history

40
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:36,400
of mobile supply chain attacks um some

41
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,079
of the notable incidents with

42
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:41,280
pre-installed malware purchased that

43
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,159
were reported we then delve into the

44
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:45,360
lemon group

45
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,680
so these are responsible for the mobile

46
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:48,880
botnet

47
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:51,200
we say that they are chinese speaking

48
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,399
individuals

49
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:54,720
then how they monetize the services

50
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:57,759
using the sms service and proxy service

51
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:00,960
of course implications um impact

52
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,399
conclusion

53
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:04,640
and some recommendations how to stay

54
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,079
protected

55
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:09,119
right so terms which i will be using

56
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:12,400
interchangeably during the presentation

57
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:15,040
so as cited online in mobile industry

58
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,640
oem stands for

59
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:19,280
um original equipment manufacturer so

60
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,560
these are the companies who have their

61
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:23,440
own factories who manufacture phones

62
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:24,239
but

63
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:26,640
as for example the lg and samsung and

64
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,720
then odm our original design

65
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,720
manufacturer also they have the

66
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:31,840
factories

67
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,360
and they

68
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,720
manufacture phones usually in bulk

69
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,959
manner when oem

70
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:40,560
started to manufacture phone they will

71
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,480
embed the android

72
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,879
basic android os then they will

73
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:46,319
head over the system image the

74
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:48,000
third-party vendors

75
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,120
and so

76
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:52,000
they will provide additional features in

77
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,080
the software after doing so they will

78
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,319
revert it back to the oem

79
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:58,720
and so oem can prepare to sell it in

80
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:02,480
market through the retailers

81
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,680
and then when it lands to consumer it

82
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,360
needs an update in the firmware so

83
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,680
farewell is basically the lowest level

84
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:12,159
of software that has direct interaction

85
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:13,599
with the hardware

86
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:17,599
so firmware is actually um

87
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:20,319
firmware over the air or

88
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:21,760
you know ever since the android was

89
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:24,400
created ota was required and so there's

90
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,640
also coined the word um

91
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,400
software ota

92
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:31,599
phone verified accounts services

93
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:34,000
this is a security mechanism that is

94
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,319
employed by platforms and service

95
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:37,599
providers

96
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:39,440
in order to prevent fake and bot

97
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,480
accounts

98
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,319
which can be used for like spam fake

99
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:43,680
news and

100
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:47,519
as a means to perpetuate online harm

101
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:49,040
you can see here the guerrilla malware

102
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:51,599
we will discuss it later and this image

103
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:55,040
flow chart originated from

104
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:57,599
the researcher named lucas i hope i

105
00:03:57,599 --> 00:03:59,840
pronounced it correctly so they are from

106
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,760
google they reported about the triad of

107
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:04,000
malware involved in mobile supply chain

108
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,920
attacks and so

109
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:08,000
we can say that gorilla and triad are

110
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,400
both prevalent malware in terms of

111
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,319
mobile supply chain attacks

112
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:15,439
and that um they were able to help the

113
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:19,358
oem to disinfect the votes

114
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:22,079
so the rise of the or the growth of the

115
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:23,759
android market is also the rise in the

116
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:25,040
demand of

117
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:28,400
reflashing services in in china the

118
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:31,199
rampant customization of rome

119
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:33,680
became rampant

120
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,600
because we know android os is an open

121
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,720
source software and sorry

122
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,639
the malware is activated when you

123
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:43,040
purchase the phone when you boot it

124
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,440
but of course the antiviruses can detect

125
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,759
it but over and over again so the only

126
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:50,080
way is to disinfect is to re-flash the

127
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,120
firmware

128
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:54,080
now the low-cost mobile device company

129
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:57,520
manufacturers they often mass produce

130
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:00,720
and so they can also negotiate to some

131
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,120
third-party vendors for a cheaper price

132
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,639
and i think that's where the compromise

133
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:06,720
can occur and so

134
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,000
um

135
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,479
not to say that the quality assurance

136
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:12,160
may be possibly

137
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:14,800
overlooked because maybe issue in budget

138
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,120
resource and time

139
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,320
now

140
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,440
this is

141
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:20,639
the

142
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:23,919
timeline of some notable mobile supply

143
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:26,080
chain incidents first we take a look at

144
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:28,160
the silent plug-in

145
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,160
here you can see that

146
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,639
it was in 2011 to 2012.

147
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:34,479
the good news is they got arrested it

148
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:36,160
was in this

149
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,639
news article in china saying mobile

150
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:41,120
phone trojan stole 20 million of

151
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,880
contacts so that's a lot

152
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:46,560
so in here they developed silent plug-in

153
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,880
matter of fact in fact the device is 400

154
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,160
000

155
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,080
involved by 10 persons and three

156
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:55,199
companies and the crime is illegally

157
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:57,199
obtaining data

158
00:05:57,199 --> 00:05:59,840
and making money out of it

159
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:02,400
so in 2011 to 2012 they developed this

160
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,000
plug in because

161
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,560
reflashing is not attractive anymore and

162
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,319
that

163
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:10,800
in mid 2012 they start sending the

164
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,800
personal information

165
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,240
to the server

166
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:17,039
and they got discovered and in 2013 they

167
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:18,479
got arrested

168
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:20,639
one actor put behind bars for about

169
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:22,639
three and a half years um

170
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:23,840
seven eight

171
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:26,319
hundred us dollars for fine

172
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:28,479
well the thing is there are there were

173
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:30,720
three companies colluded one company

174
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,880
promoting the app store the app store

175
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:35,280
and thing is the developer and then the

176
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,280
last company is the one thing providing

177
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,440
rom packages promote software for

178
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,520
developers with a fee and so they

179
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:44,000
generated a lot of revenue

180
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,840
out of the private data so we also

181
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,160
emphasize here law enforcement and the

182
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,479
police investigation is possible when

183
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:52,560
crime is committed um

184
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:55,039
domestically and we found the samples

185
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:57,360
it's not triata it's not gorilla but

186
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,840
likely a photo update

187
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:02,240
tampered update

188
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:05,199
all right triad emerged in 2016 as

189
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:07,680
described by kaspersky modularized

190
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,599
mobile trojan

191
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:13,599
first case of triada with oem is with

192
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:15,360
2017

193
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,960
which i mentioned earlier

194
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,880
from researcher lucas they helped the

195
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:21,199
oem manufacturers to disinfect the

196
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:22,240
phones

197
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:25,680
and in 2019 brian krebs reported about

198
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,919
vendor called yahoo

199
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:30,400
or blaze fire they were able

200
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,240
to i think

201
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,599
um

202
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:36,400
say that triada was involved in embedded

203
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,240
in the oem image and

204
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,240
the trojanized version of whatsapp and

205
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:43,599
apk pure or compromised sdk

206
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:44,720
software

207
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:47,759
now these are examples of thousands of

208
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:49,680
low-cost mobile phones

209
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:53,199
in africa and with embedded of triada

210
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:55,680
the german smartphone

211
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:58,400
manufacturer their photo opta update

212
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,720
server got compromised and there were

213
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,560
malicious loaders while actually

214
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:05,039
downloading a malware

215
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:07,039
so a sudden installation without

216
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:08,879
notifying the

217
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:09,919
user

218
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:11,840
and so even you delete the app it keeps

219
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,840
on spawning because of the

220
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:16,639
updated servers so the best way is to

221
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:18,720
um

222
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:21,599
what they call this disable the update

223
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:24,800
so we found a company named redstone ota

224
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:27,039
supplier of gigaset we found in

225
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:28,879
virustotal that

226
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:32,080
some packages detected

227
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,640
the what we call this

228
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:37,640
com.redstone.ota.ui

229
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:41,839
detected as i think guerrilla and then

230
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:44,000
here is an example of news in 2018

231
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,640
pre-infected malware on white labeled

232
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:49,360
phone the idea of from switching 3g to

233
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,120
4g is

234
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,279
attracting attracted a lot of consumers

235
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:55,200
to buy this phone you can think of white

236
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,760
labeled phone as um

237
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:01,040
being manufactured or sell sold by

238
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,880
retailers with their own branding and

239
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,959
logos but the manufacturer is from third

240
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:08,800
party so what happened here they able to

241
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:11,440
retrieve uh personal information mobile

242
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,399
numbers

243
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:14,959
and created lots of gaming accounts

244
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:17,760
gaming here refers to gambling account

245
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:20,320
well actually um

246
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,680
for gambling companies they would

247
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,920
normally give you bonus money so they

248
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,839
were able to monetize on this one and

249
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:27,839
also to emphasize that

250
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:28,640
the

251
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,000
what they call this

252
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,320
they have to check the manufacturer and

253
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,720
telecoms in that country

254
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,640
and also to

255
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,959
find the national information security

256
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:41,279
standards is being met

257
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:43,640
this lastly is the case of

258
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:45,279
non-smartphone

259
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:47,519
um pre-installed with malware so just

260
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:50,160
the basic functionality sms

261
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:52,560
the police found the main board is

262
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,800
sending and receiving sms and send

263
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,640
uploading it to the server

264
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,880
and so they estimated 5 million infected

265
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:02,080
devices 50 million stolen pii 14

266
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:04,480
individuals who actually sold

267
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:08,000
uh bought the p a stolen pai

268
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
they actually arrested the developer

269
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,080
they arrested the manufacturer

270
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:15,120
in of the main board in shenzhen china

271
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,720
and

272
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:19,200
yeah pulling the wool means um something

273
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,680
like the sms selling fraud

274
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:22,720
um

275
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:25,839
out of the sign in bonuses

276
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:29,040
right so sms verification according to

277
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,519
freebuff a community of security

278
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:35,200
security enthusiasts in china um

279
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,360
they they were saying that the birth of

280
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,360
sms verification was in 2004 when people

281
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:42,000
wanted to solve the issue on identifying

282
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,399
real identity and real names

283
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:46,880
and so the binding of sms verification

284
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:49,360
to human is made use of phone sim card

285
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,040
and the human operating it

286
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,800
and in 2010 the banks were the first one

287
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,880
to operate you know the verification

288
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:58,240
code although it's costly like 5 cents

289
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,160
to 10 sets of sms still it's very

290
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:03,680
effective in protecting the accounts and

291
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:04,640
secure

292
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:08,000
system and so the internet companies can

293
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,560
complete their kyc or know your customer

294
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,000
and also monitor the behavior of the

295
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,040
device

296
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:15,920
now the sim banks or simbox is a device

297
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:19,120
to aggregate or read sim cards

298
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:22,079
so connecting by a gsm gateway through

299
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:24,320
ib address to allow communication so

300
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,839
this is heavily used by the sms pva

301
00:11:26,839 --> 00:11:30,160
companies so some operators because this

302
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:32,800
is costly and you know maintenance is

303
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:33,920
difficult

304
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:36,640
so some operators found a clever way to

305
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,720
generate more numbers and it's out of

306
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:41,440
the bot that they're operating

307
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:44,320
here they boasted about like thousands

308
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,480
of mobile numbers

309
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:49,360
high availability and i think

310
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:53,360
all numbers in almost all countries

311
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:56,880
so we have encountered this in facebook

312
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:59,200
page named receive code free sms

313
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:02,000
verification goals so if you are looking

314
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,839
for free virtual numbers you would be

315
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:06,639
enticed to try it but there is a hidden

316
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:08,839
magic behind it and

317
00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:11,839
so um yeah like it offers like a

318
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:13,920
thousands of numbers in a single day in

319
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,680
a single country you would think that

320
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:18,800
they have this big sim box but for free

321
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:19,680
really

322
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:20,639
so

323
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:22,800
in that facebook page is also the lemon

324
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:25,200
sms pva but this time with a fee you can

325
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,600
top up your credit to use the service so

326
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,560
it was advertised in 2018 in youtube and

327
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:33,120
in that facebook page is in 2020.

328
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:36,240
um yeah that's topping up the credits

329
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,600
in terms of

330
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:38,800
api

331
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,480
it's actually

332
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,959
indicating that you can automate

333
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:45,200
creating bulk accounts that's perfect

334
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,360
for cyber criminals right so whether api

335
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:50,000
or ui the feature is you can request

336
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,399
number you can rent it for about five

337
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:54,320
minutes then you have to release it so

338
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:56,079
others can use it

339
00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:58,079
actually you can

340
00:12:58,079 --> 00:12:59,600
select country

341
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:00,399
then

342
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:02,639
these are the platforms well you can

343
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:04,160
also block place the number in case you

344
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,320
don't receive otp or probably the owner

345
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,720
of the device already found a compromise

346
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,720
these are the platforms almost all

347
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,320
platforms are available you name it the

348
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:16,160
whatsapp twitter that uses the sms

349
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:17,519
you can actually

350
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:19,920
include another project if there's a new

351
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:22,800
sms but overall the goal is to get the

352
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:25,519
otp code

353
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:26,800
let's say

354
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:27,920
lemon

355
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:30,560
customers they would use proxy because

356
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,560
some platforms they use geographical

357
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:35,040
location the phone number country should

358
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,560
be matching before you can create an

359
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:37,760
account

360
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:39,440
and we believe

361
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:42,240
they have operating this dove proxy and

362
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,639
we believe that the ib plug-in

363
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:46,720
linked to this

364
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,959
is connecting to the cnc server and we

365
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:51,360
believe that the residential proxy

366
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:54,240
originates from devices coming from

367
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,800
connecting to wi-fi and the mobile proxy

368
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:59,279
originates from devices connecting to

369
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:01,519
mobile data so this is a security

370
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:04,560
implication in authentication of sms and

371
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,399
it enables cyber criminals to create

372
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:08,320
bulk accounts without worrying the

373
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,079
location

374
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:11,440
while um

375
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,519
you know exploring their official

376
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:14,560
website

377
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,720
we found a replica website under the dot

378
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,079
c and domain

379
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:19,839
and so

380
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:22,079
um this is an important pivoting point

381
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:24,079
because we were able it led us to

382
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:26,959
several guerrilla malware and

383
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:28,399
did that

384
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:30,000
we think it's staging because it has

385
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,040
lesser traffic

386
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:35,199
well the dex file

387
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:38,320
main functionality is to intercept sms

388
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,399
okay this is the plugable app designs of

389
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:42,480
lemon sorry design

390
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,639
in fact device um activating

391
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:47,360
pre-installed loader connecting to cnc

392
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,040
server and then that scene server will

393
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,399
request for some commands from the back

394
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:53,279
end and then the back end will um digest

395
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:55,519
all this uh the data from the fields to

396
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:57,519
wrap it up and then create a plugin and

397
00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:00,079
then send it to the device well the

398
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:02,079
zygote is an android process being

399
00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:05,120
exploited here zygote will request for

400
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,959
this um

401
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:08,639
data fields to the back end and then the

402
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:10,560
back end will wrap it up to create an

403
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:12,880
encrypted plugin that encrypted plugin

404
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:15,120
will be hosted in the url of the lemon

405
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17,360
will be pushed to the device to install

406
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,079
it

407
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:20,880
and an example of it is let's say sms

408
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,880
plugin hooking to the device for

409
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:26,079
intercepting the sms and so we found the

410
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:27,920
main plug-in

411
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:31,760
responsible for the main execution flow

412
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:33,680
proxy plug-in um

413
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:36,079
used to open proxy server

414
00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:38,320
service rather in sucks 5

415
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:42,800
like retrieving ib address port token

416
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:45,360
and let's say the time out because

417
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:48,079
that's the time when they want to set a

418
00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:50,240
connection to the infected device they

419
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,880
get this they call the cnc server to

420
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:56,320
open proxy connection

421
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,639
now the sms plugin has three main

422
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:00,240
functions

423
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:03,759
it intercepts the sms using start hook

424
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:06,240
or using the ams or activity manager

425
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:07,279
service

426
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:09,360
they can also retrieve regular

427
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:12,399
expression rules from the cnc server

428
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:15,040
which they can use to filter out sms

429
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:17,759
content and lastly is they can send the

430
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:19,839
sms to the back end using that regular

431
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:20,839
expression

432
00:16:20,839 --> 00:16:24,880
rule and so that's the sms plugin

433
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:27,759
the lemon sms pva and the dove proxy we

434
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:29,600
know they're being advertised both in

435
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,920
that facebook page and it led us a

436
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:34,800
company in heinen province in china and

437
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:37,199
the lemon sms pva will offer numbers in

438
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:38,320
different countries and different

439
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,560
platforms and then the proxy will offer

440
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,880
different ip addresses available for

441
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:45,680
example bangladesh has around 122

442
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:48,560
thousands of ib addresses

443
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:51,279
okay sms pva and sms interception how

444
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:53,440
does it work hand in hand let's say a

445
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:55,680
customer will register in lemon

446
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:57,680
register the number of course you need

447
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:59,360
to top up to use the service and then

448
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:02,160
let's say uh select for a project named

449
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:03,279
carousel

450
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:05,599
carson is you know

451
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:09,520
popular marketplace in southeast asia

452
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:10,400
so

453
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:13,520
in that in carsol app he would register

454
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:14,959
and when it comes to phone number he

455
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:16,640
will switch back to lemon to get the

456
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,319
number

457
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:20,640
actually they can also request for the

458
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,079
specific country let's say singapore and

459
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:23,439
then they could put it here and then

460
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:26,240
click verify it will send sms code

461
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:27,919
verification code to the infected device

462
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:30,880
and that device will

463
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,320
be called by the lemon using the

464
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:34,320
guerrilla malware and then the the lemon

465
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:35,440
will

466
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:37,280
return the otp code to the customer of

467
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:38,400
lemon

468
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:41,200
and it's successfully created when i

469
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:44,799
um the castle account because of the odp

470
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:46,880
in the background the sms plugin

471
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,960
actually intercept the sms

472
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:51,120
calls the css server for regular

473
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:53,120
expression rule let's say the condition

474
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:56,720
here is carousel text with four digit

475
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:59,760
and so it will be sent to the server

476
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:02,480
it's also not being visible to customer

477
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:05,600
because the guerrilla has capability of

478
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:08,080
preventing the broadcasting of the sms

479
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:11,200
and it happens in an infected phone

480
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,760
right so we emphasize the different

481
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:16,000
persistence mechanism of mobile supply

482
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:16,880
chain

483
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,799
before bad apps they can download root

484
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:21,200
exploits and rooted phone can be

485
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,440
installed back door for persistence but

486
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:26,080
here first roam image

487
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:27,919
being compromised or tampered as i

488
00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:30,640
mentioned earlier guerrilla or triada

489
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:33,200
embedding without notifying the oem

490
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,520
second is photo auto update server

491
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,840
either photo auto update has malicious

492
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:40,160
loader or photo auto has

493
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:43,520
pre-infected rome image example are

494
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:46,559
redstone adopts they are ota supplier in

495
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:49,280
china and they

496
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:50,960
manufacturing are also based in china

497
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:52,320
actually and

498
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:55,600
last is a software sdk example is an apk

499
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:56,799
pure

500
00:18:56,799 --> 00:18:58,960
it's an alternative to google play and

501
00:18:58,960 --> 00:18:59,919
they were

502
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:02,400
kaspersky mentioned that

503
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:05,440
triad is embedded and so

504
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:06,480
it

505
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:11,280
exploited the zygote um let's say

506
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,799
what i call this

507
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:17,280
yeah um the triada was able to modify

508
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:19,440
the zygote

509
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:20,960
now this is a

510
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:23,840
what he called a sample of forum let's

511
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:26,080
say a user reported about his rom image

512
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:28,080
version 11

513
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:30,799
and he found out that the sms in his

514
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:32,480
phone is being intercepted to this

515
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:33,760
domain name

516
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:35,919
and the rom image actually came from a

517
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:38,240
yandex sharing service and they found

518
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:38,960
out

519
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,720
or they are also reporting or

520
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:43,840
complaining about the infection

521
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:45,679
putting it together to show you the

522
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:47,760
cyber crime business model

523
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,679
we know the angle in mobile supply chain

524
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:52,400
attacks you know became effective and

525
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,880
efficient for cyber criminals

526
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:58,240
um they exploited the zygote because of

527
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:00,799
they created the main plug-in that

528
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:03,679
zygote will

529
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:06,960
install loader connectors in the server

530
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:09,840
retrieve information like imei and then

531
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:11,280
the back end will

532
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:12,559
revert back

533
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:16,320
the plug-in based from the strategy

534
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:18,160
the zygote also

535
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:20,799
able to modify live android which is one

536
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:23,120
of the components of android os

537
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:26,799
um basically it created a routine

538
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:29,760
to write the dot text file to the dalvik

539
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:31,520
cache directory

540
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:33,520
and so these are the plugins the ip

541
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:36,159
proxy plugin for residential and mobile

542
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:38,799
proxy and then sms plugin for sms

543
00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:41,120
interception both are in the infected

544
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:43,760
device and this operation our business

545
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:46,400
was around 2018 the dove proxy and the

546
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:49,760
lam one sms pva service

547
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:50,640
they

548
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:53,440
attracted more customers to create bulk

549
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:54,559
accounts

550
00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:57,679
and that facilitated or end to some scam

551
00:20:57,679 --> 00:21:00,000
or fraud

552
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,520
right

553
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:04,320
we now go for implications uh sms

554
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:06,480
default verification but because they

555
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:09,120
bypass it the search of sms pva service

556
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:10,320
there are some implications like

557
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:12,640
anonymity it's one of the obstacles

558
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:13,919
cyber criminals they would create

559
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:15,360
account

560
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:17,280
that account

561
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:20,000
because of the smsp based service

562
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,039
it's

563
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:23,600
an added arsenal to them coordinated

564
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:26,640
inauthentic behavior

565
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:29,440
it can use to distribute and amplify

566
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:32,480
information often misinformation in

567
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:34,559
social media

568
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:36,720
abusing sign in bonuses and app

569
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,880
gamification bonuses

570
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,720
they would create a lot of accounts

571
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:43,120
based from the phone numbers

572
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:45,440
and so that let's say coupon codes

573
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:47,679
promotional codes they can convert it to

574
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:49,440
the hard cache

575
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,600
and it can also

576
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:53,919
lead to some other scams and fraud like

577
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:56,080
roman scam investment scam

578
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:58,640
i know you can all relate even me i

579
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,799
receive those kind of sms

580
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:04,080
um consumer privacy the infected devices

581
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:06,799
the owner of it is highly impacted their

582
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:08,960
phone numbers may be possibly used by

583
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:12,559
cyber criminal cyber crime and can also

584
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:14,960
be as a monitoring tool now

585
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:17,840
circumvent regional restriction there

586
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:19,520
are some countries like for example

587
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:21,600
banning cryptocurrency exchange

588
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:25,120
platforms so sms pva isn't

589
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:27,760
an option to bypass it

590
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:30,159
this is an ideal example of abusing

591
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:32,159
signing bonus the starbucks in china in

592
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:33,840
2018

593
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:36,080
they launched a promotion of like

594
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:37,840
if you create an account using their app

595
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:39,760
you will receive a free drink for about

596
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:42,000
five dollars to six dollars and so in

597
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,320
the first day of their promotion the

598
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:47,120
cyber criminals were able to create 400

599
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:48,799
thousands of accounts

600
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:52,159
and so the starbucks would um

601
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:54,000
notice those ghost accounts and they

602
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,280
immediately halted their promotion

603
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:59,679
and on the other side you can see the

604
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:00,960
phone numbers

605
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:03,679
generated from the lemon group those

606
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:06,320
numbers using social links we were able

607
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:07,600
to get the

608
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:10,320
social media linkages on a real-time

609
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:11,280
basis

610
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:14,320
two telegram accounts with same photo

611
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:15,919
actually the photo is from an online

612
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:18,640
shopping site so it's a model and one is

613
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,400
in chinese name one is in russian name

614
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,400
definitely this is a fake account we

615
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:25,280
also found numbers linked to

616
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:26,960
let's say the country code matches the

617
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:29,280
social media the nationality but then

618
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,039
there's another account with different

619
00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:34,559
nationalities so that's also a red flag

620
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:38,720
this is a project list of lemon sms.net

621
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:41,600
we can you can find it in their url

622
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:44,400
parameters so we could estimate about

623
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:48,559
thousands of regular expression rule

624
00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:50,960
or the number of target platforms there

625
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,880
are some platforms that are recurring

626
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:55,919
like wechat but i think it's because the

627
00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:58,480
sms if it changed a bit then they will

628
00:23:58,480 --> 00:23:59,600
add

629
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,360
line head highest

630
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:03,120
i would say maybe

631
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:05,760
line is not widely used but any phone

632
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:08,559
numbers can be used to register in line

633
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:10,720
and this is from trend micro telemetry

634
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:13,919
data from october 2010 to 1 to march of

635
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:15,679
2022

636
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:18,559
it's another example of fraud the tingle

637
00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:21,120
it's an e-commerce site

638
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:22,960
they offered

639
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:26,080
gift package and shipping coupons when

640
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:29,520
you register or for the newcomers

641
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:32,080
here using same telemetry data from

642
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:34,159
trend micro thailand had the highest

643
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:36,080
well ting dong is also based in that

644
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:39,120
country perfect for cyber criminals and

645
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:41,600
it could also indicate that

646
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:43,919
there are maybe possibly

647
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:46,720
more infected devices surprisingly the

648
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:49,039
second one is mexico

649
00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:50,559
we know single is not being used in that

650
00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:53,200
country and the user of

651
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,960
in that country would not notice the

652
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:57,360
fraud because they don't know this app

653
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:59,600
and that's how the cyber criminals take

654
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:02,480
advantage of it

655
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,640
these are the phone numbers generated by

656
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:07,679
lemon for otp requests still from trial

657
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:09,200
micro data

658
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:11,039
the southeast asia

659
00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:13,679
countries and india had

660
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:15,600
highly impacted

661
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:18,159
we could say that these countries are

662
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:19,840
possibly

663
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:21,279
impacted with the mobile supply chain

664
00:25:21,279 --> 00:25:23,279
attacks or that some countries are

665
00:25:23,279 --> 00:25:26,880
lenient in provisioning sim cards

666
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:30,400
this is an example of um

667
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,159
examination from police

668
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:34,720
in shouting um internet police

669
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:37,120
discovered that

670
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:39,600
the fraudsters are exploiting the

671
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:41,679
loophole in online e-commerce platforms

672
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:42,799
like

673
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:46,320
taobao jingdong and to-in so an example

674
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:49,360
is the tingdom

675
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:52,000
they bypass their real name verification

676
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,440
in that case

677
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:57,039
uh they were able to buy phone numbers

678
00:25:57,039 --> 00:25:59,279
and real names from what we called card

679
00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:02,240
holders so that is someone who owns a

680
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:04,159
lot of sim cards

681
00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:06,720
and that's from the examination and why

682
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,880
a lot of devices here

683
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:11,200
of course for creating bulk accounts i

684
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:12,960
think for example in whatsapp you can

685
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:15,440
create account without phone number

686
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,840
like using the api but it has a high

687
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:20,799
tendency to be disabled because of that

688
00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:23,279
so that's why there's a lot of phone

689
00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:26,400
right um as i mentioned earlier you can

690
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:29,120
top up service credit using their

691
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:30,880
cryptocurrency wallets so we were able

692
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:33,919
to trace it tron wallet uh had like

693
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:36,080
thirteen thousands of detections

694
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:37,120
sorry

695
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:38,400
transactions

696
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:39,360
and

697
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:40,640
from that

698
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:43,520
we could estimate like let's say once a

699
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:45,279
month you have to top up your credit so

700
00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:48,080
we could estimate about 2 000 of

701
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:50,720
customer but they also have other

702
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:52,640
wallet like bitcoin

703
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:55,440
so we could sum it up to around 660

704
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:57,600
thousands of u.s dollars but there's

705
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:01,120
also like the alipay and others

706
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:03,760
country statistics-wise lemon

707
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:06,240
provides daily numbers available phone

708
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:09,520
numbers like in their free received code

709
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:12,080
and the lemon official

710
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:14,480
you can see the commonalities right

711
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:17,039
mostly southeast asian countries and it

712
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:19,600
also matches with telemetry data like we

713
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:22,480
found indonesia and thailand with highly

714
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:24,799
or most attempts of let's say mobile

715
00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:27,039
supply chain or gorilla in that in those

716
00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:28,799
devices

717
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:30,000
we also

718
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,440
found the affected devices

719
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:35,600
in our research paper we

720
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:38,000
put some of the phone brands and models

721
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,559
but this is only to say that they're

722
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:42,080
mostly

723
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:43,840
attempts of mobile supply chain attack

724
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:46,080
and guerrilla malware and we found that

725
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:47,760
of course the main

726
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:50,880
targets are the low-cost mobile

727
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:53,039
phones

728
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:55,679
right so we come up with the conclusion

729
00:27:55,679 --> 00:27:57,840
so we have seen the evolution of mobile

730
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:59,679
supply chain attacks and

731
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:02,480
it still happens to some of the oem

732
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:04,080
companies

733
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:06,720
we emphasize the different persistence

734
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:08,480
mechanism

735
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:11,600
compromising or tampering the rom image

736
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:13,919
photo of the update server and the

737
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:16,640
software sdk

738
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:18,480
here

739
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:20,320
we can given the recommendation for the

740
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:22,000
oem let's say

741
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,320
to know their vendors

742
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:26,799
to establish assurance by performing

743
00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:29,360
strong evaluation on the apps

744
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:30,559
especially

745
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:32,880
sorry on the image especially on the

746
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:34,880
loaders embedded

747
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:37,440
anonymity is the main what they call

748
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:40,000
this opsec of cyber criminals they could

749
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
create because of the this sms pva

750
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,960
service it spices up their arsenal

751
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:48,159
and the implication on security

752
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:51,760
uh authentication of sms

753
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:53,600
is also

754
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:55,919
saying that

755
00:28:55,919 --> 00:28:59,200
this is uh let's say

756
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:00,080
the

757
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:01,919
what he calls a million of devices could

758
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:05,919
be possibly impacted because of this

759
00:29:05,919 --> 00:29:08,320
and this

760
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:10,720
evolving cyber crime business model

761
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:12,559
from click fraud to pre-installed

762
00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:15,200
malware or the silent loader

763
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:17,200
is becoming uh

764
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:19,520
what i call this

765
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:22,240
uh let the cyber criminals to

766
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:24,720
thrive to survive because of their

767
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:27,279
persistence mechanism and it can also

768
00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:29,600
lead to data exploration

769
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:32,159
uh to identity theft when they um let's

770
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:34,799
say hijack authentication cookies

771
00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:35,760
um

772
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:37,600
so they can impersonate and hide their

773
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:40,960
identity and that's silent loader

774
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:44,480
i skip on the security model i would say

775
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:47,070
i was trying to say that

776
00:29:47,070 --> 00:29:48,880
[Music]

777
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:52,159
okay they are trying to exploit the

778
00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:53,760
behavior-based security model for

779
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:54,399
example

780
00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:57,039
there's a social media has been active

781
00:29:57,039 --> 00:29:59,919
for several years and that

782
00:29:59,919 --> 00:30:01,520
suddenly a new account is linked because

783
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:02,799
of same number

784
00:30:02,799 --> 00:30:06,080
so that new account is preferred over

785
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:08,960
anonymous or random account

786
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:11,760
and if that new account is used by cyber

787
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:13,840
criminals it can baffle police

788
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:15,279
investigation

789
00:30:15,279 --> 00:30:17,840
identity uh challenge in identifying the

790
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:19,440
real identities

791
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:21,520
and adding confidence to cyber criminals

792
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:23,200
because they can minimize their online

793
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:26,799
footprints they're abusing it so

794
00:30:26,799 --> 00:30:27,840
with that

795
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:30,720
phone is becoming our real identity

796
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:33,279
however there are still some caveats and

797
00:30:33,279 --> 00:30:36,000
it continues to reshape the threat

798
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,880
landscape and security model

799
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:40,000
and so

800
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,880
we have here some counter measures

801
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:45,360
that we mentioned for online platform

802
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:47,200
services

803
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:49,120
use of one-time sms is not enough

804
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:51,200
anymore

805
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:53,679
be cautious when launching sign in

806
00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:56,159
and for smartphone vendors

807
00:30:56,159 --> 00:30:58,480
ensure provenance

808
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:00,480
trust to the third party vendors for

809
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:03,120
consumers always consider cons security

810
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:04,399
when purchasing

811
00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:06,640
phones so i don't have to delve

812
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:09,760
or mention one by one this is available

813
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:12,240
in our research paper published in

814
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:13,360
february

815
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:15,520
so you can visit trendmicro.com

816
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:18,320
for that and i think that's all for my

817
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:20,320
presentation for today and

818
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:22,320
yeah we are now open for question and

819
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:26,080
answer and my co-speakers zhangyu and

820
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:28,880
vladimir is on the line can also answer

821
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:30,640
your questions

822
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:31,760
so yeah

823
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:34,559
any question guys

824
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:36,399
all right um there's a question from the

825
00:31:36,399 --> 00:31:37,840
virtual audience

826
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:39,919
how could a consumer protect ourselves

827
00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:42,240
with these evolving cyber crimes related

828
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:44,559
to sms

829
00:31:44,559 --> 00:31:46,799
how this cyber can you repeat again

830
00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:49,039
sorry how could a consumer protect

831
00:31:49,039 --> 00:31:50,880
ourselves with this evolving cyber

832
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:53,679
crimes related to sms

833
00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:55,440
right first of all is of course you need

834
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:56,559
to install

835
00:31:56,559 --> 00:31:59,039
security software in your mobile phone

836
00:31:59,039 --> 00:32:00,990
and second is to

837
00:32:00,990 --> 00:32:02,480
[Music]

838
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:05,360
well it's a challenge but they have to

839
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:07,840
carefully check their phone number is

840
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:09,200
connected to

841
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:12,159
uh only to those social media social

842
00:32:12,159 --> 00:32:14,960
medias that they have and

843
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:17,440
and to say that the phone

844
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:19,840
that is usually infected from mobile

845
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:22,240
supply chain attacks are low cost mobile

846
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:24,080
i'm not saying that don't use low cost

847
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:26,799
mobile phones but there are some

848
00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:28,559
well as reported

849
00:32:28,559 --> 00:32:30,720
from the news they are highly targeted

850
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:33,600
because of the i think maybe poor

851
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:34,480
um

852
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:37,519
implementation of security mechanisms so

853
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:41,600
um yeah um always secure your device be

854
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:43,440
wary also of

855
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:45,039
i'm not sure if chrome images is

856
00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:46,720
