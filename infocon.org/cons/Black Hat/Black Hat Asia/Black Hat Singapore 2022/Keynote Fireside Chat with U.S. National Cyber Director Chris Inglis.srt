00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:04,810
[Music]

2
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:09,760
i'm jeff moss this is chris inglis and

3
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:12,559
we're going to be having a fireside chat

4
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:14,880
with no fire

5
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:18,160
yeah there's building codes um

6
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:20,160
so the idea is we're just gonna i've got

7
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,279
some ideas to talk about here um i'll

8
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:25,359
tee up some ideas some questions

9
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:26,640
and we really get a chance to kind of

10
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:28,560
look into the thinking that chris has

11
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:29,760
the way he's approaching some of the

12
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,599
issues and hopefully it'll give us a

13
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:33,840
little bit of a perspective of of where

14
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,680
we're going

15
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:37,840
you sound good sounds perfect sounds

16
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:39,840
good okay i could just begin by saying

17
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,280
thanks for the opportunity to be here i

18
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,120
know that we're all desiring to get back

19
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:44,879
out again and meet our fellow fellow

20
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:45,840
person

21
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,320
um i used to joke that since i worked at

22
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:50,079
nsa for so long it took me years to

23
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:52,079
speak in the presence of natural light

24
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:53,440
are we all learning to speak in the

25
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:55,280
presence of each other this is terrific

26
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:56,800
that we've got this physical joint i

27
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:57,840
know there are a lot of people that are

28
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:59,920
virtually joining but it's high time we

29
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:01,520
got back together again and influenced

30
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:02,879
one another yeah that's right i think

31
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:04,799
the first time i actually met you you

32
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:06,720
were at the agency that's true and it

33
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,720
was right around the snowden excitement

34
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:12,159
that's true yeah that was that's a word

35
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:14,080
excitement

36
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:15,439
so um

37
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:16,400
in

38
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,080
in the previous discussion starting with

39
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,000
the keynote and otherwise

40
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,720
we've been talking a lot about um

41
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:24,080
the role of people

42
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:25,280
in cyber states there's a lot of

43
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,439
technology but this people um is the

44
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:29,360
core we're doing this technology for

45
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:32,000
people and the role of civil society in

46
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,159
a lot of these areas the infrastructure

47
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:35,920
the people who are writing the code are

48
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,759
generally private citizens the companies

49
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:39,119
private companies

50
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:42,079
and so a lot of it is civil society and

51
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:43,759
when i was at icann one of the things we

52
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:45,119
had there as a civil society

53
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:46,320
organization was this thing called the

54
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:49,200
ppp the public-private partnership

55
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,479
um or a public policy proposal right

56
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:54,960
they had con

57
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,960
collisions on their acronyms

58
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,000
and

59
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
same thing dhs public-private

60
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,840
partnerships now we're hearing about it

61
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:04,320
again and

62
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,119
its

63
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:06,560
track record of success is a little

64
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,080
rocky but one of the things we're

65
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,758
hearing now in today's internet

66
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:11,840
environment is

67
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,680
in china you see this forced

68
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,280
public-private partnership where

69
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:18,000
companies are mandated by law to support

70
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,720
the national government in china in the

71
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:21,520
west

72
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,879
we're talking about a strategic

73
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:24,800
public-private partnership but it's of

74
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,239
the willing

75
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:28,319
so maybe you can contrast those two

76
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:30,160
models and talk about

77
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,400
in a in a free and open society what is

78
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,640
a strategic public-private partnership

79
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,400
mean in cyber which is essentially a

80
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,720
dual use technology

81
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,640
you've almost answered the question

82
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:43,200
but i love the question i would say that

83
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,760
there are many versions of how one party

84
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,360
can deal with another one organization

85
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,959
deals with another one person deals with

86
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:51,040
another and i'll just roll through what

87
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,640
they aren't and get to where you want me

88
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:53,599
to be

89
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:55,120
first you can essentially say we're

90
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,560
going to have a relationship let's do

91
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,959
that essentially by deconfliction you do

92
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:00,560
what you do i'll do what i do and if we

93
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,840
bump into each other in the middle of

94
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,360
the night we'll figure out why we'll

95
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,280
pick each other up dust each other off

96
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,040
move back in our respective directions

97
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,959
that's not collaboration it's not a

98
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:11,519
partnership the second is a division of

99
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:13,440
effort where you essentially say you do

100
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,280
a i will do b

101
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,200
will presume that there's this clean

102
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,720
scene between us

103
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,159
that's action agreement to not

104
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:22,000
collaborate that's not a partnership

105
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,840
that's just an arrangement

106
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:26,480
and oftentimes we try to substitute that

107
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,159
for collaboration in this space only

108
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:30,560
finding out that what one side knows or

109
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,480
the other side knows isn't enough to

110
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,080
actually figure out what together they

111
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,599
could know it's sort of like they're

112
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:36,799
next to each other but they're not

113
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:38,560
actually yes they actually agreed not to

114
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,680
collaborate

115
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,840
and what i think i have found in my role

116
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,519
in my government role at the moment but

117
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:45,200
with some private sector

118
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,440
experience behind me is that we often

119
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,200
overestimate what a government would

120
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,879
know underestimate what the private

121
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:52,799
sector knows and ignored our peril what

122
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:55,040
we could know together so the reasons

123
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,640
those efforts that you've described

124
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,560
earlier did not work is because they

125
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,319
were an approximation of one or more of

126
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:02,159
those or they might in fact be something

127
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:04,159
worse which is an attempt to subordinate

128
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:06,319
one of those partners to another that

129
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:08,000
doesn't work cyberspace is not a

130
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,840
hierarchical proposition so we're

131
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,519
looking for something more than pooling

132
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:13,280
information we're looking for more than

133
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,200
sharing information we're looking for a

134
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,798
degree of professional intimacy such

135
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:18,478
that we can discover things together

136
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:20,160
that no one of us could have discovered

137
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,560
alone that we take a shard or a shred or

138
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,639
a hunch in one side or the other compare

139
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:26,880
that to something that is kind of

140
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:30,080
unknown unanalyzed on the other side and

141
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,919
again discover something no one could

142
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:33,919
have discovered alone um our british

143
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:35,280
counterparts have done that something

144
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,800
called the national cyber security

145
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,400
center it's working our israeli

146
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,840
counterparts have done that we in the

147
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:42,160
united states are attempting to do that

148
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,080
over at our cyber security and

149
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:46,080
infrastructure security agency

150
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,840
something called the joint cyber defense

151
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,440
collaborative forget the acronym

152
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,360
remember the concept it's beginning to

153
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,680
work it's noisy perhaps there might be

154
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,759
on day on some days too many parties on

155
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:57,360
that floor but we're beginning to

156
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,440
discover things in the bowels of those

157
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:02,080
relationships that ultimately profit as

158
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,919
you kind of push that up become

159
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:05,600
actionable information so that you can

160
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,800
take that off that floor and do

161
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,080
something about it i think that's

162
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,800
partnership and that can work i think i

163
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,400
think the criticisms in the past were

164
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,320
mostly law enforcement would come to the

165
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,080
private sector tell us

166
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,080
ask us give us everything you know

167
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,440
okay and you turn it over and then you

168
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,440
never hear from them again and so it was

169
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,199
you want to support but you never got

170
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:24,800
feedback so you never understood if what

171
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:27,120
you were doing was useful so that would

172
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,120
suggest that this private pvp would

173
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,919
require some sort of feedback

174
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:33,600
well i would say that collaboration is

175
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,960
what we're really talking about here is

176
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,720
generally built on several kind of

177
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,479
attributes one is you need to have a

178
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:41,039
common objective common cause right and

179
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:43,120
in the realm of cyberspace we get that

180
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,600
in spades right there is a common set of

181
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,400
infrastructure elements that we conduct

182
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,960
our personal business our business our

183
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:53,919
societal aspirations on and that's a

184
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:55,840
shared asset it therefore requires

185
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,919
collaboration to defend too

186
00:05:57,919 --> 00:05:59,600
you need professional intimacy and by

187
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,360
that i mean you need to be close enough

188
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,520
to one another that if you're asking the

189
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,199
wrong question or offering the wrong

190
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:06,400
information

191
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,080
one of the other parties can see through

192
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,919
that and say look i i see that you have

193
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:11,759
something that is actually valuable to

194
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:13,280
me it's the other half of what i've been

195
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,360
missing you don't get that by playing

196
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,199
what the americans call the game of go

197
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:19,440
fish where you ask whether somebody has

198
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,360
a certain kind of card you ask if

199
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,800
somebody has the answer to a certain

200
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,800
question you're probably asking the

201
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,560
wrong questions you might be offered the

202
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,400
wrong information you need to get close

203
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,080
enough where you can actually see across

204
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,919
the hedgerows and then finally you need

205
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:33,199
infrastructure you need to have the

206
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:35,039
means by which you can conduct that

207
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:37,120
exchange and so we've established the

208
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,720
infrastructure we're driving for that

209
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,880
culture we're driving for a partnership

210
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,639
that's collaborative not a division of

211
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:45,600
effort so you um you recently had an

212
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,840
article published in foreign affairs

213
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:50,000
talking about the the sort of the need

214
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,720
for a new social contract in cyberspace

215
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,240
um maybe you talk about that a little

216
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,000
bit to give people some perspective

217
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
haven't seen it and uh and it sounded

218
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,280
like you're sort of trying to

219
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:04,160
apply or redistribute the accountability

220
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,800
and the responsibilities in this sort of

221
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,240
shared

222
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,240
environment yeah so thanks for asking

223
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,639
about it harry kresha kind of a member

224
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:14,880
of my office whose work strategy both at

225
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,400
the u.s department of defense and now

226
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,440
with us

227
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,840
um and me we wrote this article and it

228
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:22,400
does call for a new social contract but

229
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,160
it's not new and novel it might be new

230
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,400
and novel as it's applied to cyberspace

231
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,560
but we've done this before essentially

232
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:31,360
what it calls out for is an allocation

233
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,440
of responsibility across the entire

234
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,880
ecosystem

235
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:37,360
to kind of ensure that every one of us

236
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,720
whether we're an individual or an

237
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,639
organization or a government is

238
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:43,280
participating in some way shape or form

239
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,960
in investing in the resilience of that

240
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:48,000
space and then in defending what results

241
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,400
today however what we have is too often

242
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,240
that poor soul who's at the end of the

243
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,599
supply chain

244
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:55,599
who inherits all of the risk that no one

245
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:57,759
else has bought down and is then

246
00:07:57,759 --> 00:07:59,759
toe-to-toe kind of face-to-face with

247
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:02,800
some adversary whether that's nature or

248
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,879
a nation-state toe-to-toe and finds

249
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:07,199
themselves unable to prevail we need to

250
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:08,960
do what we've done in the automobile

251
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,960
industry the aviation industry other

252
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:13,199
industries where we build these systems

253
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:15,599
to be resilient by design we build the

254
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:17,280
systems within which they operate road

255
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,360
systems or air traffic systems to be

256
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,680
essentially safe such that they have the

257
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,120
properties necessary that you can

258
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:25,199
navigate your way from place a to place

259
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:27,360
b fully confident that there aren't

260
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,599
sharp edges or kind of jagged kind of

261
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:32,000
things in that space and then finally we

262
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,279
need to make sure that we all

263
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:35,279
participate in the defense so that if

264
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:37,039
you're a transgressor in that space you

265
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:38,559
got to beat everybody to be one of us

266
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:40,399
you can't pick us off one at a time but

267
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:41,760
there's um

268
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:44,000
there's a unique property in in the

269
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,279
internet which is

270
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:46,640
um

271
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,480
when it comes to defense those closest

272
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,560
to the levers of control

273
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,959
um are usually the only ones that can

274
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:54,480
effectuate the defense

275
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,240
so we can patch

276
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,760
if microsoft releases a patch we can

277
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,120
apply the patch if they don't release a

278
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,560
patch

279
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,160
we're kind of in trouble and so that

280
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:04,640
would suggest to me that microsoft or

281
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,880
anyway apple and anybody

282
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,360
has a greater responsibility they're

283
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:12,480
closer to the ultimate fix so does that

284
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,640
mean they have a greater responsibility

285
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,560
yeah i think so taking microsoft out of

286
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,160
it and just substituting the general

287
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,519
kind of party

288
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:21,680
or automobiles we expect automobile

289
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:24,080
manufacturers to build safe cars we

290
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:26,399
expect them to install air safety bags

291
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:29,120
we install them to install analog brakes

292
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:31,680
we expect that when a user buys a piece

293
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:34,000
of that commodity chain an automobile or

294
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,320
a truck that it comes with all that

295
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,240
built in that's a burden that needs to

296
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,560
be born in the capital expenditure phase

297
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,959
not merely in the operational phase we

298
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:44,720
have found ourselves because we haven't

299
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,560
been doing that responding to two three

300
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:49,440
alarm fires time after time that's no

301
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,680
way to defend this enterprise especially

302
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,519
when so much of a critical nature

303
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:55,760
depends upon it more than our individual

304
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,839
aspirations societal aspirations and

305
00:09:57,839 --> 00:09:59,360
critical functions depend upon the

306
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,120
resilience of this space we need to

307
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:03,600
treat it as such so

308
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,440
to me that sounds like more regulation

309
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:08,800
is coming or is it more self-regulation

310
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:09,680
or

311
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:10,480
since

312
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:13,680
since a lot of this is global in nature

313
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,200
we could fix everything to a perfect

314
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,880
degree in the united states but we're

315
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,399
still at risk because other countries

316
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:20,000
are building technology that we consume

317
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
and use so it's really about what

318
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,839
coalition or trying to build and

319
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:26,959
convince others to follow this model or

320
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:29,200
how do you a great point so let me tease

321
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,320
out i think all the things you've

322
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,440
discussed first of all i don't think

323
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,279
we're going to make anything perfect at

324
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:35,440
best we're going to create a defensible

325
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,440
system which then must be defended so we

326
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,600
have to think about both parts how do we

327
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,440
build the resilience and robustness and

328
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,839
so that it is defensible and then in a

329
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:45,519
collaborative fashion that partnership

330
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:46,880
we talked about earlier how do we then

331
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:49,360
defend it but to your point i think that

332
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:50,880
we're seeing that some degree of

333
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:53,120
self-enlightenment various organizations

334
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,959
individuals are now understanding the

335
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:56,720
risk that comes from not building this

336
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,240
in at the beginning they're taking

337
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,640
action we're seeing market forces stand

338
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:02,640
in where one company competes with

339
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,399
another not merely based upon the

340
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:06,720
performance of the system in terms of

341
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,800
its processing power its bandwidth or

342
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,800
its ability to present things back in a

343
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:13,200
dazzling array but rather on security as

344
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,200
well so market forces have a role to

345
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,360
play but at some point just like we have

346
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,640
in other systems of interest like

347
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:20,480
automobiles and airplanes we're going to

348
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,399
determine that market forces haven't got

349
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:24,640
us far enough and we will with the

350
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:27,279
lightest possible touch nation by nation

351
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:28,680
have to determine what is a

352
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:30,240
non-discretionary feature that's

353
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,360
required

354
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,839
something that we depend on in terms of

355
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:35,680
creating the resilience and robustness

356
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,200
so that the system can deliver the

357
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,800
confidence that we want and the critical

358
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,720
functions that it delivers we won't be

359
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,800
defending cyberspace for its own sake

360
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,079
we'll be defending it so that we can

361
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:45,279
have confidence in the critical

362
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:47,200
functions that rely on it that's why

363
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,959
we'll do this not for regulation's sake

364
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:51,120
not for cybersay but for the critical

365
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,399
function say

366
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:54,959
so that um that's a perfect segue into

367
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:57,600
my next point

368
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,880
and that is

369
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:01,360
a lot of people observed as businesses

370
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:03,360
and governments move to

371
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,600
shared hosting cloud providers whether

372
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,480
you're a

373
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:09,200
state local tribe territory

374
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,440
you can't afford your own private uh

375
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,959
your own private cloud instance you're

376
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:15,120
on a shared environment well now you're

377
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,480
you're in a multi-tenant cloud

378
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:17,519
environment

379
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:19,920
and the cloud provider

380
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:22,320
gets to inherit your risk

381
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,480
so your threat model as a nation state

382
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,800
or as a government is now has to be

383
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,480
assumed by the cloud provider just like

384
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,560
they're assuming the net risk models of

385
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,480
all their customers

386
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,880
but in this dual use kind of environment

387
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:38,240
i'm curious how

388
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:39,760
it's one thing if a

389
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,040
if the cloud provider is defending

390
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:43,120
against criminals but it's different if

391
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,639
they're defending against another

392
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:46,880
foreign nation state that's coming after

393
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:49,839
government so in that situation

394
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:51,519
is there a role what is the role of

395
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:53,519
government or is that purely

396
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:55,760
um when the cloud provider gets attacked

397
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:58,240
by some third-party country

398
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,600
like they're like is this what they

399
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:00,800
signed up for

400
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,399
but you this is the only game in town

401
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:03,920
because everything's dual use and i'm

402
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:05,600
just curious where are those those where

403
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,839
does the ic or the intelligence or the

404
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:10,399
military versus law enforcement

405
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:12,000
yeah so let me cover that from two

406
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,399
dimensions one in terms of the defensive

407
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:17,040
proposition who should defound a shared

408
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:19,040
architecture shared kind of artifact

409
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:21,600
like the cloud that's got to be and

410
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,360
again we've argued this in our article

411
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,360
calling for a new social contract the

412
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,800
shared work of all of those who

413
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:29,760
participate in that ecosystem so

414
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:31,839
individuals have a role organizations

415
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:33,600
have a role organizations who don't

416
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,760
simply populate it that that with data

417
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,519
but organizations who build and deliver

418
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:39,519
the services we need to understand what

419
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:41,279
each of their roles are and governments

420
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:42,800
have a role to support the private

421
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:45,279
sector in creating institutions and

422
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:47,600
norms and behaviors that then can play

423
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,440
out so that they meet the expectations

424
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,839
of their citizens that's the shared work

425
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:53,920
of all of those parties

426
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,920
there's a new social contract emerging

427
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,440
where the private sector is the

428
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,279
supported organization and governments

429
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:01,279
are the supporting organization

430
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:02,959
governments can provide intelligence

431
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:04,320
about what the nature of threat looks

432
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,079
like in this space or threat actors in

433
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:08,079
this space government can use its

434
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:11,440
convening power perhaps its powers to

435
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,839
absolve of liability to encourage best

436
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:15,839
practice governments can use their

437
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:17,839
buying power to perhaps encourage the

438
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:20,079
development of practices in that space

439
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:21,519
but at some point the private sector

440
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:23,040
bears a burden as well in terms of

441
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:25,199
investing in resilience and robustness

442
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:27,360
and then in defending what results

443
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,800
you've asked the further question which

444
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,560
is but what if there are some nation

445
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,079
states in the world

446
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:33,920
that would hold that at risk believing

447
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:35,680
that's now a concentrated valuable

448
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,279
resource that they could then hold at

449
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:38,160
risk

450
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:40,880
norms stand in at that point in a

451
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,279
rules-based global world where you want

452
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:45,360
like-minded nations to participate in

453
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,680
understanding what those rules are and

454
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:49,519
propagating those roles into the

455
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:52,480
infrastructures to include the internet

456
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,240
such that we can have confidence we know

457
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,000
what good behavior looks like what

458
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
transgressions look like and we

459
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,639
therefore address those in kind

460
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:02,720
i think that that's important

461
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,320
two weeks ago at the white house 60

462
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,000
nations showed up to sign something

463
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,839
called the declaration for the internet

464
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:10,000
which described the aspirations of those

465
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,880
60 nations for a free open resilient

466
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:15,279
robust internet right now that doesn't

467
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:16,800
begin to talk about all the

468
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,560
manifestations of how you implement that

469
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,079
but that's the right start it's like an

470
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:21,600
expression of

471
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,120
this is the direction they want to go in

472
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,639
these are the beliefs that they want to

473
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:27,279
pursue absolutely and then there are

474
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:29,519
norms published by the united nations

475
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:31,600
global group of experts what six seven

476
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:34,079
years ago which described practices the

477
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:35,680
united states and others represented

478
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:37,839
here have signed up to which is that we

479
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:39,680
don't attack civilian infrastructure we

480
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,440
will not hold at risk critical

481
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,839
infrastructure in various other

482
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:45,279
manifestations of what it means to

483
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:47,600
behave well in cyberspace i think that

484
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,440
then is an obligation on the part of

485
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,199
like-minded governments in a rules-based

486
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:53,040
society a rules-based world to

487
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,959
essentially practice that's a it's a

488
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:57,040
tricky endeavor right with the adversary

489
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,079
is willing to hold your critical

490
00:15:58,079 --> 00:15:59,440
infrastructure at risk but you're not

491
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:02,320
willing to hold theirs

492
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:03,519
yeah so

493
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:05,279
yeah that's the cost of

494
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:07,199
of your belief system

495
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:08,560
how do you

496
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:11,040
how do you um well one of the questions

497
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:13,519
i heard on the lead up to the ukrainian

498
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:16,880
invasion was companies were asking

499
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:18,800
some government they were saying can you

500
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,320
give us a heads up can you let us know

501
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:22,160
when we're supposed to raise our shields

502
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:23,680
if you have intelligence and you say you

503
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:26,079
think that we're going to be attacked

504
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:28,000
you know that better than we do can you

505
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,839
tell us when to hit the red button

506
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:30,720
um

507
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,320
and that was i think really fascinating

508
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,639
i hadn't heard that before of companies

509
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:35,839
reaching out instead of saying companies

510
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:37,360
saying we got this

511
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:38,959
they were saying

512
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:41,839
in that relationship in this new world

513
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:43,519
maybe you can tell us when we should

514
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:45,759
move to code red

515
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:47,759
and to the extent that we've practiced

516
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:49,759
that during this particular crisis right

517
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:51,360
the russian attacks on the ukrainian

518
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,759
land mass and in cyberspace they're kind

519
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:55,360
of prosecuting similar attacks on the

520
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,920
ukrainians we've done that you've seen

521
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:59,839
within the united states but not alone

522
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:01,759
you've seen within the united states

523
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:04,160
this passing of intelligence we had

524
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,919
actionable intelligence we passed that

525
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:07,679
to a number of allies so that we could

526
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:09,280
fully and fairly

527
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:10,959
share what we knew about russian

528
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:13,280
intentions we did that similarly for

529
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,439
those cyber kind of activities that we

530
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:17,280
thought were material again putting that

531
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:18,880
in the hands of the actors the private

532
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,959
sector who would defend but at the end

533
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:22,720
of the day most of that becomes what i

534
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:25,039
would describe as strategic intelligence

535
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:26,720
it can describe the equivalent of a

536
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,960
thunderstorm on the near horizon what

537
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,320
people really need to know if you're

538
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:31,840
going to defend a system is something

539
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:33,280
more specific right where's the

540
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:34,720
lightning going to strike they need

541
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,160
tactical kind of intelligence the

542
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,679
tornado's touching down here that's

543
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:39,280
right and that you're only going to

544
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:41,120
describe and you're going to only

545
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:42,720
discover that in real time if you

546
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,799
actually combine your insights and

547
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:47,760
resources so you discover that together

548
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,520
right at the earliest possible moment so

549
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:51,760
that you can catch it box it evict it on

550
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,840
the rise so we've done that as well

551
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,600
again as i'd indicated earlier following

552
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,520
the model that our british counterparts

553
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:59,440
our israeli counterparts other nations

554
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:01,360
are affecting where you put subject

555
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:02,880
matter experts from the private and

556
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,960
public sector together to say let's

557
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,960
share our insights because we need to be

558
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,039
able to discover this tactical warning

559
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:10,559
as it happens

560
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:11,600
one of the

561
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,039
things i find most promising in the

562
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:15,120
defensive space is since disk is so

563
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,480
cheap now and there's a lot of full

564
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,559
packet capture occurring

565
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:20,240
and logging has gotten so good a lot of

566
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:22,480
times defenders can snatch the tools out

567
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:25,039
of the offensive

568
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:26,799
and create a signature and distribute

569
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:28,640
that upload it to virustotal in 30

570
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,320
minutes or whatever and basically you're

571
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:32,559
trying to take the tools away

572
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:34,480
from the attackers as fast as you can

573
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,240
and once you get it into a system like

574
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,320
virustotal or whatever all of a sudden

575
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:39,520
everybody else on the planet sort of

576
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:41,600
gets an immunization shot well with

577
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,280
apologies to all of the great and noble

578
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:44,880
actors out there who've also done

579
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:46,080
something similar i point to what

580
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:48,320
microsoft did about a month ago

581
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:50,559
where they diagnosed a wiper virus in

582
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:52,799
the ukrainian infrastructure

583
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:54,960
diagnosed that within three hours pushed

584
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,799
out a patch which then affected 400

585
00:18:56,799 --> 00:18:59,520
million endpoints that's not unique but

586
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:01,600
it is special right that is something

587
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,679
that at scope and scale can affect a

588
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:06,160
common defense it's within microsoft's

589
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:08,480
responsibilities or rights to do that

590
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,080
they have the authority to essentially

591
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:12,000
manage and sustain the security

592
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,240
integrity of their devices and for them

593
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:16,480
to stand in and act like that alongside

594
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,160
others who are similarly acting like

595
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:20,480
that begins to create a common defense

596
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:23,440
which i think is to all of our benefit

597
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:25,520
so um so the next thing that i find

598
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:28,160
fascinating is um the the move towards

599
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:30,480
sort of sanctions and more specifically

600
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,000
internet or uh

601
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,640
internet government related governance

602
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:37,039
related sanctions um

603
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:39,200
because it's a fairly new

604
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:42,160
uh phenomena so for example um

605
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:44,080
i

606
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:47,440
nominet in uh in the uk

607
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:49,280
had a conversation with their lawyers

608
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:51,200
and they felt they couldn't legally

609
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:54,080
accept payment for uh registrants on

610
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:56,480
their registrar domain name platform in

611
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,640
russia

612
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,400
and so they basically gave everybody a

613
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,480
warning like we're not process and visa

614
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,480
mastercard they're not processing so you

615
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:06,400
might lose all the domain names you've

616
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,480
ever registered in russia which would

617
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,000
have a secondary weird effect of those

618
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,840
domain names becoming public and a

619
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:13,440
fischer or somebody else might seize

620
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:14,880
them and

621
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,159
and there's all these second and third

622
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:18,240
order effects with the the original

623
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:20,159
intention of the sanction is good or the

624
00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:22,480
confusion around private sectors saying

625
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:23,760
we're not going to risk it we're going

626
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:26,880
to read this in the most strict light

627
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:29,039
as a new tool in sort of the diplomatic

628
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:31,039
tool belt that's below the threshold of

629
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:34,159
war of conflict like how do you see this

630
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:35,600
or other

631
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,679
new tools being developed i won't

632
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:39,679
comment on policy that's being made as

633
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:41,919
we speak but just observe the following

634
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:44,080
which is that as you begin to try to

635
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:45,679
think about how you bring sanctions to

636
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:48,000
bear in cyberspace you need to make sure

637
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,679
you don't conflate geography with

638
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:51,919
cyberspace so what you really want to do

639
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:53,760
is hold vladimir putin at risk you need

640
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:56,240
to make sure that you understand that

641
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:58,640
his ip address or his kind of

642
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:00,559
opportunities in cyberspace need to be

643
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:02,720
distinguished from a broad mass of

644
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:05,840
people who may seem to occupy a russian

645
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:07,919
cyber mass but perhaps transcend those

646
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:09,919
borders we need to be very careful about

647
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:11,679
conflating the two so that we understand

648
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:13,760
what the impact will be in cyberspace

649
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:16,720
not in geographic space yeah and i think

650
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,080
that's the

651
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:19,760
every company that's relating or

652
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:21,120
operating that part of the world is

653
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:22,720
struggling with that what happens if an

654
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:24,880
investor in the isp is a sanctioned

655
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:27,039
individual can you not use the isp

656
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:28,159
anymore

657
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:30,880
um and so it's the the fallout of this

658
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,720
is going to be fascinating and and it's

659
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:34,320
going to be duplicated i think by other

660
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:36,159
governments um

661
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:37,520
and

662
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:39,600
as as we're watching this um sort of

663
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:40,960
from a distance

664
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,240
um

665
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:43,679
companies

666
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:46,000
are also i guess individual actors right

667
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,200
they don't necessarily have to wait for

668
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,559
a government to say you can't do

669
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:49,679
business in

670
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:52,159
in russia or you can't transit traffic

671
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:54,159
companies or individuals can just make

672
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:56,080
these decisions on their own was that

673
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:57,840
sort of a surprising

674
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:59,840
outcome do you think or do you or is

675
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:00,960
that

676
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,799
expected behavior

677
00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:04,799
it is it's a small surprise especially

678
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:07,200
if you kind of 10 15 years ago kind of

679
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,640
saw what the

680
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,480
the division of effort was between the

681
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:12,320
private sector and the public sector in

682
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:14,640
terms of who would govern this space and

683
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,400
who perhaps would allow market forces

684
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:19,120
alone to govern in this space i would

685
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:20,799
say that it's a moment where we should

686
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:23,919
be at once emboldened and cautious

687
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:25,440
emboldened to think that we might all

688
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:27,200
participate in the collective defense

689
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:28,640
using the authorities that are

690
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,640
appropriately granted to us individuals

691
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:33,120
have responsibilities and authorities to

692
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:35,120
change the passwords patch their systems

693
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:37,679
to install whatever mechanisms you want

694
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:39,440
companies have the authority and

695
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:41,200
increasingly responsibility to ensure

696
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:43,440
the systems they sell are resilient and

697
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:45,440
robust in cyberspace as much as they

698
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:47,280
might deliver the primary functions that

699
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:49,679
are observable kind of at the screen

700
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:50,960
governments have the responsibility to

701
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:52,480
use all their instruments of power and

702
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:54,559
appropriate ways to serve their citizens

703
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:56,400
but we shouldn't mix and match those we

704
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,080
shouldn't have individuals stand in the

705
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:59,919
shoes of government and attempt to take

706
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:01,200
on inherently governmental

707
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,480
responsibility well that's the when you

708
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:04,240
have this this public-private

709
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:05,440
partnership

710
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:06,320
and

711
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:08,880
your partner the private sector sees say

712
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:10,559
their partner the government struggling

713
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:13,600
with something it might be very um

714
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,200
enticing them to say hey you know what

715
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,720
we've got this we're going to turn off

716
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:18,080
that route we're just not going to pass

717
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:19,600
email to there we're going to back you

718
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:20,480
up

719
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:21,840
and at some point the governments are

720
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:23,120
going to have to provide guidance like

721
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:25,520
no no it's okay keep the mail flowing or

722
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:27,440
not

723
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:28,640
i think that's the nature of

724
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,400
collaboration is you don't collaborate

725
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,240
so that you can all do the same thing

726
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:33,679
you collaborate so that you can each

727
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:35,520
bring your distinct

728
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:37,360
responsibilities and authorities

729
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:38,960
expertise to the table in a way that

730
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:40,799
they complement one another but

731
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:42,400
remembering and retaining that

732
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,080
distinction between what one is

733
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:46,000
authorized to do and the other might not

734
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,919
right use those in a complementary

735
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:50,320
fashion but not get confused about who

736
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:52,559
has the authority to do what right we

737
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:54,159
don't want to set up a system where we

738
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:56,480
lose any sense of what order and

739
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:58,000
discipline looks like we have no

740
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,840
expectations about what good behavior

741
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:01,840
looks like because you have no idea who

742
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:04,240
who owns what authority and how you can

743
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:05,919
hold them accountable for that

744
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:07,360
governments are held accountable by

745
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:09,200
their citizenry and they're sustained in

746
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:11,200
power or not based on whether they serve

747
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,120
the needs of their citizens companies

748
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:14,960
have a different kind of model in terms

749
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:17,039
of how they sustain and are successful

750
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:18,799
in what they do we need to make sure we

751
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:20,480
distinguish between those governing

752
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,080
mechanisms and and treat those

753
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:24,320
appropriately in this collaboration

754
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:27,039
there's um

755
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,200
there's this the concept of a

756
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,960
proportional response

757
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:32,880
and the

758
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:35,039
if you're having a non-military response

759
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:37,039
a diplomatic response and the diplomat

760
00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:38,480
looks at his tool belt and he's like

761
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:40,000
i've got you know i've got these

762
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
different tools and now all of a sudden

763
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,080
maybe that he's got a tool in there now

764
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:46,000
he or she's got a tool in there that's a

765
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,120
internet related sanction

766
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:50,880
and the one of the things that made me

767
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:52,000
uh

768
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,200
surprised me but it made me smile um was

769
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,720
uh i don't know if you if you notice

770
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:58,080
when india

771
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,600
had this border

772
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,520
skirmish with china

773
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:02,799
and

774
00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:04,480
instead of escalating

775
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:05,760
they're trying to do a below threshold

776
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:07,279
of war they're trying to do some kind of

777
00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:09,840
response to show that they're upset

778
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:11,200
and so

779
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:14,400
they banned a ton of chinese apps from

780
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,720
the indian app stores play store and

781
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:18,320
apple app store

782
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:20,000
and that was brilliant i mean it was an

783
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,400
economic response so a new tool goes in

784
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:25,120
the tool belt this this app diplomacy as

785
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:27,279
i'm calling it goes in the tool belt

786
00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:28,400
and

787
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:29,440
and

788
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:31,279
i think tick tock actually came out and

789
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:32,640
was very upset about they said that's

790
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,880
going to cost us about 6 billion

791
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:36,640
in the indian economy

792
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:39,200
like that's not fair

793
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:42,640
and india it's like too bad and china

794
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:44,799
went to try to ban indian apps and

795
00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:47,120
realized there's no indian apps in the

796
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:48,880
chinese app store because they don't

797
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,080
allow them

798
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:52,559
so it didn't there was no counter move

799
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:54,400
right it was a brilliant chess maneuver

800
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:56,400
and so it seems like we're entering this

801
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:59,679
area where the diplomats and countries i

802
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:01,760
mean and companies are getting these new

803
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:03,279
tools that are just popping up in their

804
00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:04,720
tool belt that they might not even

805
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:07,360
realize that tool existed so it's got to

806
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:10,320
be a really exciting time thinking

807
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:12,559
through and watching how these these new

808
00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:15,360
modes of diplomacy are signaling to each

809
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:17,440
other's is coming forth exciting has

810
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:19,279
many manifestations

811
00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:21,039
but but leaving aside the efficacy of

812
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:22,880
that particular move i would say that

813
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:24,799
what it really represents i think in my

814
00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:26,320
view beyond what you've said quite

815
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:27,600
thoughtfully

816
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:29,360
is that if something happens in

817
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:31,279
cyberspace the right answer might not be

818
00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:32,880
in cyberspace now that looked like

819
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:34,240
something that happened in cyberspace

820
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:36,400
but it really was an economic play it

821
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:38,080
was using the instrument of economic

822
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:39,840
power to achieve some degree of

823
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:42,159
influence so i thought four or five

824
00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:44,400
years ago when we began collectively to

825
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:47,120
say that cyber is an instrument of power

826
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:48,960
that that was less a representation and

827
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,960
we're about to then mobilize cyber to

828
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:53,600
achieve influence in its own right than

829
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:55,679
it was about saying that cyber is just

830
00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:57,679
an instrument of power that it's one of

831
00:26:57,679 --> 00:26:59,360
many instruments of power if something

832
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:02,000
happens in cyberspace the right response

833
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,799
may entirely be outside of cyberspace

834
00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:06,480
and in the realm of nation to nation it

835
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:08,799
might be diplomacy legal sanctions

836
00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:11,200
public shaming all manner of things that

837
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:13,360
one nation can do to influence another

838
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:15,039
we need to put cyber in its rightful

839
00:27:15,039 --> 00:27:17,600
place no more no less so you think it's

840
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:19,679
like a maturing or growing up the space

841
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:22,480
has now entered parity with the other i

842
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:24,480
do i do such that we no longer think of

843
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:27,440
cyber as a silo where a cyber activity

844
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:30,159
requires a cyber response cyber has long

845
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:32,000
shown its ability to affect things well

846
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,240
outside of cyberspace to include public

847
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:36,159
confidence we need to make sure that we

848
00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:38,399
treat cyber in the same way that we use

849
00:27:38,399 --> 00:27:40,159
the full panoply of all the instruments

850
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:42,559
at our disposal in a thoughtful way

851
00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:44,000
again you mentioned necessity and

852
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,240
proportionality according to the rules

853
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:48,080
of necessity and proportionality to have

854
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:50,880
the most deft response possible right to

855
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:52,320
make sure we have the impact that we

856
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:55,039
desire and nothing more

857
00:27:55,039 --> 00:27:56,399
i think that's a fascinating point that

858
00:27:56,399 --> 00:27:58,399
it's now on par because if you think

859
00:27:58,399 --> 00:27:59,279
about

860
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:01,200
airspace restrictions oh we're closing

861
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:03,600
the airspace over the country

862
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:05,440
now there's proportional kind of well

863
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:08,240
you could close the internet or or um

864
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:10,159
i'm thinking back many years ago when

865
00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:11,760
the russian business network criminal

866
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:13,679
operation was kind of bulletproof

867
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:15,840
hosting out of russia and they couldn't

868
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:17,600
get a response from law enforcement and

869
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,440
operators could not get a response from

870
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:20,480
the government

871
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:23,200
and eventually they just de-peered

872
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:25,279
the whole rbn as

873
00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:26,960
like you just don't get traffic anymore

874
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:29,039
because the civil society private sector

875
00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:31,360
had had enough and they just de-peered

876
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:32,960
them

877
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:35,120
and those kinds of thoughts are

878
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:36,880
fascinating to me because it's not

879
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:38,559
playing out the way the internet was

880
00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:41,039
sort of so you know promised and part of

881
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:42,799
what it tells me and especially for this

882
00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:44,799
audience i know kind of

883
00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:46,960
that you're deeply technical but but

884
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:48,880
that technology is not the only play in

885
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:51,600
cyberspace increasingly a significant

886
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,279
play is how do we get the roles and

887
00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:54,880
responsibilities right to your much

888
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:56,799
earlier point how do we make sure the

889
00:28:56,799 --> 00:28:58,480
people skills are what they should be so

890
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:00,159
that everyone can get take full

891
00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:02,240
advantage of cyberspace and then of

892
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:04,320
course technology has a very significant

893
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:07,200
role to play but it doesn't drive alone

894
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:09,919
the outcomes that we seek in cyberspace

895
00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:11,760
i think for too long because we've not

896
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:13,520
defined roles and responsibilities and

897
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:16,799
the skills have been uneven um we've had

898
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:19,679
uneven results from the technology that

899
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:21,200
while one party might have predicted the

900
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:23,360
way that would play out various other

901
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:25,120
parties not being cut into that

902
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:26,480
understanding or

903
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:28,559
aspiration we're unable to meet their

904
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:29,840
end of the bargain we need to get all

905
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:32,320
three of those right this um

906
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:33,919
this idea of the

907
00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:35,919
sort of super empowered individual or

908
00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:37,919
super empowered company mike microsoft

909
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:41,120
doing their report apple doing an update

910
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:44,159
mongodb deleting russian accounts

911
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:45,919
anonymous deciding they're going to

912
00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:48,399
attack assets right these individuals

913
00:29:48,399 --> 00:29:50,559
now that have a disproportional amount

914
00:29:50,559 --> 00:29:52,720
of influence or power in the cyber realm

915
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:54,720
that they don't have in the physical

916
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:56,960
realm um

917
00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:01,919
again exciting yet disturbing like i

918
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:03,600
i'm wondering if

919
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:06,399
does a collective or group of of people

920
00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:08,640
or companies get so much influence in

921
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,720
this super-empowered space that they're

922
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:13,200
effectively sort of another political

923
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:14,799
entity

924
00:30:14,799 --> 00:30:17,679
not a nation-state bounded to physical

925
00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:19,360
geography but

926
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:21,440
um i don't know an association of

927
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:23,039
network operators that say you know what

928
00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:25,360
we're all deciding x

929
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:28,879
sorry that's what our decision is

930
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:30,240
and i'm not sure really if that's a

931
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:32,320
question or an open-ended area to have a

932
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:34,320
conversation but

933
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:36,320
i don't see how the genie goes back in

934
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:38,960
the bottle i don't see how people who

935
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:39,679
now

936
00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:43,039
have realized their agency

937
00:30:43,039 --> 00:30:46,159
or their impact they can have

938
00:30:46,159 --> 00:30:47,679
relinquishing that

939
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:49,840
and so is it going to be an accelerant

940
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:51,600
it just gravity pulls us in that

941
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:52,880
direction

942
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:54,799
or is it just a point in time because of

943
00:30:54,799 --> 00:30:57,600
the urgency of the russian invasion

944
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:59,360
i'm not sure how to process but i know

945
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:01,279
things are changing i know it's

946
00:31:01,279 --> 00:31:03,120
uncomfortable and i don't think we'll

947
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:05,039
ever go back to the way

948
00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:06,000
it was

949
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,159
i think we clearly have experienced a

950
00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:10,159
leverage on the part of those companies

951
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:11,840
and maybe in the future when those

952
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:13,679
companies combine their efforts in ways

953
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:15,679
we can't yet predict a leverage that

954
00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:17,919
would be different in kind but it's not

955
00:31:17,919 --> 00:31:19,919
the first time that we've seen a very

956
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:22,159
significant impact on society that

957
00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:24,320
attends to market forces

958
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:25,919
that essentially determine their own

959
00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:26,880
future

960
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:29,840
i think in the late 1800s early 1900s in

961
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:32,240
the united states industrialists had

962
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:34,399
significant impact in terms of the scope

963
00:31:34,399 --> 00:31:36,159
and scale that industrialism brought to

964
00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:38,399
the american landscape and at that point

965
00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:40,960
they were largely ungoverned unregulated

966
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:42,960
that's not to say that regulation is the

967
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:45,039
whole answer here but to some extent

968
00:31:45,039 --> 00:31:46,559
that we need to understand where

969
00:31:46,559 --> 00:31:48,399
excesses are not in the interest of

970
00:31:48,399 --> 00:31:51,200
society and stand in to ensure that on

971
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:53,120
behalf of the citizens governments are

972
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:54,559
empowered to serve

973
00:31:54,559 --> 00:31:57,120
we ensure that the responsibilities that

974
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:59,600
a commercial or a private concern has

975
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:01,519
are used for the benefit of those

976
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:03,360
citizens as opposed to holding those

977
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:05,440
citizens at risk i don't think at this

978
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:07,440
moment in time i've seen excesses that i

979
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:10,000
would say must be curbed i take the open

980
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,519
question though as being a question that

981
00:32:11,519 --> 00:32:13,519
we should consider going forward to

982
00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:14,960
ensure that we never let that be the

983
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:15,840
case

984
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:17,679
right

985
00:32:17,679 --> 00:32:19,600
and whose role and responsibility is it

986
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:22,240
to decide oh they've gone too far

987
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:24,320
right i think governments are instituted

988
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:26,159
to serve the interest of their citizens

989
00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:28,399
both to to to deliver what those

990
00:32:28,399 --> 00:32:30,640
individual citizens might require or

991
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:32,799
aspire to have as individuals but

992
00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:34,799
collective security as well

993
00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:36,559
and in the united states right what

994
00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:38,159
we've seen is in all those other

995
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:40,000
industries i refer to

996
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,960
automobile aviation food health safety

997
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:44,559
right that again self enlightenment

998
00:32:44,559 --> 00:32:46,640
market forces get you so far but at that

999
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:48,399
point governments typically

1000
00:32:48,399 --> 00:32:50,240
traditionally stand in to say by

1001
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:51,840
exception with the lightest possible

1002
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:53,760
touch here are the further things that

1003
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:55,600
must be done to ensure that we serve the

1004
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:58,559
population with safe reliable products

1005
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:00,320
that meet their expectations and don't

1006
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:03,919
hold them at unnecessary risk

1007
00:33:03,919 --> 00:33:05,919
so

1008
00:33:05,919 --> 00:33:07,120
maybe sort of related to the

1009
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:08,720
super-empowered individual as sort of

1010
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:10,559
this role of sort of open source

1011
00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:12,240
intelligence that we're starting to

1012
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,840
really see start to play

1013
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:15,760
a role and there was always people that

1014
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:17,840
had access to some spot satellite

1015
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:19,919
imagery and they would write an article

1016
00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:22,480
for a magazine or newspaper but now the

1017
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:24,320
imagery is almost just real time all the

1018
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:26,880
time at a higher resolution and then you

1019
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:28,559
have open source

1020
00:33:28,559 --> 00:33:31,519
groups that apply like a forensics

1021
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:33,600
accountancy or a investigative

1022
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:35,919
reporter's mindset like bellingcat and

1023
00:33:35,919 --> 00:33:38,480
they apply it to

1024
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:41,039
poisonings of people dissidents in the

1025
00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:43,760
uk and they unravel this whole

1026
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:45,679
and they're taking this mindset and

1027
00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:46,960
they're accessing the data that

1028
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:49,360
previously had not been available

1029
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:51,200
and they're teaching others and there is

1030
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:53,600
an open sort of a civil society way

1031
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:54,880
they're teaching essentially anybody

1032
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:57,200
that wants to learn how to do this and

1033
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:59,600
now i understand that they um have been

1034
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:01,279
accepted as a source for submitting

1035
00:34:01,279 --> 00:34:02,399
evidence for

1036
00:34:02,399 --> 00:34:05,279
war crimes to the united nations

1037
00:34:05,279 --> 00:34:08,639
like that that wasn't around five ten

1038
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:10,800
years ago right that is a fundamentally

1039
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:13,760
new capability of civil society

1040
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:16,560
and informing the public debate

1041
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:17,440
um

1042
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:18,719
again

1043
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:21,040
i don't see that going backwards i see

1044
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:23,280
that one bell and cat five others 10

1045
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:25,839
others 50 others

1046
00:34:25,839 --> 00:34:28,159
and in in that world like what is your

1047
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:29,679
reaction to that are you cheering it on

1048
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:30,879
or are you like

1049
00:34:30,879 --> 00:34:32,399
worried that

1050
00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:33,918
at some point they'll bump into

1051
00:34:33,918 --> 00:34:36,239
governance and you'll have to i think

1052
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:38,719
that can be and and has been today quite

1053
00:34:38,719 --> 00:34:40,399
useful quite thoughtful now you

1054
00:34:40,399 --> 00:34:42,719
characterize that as the kind of

1055
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:44,000
synthesis

1056
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,079
aggregation synthesis and determination

1057
00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:48,719
of insights from open source information

1058
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:50,719
right that's an extension of what the

1059
00:34:50,719 --> 00:34:52,320
press does within the united states of

1060
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:54,960
america and so many other places we call

1061
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:56,719
the press within the united states the

1062
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:58,960
fourth estate and traditionally it's had

1063
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:00,560
a role to essentially on behalf of the

1064
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:02,960
public going to just give another view

1065
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:05,119
as to what's transpiring and how and why

1066
00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:06,800
and what those trends might be hold the

1067
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,560
government accountable

1068
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:10,880
transparency kind of light shined into a

1069
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:13,040
room is a great antiseptic to make sure

1070
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:14,640
that we understand what's happening and

1071
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:16,320
why and we can hold the parties

1072
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:18,640
accountable but again you characterized

1073
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:20,480
and based your kind of your assessment

1074
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:22,880
on on open source information we need to

1075
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:24,640
make sure if someone has a legitimate

1076
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:26,560
interest in privacy and they've taken

1077
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:29,760
pains to kind of secure that privacy

1078
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:31,760
that we don't let others careen into

1079
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:33,920
that and rem and reveal that information

1080
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:36,079
that is the property of that individual

1081
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:37,599
and so that's where perhaps there might

1082
00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:39,760
be some refereeing that's necessary to

1083
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:40,880
ensure that we kind of put some

1084
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:42,880
safeguards in so when when i first

1085
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:45,520
really became aware of say billing cat

1086
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:47,520
i was thinking to myself well surely the

1087
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:49,520
uk law enforcement and intelligence

1088
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:51,440
they're trying to track down these

1089
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:53,040
you know killers and they're trying to

1090
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:55,119
unravel it all and

1091
00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:57,680
why is it it's the civil society people

1092
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:59,119
doing what i would always have thought

1093
00:35:59,119 --> 00:36:00,480
would have been a law enforcement role

1094
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:02,640
and is it because civil society got so

1095
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:05,119
fed up that they weren't seen visible or

1096
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:06,320
it was because the government was

1097
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:07,839
balancing 50 other political

1098
00:36:07,839 --> 00:36:10,480
calculations telling cat is not burdened

1099
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:11,920
with those calculations they're just

1100
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:12,960
trying to get

1101
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:14,960
the facts out there and so that

1102
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:16,960
decoupling between the facts sort of

1103
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:18,800
generation and all the political

1104
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:20,400
calculations

1105
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:22,240
does that free up government now to say

1106
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:24,880
hey it wasn't us

1107
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:26,560
this other government provided the

1108
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:28,880
information so now we have to act well

1109
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:30,640
the government can't benefit from the

1110
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:32,720
fruit of a poisoned tree so if the

1111
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:34,240
activities that would collect that

1112
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:36,160
information provide that information are

1113
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:37,680
something that the government shouldn't

1114
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:38,640
do

1115
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:39,920
then the government shouldn't benefit

1116
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:41,599
from that so there's a line to be drawn

1117
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:43,839
there that being said what you find is

1118
00:36:43,839 --> 00:36:46,480
that many governments are loathed to

1119
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:48,640
kind of produce information on their

1120
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:51,040
civil society in ways that are beyond

1121
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:54,079
what is necessary engage in kind of

1122
00:36:54,079 --> 00:36:57,119
discovery activities with no basis of

1123
00:36:57,119 --> 00:36:58,560
thinking that there's something amiss in

1124
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:00,320
the first place so you just need to make

1125
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:02,240
sure that you've kind of not allowed

1126
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:04,240
government to exceed what are the

1127
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:06,800
traditional boundaries of government to

1128
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:08,240
act only when there's kind of a

1129
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:10,160
necessity for that action

1130
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:12,400
and therefore these kind of broad

1131
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:14,800
excursions into the data sets available

1132
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:16,560
to these private concerns

1133
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:18,480
can't constitute the creation of a

1134
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:19,839
capability that you don't want

1135
00:37:19,839 --> 00:37:21,200
government to have and that you've

1136
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:22,560
borrowed government to have that should

1137
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:24,640
be a line we shouldn't cross it there's

1138
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:25,680
a um

1139
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:27,119
at least in this community a lot of

1140
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:28,480
people want to get involved and they

1141
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:29,760
want to help

1142
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:31,599
um and so they'll say hey i've got a day

1143
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:33,119
job but i really i have all these skills

1144
00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:35,040
i want to help what can i do and all of

1145
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:36,800
a sudden now there are these other

1146
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:39,040
on-ramps to help and so

1147
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:40,320
citizen lab

1148
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:41,920
ron diebert's

1149
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:44,079
initiative up at the monk school in

1150
00:37:44,079 --> 00:37:45,599
toronto

1151
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:47,920
they've done all these reports about

1152
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:50,560
spyware targeting nso

1153
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:52,800
pegasus spyware targeting governmental

1154
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:54,480
leaders and

1155
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:55,760
and if you look at who's writing these

1156
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:57,839
reports who's doing the work again it's

1157
00:37:57,839 --> 00:37:59,599
not government that's revealing this

1158
00:37:59,599 --> 00:38:01,599
it's private sector civil society doing

1159
00:38:01,599 --> 00:38:03,200
these deep dives with access to

1160
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:05,839
partnerships to other

1161
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:08,160
and it seems like if

1162
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:10,480
if part of the community wants to help

1163
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:13,119
for example billing cat gives classes on

1164
00:38:13,119 --> 00:38:17,520
it can you think of ways in which

1165
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:20,400
people who want to help like how do they

1166
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:23,119
help how does an empowered individual

1167
00:38:23,119 --> 00:38:26,640
help is it just providing comment is it

1168
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:28,400
offering feedback or is it just trying

1169
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:30,240
to make sure that their company

1170
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:32,720
is following a rules-based

1171
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:35,119
order like

1172
00:38:35,119 --> 00:38:36,720
you've got this audience of technical

1173
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:38,640
experts you know how would you that they

1174
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:40,400
leave here and they're like yes i'm i'm

1175
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:43,040
all for what has been said

1176
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:45,280
where do i put my energy is it mean a

1177
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:46,720
civil society group great question i

1178
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:48,400
might point their time and attention to

1179
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:50,480
the fact that 85 percent of the things

1180
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:52,400
that go wrong in cyberspace are

1181
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:55,200
attributable to a human error or perhaps

1182
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:56,400
a failure to get the roles and

1183
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:57,760
responsibilities right we just didn't

1184
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:00,320
set ourselves up to be a hard target and

1185
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:02,640
so some more time and attention left of

1186
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:03,760
the event

1187
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:05,200
i think would be very appropriate

1188
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:06,880
helping people understand how do you set

1189
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:08,960
up a defensible system how do you make

1190
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:10,640
sure that it actually doesn't have any

1191
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:12,800
gaping holes in it in terms of how it's

1192
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:14,000
been patched or how it's been

1193
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,880
constituted um is it clear that the data

1194
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:19,440
that's in that system is well defended

1195
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:21,200
and that there's a stout defense mounted

1196
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:22,960
on top of that there's a lot more work

1197
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:24,880
to be done in that regard i think if we

1198
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:26,560
spent more time left of the event we'd

1199
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:28,400
worry less about what we have to do in

1200
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:30,160
or right of the event because there'll

1201
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:32,400
be fewer of them and so there's a huge

1202
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:34,000
amount of talent that can be applied to

1203
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,520
that ladder actually it kind of reminds

1204
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:36,800
me of a bumper sticker i see in the

1205
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:39,040
united states which says think globally

1206
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:41,440
act locally i agree so it's sort of

1207
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:43,280
think of the global and information

1208
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:44,720
environment but

1209
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:46,320
help defend your

1210
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:49,119
i agree we just can't let our pursuit of

1211
00:39:49,119 --> 00:39:51,440
kind of activities in in this space that

1212
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:53,839
we know are illegitimate or excessive

1213
00:39:53,839 --> 00:39:56,320
and wrong lead us to conduct the same

1214
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:57,920
activities in pursuit of that we just

1215
00:39:57,920 --> 00:39:59,520
need to be careful about making sure

1216
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:00,880
that what you do

1217
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:02,880
holds up to the scrutiny of

1218
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:04,400
are you authorized to do that is that

1219
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:06,160
useful for you to do that is that

1220
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:07,680
something that actually the end of the

1221
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:08,640
day

1222
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:10,480
aids the resilience and robustness of

1223
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:12,319
the system or does it just create more

1224
00:40:12,319 --> 00:40:14,240
chaos and noise in an already chaotic

1225
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:15,359
system

1226
00:40:15,359 --> 00:40:16,800
so

1227
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:18,000
we have

1228
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
one minute left

1229
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,119
and so i just want to thank you for

1230
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:22,720
