00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:09,760
in this session we are going to discuss

3
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:12,240
about how to conduct a backdoor

4
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:15,120
investigation and instance respond from

5
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:17,760
zero to profit

6
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:20,160

9
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:28,160
quantity paused here so maybe we should

so our team is focusing on pen pen

50
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,680
penetrating test purple team test

51
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:08,959
digital response and recently we have

52
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:11,280
come across a lot of incident cases and

53
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,680
that's why we bring our case here to

54
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,239
share with you

55
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:20,239
okay so i'm setter and i'm an assistant

56
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:21,599
professor in

57
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:23,040
smu here

58
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,879
and i'm also a

59

called business with wix rl so that's

60
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:27,920
why i'm

61
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:30,720
this time i represent them to physically

62
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,879
present in here

63
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:33,860
okay so

64
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:35,120
[Music]

65
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,840
let's get started

66
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,519
okay so uh

67
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:46,000
why do we still need to talk about the

68
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,560
beta investigation right maybe uh some

69
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,720
of you work in instance respawn you know

70
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:53,840
that it's a pretty standard stuff to do

71
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,000
the instance respawn right

72
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,040
and we have already got some pretty

73
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:01,440
mature framework from the industry or

74
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,920
maybe we have some existing tools like

75
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:06,720
virustotal to do the malware analysis

76
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,200
then why's we still do have a talk like

77
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,360
this because uh from our actual

78
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,760
experience we found that actually the

79
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:16,400
existing frameworks didn't work well on

80
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,840
this kind of a

81
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,760
stealthy malware

82
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:22,800
battle so that's why we propose a

83
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,720
new framework that's dedicated for a

84
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,720
better investigation

85
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:29,200
so now i'll pass to ellen to introduce

86
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:32,839
the case background

87
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:35,920
hi

88
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:38,640
hi guys before we get into the framework

89
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:42,000
let's have a quick look in the incident

90
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,799
so our team anthony and i is responsible

91
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:47,360
for incident handling for online gaming

92
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,920
company and their id team is in hong

93
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:53,200
kong so the development team and network

94
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:57,360
team and iot as uh in hong kong

95
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,080
so

96
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:01,040
due to the gothic 19 most of the staff

97
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,760
have had to work from home and they use

98
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:06,480
ssl vpn to connect to the company

99
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,519
network

100
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:10,640
so it's all good but until one day

101
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:13,519
the network team is reported that

102
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:16,880
the ssl vpn connections

103
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:19,839
got some weird stuff and there are some

104
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:22,639
authorized verification of the firewalls

105
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:25,199
which happened in the midnight

106
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:27,680
so our team start to investigate this

107
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,040
case

108
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,520
and after a month another allergy was

109
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,360
coming from the iis

110
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,680
so let's take a look

111
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,759
for the investigation

112
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:40,720
so for the ssl vpn issues we interviewed

113
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,880
the endeavor engineers and

114
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,639
system i mean

115
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:45,600
and we

116
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,080
we knew that there were no tasks during

117
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:50,960
that that day or during that midnight

118
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:53,440
and we also looked into the log on and

119
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,440
we found that there is a lot of the

120
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:58,400
attacker in the active directory and

121
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:01,120
then they try to access the firewall and

122
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,639
mean dashboard

123
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:04,800
that that's hot

124
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,600
and the end never engineers has no idea

125
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,080
why their accounts were compromised and

126
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,479
we also asked them about their

127
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:15,360
authentication and they told us that the

128
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:18,800
firewall admin account there were no ufa

129
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,680
and the ssl vpn authentication got no

130
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:25,039
2fa in neither

131
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:28,560
so we look into the ssr vpn device which

132
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:31,840
is the 40 gauge and from the log we

133
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:34,960
found that there was a hong kong iphone

134
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:37,120
for that and during the midnight

135
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:40,000
and then we tracked the sso vpn from the

136
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,680
web ui we found that it could be

137
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,520
accessed from the

138
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:46,400
wonderful three

139
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,680
so

140
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,560
we tried the famous ssrb exploit cvg2

141
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:53,560
cvg201x13379

142
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,560
and we successfully exported the device

143
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:59,039
and got the credentials from the from

144
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:01,600
the device we got the accounts of the

145
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,360
staff the company

146
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,840
so when for many cases

147
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:08,000
the staff like using the same account

148
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,280
for ssl vpn and active direction

149
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,680
so before we do the third exploit we

150
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,039
look at the

151
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:17,360
we look at the stuff from the sperm

152
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,440
so we use the protein technique to check

153
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:22,080
the spun locks and we tried to

154
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:24,240
take a look on the traffic logs for the

155
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,680
ssr vpn

156
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,520
and there were some spikes of fights

157
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:30,240
received from the suspicious and modern

158
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,520
ip address

159
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:34,720
so normally for the azure vpn to

160
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:37,199
establish the connection will produce

161
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:40,080
quite a steady travel however during the

162
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,639
exploit since the attacker can get the

163
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:45,360
credentials the bytes received for much

164
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,280
higher than user

165
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,520
so take a look at that graph you could

166
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,199
see the spice on

167
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:52,080
on

168
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:55,919
friday friday and the first day in the

169
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:58,400
graph there are some spikes

170
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,880
but we realized that the attack could

171
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:03,360
happen during that period because the

172
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,919
attacker got the credentials and so the

173
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:08,080
traffic of the credentials was much

174
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,919
higher than normal

175
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:12,400
normal

176
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:15,599
so after we confirmed the necessary pain

177
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:18,160
exploit we try to do some further

178
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:21,280
analysis for the experimentation

179
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:23,680
so we've got the ssl vpn to dance so

180
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,120
that we tried that

181
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:28,240
on the active direction and

182
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,039
we're

183
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:31,599
lucky we found the iphs

184
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:34,319
after the never discovery got the ad

185
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:36,960
then we tried to scan the pause and we

186
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:41,120
found that there are over five so smb

187
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:44,240
so we try to do the channel pool attack

188
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,960
and then we also got into the

189
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:49,680
anti-damage driver successfully

190
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:52,479
then you can try to create some accounts

191
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:55,199
you can see that

192
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:58,080
and it's so that we could really own the

193
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:00,240
active direction you could see

194
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,319
you could see why the client is still

195
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:04,400
got the internal proof

196
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,400
so you could see that

197
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,479
a company

198
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:10,240
they focus a lot of business but they

199
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:13,360
didn't update the server more regularly

200
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,280
so that's why some still suffer of this

201
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:17,840
waterfront yeah yes you can

202
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:20,000
see from the from the

203
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,280
first line this is still using 2012 how

204
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:26,160
to serve and return any pages so we

205
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,400
could run the returner who exploit quite

206
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,960
successfully and hold the server we

207
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:34,240
created the icons and even we put the

208
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:37,839
hong.txt files on the server

209
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:42,320
so let's jump to the first conclusion

210
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:45,600
so um we found that the sslv pin export

211
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,000
was successful and it could lead to the

212
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,040
internal network intrusion and the led

213
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:53,519
could be owned as well and you could see

214
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:55,920
the account of pawn.pxt

215
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:58,480
then for the natural movement we believe

216
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,880
that the attackers will also compromise

217
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:03,600
other important servers

218
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,000
so for this ssl european exploitation

219
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,279
incident

220
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:09,839
after a month later we fought there

221
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:12,240
there was other hacking activities this

222
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:15,440
time this is for the is server because

223
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,320
there were

224
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,160
two island servers

225
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:21,200
here we named it as o1 and o2

226
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:24,720
the o1 is server is the fantastic and

227
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:27,200
the ios server o2 was a new server to

228
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:30,000
replace the server one after the hacking

229
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,160
activities but then we find something

230
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:35,670
strange so that it needs to continue

231
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:37,920
[Music]

232
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,680
yeah

233
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:43,120
how can we haunt the bat door you know

234
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,800
sometimes the bat door is not just

235
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,399
punched by

236
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:48,800
maybe externally or internally you don't

237
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:51,040
have you don't ever know who is trying

238
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:53,040
to compromise the system

239
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:55,040
and who is working on it

240
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,240
however

241
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,600
it's very

242
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,519
interesting for that

243
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:02,560
first of all uh as alan mentioned

244
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:06,720
the i surface o2 is the newly installed

245
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:09,360
server engineers find some error holding

246
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,440
errors in the morning and they report to

247
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,320
us

248
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,480
it's they find that there's a module

249
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:17,200
there's some dll trying static dot dll

250
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:20,000
is cannot be load successfully

251
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,160
to the is web server

252
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:25,360
and keep do keep folding or keep

253
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:28,160
keep doing have our error message out so

254
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,920
that's why

255
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:33,200
it really make a alarming message for to

256
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,360
us what what's happened all right it's

257
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:38,079
not normal

258
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:41,360
the engineers reportedly installed um

259
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:44,240
the new server for the is but but just

260
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:46,560
cloning just copying the same

261
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:49,360
configuration files from the

262
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:52,480
affected server are better or inverted o

263
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:53,519
server

264
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:55,920
but the is error implies that dll was

265
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:58,160
missing and could not be loaded the is

266
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,519
web server

267
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:02,000
so we try to check out what the dll

268
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,160
what's going on with the

269
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:07,279
the dll what is it actually

270
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:09,360
and from the screen we capture from the

271
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,519
rectum rectum server

272
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:13,440
you can find it there the

273
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,920
control static.dol

274
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:18,399
it looks like quite weird to us

275
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:21,279
so we checked a little bit some metadata

276
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:22,800
the properties later

277
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,560
on the left side of the screen you could

278
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,240
see the mailway and the backdoor and the

279
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:29,680
right side of the llama of the normal

280
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:33,040
properties data you could find that some

281
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:35,680
typically for the malware 101 you can

282
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:38,079
find it the description and even the

283
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:41,440
vendors or some information

284
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,839
of the of the executable is missing or

285
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:47,120
not correct inaccurate so it looks like

286
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:49,680
suspicious the file that means it's not

287
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,839
a legitimate library files

288
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:55,680
should be in the system okay

289
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,839
and after that we tried to trace it

290
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:00,959
trace the event as well and

291
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:04,000
the dll was attempted to be unload but

292
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,360
not successful

293
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,680
all right so that's why we have some

294
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:10,000
error message of optimal event not as

295
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,200
well

296
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,360
we try to trace the error for the for

297
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:17,360
the dll loading and unloading

298
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,279
we could have found the malware in the

299
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:23,440
server o2 but only find on server one

300
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,839
but in for the error

301
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:28,560
in the from the server o2 because the is

302
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:29,839
configuration

303
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:32,560
um the application host.config

304
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:35,040
to try to load the malware the ll part i

305
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,880
mean the transthetic.bll

306
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,639
but actually it didn't

307
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:42,800
exist so that's why it caused the error

308
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:46,000
so the case some so that's this is the

309
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
how we detect

310
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:48,800
the

311
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,399
um the bad door

312
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:53,760
um when try to move out to the new

313
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:55,440
platform all right

314
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,920
so the case summary is about first of

315
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,839
all it's about the ssl repair

316
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:02,560
exploitation thank you to deathcore and

317
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:05,040
orange team and to

318
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:07,519
to find out this vulnerability and

319
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:09,200
actually there's a many organization but

320
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:12,480
at that time still available for the ssl

321
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:15,120
vpn um vulnerability

322
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,480
and also the active directory

323
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,560
exploitation that administrates the

324
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,959
administrator accounts are created by

325
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:22,560
the attackers

326
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,000
also that we assume that attackers

327
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,600
access that

328
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,279
also can access the network engineer's

329
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:30,000
desktop by the same password with the

330
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,519
active directory and ssl vpn because

331
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:35,760
their configuration simply just

332
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:38,000
use the same password same account

333
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,920
and they create temporary that domain

334
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,519
icon to sub log in

335
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:44,880
and also the firewall administrator uh

336
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,800
the the console password was saved in

337
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:49,440
the browser they didn't do any remove it

338
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,600
the cache simply keep it as a remember

339
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:52,480
me

340
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:56,000
so they do the lateral movement um

341
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,800
with the eye with the is that door and

342
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:01,279
keep accessing the database information

343
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:03,519
and change the information after that i

344
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:06,959
and allen to apply the to us and work

345
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:09,199
with the infrastructure team to apply

346
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:11,120
the two-factor authentication and also

347
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,480
the patches for the firewall and the

348
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:16,000
servers that's how we try to do some

349
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,800
remediation

350
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:20,959
but the issue is

351
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:23,760
we also is a firefighter all right

352
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,279
firefighting

353
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:27,279
for the front at the front line

354
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:28,079
but

355
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:32,639
we also looks like um like uh um

356
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:36,160
cats catch mouse like a practice

357
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:38,240
it's not really good for us

358
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:41,519
so we are very reactive in our role how

359
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:43,680
can we be a proactive this is why we

360
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,279
want to do

361
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:47,360
the research or why we are here with

362
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:50,959
satellite and also ellen and and ken to

363
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:52,880
do this kind of research hopefully we

364
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:55,120
suggest a systematic way

365
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:58,079
or model to detect some stellar

366
00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:01,120
that is not commonly detected by

367
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,560
some detector

368
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:05,839
or antivirus detector

369
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:08,320
um maybe some of the talks a lot of

370
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,480
talks technical talks will go into the

371
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:13,040
deep analysis of the back door but as an

372
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,880
incident responder

373
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:17,040
we can't say say talk to the current say

374
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:19,519
hey give me two days to find out the bad

375
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:20,320
door

376
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:24,079
the the what's going on they need some

377
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:25,440
immediate

378
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:28,639
action reaction for example any

379
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:30,240
machines are still infected with the

380
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:32,959
better any more malware what can we do

381
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:35,120
they ask these very practical questions

382
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:37,279
okay so that's why

383
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:38,720
um we didn't do

384
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:41,519
deep analysis at the beginning this is

385
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:44,079
it requires an enterprise with more

386
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:47,519
intent afford more resources to do the

387
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:50,399
deep analysis so we propose a more

388
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:54,320
lightweight analysis and detection

389
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,079
and most likely

390
00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:57,839
it's a lightweight i've seen a lot of

391
00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:01,360
academic research or even some practical

392
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,839
one you simply just upload to the public

393
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:06,399
sandbox for analysis this screen is just

394
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:09,440
kept was just captured yesterday

395
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,040
um we simply

396
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:13,519
check our cab our hash and you can

397
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:16,560
upload the uploaded static dll to the

398
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:20,399
virus total we've uploaded since 2020

399
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:24,000
and we analyzed f2021 and also we do the

400
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,240
analysis yesterday

401
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:28,880
just for detector can still

402
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,800
find detect this

403
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,320
um that door

404
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:35,519
and there's some java rules detected and

405
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:36,480
but

406
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,240
these are very common features cannot be

407
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:40,480
figured out this is a bad door so that's

408
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:41,600
the reason

409
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,759
we come to our playbook

410
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:45,920
this is this term is quite good for that

411
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:48,839
is i'm thankful to how we will be robot

412
00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:52,560
members media and also milk

413
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:55,279
to suggest this is a playbook about the

414
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:57,360
better analysis for the passion

415
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,440
and typical antivirus and sandbox cannot

416
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:01,920
be identified highly customized and

417
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,440
targeted capital

418
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,039
we establish try to establish

419
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:07,119
methodology to detect backdoor threat

420
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:09,359
and playbook for insulin response

421
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:11,439
much more efficient much more focused

422
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:13,760
festival to plug and play for the for

423
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:14,559
the

424
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:17,359
methodology

425
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:19,520
in our methodology we have three

426
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,039
different components one is the

427
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:23,760
detection and analysis methodology based

428
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,359
on rule-based

429
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:27,679
statistical based and artificial

430
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:29,679
intelligence space another is the

431
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:32,240
algorithm how about tester for the

432
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:34,559
investigation of the battle and is the

433
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:36,720
detailed matrix to do the investigation

434
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:39,679
for the backdoor can and and can etc

435
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:43,840
will be we'll explain about it later on

436
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:46,000
um for the detection analysis

437
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,120
methodology we simply got

438
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:51,360
two major areas you are very familiar

439
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:52,880
with these two areas first of all is

440
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:55,760
static analysis what is dynamic analysis

441
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,520
dynamic analysis analysis is very

442
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:00,080
popular you simply use some like google

443
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,080
samples any dot one

444
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:04,559
okay to do the to find out the sensitive

445
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:06,320
api they are calling but for the

446
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:08,160
standard analysis most likely for

447
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,919
example we can use the

448
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:14,000
lsh to compare the similarity and java

449
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,919
rules to detect the pattern

450
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:18,320
and but in this stage

451
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:21,440
we do more on string and frequency based

452
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:24,640
analysis and ai based analysis of course

453
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,880
you could do the entropy to detect an

454
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:29,200
obfuscation the level

455
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:31,120
this is all of the techniques are

456
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:32,480
already published

457
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:34,000
it's not

458
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,080
talks about low voltage but how can we

459
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:38,559
combine different coverage techniques to

460
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:40,840
detect this kind of stealthy

461
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:43,440
attack for example

462
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,360
we are doing the string and frequency

463
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:47,520
base we detect the frequency all right

464
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:49,600
the ai base then i'm going to explain

465
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:52,000
about it

466
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:54,559
for the string and frequency based

467
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:57,520
battle indicators we try to first of all

468
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:59,120
extract the string with the length

469
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:01,760
larger than three from the binary our

470
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:03,679
price i will try to attempt to classify

471
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:06,559
the isis pi state strings as single

472
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:08,400
power shell strings that

473
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:11,039
are encoded with base64 or none of the

474
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:12,320
above

475
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:14,000
um actually for the sql and the

476
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,240
powershell script we create a character

477
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:18,720
frequency table with example collected

478
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,799
from microsoft and assures github

479
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:22,240
repository

480
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:24,320
so that's why we can have a distribution

481
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:26,799
statistical distribution to find out

482
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:29,120
what is the normal distribution for the

483
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:31,520
legitimate binaries

484
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:35,280
after that we compare with

485
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:39,600
the dlls or any exe files under or

486
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,039
suspicious file

487
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:43,120
under our target folder and check out

488
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:44,480
the frequency

489
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:47,039
then we can find out the backdoor got a

490
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:48,559
suspicious high

491
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:51,360
number in the sequel and the powershell

492
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:54,480
script the pattern that's how we

493
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:57,120
identify it you know the wherever we are

494
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,640
the point is

495
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:01,120
um as i mentioned

496
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:03,600
many anti-virus detectors cannot detect

497
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,440
it because they find it electricity so

498
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:07,840
that we need another site and a way to

499
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:10,170
detect it

500
00:20:10,170 --> 00:20:11,520
[Music]

501
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:12,480
let me

502
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:13,919
just pass the

503
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:15,520
um

504
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:16,880
my time to

505
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:19,679
ken to continue about it so uh apart

506
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:22,480
from that string

507
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:25,120
apart from the string analysis uh

508
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:27,360
already converted by anthony we also

509
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,600
tried to use ai model to analysis to

510
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:32,159
further analyse our sample

511
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:34,480
as a designer were failed to detect with

512
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,960
any av vendors and also by any endpoint

513
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:39,039
solution during the time we're doing the

514
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:41,600
insulin response um we also tried to

515
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:43,679
examine the correlated sample with our

516
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:45,520
in-house malware

517
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:47,600
detection engine we created before in

518
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:48,640
other

519
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:51,120
research uh while our model may not be

520
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:52,799
capable to deploy as a real-world

521
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:54,880
anti-virus or amphen solution due to a

522
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:57,120
very likely a very very high positive

523
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,159
rate

524
00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:00,000
but in that sense this channel should be

525
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,520
capable for doing

526
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:03,760
some sort of initial challenge and

527
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:06,000
actually our model works pretty well on

528
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,720
detecting some bpt samples as we have

529
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:10,320
done some evaluation

530
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:13,679
before however this is a bit surprising

531
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:16,240
that it's only capable to detect one of

532
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:18,240
the samples out of the five samples we

533
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:20,880
collected from the server

534
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,880
in some sense it also shed lights on the

535
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,640
reason why anti-virus and endpoint

536
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:27,039
solution failed to take the samples

537
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:29,679
as a lot of typical anti-rivals of

538
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:31,039
empower solutions nowadays were

539
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:32,480
signature based

540
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:34,960
in our cases just captured

541
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,600
backbone samples didn't have did

542
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:40,000
magnificent many composers with a lot of

543
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,360
legitimate

544
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:43,520
open source libraries like the json cars

545
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:45,919
or a lot of typical

546
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:49,039
passes and actually they didn't employ a

547
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:51,600
very light trade or even they didn't

548
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:53,840
i remember the sample system

549
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:55,600
applied any obfuscation in the static

550
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:57,600
components and hence it didn't being

551
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,120
threatened by

552
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:01,200
the yara rules at that time or even the

553
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,440
anti-rival solution

554
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:06,000
so this is an explanation for why idea

555
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,960
didn't being detected

556
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:11,520
after comforted with the analysis can be

557
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:13,440
made let's talk about our contribution

558
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:15,360
for this presentation the background

559
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:17,679
incident response algorithm or i would

560
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:20,799
say it is a red pro

561
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:24,159
so as you can see the slides

562
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:26,240
here is a very high overview of our

563
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:28,240
incident response algorithm or the

564
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:29,600
workflow

565
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:32,080
we will try to model the overall network

566
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:34,960
and architecture as a graph and we will

567
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:37,039
try to use i will use the right text to

568
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:40,480
represent the server workstation or any

569
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:43,120
devices and the edges will be used to

570
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:45,919
represent to the connection between

571
00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:48,400
different nodes or different devices

572
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,159
where we will try to mark the full color

573
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:52,640
as the trusted connection and red color

574
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:54,880
as trusted connection and then we will

575
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:56,240
pick a target and start our

576
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:57,600
investigation

577
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:00,000
and we have to check some criterias for

578
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,520
example in our case we will try to

579
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:04,480
examine the user authentication and also

580
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:06,480
to look for any suspicion operating

581
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:08,799
suspicious operation like for example

582
00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:11,440
that did it create execute did they

583
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:14,000
create operations this pattern is a very

584
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
common background

585
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,520
activities

586
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:19,440
or we can look for the ratio between the

587
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:23,039
number of account authenticator for

588
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,280
this is

589
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,039
aims to detangle

590
00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:33,280
any possible lateral movement lateral

591
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:36,000
movement from a certain machine apart

592
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,360
from this type of

593
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:39,840
typical features we will we can also

594
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:41,440
examine the configuration difference

595
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:44,880
from the original coding copy of our

596
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:47,039
our shuffle configuration or whatever

597
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:48,400
configuration

598
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:51,520
and then if any of these criteria is uh

599
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:53,360
mentioned we will try to further

600
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:54,960
investigate that

601
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:57,440
machine or that notes um one of the good

602
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,840
things about workflow is that it is a

603
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:01,919
highly extendable highly extensible and

604
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:05,679
we can replace any of the criterias

605
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:07,520
with the

606
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:09,840
due to the incident or the environment

607
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:12,240
of our architecture

608
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:14,480
so here maybe this is a bit abstract to

609
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:16,159
talk about from verbs let's talk

610
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:17,679
different examples

611
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:20,480
and here is a very high over highly high

612
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,559
high level overview of our

613
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:23,679
internet

614
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:26,080
level architecture of our of our

615
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:27,600
enterprise

616
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,760
and the blue color is the trusted

617
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:32,880
connection i see it is some nintendo's

618
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:33,919
stuff

619
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:35,840
and red is red

620
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:38,799
red edge is means the interesting party

621
00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:41,360
experience here

622
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:44,720
and here is the overall modeling of the

623
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:48,159
enterprise network architecture

624
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:49,919
and as the incident

625
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:52,480
starts from the database so we will mark

626
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:55,840
database as our target

627
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:58,240
and we will try to investigate

628
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:00,159
and then we will try to investigate from

629
00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:02,880
the nodes connected to our database one

630
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:05,120
by one with the criteria we defined

631
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:06,720
before

632
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:09,120
and firstly we will try to examine for

633
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:11,120
for example we started from our

634
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:14,400
web server

635
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,320
we will start from our web server later

636
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:19,360
case at the iis iii server and we will

637
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:21,200
examine for ind suspicious

638
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:23,600
authentication and activities appears on

639
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:25,360
the east server

640
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:27,279
and then we will check the ratio

641
00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:29,440
measurement to ratio number of

642
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:31,039
authenticated system

643
00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:33,279
connected to different users and if it

644
00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:35,279
is greater than one will mark this as a

645
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:37,279
suspicious node

646
00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:38,880
and then we will try to if the

647
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:41,200
configuration file of this node with the

648
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,559
expected building copies of the

649
00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:44,080
configuration

650
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:46,240
and in our case if any

651
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:48,559
of these three criteria type in these

652
00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:50,480
matches we will set this node as a

653
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:52,320
suspicious node and then we'll continue

654
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:53,840
our investigation

655
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:56,640
towards other connected to the database

656
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:58,960
and here is the final result and

657
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:00,559
basically we find that the web server is

658
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:02,640
suspicious and then we will try to try

659
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,000
to mark any

660
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,799
uh outbound edges from this server as a

661
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:09,520
unjust connection and as you can see

662
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:10,960
this becomes

663
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:12,880
original is improved and then now it's

664
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,720
compressed and then we'll try to

665
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:16,720
investigate adam's other server

666
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:18,880
connected to it

667
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:20,159
and

668
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:22,080
and then we will try to run the status

669
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,120
after we

670
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:25,200
investigate all the ledger's edges

671
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,880
connected to the database we'll try to

672
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,559
set this as the target again and then

673
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:29,760
we'll try to

674
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:32,159
run the algorithm again

675
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:32,960
and

676
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:35,600
after we collected a set of suspicious

677
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:38,400
notes we will try to run the

678
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,720
backdoor incident response metric on

679
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:43,679
this machine or this nodes

680
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:45,120
and

681
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,880
in that sense our workflow can

682
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:49,039
prioritize our investigation we saw

683
00:26:49,039 --> 00:26:51,200
resources rather than exhaustively

684
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,720
examine all of the machine in the

685
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:54,159
network which is

686
00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:56,640
quite time consuming and maybe not

687
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,480
meet the business needs of

688
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:00,720
clients or the enterprises

689
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,880
so let's talk about the incident

690
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:07,080
response metric we come up with

691
00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:12,000
so we have talked about the case

692
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,600
background and how do we do the

693
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:14,880
investigation

694
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:16,799
and also some of the algorithms that

695
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:20,240
help us to speed up the instance respond

696
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:22,640
so now we are going to propose a

697
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:25,120
backdoor instance response matrix

698
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:27,600
let's summarize this and list out the

699
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:28,880
different

700
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:30,720
steps and procedures

701
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:33,200
so basically we need to focus on three

702
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:34,640
dimensions

703
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,320
the first one would be the backdoor or

704
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:39,279
the suspicious bad dot files

705
00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:40,880
and the second one would be the backdoor

706
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:43,279
server or the server that looks

707
00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:44,480
suspicious

708
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:46,159
is under attack

709
00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:47,840
and the first one will be the network

710
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:50,240
traffic

711
00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:53,120
so for the battle itself yeah you may

712
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:55,679
get a lot of different suspicious files

713
00:27:55,679 --> 00:27:58,480
and you need to do investigation on each

714
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:00,159
one right that may be quite time

715
00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:03,600
consuming but yeah still we want to

716
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:04,960
include this

717
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:06,799
functionality analysis

718
00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:08,480
so usually

719
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:10,799
you may get some errors

720
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:12,799
or reports from the user saying that

721
00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:15,600
yeah something wrong with these

722
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:17,440
surface and then you may

723
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:20,159
take out and see what kind of

724
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:21,679
features

725
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:23,600
so in our case uh you see that the

726
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:26,159
transthetic dot dll keeps throwing the

727
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:28,000
errors so that's why you can find out

728
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:28,799
this

729
00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:30,720
suspicious file

730
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:32,880
and of course after that you want to

731
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:35,279
do a comprehensive analysis like a

732
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:36,799
static analysis

733
00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:39,200
or dynamic analysis with the emulation

734
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:40,559
framework

735
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:42,640
so anthony uh i think

736
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:43,840
you also

737
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:46,480
outsource this kind of

738
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:49,200
static and dynamic analysis uh

739
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:50,640
so how long

740
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:52,559
typically will you take to do a

741
00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:55,760
comprehensive analysis

742
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:58,640
no because the you know it very takes

743
00:28:58,640 --> 00:28:59,679
time

744
00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:01,039
so that's why

745
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:03,360
sometimes uh

746
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:06,480
you need your set up your own sandbox or

747
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:08,320
you need to set up your own customized

748
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:11,279
server to load the malware sometimes

749
00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:13,360
you know as like virus total or even the

750
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:14,880
google sandbox

751
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:18,159
yeah it can analyze some common

752
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:21,360
uh file type like executable but

753
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:23,360
when you do some kind of very customized

754
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:25,440
or highly target

755
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:26,799
attack you need to set up your own

756
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:30,320
server to to analyze it about it

757
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:33,120
okay so that means it's uh very resource

758
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:34,559
intensive right

759
00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:36,399
but yeah if you have sufficient

760
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:38,880
resources then of course it's uh

761
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:41,679
suggests to do so right

762
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:44,480
and after that when you do the analysis

763
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:46,399
you can write the java rules with the

764
00:29:46,399 --> 00:29:49,440
artifacts that can help you to identify

765
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:51,039
the other

766
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:55,360
potential backdoor surface as well right

767
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:56,960
and

768
00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:00,159
for a more uh quick and dirty way to do

769
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:02,960
the analysis on the back door we will

770
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:05,840
recommend these three so first we have

771
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:08,960
the similarity analysis so basically uh

772
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:10,320
you can

773
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:12,799
compare the suspicious file with the

774
00:30:12,799 --> 00:30:15,919
published batter using some algorithms

775
00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:19,600
like uh similarly check with lsh or

776
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:23,120
maybe just do a binary differencing

777
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:25,360
another way is to do a string and

778
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:27,840
frequency analysis so basically you

779
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:30,080
extract the string from the suspicious

780
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:30,960
file

781
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:32,799
then you can try to figure out whether

782
00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:34,399
there's some

783
00:30:34,399 --> 00:30:37,039
hidden commands or maybe the c2 surface

784
00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:40,640
address or some suspicious uh

785
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:43,120
strings

786
00:30:43,279 --> 00:30:46,799
and uh in some cases uh the binary may

787
00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:50,240
be uh encrypted or patented then in this

788
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:51,840
case you may need to do an entropy

789
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:54,880
analysis to compare the distribution of

790
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:57,200
different objects to see whether it's an

791
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:59,520
obfuscated one

792
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:01,840
so ken i think you are the expert in

793
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:03,679
this area so uh

794
00:31:03,679 --> 00:31:05,440
what kind of skills or what thing you

795
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:07,120
need to be

796
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:09,279
aware of when you do this kind of

797
00:31:09,279 --> 00:31:11,600
analysis

798
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:14,159
from general speaking i think a large

799
00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:16,640
database is the key point to be

800
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:18,720
successful successful to do this type of

801
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:21,360
similarity matching as your database if

802
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:23,279
your database is sufficiently large you

803
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:25,600
will have a higher house to hit the hit

804
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:27,360
a similar

805
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:29,919
i would say similar samples and another

806
00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:31,200
point of

807
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:33,600
successful to be successful for doing

808
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,840
simulator similarity analysis would be a

809
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:37,679
better tool for example

810
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:40,399
i may i would highly i recommend to use

811
00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:41,200
the

812
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:43,600
function sim hash by google project zero

813
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:44,559
it is

814
00:31:44,559 --> 00:31:46,960
i think it is pretty rare in doing some

815
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:48,640
matching though you may need to play

816
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:50,720
with the configuration to make it

817
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:54,080
uh more robust by case i guess in

818
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:55,440
general we didn't use a different

819
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:57,679
configuration but we can hear some

820
00:31:57,679 --> 00:32:00,880
uh interesting samples with these tricks

821
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:03,360
yes this is this is pretty robust and

822
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:05,200
another model we may consider to look

823
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:07,120
like maybe the magic map

824
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:09,919
again by google again uh this is this

825
00:32:09,919 --> 00:32:12,159
model being evaluated recently in the

826
00:32:12,159 --> 00:32:13,840
academic conference and the results

827
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:16,480
pretty well and i i have similar

828
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:18,640
experiments on working on these models

829
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:21,519
and i guess the resources match with how

830
00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:23,519
cisco talos results yeah i think this

831
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:25,120
role model is robust

832
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:27,440
but for if you want robust you need a

833
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:29,679
large database at first yes and the

834
00:32:29,679 --> 00:32:31,600
large database you need to gather some

835
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:32,640
latest

836
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:35,360
samples like from the trader or from

837
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:38,080
from some public malware repository but

838
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:40,000
however they didn't do the

839
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,480
classification for yourself or you can

840
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:44,240
reach enough then you can subscribe from

841
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:46,480
virustotal but there's no label about

842
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:49,120
that door as a label of a bad word as a

843
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:52,000
classification so that's why you need

844
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,559
you need to classify or to have to dump

845
00:32:54,559 --> 00:32:57,120
to prepare a large database as well or

846
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:59,360
to get from like from the twitter i see

847
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:02,320
some um twitter account to share some

848
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:05,360
latest malware samples so that's why

849
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:08,480
also to how to set up your database with

850
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:10,559
the malware samples for similarity

851
00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:12,000
analysis

852
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,760
yeah so you can see

853
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:15,360
for instance respond it doesn't mean

854
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:17,600
that whenever there's incidents then you

855
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:20,240
do things you need to prepare first

856
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:22,840
otherwise you cannot do things

857
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:28,080
fast okay so besides the bad. file you

858
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:31,360
also want to look at the backdoor server

859
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:33,919
or some server that you think that is

860
00:33:33,919 --> 00:33:36,720
under attack or being compromised

861
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:38,640
so how can you uh

862
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:40,559
check whether the server is compromised

863
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:42,960
usually you can

864
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:44,880
compare the configuration file which is

865
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:47,120
also suggested by the experts so you

866
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:49,519
need to first prepare the golden copy of

867
00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:51,519
the configuration file so that's the

868
00:33:51,519 --> 00:33:54,320
original copy and then compare it with

869
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:55,360
the

870
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:57,279
deployed one

871
00:33:57,279 --> 00:34:00,559
but yeah ellen uh i think

872
00:34:00,559 --> 00:34:03,279
you also do this and you've found that

873
00:34:03,279 --> 00:34:05,760
the surface still surface suspicious why

874
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:07,919
is that the case

875
00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:08,960
yeah

876
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:10,960
normally of course a golden copy would

877
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:13,760
be the best idea however as you can see

878
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,599
from our case

879
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:17,440
the engineers thought that it was the

880
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:19,599
golden cop but however the configuring

881
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:22,560
files firewall was actually corrupted so

882
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:25,839
whenever they try to store the new new

883
00:34:25,839 --> 00:34:28,399
new servers from the old from the

884
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:30,079
holding copy actually they actually

885
00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:31,199
restore the

886
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:33,280
infected things as well as you can see

887
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:35,679
the configuration file which is actually

888
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:38,719
loading the malware as well

889
00:34:38,719 --> 00:34:41,359
so for this case

890
00:34:41,359 --> 00:34:43,440
it cannot be done by just simply

891
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:46,079
comparing the configuration file it

892
00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:47,280
would not be

893
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:49,520
sufficient

894
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:50,560
yeah

895
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:53,119
so that's one tricky point you may want

896
00:34:53,119 --> 00:34:53,839
to

897
00:34:53,839 --> 00:34:56,480
be aware of so especially when you have

898
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:57,280
these

899
00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:00,320
insiders doing bad things right

900
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:03,119
and the other point would be uh

901
00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:05,280
you also want to examine the activity

902
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:08,640
and the error loss of the header server

903
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:09,920
to detect whether there's some

904
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:11,599
successful or

905
00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:14,079
failed

906
00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:16,960
external program or modules

907
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:20,000
and we also want to uh

908
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:23,440
dump the watertown memory in some cases

909
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:25,359
so for example uh

910
00:35:25,359 --> 00:35:29,760
if the better surfer is doing some

911
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:32,560
very stealthy operations like after they

912
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:35,200
start up the surface they have another

913
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:37,440
flowerless malware plant inside the

914
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:41,280
server then in that case you need to

915
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:43,680
dump the memory to do the analysis but i

916
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:45,920
think in our case we didn't do this

917
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:47,760
because it's a

918
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:52,640
the battle is planned on the iis module

919
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:55,280
and then after that uh once you identify

920
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:57,680
the battle server you can continue to do

921
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:58,880
the

922
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:01,280
string analysis to identify more

923
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:02,640
suspicious

924
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:05,759
string and commands

925
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,880
so last but not least you also want to

926
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:11,119
look at the network traffic

927
00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:13,760
so first uh you want to uh

928
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:16,000
identify what is the normal traffic

929
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,560
patterns like doing the benchmarking on

930
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:21,760
the common requests and response headers

931
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:25,040
and then you can also uh look at those

932
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:27,119
traffic with a

933
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:30,160
suspicious pattern like a high volume or

934
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:33,119
from ips gestation not popular

935
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:35,599
but you can see that uh the prerequisite

936
00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:38,960
of doing these tools activity is to have

937
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:41,359
an siem right

938
00:36:41,359 --> 00:36:42,960
so ellen uh

939
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:45,359
what if we don't have an siem in the

940
00:36:45,359 --> 00:36:48,000
organization what should we do

941
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,320
yeah back to a few years i thought that

942
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:52,720
there wasn't any sin so by that time we

943
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:54,640
just export all the laws from the

944
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:57,200
windows server and the ssl vpn log from

945
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:59,440
the firewall devices so

946
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:01,839
we could we could read the loss but it

947
00:37:01,839 --> 00:37:04,560
took much time

948
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:07,839
okay yeah so that means that you need to

949
00:37:07,839 --> 00:37:10,400
drill down to each server to look at the

950
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:13,520
loss instead of having the centralized

951
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:16,079
siem to view the load and do the

952
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:18,720
analysis quickly right so you can still

953
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:20,640
do the investigation and instance

954
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:22,960
respond but yeah it's a

955
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:25,920
slower so that's why be better prepared

956
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:28,720
before the incidents come

957
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:30,640
and after that uh once you have

958
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:33,119
identified this suspicious traffic you

959
00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:33,920
can

960
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:35,599
write another network traffic search

961
00:37:35,599 --> 00:37:36,800
group

962
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:39,200
so uh i think we already have a java

963
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:41,599
rules before for the backdoor so anthony

964
00:37:41,599 --> 00:37:44,320
why do we want to have a network traffic

965
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:46,960
search ruler

966
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:48,839
well first of all

967
00:37:48,839 --> 00:37:51,440
actually ken told me that the rules is

968
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:53,359
written by the people

969
00:37:53,359 --> 00:37:55,520
and if you depends

970
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:57,920
on the someone why the rules then you

971
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:00,320
will miss some important points

972
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:02,560
so that's why you need to check it out

973
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:04,640
different patterns by yourself to

974
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:07,200
manually to to be will as well to set up

975
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:08,640
your own rules and write your own rules

976
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:10,880
to detect it based on the backdoor or

977
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:13,119
some kind of business logic or on

978
00:38:13,119 --> 00:38:16,000
business context or for example some

979
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:19,280
specific keywords or some specific

980
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:22,000
functions or label

981
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,240
variable names you need to make it

982
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:26,160
otherwise if you simply just take other

983
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:28,240
one rules to detect it sometimes you

984
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:30,720
miss it so that's why we need to

985
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:32,880
draft our own rules

986
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:35,599
yes so that's why we propose so many

987
00:38:35,599 --> 00:38:37,680
different steps in here

988
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:41,040
one major purpose is to uh triangulate

989
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:44,000
so because uh whenever there's some uh

990
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:47,200
indicators that doesn't mean that is a

991
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:49,440
bad door or not right you need to have a

992
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:50,480
multiple

993
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:53,200
uh incidence of evidence to see whether

994
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:54,320
it's a

995
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:56,320
positive or negative

996
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:58,480
and of course if you are capable enough

997
00:38:58,480 --> 00:38:59,920
you can also do the network traffic

998
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:02,560
decryption or the obfuscation especially

999
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:05,119
if you have a complete analysis of the

1000
00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:07,520
malware

1001
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:10,320
okay in conclusion we have discussed

1002
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:11,119
this

1003
00:39:11,119 --> 00:39:13,760
realistic case and based on this case we

1004
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:16,480
propose a playbook that uh integrate uh

1005
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:19,359
different existing solutions and we also

1006
00:39:19,359 --> 00:39:22,079
propose equiforms and uh

1007
00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:24,800
instance response matrix to help the

1008
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:27,119
practitioners to do a

1009
00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:30,320
fast faster instance respawn

1010
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:32,720
so in this case actually the typical ir

1011
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:35,040
is still useful but yeah

1012
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:38,240
maybe uh not for the battle

1013
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:40,560
and some experts also suggest we have

1014
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:41,520
this

1015
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:43,680
compression of the configuration file

1016
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:44,800
but yeah

1017
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:47,040
sometimes uh it didn't work because of

1018
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:49,040
the insider

1019
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:51,839
okay uh that's all for the presentation

1020
00:39:51,839 --> 00:39:53,599
thank you for your attention
