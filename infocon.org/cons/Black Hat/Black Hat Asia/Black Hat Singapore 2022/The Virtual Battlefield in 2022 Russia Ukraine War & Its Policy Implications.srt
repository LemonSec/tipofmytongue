1
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:03,720
[Music]

2
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:06,720
foreign

3
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:10,800
thank you so much for attending it is a

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,980
real honor to be here and talk about I

5
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:16,980
think a very important uh topic and

6
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:18,539
hopefully numerous topics I think

7
00:00:18,539 --> 00:00:21,359
because this is a strategic issue you

8
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:22,980
know that affects not only domestic

9
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:25,800
politics but international relations and

10
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:28,740
human rights uh Etc I work for a company

11
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:30,119
called very good security that's not

12
00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:32,340
important what is important though is

13
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:35,040
half of our companies in Ukraine so some

14
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:37,320
of you also may have employees in

15
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:39,540
Ukraine and so then you know how

16
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:41,700
difficult a time this has been and the

17
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:44,219
questions that it raises for not only

18
00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:46,680
security but really the very lives of

19
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:49,320
your employees

20
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:52,620
so just this little suffice as a CV I'm

21
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:55,320
a pretty lucky cyber analyst I was in

22
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:59,520
Estonia in 2007 for the Russian Cyber

23
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:03,260
attack against the movement of a statue

24
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:08,460
from estonia's Capital Center and I was

25
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:11,340
in Ukraine in 2014. I taught a cyber

26
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:13,680
security class at the University in Kiev

27
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:17,340
and I did a book for for NATO on the

28
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:19,439
Cyber dimension of the Russia Ukraine

29
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:23,100
crisis hence here as a speaker and I

30
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:24,780
also just happened to meet when I was a

31
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:27,659
student back in 1992 randomly in front

32
00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:30,479
of the White House Boris Yeltsin the

33
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:35,040
person who put Vladimir Putin into power

34
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:38,520
so let's look a little bit about uh what

35
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:42,119
is cyber war is it a thing or not uh if

36
00:01:42,119 --> 00:01:45,119
you just look at the Sue bookends of

37
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:48,420
this crisis the first invasion in 2014

38
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:53,100
uh and the second invasion of Ukraine uh

39
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:56,640
by Russia on this year you can see how

40
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:59,520
chaotic cyberspace is and numerous

41
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,500
events have taken place during that time

42
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:05,820
that we would call cyber War uh or what

43
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:08,220
what we think or the most powerful cyber

44
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:10,038
attacks we have seen to date

45
00:02:10,038 --> 00:02:13,860
the power grid attack on on 2015 on

46
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:16,379
Christmas which was reiterated one year

47
00:02:16,379 --> 00:02:19,200
later on 2016 you could also add the

48
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:22,379
hack of the democratic party uh that led

49
00:02:22,379 --> 00:02:24,900
to help lead to Donald Trump being in

50
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:26,580
the White House and that also has been

51
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:28,980
attributed to the gru or Russian

52
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:32,040
military intelligence which makes you

53
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:34,080
have to think okay how are they using

54
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:37,379
hacking against politics in America the

55
00:02:37,379 --> 00:02:39,959
Russian military that makes you think

56
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:42,420
that this is a national security issue

57
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:46,280
for them right this is a military issue

58
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:49,440
politics in various regions of the world

59
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,900
and of course in in Ukraine and you

60
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:53,700
probably know but even Vladimir Putin

61
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:55,739
has called Kiev the mother of all

62
00:02:55,739 --> 00:02:58,920
Russian cities right so why are they so

63
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,120
interested

64
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:02,580
okay many things happening but let's say

65
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:05,160
that peace time in cyberspace is a

66
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:07,920
pretty chaotic environment with a lot

67
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,399
going on

68
00:03:10,739 --> 00:03:15,659
so about Ukraine war this year I don't

69
00:03:15,659 --> 00:03:17,220
think the question really is about

70
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:18,360
Ukraine

71
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:21,180
I don't even think it's about Russia

72
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:25,440
it's about Putin right it's about an old

73
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:28,739
man trying to stay in power uh and we

74
00:03:28,739 --> 00:03:30,180
have to face up to the facts this is

75
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:31,739
real

76
00:03:31,739 --> 00:03:34,200
so people want they want Better Health

77
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:36,000
Care they want better education better

78
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,599
infrastructure for the country and that

79
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:40,860
doesn't matter whether you're in Moscow

80
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:42,780
or Washington DC

81
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:46,799
or elsewhere so we can see here's uh you

82
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:50,280
know pro-democracy protests in Russia uh

83
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:54,180
Ukraine Belarus 2020. uh even this year

84
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:57,540
in Kazakhstan right that governments put

85
00:03:57,540 --> 00:04:01,200
down through autocracy and that includes

86
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:04,440
computer network operations right of an

87
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:07,980
internal kind meant to suppress dissent

88
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:12,200
and to uh project power

89
00:04:12,299 --> 00:04:15,420
so when I was living in in Kiev in 2014

90
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:18,478
to 2017 I taught a class at the

91
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:21,540
University in Kiev and uh two of the

92
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:24,240
chapters were written by uh Ukrainian

93
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:27,060
government folks and they covered the

94
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:30,300
cyber attacks during the uh

95
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:34,380
um the Euro maidan events of of 2014 and

96
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:36,120
here just some of the things and we're

97
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,560
going to see them

98
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:41,940
not only in 2014 but in 2022 things like

99
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:44,759
web defacements then leading into denial

100
00:04:44,759 --> 00:04:46,100
of service

101
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:50,220
doxing and uh

102
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:54,840
and more depending on the temperature in

103
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:56,940
the geopolitical space right so the

104
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:58,560
cyber attacks or computer network

105
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,540
operations tend to mirror what's

106
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:03,419
happening in traditional space so the

107
00:05:03,419 --> 00:05:05,400
closer you get to an election the more

108
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:07,620
malware you see and this is true in

109
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:10,979
Texas as it is in Australia as it is in

110
00:05:10,979 --> 00:05:13,139
Russia right so I spent a two and a half

111
00:05:13,139 --> 00:05:15,180
years recently for doing data science

112
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:18,919
for a malware detection company and

113
00:05:18,919 --> 00:05:22,500
geopolitics are absolutely a magnet for

114
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:25,160
malware no matter where you live right

115
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:28,500
so that was a cert UA chapter and you

116
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:31,100
can see the Russian military specific

117
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:34,560
attacks are more aggressive so they're

118
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:37,259
you know taking over satellite you know

119
00:05:37,259 --> 00:05:39,660
control centers cutting cables

120
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:42,180
physically and then moving into the

121
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:43,860
softer space but stuff that does require

122
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:46,560
more intelligence and more forethought

123
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:49,139
stuff like whitewashing Wikipedia right

124
00:05:49,139 --> 00:05:51,060
of stuff of information you don't like

125
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:52,740
and inserting information in there

126
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:55,320
trying to that that supports your

127
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:56,580
political program

128
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:59,400
and again so I'll just mention uh that

129
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,620
when I talk to my students in kievit

130
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:02,940
University I used to ask them

131
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:04,380
occasionally because we're talking about

132
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:05,699
all these issues

133
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:08,160
I would say do you feel like in your

134
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:12,240
personal social media space that you

135
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:15,240
sends the impact and the penetration of

136
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:17,100
Kremlin propaganda

137
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:19,860
and every time every hand would go up

138
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:22,919
right so that's the power of information

139
00:06:22,919 --> 00:06:26,220
operations on the web is you know even

140
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:28,620
you know students admittedly these are

141
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:30,479
students at a nice University but still

142
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:33,000
uh it's important that propaganda does

143
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,560
work it does does reach

144
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:39,360
so this I I want to

145
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:42,419
um all first of all one of my wife and I

146
00:06:42,419 --> 00:06:43,979
would go on long walks we live in Brazil

147
00:06:43,979 --> 00:06:45,120
now and one of the things we were

148
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,160
talking about just before the war was

149
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:49,139
this war is not going to go well for

150
00:06:49,139 --> 00:06:50,699
Russia

151
00:06:50,699 --> 00:06:54,360
Ukraine is huge and there's just basic

152
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:58,380
geography will tell you that 150 000

153
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:01,020
troops was nowhere close to the number

154
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:03,900
of people you would need to occupy such

155
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:06,180
a large space

156
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:09,479
so in this case in in 2015 on the

157
00:07:09,479 --> 00:07:11,160
Christmas hack

158
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,240
um

159
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,979
here's what what I want you to think

160
00:07:13,979 --> 00:07:15,360
about is

161
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:18,660
the tanks and the troops are bogged down

162
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:21,180
in the donbass which is you know Far

163
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:26,360
Eastern Ukraine Daniels lugonsk

164
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:29,520
cyber attacks give you a different kind

165
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:32,460
of tool a different kind of weapon to

166
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:35,160
reach far beyond the battlefield so

167
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:36,960
think about 2016 as well the the

168
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,940
election attack in the United States

169
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:42,300
right no troops or tanks were there but

170
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:45,780
yet it was a powerful Testament to what

171
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:48,060
you can do with hacking and doxing right

172
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:50,819
so in this case uh it was actually an

173
00:07:50,819 --> 00:07:53,039
attack on an electricity grid the Lights

174
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:57,360
Went Out in Western Ukraine

175
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:00,479
it's not in the same physical space

176
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:02,340
and it's not even the same logical space

177
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:05,520
right it just affects civilians uh but

178
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,919
it's over on the Polish border on the on

179
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:09,960
the NATO border right so there's just a

180
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:11,759
number of things to think about that the

181
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:14,340
sort of hackers hacker tools and tactics

182
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:17,099
they give you another weapon another

183
00:08:17,099 --> 00:08:19,979
kind of weapon that you can use in a

184
00:08:19,979 --> 00:08:21,780
different time and space and of course

185
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:24,240
this is in between the two invasions

186
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:27,860
gives you opportunity to attack

187
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:30,599
silently in peacetime

188
00:08:30,599 --> 00:08:32,700
I guess one more Point here is that a

189
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:34,020
lot of hacking if you want to be ready

190
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:36,059
for war has to be done in peace time

191
00:08:36,059 --> 00:08:38,339
right so that's one of the ironies this

192
00:08:38,339 --> 00:08:39,899
and international relations they call it

193
00:08:39,899 --> 00:08:42,299
the security dilemma the more I prepare

194
00:08:42,299 --> 00:08:44,640
for war the more that's going to

195
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:47,339
frighten my neighbors right and so so in

196
00:08:47,339 --> 00:08:48,660
part like what's happening in Germany

197
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:50,519
right now so Germany decided it's going

198
00:08:50,519 --> 00:08:53,399
to you know triple its investment in uh

199
00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:56,040
military equipment right and troops

200
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:58,019
because of the changing Dynamic

201
00:08:58,019 --> 00:09:00,360
international relations but that's going

202
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:02,279
to have knock-on effects right in in

203
00:09:02,279 --> 00:09:04,620
Holland and France and and in elsewhere

204
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:07,980
so it's just it's inevitable right

205
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:10,740
um which is which is dangerous

206
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:15,300
so this is a reminder to us all that

207
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:17,519
um you know traditional power is not

208
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:20,640
decisive right if you think traditional

209
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,260
power in terms of I've got this many

210
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:24,180
tanks this many ships

211
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:25,019
Etc

212
00:09:25,019 --> 00:09:27,839
Ukraine is winning the battle of the

213
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:31,320
Black Sea with a grand total of zero

214
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:35,220
ships today right how is that possible

215
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:38,700
it's possible you know Napoleon said the

216
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:41,399
the moral is to the physical is three is

217
00:09:41,399 --> 00:09:42,899
to one

218
00:09:42,899 --> 00:09:45,660
right so

219
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:48,660
saying that the defense has all kinds of

220
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:51,480
uh advantages that the offense doesn't I

221
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:53,760
think even even in cyberspace I mean you

222
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,640
can set up honey pots you can set up you

223
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:57,300
know

224
00:09:57,300 --> 00:10:00,600
um tricks and traps that if you do them

225
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:03,660
in a unique way the attacker will really

226
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:05,880
be fooled I think

227
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:09,000
um but all I want to say here is that

228
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,279
you can have the United States found

229
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:14,220
this out in Afghanistan and in Vietnam

230
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:17,880
and in Iraq right you can win every

231
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:19,860
battle and still lose the war and people

232
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:24,200
have been learning that lesson forever

233
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,580
cyberpower is a bit different right it

234
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:28,080
gives you

235
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:32,580
a very elusive way to fight right we're

236
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:35,459
talking information operations here

237
00:10:35,459 --> 00:10:36,060
um

238
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:38,040
information operations is a big topic

239
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:40,860
right I think uh if we talk computer

240
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:44,279
network operations there's three basic

241
00:10:44,279 --> 00:10:46,560
kinds of attack right I can pull off I

242
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,060
can steal your information in other

243
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:49,800
words I can read your email

244
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:52,560
I can deny you access to information in

245
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,600
other words I can stop you from reading

246
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:58,079
your email or most uh alarmingly perhaps

247
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:00,420
to you I could change your email right I

248
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:02,640
could say don't meet the your contact at

249
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:07,140
midnight but meet them at noon right

250
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:08,399
um and that's the most dangerous but I

251
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:10,800
do think that those are the as you get

252
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,540
across that Spectrum

253
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:16,620
they get rarer right so above all the

254
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:18,120
internet is about collecting information

255
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:20,640
disseminating information and as we're

256
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:23,640
about to see that is more important than

257
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:26,399
the more exotic and esoteric attacks

258
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:28,019
which it takes so much time and effort

259
00:11:28,019 --> 00:11:31,260
and are likely to be of a temporary uh

260
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:34,579
win type of nature

261
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:38,700
so here on this timeline you can see

262
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:40,860
the kinds of things that a military

263
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:44,040
would do to prepare the battle space for

264
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:46,740
victory right so strategic intelligence

265
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:48,899
happens all the time right so Microsoft

266
00:11:48,899 --> 00:11:50,279
put out this report a couple weeks ago

267
00:11:50,279 --> 00:11:52,380
I'm sure you saw it saying that well

268
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:54,480
over a year in advance

269
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:57,180
this these hacker teams at the Gru and

270
00:11:57,180 --> 00:12:00,000
in another they actually mentioned three

271
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,060
um apts or advanced persistent threats

272
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:05,700
um and within those three agencies even

273
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:09,839
subgroups so six apts right uh and at

274
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:12,420
least eight malware families but these

275
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:13,980
are busy all the time collecting

276
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:16,380
information collecting information

277
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:19,019
um and that's part of life right

278
00:12:19,019 --> 00:12:21,720
as the approach as the troops are

279
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:24,420
amassing on the border uh the web

280
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:27,959
defacements become uh visible right so

281
00:12:27,959 --> 00:12:30,480
in Ukrainian and polish and in Russian

282
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,700
there's a lot of web defacements against

283
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:34,980
Ukrainian government infrastructure in

284
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:39,540
January and February warning right of uh

285
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:44,279
of a threat right to to Ukraine

286
00:12:44,279 --> 00:12:46,740
and you could say well as the attacks

287
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:48,300
get more serious

288
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:50,639
you as a Defender and that's why you

289
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:52,620
know on your your network security teams

290
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:54,180
it's good to have a traditional

291
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:56,459
intelligence analyst right so who's not

292
00:12:56,459 --> 00:12:58,680
just doing hacking or anti-hacking but

293
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:01,200
who can read the newspaper every day and

294
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,420
kind of be aware of what's happening in

295
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:04,620
the world

296
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:09,420
that might bring malware your way

297
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:12,959
okay so about 10 days before the actual

298
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:14,940
Invasion and The Invasion took place on

299
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:17,279
February 24th

300
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:20,220
DDOS attacks and these are sort of the

301
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:23,880
you know the um the maybe the aerial

302
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:27,779
suppression sort of uh

303
00:13:27,779 --> 00:13:32,040
analogy in cyber attacks right the

304
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:35,100
bombers or the jet fighters are you know

305
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:36,839
trying to take out the missiles trying

306
00:13:36,839 --> 00:13:39,480
to take out the air defense Etc

307
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:41,940
um so about 10 days before and

308
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:43,980
specifically focused on the Ukrainian

309
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:45,060
government

310
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:47,579
DDOS attacks which according to the

311
00:13:47,579 --> 00:13:49,500
Ukrainian government with the largest it

312
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:52,200
had ever seen so these are meant to

313
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:55,019
probably intimidate as well but also to

314
00:13:55,019 --> 00:13:58,860
confuse to raise the uh let the amount

315
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:04,519
of fog in the uh in war

316
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:07,560
then on the 23rd of February and the

317
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:09,660
24th of February there were new wipers

318
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:12,959
that were seen right and these are like

319
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:15,839
maybe artillery right so as you as you

320
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:17,399
if you're reading the news now in

321
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:18,959
eastern Ukraine

322
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:21,480
artillery will come in for a while right

323
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:24,660
and try and kill uh and frighten

324
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:26,459
everyone and then the troops will try

325
00:14:26,459 --> 00:14:29,160
and Advance right so you can think about

326
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:31,380
the wipers when these coming in on the

327
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:33,839
23rd of February the 24th of February uh

328
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:35,579
and you're familiar I guess from 2017

329
00:14:35,579 --> 00:14:37,680
with not petya attack right that's a

330
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:41,279
wiper I come in I wipe your data and

331
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:43,380
then I destroy the boot record on your

332
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:44,820
computer so all of a sudden your

333
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:47,040
computer sitting here is a paperweight

334
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:48,600
right can't really do anything with it

335
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:51,300
actually an expert has to come in and

336
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:54,300
rebuild your computer rebuild the data

337
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:56,820
right and that takes time and effort

338
00:14:56,820 --> 00:14:59,820
so so that's you know you know things

339
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:02,040
are probably getting serious if your

340
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:05,339
agency or your your institution or your

341
00:15:05,339 --> 00:15:07,920
country uh is is

342
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:10,260
um is under attack

343
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:12,959
by a wiper

344
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:15,540
and then as the troops cross the border

345
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:18,779
uh we see psychological operations uh

346
00:15:18,779 --> 00:15:22,440
start and um before I describe that uh

347
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:24,180
in any more detail I'll just say that I

348
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:26,760
just have one slide on each of these uh

349
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:30,660
DDOS computer wiping and psychological

350
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:32,100
operations

351
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:34,800
so this is the intelligence headquarters

352
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:37,500
in Kiev and I was super lucky you know

353
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:39,300
yeah as a foreigner there I live just

354
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:41,579
just to the left of this building and

355
00:15:41,579 --> 00:15:43,260
then the university is just to the right

356
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:44,519
of this building if you know you know

357
00:15:44,519 --> 00:15:46,380
Kia if you know what I'm talking about

358
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:48,240
and so I got to live on this street you

359
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:50,940
know and enjoy uh beautiful uh my Dawn

360
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:52,500
and beautiful Kiev and thank goodness

361
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:54,540
that it hasn't been destroyed right

362
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:57,540
during this War uh because it's a

363
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:59,639
beautiful historic city

364
00:15:59,639 --> 00:16:01,019
um and you might not even know this but

365
00:16:01,019 --> 00:16:03,899
just just uh maybe behind a little on

366
00:16:03,899 --> 00:16:07,079
the right is the Opera and the Opera in

367
00:16:07,079 --> 00:16:10,800
1917 is where karensky the uh the

368
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:13,920
Russian politician was murdered in 1917

369
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:17,880
as the uh Bolshevik Revolution uh was

370
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:21,600
taking hold in in St Petersburg so very

371
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:24,540
famous street uh and you know

372
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:27,000
um intimately tied with Russian politics

373
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,940
you know 100 years ago as it is today

374
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:32,100
but in the DDOS what you can see is

375
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:34,740
these are really focused on Ukrainian

376
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:37,500
government right again largest DDOS ever

377
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:41,820
for 10 days and attribution or or saying

378
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:44,220
who's responsible for an attack is often

379
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:46,079
very slow and tedious and uncertain I

380
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:48,380
was in in Estonia in 2007

381
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:51,240
and still even to this day who did it

382
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:53,639
right it's still who done it really sort

383
00:16:53,639 --> 00:16:57,300
of episode of all those DDOS attacks

384
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:59,100
um because

385
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:00,380
you know

386
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:02,940
you know Estonia was hey there's Russia

387
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:05,520
who's Russia you know but you know

388
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,079
where's there's no there's been no

389
00:17:07,079 --> 00:17:09,720
conviction you know no no arrest Etc you

390
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:11,819
see my point in this case in February

391
00:17:11,819 --> 00:17:14,819
18th the White House came out with a

392
00:17:14,819 --> 00:17:17,220
report at a briefing at the white house

393
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:21,260
uh Jen saki right she said

394
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:25,679
known technical Gru infrastructure we

395
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:27,359
have associated with this attack in

396
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:29,460
other words attribution is Russian not

397
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:31,320
just Russia but Russian military

398
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:35,540
intelligence right so that's important

399
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:38,700
so I have two candidates for the biggest

400
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:41,460
hack in this war right and so this is

401
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:43,380
the first one

402
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:45,960
on February 24th

403
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:49,340
um now we know that this hack took place

404
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:52,919
one hour before Russian troops crossed

405
00:17:52,919 --> 00:17:55,799
the border one hour right so again one

406
00:17:55,799 --> 00:17:58,380
of your if you all do analysis on on

407
00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:01,440
malware even in a tactical sense one of

408
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:04,080
your best friends is a timeline right so

409
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:05,880
start putting together a timeline of

410
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:08,460
what you see on your network right it

411
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:10,640
just you know detected malware here

412
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:13,260
detected malware here

413
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:16,080
what can you coordinate or correlate

414
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:18,179
with the with those events that happened

415
00:18:18,179 --> 00:18:21,240
in you know VIP Travel or the

416
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:23,880
installation of new uh

417
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:25,919
product line or something like that at

418
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:27,900
your company

419
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:30,840
in any case one hour before Russian

420
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:33,240
troops cross the border

421
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:37,080
um via sat via

422
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:39,600
malicious firmware update which is

423
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:43,220
another huge indicator right uh red flag

424
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:46,020
saying that these hackers whoever it is

425
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:48,740
really know what they're doing right

426
00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:51,620
malicious firmware update

427
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:55,260
affects user modems across Europe all

428
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:57,840
the way from Ukraine to Morocco so this

429
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:00,000
is similar to not petya right with so

430
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,220
much collateral damage

431
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:03,780
um around

432
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:05,460
but one hour before the troops crossed

433
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:07,820
the border

434
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:13,080
satellite modems in Ukraine unusable

435
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:16,260
bricked so again these things have to be

436
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:20,340
physically replaced by vsat right so

437
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:21,419
according to the Ukrainian government

438
00:19:21,419 --> 00:19:24,360
this was a huge comms loss and just on

439
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:26,880
May 10th so a couple of days ago the

440
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,880
United States government

441
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:31,919
published a report UK government as well

442
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:34,860
as the EU saying this was Russia and

443
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:37,140
saying that it was targeting Russian

444
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:40,679
military command and control right so a

445
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:44,220
very specific attack against a strategic

446
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:46,260
Target and if you listen to what the

447
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:48,419
ukrainians are saying this had a major

448
00:19:48,419 --> 00:19:51,299
impact on

449
00:19:51,299 --> 00:19:53,940
defending the country so candidate

450
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:56,700
number one right for

451
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:57,440
um

452
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:01,740
strategic cyber war attack

453
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:02,400
um

454
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:05,400
with potentially decisive right

455
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:07,260
hopefully from the attacker's

456
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:11,820
perspective decisive uh impact

457
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:13,320
so here's a little bit more on the

458
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:15,960
wipers what I want to say here is that

459
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:19,860
you want allies in cyberspace right so

460
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:22,260
think about it when you have Microsoft

461
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:25,320
and ESET and many many others

462
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:29,640
coming to your defense right uh so in

463
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:32,400
this fight Ukraine has not been alone I

464
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:33,900
think there's a common understanding of

465
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:35,700
who the aggressor is

466
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:38,100
uh in this fight and there have been so

467
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:41,220
many people to stand up uh and support

468
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:44,160
Ukraine in very in various ways

469
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:46,200
so in this case you can see uh ESET

470
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:48,900
Slovakian company I think based in San

471
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:50,280
Diego now

472
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:52,380
you know basically coming out you know

473
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:55,620
with an important report on the day of

474
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:58,559
in this case prior to the attack and

475
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:01,080
then explaining in detail not only the

476
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:03,120
indicators of compromise and the type of

477
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:06,539
attack but also how to uh

478
00:21:06,539 --> 00:21:10,020
how to best defend against it

479
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:12,780
so psychological operations kind of came

480
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:15,419
in as the troops crossed the border and

481
00:21:15,419 --> 00:21:17,820
look at this so it can be pinpoint

482
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:21,960
propaganda pinpoint targeting of

483
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:24,740
um victims and targets so in this case

484
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:29,159
soldiers might get a

485
00:21:29,159 --> 00:21:33,659
a text that says you know swap sides you

486
00:21:33,659 --> 00:21:36,659
know one of them she's the woman in this

487
00:21:36,659 --> 00:21:38,820
photo she's holding up a machine and it

488
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:40,440
says that

489
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:44,159
um when the snow melts they will find

490
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:46,919
your body in the snow

491
00:21:46,919 --> 00:21:49,500
right so they're meant to frighten

492
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:52,860
intimidate Etc soldiers received that

493
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:54,360
citizens receive something different

494
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:56,400
citizens received hey did you know that

495
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,039
the ATMs in the country are not working

496
00:21:58,039 --> 00:22:01,919
right so this is uh again causing panic

497
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:04,020
this is the thing from Estonia in 2007

498
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:05,880
the biggest single aspect I think to

499
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:09,720
that attack was that the um the banking

500
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:11,460
infrastructure was knocked offline for a

501
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:13,140
couple of hours right so then the

502
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:14,760
question is could a couple of hours have

503
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:16,020
been a couple of days or a couple of

504
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:17,700
weeks and then how long does it take

505
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:19,140
before you have a national security

506
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:21,659
crisis on your hands if people can't as

507
00:22:21,659 --> 00:22:23,880
the estonians put it by you know eggs

508
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:26,159
and bread

509
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:28,080
government workers were receiving yet

510
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:30,659
another message that asked them to

511
00:22:30,659 --> 00:22:33,240
switch their allegiance from Ukraine to

512
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:35,640
Russia right so

513
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:37,679
that obviously has not happened I think

514
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:39,000
you know the Russians vastly

515
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,940
overestimated their appeal especially

516
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:43,860
among Russian speakers turns out Russian

517
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:46,919
is just a language right it is not a

518
00:22:46,919 --> 00:22:49,159
political allegiance

519
00:22:49,159 --> 00:22:51,980
we can see hacked social media and TV

520
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:55,500
hacked uh Ukrainian military Facebook

521
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:59,059
accounts seeing of senior leaders

522
00:22:59,059 --> 00:23:01,760
asking the troops to surrender

523
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:05,159
zelenski asking uh the country to

524
00:23:05,159 --> 00:23:08,580
surrender in a deep fake right so these

525
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:11,280
are operations that are you know the

526
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:13,140
attacker at least hopes are going to

527
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:15,960
have a strategic impact uh and one of

528
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:17,880
the things that you can do is try and

529
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:19,679
educate your citizens your employees

530
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:22,860
about about deep fakes and about

531
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:26,059
information operations

532
00:23:27,179 --> 00:23:29,820
here is candidate number two for our

533
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:33,179
biggest hack of the War uh at least thus

534
00:23:33,179 --> 00:23:35,700
far right so

535
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:37,860
here you can see you know you've got

536
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:39,320
Russia

537
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:42,960
Belarus and Ukraine and one of the

538
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:45,299
things this is pretty strategic I think

539
00:23:45,299 --> 00:23:52,158
that that in 2020 uh when a young woman

540
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:55,440
won the election right in Belarus but

541
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:57,059
was forced out of the country and

542
00:23:57,059 --> 00:23:58,919
basically the pro-democracy movement

543
00:23:58,919 --> 00:24:01,260
their own maidan was suppressed with

544
00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:04,760
violence and torture

545
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:08,820
Belarus then had to submit to Russia in

546
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:10,860
a way that it hadn't previously and so

547
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:13,679
Russia was going to use Belarus to send

548
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:18,840
troops in war materiel into Ukraine via

549
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:21,539
these rail networks right

550
00:24:21,539 --> 00:24:22,860
so

551
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:26,640
the thing about hacking you know is um

552
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:30,120
especially tactically it works right the

553
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:31,380
question is is whether you can achieve

554
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:33,360
some kind of strategic effect

555
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:35,700
so in this case it looked like it may

556
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:39,419
have been a an amalgam of hackers and

557
00:24:39,419 --> 00:24:40,880
spies

558
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:44,159
defectors and we know that in Belarus

559
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:46,559
there's a lot of anti-lucashenko

560
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:48,960
sympathy right so they want change we

561
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:51,240
know that in in Belarus there were came

562
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:53,220
out in the streets in their millions in

563
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:55,020
2020.

564
00:24:55,020 --> 00:24:57,720
so it takes a team right

565
00:24:57,720 --> 00:25:00,059
um in this case uh there was also

566
00:25:00,059 --> 00:25:03,360
Windows XP that was being used by the

567
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:06,240
role the the signal cabinets on the

568
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:07,980
railways

569
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:11,100
um so at the beginning of the war

570
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:13,860
hackers and people on the ground tried

571
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:16,860
to slow this equipment and to disrupt

572
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:18,960
the railway Networks

573
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:20,820
and it's one of those questions you know

574
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:23,220
how you know was it was it decisive was

575
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:26,580
it uh a strategic hack

576
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:27,779
um maybe

577
00:25:27,779 --> 00:25:30,240
but there's belief that it contributed

578
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:33,419
to the 40-mile Convoy north of Kiev in

579
00:25:33,419 --> 00:25:35,400
other words the difficulty of putting

580
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:39,240
troops in material into what was the the

581
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:41,100
ultimate goal at the beginning of this

582
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:42,419
war was you know take over the capital

583
00:25:42,419 --> 00:25:44,580
and kick out zielinski and put in a

584
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:47,520
puppet leader

585
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:49,860
um and then those all those trucks and

586
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:52,380
and tanks became Sitting Ducks right for

587
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:55,860
for the attackers and so so this this is

588
00:25:55,860 --> 00:25:58,020
a candidate for the the biggest you know

589
00:25:58,020 --> 00:26:00,179
or the most strategic or impactful hack

590
00:26:00,179 --> 00:26:04,340
of the War uh so far

591
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:07,679
so you know you could pick any of these

592
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:10,980
dots and sort of drill into it but I do

593
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:13,799
think Ukraine is benefiting from an

594
00:26:13,799 --> 00:26:16,980
incredible level of connectivity and

595
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:18,059
sympathy

596
00:26:18,059 --> 00:26:20,940
so I think so far in the war

597
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:22,320
um we can say that information

598
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:26,159
operations have outshined uh simple info

599
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:29,580
Ops have outshined complex computer

600
00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:33,120
hacking uh so far it's an incredible

601
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:35,100
amount of connectivity so think about it

602
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:38,340
we are still in the as of steel plant

603
00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:40,380
where these soldiers that are

604
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:43,260
underground fighting the Russians still

605
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:45,299
to this day

606
00:26:45,299 --> 00:26:47,220
we still have connectivity with them

607
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:50,100
they're still sending out videos and

608
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:51,900
their family members are still

609
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:54,500
communicating with them via video chat

610
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:57,000
after all of these attacks and

611
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,820
bombardments every day strategic bombing

612
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:03,600
against this facility so connectivity is

613
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:05,760
incredibly important

614
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:09,539
and maybe even decisive ultimately right

615
00:27:09,539 --> 00:27:10,799
I mean in other words you can you can

616
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:12,600
hack my computer

617
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:15,419
yeah it works but I'm going to grab

618
00:27:15,419 --> 00:27:17,940
another device or a friend's device you

619
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:20,880
know or my telephone and so in Ukraine

620
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:23,039
among the things that are happening are

621
00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:26,400
any any Ukrainian civilian can use any

622
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:28,620
telecommunications Network right now for

623
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:29,640
free

624
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:31,860
right you don't have to have you to

625
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:33,539
subscribe to anything or have any money

626
00:27:33,539 --> 00:27:35,460
as long as you've got a smartphone you

627
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:36,840
have connectivity

628
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:38,460
and this has led things to like

629
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:41,279
zielinski being able to talk to you know

630
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:43,980
parliaments around the world in tailored

631
00:27:43,980 --> 00:27:46,559
speeches asking for money and asking for

632
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:49,799
weapons you know if you know despite

633
00:27:49,799 --> 00:27:51,960
constant bombardment if you can't stop

634
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:53,940
that you know you're going to have

635
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:56,220
trouble as an attacker

636
00:27:56,220 --> 00:28:00,059
so what else so the United States has

637
00:28:00,059 --> 00:28:03,059
they have a Shields up website which has

638
00:28:03,059 --> 00:28:06,120
Intelligence updates on the war

639
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:08,159
um best practices and computer security

640
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:11,400
relative to the conflict Etc

641
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:14,700
um the EU has had cyber forces in there

642
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:16,440
because the EU you may or may not know

643
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:18,000
is trying to have its own security

644
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,340
apparatus right

645
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:22,200
um NATO I'm sort of associated with the

646
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:24,299
NATO cyber Center or Think Tank there in

647
00:28:24,299 --> 00:28:26,760
Estonia well guess who the latest member

648
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:29,220
is actually that's not true the latest

649
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:31,440
members last week is South Korea

650
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:34,980
but prior to that it was Ukraine a few

651
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:38,760
weeks ago right and so uh if if you look

652
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:39,960
at

653
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:41,700
the number of members I think it's about

654
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:44,700
30 now I'm super fortunate I was the

655
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:46,559
first researcher ever posted there in

656
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:48,960
2007 a year before it even opened I

657
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:51,120
helped to to build the place for for the

658
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:54,059
Pentagon and now we're up to 30 members

659
00:28:54,059 --> 00:28:55,799
um let's talk about loan hackers

660
00:28:55,799 --> 00:28:59,520
Anonymous right Anonymous contributing

661
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:02,279
in its own way right Anonymous coming

662
00:29:02,279 --> 00:29:04,500
out and tweeting we are fighting on

663
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:06,299
behalf of

664
00:29:06,299 --> 00:29:08,100
the Ukrainian government

665
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:11,100
distributed denial of Secrets right over

666
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:13,740
six million documents have been posted

667
00:29:13,740 --> 00:29:15,480
to the web that have been stolen from

668
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:18,299
the the Russian government 500

669
00:29:18,299 --> 00:29:22,559
000 from the uh the body in Russia that

670
00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:25,500
manages censorship and manages control

671
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:29,580
of the of runet right so not only I.T

672
00:29:29,580 --> 00:29:31,679
firms but I.T SEC firms basically coming

673
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:33,840
out this is this is a tough environment

674
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:36,000
for Russia to operate in and I think it

675
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,799
may be one reason why we haven't seen

676
00:29:37,799 --> 00:29:41,460
this dramatic Cyber attack from Moscow

677
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:43,679
it's because where are they going to

678
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:46,140
start right so I recently moved from

679
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:49,980
Africa to Brazil just before we moved uh

680
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:52,980
we were on uh safari park and we

681
00:29:52,980 --> 00:29:56,279
followed for about an hour a lion and

682
00:29:56,279 --> 00:30:01,740
the lion was circling this huge group of

683
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:04,740
zebra and wildebeest that were all in a

684
00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:06,960
tightly packed formation looking outward

685
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:11,039
and this a lion it was just circling for

686
00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:12,960
about an hour and then finally just you

687
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:15,480
know wandered off into the jungle there

688
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:18,299
was nowhere for the lion to attack it

689
00:30:18,299 --> 00:30:19,740
was one of the most interesting things

690
00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:21,179
I've ever seen

691
00:30:21,179 --> 00:30:23,460
so in the same way I think one of the

692
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:25,679
biggest stories of the war so far has

693
00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:29,399
been the the United nature of the

694
00:30:29,399 --> 00:30:32,399
western response right to to what's

695
00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:35,279
happening uh in in Ukraine and and

696
00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:37,740
Russia

697
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:39,480
um and that's in the traditional

698
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:42,360
Battlefield space as well as in

699
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:44,159
cyberspace

700
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:47,399
um but you know if you think so some of

701
00:30:47,399 --> 00:30:48,960
the big stories like from China for

702
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:50,880
example there was there was a story of

703
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:53,640
Russia getting hacked from Western

704
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:55,260
infrastructure

705
00:30:55,260 --> 00:30:57,240
but at least according to the authors of

706
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:58,440
the article it was in fact Chinese

707
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:00,480
actors they're taking advantage of the

708
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:04,200
situation right to Target Russia from

709
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:06,960
making it look like a western attack

710
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:08,520
um so

711
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:11,580
what you want I think are allies and the

712
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:13,860
the the the broader point I want to make

713
00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:15,840
is and this applies whether you're in

714
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:18,419
your company or in your home or in your

715
00:31:18,419 --> 00:31:19,919
nation

716
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:22,760
um cyberspace is kind of

717
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:27,120
the strength of it is in community and

718
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:29,399
the strength of it is in

719
00:31:29,399 --> 00:31:30,179
um

720
00:31:30,179 --> 00:31:33,539
working with you know maybe researchers

721
00:31:33,539 --> 00:31:36,179
or Allies that you don't even know right

722
00:31:36,179 --> 00:31:39,240
and so it's just it's a it's a

723
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:41,100
similarity of philosophy you want to

724
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:42,919
take advantage of the power of the web

725
00:31:42,919 --> 00:31:47,460
uh to to succeed

726
00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:49,559
so the mid War assessment I do think

727
00:31:49,559 --> 00:31:52,020
that that this

728
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:55,500
information operations and connectivity

729
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:58,260
are key you know if you want to survive

730
00:31:58,260 --> 00:32:01,039
conflict if you want to

731
00:32:01,039 --> 00:32:04,440
succeed right uh denial of service

732
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:06,530
attacks work

733
00:32:06,530 --> 00:32:06,840
[Music]

734
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:07,919
um

735
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:10,980
computer Espionage Works

736
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:13,919
um all of these these you know exploits

737
00:32:13,919 --> 00:32:16,140
can be arrayed against vulnerabilities

738
00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:18,899
in an effective way

739
00:32:18,899 --> 00:32:21,120
um but if you can't stop this you know

740
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:24,480
you can't stop uh ultimately your goal

741
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:27,240
is strategic in this in this case for

742
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:28,440
sure

743
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:31,380
um and you want to achieve and so just

744
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:33,720
like those three main kinds of of Cyber

745
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:36,419
attack I think theft denial and

746
00:32:36,419 --> 00:32:37,860
manipulation

747
00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:41,480
the biggest one by far is connectivity

748
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:45,000
is access is bandwidth

749
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,580
um is saying your piece and then even if

750
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:49,620
you know you get knocked offline guess

751
00:32:49,620 --> 00:32:52,080
what I'm going to appear over here and

752
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:53,700
that's the way censorship works as well

753
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:55,260
you know in your country you can try and

754
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:56,580
censor information and people are going

755
00:32:56,580 --> 00:32:58,260
to go around it and find some other way

756
00:32:58,260 --> 00:33:00,179
some other way to communicate some other

757
00:33:00,179 --> 00:33:02,159
way to collaborate and that's of course

758
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:04,799
what the web is all about right one of

759
00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:05,940
the stories about the founding of the

760
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:08,279
web is it was meant to

761
00:33:08,279 --> 00:33:11,700
um to be a way to survive nuclear war or

762
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:15,600
when a way to survive and attack by a an

763
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:17,580
aggressor

764
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:19,200
so just a couple of slides on what's

765
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,880
happening at NATO because I think this

766
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:23,039
helps to provide some information

767
00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:25,380
perhaps if you don't know it but also

768
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:27,720
some guidance right in terms of advice

769
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:30,299
and best best practices

770
00:33:30,299 --> 00:33:32,340
um so NATO has said that cyberspace is a

771
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:34,980
domain of military operations right it's

772
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:37,620
a it's a space that we are going to

773
00:33:37,620 --> 00:33:39,600
defend

774
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:43,019
um the same as Land Air and sea

775
00:33:43,019 --> 00:33:45,480
this is important right because what's

776
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:47,460
happened so far in the war

777
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:50,399
um Putin wanted to diminish NATO and

778
00:33:50,399 --> 00:33:52,919
instead it's getting twice as big for

779
00:33:52,919 --> 00:33:56,640
Moscow right because Finland is so long

780
00:33:56,640 --> 00:34:00,240
right that it's it's now uh the Border

781
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:03,600
Russia's border with uh with uh NATO has

782
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:07,440
grown to immensely

783
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:09,359
cyber security is a core task of

784
00:34:09,359 --> 00:34:10,800
collective defense for the alliance

785
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:13,739
international law applies in cyberspace

786
00:34:13,739 --> 00:34:16,020
so NATO is saying we don't need any new

787
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:17,580
law for cyberspace we already have

788
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:19,260
international law we have about

789
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:22,859
sovereignty and about promotion of you

790
00:34:22,859 --> 00:34:25,440
know you know rule of law Etc

791
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:27,659
this applies in cyberspace let's figure

792
00:34:27,659 --> 00:34:31,700
out how how it translates

793
00:34:31,859 --> 00:34:34,320
one of the strengths is diversity and a

794
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:37,199
defensive philosophy and again this this

795
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:40,500
is good I think that dictatorships

796
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:44,219
are very fragile uh politically but

797
00:34:44,219 --> 00:34:46,320
they're also fragile in cyberspace

798
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:48,119
because I can say this is the way this

799
00:34:48,119 --> 00:34:50,280
is the only one true way but I've got so

800
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:51,599
many people who are going to say

801
00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:54,839
something uh that I don't expect from an

802
00:34:54,839 --> 00:34:57,660
angle that I don't expect from at a time

803
00:34:57,660 --> 00:35:00,000
uh that I don't expect and then the

804
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,380
Strategic partner with the European

805
00:35:01,380 --> 00:35:03,560
Union is critical because

806
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:05,760
cyberspace of course relies on

807
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:09,619
technology and firms and citizens and

808
00:35:09,619 --> 00:35:12,660
non-governmental organizations Etc and

809
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:14,520
so there's a political side to it that

810
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:16,380
you have to work in Tandem and so NATO

811
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:18,060
and EU if you look at their literature

812
00:35:18,060 --> 00:35:21,240
working ever more closely on Cyber and

813
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:22,680
some of the tactics that are happening

814
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:25,320
okay how do you take these strategic

815
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:27,839
guidelines and and Implement them in the

816
00:35:27,839 --> 00:35:30,300
right way each of the nations of NATO

817
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:34,200
has have has pledged to understand

818
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:36,359
information security to promote

819
00:35:36,359 --> 00:35:38,700
information security within their space

820
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:41,760
one place I've lived is Luxembourg and

821
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:44,400
Luxembourg only has about 300

822
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:47,220
traditional soldiers right but because

823
00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:48,780
of the banking sector there they would

824
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:50,520
have many thousands actually of

825
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:53,579
information security Personnel right so

826
00:35:53,579 --> 00:35:56,040
think about that and that that makes all

827
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:57,839
of a sudden Luxembourg also just joined

828
00:35:57,839 --> 00:36:00,420
the NATO Center in Estonia

829
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:03,839
um but places like Iceland Estonia you

830
00:36:03,839 --> 00:36:05,579
know these small countries can actually

831
00:36:05,579 --> 00:36:08,940
have a big impact uh in this cyber

832
00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:10,820
domain where everything can be quite

833
00:36:10,820 --> 00:36:14,099
asymmetric right even one person you

834
00:36:14,099 --> 00:36:15,960
know creating Wikipedia who's thinking

835
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:18,960
this this idea might work changes the

836
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:21,420
world right so

837
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:23,940
then in order to deconflict have you

838
00:36:23,940 --> 00:36:25,440
ever been in government this word

839
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:27,180
deconfliction is kind of important your

840
00:36:27,180 --> 00:36:29,099
agency and my agency need to at least

841
00:36:29,099 --> 00:36:31,200
coordinate on what we're doing the

842
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:33,300
United States is not very good at that

843
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:34,800
but

844
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:37,380
um in this case the NATO cyberspace

845
00:36:37,380 --> 00:36:39,540
operations center uh is supposed to

846
00:36:39,540 --> 00:36:42,660
deconflict uh cyber operations that

847
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:46,140
countries may be running right malware

848
00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:48,599
information sharing platform partnership

849
00:36:48,599 --> 00:36:51,720
with industry you get the idea it's how

850
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:53,640
do you implement these things in

851
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:55,920
practice and here on the right this

852
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:58,560
picture is locked Shields so I presented

853
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:00,780
at black Defcon I think well over 10

854
00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:03,540
years ago on the first effort to do lock

855
00:37:03,540 --> 00:37:06,359
shields uh and that's when you know 15

856
00:37:06,359 --> 00:37:08,160
years ago we were just in the sound of

857
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:10,619
having a vodka talking about how cool it

858
00:37:10,619 --> 00:37:12,240
would be to you know connect a couple of

859
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:15,240
computers together and to hack and

860
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:16,859
defend right

861
00:37:16,859 --> 00:37:19,680
today locked Shields is well over 2 000

862
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:21,780
people working on it every year and

863
00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:25,260
maybe 50 blue teams huge red team uh

864
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:26,820
incredible and if you're interested you

865
00:37:26,820 --> 00:37:28,980
can actually you know participate at

866
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:31,140
some level as well you can you can apply

867
00:37:31,140 --> 00:37:33,300
to be a part of a blue team for example

868
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:36,599
that uh that defends against uh and is

869
00:37:36,599 --> 00:37:38,339
very critical infrastructure focused

870
00:37:38,339 --> 00:37:41,400
even back then in 2010 we had all these

871
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:45,060
scale models of dams and factories and

872
00:37:45,060 --> 00:37:46,800
they actually had fireworks on the back

873
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:48,780
and the Ultimate Prize if the hackers

874
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:51,000
could figure it out was to actually blow

875
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,820
up the little models that had fireworks

876
00:37:53,820 --> 00:37:55,920
on them

877
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:57,780
so here's an example and I think this is

878
00:37:57,780 --> 00:38:00,480
my last slide but it's just an example

879
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:02,820
of what the NATO cyber Center is putting

880
00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:03,660
out

881
00:38:03,660 --> 00:38:05,760
maybe a thousand Publications by now

882
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:07,320
because it's been around for 15 years

883
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:09,420
and I can say because I was the first

884
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:11,040
researcher there I just want to give

885
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:14,400
props to black hat I submitted a talk to

886
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:18,000
black hat in 2008 black hat Tokyo is

887
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,740
called cyberspace and the changing

888
00:38:19,740 --> 00:38:22,320
nature of warfare and it got accepted

889
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:25,800
and so I flew from Estonia to to uh to

890
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:27,900
Tokyo to give it and it became the first

891
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:30,240
document it still is if you sort by time

892
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:33,420
on the this NATO cyber Center Library

893
00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:36,740
I'm lucky enough to have the very first

894
00:38:36,740 --> 00:38:39,660
uh publication and it was at placad so

895
00:38:39,660 --> 00:38:41,880
that's why I'm mentioning it here but

896
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:43,200
this is one of the latest or it's about

897
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:46,820
a year old or so but it is the

898
00:38:46,820 --> 00:38:51,359
result of many nations and many actually

899
00:38:51,359 --> 00:38:53,339
private firms as well and consulting

900
00:38:53,339 --> 00:38:56,040
firms and so it's a kind of example of a

901
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:57,420
strategic product if you want to think

902
00:38:57,420 --> 00:38:59,339
about your your country if you're

903
00:38:59,339 --> 00:39:02,220
working on behalf of Singapore a lot of

904
00:39:02,220 --> 00:39:04,020
the things that you need to think think

905
00:39:04,020 --> 00:39:07,320
about from the Strategic to the Tactical

906
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:09,119
so that's my talk thank you so much

907
00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:11,400
we're out of time I don't know if I can

908
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:13,500
take a question or not but I'll set I'll

909
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:15,480
definitely be around for a little while

910
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:16,859
if you want to chat about these things

911
00:39:16,859 --> 00:39:19,140
but thank you so much for your time I

912
00:39:19,140 --> 00:39:20,820
really appreciate it and it's an honor

913
00:39:20,820 --> 00:39:23,040
to be here uh and hope to see you again

914
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:24,410
