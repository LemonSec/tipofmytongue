00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,720
hello and welcome to the session in the

3
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:20,480
next 25 minutes we'll talk about a

4
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:22,080
recent important innovation in the malwa

5
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:24,560
ecosystem namely that malicious actors

6
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:26,080
are using the bitcoin blockchain for

7
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:28,480
spreading command and call information

8
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:29,840
and the issue with this is that this

9
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:31,519
makes it very difficult to detect and

10
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:33,200
mitigate this vector with the technology

11
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,120
we currently have

12
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:36,719
in this talk we show you how this

13
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:38,719
mechanism works in the pony malware we

14
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:40,960
show you how the actors learned and

15
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:43,120
innovated over the course of a year and

16
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:44,800
we tell you how we were successfully

17
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:47,680
able to take over the operation

18
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:49,760
when we talk about cyber security and

19
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:51,120
melbourne in particular we have to

20
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:52,879
realize that this is a continuous game

21
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:54,480
of cat and mouse

22
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,879
each time defenses get good enough to

23
00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:58,320
make a difference and affect the bottom

24
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:00,320
line the criminals tune it up a notch

25
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:02,160
and innovate and this has been going on

26
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,559
for the past 25 years this evolution

27
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:06,400
goes on in waves and has occurred in

28
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,920
different domains

29
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,119
for instance

30
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:10,799
when we look at how malware is written

31
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:12,560
we saw the emergence of things such as

32
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:15,040
encryption polymorphism or metamorphism

33
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:17,680
starting from the 1990s we also saw

34
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:19,920
change in the way that malware talks the

35
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:22,159
botnet or the subordinate master while

36
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:24,320
initial malware used interdrillate chat

37
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:27,040
to receive and send information irc

38
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,040
stands out quite a bit in normal network

39
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,200
traffic so very soon this malware

40
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,320
adopted http and https based command

41
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:36,079
control channels

42
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:38,960
we also changes in how malware prevents

43
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,880
from being analyzed so we saw

44
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,960
anti-debugging and anti-virtualization

45
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,119
techniques emerging the stage

46
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:46,960
and there has been innovations in the

47
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:49,280
way that addressing has been done so

48
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,200
while static ip addresses can block

49
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,040
easily and domain names are routinely

50
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,360
being seized in the 2000s we saw the

51
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,960
immersion of domain generation

52
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:59,840
algorithms or dgas in short and the dja

53
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,600
generates a large number of domain names

54
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,200
that are valid only for a short time

55
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,439
interval and behind any of these the c

56
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:07,520
and c0 could be hiding so in order to

57
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,440
take it down you would have to block all

58
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,200
of these domain names which makes it

59
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,680
very cumbersome to do

60
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,280
when we look at this we might conclude

61
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,560
that this situation has been more or

62
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,400
less static for the past five years

63
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,160
however there has been the next step in

64
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,760
the sequence of step

65
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,520
a new innovation that we need to be

66
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,520
aware of

67
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:28,640
in 2017 the kerber malware adopted a new

68
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,560
principle of addressing

69
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,959
it exchanged cnc information via the

70
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:35,280
blockchain this is now being adopted by

71
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,200
pony and other male when becomes much

72
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,040
more widespread and it is important that

73
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,800
we as defenders are aware of this

74
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,800
evolution step and that we build new

75
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,879
types of defenses to detect and mitigate

76
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:46,160
this factor

77
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,360
if you're interested in learning more

78
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,120
about kerber we refer you to a report

79
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,879
from our lab while we study how the

80
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:52,959
malware works the ttp used and how the

81
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:54,959
infrastructure works you can find the

82
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:58,800
url to this report here on the slide

83
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,080
when we look at our portfolio of

84
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,480
security defenses there are three main

85
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,400
angles that we used to deal with malware

86
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,959
and botnet infections today if you have

87
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:08,400
a domain name that you know it's

88
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,640
malicious you block it if you have a

89
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:13,200
malware sample that uses a dga you take

90
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,360
it apart and you study the algorithm and

91
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,120
from it you print all domain names it

92
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,959
will ever generate and this list you can

93
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:21,120
now put into your dns server block it

94
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,680
create alerting rules and so on

95
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,159
you can also detect and mitigate based

96
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:28,400
on the behavior from malware so while

97
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,920
you might be occasionally mistyping a

98
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,159
domain name it is very unlikely that the

99
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:33,840
client requests thousands of high

100
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,080
entropy domain names and the bulk of

101
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:38,239
which don't exist so these so-called

102
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:40,239
annex domain lookups if a large number

103
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:42,080
of them occurs this is typically a sign

104
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,400
for a malware infection

105
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,440
finally

106
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:48,480
you also can mitigate botnet by finding

107
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,080
locating and seizing the physical

108
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,080
infrastructure if you take down the cnc

109
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,400
server itself the botnet typically will

110
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:57,120
fall silent

111
00:03:58,480 --> 00:03:59,920
the work that we're presenting in this

112
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,439
talk is the result of the international

113
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:03,680
cooperation between fujitsu integration

114
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:06,000
laboratories in tokyo japan and the

115
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,519
hasselblad institute for digital

116
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:09,439
engineering in potsdam germany my name

117
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:11,120
is christian door i'll be working with

118
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,319
you through the first part of this

119
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:15,120
presentation

120
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,798
how does malware coordination by the

121
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:18,639
bitcoin blockchain work it's quite

122
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:20,478
simple you make transactions on the

123
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:22,479
blockchain and you encode into the

124
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:25,120
payment how much is being paid by whom

125
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,800
and when the information that you want

126
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,400
to transmit

127
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,560
how is it being done in pony

128
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:33,040
the transaction itself signals the cnc

129
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,840
information this value is encoded in the

130
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,840
amount of money that is being paid

131
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,919
between ascending wallet and a signaling

132
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:42,560
vote in this example the bitcoin address

133
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:45,520
starting with one n94r is the sending

134
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,919
wallet and the bitcoin address starting

135
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:50,000
with 1bkeg

136
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,199
is going to be the signaling wallet

137
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:54,800
and if we have the trainment amount of

138
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:58,479
23900 satoshis if we can translate this

139
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:01,759
into hexadecimal that is 5d8e we chunk

140
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:04,240
this up into two parts and we again

141
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,720
translate this back into a numerical

142
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:09,520
value 93 142

143
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,520
we now have the first two parts of the

144
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:14,560
ip address if we flip these two values

145
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,520
let's just look at the second

146
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,320
transaction value

147
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:21,440
52736 or ce0 again you split it up you

148
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:25,120
get 206 and 0 and you flip these two

149
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,800
values to get the second part of the ip

150
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,360
address so now clients are monitoring

151
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,360
specific wallets on the blockchain

152
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,600
they're retrieving the last payments and

153
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,680
from the last two they are decoding this

154
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,520
in the following manner to now obtain

155
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:43,039
the cnc ip address 142 93 0 and 206

156
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:45,039
why two transactions while you could

157
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:46,960
signal it in one transaction the money

158
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:48,800
necessary to transfer this information

159
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:51,120
would be astronomically high so by using

160
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,800
two transactions you keep the cost for

161
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,800
maintaining the cnc mechanism relatively

162
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,479
low

163
00:05:56,479 --> 00:05:58,400
so when we look at the three main angles

164
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,479
that we introduced for how we deal with

165
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:02,560
malware and botnet infections we see

166
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,400
that we now have a significant problem

167
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,400
in our hands from this latest innovation

168
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,240
step because much of what we have been

169
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,639
doing doesn't work anymore let's look at

170
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:12,400
option one predicting domain names and

171
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,800
stopping them well there isn't nothing

172
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,199
to predict anymore so there is not a

173
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:19,039
malware algorithm we can take apart by

174
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:20,720
looking at the sample

175
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,080
all of the information is being

176
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:24,400
exchanged on the blockchain and i cannot

177
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,000
predict in the future what is going to

178
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,600
be the next payment that somebody makes

179
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,919
on the blockchain so as soon as i do

180
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:32,080
something the criminal can make a new

181
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:34,240
payment and immediately all of the bots

182
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,720
are updating to the new information

183
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,479
i also cannot remove anything from the

184
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:40,000
blockchain because the blockchain has

185
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,639
been designed to be this way so option 1

186
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:44,800
completely goes out of the window

187
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,639
how about option 2 detecting lookup

188
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:48,960
patterns especially these telltale nx

189
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:51,919
domain lookups well there isn't any dns

190
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:53,840
lookups at all there isn't a high

191
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:56,080
entropy domain name that is being varied

192
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:58,240
the blockchain reveals directly the ip

193
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,840
address so there's not going to be any

194
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,840
dns request to something that i can

195
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:04,560
track nor is there any nx domains so

196
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:07,360
option two is also out of the window how

197
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,199
about option three locating and seizing

198
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:11,199
the physical infrastructure well it

199
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:13,280
depends in case of the covermail where

200
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,880
we saw that the adversaries were using

201
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:17,680
tor to hide the cnc server location and

202
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,759
depending how this is being done this

203
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:23,440
might be also then difficult to do

204
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:26,560
so we tracked the pony malware authors

205
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,560
for the course of one year and we

206
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,639
continuously observed them and we saw

207
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:32,000
that they went through many rounds of

208
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,240
redesign and continuous improvement

209
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:36,080
for instance they experiment with

210
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,440
different tactics for reaching the

211
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,520
wallet they added more apis in order to

212
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:42,000
make it more resilient we also saw that

213
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,599
they're using different techniques and

214
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:45,360
change them over time for signaling the

215
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:48,080
ip address we talk refer to these as the

216
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:49,919
time lag and the fee order strategy

217
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:51,840
later on and we will discuss more

218
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:54,479
details about them and we saw changes in

219
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:55,599
when and how they were making

220
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:57,680
transactions so they changed time zones

221
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:00,240
in order to have lower fees for the

222
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,240
upkeep of the infrastructure two of

223
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,000
these toyoshi will discuss with you in

224
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,840
the following in more detail if you're

225
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,520
interested in in-depth treatment beyond

226
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,360
that you can download our full paper

227
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,840
here below on the

228
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:13,919
ul not only did the signaling change but

229
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:15,759
also the inner workings of the malware

230
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:19,360
and the cnc server itself

231
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,120
so i said two transactions are needed to

232
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,120
signal the ip address and this was thus

233
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:25,199
done for cost reasons and if you have

234
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:26,800
two transactions you have to challenge

235
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,319
that these need to be in the correct

236
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:30,160
order otherwise the ip address would not

237
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:32,640
be correct so if transaction two would

238
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,719
finish before transaction one you have

239
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:36,320
an issue because now the client

240
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,399
comparing the blockchain would decode it

241
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:40,159
and go to the wrong ip address for the

242
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:41,679
cnc server

243
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:43,760
but you have another problem

244
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,680
if you have only one transaction that

245
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,600
has been included the last two

246
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,800
transactions would give you the wrong

247
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,560
result because the clients would now

248
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,399
decode transaction one from the new

249
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:54,640
update and transaction 2 from the

250
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,720
previous update as the current location

251
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:59,279
of the cnc server so why would this

252
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:02,080
happen even if transaction 1 is being

253
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:04,480
made before transaction 2 it could be

254
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:07,040
that a miner doesn't include it for now

255
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:09,519
and even if transaction 1 and 2 go into

256
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:11,279
the blockchain in the correct order

257
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:13,279
there could be a delay that they are

258
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:14,800
they are not placed into consecutive

259
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:17,519
blocks so they may be placed minutes or

260
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:20,080
maybe even hours apart and during this

261
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,320
time any client going to the blockchain

262
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:25,600
will decode the wrong ip address

263
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,360
so the obvious question that the

264
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,200
adversaries ask themselves is how do you

265
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,200
get transactions in the blockchain in

266
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,200
the correct order and into consecutive

267
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,360
blocks without really spending too much

268
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,760
money on it

269
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:40,240
so why is money an issue here let us

270
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,399
first see how the blockchain works in

271
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:44,399
the blockchain people are creating new

272
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:46,800
blocks and these blocks contain

273
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,160
transactions that are currently being

274
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:50,720
made and are cryptographically linked to

275
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,080
the previous blockchain blocks

276
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,399
beforehand

277
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:56,240
and this

278
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,080
work on the blockchain where people

279
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,240
continuously mine blocks is not done for

280
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,600
free people don't contribute their

281
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,279
computing power for free but they get a

282
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:05,600
reward when they create a new block

283
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,360
and the money that they get from it is

284
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,519
being paid by people who are making

285
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:11,440
transactions so if anna is sending bob

286
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,839
some money she pays a fee for making

287
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:15,680
these transactions on the big bitcoin

288
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:18,560
network and the higher the fee that you

289
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:20,640
offer for this transaction the higher

290
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,800
the incentive is to the miner to include

291
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,000
in the block that they're currently

292
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,880
mining and the more likely is to get in

293
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:27,760
so

294
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,839
fees being paid makes a difference let

295
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:31,760
us now look in more detail on how the

296
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,839
adversary used the cnc mechanism of

297
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:37,519
signal via the blockchain in practice

298
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:40,160
thank you christian my name is from

299
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,480
fujitsu system integration laboratories

300
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:45,440
from here let's see how the advisory

301
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,440
they tried to evolve their tactics

302
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:50,560
techniques and procedures and let's

303
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:52,880
learn about two case studies based on

304
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:55,200
actual advisory behaviors

305
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,279
the first question is that the advisor

306
00:10:57,279 --> 00:10:59,920
equipped with the market turmoil

307
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:03,360
influenced by the bitcoin halving

308
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,519
the upper line graph represents a feed

309
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:07,760
which that buzzer reset on transactions

310
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:10,720
in order to update the exchange ips

311
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:13,200
the lower line graph represents the time

312
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,360
conformed by minus

313
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,680
i consider the time as a numerical value

314
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,440
and brought it

315
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,760
the bitcoin halving reduced the profit

316
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:24,959
of the minus then please temporary sort

317
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:27,120
the fiscal means the increase of the

318
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,360
cost from the other batteries side and

319
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:32,959
the advisory had to cope with the

320
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:34,399
fisa

321
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:37,920
in order to protect their profit

322
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:40,000
before the bitcoin hubbing they

323
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,720
basically updated the asian ip during

324
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:45,600
european working time

325
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,000
after the bitcoin hubbing they shifted

326
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,079
their trading time from working time to

327
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:51,200
midnight

328
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,279
they avoided busy time in the market in

329
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:55,440
order to save their cost

330
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,839
here pays attention after the bitcoin

331
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:00,560
hubbing and they updated their chances

332
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:05,839
ip and from three to five european time

333
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:07,920
in order to realize or take over which

334
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:11,040
is a main topic of this presentation

335
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:13,519
it is essential to grasp the timing of

336
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:16,639
xianxi update

337
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:18,800
the second case study is that the

338
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:21,120
advisory tried to confirm two

339
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:23,600
transactions in the correct order as

340
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:26,560
quickly as possible as christian

341
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:29,360
explained in the previous slide

342
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:32,000
the advisory tried two strategies and

343
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,720
time lag and pre-order in this slide i'd

344
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,480
like to explain about the timeline

345
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,160
strategy

346
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:40,480
the purpose of the time-lapse strategy

347
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:43,519
is to certainly control the order of

348
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:45,440
confirmation

349
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:48,240
they simply conduct a second transaction

350
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:50,079
after the confirmation of the first

351
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:52,240
transaction this means that two

352
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,320
transactions are confirmed in the in

353
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:56,240
different blocks

354
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:59,519
in blockchain principle a block is

355
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:02,399
generated every 10 minutes

356
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:04,639
the program or the timeline strategy is

357
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:07,120
the time log between the confirmation of

358
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,279
the first and second transaction

359
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:12,560
the time log is over approximately 10

360
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,000
minutes

361
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,600
if the second transaction is not

362
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:18,160
confirmed the change update is not

363
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,360
completed

364
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:22,079
least so to speak downtime reduce the

365
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:26,079
profit of the ad batteries

366
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,399
next let me explain about the fee order

367
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:32,959
strategy the motivation of free order

368
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:36,240
strategy is to avoid the time log

369
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,639
they tried to confirm two transactions

370
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:40,639
in the same block

371
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:43,040
since miners in the blockchain prior to

372
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:46,480
confirm transaction which set higher p

373
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:47,199
on

374
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:49,839
and the advisor is set higher fee on the

375
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:51,839
first transaction compared to the second

376
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:53,680
transaction

377
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:55,360
nobody can understand the relation

378
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:57,920
between fees and confirmation

379
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,560
and this uncertainty is the program of

380
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:03,839
the pre-order strategy

381
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:08,959
okay we actually observed adversaries

382
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:12,000
trial and error of fig order strategy

383
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,720
let's see the trial and error in this

384
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,240
right

385
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,680
the upper line graph represents the

386
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:19,279
difference of blocks in the first and

387
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:21,760
second transaction and downtime

388
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:24,160
the lower line graph represents a piece

389
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:27,600
which the advisor is set on transaction

390
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,720
the advisory basically is selected the

391
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,320
time rank strategy

392
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:36,079
we observed over two hours downtime

393
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:39,600
this means that the change update was

394
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:43,120
not completed during two hours

395
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:46,880
and the mario could not uh

396
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:49,920
decode correct chances ip

397
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:50,800
and

398
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:54,720
adversary could not control the mario

399
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:57,760
two hours is very long time so this is a

400
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:00,800
big program from the advisory side

401
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:03,600
then they started conducting the trial

402
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:06,160
and error of pola strategy since june

403
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,680
2020

404
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:10,399
while they conduct two transactions in

405
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:13,519
the same block and they set higher fee

406
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:15,440
on the first transaction compared to the

407
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:18,320
second transaction

408
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,800
it seems that they succeeded in

409
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:23,519
realizing the fee order strategy however

410
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:25,839
they returned back to the time-lapse

411
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:27,440
strategy

412
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:30,800
they might might not be sure to control

413
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:33,040
the order of confirmation based on the

414
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:36,000
field strategy

415
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:40,639
from here let's move on to the main core

416
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:42,880
part of this presentation

417
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:45,440
let me explain about our takeover

418
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,040
mechanism

419
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:50,399
the mechanism for hiding cnc ip in the

420
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:52,240
blockchain by the adversary was

421
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:53,519
ingenious

422
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:55,519
once transactions are covered by the

423
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:59,040
miners and nobody can take down and

424
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:01,759
confirm transaction

425
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:04,000
and these trades

426
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,839
were not a crime of course not money

427
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:09,759
rendering they simply moved their

428
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:12,639
bitcoin from their own bitcoin address

429
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:15,279
to their own bitcoin address

430
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:17,839
and abused bit blockchain api is

431
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:19,279
regiment

432
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:21,440
it is difficult to risk communication as

433
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,279
mauritius

434
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:26,399
the basic idea of our takeover is to

435
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:29,120
inject transactions hiding our single

436
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,399
server ip

437
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:33,360
to the bitcoin address controlled by the

438
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:36,560
adversaries as the rendezvous point for

439
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:39,360
mario communication

440
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,680
before the takeover

441
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:44,320
we carefully tested the feasibility of

442
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,279
the

443
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:47,360
takeover

444
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:48,959
based on the dynamic analysis in the

445
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:51,360
sandbox we confirmed that

446
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:54,480
the malware made use of incoming money

447
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,480
without checking where the incoming

448
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:58,240
money comes from

449
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:01,680
therefore anybody can inject any ip

450
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:05,439
address to the rendezvous point

451
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:09,359
we consider this as design mistake

452
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:11,919
in addition from the sql constellation

453
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:14,640
point of view we confirm that if the

454
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:18,880
malware cannot download required dll

455
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:22,079
the safeguard mechanism of the maria

456
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:25,039
deleted maria itself

457
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:26,079
therefore

458
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:28,880
our sinkhole server did not download any

459
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:32,720
expiratory pilot from infected clients

460
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:36,080
and certain infection realized

461
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:38,799
here please remember cyber security is a

462
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:40,960
game of cat and mass

463
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:43,840
of course we anticipated their evasive

464
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:46,799
behavior from the next slide we will

465
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:49,600
show a game of cat and mass

466
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:52,720
offense and defense and actual evasive

467
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:56,080
behavior by the batteries

468
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:00,240
okay let's see a game of cat at mass

469
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:02,880
based on the actual offense and defense

470
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:05,760
we conducted first takeover on august

471
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:09,919
14. as i explained in case studies

472
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:14,000
we grasp the timing of shenzhen update

473
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,400
and during the

474
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,000
offense and defense

475
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,360
and the advisory basically used

476
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:24,399
time-lapse strategy

477
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:27,679
they suspended their merchant's activity

478
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:31,200
for two days and reset asian shi so we

479
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,360
waited and saw

480
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:35,600
the activity for a day

481
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:38,559
and they updated the xianxi

482
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:41,360
so we conducted second takeover on

483
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:43,520
august 17th

484
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:46,799
after our second takeover

485
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:50,160
they changed the pattern of shenzhen ip

486
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,200
update

487
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:54,400
from midnight to working time and they

488
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:57,600
updated the asian ship

489
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:00,799
after that we conducted our third

490
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:02,000
takeover

491
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,840
on august 19

492
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,919
and it seemed that they stopped their

493
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:07,919
martial activity

494
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:10,160
however

495
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:12,720
they designed their mission mechanism

496
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:15,280
and restarted their martial activity

497
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:18,399
from september past

498
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:24,640
okay let me summarize our takeover

499
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:27,039
during the battle or occupying mario

500
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:29,440
random point we conducted three times

501
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:30,799
takeover

502
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:33,760
and we estimated the mitigation of the

503
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:36,400
damage by our takeover

504
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:40,000
before our takeover the advisory updated

505
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,960
in the ascendancy once a day

506
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:46,320
and we realized maria offline for 17

507
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,320
days

508
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:49,640
we identified

509
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:53,200
275 infections at the first

510
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,720
takeover

511
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,400
and according to

512
00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:00,400
our citing report average 400 us dollar

513
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,760
is stolen

514
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,120
per account

515
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:06,720
during credential theft

516
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:09,120
and therefore we estimated that we

517
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:12,400
prevented 2 million us dollar by our

518
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,960
takeover

519
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,840
okay let's see

520
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:19,120
and

521
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:22,559
new energy mechanism by the adversaries

522
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:26,080
the mechanism for hiding shenzhen ip in

523
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:28,960
the blockchain was ingenious however the

524
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:31,520
mechanism has designed mistake

525
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:34,159
we made use of the design mistake we

526
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:37,039
succeeded in taking over

527
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:40,080
our takeover forced the advisory to

528
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:42,720
suspend their martial activity and we

529
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:46,240
anticipated the evasive behavior

530
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:48,640
so in fact it took

531
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:52,000
17 days to redesign and implement the

532
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,280
new change mechanism

533
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:58,240
by the adversaries

534
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:01,840
okay related answers right to the

535
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:04,400
question how did advisories evade our

536
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,679
takeover

537
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:08,720
the advisory changes landing point from

538
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:11,200
the receiving bitcoin address to the

539
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:13,600
sending bitcoin address

540
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:15,919
this enabled the malware to download

541
00:21:15,919 --> 00:21:18,320
only the transactions food-sending

542
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:20,159
bitcoin address is controlled by the

543
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:23,200
advisories simultaneously release

544
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:26,240
prevented us from taking over

545
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:28,720
we could not take over anymore

546
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:31,200
on the other hand even if they identify

547
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,720
our disturbance

548
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:34,720
and they did not change bitcoin

549
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,320
addresses

550
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:39,200
it might be tough work for advisories to

551
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,960
synchronize the

552
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,880
rendering point and changing bitcoin

553
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:46,640
addresses so we could track the margins

554
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:49,200
activity by monitoring a bitcoin

555
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,880
operation

556
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:54,640
it should be the vulnerability

557
00:21:57,679 --> 00:21:59,919
on the adversary coped with the

558
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:02,559
difficulty of evading our takeover and

559
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:04,559
they eventually gave up the attack

560
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:06,400
infrastructure

561
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:09,120
they destroyed this closed the

562
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:11,840
vulnerability of

563
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:12,880
search

564
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:15,520
the bitcoin search means the increase of

565
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:19,120
the cost from the advisory side

566
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:22,640
the value of bitcoin increased by five

567
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:23,919
times

568
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:26,320
compared to the

569
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:29,919
value out of our takeover

570
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:32,240
when the course was not worth it they

571
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:33,600
gave up

572
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:36,720
and now and they suspended martial's

573
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:37,919
activity

574
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:41,520
however if the value of bitcoin is

575
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:42,960
dropped

576
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:46,559
there is a possibility that they disturb

577
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:49,520
their margins activity in the future

578
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:51,919
please continue to be careful

579
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:56,080
regarding this emerging attack

580
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:59,039
releasing the concluding remarks and

581
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:01,919
takeaways blockchain based shenzhen is

582
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:05,039
the next step of criminal ttps we could

583
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:07,200
study how the advisor is improved the

584
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:09,120
ttps over time

585
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:11,280
a simple design mistake allowed us to

586
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:13,919
take over the operation until they

587
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:15,440
redesigned

588
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:17,679
this mechanism was ingenious however

589
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:20,880
vulnerable to bitcoin search as a result

590
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,559
they gave up

591
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:25,200
after bedding i'll take over we could

592
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,240
track

593
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:28,080
the marshals activity by monitoring

594
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:30,960
bitcoin behavior

595
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:34,559
we hope that our findings and insight

596
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:37,200
will be useful for security people

597
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:40,400
against this emerging attack

598
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:42,480
that's all for today thank you for

599
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:44,400
coming to our session

600
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,720
if you have any questions

601
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:49,760
please feel free to ask the question

602
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:53,000
thank you
