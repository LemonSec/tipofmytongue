then we will show you what is google

26
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:21,680
instant app

27
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:24,960
apple app clips and also there are tank

28
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,560
surface

29
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,159
and the third part

is show you how to hide changing

31
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,880
google pwn

the fourth part is

34
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,000
how to achieve remote command exclusion

35
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,840
on quick app and the next part is

36
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,200
conclusions

37
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,159
and takeaways

38
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,159
okay

39
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:51,840
let's first save a brief introduction

40
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,000
there are different kind of installation

41
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,560
apps like android app clips google

42
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:01,040
instant app quick app google play

43
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:04,079
but they are have all similar features

44
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:06,079
they are small in size and load needed

45
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:07,439
to be installed

46
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:09,520
so they can be loaded quickly

47
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:12,160
and the user process is very similar to

48
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:15,040
a normal app

49
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:18,640
on this slide

50
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:21,680
you can see there are many entries which

51
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:26,640
is easy to discover like qr code web nfc

52
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,000
app center

53
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,800
but also there are other interests like

54
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,280
message

55
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:38,400
ok please let my colleague imin

56
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,640
to give you a detailed explain on

57
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:44,319
instagram and have clips

58
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,200
thanks i'm going to start by showing

59
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,800
google extender app

60
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,959
what is google is in the app

61
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:54,319
it is an instant trial exploration

62
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:56,879
no need to download the app in order to

63
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:59,840
a child purpose of internet charts

64
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:02,080
google has made a limit on the size of

65
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,599
the instant app

66
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:05,840
the size of the application cannot

67
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,360
execute

68
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,280
15 mb

69
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,760
and the google instant app is based on

70
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:16,640
damage feature so it can be fast update

71
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,360
this is some entrance of google instant

72
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,319
app

73
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:22,959
you can click try now on the

74
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:23,920
app

75
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:26,640
detail page in the google play store or

76
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,959
click instant play on the game detail

77
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:32,720
page in the google game store

78
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:35,280
or you can click the app design link

79
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,560
anywhere

80
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,840
message

81
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,239
and when you use google to search the

82
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:41,840
related keywords

83
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:44,239
you can click on the search result to

84
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:47,840
open the google instant app

85
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,640
and at least see the basics just of

86
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,239
google instant app

87
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:54,799
the first picture introduced the

88
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:56,959
concept of

89
00:03:56,959 --> 00:03:59,040
apk spreads

90
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,760
google spreads the application into a

91
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,680
lot of models

92
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:06,879
and android is able to download each of

93
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:09,360
these features based on the

94
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,200
assessor ticking

95
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,280
as long as there is at least one

96
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,560
activity

97
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:18,160
in the application that handles the url

98
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,440
this means

99
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:22,160
that you need which part of the feature

100
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,479
then dump this part of it

101
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:26,320
so google instant app

102
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:29,840
need to configure blink

103
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:33,600
blue instant app supports two types of

104
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,560
link dipping and appley

105
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:39,600
app link is a kind of duplicate but they

106
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,520
have some difference

107
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:44,639
deeply supports any custom internet url

108
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:45,680
scheme

109
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:50,320
but appling only supports http or atps

110
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:53,280
internet url schema deeplymover can use

111
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:56,080
any internet action but applying only

112
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:59,520
all intended action of action that will

113
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:02,320
dealing can set any category

114
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:05,280
but applying only support browser and

115
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,199
default

116
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:09,520
deep link will not verify the link when

117
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:12,639
the one click the link

118
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:16,000
but applink will go to your website for

119
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,479
verification through http proto

120
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:23,680
when you click on a deep link

121
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:27,039
make sure for the user to select which

122
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:29,280
app to open the link

123
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:32,000
but when you click on app link

124
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,560
it will automatically jump to the

125
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,720
specific application without the user

126
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:39,600
should therefore

127
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,560
applying is recommended by user google

128
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,240
instant app

129
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,440
in summary

130
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:48,800
uplink has the following features

131
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:52,160
safer and straps

132
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:56,080
a more similar user expression

133
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,400
support android internet app instant

134
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,639
loading technology

135
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:05,960
and can find your app from google search

136
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:09,360
and this is the configuration example of

137
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:12,400
applying defined in under manifest

138
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,319
you'll need to define an

139
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:18,160
android schema of atp and or atps

140
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:22,479
and configure category as broadband

141
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:27,120
as we said before

142
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,759
applying need to go to your website to

143
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:31,520
verify the link

144
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:34,240
so you need to create a new film named

145
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,639
accessing the data

146
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:39,039
in your website dictionary

147
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:41,759
in this film you'll need to convince the

148
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:44,319
pack name and signature

149
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:47,199
you're specific for this deep applying

150
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:50,240
uplink jump

151
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:54,080
google instant app has some permission

152
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,599
design

153
00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:59,680
instant app enable app burglar models

154
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:03,759
can only use field app permissions

155
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:06,960
instant apple can't interface with the

156
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,039
insta app unless

157
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:10,000
one of

158
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,759
the following conductions are satisfied

159
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:14,880
like

160
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:19,680
a visible to instant apple issue

161
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:22,560
or contain a category browser internet

162
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,319
filter

163
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:26,400
and google internet will not support

164
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:30,679
background service and notifications

165
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,400
next

166
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:36,080
i will introduce apple app clips apple

167
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,800
eclipse is not an ios

168
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,720
progressive web app

169
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,560
actually

170
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:46,000
apple clips is a ios app but just a

171
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,720
small part of your app

172
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:51,680
app clips is easy to discover

173
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,400

00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,800
location to launch an

177
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:09,840
app clip even from the lock screen

178
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:12,319
a yoke also place

179
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:14,879
qr code at a special location to let

180
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:16,800
user launch an

181
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,759
app clip by screen

182
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:22,960
the code with the barcode reader or the

183
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:25,280
camera app

184
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,680
when your website web page is configured

185
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:31,680
with a small app final for app clips

186
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:36,399
user can just tap to open it from there

187
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:38,000
when you amber

188
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,279
enable sharing with your app clip

189
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:45,279
users can send it via a message and the

190
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:48,399
person who receive it can open it right

191
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:50,480
from message

192
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:53,839
when you have clips is a side wing with

193
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:57,440
a special location you can resist your

194
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:00,560
app clips to appear on place card in

195
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:01,760
maps

196
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:06,519
so the user can open the folder

197
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:11,519
and this is the business child of

198
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:12,959
app clips

199
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:15,600
when coming through the entrance just

200
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,680
introduced

201
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:20,160
clips will go to the web servers to

202
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:23,440
verify the warranty of the link

203
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,519
if the link is legal

204
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:28,160
then open the clip and the

205
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:31,440
clip can exchange it with four apps

206
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:34,959
through the native sdk

207
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:38,560
and this is atomic

208
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,880
eclipse

209
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,959
invocation form

210
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:45,920
when you come in from the entrance just

211
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,360
introduced

212
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,600
the system will determine whether the

213
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:52,800
full app is completely installed

214
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,640
if it is installed

215
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:58,080
the company application will be open

216
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:01,360
if it is not installed the lcaps card

217
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,440
will pop up

218
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,680
you can choose to click

219
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,760
install the full app

220
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,760
on the app clip card

221
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:12,720
then well jump to the app store to

222
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,240
download it

223
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:17,680
you can also choose to try the app

224
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:20,880
and then please app clip while open

225
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:24,160
the app clip also provides the function

226
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:26,399
of downloading for app

227
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:28,079
after pro of

228
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:30,079
inactivity

229
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:32,480
the system will automatically

230
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:36,079
delete its application

231
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:42,720
and this is a

232
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:46,000
an app clip cannot shorted it without

233
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,640
any other app

234
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,800
except it's for app

235
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:54,560
fcable and forever shorted through group

236
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:55,680
container

237
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:58,160
you can see it in the picture of this

238
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:01,160
site

239
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,920
and this is the other permission design

240
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:06,480
of app clips

241
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:09,920
limit of triangle is always enabled in

242
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,519
apple app clips

243
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:13,519
apple clips cannot performance

244
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:15,760
background activity

245
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:18,480
to protect the user date app apple app

246
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:21,680
clip cannot access mode mounting and

247
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,200
fitting state

248
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,600
and music and media

249
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:29,279
this front app like contest films

250
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:30,480
message

251
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,880
recommender and photos

252
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:35,839
app clips cannot request

253
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:39,120
continuous location access

254
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:42,560
apple clips only support 8 hours

255
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:45,518
notifications

256
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:47,440
next

257
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:50,000
i will introduce a historic case study

258
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
of instantan app

259
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,519
this is come from an acm paper

260
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:58,639
it introduced a way of hijacking its

261
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:01,040
instant access

262
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:03,519
when select the app url

263
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:07,200
with smart text selection in your app

264
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,839
let's select

265
00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:10,560
mia

266
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:14,079
and well recommend our mri as a

267
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:17,360
condition for the processed url

268
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,440
then microtech

269
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:23,040
created provided data for user and hit

270
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,160
itself by

271
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:30,160
re-broadcasting the url with intent then

272
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:33,279
click a year url in an app or instant

273
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:34,240
app

274
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:37,519
now the android will always use our

275
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:41,040
memoir a to open the url without user's

276
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:43,599
consent

277
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,760
this is because the instant app is

278
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:50,320
configured with deep link instead of app

279
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,680
link

280
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:53,279
when the mouse

281
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:55,839
multicross application name starts with

282
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:56,880
a

283
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:59,839
there are rank higher than google chips

284
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:01,040
for

285
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:04,160
android to select

286
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:08,240
so it is recommend to use uplink

287
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:10,000
for instant apps

288
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,880
you can see the correct configs in this

289
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:15,360
feature

290
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:18,880
and we found that we can turn local

291
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:21,200
attack into remote attack by google

292
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,880
instant app

293
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,880
under normal situation

294
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:28,320
if you want to check the user's app

295
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:31,279
you'll need to trick the user to

296
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:33,279
download and

297
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:36,959
install the multi-course application

298
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:38,240
first

299
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:41,040
location and then

300
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:43,279
the modification application sensor

301
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:47,680
sends an intent to attack the user's app

302
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:49,440
since the intent

303
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:50,959
sensor instant

304
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:54,320
app does not need to be installed

305
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:56,639
so while it can be

306
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:58,720
possible to direct

307
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:02,880
directly click on a multi-core link

308
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:06,240
the multi-link will open the instant app

309
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:08,160
and then

310
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:11,199
use and then use the your instant app to

311
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:14,560
attack the user's app

312
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:18,440
overall google instance has a

313
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:20,959
retraction on the communication between

314
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:23,360
instant app and the normal apps by the

315
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:25,519
way found that this type of tag is

316
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:26,959
possible

317
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:32,079
and this is a normal local attack case

318
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:36,320
then this is a case while the instant

319
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:39,440
app was opened by cleaning a multicast

320
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:40,480
link

321
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:41,279
and

322
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:42,839
successfully

323
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:45,440
attacked we turn

324
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:48,560
the local attacker volunteer into a

325
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:51,760
remote one click tag through the instant

326
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,680
app

327
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:57,040
okay now i will hand it over to xeon to

328
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:59,839
show you the next

329
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:01,920
thing

330
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:05,519
and i'm sure the third part of hijacking

331
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:09,199
the google pwa app

332
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:12,240
google pww app is not like instant app

333
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,079
or app clips

334
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:15,519
is web app

335
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:18,880
but it's not a traditional web app

336
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:22,480
bigger play also aims to solve customer

337
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,240
needs

338
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:28,000
it is fast and instable readable and

339
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,480
engaging

340
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:31,920
you can see

341
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:34,720
the picture in the right panel

342
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:37,279
pitabay is not is different with a

343
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:41,160
traditional web app

344
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:45,279
and this is a basic pwa usage flow if

345
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:48,240
you log into a website before

346
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:50,720
traditionally if you want to open it in

347
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:51,600
app

348
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:54,560
you'll need insta app and then login

349
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:55,600
again

350
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,600
but in pw app

351
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:58,959
if i click

352
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:00,000
install

353
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:00,959
the

354
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:03,519
database you don't need to login or

355
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:05,600
authorization again

356
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:08,600
so

357
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:10,480
there is a basic

358
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:14,000
structure of dwa ip

359
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,120
is consists with three parts

360
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,480
html

361
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:21,279
connection with atps

362
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:23,920
it means a secure page

363
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:27,360
and also a file manifest.json

364
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:31,839
it seems like android manufactured timer

365
00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:35,680
developers can define name shown name

366
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:38,480
and icon in it

367
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:41,519
and also validate a server worker

368
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:44,240
it will handle before install promote

369
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:46,959
event and offline for bank

370
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:49,959
event

371
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:55,040
this is a typical pwa app workflow

372
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,160
it can

373
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:59,440
catch resources and preface resources so

374
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:02,639
you can use it offline yes

375
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:06,000
it is different with version web app and

376
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,079
all

377
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:13,599
ok i will give you the example case for

378
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:15,919
hijacking pw app

379
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:17,599
you can

380
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:19,439
see it in this picture

381
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:22,640
there is a pwa default install promotes

382
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,240
screen

383
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:26,799
can we control it as we want

384
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:29,839
the answer is yes

385
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:34,400
you can see the picture on the slide

386
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:38,000
i can control the website domain

387
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,480
i type

388
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:41,679
zw.google.com on it

389
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:45,799
for the victim trustee

390
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:50,399
take a look about this poc code

391
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:55,679
as shown in this picture we inset

392
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:59,200
our cif code into pwm

393
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:02,000
and first i don't realize that this is a

394
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:02,880
bug

395
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:05,120
but when i open it in android chrome

396
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:06,160
browser

397
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:08,559
the magic sense happened

398
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:11,440
google doesn't on the new lines

399
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:14,240
we can control this dialog

400
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:16,240
just using two simple

401
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:18,720
symbols

402
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:23,360
after pw app installed

403
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:27,799
convey hijacking it again

404
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:31,600
the answer is yes

405
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:35,600
as a slide showing i installed black

406
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:38,640
pwa app has low address bar and will

407
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,160
show an apb

408
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:43,600
domain in app info validate

409
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,039
convey overlay

410
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:48,160
the information of app info validate or

411
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,480
pro out to the address bar

412
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:54,520
partial round domain

413
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:01,120
how could we achieve this goal

414
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:04,720
we can use a special protocol blob

415
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,880
you can say it in this picture

416
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:11,280
if we create an open blob url in pwai

417
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,240
window

418
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:15,039
the domain information in iphone info

419
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:19,039
web case will be showing as blank

420
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:21,919
but until this step victim still cannot

421
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:25,600
trust this pw app because he don't say

422
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:26,799
any

423
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:29,280
domain he can trust it

424
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:30,000
so

425
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,520
we should give them the domain

426
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:38,640
and the plc code is very simple we just

427
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,080
setting

428
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:43,280
document the title to a domain

429
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:44,440
like

430
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:47,200
zw.google.com the adjustment will be

431
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,600
pull out and show the webpage title as

432
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:50,720
domain

433
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:51,760
so

434
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:56,320
victim will trust it after this step

435
00:19:58,880 --> 00:19:59,919
okay

436
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:02,720
let's go through our fourth part

437
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:05,840
and analyze a quick app and now achieve

438
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:09,439
the rc on it

439
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:11,440
the quick app

440
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:13,840
is funded by quick app

441
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:15,919
urine organization

442
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:17,520
oppo

443
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,039
xiaomi

444
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:20,480
or are huawei

445
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:22,240
in this organization

446
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:25,520
and in the red panel i gave a picture it

447
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:28,400
is a basic structure of quick app

448
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:31,120
it runs on quick app engine which is a

449
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:33,120
little android app

450
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:34,960
all these are running on the android

451
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,640
system

452
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:39,200
quick app engine interacts with the

453
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,679
application through the chrome

454
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:42,960
way 8

455
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,159
engine

456
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:46,480
and also it can access hardware and

457
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:49,840
sensors directly

458
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:52,559
ok

459
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:54,080
in this picture

460
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:56,960
there is a landscape of quick app

461
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:59,120
data transfer

462
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:01,600
quick app has a view layer and logic

463
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:02,480
layer

464
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:05,200
they are run on javascript engine

465
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:07,200
and the engine is responsible for

466
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,559
processing

467
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:12,559
data and storage data also notification

468
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:15,200
process manager studios monitor

469
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,200
is also included in

470
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,320
engine

471
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:21,360
also acting as a middle

472
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:23,760
between the hardware and the

473
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:28,470
upper application paper page

474
00:21:28,470 --> 00:21:31,440
[Music]

475
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:34,400
pang files and sector methods is the

476
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,919
first step to

477
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:38,240
developer or quick app

478
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:41,840
in order to secure this one google app

479
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:44,320
and signature message

480
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,440

481
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:47,919
256

482
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:51,840
is performed on each file in this rpk

483
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:56,080
package apk panchi is a

484
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:59,760
form of quick app the file name and the

485
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:01,440
corresponding

486
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:04,080
figures manual are stored in

487
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:06,880
hashtag.json you can see it in this

488
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:09,280
picture

489
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:13,039
after all files are packaged

490
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:15,520
size the iip function will be used to

491
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:17,039
sign again

492
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:19,120
function size apps you will use the

493
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:21,919
search by kit and the privacy key to

494
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:25,039
cite each section of the zip file

495
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:29,679
binaries and store it in binary

496
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:33,039
after packet is banked

497
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:35,760
this is a

498
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:39,039
packed size the ip will be used to sign

499
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:41,840
again

500
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:43,679
and

501
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:45,440
function that people use the site again

502
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:48,480
and to each section of this ip file file

503
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:51,200
in binary

504
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:53,360
after pancakes

505
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:56,559
pancake necessity download and

506
00:22:56,559 --> 00:22:58,159
install flow

507
00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:01,679
when a user click the hemp deep link

508
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:04,960
or click it in quick app store

509
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,799
client will send a

510
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:10,320
request to remember to validate the

511
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:12,240
package name

512
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:14,640
after it collect will receive

513
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:17,679
the icon and rpk package resources from

514
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:20,400
the server and store it

515
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,200
to

516
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,400
cache folder

517
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,559
in the quick app engine privacy

518
00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:26,559
directories

519
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:29,520
but in a download process

520
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:32,480
it is adp protocol and

521
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:35,039
no verification will be processed

522
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:36,720
so we can

523
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:39,280
make a map in the middle tank

524
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:41,840
we can replace the real rpk package with

525
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:44,799
our evo apk package

526
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:45,679
and

527
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:48,320
exclude any comments

528
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:53,279
but it's just a fake command exclusion

529
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:57,679
when is the real rce

530
00:23:57,679 --> 00:23:59,600
just one click

531
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,440
could this come true

532
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,120
yes

533
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:05,520
we will show how to

534
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:08,080
achieve this

535
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:10,640
to achieve rce on android we possibly

536
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:13,840
can write a evo file to privacy to excel

537
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:16,880
and force the relative vibe to load it

538
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:20,000
so we need to find the file access api

539
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,159
fortunately we found a lot of api

540
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:24,480
supporting the situation

541
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:26,799
like like download file file system

542
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:29,279
manager

543
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:33,120
after some

544
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:35,520
some research we found download file api

545
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:37,679
from remote server is the best choice to

546
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:40,000
explore

547
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,080
download file api will face your file

548
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:45,520
from remote server hp or gps are all

549
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:47,120
supported

550
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:51,600
and related to a temple file paths

551
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:52,640
so

552
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:54,000
can we performance the pencil

553
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,960
transformer tank

554
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:59,520
in this picture we write an evol so

555
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:00,960
plugin into

556
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:04,559
library main folder

557
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:09,360
and in this picture

558
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:11,600
we successfully write an ebook so plug

559
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:15,440
into privacy directory live but until

560
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:18,159
this step we just need to force the

561
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:22,320
quake app engine to load this library

562
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:28,799
after sometimes trying where do they

563
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:30,240
score

564
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:32,559
lab imagine pipeline also is

565
00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:34,320
successfully loaded

566
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:38,158
we can exclude any commands

567
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:44,240
when yours unsafe to go to

568
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:45,679
remote shell

569
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:47,840
and on the tanker side

570
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:50,640
they get an interactive shell you can

571
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:54,240
see it in this picture

572
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:58,559
so this is a fortune to guide rc on

573
00:25:58,559 --> 00:25:59,919
quick app

574
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:02,400
well victim click deep link

575
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,039
or

576
00:26:04,039 --> 00:26:07,679
illuminantly touch the nfc tank

577
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:09,440
we can mention

578
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:12,080
quick app directly and then call the

579
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:15,120
download file api to write a usb plugin

580
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:17,760
to folder library main

581
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:20,159
then send an interactive shell to a

582
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:23,159
tanker

583
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:26,640
and

584
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:28,000
and last

585
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,039
the main content of our talk is over

586
00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:34,640
here is a summary and a takeaways

587
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:38,159
first is congruence

588
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:40,640
when make a story suggestion for

589
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,000
developers

590
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,600
the first you

591
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:46,720
secure the interfaces of installers apps

592
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:49,520
would reduce the security risk

593
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:51,200
effectively

594
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,400
and the second

595
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:56,480
one is the legitimacy of links and files

596
00:26:56,480 --> 00:27:00,159
also helps with those security risks

597
00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:03,120
and the last one is developers need to

598
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:06,480
pay more attention to the private apis

599
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:09,360
provided by the system especially file

600
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:12,559
operation apis

601
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:14,880
and the

602
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:17,360
last part is takeaways

603
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:20,000
in this talk we provided the offensive

604
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,120
landscape

605
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:23,600
of installers apps

606
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:26,640
and we may have shared some new tango

607
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:27,679
vectors

608
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:29,919
in apple app clips

609
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:32,320
google pww google instant app and a

610
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:35,039
quick app

611
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:36,240
and third

612
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:38,240
we have to show you some

613
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:38,910
suggestion

614
00:27:38,910 --> 00:27:40,559
[Music]

615
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:42,080
for developers

616
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:45,200
how to check if your application is also

617
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:46,640
affected

618
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:49,600
and some mitigation technicals

619
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:52,719
to against them

620
00:27:55,279 --> 00:28:00,279
and this question and answer

621
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:13,918
you
