excited to be back here as a member of

5
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:26,400
the review board and also as a member of

6
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:29,599
the infosec community i am presenting

7
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:31,920
today a talk called vibe check i don't

8
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:34,079
know about this why students may shy

9
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:38,079
away from cyber in a surveillance state

10
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:41,280
first a bit about me my name is mika

11
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,360
devonshire i am an incident responder

12
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:46,079
and cyber crime investigator by day i

13
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:47,520
like to say

14
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,039
and was an assistant professor of

15
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:51,840
malware by night i have spent about a

16
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,320
decade in the information security space

17
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,079
in everything from

18
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:59,120
defense so blue team network defense

19
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:01,920
vulnerability management and operations

20
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:04,000
to a bit of offensive security and

21
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,519
systems engineering

22
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:07,920
i've also participated on different

23
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:11,280
kinds of research groups and

24
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,680
capture the flag hacking training groups

25
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,119
outside of work

26
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:18,560
and in addition also uh enjoy you know

27
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:20,080
connecting and networking with with

28
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,680
females and cyber security through a lot

29
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,280
of these different means

30
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:24,640
here are some ways to stay in touch with

31
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:27,920
me if you want to talk more after this

32
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:29,920
either on linkedin or twitter and of

33
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:30,799
course

34
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:32,079
i'll stick around after this

35
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:33,759
presentation to talk to you all and

36
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:35,360
hopefully hear some questions and engage

37
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:37,520
with you on this very topic

38
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:39,680
i do have to say at the gate that i'm

39
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,520
not a lawyer and nothing in this talk

40
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,600
should be misconstrued as legal advice

41
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,759
or anything that

42
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:47,280
can be considered

43
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,119
advice by a lawyer because i'm not

44
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:51,439
qualified or trained as such um in terms

45
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:53,360
of my qualifications i've done a lot of

46
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,920
the training and certifications that

47
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,240
many of us go through in this field

48
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:59,920
i have my gcfa

49
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:00,880
cis

50
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,640
certified ethical hacker network plus

51
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,240
security plus and and some of those

52
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:05,439
other ones

53
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:06,799
it's just a quick way of saying that

54
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:08,639
i've spent a lot of time in this field

55
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:10,878
and truly enjoy and am passionate about

56
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:14,000
information security

57
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,920
so what started this talk why are we

58
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,840
here today and why are we talking about

59
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,040
education

60
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:23,840
in

61
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:26,239
the asia pacific region and what the

62
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:27,840
implications of the security state might

63
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,120
be on that

64
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,920
um the origin of this story is basically

65
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:34,800
fall of 2019 when i was an assistant

66
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,959
professor of malware analysis on hong

67
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:38,720
kong university campus

68
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,800
i thoroughly enjoyed my time there we

69
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,720
were teaching about system internals

70
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:46,480
windows internals memory analysis

71
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:49,040
code analysis both static and dynamic

72
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,519
where you get to interact with students

73
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:53,360
who are detonating their first piece of

74
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:56,239
malware setting up their first sandbox

75
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:57,840
and also really understanding the

76
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,480
connection between program execution

77
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,159
and

78
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:04,720
actions on objectives so what happens

79
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,879
after you've trained and taught someone

80
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:08,400
what to look for in an environment

81
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,560
that's what we forensic investigators do

82
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,319
um this class kind of gives you all that

83
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:14,879
foundation as to how malware really

84
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:16,480
works and what to look for in terms of

85
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,480
system artifacts

86
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,000
that said

87
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,760
the climate on hong kong university's

88
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,760
campus in the fall of 2019 was a bit

89
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,920
different than you're probably used to

90
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:28,879
on a standard university campus

91
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:31,040
i can only present as an outsider who

92
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:33,280
had the privilege and and

93
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,680
opportunity to teach on campus

94
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:38,239
that i felt very humbled by the campus

95
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:39,840
environment um

96
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,319
i was able to also talk with some of my

97
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:44,480
students before and after

98
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:47,440
our semester and got to thinking about

99
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:50,319
how that would impact anyone's education

100
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:52,080
um and that pivotal

101
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,840
time in your life where you're trying to

102
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,599
develop your career path you're trying

103
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:58,080
to understand you know how you will

104
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,920
will enter the workforce and what you'll

105
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:03,040
be looking to do moving forward

106
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,560
so

107
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,720
i got to speaking with some of my old

108
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:09,519
students and collected some testimonials

109
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:11,599
because the topic of information

110
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:14,319
security is very much so tied to data

111
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:16,478
privacy and data security

112
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:18,478
and of course we we talk about there

113
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:21,358
being a lot of surveillance around the

114
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:23,120
area

115
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:23,919
and

116
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:26,000
just in hearing some of their their

117
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,400
responses to my questions it really did

118
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,720
seem like surveillance was influencing

119
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,160
whether or not they would choose to

120
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,759
pursue information security as a

121
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:35,840
profession and particularly whether they

122
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,199
would continue with malware

123
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:40,560
investigation after the semester

124
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:44,160
all in all the the main outcome of that

125
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,960
was that there weren't as many students

126
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:49,440
interested in it as i wanted you know i

127
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:52,240
couldn't hire um any of these these

128
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,479
bright young individuals to join my

129
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:57,040
company of course and i really wanted to

130
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,960
dive into why that was

131
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,479
so the purpose of this talk is to kind

132
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:02,240
of communicate some of those findings

133
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,600
and also

134
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,840
expand on what i found across the asia

135
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,919
pacific region with some other use cases

136
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:10,479
or case studies and

137
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:13,440
stories just about why students do or do

138
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,919
not enter the hacking space

139
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:18,960
why they choose to pursue safer careers

140
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,880
and you know how we're going to fill

141
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:23,440
this this skills gap and this job

142
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,479
shortage

143
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:25,360
that

144
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:28,560
some estimates put as high as 4 million

145
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:31,120
jobs worldwide that we can't fill due to

146
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,720
the lack of trained and skilled

147
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:35,280
information security practitioners

148
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,680
so let's talk about that for a bit and

149
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:40,080
discuss why this problem needs to be

150
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,479
solved and what we can do about it

151
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:44,240
so this will this talk will primarily

152
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,400
put some color to why i think

153
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,800
the students aren't eager to enter the

154
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:51,600
field and clarify some of the reasons

155
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,639
why that

156
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:54,080
should be

157
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:57,280
changing moving forward

158
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,800
so one student's testimonial simply said

159
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:03,840
in plain

160
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,360
plain text that there's not enough

161
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,600
interest to pursue cyber security

162
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,360
professionally

163
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:12,160
i think that comes up

164
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,600
a lot of times when you're speaking with

165
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:17,039
analysts or penetration testers that

166
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:20,240
kind of see it as a stagnating field

167
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,400
that oh you know you can you could spend

168
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,840
a lot of time

169
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,680
training and getting certified and

170
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,759
qualified for all this

171
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:28,880
but they're just not interested in

172
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,560
moving it forward because other jobs

173
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:33,440
might be more prestigious and whatnot

174
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,600
this is the main the main point that i

175
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,919
want to try to upend with this talk is

176
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:39,280
that there's not enough interest to

177
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,199
pursue cyber security professionally

178
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:44,560
whereas i will argue that there is

179
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,479
reason number one that i heard from a

180
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:50,240
lot of these testimonials and that i

181
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,800
find across all the literature is that

182
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,080
they're afraid they're afraid of the

183
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,960
consequences of joining the field um

184
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:59,120
and they believe that if they're

185
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:02,160
involved in any kind of uh

186
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:05,199
illicit or even gray area behavior

187
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:06,960
which is what it takes to become an

188
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,360
ethical hacker and to gain those skills

189
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,520
in order to be able to access networks

190
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,840
or exploit vulnerabilities and show

191
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,840
proofs of concept that these

192
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:18,240
vulnerabilities are exploitable

193
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,240
they're just afraid of being involved in

194
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,479
that at all due to

195
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:24,000
political circumstances that we'll talk

196
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,599
about in a second

197
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:28,080
second is a lack of interest so

198
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,520
students are not

199
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:32,000
really seeing this as a career path that

200
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,560
will sustain them for a long time it may

201
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,080
seem niche or interesting for a period

202
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,639
of time but not long enough and

203
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:41,280
they they genuinely are more intrigued

204
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:44,479
by things like ai or data science or

205
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:46,639
coding or development if they have any

206
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:48,560
technical skills at all

207
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:51,360
and then third lack of prestige so some

208
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:54,319
students find that they're

209
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:56,479
not going to be as revered or admired

210
00:07:56,479 --> 00:07:58,479
for entering a field like ethical

211
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:01,759
hacking where they could be at a bank

212
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:03,919
in i.t administration or

213
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:06,400
architecting large networks and have

214
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,919
what they believe a more prestigious

215
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:10,159
role

216
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:12,160
so to touch on sort of the backbone that

217
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,000
draws all these together especially in

218
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,919
the in the vein of fear

219
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:18,479
is you know that idea of what is a

220
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:20,560
surveillance state surveillance refers

221
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,879
to the way that an area is designed or a

222
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:24,800
country is designed or security

223
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:27,599
apparatus is designed to minimize

224
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:29,680
the risk of crime so you want to reduce

225
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,919
the crime rate by increasing the amount

226
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:34,640
of watchful eyes and you want to

227
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,320
encourage good behavior by letting

228
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,760
people know that their behavior is being

229
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:38,880
observed

230
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:41,279
and that there are consequences on bad

231
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:42,479
behavior

232
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:43,839
so how this manifests in a lot of

233
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:45,360
countries is that there are zero

234
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,959
tolerance policies

235
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:48,800
so first strike offense

236
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:51,040
means grave or serious consequences it

237
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:53,440
could be in terms of fines or

238
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:56,800
jail time or things of that nature

239
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,320
but there really are some harsh

240
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,320
penalties for breaking the laws as as

241
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,080
many of us know

242
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:04,480
another way that surveillance is

243
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,160
deployed is through

244
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:09,200
uh closed circuit television cameras so

245
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,279
across the asia pacific region there are

246
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:13,920
a lot of um you know and and everywhere

247
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,680
really there are smart cameras that can

248
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,200
not only monitor

249
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:21,680
for um movement and behavior and facial

250
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,040
recognition there's also image

251
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:25,040
recognition and then there are large

252
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:27,120
backend databases and things like that

253
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,519
but close circuit television another one

254
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:31,440
of these watch towers

255
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,880
that's observed

256
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:35,120
lighting on streets is a simple way to

257
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,360
to kind of show what's happening in a

258
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,959
given region

259
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:40,560
and then of course the one at the bottom

260
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,800
is the one that most students who are

261
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,800
afraid of ethical hacking will state as

262
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:47,839
being their primary concern which is

263
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:49,760
you know what is being monitored by the

264
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:52,800
isp and how is their activity online

265
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,640
being traced and followed

266
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,560
if you are to participate in a capture

267
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,720
the flag competition or you're looking

268
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,160
to

269
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,480
participate in hack the box or pawn to

270
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:05,839
own or any of these competitions

271
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:08,160
is that seen as a negative and if you're

272
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,560
just trying to research ways of breaking

273
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,000
into

274
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,399
different places or exploiting smb

275
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:17,279
vulnerabilities or cracking ssh

276
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:19,680
passwords with weak ciphers

277
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,600
all of this all has to do

278
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,920
with that fear and if you can't overcome

279
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:27,360
that fear of being monitored surveilled

280
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:31,160
you wouldn't enter the field

281
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:34,000
so that kind of paints the picture and

282
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,320
as we look at this graph you know the

283
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,560
number of countries just on this top 10

284
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,160
list that are that are over in asia

285
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,200
pacific

286
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,120
include china singapore

287
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:46,160
australia hong kong and india obviously

288
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,760
very large populations but you think

289
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,839
about singapore having very strict rules

290
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:51,120
the philippines

291
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:54,240
um also having very strict rules

292
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,320
against criminal activity

293
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:58,560
there are many places in the world that

294
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:01,040
kind of pair that surveillance with that

295
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,959
increased um

296
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:07,119
zero tolerance for punishment policy

297
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:11,440
so on the first reason fear um

298
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,040
again just going back to being in hong

299
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,800
kong and kind of understanding that

300
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,959
there was a lot going on and not really

301
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:18,880
understanding exactly where

302
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:21,680
and when activities were taking place

303
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,200
i knew that at a certain point i could

304
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,800
pull back and find some source of

305
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,560
information just given the number of

306
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,079
security cameras and surveillance

307
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:29,680
footage that was around

308
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,760
so this is a screenshot from

309
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:35,200
my work computer one day i found a feed

310
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:38,000
that was able to pull feeds from traffic

311
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,200
cameras

312
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,440
news stations

313
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,360
even people live streaming from their

314
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,959
phones to different social media

315
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:46,480
networks

316
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,320
this one website would pull all of those

317
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,160
images together and sort of live stream

318
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,079
to you what was happening and give you

319
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:54,160
situational awareness where otherwise

320
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,079
there really was none because what's

321
00:11:56,079 --> 00:11:58,480
reported on television may show one view

322
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:01,279
of activity um and then you know you can

323
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:03,040
kind of triangulate that with everything

324
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,959
else that's happening so when you think

325
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:06,160
about that

326
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,920
surveillance really does give you that

327
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:10,560
holistic view of what's happening

328
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,480
from all angles and you can enrich that

329
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,480
data with intelligence and try to

330
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,560
understand more about that but why would

331
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,800
that be discouraging

332
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,800
if you are curious about internet

333
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:23,519
security and curious about weak internet

334
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:24,800
protocols

335
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,000
it makes sense that you would want to

336
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,560
explore that more

337
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,720
well what came very clear from the

338
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:33,519
testimonial provided by students

339
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:36,639
was that there is not a great amount of

340
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:39,920
legal education that helps inform which

341
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:42,079
activities are strictly prohibited

342
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:44,560
and which activities are permitted under

343
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:45,600
law

344
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,600
so it's very hard in the student's

345
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,680
opinion to judge what is prohibited and

346
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:51,279
what's not

347
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:52,959
that said

348
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:54,959
there are some common ways that we can

349
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:56,720
try to overcome this

350
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:57,519
and

351
00:12:57,519 --> 00:12:59,680
help bring a little bit more

352
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:02,000
clarification to those students as to

353
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:02,959
what

354
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:07,839
uh what isn't is not legal

355
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:09,760
so how can we clarify the student's

356
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:12,800
question as to what is prohibited and

357
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:15,120
what is allowed under law

358
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,880
the greatest place to start is by

359
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:19,120
looking to the country codes themselves

360
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:21,600
and getting familiar with what the rules

361
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:24,000
strictly state is prohibited

362
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,639
so knowing the rules is the first step

363
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,880
in really getting comfortable with what

364
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:31,440
is and is not good behavior and a lot of

365
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:33,120
this is intuitive

366
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,040
knowing when you're doing something for

367
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,639
the purpose of education or for the

368
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:39,519
purpose of harm

369
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:41,279
it will become clear over time but i

370
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:43,440
hope that most people will

371
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,279
will be familiar with at least some of

372
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:46,399
these

373
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:50,240
acts and and statutes that govern our

374
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,000
online behavior

375
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,800
so just a few from the aipac region and

376
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,320
one from the u.s

377
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,240
that can be

378
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:00,560
looked at read here and there they all

379
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:02,399
share very similar

380
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:05,600
core tenants which basically discuss you

381
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,839
know what is a

382
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:09,519
computer system right they'll always

383
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:11,440
start with the definition of that

384
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:12,959
and in this day and age it's really

385
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:15,120
anything that that can process

386
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,839
data and is or is not sometimes

387
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:19,760
connected to the internet and those

388
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,760
standards vary by country

389
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:25,440
but in singapore the computer misuse act

390
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:28,240
hong kong has a cap 200 crimes ordinance

391
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,680
the u.s has the

392
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,360
slightly outdated but

393
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:32,800
you know it's going it's going through

394
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,320
some iterations the computer fraud and

395
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,320
abuse act as well as the information and

396
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:38,880
technology act and the philippines has

397
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:42,320
the crime prevention act of 2012.

398
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,079
what you'll find in many countries is

399
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:44,959
that

400
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:47,360
defining what is legal and illegal

401
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,920
behavior comes down to identifying

402
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:52,560
what is the intent or the motive of the

403
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,160
individual's actions

404
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,399
so if the individual's actions show an

405
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:59,760
intent to be dishonest or to deceive or

406
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:02,000
to misuse the system for purposes that

407
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,079
it's not meant to be used for there's

408
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:06,079
typically some outcome that need that it

409
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:07,600
needs to be weighed against in order to

410
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:10,959
be deemed illegal or to be

411
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:12,560
weighed on the level of some sort of

412
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:14,079
criminal activity

413
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:15,680
so you would have to prove that either a

414
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,839
certain amount of damage was done um

415
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:19,680
that that individual was acting

416
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,360
malicious intent

417
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:24,160
or just in general that this cyber crime

418
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:26,480
has caused any sort of impact to the

419
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,959
regular operations of things so

420
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:30,320
this sounds very vague but it can

421
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:32,560
actually be very specific so knowing the

422
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:34,079
rules reading them becoming familiar

423
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:36,399
with them is certainly one way to sort

424
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:38,720
of set yourself up and set your students

425
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,320
up

426
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,160
to to be

427
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:44,160
more vigilant and understand what the

428
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:47,920
boundaries are that they should follow

429
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:50,399
another concern that was raised beyond

430
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:53,040
just the legal aspects are that there

431
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,639
are background checks

432
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:55,839
so

433
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:58,720
you know how can i feel comfortable

434
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:01,600
going to a job interview when they might

435
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:04,399
see that i was researching um

436
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:06,560
you know eternal blue vulnerabilities or

437
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:09,600
playing with uh

438
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:13,440
the dmv the the vulnerable web app

439
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,279
online and learning how to hack on my

440
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:16,399
free time

441
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:19,120
well some might admire that as you know

442
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:21,680
educational curiosity and encourage that

443
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,120
kind of behavior

444
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,800
but it does also sound like others are

445
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,720
skeptical that that this could come up

446
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,240
on a background check and that this

447
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:30,399
could wind up

448
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:31,600
being something that's seen as a

449
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:34,959
negative mark so again in in places

450
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:36,880
where information is readily available

451
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,959
about your background about your history

452
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:39,920
um

453
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:42,240
about perhaps your browsing activity you

454
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,000
know it is important to also be able to

455
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,199
defend your character in those cases so

456
00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:49,839
on to this end i would suggest that you

457
00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:51,199
know really take a look at your whole

458
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:52,639
picture have you been studying

459
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:55,360
information security for a while um do

460
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:58,079
you do you genuinely lead a

461
00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:00,399
lead a decent

462
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:02,000
decent life and you're interested in

463
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,240
joining the company because you want to

464
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:05,839
contribute to their mission

465
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:07,760
there are a lot of factors outside of

466
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:10,480
what you choose to pursue academically

467
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:12,319
that would round out this kind of

468
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:14,959
profile and frankly a lot of us in the

469
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:16,480
information security community do what

470
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:18,559
we do because we're concerned about bad

471
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:21,760
we want to you know protect we want to

472
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:25,520
defend and we want to root out

473
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,280
any sort of vulnerability or weakness in

474
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:29,919
an environment to genuinely improve the

475
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:32,000
state of that network so what i would

476
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,160
say on this is also

477
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:36,880
you know instead of being found out

478
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:37,760
um

479
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,600
or something like that really wrap your

480
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,960
head around

481
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:43,360
what it is that makes you unique in your

482
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:45,520
job interview and not worry so much

483
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:47,520
about your your browsing behavior

484
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,039
especially if you've kind of clarified

485
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:51,120
that everything you've done in an

486
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:54,320
academic sense has not violated any laws

487
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:56,720
i think in general um this is this is

488
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,400
not something to be as concerned about

489
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:59,280
and

490
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:01,919
could hold back a lot of really uh

491
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:03,919
fantastic talent from pursuing

492
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:06,960
information security

493
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,919
so on this you know what are the do's

494
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:11,360
and don'ts because that's really the

495
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:12,880
outcome of this talk

496
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:14,720
so do learn the laws of your country

497
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:17,200
spend time researching and reading what

498
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:20,559
it is that that you should be aware of

499
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:21,840
roots and case studies and i'm

500
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:24,400
presenting some now of people that did

501
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,640
not necessarily observe or abide the

502
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,559
rules abide by the rules

503
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:30,720
and then the number one role in ethical

504
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,880
hacking and you'll hear this in any

505
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:35,200
training

506
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,960
is that you really do always want to

507
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:39,760
obtain authority and clarify the scope

508
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:41,039
before

509
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:43,280
getting into any sort of ethical hacking

510
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:45,760
engagement

511
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:46,559
and

512
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:49,840
obtaining authority can also be

513
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:52,000
very important if you're just learning

514
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,799
for the first time

515
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:56,559
say you're you're trying to test your

516
00:18:56,559 --> 00:18:59,039
skills in kali linux and you download a

517
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:00,880
virtual machine from

518
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:03,679
a wasp or sans and you want to practice

519
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:05,360
in a private range

520
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:08,000
that is typically permissible and again

521
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,640
you'll be given some some consents to

522
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,960
probably sign before you download a lot

523
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,799
of these vulnerable applications i

524
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:18,000
highly recommend you always research

525
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,240
research research and make sure that

526
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:21,919
what you're doing is safe

527
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:24,400
um i personally have accidentally

528
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,160
escaped a sandbox

529
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:28,960
on a campus network and was thoroughly

530
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:31,760
embarrassed and very apologetic and was

531
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:34,960
banned from the network for a month

532
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:37,360
because i didn't read through all of the

533
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:40,080
best practices for protecting that vm

534
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:42,320
and not putting my

535
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,480
network adapter in bridge mode

536
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:46,880
so always obtain authority clarify the

537
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:48,480
scope but also really read and

538
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,320
understand what it is that you're

539
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:53,360
experimenting with prior to jumping in

540
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:55,760
and embarking on on some of these and

541
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,520
also if if you

542
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,840
obtain some great skills in your owasp

543
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:03,039
or your ceh or your oscp training

544
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:04,880
don't try to apply them somewhere that

545
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:07,520
you have no authority so don't look down

546
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:10,000
the street and say that that looks like

547
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,480
a network that could resemble what you

548
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:14,799
trained on in class

549
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:16,799
it's very important that you always have

550
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:19,200
clear boundaries as to what you are and

551
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,799
are not allowed to do and you have

552
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:23,280
consent of whatever network it is that

553
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:25,600
you're you're attempting to

554
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,360
learn and train on

555
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,360
the do nots are do not assume that what

556
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:30,799
you're doing is legal

557
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:32,960
uh do not export or obtain sensitive

558
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,799
information needlessly and that really

559
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:36,880
is the clause that runs common and

560
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,640
similar to most of these legal

561
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,559
frameworks is that if there is some

562
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:43,039
intent or if there's some

563
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:45,840
type of fraud or intent to defraud that

564
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:47,520
is really what

565
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:49,760
makes this a criminal activity

566
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:51,840
and do not misuse computer resources to

567
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:53,840
negatively impact systems

568
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:56,080
so unfortunately many of the denial of

569
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:58,080
service attacks we hear about

570
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:59,840
um where it's a script kitty who

571
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:03,120
downloaded lower but ion cannon or

572
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:05,840
some other tool to just fire

573
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:08,320
um fire and attack

574
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:10,080
and actually take down

575
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:12,559
you know significant number of websites

576
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:14,480
all of that could have been avoided by

577
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,799
just a little bit more edification and

578
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:18,720
clarification around what should and

579
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:21,440
should not be targeted um and again

580
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:23,280
learn the laws and obtain authority

581
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:25,520
clarify scope before

582
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:29,039
embarking on one of these um

583
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:31,200
so then moving on in a surveillance

584
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,360
state uh this this student said that he

585
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:36,000
was concerned that only legal careers

586
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,919
that would be available to him

587
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:40,000
would be uh cyber security careers where

588
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,600
he would have to join the state so this

589
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,360
moves into that next

590
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:45,840
reason i see as to why students aren't

591
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:47,440
choosing to pursue

592
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,280
cyber security is that they think that

593
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:52,240
their options are limited

594
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:53,360
well

595
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:55,600
that's not necessarily the case and i

596
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:56,840
will say that

597
00:21:56,840 --> 00:22:00,400
because you know having worked in fields

598
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,240
including you know government

599
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,159
contracting but also

600
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:05,440
um

601
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:07,600
you know private sector

602
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:10,080
there are options at each bank at each

603
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:12,720
insurance company at each

604
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:15,120
major tech company at each interesting

605
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:17,440
new startup at each data science company

606
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:19,280
to do this kind of ethical hacking and

607
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:21,200
to do this kind of interesting security

608
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,320
research that doesn't

609
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:26,640
necessitate your joining a police force

610
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:27,520
or

611
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,080
some sort of

612
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:32,640
public sector

613
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:34,240
field of employment

614
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:36,000
so on that

615
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,440
his concern was that he would be

616
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,440
implementing and reinforcing the

617
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:40,559
surveillance

618
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:43,360
by joining that type of career

619
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:44,960
this is not to say that that

620
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,400
surveillance will

621
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,640
wane or change depending on your type of

622
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:51,120
career but there are certainly

623
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:53,039
opportunities to work

624
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:55,840
in security in private sector and and

625
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:58,000
not have to

626
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,039
be part of that public sector

627
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:02,880
but let's discuss a case study that

628
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,640
might shed a bit more light on this as

629
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,320
well

630
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:08,880
there was an australian researcher who

631
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:10,799
was curious and he noticed

632
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:12,880
and again curiosity is fantastic in this

633
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:13,919
field

634
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:15,600
but he noticed a very common id in his

635
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:18,240
bank's url on the statement page so what

636
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:20,880
he did was he sort of tweaked that

637
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:24,240
id and found that he could download

638
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:25,840
financial statements from other

639
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:28,159
individuals as well

640
00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:29,120
so

641
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:31,200
you know

642
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:34,000
that being said could he have stopped at

643
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,720
extracting one or two or three of these

644
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:38,640
ids

645
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:40,559
and extracting only a few financial

646
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:42,000
records yes

647
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,320
uh he then extracted about 500 and

648
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:46,960
that's where you need to know the scope

649
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:49,200
of what you're testing and and what is

650
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,799
appropriate

651
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:52,320
to prove

652
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,600
what you need

653
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,279
in order to report a security

654
00:23:55,279 --> 00:23:56,720
vulnerability

655
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:58,799
so he sent those statements all of them

656
00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:00,799
to the bank directly

657
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:03,279
which is not only violating what he had

658
00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:05,279
authority to do but also the fact that

659
00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:06,960
he was sharing and disseminating that

660
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:09,200
information without the consent of the

661
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:11,200
individual whose financial statement it

662
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,000
was

663
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,760
so bringing this back to

664
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:16,559
intent scope and authority

665
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:18,480
this is a case study whereby that

666
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:22,000
individual was not authorized to access

667
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,200
these uh he was not in a position to be

668
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:28,240
exporting or removing that data

669
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:29,919
and instead of just demonstrating the

670
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:32,000
security flaw in that common id that he

671
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,600
was able to manipulate

672
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:36,720
they then wanted to take legal action um

673
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:39,440
against this security researcher

674
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:41,600
so what does this teach you about you

675
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:42,960
know

676
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:45,039
gaining these hacker skills and then how

677
00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:47,039
to and not to apply them

678
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:48,640
again repeating that you should not go

679
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,400
beyond the reasonable bounds to obtain

680
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:53,120
proof do not publish on impulse

681
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:55,840
um do not try to just send these records

682
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:58,320
over because you could get them

683
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:01,279
there's a great deal of of honesty

684
00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:03,200
involved in this work where you want to

685
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,799
report this vulnerability of course you

686
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:06,480
want to get it fixed

687
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:08,720
but you should work with the process so

688
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:10,960
act with integrity not with pride

689
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:13,360
and some companies will try to find ways

690
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:14,960
to avoid paying you

691
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:16,159
um

692
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:18,240
you know it's it's very encouraging to

693
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:20,159
hear that that and i'll talk about this

694
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:22,320
later that bug bounty programs do pay

695
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,400
out so well and so richly but it's

696
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:26,159
extremely important that you that you

697
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:30,240
not overstep your bounds to obtain proof

698
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:33,279
here's another interesting case study of

699
00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:36,000
what to do and what not to do

700
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,520
and some of you might be familiar with

701
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:38,559
this

702
00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:40,840
but an attendee a researcher from

703
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:43,840
tencent wound up being arrested um by

704
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:46,640
the security bureau for invading the

705
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:49,600
hotel's wi-fi system so he had gone to a

706
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:52,000
conference

707
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,679
and had

708
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:54,799
also

709
00:25:54,799 --> 00:25:57,679
learned some skills about about hacking

710
00:25:57,679 --> 00:25:58,880
systems

711
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:00,000
at this

712
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,440
hospitality

713
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:03,039
institute

714
00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:03,919
and

715
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:05,360
eventually

716
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:08,720
posted that information not just in a in

717
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:11,600
a discrete disclosure to the

718
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:12,720
hotel

719
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:14,400
but also

720
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,960
publicly on his blog post um and he'd

721
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:19,039
publish credentials

722
00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:20,240
and uh

723
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:21,919
and other

724
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:23,360
pieces of information that could have

725
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:25,679
actually been used to cause great harm

726
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:27,919
and although he himself did not carry

727
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:30,480
out any subsequent activities you know

728
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:32,880
there's that fine line between intent

729
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:34,159
and actions

730
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:35,919
so the singapore cyber security

731
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:38,240
authority flagged him and pressed

732
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:41,600
charges he was almost sent to prison but

733
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,360
um was able to state the case that you

734
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:44,880
know he was doing this for for good

735
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,000
reasons

736
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,240
and he walked away with a fine

737
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:50,000
so again

738
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
what not to do do not go beyond the

739
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,919
reasonable bounds to obtain proof so if

740
00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:55,600
he knew that he could get into these

741
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:56,799
systems

742
00:26:56,799 --> 00:26:58,159
um he could have reported that

743
00:26:58,159 --> 00:27:00,640
discreetly to the hotel

744
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:02,559
he didn't really need to publish

745
00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:04,080
anything on impulse he needed to work

746
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:06,159
with this process he needed to act with

747
00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:08,480
integrity not pride and

748
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:09,760
no one was going to pay him at that

749
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:11,679
point he absolutely was going to be

750
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:13,760
fined

751
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:15,200
and i thought this was interesting this

752
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:17,440
came from the researcher that gave me

753
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:19,840
a lead on the story

754
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:21,679
the company did everything

755
00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:23,760
that they should not do which was become

756
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:25,440
defensive and take legal action against

757
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:27,760
the security researcher so in all of

758
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:29,679
these stories you know there's someone

759
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:31,600
at fault

760
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:33,279
and then there's someone who could be

761
00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:34,559
more at fault

762
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:36,960
so the research firm or the security

763
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:39,120
researcher was able to present findings

764
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:40,799
and give a very compelling argument as

765
00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:43,200
to why things should be fixed

766
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:45,440
the company has the onus of accepting

767
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:47,200
that information and trying to fix the

768
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:48,799
problems

769
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:51,440
and it does you know it does

770
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:54,080
reinforce that fear when a company tries

771
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:55,600
to take legal action because you've

772
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:57,520
discovered a vulnerability

773
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:59,360
so it's a delicate line needing to

774
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:01,279
balance what you should be doing how you

775
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:02,559
should be doing it

776
00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:04,240
and then learning from examples like

777
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:05,279
these two

778
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:06,080
uh

779
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:08,000
that that there is a fine line to draw

780
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,840
and you always want to take the high

781
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:11,679
road in order to do this

782
00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:14,880
practically and ethically

783
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:17,120
a final

784
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:18,640
sort of case study that's interesting

785
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:19,760
that also

786
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:21,120
talks about

787
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:23,279
the operational mode of of ethical

788
00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:26,000
hacking is one researcher decided to use

789
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,760
a fake gmail account to submit his

790
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:29,120
findings so when you're going through a

791
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:30,399
bug bounty process

792
00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:33,679
you typically find um

793
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:35,120
you find the vulnerability you find

794
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:36,960
proof of concept and you try to obtain

795
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:37,760
some

796
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:39,039
some

797
00:28:39,039 --> 00:28:40,399
proof of life

798
00:28:40,399 --> 00:28:42,320
or evidence that you can actually

799
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:44,320
exploit this vulnerability further and

800
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:46,799
then you draw a line unfortunately the

801
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:48,399
the company flagged his email as

802
00:28:48,399 --> 00:28:50,480
extortion because he was using a fake

803
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:52,799
name a pseudonym to try to protect his

804
00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:55,279
identity out of fear that he would be

805
00:28:55,279 --> 00:28:58,480
reprimanded or jailed for this

806
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:00,320
and then ultimately when he expressed

807
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:01,760
his grievances

808
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:04,559
you know the company finally conceded

809
00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:06,000
and decided to pay him but this could

810
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,960
have gone very poorly because if he were

811
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:11,360
assuming a false identity

812
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:13,520
he could be accused of actually doing

813
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:15,440
this with malicious intent you know why

814
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:16,320
was it

815
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:18,159
why was he trying to conceal who he was

816
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:21,039
in order to carry out this research

817
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:23,200
so an important lesson here

818
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:24,960
is that you should always use your real

819
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:26,640
name you should use appropriate channels

820
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,880
to communicate vulnerabilities

821
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:31,039
and either directly disclose it to the

822
00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:32,720
company or go through a bug bounty

823
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:34,320
program

824
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:37,200
because in again in these cases you want

825
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:39,360
to be very clear and very above board

826
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:42,159
about who you are and what you're doing

827
00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:44,320
companies can react very poorly to bug

828
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:45,600
disclosures

829
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:48,000
and they can see researchers as a threat

830
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,919
of sorts but ultimately if you're doing

831
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:51,919
this in the best interest of the company

832
00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:54,399
it's best to build trust by showing good

833
00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:57,039
intentions and going through common

834
00:29:57,039 --> 00:29:58,399
uh streams

835
00:29:58,399 --> 00:30:00,399
and and normal swim lanes to communicate

836
00:30:00,399 --> 00:30:02,720
that to the company that needs to hear

837
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:04,799
it

838
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:06,960
so then the last comment on lack of

839
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:08,880
interest and i mean this this does show

840
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:10,640
that there are researchers out there who

841
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:12,080
are either learning of their own

842
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:15,760
volition or participating in larger bug

843
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:17,919
bounty programs to exercise this

844
00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:19,919
interest in ethical hacking

845
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:22,159
or there are researchers who get curious

846
00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:24,320
and poke around a hotel wi-fi

847
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:26,640
um there are a lot of ways that this is

848
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:28,320
of interest and that i would encourage

849
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:30,159
students to pursue this

850
00:30:30,159 --> 00:30:32,559
um if you just go on google and look up

851
00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:34,640
ethical hacking groups near you you'll

852
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:36,960
see that honestly all around the globe

853
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,159
there's a number of wonderful

854
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:39,600
conferences

855
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:41,760
and i will post these in my notes after

856
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:43,760
of you know just all the wonderful

857
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:46,799
groups and meetups that you can pursue

858
00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:49,360
ethical hacking at and these groups that

859
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:51,279
teach you everything from the basics of

860
00:30:51,279 --> 00:30:53,120
web application security

861
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:56,480
to using metasploit to setting up ctfs

862
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:58,640
and i know when i was in washington dc i

863
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:00,720
was a big part of some some great

864
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:03,120
weekend ctfs there there are b-side

865
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:05,279
conferences all over

866
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:07,279
uh there are a lot of opportunities to

867
00:31:07,279 --> 00:31:09,519
learn this and get involved so i think

868
00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:12,240
lack of interest is not a reason to be

869
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:13,440
to be

870
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:15,200
afraid or or

871
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,720
weary of joining

872
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:19,679
this kind of field

873
00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:20,799
so then

874
00:31:20,799 --> 00:31:22,960
again with lack of interest or or lack

875
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:25,120
of prestige you know there was also a

876
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:27,279
common thread that students thought it

877
00:31:27,279 --> 00:31:29,200
was too big of a hurdle or too much

878
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:32,080
burden to train up and certify to be an

879
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:33,519
ethical hacker

880
00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:36,640
or a information security expert or a

881
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:39,279
forensic investigator

882
00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:41,360
and one student actually wrote that well

883
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:43,200
to be a project manager you only need a

884
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:44,559
pmp

885
00:31:44,559 --> 00:31:46,960
seemingly you know just interested in

886
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:49,360
the path of least resistance

887
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:50,880
i just need this one certification and

888
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:53,279
then i can really climb the ranks in all

889
00:31:53,279 --> 00:31:54,799
of these ways

890
00:31:54,799 --> 00:31:56,399
so the reason i will say that this is

891
00:31:56,399 --> 00:31:58,399
not the case is that you know you can

892
00:31:58,399 --> 00:32:00,480
come from any background and be

893
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:02,880
excellent in information security

894
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:04,240
it's really about

895
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:05,679
how you want to

896
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:07,039
pivot your career and where you want to

897
00:32:07,039 --> 00:32:09,919
go with it so

898
00:32:09,919 --> 00:32:12,159
even in a surveillance state even in

899
00:32:12,159 --> 00:32:15,519
a country where it's it's very difficult

900
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:16,240
to

901
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:18,240
feel open and honest about ethical

902
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:20,799
hacking and whatnot um there are still a

903
00:32:20,799 --> 00:32:22,320
number of certifications that can help

904
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:24,559
you on this path and a number of reasons

905
00:32:24,559 --> 00:32:26,480
why you should try to identify whether

906
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:29,279
you would make a qualified information

907
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:30,960
security expert ethical hacker

908
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:32,960
investigator or otherwise

909
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:34,880
and i picked this picture of elon musk

910
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:36,880
because he's often cited as one of the

911
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:39,360
most creative leaders

912
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:41,120
in the space

913
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:42,399
but essentially

914
00:32:42,399 --> 00:32:45,360
the term hacker has been thrown around

915
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:47,679
in pop culture and and around for a very

916
00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:50,559
long time um but it really to me means

917
00:32:50,559 --> 00:32:52,720
someone who is creative patient and has

918
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:56,559
humility in order to uh pursue some of

919
00:32:56,559 --> 00:32:59,679
these security problems to their end

920
00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:02,159
and i think that talent far outweighs

921
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:04,240
and outpaces anything else that you

922
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:06,000
might need

923
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,600
and i like to say and i think i've heard

924
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:09,679
this from a fellow member of the review

925
00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:11,600
board that defense is cool but offense

926
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:13,519
is cooler

927
00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:16,159
so again to mitigate that fear of

928
00:33:16,159 --> 00:33:17,760
prestige

929
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:19,919
we'll now talk about how much these bug

930
00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:21,919
bounty programs can pay

931
00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:24,320
and this is a very short bullet point

932
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:26,080
but i know that some people think that

933
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:28,240
this is kind of an offshoot industry

934
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:31,519
that it's not as attractive as others um

935
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:32,960
some students have said oh well i could

936
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:34,960
work at a bank or an insurance

937
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:38,000
but if paypal is paying out nearly 2.8

938
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,519
million dollars

939
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:42,720
verizon has now paid out over 9.5

940
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:45,120
the average payout for a bug bounty is

941
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:49,120
about 3 650 u.s dollars

942
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:50,799
which if you multiply that say you were

943
00:33:50,799 --> 00:33:53,360
to do this every month for a year you

944
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:54,799
have a very

945
00:33:54,799 --> 00:33:57,360
you have a generous base salary um you

946
00:33:57,360 --> 00:34:00,320
know if you were to continue also

947
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:02,159
with ethical hacking work as your day

948
00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:04,159
job and then pursue this at night then

949
00:34:04,159 --> 00:34:06,640
you're looking at

950
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:08,719
you know a decent salary that is

951
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:12,239
competitive with anyone in insurance or

952
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:15,119
financial analysis and i found that each

953
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:17,520
of those fields make about half of this

954
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:19,280
a year starting out so again it's a

955
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:20,719
field that you can really climb and

956
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:22,239
become prestigious in a very short

957
00:34:22,239 --> 00:34:24,480
period of time so again this is a reason

958
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:26,079
that i don't think people should shy

959
00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:28,399
away from pursuing cyber security or

960
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:29,760
ethical hacking i think it's something

961
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:31,520
that should actually encourage them to

962
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:34,719
pursue it and again to come back to that

963
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:36,560
skills gap there's just so much need

964
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:39,679
right now that it's it's important

965
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:41,839
so to wrap up with bright outcomes

966
00:34:41,839 --> 00:34:43,199
debunk the myth

967
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:44,960
offensive security engineers can work at

968
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:46,960
hundreds of companies and thrive um

969
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:48,960
every company is is hiring right now and

970
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:50,560
it's it's important to continue to

971
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:51,520
encourage

972
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:53,839
uh students to pursue this field it's

973
00:34:53,839 --> 00:34:55,440
safe when done right the careers are

974
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:56,800
well paid

975
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:59,040
and i'll say you know there are many

976
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:01,280
opportunities to pivot so any skills you

977
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:02,880
obtain in any field of information

978
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:04,880
security can always be applied to solve

979
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:06,240
other problems

980
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:08,160
um so there are a number of ways to

981
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:10,400
pivot within information security but

982
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:12,560
also once you get out you've been able

983
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:14,320
to identify

984
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:15,200
and

985
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:17,680
remediate problems right systemic

986
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:19,839
problems in the computer security of an

987
00:35:19,839 --> 00:35:22,160
organization uh that's an incredible

988
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:24,320
skill and it really

989
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:26,079
brings you up to the level of strategic

990
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:28,839
thinking that is admired at many

991
00:35:28,839 --> 00:35:30,640
companies

992
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:32,560
so call to action for the audience is i

993
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:34,400
just suggest you know identify

994
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:37,119
mentorship opportunities try to find

995
00:35:37,119 --> 00:35:39,200
those students in your neighborhood down

996
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:40,640
the block

997
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:42,000
or at your company that might be

998
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,079
interested in information security and

999
00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:45,920
encourage them to go try it because you

1000
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:47,680
know there they might just be held back

1001
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:49,440
for reasons that we've discussed in this

1002
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:51,599
presentation that aren't right and they

1003
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:53,119
might just not have enough information

1004
00:35:53,119 --> 00:35:54,640
to make that decision

1005
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:57,200
uh request a generous training budget as

1006
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:59,760
always um you know i know that i

1007
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:01,040
personally wouldn't have been able to

1008
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:03,359
take a lot of the classes i took or

1009
00:36:03,359 --> 00:36:04,800
pursue any of these certifications

1010
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:06,960
without the help of my

1011
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:09,119
wonderful mentors in the field

1012
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:11,760
my bosses and you know the budgets that

1013
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:13,359
allowed us to go get that training and

1014
00:36:13,359 --> 00:36:14,880
certification

1015
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:17,280
and then of course as a plug send your

1016
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:19,760
interns to black hat asia next year um

1017
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:21,440
you really are paying it forward by

1018
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:24,720
enabling the next generation of uh cyber

1019
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:27,440
