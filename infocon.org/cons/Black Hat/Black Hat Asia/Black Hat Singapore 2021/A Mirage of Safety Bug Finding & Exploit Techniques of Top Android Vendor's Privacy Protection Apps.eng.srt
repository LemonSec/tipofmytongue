00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:23,199
now

6
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:26,320
we will present your talk

7
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:28,720
a mirage of safety

8
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:32,399
backfinding and exploit techniques of

9
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:35,520
top android vendors privacy protection

10
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,840
apps

11
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:40,079
first

12
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:43,680
please allow me to introduce ourselves

13
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:46,559
we are from tencent company

14
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:48,640
and my department

15
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,879
tencent security xiang lab

16
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:53,760
is one tencent security research lab

17
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,079
based in beijing

18
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:58,800
we focus on the various applied and

19
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:02,079
real-world security research and report

20
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:04,479
hundreds of vulnerabilities to our

21
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:08,560
famous vendors every year

22
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,960
my colleague zhang qian focuses on

23
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:16,240
mobile security and found multiple

24
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:19,520
android kernel and system security

25
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:22,080
vulnerabilities

26
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:26,479
and i focus on mobile and iot security

27
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:29,920
and this is my third time here at

28
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:32,799
blackhead asia

29
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:37,119
this is the contents of our talk

30
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:39,520
first i will present you the

31
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:40,560
introduction

32
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:43,600
of the privacy protection apps and the

33
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:46,640
threat models about them

34
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:49,439
then my colleague will detail all the

35
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:50,960
vulnerabilities

36
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:53,040
and mitigations

37
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:57,439
and finally the conclusion

38
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:00,640
let's begin

39
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:03,680
we all want to keep our privacy and our

40
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:07,439
secrets hidden and safe

41
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:11,038
so nearly all top vendors develop and

42
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:16,000
provide us some privacy protection apps

43
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:20,400
such as secure folder

44
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,959
private space save

45
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:26,879
flag log etc

46
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:28,800
they can be characterized into three

47
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,319
types

48
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:31,760
type one

49
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:35,519
protecting the file access such as save

50
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:37,920
file save

51
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,360
type 2

52
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:43,200
protecting app usage such as app lock

53
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:46,000
and type 3

54
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:51,720
private isolated space such as qr folder

55
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:54,800
this slide shows some examples of the

56
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:59,280
three types of privacy protection apps

57
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:03,200
left picture shows file save

58
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:06,560
the user can store their file in it and

59
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:10,080
protect them by setting password and the

60
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:13,200
files will be encrypted

61
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:16,159
the middle picture shows a block

62
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:19,280
which can protect users apps from

63
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:22,800
unauthorized usage

64
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:25,920
the right picture shows private space

65
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:28,640
and the secure folder app which can

66
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:33,839
isolate multiple apps at the same time

67
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:38,640
we investigated the privacy protection

68
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:41,360
apps released by top file android

69
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:46,000
vendors and the result is shown here

70
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,879
all of them released at least one type

71
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:51,840
of privacy protection apps

72
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:52,879
and

73
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:56,560
two of them released all three types

74
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:57,680
of

75
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:00,720
privacy protecting apps

76
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,720
but the question is

77
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:06,640
is our privacy really safe

78
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:07,599
so

79
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:11,280
we begin our research

80
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:15,760
let's talk about the threat model

81
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:19,199
privacy protection apps protect files or

82
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:22,479
apps or space with the independent

83
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:25,120
password

84
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:28,960
or other authentication method so we

85
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:32,639
expect them to keep files or apps or

86
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:36,160
space save even after the attacker break

87
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:38,720
into the normal world

88
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,800
or log in the

89
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:44,240
normal android os

90
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:47,199
word privacy protect apps designed

91
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:48,720
protect

92
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,160
for file save

93
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,479
attackers can retrieve and decrypt a

94
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:56,240
file without valid authentication

95
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,560
for applock

96
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,880
attackers cannot use the app without

97
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:03,919
valid austin authentication

98
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:05,840
for private space

99
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:08,720
attackers cannot access or modify or

100
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:11,600
insert anything in it without valid

101
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,320
authentication

102
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:19,280
attack scenario is as follows

103
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,400
a1

104
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:23,360
attack from malicious apps

105
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,479
a2

106
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:27,360
attackers can attack from malicious apps

107
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:31,360
which can gain system privilege

108
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,639
e3

109
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:35,199
attackers have physically compromised

110
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:38,440
the phone

111
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:41,759
our expectation is attackers cannot get

112
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:47,280
anything when a1 or a2 or a3

113
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:50,639
if they cannot make our privacy safer

114
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:54,880
why the users bother to use them

115
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:58,560
so

116
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:01,280
this slide shows our expectation about

117
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:03,680
which attack scenario can compromise

118
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,199
them

119
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:07,759
or no

120
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:08,639
but

121
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:10,560
the fact is

122
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:14,400
all of them can be compromised

123
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,319
my colleague zhang jiang chen will

124
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:18,960
detail them

125
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,639
i will show the vulnerabilities examples

126
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:26,160
and the mitigations

127
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,560
there are many vulnerabilities and we

128
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:31,120
choose four of them to present to you

129
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,120
that this helps them they are typical

130
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:36,319
and good examples

131
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:38,000
when a databand

132
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,560
still data from the thief for malicious

133
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:41,680
apps

134
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,759
generally you can move the secret files

135
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:47,199
to save and set the password

136
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:51,199
app will encrypt the script files

137
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:53,120
then a title can't retrieve the file

138
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:56,160
without the password

139
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,880
but we found that the encryption here is

140
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,639
not safe at all

141
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:04,000
in this case the encrypted files are

142
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,160
stored in the sd card

143
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,759
the encryption

144
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:11,199
algorithm is a yes it has no padding

145
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:12,400
sounds good

146
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:15,120
but the key generation is not safe

147
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:20,000
the key is generated by the device id

148
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,880
this picture is again device id function

149
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:25,120
if the iphone

150
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,280
could get the i mean yet

151
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,759
the key will rely on package name and

152
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:32,160
the imei

153
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:35,680
if the f can't get to i'm yet

154
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:38,400
it will use the mac to generate a key if

155
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:42,800
the app can get an angle of me or mac

156
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,520
the app will use 10 dollars to generate

157
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:49,039
a case so it only relies on the package

158
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:49,919
name

159
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:52,160
ami yeah mecca which animal is

160
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:55,160
advocating

161
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:59,199
lessons are very simple vulnerability

162
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:00,160
but

163
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,639
the case is not our learn

164
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:03,680
this is

165
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,599
another example

166
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:07,199
the inclusion

167
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:10,639
algorithm is aes ecb no padding

168
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:12,639
the k generation is

169
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:13,599
such a

170
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:15,680
fixed string

171
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,440
we also found that

172
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:20,319
another thief is included by xor with

173
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:23,280
the single byte

174
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:27,840
with that of malicious f as a demo

175
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:32,080
first we get the encrypted file from the

176
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,240
sd card

177
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:38,399
and then decrease it let's see the

178
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:40,880
first difference we have nothing

179
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:43,360
first of all

180
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,880
we take some pictures

181
00:08:55,519 --> 00:09:00,120
then move it to the first safe

182
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:12,160
the malicious app can get all the data

183
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:15,040
from the fellowship

184
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,480
next up

185
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,560
vulnerability type 2

186
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,240
achieve the safety plan test the

187
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:30,560
password from the chassis zone

188
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,880
in our research we found that

189
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:36,080
some vendors use tesla to protect

190
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,279
the cells

191
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:39,440
we are happy to see this because the

192
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:42,320
chasm is capable to protect our

193
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,160
fibers by safe

194
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,600
if the vendors

195
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,560
store the key and the data in chat room

196
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:51,279
lately the hardware architecture will

197
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:53,360
guarantee their safety in the

198
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,839
introduction of the safe album instead

199
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:58,800
that the password is not stored and

200
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:02,359
can't be restored

201
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:07,600
our expectation is this

202
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,880
step 1

203
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,959
input password

204
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:13,680
step 2 the first if app sends the

205
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:17,200
password to t interface to check

206
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,519
step 3 the key interface sends the

207
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:22,399
password to check to charge the zone

208
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:24,880
therefore if the charging f is

209
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:27,440
responsible to check letter the password

210
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:31,360
is valued and return the result

211
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:34,079
step five if we check okay the t

212
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:35,920
interface will send

213
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:37,440
the messages

214
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,440
to the fellowship f

215
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,720
step six

216
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:41,600
the

217
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:44,240
file save app will use the input

218
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:46,160
password to decrease the file and the

219
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:49,279
display to user

220
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:54,320
step 7 the user gets the decrypted file

221
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,320
so the plain text

222
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:00,079
password never leaves the chapter 1.

223
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:03,680
however the fact is this

224
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:06,480
in step four three the t interface gets

225
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:10,560
the password from chapter zone

226
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:11,760
step four

227
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:14,240
the child f will return the plaintext

228
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:17,360
password to normal order

229
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:21,360
and then compare it to the password

230
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:24,399
with user input

231
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:29,040
if we check ok the user gets the

232
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:31,040
decrypted file

233
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:33,519
so the printer is the password leaves

234
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:35,680
the trusted word and they will not

235
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:38,399
receive anymore

236
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:40,720
then

237
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,279
the left picture

238
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:45,760
shows the function to extract the

239
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,440
password from

240
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,720
class zone

241
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,560
the function's input

242
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:53,040
is the boxer for the name which is the

243
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:55,680
celsius for the name and the return

244
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:58,959
value is the plaintext password

245
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:01,360
the last picture shows our explorer

246
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:04,240
output we can see that we can get all

247
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:07,519
the first sixth plain text password from

248
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:10,079
the phone

249
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:11,040
let's

250
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:14,240
move on to vulnerability three

251
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:17,680
bypass the privacy password we found

252
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:18,560
that

253
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:21,440
almost all privacy apps can be unlocked

254
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:24,560
by fingerprinter as shown in this slider

255
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:27,279
after the privacy apps rather to check

256
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:30,639
the fingerprint is no added or not

257
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:33,279
so the attacker can add a new

258
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:36,639
fingerprint to bypass the authentication

259
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:39,360
and also we can reset the password with

260
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,800
the sms

261
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:45,120
verification code on some vendors form

262
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:50,200
this is a demo

263
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:56,079
first let's see the private safe and the

264
00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:57,200
f-lock

265
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:00,680
we can enter

266
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:18,360
next we have to add a new fingerprint

267
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:27,839
now we can use the new fingerprint to

268
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:32,920
enter the private safe and app lock

269
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,120
finally let's talk about the last type

270
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,800
of private safe

271
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:46,079
parameter space f

272
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:49,040
in the introduction the window side the

273
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:51,760
users can create a secure space on your

274
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:54,560
device to include and store your private

275
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:57,040
data and apps

276
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:59,360
apps and data in secure photos are

277
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:01,680
sandboxed separately on the device and

278
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:04,240
get an additional layer of security and

279
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:06,880
the privacy that further protecting them

280
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:10,320
from malicious attacks

281
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:14,720
the secure folder seemed very safe so we

282
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:18,480
were curious about its implementation we

283
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:21,199
first engineered the app and we found

284
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:23,680
intercom android the user manager

285
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:26,639
multi-user api to create another user

286
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:29,519
this is the output of atp shell command

287
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:31,600
pianist users

288
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,680
it will confirm the orchestra and when

289
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:36,720
we activate the secure photo another

290
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:39,519
unit in the secure folder will be added

291
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:42,839
in the system

292
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:48,320
also android mac user android

293
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,959
supports a multiple user on a single

294
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:53,920
android device by separating user

295
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:55,279
accounts and

296
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:57,600
application data

297
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,839
for instance parents may allow their

298
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:02,560
children to use the family tablet a

299
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:05,440
family can share an automobile

300
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:07,279
or a critical

301
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:09,519
response team night show or mobile

302
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:12,160
device for alcohol

303
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:15,360
there are three types of users

304
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,040
the primary

305
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:20,079
user is the first user added to the 12

306
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:21,360
device

307
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:24,560
and is the administer and has special

308
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,720
privileges and the settings only is

309
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:28,160
concerned

310
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,880
and it can impact other users the

311
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:33,600
secondary users and the guest user

312
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:37,519
cannot impact other users

313
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:41,360
the united datum are stolen separately

314
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:44,320
on the device here is this person

315
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,839
and there are some

316
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:48,079
commands too fast

317
00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:51,040
to manage other users and the primary

318
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:53,279
users for example

319
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:54,480
am

320
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,959
adb install and so on and we can use

321
00:15:56,959 --> 00:15:59,519
container provider to read or write

322
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:02,160
other user data

323
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:04,240
our expectation is

324
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:05,920
pm or am

325
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:09,040
and content multi-user command will be

326
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:11,600
patched this command will be on the

327
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:14,880
blacklist so the primary user can't

328
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:18,880
install our control apps or access data

329
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,880
in secure folder

330
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:23,759
however the fact is they are not patched

331
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:26,720
the primary user can install

332
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:29,920
and control user install apps and access

333
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:31,920
any detail

334
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:32,639
so

335
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:34,880
we can break the private space by this

336
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:37,920
command easily for example we can

337
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:40,320
install malicious apps by using adb

338
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,600
install command

339
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:45,600
slider and any f by m starter

340
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:48,639
and we can go enter automations for any

341
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:52,959
f using adb shell pm grant

342
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:56,000
and still data from secure folder by

343
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,839
content writer and reader command

344
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:04,120
this is a demo

345
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:13,240
first let's see the secure folder

346
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:20,000
that is done

347
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,039
official whatsapp

348
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:29,079
it doesn't have any permissions

349
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:45,760
after being activated the secure folder

350
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:50,000
we need to enter password to enter game

351
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,799
now the tackle then and explore

352
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:55,879
a scripture

353
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:10,600
so

354
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:18,640
then the official app has been replaced

355
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:21,600
with the malicious app in the secure

356
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,960
folder

357
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:26,919
and it has all permissions

358
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:39,440
then we will show how to steal files in

359
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:43,720
one more secure folder

360
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:54,640
first let the user take a photo in the

361
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:57,840
secure folder

362
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:27,919
then the attacker can

363
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:29,039
steal

364
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:33,440
the pictures from the secure folder

365
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:40,160
this is a common vulnerability

366
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:42,160
all the private spaces based on

367
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:46,480
multi-user can be exploited

368
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:48,960
finally

369
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:51,360
the advice and mitigation

370
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:52,559
for development

371
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:55,520
use the trust zone properly

372
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:58,880
sd card is not safe at all don't use it

373
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,559
when you are very careful about your

374
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:04,720
privacy don't use any mac as a key

375
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:07,520
to generate a key your android id will

376
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:10,640
be better android id virus for different

377
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,320
apps

378
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:14,400
prevent local attacks

379
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,720
for users don't rely

380
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:20,000
on privacy protection apps

381
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,159
and keep good security habits in the

382
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:24,799
more useful

383
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:29,120
nearly our windows

384
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:31,840
developer and provide us with some

385
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:33,840
privacy protection apps

386
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:36,960
such as secure photo predator

387
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:40,159
space safe as local and so on they claim

388
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:42,640
that receiving private cells in this

389
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,559
action will be safe

390
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:47,120
however we conducted a comprehensive

391
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:50,159
research about them and found that it's

392
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:53,039
not true for most of them

393
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:56,400
many design and our development flows a

394
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:59,360
lot of text to bypass them protection

395
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:00,640
and

396
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:02,960
access the previous

397
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:05,919
files inside them which will affect the

398
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:09,200
opinions of users

399
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:11,600
we presented the four types of

400
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,760
vulnerabilities and advices for

401
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:16,559
developers and users i share our

402
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:18,000
research

403
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,559
we want to improve the security of the

404
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:23,440
privacy protection apps and better

405
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:25,919
protect users

406
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:28,400
privacy

407
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,679
our

408
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:31,600
are reported to

409
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:34,640
vendors in april 2020 and most of them

410
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:36,720
are fixed

411
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:40,280
thank you for listening
