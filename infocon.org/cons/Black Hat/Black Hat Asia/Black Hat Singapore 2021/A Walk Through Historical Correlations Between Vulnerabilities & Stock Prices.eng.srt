00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,279
hi guys good morning i'm alejandro

3
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:20,560
hernandez

4
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:21,439
from

5
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:24,240
ioactive and today we will go through

6
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:26,480
historical correlations between security

7
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:29,679
issues versus stock prices

8
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:32,800
about me i'm from chiapas mexico

9
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:35,040
i didn't work for ioaktive

10
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:37,360
i also like a bit of economics and

11
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:40,800
finance and recently i have

12
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,680
reached both topics with cybersecurity

13
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:47,120
in 2018 i presented at blackhat usa

14
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:49,120
my research on scripted problems on

15
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:51,120
trading technologies

16
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:54,239
but today i won't talk about technical

17
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:55,120
stuff

18
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:57,680
instead we'll go through

19
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:00,160
a security problems and how do they

20
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,800
affect the stock prices of companies

21
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,159
will go through vulnerabilities

22
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:07,280
incidents sabotage and espionage issues

23
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:10,799
privacy and other interesting factors

24
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:14,640
in the end we'll have some conclusions

25
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:17,360
first let's start with the butterfly

26
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:19,520
effect from the chaos theory

27
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:21,280
it's well known that the flutter of a

28
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:23,920
butterfly's wing can

29
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:25,439
cause a typhoon

30
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:27,439
on the other side of the world

31
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:30,880
this concept could be taken

32
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:35,600
in into the supply chain for instance

33
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:38,640
what do avocados the nfl

34
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:42,399
and the monarch butterflies of mexico

35
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:44,079
have in common

36
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:46,320
well

37
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,240
the super bowl is one of the most

38
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,560
broadcast events and

39
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:53,280
people demand tons of avocado but

40
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,600
particularly from a specific part of

41
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,759
mexico in the central lands

42
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:01,119
so the people and even drug cartels

43
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:02,960
realize they can make a lot of money

44
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:06,079
with avocado so if they start to devour

45
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:09,199
the forests or these four flies live

46
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:12,640
also the government have found

47
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:16,800
many dead people particularly activists

48
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,800
activists that defend

49
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,680
the butterflies ecosystem

50
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,599
this could be taken to the supply chain

51
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:24,800
right

52
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,720
all the companies are connected to

53
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:30,000
create final consumer products

54
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,400
if there is a disruption in the chain

55
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,400
this will be

56
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,519
this will affect the next companies

57
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:38,640
there are

58
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:41,040
many public companies

59
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,680
scattered in this nation

60
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:44,560
now

61
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,959
what affects these stock prices there

62
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:48,959
are many

63
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:50,400
things that could affect

64
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,400
the prices such as economic factors

65
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,560
political demographics

66
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:58,319
uh natural forces and cyber security

67
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:01,040
related problems which is the topic of

68
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,080
today

69
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,080
now

70
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,920
first of all

71
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:08,400
this is a disclaimer

72
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,480
to let you know that attribution to

73
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:13,280
security incidents versus stock prices

74
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:16,800
is not easy for instance the same day a

75
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,519
security problem is

76
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:21,040
reported

77
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,640
were made public

78
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:24,799
the same day could be

79
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:27,200
economic problems in a country or could

80
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,920
be political problems and all the stock

81
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:33,360
indexes would fall and will

82
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,599
drop the entire market so it's it's hard

83
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:36,400
to

84
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,239
answer your particular security

85
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:40,000
incidents to

86
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,599
the price right

87
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:44,000
and the second thing is this research

88
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,159
wasn't really based on technicals which

89
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:47,920
are shorter

90
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:50,720
in order to see the real impact of a

91
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,400
security problem

92
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,879
we must go to fundamentals which are

93
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:57,040
myth to long-term because

94
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,959
losses are quantified into quarterly or

95
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:02,879
annual reports and there are you know

96
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:05,280
costs of fixing the problems incidence

97
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,480
response recovery disruptions in

98
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:09,599
operations

99
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:13,599
regulatory fines insurance and etc

100
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:14,879
now

101
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:18,399
let's start with one abilities

102
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:20,560
you probably remember

103
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:23,360
the meltdown and factory bug in the

104
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:26,720
microprocessors in intel for instance so

105
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:30,680
by january 2018

106
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:33,840
these bugs were reported

107
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,639
the stock price dropped minus 3.3

108
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:38,080
percent

109
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:38,820
however

110
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:40,240
[Music]

111
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,720
the selloff continued for the second day

112
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:45,040
because of the impact of the finding as

113
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,120
you can see here

114
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,280
but

115
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:52,800
two weeks later on january 25th

116
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:53,840
intel

117
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,680
reported earnings

118
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,759
and they beat the expectations so

119
00:04:57,759 --> 00:04:59,680
basically wall street

120
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:02,160
entirely forgot about the

121
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,840
vulnerabilities

122
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:07,039
and the stock price continued to go up

123
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:09,440
and up

124
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:10,479
now

125
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:12,960
soon in the communications uh probably

126
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,479
you remember a vulnerability that

127
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:15,360
allowed

128
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,880
people to

129
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:20,160
um to join calls

130
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,800
since it wasn't the pandemic

131
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,560
again wall street and other people

132
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,000
didn't care about

133
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,360
the impact of these security

134
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,720
vulnerabilities as you can see in the

135
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:29,520
graph

136
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,919
there is a small red candle here but

137
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:32,880
the

138
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:35,199
price skyrocketed

139
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:37,440
because

140
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,759
also it's important to see

141
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:43,120
that whenever this impact

142
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,560
differently

143
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,720
according to the sector on the industry

144
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:49,680
is not the same vulnerability in a

145
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:52,479
software product than in a car in the

146
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:54,080
autopilot

147
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,039
software

148
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:57,039
which is

149
00:05:57,039 --> 00:06:00,000
that happened in tesla

150
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,560
basically

151
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,280
the price dropped more than 100

152
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,280
dollars in two days

153
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:09,360
which is a lot

154
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:13,360
you can see this red candle minus 6.88

155
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,039
because of the

156
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:18,840
flow in the autopilot autopilot

157
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,479
software

158
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:21,680
now

159
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:24,240
when it comes to incidents

160
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,360
let's see

161
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:28,080
the taiwan semiconductor

162
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,479
drop basically there is a

163
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:34,560
virus outbreak that hit their factories

164
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,440
and

165
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:38,560
it was by friday but by sunday eighty

166
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:41,680
percent of the equipment bus was back in

167
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,680
line

168
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,340
as i said below before

169
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:47,039
[Music]

170
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:48,130
the fundamentals

171
00:06:48,130 --> 00:06:50,960
[Music]

172
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,800
reflect the real impacts of these

173
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,520
problems such as this one

174
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,919
this problem will affect the revenue by

175
00:06:57,919 --> 00:06:58,800
3

176
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,360
and the shipments will be delayed but in

177
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,199
the short term

178
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:05,759
we'll see by monday a small drop of

179
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:09,039
minus 1.49 but still

180
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:12,880
the price went up

181
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:16,319
the infamous equifax equifac

182
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:19,039
equifax bridge

183
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:21,280
basically the stock falling

184
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:24,960
more than 38

185
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,720
to the lowest levels

186
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:29,680
after the bridge many people

187
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,440
we thought that the company would never

188
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,680
recover or it would take years to

189
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:36,080
recover

190
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,840
you can see this

191
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,599
massive sell-off

192
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:41,360
minus 38

193
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,840
to the lowest level

194
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:45,919
here nonetheless

195
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:47,120
two years

196
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,479
after

197
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:50,879
the company was back

198
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:54,639
to the price levels prior the bridge and

199
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:56,560
continue to go up

200
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,479
so it's it's interesting to see

201
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:01,199
how companies recover of these massive

202
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:02,960
bridges

203
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,879
the home depot

204
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:08,000
uh case will see

205
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,599
that this this was

206
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:13,360
pre-order 2015 and it's important to say

207
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,520
that because later i will explain

208
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:16,319
some

209
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:20,720
insights i i i saw basically 56 million

210
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,639
cards were compromised

211
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:24,720
in this bridge

212
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,319
nevertheless

213
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:29,360
the price went up and up and up

214
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,759
wall street didn't occur

215
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:34,159
and same

216
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:35,360
[Music]

217
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:38,159
as you can see here the investor

218
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:40,880
didn't care about

219
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,240
the millions of

220
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,080
of

221
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,080
registers stolen

222
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,200
because

223
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:50,080
these companies this this sector was

224
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:52,839
had the help of the affordable care act

225
00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:54,640
basically

226
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,959
wall street didn't care about again

227
00:08:56,959 --> 00:08:59,360
in these breaches

228
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,680
most recently

229
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:02,000
[Music]

230
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,880
um for instance a garmin

231
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,800
last year

232
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,720
apparently they paid

233
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,880
a multi-million dollars

234
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,240
to

235
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,880
the attackers

236
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:17,440
because they injected ransomware

237
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,600
also they had their services offline for

238
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,600
several days there were many people on

239
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,160
twitter on social media reporting the

240
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:26,959
having problems with their watches

241
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:28,000
and

242
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,040
we can see a minus 3.45

243
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:34,640
but as you can see again

244
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:37,120
this stock went up

245
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,959
the next month

246
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:42,560
but it recovered quickly in five days

247
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,959
you can see this candle here

248
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:49,360
the price was above the original levels

249
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:52,160
the firelight case

250
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:54,240
you are very aware of this this is

251
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,480
a fresh card this was the first company

252
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:59,279
who realized there was a national state

253
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:01,440
hack

254
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,440
and the company

255
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,399
dropped

256
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:06,079
minus 13

257
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:07,519
that day

258
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:08,480
then

259
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:13,360
you will see this massive green candle

260
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,480
next week

261
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,920
and i will

262
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:18,399
tell you why

263
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:21,440
firefight reported that it was not their

264
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:24,720
fault it was something bigger

265
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:27,279
and something bigger is the solar winds

266
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:28,079
act

267
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:31,680
that affected many companies when solar

268
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:34,320
reported it was their fault

269
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:37,360
a backdoor in her in their software

270
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,320
many

271
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,720
cyber security companies

272
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,560
the names like firearm

273
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:45,839

00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:48,880
art the entire industry the entire

275

uh

276
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:51,040
sector

277
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:54,160
was up because many companies were about

278
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:58,240
to invest more in cybersecurity

279
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,640
we're about to buy more products hence

280
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:04,000
the price skyrocketed including fire eye

281
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,920
as you can see here

282
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:07,330
it went to the sky

283
00:11:07,330 --> 00:11:09,040
[Music]

284
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:12,320
now if we speak about escanage

285
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,640
or things related to the national state

286
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,720
security we will see the case of

287
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:19,440
solarwinds

288
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:22,800
the company

289
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,000
fell

290
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,040
minus

291
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,640
40

292
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,560
almost minus 40

293
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,720
in that week

294
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:34,800
that was a massive drop

295
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:35,839
however

296
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:40,000
uh as of march 26th we have

297
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
an almost 19

298
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,440
recovery from

299
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,920
its december lows

300
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:48,320
the company is recovering

301
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:51,040
how much time it will take we don't know

302
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:53,519
probably it can take one year or two

303
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:57,440
years as equifax we don't know yet

304
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,760
another example here the super

305
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,040
microcomputer

306
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:01,920
inc

307
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,920
they remember probably

308
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:04,880
the

309
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:07,200
legacy chips

310
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,399
with

311
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:10,560
the spine chips

312
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:11,680
well

313
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:16,079
that day the company dropped minus 41

314
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:18,320
after the company released a press

315
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,560
release saying it was

316
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:24,000
false etc and you can see the price many

317
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,680
people made a lot of money here with

318
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:26,480
this

319
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,720
massive recovery but that day

320
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,320
minus 41

321
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,800
that's a lot

322
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,000
um

323
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,600
the saudi aramco attack with bronze

324
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,600
the company was not public yet but

325
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:42,079
impacted in the ipo for instance they

326
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:42,959
have

327
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:45,440
to delay the ipo

328
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:47,600
when it comes to privacy

329
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,079
the best case is facebook

330
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:53,360
there are multiple cases

331
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,200
this was in

332
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:58,079
early 2018

333
00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:01,600
with the cambridge analytica

334
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,440
scandal

335
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,040
we see

336
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:07,440
minus 17

337
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,920
or something like that in the next days

338
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:12,160
but again you see this

339
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:13,279
see how

340
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:15,440
quickly they recovered in the next

341
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,760
months

342
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,120
in december that year

343
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,760
a few months after again there was

344
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,600
another privacy program

345
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,519
with facebook

346
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:30,800
the company that they lost minus seven

347
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:33,440
point twenty five percent of market cap

348
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:38,160
but again see this b-shape recovery

349
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:42,639
and this part is just

350
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:44,800
about misleading information how people

351
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:47,279
trust on social media

352
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:49,760
or they get confused it's not strictly

353
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:52,160
related to cyber security but i think

354
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:52,880
it's

355
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:56,480
something important and funny to say

356
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:59,760
in this case cisco was not buying fire

357
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:02,320
contrary to the rumors

358
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,399
fire i went up

359
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:08,160
almost 4.57

360
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,079
but after cisco said it was not buying

361
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:13,040
it it dropped

362
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:16,720
the ptp case you know pdp the encryption

363
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,800
software well they have a critical flaw

364
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,480
in 2018

365
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:22,959
and the problem here is that many people

366
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:26,079
start using the dollar sign on twitter

367
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:27,199
and

368
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:29,440
another social media automatically

369
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:33,120
people got confused but the pgp ticker

370
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,800
doesn't have

371
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:37,120
uh do anything with the

372
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,880
encryption software instead it's a

373
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,959
different company called

374
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:42,560
something

375
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:44,720
the stock price dropped the people

376
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:47,360
realized and went up again a few minutes

377
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,680
after

378
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:52,959
soon with double o versus zoom zm

379
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:54,639
without oz

380
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:57,440
some technologies is that it was

381
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:00,000
a tiny company from india

382
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,199
penny stock

383
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:02,959
and zoom is the software we use for

384
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:04,720
video communications right

385
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:07,120
prior the ipo

386
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,399
people

387
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:09,600
went

388
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,040
and bought

389
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:13,040
the other stock

390
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,320
and

391
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,560
the stock was 56

392
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,000
000

393
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,720
in one month

394
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:23,440
one day people realized it was the wrong

395
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,519
stock and

396
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:26,720
the price

397
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:29,120
tanked

398
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:32,079
last year amidst the pandemics

399
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:34,560
with the chronic virus crisis and the

400
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,160
zoom mania

401
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:37,680
this is something

402
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:39,040
people call

403
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:42,639
a financial like this lecture

404
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:44,880
people get confused

405
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:47,600
with this mania

406
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,920
sent stock price again of the wrong

407
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:52,000
company to the sky the day after they

408
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,720
realized and they dumped the stock

409
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,480
many people

410
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:59,040
lost a lot of money but many other

411
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:01,120
made a lot of money here

412
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:04,160
now let's answer some questions

413
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:06,399
do issues

414
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:08,240
in subsidiaries

415
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:10,800
impact to the foreign companies let's

416
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,880
see the verizon case

417
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:15,839
basically they agreed to purchase yahoo

418
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:18,020
in july 2016

419
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:19,680
[Music]

420
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:23,040
however they bought it until june then

421
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:25,040
the next year however

422
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:28,160
in between on december 2016 there was a

423
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:29,839
data breach in yahoo

424
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:32,720
and you can see a red candle here in

425
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:35,199
verizon's stock price

426
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:37,600
so yes

427
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:38,639
there are

428
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:40,959
there is there are impact in current

429
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:42,240
companies

430
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:45,920
what's up a critical point

431
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:48,160
reported

432
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:51,240
and we can see minus

433
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:52,959
3.61

434
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:56,399
drop that day on facebook price

435
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:58,240
so yes

436
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:59,120
the

437
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,120
impact also affects

438
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,680
the owners of the companies or the

439
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:06,640
mergers and acquisitions

440
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:10,400
the the price affect both

441
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,880
now in the supply chain do issues impact

442
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:13,780
other companies

443
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:15,760
[Music]

444
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:18,400
let's see again the case of the taiwan's

445
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,400
semiconductor which is one of the

446
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:23,439
biggest manufacturers of chips in the

447
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:24,319
world

448
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:27,119
they supply components to amd apple

449
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:30,480
media et cetera so when

450
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:32,160
when the virus outbreak on their

451
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,600
factories

452
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,120
we'll see this

453
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:37,840
small red candle that day

454
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:40,000
well i as first i remember it was

455
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,520
monday

456
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,600
this is apple

457
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:46,320
you will see the uptrend here however

458
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:48,240
there is a red candle here

459
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,679
amd

460
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:51,919
you will see the uptrend however there

461
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:54,080
is a small candle here probably it's a

462
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:55,679
coincidence

463
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:57,200
or not but

464
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,440
by common sense

465
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:01,760
the news

466
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:06,480
were mentioning apple amd that day

467
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:07,679
now

468
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:09,840
this is the most important part of the

469
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:10,799
talk

470
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:14,000
impacts per issue type per term and per

471
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,039
sector

472
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:17,280
take a look at this

473
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:18,799
at the next slide

474
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:21,520
with this we will answer some questions

475
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:23,360
such as

476
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:25,840
are severe time security issues

477
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:28,480
like vulnerabilities or data reaches

478
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,080
more impactful

479
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:32,160
are some sectors more affected

480
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:34,559
and do companies recover

481
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:38,918
and how quickly they do it

482
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:45,600
the white cells are vulnerabilities

483
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,760
the others incidents

484
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,679
we have the company names the sectors

485
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:53,039
industry the details the date

486
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:55,360
and in the last column we have the

487
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:56,960
number of days

488
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:00,000
they recovered which is how many days

489
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,160
has passed

490
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,600
after the

491
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,039
the price

492
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:06,320
go back

493
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:07,520
prior the

494
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:10,880
vulnerability or the incident reported

495
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:12,640
right

496
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:15,520
so as you can see

497
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:18,160
the changes on the price

498
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,679
many of them

499
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:20,400
are

500
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,760
small

501
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:25,840
less than four or five percent

502
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:27,360
four of them

503
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:30,080
are even positive that means that

504
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,600
wall street didn't care about the

505
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,919
vulnerability reported right

506
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:35,039
and those

507
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:38,480
who were affected they recovered

508
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:41,440
most of them in less than one month in

509
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:45,520
days in a couple of days or in 10 days

510
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:48,960
unlike the incidents for instance

511
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:51,520
these two in the health

512
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:54,000
care sector

513
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,200
they had a ransomware attack

514
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,280
they had they recovered

515
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:00,540
in less than one year

516
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:02,159
[Music]

517
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:03,200
however

518
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:06,320
this other slide full of incidents data

519
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:07,360
breaches

520
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:10,559
on different sectors you will see

521
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:11,600
drops

522
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,679
in the price

523
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:14,799
nonetheless

524
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:17,919
they record in less than one month as

525
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:20,799
you can see here the dates in a couple

526
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:24,639
of weeks in two or three days

527
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:29,120
now as i said before

528
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:31,760
things related to sabotage espionage

529
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:32,799
are

530
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:34,480
more impacted

531
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,000
as you can see

532
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,799
here in the stock prices

533
00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:40,799
minus 41

534
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:43,520
in the case of super micro

535
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:44,640
computer

536
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:47,679
or minus minus almost 40 percent in the

537
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:49,919
recent solar winds hack

538
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:52,880
when it comes to privacy

539
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:56,320
you will see also bleed drops minus 17

540
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:58,240
minus 13

541
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:59,919
and the recoveries

542
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:02,960
they depend of course on the impact

543
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:07,200
of of the hack or the problem

544
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,760
we still don't know when solar winds

545
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:11,280
will recover

546
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:14,000
probably in less than one year

547
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,159
it looks like less than one euro

548
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:18,320
if you see the graph i shown below

549
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:19,440
before

550
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:21,520
and

551
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:24,080
the the recovery of solar winds is like

552
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:27,840
30 percent now from its lowest levels if

553
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:30,720
you see the gap

554
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,480
now

555
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:35,039
the impacts the key points

556
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:36,880
vulnerabilities

557
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:40,880
they do not impact as bad as we thought

558
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,880
they have no impact less than four

559
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:45,440
percent drop and they recover quickly

560
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:46,960
less than one month

561
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:49,280
forty percent of my observations they

562
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:51,039
didn't impact negatively in the stock

563
00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:55,200
price instead they went up and up

564
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:57,600
unlike the incidents they are more

565
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:00,480
impactful than vulnerabilities more than

566
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:02,880
five percent in average

567
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,480
and the recovery of course depends on

568
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:06,720
the amount and the sensitive of the data

569
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:08,400
leaked

570
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,080

571
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:12,880
of my observations my cases recorded in

572
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:15,679
less than one month even with when car

and

575
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:20,720
personal information was leaked

576
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:21,600

580
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:32,559
the spy ships

581
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:36,159
we will see bigger impacts 15 drop

00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:38,159
or above

583
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:38,960
now

584
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:41,520
data breaches the finance sector is the

585
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:43,039
most impacted

586
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:45,200
particularly the ones related with

587
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:48,240
payment processing or credit or and

588
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:50,640
debit cards

589
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:53,039
and also the healthcare

590
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:56,480
sector is the least impacted so

591
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:58,320
what

592
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:02,799
does it tell us basically um investors

593
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:04,720
traders wall street care more about

594
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:07,910

overall in general

597
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:14,480
of all my observations 50

598
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:16,880
of them record in less than one month

599
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:19,440
most companies record in less than

600
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,880
than one year

601
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,559
and the ones that

602
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:24,080
recovered

603
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:27,120
in more than one year were equifax and

depot

608
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:37,360
which was in 2014

609
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:40,559
well all the older data breaches before

610
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:44,080
2015 didn't have a sharp price drop

611
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:46,400
and they record in less than one week

616
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:55,600
why is that

617
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,919
in my opinion i think it's because

618
00:23:57,919 --> 00:24:00,080
before 2015

619
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:02,480
cyber security

620
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:06,799
or data breaches etc were not

621
00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:09,039
too mainstream as

622
00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:11,600
those topics are today

623
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:14,799
now more nowadays investors and people

624
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:18,159
are more concerned on their security of

625
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:20,240
their credit cards or their personal

626
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:22,080
data or their health

627
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:23,360
data

628
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:25,039
that's just

629
00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:27,760
my my conclusion right

630
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:28,960
now

631
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:33,840
who makes money profit and losses

632
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:36,080
one of the cases are short sellers for

633

instance

634
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:39,600
this case is interesting

the firm movie waters

636
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:43,120
which is

637
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:44,000
a

638
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,720
short center company

639
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:48,880
they reported

640
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:50,720
basically they released

641
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:53,279
a report with security vulnerabilities

00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:54,470

645
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,200
but they did it in a very irresponsible

646
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,080
way

647
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:05,200
this is what many short sellers they

648
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:07,360
basically release the report to the

649
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:09,679
internet without

650
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:12,240
letting the the companies know about it

651
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:14,880
so they have a short position and they

652
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:17,200
make money if the stock price

653
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:19,760
drops

654
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:22,880
also inside of traders which is super

655
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:25,679
illegal of course like

656
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:29,039
in the equifax case some traders knew

657
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:31,600
about the problem and they

658
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:34,000
sold their stocks

659
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,520
prior it was

660
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:37,360
made public right

661
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:38,480
probably

662
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:40,240
they are going to jail

663
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,679
i don't know

664
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:42,799
people

665
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:45,200
like us retail traders

666
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:49,440
we can buy the effing tip

667
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:51,200
the other day with the garmin

668
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,960
vulnerability for instance i saw the

669
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:55,760
drop i was doing the research already

670
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:58,080
and i thought all right according to my

671
00:25:58,080 --> 00:25:59,279
observation

672
00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:00,960
this couldn't

673
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,960
be dropped below six percent for

674
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:05,600
instance so i bought at minus

675
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:10,080
4.5 or something and the price rebounded

676
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:12,880
so i made some profit with it

677
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:15,520
i have made some other trades

678
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:19,279
using these statistical analysis and

679
00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:21,919
most of them work for instance in the

680
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:24,640
case of solarwinds or in the case of

681
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:28,000
fire eye i bought both of them

682
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,159
and initially i was losing some money

683
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:33,039
but in the end i just waited i converted

684
00:26:33,039 --> 00:26:36,320
them into swing trades

685
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:38,559
for instance the solar winds had i

686
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:39,919
waited for

687
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:41,360
a

688
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:43,919
two months now but i already have

689
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:47,919
positive profit in the recovery

690
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:48,960
who

691
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,720
loses money companies of course with

692
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:52,880
their market capitalization

693
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,480
they also

694
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:56,960
lose reputation reputation the social

695
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:59,520
sentiment of the people right

696
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:00,480
and

697
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,080
people

698
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:04,559
our pockets are affected we also

699
00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:06,880
fall into morning market calls with our

700
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:09,360
brokers

701
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:10,880
and

which are recommendations

706
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:20,720
against what we've seen before

707
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:22,960
on how you can assess your supply chain

708
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,159
to enhance

709

713
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:35,919
for the investor

00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:38,000
stay alive with the price price changes

715
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,520
of your companies

716
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:41,919
stay updated with the news either in

717
00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:42,799
your

718
00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:46,320
in a sector in your country or

719
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:48,640
worldwide news

720
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:52,000
and also set stop-loss orders

721
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,600
in case of

722
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:54,880
you know

723
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:56,960
surprises

724
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:59,279
conclusions

725
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:00,559
in general

726
00:28:00,559 --> 00:28:02,399
security issues

727
00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:06,080
impact negatively in stock prices

728
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:08,880
we've seen that but they recover

729
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:11,679
quickly in less than one month

730
00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:13,440
in less than one year

731
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,320
and

732
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:16,880
this was our first approach

733
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:18,399
we need more data

734
00:28:18,399 --> 00:28:20,480
to get more accurate results and

735
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:21,919
remember

736
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:25,200
this was entirely based on technicals

737
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:27,600
not fundamentals probably this would be

738
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:30,880
another interesting topic to discuss

739
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:32,960
in further research

740
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:34,000
and

741
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,320
