and i am responsible for improving

38
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:45,920
automated threat hunting

39
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:48,560
this is the agenda for today

40
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,960
at the very first place of course we are

41
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:53,920
going to clarify what the the character

42
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:56,719
or main character claude dragon is

43
00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:59,840
to like give a whole picture of the

44
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,520
cloud dragon we are talking about and

45
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,119
its profile

46
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:06,000
and the part that will account for most

47
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,199
of the the speech is the techniques that

48
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:11,599
they have been applied in their past

49
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:12,720
attacks

50
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,680
also we will include several of our new

51
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:19,360
observations on their attacks uh in

52
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,440
recent recently

53
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,520
at the very last part

54
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,480
uh we will go back to the topic

55
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:29,440
of how the nightmare become a reality so

56
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:32,160
we will talk about our observation on

57
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:37,160
how all the things go physically

58
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,599
so who is called reagan

59
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:45,440
call dragon is a north korean apt group

60
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,760
but there are so many north korean apd

61
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,840
groups which one are you talking about

62
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:53,200
lazarus or dark soul

63
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:55,519
there are a lot of names that you might

64
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:58,000
heard previously and that can be

65
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,080
connected to the cloud dragon we're

66
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,519
talking about today

67
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:06,000
including apd-37 and kimsuki

68
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,519
several years ago back in 2018

69
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:14,640
we connected the apt-37 with the kimsuki

70
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:18,879
by the same shell code we found however

71
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:21,920
after years of sample collection and

72
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:24,400
also more evidence you gathered and

73
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,519
analyzed

74
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:28,080
we found that there are actually

75
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,480
several significant differences between

76
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:31,840
these two

77
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,200
groups

78
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:37,280
as a result we decided to go with this

79
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,319
way

80
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:42,879
the apd-37 will remains to be apd37

81
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:44,879
while the kimsuki group would divide

82
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:48,560
divided into two different categories

83
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:52,159
for the kimsuki disclosed by kaspersky

84
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:54,560
back in 2013

85
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:57,840
it will become the kim dragon group on

86
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,439
our side

87
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:02,159
and for the public known kimsuki

88
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:04,239
which are the thing that you will read

89
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:05,920
on news

90
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,519
they have been launching the text in

91
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:10,879
recent years and also the kimsuki um

92
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:13,040
disclosing several security vendors

93
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,400
reports

94
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,639
this is the cloud dragon we are going to

95
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:18,560
talk about today

96
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,720
so why do we divide it

97
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,720
into two groups and what's the

98
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,400
difference

99
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:27,360
uh we will go like this way to be brief

100
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,240
and clear divided by malware and the

101
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,440
target

102
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,600
there are still some something they

103
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,840
share together but there are

104
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:38,400
differences as well

105
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,120
so

106
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,840
what's the similarities

107
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:44,240
first the target

108
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,000
they both of the group

109
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,800
they their primary target are south

110
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,560
korea for sure because they are from

111
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,840
north korea

112
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:54,160
and the united states

113
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:57,120
and they are all favored in government

114
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,600
agencies and education

115
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,639
including like university or research

116
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:04,400
institutes

117
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,440
however

118
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:08,400
when we look back to its malware we are

119
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:11,440
using totally different tools

120
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:14,639
for cold dragon they use malware like

121
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:15,919
troy bomb

122
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:17,039
roast me

123
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:19,280
dream bug or you might hear others

124
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,520
called it like apple seed

125
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:24,240
and their favorite one baby shark doma

126
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,720
raid or wild command

127
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,560
and for king dragon

128
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:31,600
they use variance from different mower

129
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,000
like the gold dragon variants which we

130
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,160
call them love xxx

131
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:39,759
or the navratri reliant or even a mirror

132
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:41,520
script

133
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,120
and for the target they are also

134
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,479
different

135
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:47,280
we found that cloud dragon uh they have

136
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,199
a broader um

137
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:50,720
country favored

138
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:53,840
we've observed them attacking japan and

139
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:56,160
also several countries in the europa

140
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,600
region

141
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,000
but for cream dragon we only

142
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,039
found it attacking another asia country

143
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:04,960
india

144
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:08,160
and for the industry part cloud dragon

145
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,840
has a a

146
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:14,000
relative relatively broad uh

147
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,600
target scope

148
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,840
they attack financial

149
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:19,120
institutes

150
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:22,880
energy high-tech companies and of course

151
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:25,600
aerospace and defense

152
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,840
there's something we like to note it is

153
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,919
that

154
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:32,720
why we are here instead of meeting

155
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:35,440
everyone face-to-face is because as you

156
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,680
know because of kobet 19.

157
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:40,639
and colbert 19 of course is the hottest

158
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:43,280
topic of this last year

159
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:45,199
cloud dragon

160
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:47,680
similar to other apd groups they use a

161
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:51,039
lot of theme with covet 19 to viewer

162
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:54,560
their victims to their their targets

163
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:57,280
and moreover there's a there are a lot

164
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:00,080
of news or reports talking about north

165
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:03,039
korean apts attacking like vaccine

166
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:05,120
providers or

167
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:07,440
research institutes that are

168
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:10,400
researched on the covet 19

169
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,680
virus

170
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:14,880
or have been attacked actually that's

171
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,960
the group they are talking about is the

172
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:20,960
cloud dragon we are talking about today

173
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:24,560
in the following two slides we are going

174
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,880
to share how we put all the things

175
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,000
together

176
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:28,800
which

177
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,360
what i'm talking about is how we put the

178
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:34,000
infrastructure and how the malware are

179
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,039
divided into what is being used by call

180
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:39,840
dragon or by kim dragon

181
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:43,360
so this graph is for cloud dragon case

182
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:47,199
started from his favorite uh mauer using

183
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:49,280
other countries rather than in south

184
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:52,400
korean baby shark we can see that that

185
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,240
that baby shark

186
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,360
uh

187
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:58,960
can was found posted on a domain

188
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:02,479
which pointed a resolve to a ip address

189
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:04,560
and the iv address can be linked to

190
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:07,199
another domain which has a gembach

191
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:09,280
malware on it

192
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:12,319
at the same time the jambot

193
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:14,879
can also be linked to another domain

194
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:19,199
that has a troy bomb malware

195
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:22,319
moreover the troy bond malware can be

196
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:25,520
also linked to another domain right here

197
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:29,120
it and the domain pointed to another ip

198
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,160
which

199
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:33,120
resolves to another domain and it will

200
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,958
we will see rows me

201
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:36,640
on the domain

202
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,799
so what about domain rate

203
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:41,200
back to the the upper part part right

204
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,559
here

205
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:44,800
you can see that doma red actually

206
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:48,000
shared the same ip address with baby

207
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,399
shark

208
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:52,320
in king dragon clay

209
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,560
case it's similar

210
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:59,040
uh to be uh to go in a briefly way

211
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:03,040
um the bubble stealer and the love xxs

212
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:05,120
mower they share

213
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:08,640
the same fingerprints in the malware and

214
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:11,839
for the the nav red and the mirror

215
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:15,600
script they have the same boundary

216
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:18,640
and as i mentioned earlier the jinho

217
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:22,800
spine is a variant of navred which also

218
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:26,080
is uh will be downloaded by lovex

219
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:26,959
x

220
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:29,440
so all the things are put together in

221
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,760
this way

222
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:35,120
also i like to uh highlight

223
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:38,240
there's a significant difference in

224
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,320
their

225
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,959
preferences in providers of

226
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:47,119
infrastructure providers using

227
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:51,600
i will make a briefly introduction of

228
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,760
cloud dragon's malware

229
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,640
this is the malware timeline based on

230
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,640
our overstation

231
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:03,440
first is troy bob which use fda php as

232
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,920
its receiver

233
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:10,320
it was first thing in 2017.

234
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:14,160
it's an old malware but we can observe

235
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,240
it today

236
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,120
next

237
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,959
is the green one

238
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:21,279
rosemary

239
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:24,240
rosemary used ftp as

240
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:27,200
its communication protocol

241
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:31,360
the account and password are hardcoded

242
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:34,240
in the vector

243
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,640
its active period

244
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:40,360
is in 2019

245
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:43,920
now let's move on to the blue one jump

246
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,440
back

247
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,399
jumper

248
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:48,079
or a

249
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:51,120
is the latest main weapon of cloud

250
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,240
dragon

251
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:56,760
since the end of 2019

252
00:10:57,279 --> 00:11:00,480
i will make a detailed analysis in the

253
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,560
next page

254
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:06,399
and now let's look on the red one baby

255
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:08,240
shark

256
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:12,880
baby shop is a script-based backdoor

257
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:15,920
its payload is equipped with a special

258
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:19,600
transportation cipher algorithm

259
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:22,959
this tool is usually to attack countries

260
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:26,480
other than south korea

261
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,399
the final one is

262
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:29,920
don murray

263
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:33,920
also known as white comment

264
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:37,680
it got this name because of using animal

265
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:40,399
naming for its commit

266
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:44,000
however we had only observed it in last

267
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,240
year

268
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:51,360
since dream bug is widely used by cloud

269
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,560
dragon

270
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,880
i am going to show the detailed

271
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,519
technique of jumbach

272
00:11:57,519 --> 00:11:58,480
first

273
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:02,079
let's talk about its name

274
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:06,160
in the earlier version it used apoc or

275
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,600
incubation

276
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,480
as

277
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:09,279
it

278
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:11,279
parties none

279
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:15,200
we translate incubation into korea

280
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:18,399
which is jump back

281
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:21,920
i know that the pronunciation of this

282
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:25,360
world is actually tom ball

283
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:27,920
in korea

284
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:31,519
but to let people easier remember we use

285
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:35,440
the roman pronunciation

286
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:36,959
here

287
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:39,600
is some common delivered method of

288
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,120
jailback

289
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:44,560
the actor usually package malware using

290
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:45,839
script

291
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:50,240
installer or fake execution file

292
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:52,959
the dropper will drop jump back

293
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:55,040
and decoy file

294
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,760
at the same time

295
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:01,360
most of dream bug will install to a path

296
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:04,959
since like windows defender and then as

297
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:09,439
auto update dot dll

298
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:12,399
there is always a s4 function

299
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:15,200
dl register server

300
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,800
in jump bug

301
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:19,839
the dl reduce server is the default

302
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:22,720
entry point of csun tool

303
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:26,160
reduce server 32

304
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:30,320
jamba use reduce server as its launcher

305
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,880
instead of run dl

306
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:35,760
and in some version it will inject

307
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:38,480
itself into explorer

308
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,160
which makes it

309
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:42,570
more invisible

310
00:13:42,570 --> 00:13:45,040
[Music]

311
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:50,399
dreambox use web service as a cnc server

312
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:53,760
there are file protocol in germ bug

313
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,760
pin a heartbeat

314
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:59,600
upload the file download the command

315
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:05,120
delete the command and update itself

316
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:09,120
and there are five main functions

317
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,560
in dreambug

318
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:13,199
screenshot keylog

319
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:14,639
file upload

320
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:18,000
and exclusion show comment

321
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:18,880
are

322
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:22,959
very common in general backdoor

323
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:25,760
and the plugin function here

324
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:28,959
make this vector unique

325
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:31,839
because actually can do many tricks by

326
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:35,760
using this spatial photogram

327
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:39,760
all of files in dreambug are encrypt in

328
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:44,639
the data structure show us below

329
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:47,519
in the beginning of file

330
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:49,760
there is a metric header

331
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:53,680
discussed as pdf file

332
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:57,600
and the following of four bytes is its

333
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:00,079
check sum

334
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:01,760
next

335
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:04,240
the green one is a

336
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:08,880
16 bytes random journal red key

337
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,639
using this key

338
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:13,839
the remaining data can be decreased with

339
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:19,360
a variant s or inclusion algorithm

340
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:26,079
ok let's talk about some case studies

341
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:28,720
from some famous supply chain attack

342
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:31,600
cast such as shadow hammer

343
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,040
solar winds

344
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:36,160
we can know that supply chain attack is

345
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:39,440
not an easy work and it always makes a

346
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,680
big impact

347
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:45,600
most anti-virus cannot detect malicious

348
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:48,240
application modified

349
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,199
by

350
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:50,079
threat

351
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:53,120
actor because the supply chain attack

352
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:58,160
file always are signed with certificate

353
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:01,360
the victim will execute the application

354
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,440
with trust

355
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:06,800
okay so i'm going to show a supply chain

356
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:10,479
attack of cloud dragon

357
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:13,279
the supply chain attack down by cloud

358
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:17,040
dragon occurred last year

359
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:20,839
the target industry is korean

360
00:16:20,839 --> 00:16:24,240
cryptocurrency crowd dragon ends at a

361
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,639
hardware wallet service

362
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:30,079
compared with software wallets

363
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:32,320
however raleigh usually

364
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:35,440
specializes in security

365
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:38,240
but it still needs software to access

366
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:41,839
blockchain on the internet

367
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:45,360
they made a malicious version of its

368
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,600
management software

369
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:51,680
the software is built in nws a

370
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,839
browser-based framework

371
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:56,639
like electron

372
00:16:56,639 --> 00:16:58,639
the javascript file

373
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:02,000
are compiled in nwjs

374
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,919
therefore we have high confidence that

375
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:10,319
the actor matter the source code

376
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:14,400
cloud dragon changed the configuration

377
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,359
file

378
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:17,119
of the installer

379
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:18,640
kasse

380
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,319
set up

381
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:24,160
and deploy to the official site

382
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:27,520
if 15 launch this installer

383
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:32,000
it will download a malicious management

384
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,240
application

385
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:37,039
k-a-s-s-e from c2

386
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:40,320
compared to original one in this

387
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:41,679
malicious

388
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:43,200
application

389
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,280
there are three files

390
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:48,080
been temporary with

391
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:49,360
constant

392
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:50,240
dim

393
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:54,799
the bin index.bin and main.bin

394
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:56,559
we can find some

395
00:17:56,559 --> 00:17:59,440
c2 strings in those files

396
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:03,280
with summarize cloud dragon get those

397
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:06,400
get lots of users data and install

398
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:07,919
backdoor

399
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:12,080
maybe dream back to big teams

400
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:15,440
cloud dragon not only attack computer

401
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:18,960
users but also mobile users

402
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:22,320
they deploy a malicious app to google

403
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:23,919
play

404
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:24,799
if

405
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:27,679
15 turn on auto update

406
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:30,400
the malware will be installed without

407
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,240
notice

408
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:34,559
compare with the origin

409
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:37,200
app here and here

410
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:41,520
the malicious one will upload users data

411
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:45,760
to see to in the background

412
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:47,919
moreover

413
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:51,840
an alert was issued officially

414
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:54,960
they weren't user not to believe

415
00:18:54,960 --> 00:19:00,760
the content of email from htactech.info

416
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:04,559
this domain does not belong to official

417
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:07,039
with sermons cloud dragon stole the

418
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:11,360
database and delivered lots email

419
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:14,640
for vision and install their

420
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:17,200
malware

421
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:21,520
we put all mentioned indicator together

422
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:26,480
and extend the cognition using past dns

423
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:28,080
subdomain

424
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:30,799
and service providers

425
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:34,240
as we can see from the graph

426
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:37,679
all of them are related

427
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:39,919
the service provider

428
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:44,240
are resent as cloud dragon used before

429
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:46,320
we discover

430
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,559
a dream box c2

431
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:51,200
use related domain

432
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:54,080
therefore we attribute this supply chain

433
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:57,039
attack to cloud dragon

434
00:19:57,039 --> 00:19:58,960
final with surmise

435
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:01,360
they will strengthen

436
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:05,280
stranger infrastructure by using those

437
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:07,679
virtual money obtained

438
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:10,880
from this attack

439
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:16,080
the next is the fishing skills of cloud

440
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:18,080
dragon group

441
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:20,159
i guess most of you are trying to like

442
00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:22,240
turn down the volumes or skip this

443
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:24,799
session for now because you you will

444
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:26,799
think that oh my god it's another

445
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:27,840
fishing

446
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:30,400
every ipt groups use fish and it's not a

447
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:33,600
news and it's nothing different

448
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,360
um i will say

449
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:38,640
cloud dragon is the best uh in fishing

450
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,880
among all the apt groups since you have

451
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,960
to have the whole picture of all the apd

452
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,559
groups to say so

453
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:48,640
but we believe that they definitely rank

454
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:51,840
in the top tier of the in the fishing

455
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:53,200
aspects

456
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:56,000
why do we say that

457
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,080
uh in this picture we can see three

458
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:01,679
different portal uh that's mainly used

459
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:04,720
in korea but also in elsewhere

460
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:06,320
in the middle is

461
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:09,280
the login page of apple id

462
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:10,720
some of you might

463
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:12,159
confuse now

464
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:15,440
is apple unpopular in korea

465
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:18,400
actually although samsung

466
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:20,799
they have the greatest market share in

467
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:23,760
either mobile or that laptops

468
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,679
however uh

469
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:27,600
one of the reasons they can have that

470
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,600
kind of market share is because they

471
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,840
have different they they cover all kinds

472
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:34,480
of models to different users

473
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:38,320
but we if we look at this the numbers uh

474
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:41,840
in the most popular mobile phones in

475
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:44,559
south korea back in 2019 i guess

476
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:46,080
we can see that

477
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:47,360
three of them

478
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:49,600
are actually iphone

479
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:52,880
and that's only for the the mobile part

480
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:55,039
for the there are a lot of users also

481
00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:57,280
using mac in korea as well

482
00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:00,720
so apple uh the login page of apple is

483
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,240
actually

484
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:05,919
quite normal in korea as well

485
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:08,240
on the left and on the right

486
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:11,280
they are both on north korean local

487
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:12,960
portal web portal

488
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,559
dom and never

489
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:16,960
and together they accounted for

490
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:19,600
more than 80 percent of the market share

491
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:22,720
in the portal market

492
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:26,320
so what's the connection of these three

493
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:29,520
public service with cloud dragon

494
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:32,320
they abuse them so these three public

495
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:35,039
servants are all are all abused by cloud

496
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:36,240
dragon group

497
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:38,320
uh in their attacks

498
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:40,400
but that's not the the

499
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,159
whole story

500
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:44,880
this uh the graph shows uh

501
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:47,520
started from an iv owned by cloud dragon

502
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:49,840
there are different domains uh created

503
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:51,120
by the group

504
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:53,360
and we can see there are four different

505
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:54,960
categories

506
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:59,200
that are quite stand out from others

507
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:00,400
on the

508
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:02,799
the two part on the left and the right

509
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:05,280
it shows the what i mentioned earlier

510
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:06,799
dom and never

511
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:09,600
however we can also see them using

512
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:12,880
outlook and google which implies that

513
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:15,840
they are not only using the domestic uh

514
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:17,840
service but also

515
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:20,640
to the global service so their targets

516
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:24,720
are not only inside of korea but also to

517
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:28,480
other countries in other regions

518
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:32,720
these are uh the other um

519
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:35,600
targets that been targeted by clown

520
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:36,799
dragon group

521
00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:39,919
as you can see they are from different

522
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:42,799
universities and actually three of them

523
00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:44,240
are all

524
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:48,240
famous one in south korea

525
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:52,480
i won't name it out but all of them are

526
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:55,039
for sure target by the cloud dragon

527
00:23:55,039 --> 00:23:57,279
group

528
00:23:57,919 --> 00:24:00,240
there are more on the list for sure um i

529
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:02,960
will i would like to focus on the the

530
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:05,120
one on the right

531
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:08,720
which has a big outlook logo on it

532
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:11,520
if you take a closer look you will see

533
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:15,279
the url ends with tr

534
00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:16,559
which means

535
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:18,559
turkey so yes

536
00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:21,600
outside of south korea and united states

537
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,039
cloud dragon

538
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:26,000
has been trying or has already

539
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,679
intrude uh turkey company or turkish

540
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:32,679
service

541
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,400
then we are going to intro introduce the

542
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,400
new technique we found in claude

543
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:41,600
dragon's attacks proxy mirror

544
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:44,400
let's take a look at the upper place the

545
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,960
url in the upper place which we gather

546
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:49,120
from the victim side

547
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:52,000
the blue part the user id enable the

548
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,880
actors to auto automatically

549
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,880
automatically

550
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:59,360
fill in the fishing sites

551
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:01,919
so the users will believe that they are

552
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:05,039
using the real websites

553
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:07,679
and the user uh the proxy mode is to

554
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:09,919
send in special cookie

555
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:13,679
while the target url is the website they

556
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:15,600
are going to fetch

557
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,600
so what does that mean

558
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:20,400
let's take a look at the workflow

559
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,080
at the bottom

560
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:26,080
first the victim will have to like open

561
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:28,720
a link a malicious link they receive

562
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:30,559
from the official email

563
00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:33,600
and then the phishing site will at the

564
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:36,480
same time send a request to the real

565
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:38,080
website

566
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:40,320
fetch the content

567
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:43,039
modify the content and show

568
00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:45,520
the content on the fashion sites so

569
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:48,960
actually the the users cannot uh

570
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:51,679
distinguish whether they are using the

571
00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:53,679
wrong site

572
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:55,679
so proxy mirror

573
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:56,960
can

574
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:59,360
enable the actors to

575
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:02,400
auto update the content on the website

576
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:05,760
and not letting the users to discover it

577
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:09,039
which in other words reduced a lot of

578
00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:13,840
efforts will it will cost to the actors

579
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:17,360
last but not least

580
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:20,320
the third techniques we are to share

581
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:24,960
is the actor is pending their territory

582
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,720
to mobile

583
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:29,279
although we have mentioned

584
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:30,960
their footprint

585
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:33,679
in the supply chain attack

586
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:35,120
chapter

587
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:38,480
there is a more directory evidence

588
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:41,679
supporting our assumption

589
00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:42,640
yes

590
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:45,600
we found a malware on android

591
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:48,240
and this is like the first step how

592
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:50,880
cloud dragon will be landing to a

593
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:53,840
reality

594
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:58,559
now a day smartphone are widely used

595
00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:01,520
many people use smartphone more often

596
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:03,120
than computer

597
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:04,480
however

598
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:07,279
there are few security solutions on

599
00:27:07,279 --> 00:27:08,880
mobile

600
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:10,080
therefore

601
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:13,360
smartphones have become a new target

602
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:17,600
of apt groups and cloud dragon is not

603
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:20,600
exceptional

604
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:25,840
we observed an android malware

605
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:27,919
in the wild

606
00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:31,279
it used the same metric header and

607
00:27:31,279 --> 00:27:34,399
similar file inclusion structure

608
00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:37,919
a stream box on windows

609
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:38,880
here

610
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:39,760
the

611
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:42,320
pdf like

612
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:44,159
magic header

613
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:45,600
moreover

614
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:50,559
the url pattern is less than

615
00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:54,000
loss we believe this is an android dream

616
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,240
bug

617
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,520
some functions of android dream book are

618
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:04,159
like lost on windows

619
00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:06,880
it can upload file

620
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:09,039
execution show command

621
00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:12,080
and update itself

622
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:13,760
for smartphone

623
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:14,960
it

624
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:16,399
was add new

625
00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:20,000
sms related functions

626
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,840
look here

627
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:22,720
this

628
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:28,320
get osms function will package all sms

629
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:30,399
into one file

630
00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:31,360
and

631
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:32,720
compress

632
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:35,520
with zip

633
00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:37,279
the zipped

634
00:28:37,279 --> 00:28:38,240
file

635
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:39,919
will be encrypt

636
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:43,679
and upload to c2

637
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:46,720
compared to other android malware

638
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:50,080
dream bug is very simple

639
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:53,360
we believe it will add more powerful

640
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:54,480
function

641
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:56,799
such as screenshots

642
00:28:56,799 --> 00:29:01,120
video audio recording and gps location

643
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:03,840
in the future

644
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:07,919
so we've been introduced a lot of

645
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:11,200
techniques the group has been using or

646
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,399
is currently

647
00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:13,919
also using

648
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:14,799
now

649
00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:17,200
to go back to the topic we

650
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:19,840
talked at the very first time

651
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:22,240
how the nightmare become to a real

652
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:23,600
reality

653
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:27,200
is that we observe them going physical

654
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:29,919
how the how what does what do i mean by

655
00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:32,000
physical

656
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,760
um this is a screenshot of the code from

657
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:37,039
one of the

658
00:29:37,039 --> 00:29:40,640
plugins we observe uh in one of their

659
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:43,360
malware gem bug

660
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:45,360
if you take a closer look to the

661
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:47,600
screenshot you can see that

662
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:50,640
it shows they are actually doing audio

663
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:52,159
recording

664
00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:55,440
but why audio recording is so

665
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:58,880
so frightening to to all the people

666
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:02,320
uh imagine that uh when you are when you

667
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:04,799
are one of the victim of the group and

668
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:07,200
you have such plugin in inside your

669
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:09,520
laptop it means that

670
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:11,279
when you are having a meeting with your

671
00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:13,919
colleagues in a meeting room and there

672
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:15,600
are five people

673
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:18,320
actually there are more than five people

674
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:21,440
because at the same time accuracy are

675
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:23,919
actually recording what you guys are

676
00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:26,240
talking about or discussing about

677
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:29,120
and there are more than one actors so in

678
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:31,919
other words the meeting room is not uh

679
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:35,039
only five people but more than 10 i

680
00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:36,799
guess

681
00:30:36,799 --> 00:30:39,120
and there are actually a more

682
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:42,480
threatening part is uh the plugin which

683
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:45,200
is to do audio record

684
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:48,240
uh it allows actors to

685
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:52,080
record your life without the users using

686
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:53,600
the computer

687
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:55,760
what do we mean by that

688
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:58,240
it means that uh for the you uh the

689
00:30:58,240 --> 00:30:59,440
normal

690
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:02,000
functions such as keylogger or

691
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,279
screenshot

692
00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:06,720
it requires users to interact with their

693
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:09,600
devices so you have to like type in

694
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:12,640
something so the actor can do the key

695
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:13,760
logging

696
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:17,039
however for the audio part

697
00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:19,360
if even if you are doing nothing to your

698
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:21,440
computer you just leave it leave it

699
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:22,480
there

700
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:26,080
it is also recording your sound at the

701
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:28,320
same time

702
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:30,880
combining with what we mentioned earlier

703
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:34,159
like uh what doc had mentioned earlier

704
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:37,279
like the combination of

705
00:31:37,279 --> 00:31:39,120
cloud dragon moving to the mobile

706
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:40,480
platform

707
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:42,960
was the actors adding the audio

708
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:44,559
recording function

709
00:31:44,559 --> 00:31:47,279
to the mobile malware

710
00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:49,200
then it means that

711
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:52,080
their victim and their targets will be

712
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:56,080
accompanied by the actors 24 hours a day

713
00:31:56,080 --> 00:32:00,320
and seven days a week with non-stop

714
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:01,440
so

715
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:04,000
uh i hope we won't get

716
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,760
all of us won't get into nightmare

717
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:09,279
tonight so i'm going to stop right here

718
00:32:09,279 --> 00:32:11,360
and do a quick wrap up

719
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:14,159
um there are three key takeaways ways we

720
00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:16,399
mentioned earlier and we hope our

721
00:32:16,399 --> 00:32:19,200
audience can learn from it

722
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,399
first

723
00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:23,440
the actors of cloud dragon they are

724
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:25,200
capable of launching supply chain

725
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:26,960
attacks

726
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:29,440
as we all know that supply chain attacks

727
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:31,919
it requires more resources and more

728
00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:34,480
techniques to be involved

729
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:36,480
uh this is not going to be a one-time

730
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:38,799
attack once you have the ability to

731
00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:40,559
launch such attacks

732
00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:43,679
it will only be more attacks observed or

733
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:46,720
not observed in the near future

734
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:50,080
so we would like to uh advise all of the

735
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:52,159
audience to to take a

736
00:32:52,159 --> 00:32:55,919
uh like take a essay alert to your own

737
00:32:55,919 --> 00:32:57,519
unit

738
00:32:57,519 --> 00:33:00,080
the second part is they are improving

739
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:02,159
their fishing skills

740
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:04,559
they are not only applying the

741
00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:06,559
traditional ways like spear phishing

742
00:33:06,559 --> 00:33:10,159
emails sending to their victims or so on

743
00:33:10,159 --> 00:33:12,799
they're trying to like reduce the

744
00:33:12,799 --> 00:33:15,919
efforts caused to their actors and try

745
00:33:15,919 --> 00:33:18,000
to make all the things

746
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,159
into auto auto

747
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:21,760
automated

748
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:24,240
so they can have time and have the

749
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:25,519
resource to

750
00:33:25,519 --> 00:33:28,080
to like invest to other development on

751
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:31,440
malware or on the techniques they use

752
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:33,519
and the third part is

753
00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:36,159
they are not only limited to windows

754
00:33:36,159 --> 00:33:37,360
platform

755
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:40,159
so it will not only affect it on the

756
00:33:40,159 --> 00:33:41,360
laptop

757
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:44,320
system but also to other platforms which

758
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:46,799
we yet observe them

759
00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:50,240
on the android and android is currently

760
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:53,600
the most popular with the most

761
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:55,919
the greatest market share in mobile

762
00:33:55,919 --> 00:33:58,799
phone system

763
00:33:58,799 --> 00:34:02,640
to finish the this talk and to conduct

764
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:05,120
our research we have a lot of reference

765
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:07,440
from different reports and from

766
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:09,440
different uh

767
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:10,719
researchers

768
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:12,399
like we show here

769
00:34:12,399 --> 00:34:14,560
so thank everyone

770
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:15,440
this

771
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:17,280
is the end of our

772
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:19,918
speech thank you for attention may you

you want to discuss more on this group

775
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:27,280
or their techniques we mentioned earlier

776
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:28,079
or

777
00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:29,199
