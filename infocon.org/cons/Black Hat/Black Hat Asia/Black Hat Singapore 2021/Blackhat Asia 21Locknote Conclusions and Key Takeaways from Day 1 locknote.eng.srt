00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:17,039
hi there and

3
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:20,160
welcome to black hat asia day one lock

4
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:21,119
note

5
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:23,920
uh i hope you all had a great day of

6
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:26,160
really insightful and educational

7
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:27,920
presentations today

8
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:30,160
um from what i saw there certainly were

9
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:33,920
a great mix of both deep technical talks

10
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:37,200
uh like the job rocket um which went

11
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,920
right and which was uh

12
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:42,640
extremely detailed and gave one of my

13
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:45,600
favorite comparisons which was comparing

14
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:46,559
a job

15
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:49,280
to cats with rockets strapped to their

16
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:52,399
backs burning down castles which is a

17
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:54,399
awesome start to the day

18
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:56,320
and just paints the picture for the rest

19
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,760
of the day

20
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:00,320
that went right through to higher level

21
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:03,520
talks including uh the keynote by troy

22
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:04,400
hunt

23
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,400
and another by one of our own review

24
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,680
board members

25
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:10,240
around some of the risks to security

26
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:11,760
researchers in

27
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:14,080
surveillance states

28
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:16,400
i'm pleased to introduce you to some of

29
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,960
the blackout asia review board members

30
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:21,920
who worked tirelessly for

31
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,640
many months reviewing hundreds of very

32
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,720
top quality submissions

33
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:30,479
uh to bring you blackout asia 2021 and

34
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:32,240
um from the outcomes that we've seen

35
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:35,520
today i think is really was a successful

36
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:38,400
day and um you know me personally i got

37
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,560
a lot of value out of that

38
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:43,920
uh so i'd like to introduce you to uh

39
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,520

and

43
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:55,439
basically i'd like to start by

44
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:58,479
going around the table and um allowing

45
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:01,040
each of our review board members to just

46
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:03,520
give a bit of a quick introduction about

47
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:05,439
themselves so that you know their

48
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:06,719
background

49
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:09,199
and also just provide a

50
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:11,599
good insight into their highlight for

51
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:14,400
the day and just hear uh from the review

52
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,280
board um you know their thoughts and

53
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,520
some of the key takeaways uh that they

54
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,800
had from uh blackout asia day one

55
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,000
uh please feel free to submit questions

56
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,680
um in the chat

57
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:30,400
and uh we'll get to as many of those as

58
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,680
we can

59
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,680
um so i'm going to hand across to

60
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:34,879
cameron

61
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:38,160
as the first to give a bit of background

62
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,400
and also just open up the conversation

63
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,480
around what you found really useful for

64
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:43,680
today

65
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:46,319
thank you ty um what a fun day it was

66
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:47,760
today i had a great time watching all

67
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:50,000
these talks my big problem was deciding

68
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,920
which ones to choose because lots of

69
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:53,519
them are all at the same time

70
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:55,760
um just introduce myself i'm pam o'shea

71
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,920
i'm based in melbourne i specialize in

72
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,680
pen testing

73
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,920
i enjoy web app hacking and radio

74
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:04,239
hacking so they're my two main interests

75
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:06,080
um my favorite talk today even though it

76
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,599
was very hard to choose but if i'm

77
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:09,040
forced to choose one it would be the

78
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:11,680
give me sql injection talk i shall phone

79
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:15,200
ios and sql server it was a fantastic

80
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:18,080
talk it just kept going in terms of its

81
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:20,720
impact and the research they did the

82
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,319
fuzzing they did i can't believe they

83
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:24,080
found all those bugs within a month or

84
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,000
two of fuzzing

85
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,840
and the main idea behind the talk was

86
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,720
that if they obtained sql injection but

87
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,159
i think tai you mentioned today it's

88
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:33,680
like they've made secret injection

89
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,840
better again so they've taken that

90
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:36,799
further

91
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:39,680
and via you know older protocols like

92
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:42,480
webdav they're able to do a call out to

93
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:43,760
a

94
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:46,879
a file hosted by a malicious actor and

95
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:49,360
that file actually grooms the heap and

96
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,360
then you can crash iis and do other

97
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,680
exploits based on that and it was just a

98
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:56,319
fantastic talk and i loved that it's a

99
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:58,400
legacy bug it's been there for 20 years

100
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,400
they've gone all the way back to xp and

101
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:03,280
proven it's still there in all 32 bits

102
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,760
um 32-bit applications and then it's one

103
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,920
instance in the 64-bit

104
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,200
the other thing that was great they just

105
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,799
you know went through all of that and

106
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:12,080
then at the very end they just kind of

107
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,080
casually mentioned oh you can probably

108
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,079
do privilege escalation through token

109
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:18,399
kidnapping as well and maybe good system

110
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:19,279
so

111
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:20,560
nice and

112
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,479
also they're working on local attack

113
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:24,240
surfaces as well so they mentioned

114
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,759
they're already starting their research

115
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:27,759
for the next black hat submission so

116
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:29,360
definitely brilliant resources

117
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,120
researchers to watch there i thoroughly

118
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,280
enjoyed it and i almost needed popcorn

119
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:36,239
it was so much fun so

120
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,520
yeah

121
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:40,840
i have to admit that was also one of my

122
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:44,160
favorite you know i just think that uh

123
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,680
it's got

124
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,759
such an impact and i remember seeing

125
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:50,080
this talk when when we were reviewing

126
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,440
the submissions

127
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:54,240
um before blackout and it was one that

128
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,560
really caught my eye just because of

129
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,800
the absolute critical

130
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,240
nature of this

131
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,720
and also the question around

132
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:05,280
you know uh how's microsoft going to

133
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,919
address this you know um

134
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:09,919
you know they don't they don't even have

135
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:12,560
like it's a it's basically a legacy

136
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:15,520
product that's distributed in every

137
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:18,160
version of windows

138
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,720
yeah they're like and it's

139
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:23,120
it's one of the issues with you know a

140
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,639
wonderful corporation like microsoft

141
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:27,360
that gives us compatibility with at the

142
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,160
cost of you know technical debt and

143
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,479
increased attack surface so

144
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:34,639
yeah it was just wonderful research and

145
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:35,520
nice

146
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,039
inspiring action

147
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:39,520
yeah it's interesting to see that um

148
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,440
you know it's they've sort of presented

149
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:44,560
it uh you know through uh sql server and

150
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:47,199
iis because that was the critical attack

151
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:50,160
vector but because things like uh

152
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,720
microsoft office and w script and those

153
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,240
sort of things also

154
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:57,520
uh hook into uh database engines and

155
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,600
they support things like jet

156
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,919
uh that you know they can potentially be

157
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:04,319
vulnerable as well um it's just that

158
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:07,039
that really wasn't the core target that

159
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:09,280
they were going after

160
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:12,080
you know and they revealed that

161
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:15,039
uh through things like um

162
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:17,440
you know sql server you could actually

163
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:20,240
force uh by using the open data source

164
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:23,199
and open reset um commands that you

165
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:26,000
could uh actually force it to use the

166
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,120
jet direct

167
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,960
the jet engine

168
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:32,880
to then connect to a remote

169
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,560
a remote database

170
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,039
via a unc path so you can basically send

171
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:40,319
it out to any remote database to then

172
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:43,039
download malicious uh content and

173
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:45,600
trigger the bugs yeah really scary stuff

174
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:49,680
it's really good yeah yeah yeah the um

175
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:52,720
they also mentioned that um

176
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:55,039
i asked them during the talk uh if

177
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:56,720
they'll be releasing the exploits for

178
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,960
these and um

179
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,720
they said not right now because they're

180
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:03,039
still in talks with microsoft

181
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:05,199
and uh just because of the criticality

182
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:07,199
of these exploits and the fact that you

183
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:09,120
can actually exploit them through sql

184
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,319
injection

185
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:11,199
uh

186
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:12,560
means that they're obviously highly

187
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,720
critical but also

188
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,400
microsoft basically

189
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:19,120
can't fix all of these so

190
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,160
you know

191
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,319
releasing the exploits is obviously

192
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:25,759
going to be a very bad thing and um

193
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:27,919
you know it'll be interesting and one of

194
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:30,400
the final statements they made is

195
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:31,599
that

196
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:34,080
um you know they believe these

197
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,840
it's actually going to be around for a

198
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:36,960
long time

199
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,720
so definitely they'll be in the

200
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,319
pentester arsenal

201
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:41,759
very soon i think

202
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:43,520
that's right agreed yeah so i think

203
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,599
there's a lot of research to be done

204
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:47,039
around that jet

205
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:48,479
engine again

206
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:51,360
awesome uh thanks pamela i'll jump over

207
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:54,080
to nikka

208
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,639
a bit of background about yourself and

209
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:58,000
you've already done that today through

210
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
your presentation it's uh in the

211
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,240
background again and uh yeah what did

212
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:05,120
you find interesting from today sure uh

213
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,440
hi everyone nice to be back at black hat

214
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:10,720
virtually um my name is mika i work in

215
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:13,759
digital forensics an incident response

216
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:16,639
uh for a company based out of london

217
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:18,080
also in the us

218
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:21,120
and i've been a review board guest

219
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,280
review board member for a few years for

220
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,919
blackhead asia and us

221
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:28,400
primarily focused on incident response

222
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,319
and network security

223
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:32,080
uh outside of

224
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,080
of work i

225
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:34,958
have

226
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:36,799
dabbled in teaching was an assistant

227
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:39,360
professor at hong kong university

228
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:43,599
um for a semester and you know

229
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:45,680
outside of that also looking looking to

230
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,760
do more teaching um

231
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:50,000
today was great there were a ton of

232
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,440
awesome talks

233
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,560
uh

234
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:55,760
hard to pick one that that stood out

235
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:58,720
all that much but having spent time

236
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:01,279
in several electric vehicles i had to

237
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:03,279
attend the talk on the tesla

238
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:05,600
supercharging stations

239
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,160
and i found that that talk to be

240
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,760
fascinating

241
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,760
the

242
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:14,080
the protocols that they're fuzzing and

243
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,640
looking to manipulate also

244
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,240
kind of like

245
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,640
open up the world of possibility you

246
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,080
know there are thousands of these

247
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,480
supercharging stations now

248
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:27,920
um with so many automakers

249
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,680
you know pledging to switch to all

250
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:32,480
electronic vehicles in the next five

251
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,320
years ten years

252
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,640
you have to think that you know is the

253
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,720
security going to keep up

254
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:41,519
so i found that very thought provoking i

255
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:43,760
found that they're um

256
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:46,240
they were very creative in how they

257
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,000
kind of programmed this interplay

258
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,080
between the charging station and the

259
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,279
canvas

260
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:52,959
uh it seemed like a lot of research went

261
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:55,200
into it and also you know the the

262
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,920
possibilities are are many so it sounds

263
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,440
like they'll be releasing some code

264
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,600
where you can go kind of hyper program

265
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,120
your own little

266
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,440
i forgot what they call it maybe a can

267
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,399
spy

268
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:09,040
um little raspberry pi device

269
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:12,399
but found that to be impactful and again

270
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:13,920
just with the number of charging

271
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,440
stations growing

272
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,800
um

273
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,560
and the number of manufacturers that are

274
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:20,240
going to keep making these it just could

275
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,079
be a really interesting field of

276
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:23,440
research

277
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,360
and i always appreciate some of that

278
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,600
tinkering

279
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,560
outside of that um definitely a lot of

280
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:33,360
good talks and and you know always good

281
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,399
to hear

282
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:37,519
from the creator of have i been pwned

283
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:39,279
of course

284
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:40,079
so

285
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:44,160
i'll hand it over to uh fyodor

286
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:49,839
hello um my name is fyodor yarochkin

287
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:51,519
some people pronounce my last name as

288
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:53,040
the chicken there is no chicken in my

289
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,240
last name

290
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:57,200
i'm a threat researcher with uh micro

291
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:00,160
i'm based in taiwan i'm originally like

292
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,399
russian born in ukraine

293
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:05,600
uh lived in kyrgyzstan for a while uh

294
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,839
but i'm based in taiwan for like past 20

295
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:10,160
years so i'm quite familiar with the

296
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:12,320
community here but any questions you

297
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,440
have to

298
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:16,079
like original kind of like people folks

299
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:17,040
trends

300
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:19,279
uh and probably dry guardians

301
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:20,640
so um

302
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:23,680
i uh in terms of my expertise i've both

303
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:26,480
been doing penetration testing like

304
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,720
in the early days also like in this

305
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,000
region

306
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,240
and more recently i switched into like

307
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:34,000
more like defensive technologies like

308
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,800
investigation of the crime cases so

309
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:39,519
my interest uh when i look at the talks

310
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:41,200
might be slightly different i'm not so

311
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,519
much interested in offensive

312
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:45,519
technologies but also offensive and

313
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:46,800
defensive

314
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:47,680
uh

315
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:50,639
techniques or something that might be

316
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:54,160
um just innovative for like cross domain

317
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:57,279
and in this slide i think my favorite

318
00:11:57,279 --> 00:11:59,839
talk uh of the day

319
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:02,320
would be uh

320
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:05,920
the talk uh on the correlations

321
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:08,320
between uh

322
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,600
incidents

323
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,800
and uh stock prices the actual uh name

324
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,560
of the talk is a walk through historical

325
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,240
relations between vulnerabilities and

326
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,600
stock prices

327
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,120
i think

328
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:21,440
like one of the main reasons why

329
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:25,200
i picked up this talk is we all uh

330
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,040
know that it's out there if a company

331
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:28,399
gets breached

332
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:30,079
there's probably going to be some

333
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:32,720
economical impact on

334
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,320
on that company right

335
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,839
but uh

336
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:38,160
what alessandro did in this particular

337
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:41,040
case he actually uh mathematically

338
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:43,600
analyzed and showed was the diagrams and

339
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:44,959
excel sheets

340
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:46,800
that this is what happens to your stock

341
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:49,680
price when you uh get breached because

342
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:51,519
sometimes you might be wondering

343
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:53,279
uh

344
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:55,680
there is company a that got compromised

345
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,839
and their stock price went

346
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:00,160
while there's company b that had similar

347
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:02,800
incidents and they their stock price

348
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:05,600
didn't go up but even went

349
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,360
uh green go down it even went up a

350
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,680
little bit like for example the resin

351
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:11,519
bridge was quanta if you guys were

352
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:13,680
paying attention i was surprised if you

353
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,279
look at the stock price of quanta it

354
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:17,279
didn't go down it actually went up

355
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:18,959
little bit because

356
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:21,200
the company like less known company

357
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,920
actually got some exposure so what i

358
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:26,560
loved about this talk that uh alexander

359
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,399
actually looked into

360
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:31,760
what factors could potentially impact

361
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:33,839
like the factors related to the breach

362
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:35,680
could potentially in fact apologize

363
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,440
there is a cat on the ground

364
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,760
impact uh

365
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:42,399
the stock price fluctuation so he had

366
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:46,560
numbers he had sheets and uh yeah that's

367
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:49,680
uh like i i had some questions maybe

368
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:51,360
uh there would be other talks that i

369
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,760
would put on top but that's the thought

370
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,600
that i would pick up the most

371
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,199
interesting one

372
00:13:57,199 --> 00:13:59,920
with this i think uh

373
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:02,399
i will hand uh

374
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:03,360
the

375
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,040
microphone

376
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:07,279
to

377
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:10,079
uh

378
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:13,040
there would be actually formula yeah so

379
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,320
uh

380
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,880
the um so yeah my name is tom miller i'm

381
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:19,040
the managing director of the

382
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:20,639
security company in australia called

383
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:23,120
threat intelligence so um

384
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,880
basically uh i've been involved with

385
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:27,760
blackout for a long time uh been

386
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:30,079
training at blackout for this year will

387
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:33,440
be the 11th year um in a row which is

388
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,880
fantastic

389
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:36,959
and um yeah obviously on the review

390
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:38,399
board and

391
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:40,079
really enjoy it gives us a lot of

392
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:42,720
insights into uh some very cool research

393
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:45,440
especially you know all of the uh great

394
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,040
ones that didn't actually make it

395
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:50,160
through um we had a tough time arguing

396
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:52,160
amongst ourselves to get those

397
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:54,639
get those through but uh i'd say that's

398
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:57,920
um you know i think i really enjoyed the

399
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:00,480
sql injection one but um

400
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:03,199
my pick today was the unprotected

401
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:07,199
broadcasts in android 9 and 10

402
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:10,000
and actually in the android 11 preview

403
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,199
which got

404
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:13,519
fixed before 11 came out

405
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:15,120
and uh yeah

406
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17,680
that one just sort of shows um

407
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:19,279
you know just some of the bugs that can

408
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:21,680
be introduced into things like mobile

409
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,440
devices that

410
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:27,839
where it was around associated with um

411
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:28,560
the

412
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:31,680
privileged uh broadcast of intents so

413
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:34,480
basically uh communications between apps

414
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:37,199
and in the system and uh

415
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:39,360
you know demonstrated that

416
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:41,120
ultimately um

417
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:43,680
unauthorized applications so that

418
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:46,240
there's trusted applications and there's

419
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:48,160
untrusted apps which you basically pull

420
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,920
down from the marketplace

421
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:51,199
as opposed to the ones that are

422
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:54,240
pre-built into the into the phone itself

423
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,040
um

424
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:56,399
yeah and basically show that

425
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:59,680
unauthorized apps could send uh

426
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:02,639
broadcast intent messages to

427
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:05,040
uh other other apps that are privileged

428
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:07,040
on the on the device

429
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:08,720
and um

430
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:09,680
and

431
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:12,800
they were actually taken as trusted

432
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,800
messages um

433
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,560
either from the system or from from

434
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:19,440
trusted apps and they could actually

435
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,920
trigger arbitrary command execution in

436
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:24,800
some of these to get system privilege

437
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,000
access

438
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:26,880
um

439
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:29,040
access to long files access to

440
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:32,160
personally identifiable information

441
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,720
so some of the examples that were given

442
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:37,440
which were really interesting was on the

443
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:40,240
google pixel three and four uh one of

444
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:42,160
the apps had uh

445
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:44,000
phone access um so that was the

446
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,680
privileges that they had

447
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:48,560
and a third-party app that from you know

448
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:50,639
you just install from the app store

449
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:53,279
could send in some messages causing file

450
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:55,920
corruption and actually overwrite all of

451
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,680
your phone contacts

452
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:59,600
um and then there were some more

453
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:02,320
malicious ones uh where one of the third

454
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,368
party apps

455
00:17:04,368 --> 00:17:06,240
[Music]

456
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:08,559
or one of the apps that's pre-installed

457
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:10,319
was perf dump

458
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:11,280
which

459
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:14,640
any third-party app could actually send

460
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:17,520
a message to and trigger arbitrary

461
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:19,280
command execution

462
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:21,919
and you know ultimately just get full

463
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:25,039
system access on your device

464
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:27,679
and um you know do things like recording

465
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:30,080
screens or modify your keyboard to the

466
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,520
key logger and

467
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:32,720
those sort of things and there was

468
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,559
another one

469
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:37,679
which was the qami app that had system

470
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:38,960
access

471
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:41,520
um and

472
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,600
you know it

473
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,760
any third-party app could basically send

474
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,840
messages to get access to things like

475
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:49,200
your

476
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,720
the imei

477
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,640
number your wi-fi mac address your

478
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:55,360
bluetooth mac address the serial number

479
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:56,640
just a whole

480
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,880
whole host of problems were just

481
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,720
introduced uh

482
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:03,760
through this um this vulnerability and

483
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,679
uh that was just really impressive

484
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:07,039
there's um

485
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:08,880
just is just

486
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,480
you know some of these vulnerabilities

487
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:13,520
just demonstrate the fundamental flaws

488
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:14,720
that we've got in

489
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,960
technology these things

490
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:18,080
um

491
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:21,679
but yeah that was that was my tip um

492
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:23,200
so uh

493
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,880
on that note um

494
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:27,200
you know a fundamental

495
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,280
flaws in technology i mean nikki you

496
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:30,960
mentioned about

497
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:34,400
the the tesla sort of talk and

498
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,080
self-driving cars

499
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:39,039
sort of scare me um just because my

500
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:41,039
entire business and

501
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:42,799
pretty much a lot of this conference is

502
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:44,720
based on the fact that

503
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,240
you know bugs

504
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:48,160
exist and we see them

505
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,480
all the time and it scares me that you

506
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:52,400
know we can we can trust things like

507
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,160
self-driving cars to

508
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:57,360
take us around um when we can't even fix

509
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:00,240
up things like cross-site scripting

510
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,200
so

511
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,520
um you know i sort of there was a few

512
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:04,960
things that happened today that just

513
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,000
sort of

514
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,679
made me laugh where

515
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:10,720
you know um i was watching my

516
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,720
pretty much fight about to eat in

517
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,640
between sessions and i

518
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:17,840
saw my pool right my pool robot

519
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:20,640
start eating my kids pool toys

520
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,240
um you know it's automatically going

521
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:24,559
around and obviously not as

522
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:26,799
intelligent as a self-driving car but

523
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:28,640
you know it's sort of working its way

524
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,720
around my pool started eating my kids

525
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:31,919
pool toys

526
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:34,400
and got one of them stuck and it starts

527
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,559
spinning in circles going backwards and

528
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:37,679
forth

529
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:39,600
it just made me think of self-driving

530
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:40,880
cars

531
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:43,039
is that is that your future self-driving

532
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:45,760
car is the is the pool toy

533
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,440
yeah well

534
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:49,919
someone else has been programmed to go

535
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:53,120
catch it

536
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:54,400
it's just like

537
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:55,919
you know

538
00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:57,679
like are they taking into account things

539
00:19:57,679 --> 00:19:59,039
like you know if my

540
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:01,039
kids toys get stuck in a piece of the

541
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:03,120
car you know how is that how does the

542
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:04,960
software handle that

543
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,960
this sounds like this guy skynet might

544
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:09,200
get started right

545
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:11,760
cell driving hard actually scaring me i

546
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:14,640
did programming of uh

547
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:17,120
robotic devices in university like where

548
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:19,360
you take input from sensors and you try

549
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:20,880
to make decisions how your robotic

550
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:23,120
device is going to move and that was so

551
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:25,120
difficult to get your device from point

552
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:26,799
a to point b so

553
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:29,200
i can't even imagine how much processing

554
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,679
is on self driving car like it it does

555
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:32,960
scare me like

556
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,720
a single fault you're basically off the

557
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,880
road yeah

558
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:39,360
yeah absolutely yeah and and the other

559
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:41,919
thing when you look at it um

560
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:44,480
from the vulnerability perspective even

561
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:47,039
not just the logic perspective you look

562
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:49,120
at some of the talks that we saw today

563
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:51,200
there was there was the one which was um

564
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:54,400
the cost of complexity which was

565
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:58,080
rfcs being ambiguous around how

566
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:59,760
technology should be

567
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:01,679
developed and then you've got developers

568
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:04,000
who introduce the bugs anyway but

569
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,280
they

570
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:07,360
you know they read these rfcs to

571
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:10,640
implement like fundamental parts of

572
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,480
you you know how everything works like

573
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:13,280
you're

574
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:16,640
either a kernel or your tcpip stack so

575
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:17,840
in this case

576
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:19,679
um in this particular presentation it

577
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:22,640
was uh analyzing like the

578
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:25,679
yeah tsvip stacks within uh seven

579
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:28,080
different implementations and fifty

580
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:30,720
percent of them were vulnerable and uh

581
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,400
you know demonstrated a whole bunch of

582
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:36,000
vulnerable dns clients um that in theory

583
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:36,960
were

584
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:39,039
uh could potentially be up to i think it

585
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:41,200
was 10 billion effective devices but

586
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,799
they said even if i think it was one

587
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:44,320
percent of those would be a hundred

588
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,280
million

589
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:47,600
um you know it could be uh have remote

590
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:50,000
load execution vulnerabilities in them

591
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,840
um you know i think there was another

592
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:53,919
talk around some of the pamela you

593
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:55,919
mentioned to me offline about some of

594
00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:59,120
the colonel uh vulnerabilities

595
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:01,280
and the fact that these

596
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:02,960
still exist

597
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,640
you know within systems when you look at

598
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:06,880
things like self-driving cars and their

599
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,480
internet connected and all this sort of

600
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:09,760
stuff just

601
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:11,840
how you know you look at the uh the

602
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:14,000
mobile broadcasting you know how

603
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,039
potentially you know a broadcast could

604
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:18,159
take down

605
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:22,159
you know every every car on the road

606
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:23,200
yeah and

607
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,720
ty you mentioned you know the kernel

608
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,880
talk and i another talk i really enjoyed

609
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:29,039
at the start of the day was the um

610
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:31,200
racing the dark and time of check time

611
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:34,000
of use bugs and you know it was a very

612
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,559
good story of bugs across all three

613
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:39,760
kernels from windows mac and linux and

614
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:41,520
something really struck me you know it's

615
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:43,760
2021 and we're still talking about some

616
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:45,679
very basic books in

617
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:47,600
unsafe memory languages like c which is

618
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,600
everywhere because it's you know in

619
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,440
libraries and sometimes you might hack a

620
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:52,799
web app and you don't know it's being

621
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:54,400
passed to a c library so

622
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,400
we still have these terrible languages

623
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,799
everywhere but it really struck me with

624
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:00,080
you know

625
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:01,919
markdown's wonderful book the art of

626
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:03,679
software security assessment right which

627
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:06,159
is this big and full of amazing books

628
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:08,640
and it's still very relevant today and

629
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,400
it's still coming up when a lot of the

630
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,480
the top blackout research and i found

631
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:15,200
that very interesting uh we're in 2021

632
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:17,039
and we're still hearing these and they

633
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:18,799
all and they um

634
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:20,720
you know you wang who who spoke about

635
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:21,919
that he

636
00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:24,159
he's had some very good quotes and with

637
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:26,000
the time of check time abuse books that

638
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
he had found he he had some good

639
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,679
takeaways and he said all inputs are

640
00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:31,840
potentially harmful and yes that's true

641
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:33,280
right and you know just depends what you

642
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:35,520
do with them and he also had a brilliant

643
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:37,760
um takeaway with security updates don't

644
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:39,919
always fix everything and a lot of he he

645
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:41,039
he's ended

646
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:43,200
the talk with a smile where he goes you

647
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,159
know

648
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:46,080
apple have just patched my book and they

649
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:48,400
emailed me on monday asking if i can

650
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,240
check the patch in beta before it goes

651
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:52,320
to prada he's just smiling going i hope

652
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,320
the patch fixed it and he's a knowing

653
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:56,559
smile so i just thought it was great

654
00:23:56,559 --> 00:23:59,200
he's well able to take patches apart and

655
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:01,360
just not assume they fixed his report as

656
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:02,640
well

657
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:04,320
and just keep the research going it's

658
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:06,000
wonderful

659
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,520
yeah awesome

660
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:09,919
that brings up another talk that kind of

661
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:11,840
goes on the the

662
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:14,080
you know microsoft is classic and it

663
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:16,320
operates in kind of the same way and has

664
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:18,480
just evolved and added and

665
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,000
hatched here and there

666
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,320
um the gentleman that spoke about threat

667
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:24,320
hunting and active directory

668
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:26,080
kind of reinforced the fact that we're

669
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:27,600
looking at the same methods of

670
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:30,000
persistence over time

671
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,919
you know it's still trying to get

672
00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:34,880
scheduled tasks recycling tokens

673
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:36,159
um

674
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:38,640
you know moving laterally and and

675
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:41,520
establishing footholds it's

676
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:44,000
it is good to to remind yourself that

677
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,919
these these systems haven't evolved too

678
00:24:45,919 --> 00:24:46,960
much

679
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:48,799
in the way that they operate at a core

680
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:52,159
level so i thought that talk really re

681
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:53,919
recapped all of the places you need to

682
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:56,080
look for threat hunting

683
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:58,000
um and how to weed out some of those

684
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
more persistent threats that that you

685
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,400
might not see as noisy

686
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,760
on the outside

687
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:05,440
but they do require file system

688
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:07,919
forensics or or you know

689
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:09,760
at least some sort of scan across the

690
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:11,919
environment to see if that actual

691
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:14,080
structure has been tampered with so i

692
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:15,679
thought that talk really summed that up

693
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:16,799
well

694
00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:19,520
yeah well it's a it's a good uh it was a

695
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:22,159
good insight into you know

696
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:24,559
one just a recap but also

697
00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:26,400
some of the industry

698
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,640
trends and things like that as well it

699
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:31,520
sort of revamps uh some of those talks

700
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:32,480
um

701
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:35,200
you know all those topics uh theodore

702
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:38,000
did you have any thoughts on sort of

703
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:43,799
some of the industry trends that you see

704
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:50,400
yeah

705
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:53,760
there is another talk that i think

706
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,360
was kind of interesting mining and

707
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:57,200
exploiting mobile payment credential

708
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:58,720
links and noaa

709
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:01,360
we just talked about the issues that

710
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:02,240
been

711
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:04,640
around for ages and they still there if

712
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:06,880
we look at the state of modern android

713
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:10,240
applications we just download like uh

714
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:12,640
200 apps probably half of them is going

715
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:13,679
to have like

716
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:17,679
uh credentials api keys uh api and voice

717
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:21,360
like secret passwords in them so uh well

718
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:23,760
the talk itself is presented more like

719
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:26,000
as an academic kind of dry

720
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,559
talk but the impact is a significant

721
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:29,919
first of all

722
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:30,880
uh

723
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:33,200
it's coming from a university in hong

724
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:36,159
kong so they mostly focused on payment

725
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:38,799
apps that are popular here in asia and

726
00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:42,400
they don't talk openly what apps uh i

727
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,400
impacted but you could probably guess if

728
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,640
you're familiar with the what's

729
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:49,360
what's popular and the impact is is

730
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:51,840
crazy like if even if like those apps

731
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:52,960
that have like

732
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:56,159
uh millions of users like in china have

733
00:26:56,159 --> 00:26:58,720
that kind of issues

734
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:00,880
yeah the state the state of android of

735
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:02,960
motor android apps is

736
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:05,520
not even close to be like perfect so

737
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:06,880
that that would be like another

738
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,960
interesting call that like i definitely

739
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:12,400
would uh point out

740
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:17,039
excellent sounds good the um the

741
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:19,039
some of the other things that uh i've

742
00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:20,799
personally been seeing in the industry

743
00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:23,679
and i know that uh some of you guys have

744
00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:26,399
uh recently is you know obviously around

745
00:27:26,399 --> 00:27:27,600
things like

746
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:30,159
ransomware and the massive increase in

747
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:31,840
security breaches

748
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:33,919
you know what are you guys seeing in

749
00:27:33,919 --> 00:27:36,559
that space

750
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:40,559
i mean we have a lot of ransomware cases

751
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:41,279
and

752
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:43,600
we see similar variants we've gotten

753
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:45,200
better at negotiating with certain

754
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:46,720
threat actors

755
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:49,039
and others you know we kind of peg them

756
00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:51,440
against a dollar amount

757
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:53,919
what is their usual asking price and how

758
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:56,880
low can you negotiate that ransom down

759
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:59,360
before they accept it or not so we've

760
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:01,600
you know it's becoming so prevalent that

761
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:03,679
we have databases of this stuff that

762
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:06,159
were that we're trying to become better

763
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:08,960
investigators and and ransom negotiators

764
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:10,240
against

765
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:11,120
um

766
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:12,799
but at the same time

767
00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:14,640
you know the effort

768
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:17,279
that threat actors are putting out

769
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:19,200
i think is decreasing a bit i think

770
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:21,520
they're much more organized they have

771
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:24,320
you know tactics strategies playbooks

772
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:25,919
but the amount of time they're investing

773
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:28,080
per attack is decreased because they're

774
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:30,880
trying to just maximize profit

775
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:32,799
similar to any other industry i think

776
00:28:32,799 --> 00:28:35,919
organized ransomware is competitive now

777
00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:37,440
so you have

778
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:39,360
different groups who are

779
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:40,320
who are

780
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,799
running the same deal so you see a bit

781
00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:44,320
less

782
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:46,960
you see a bit more data exfiltration and

783
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:50,000
you know the threat of publishing

784
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,200
that data

785
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:53,679
and i see a little less you know

786
00:28:53,679 --> 00:28:56,159
smash and grab destructive type

787
00:28:56,159 --> 00:28:59,039
ransomware like several systems can be

788
00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:01,120
restored at the end of it

789
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:02,399
um

790
00:29:02,399 --> 00:29:04,720
it's that threat of publication what are

791
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:07,200
you guys seeing

792
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:10,640
so my take on ransomware is that

793
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:11,760
the world

794
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:14,240
many criminal groups operating out of

795
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:17,120
like eastern europe and other

796
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:19,360
regions but since i'm being russian i'm

797
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:20,960
more familiar with what's going on out

798
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:22,480
of eastern europe

799
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:25,840
and uh ransomware is the type of crime

800
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:26,720
that

801
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:30,000
has much less risk of being caught while

802
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,200
it generates significant profits think

803
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:35,279
of it in the past uh

804
00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:37,919
if you break into a bank account and you

805
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:40,320
steal money and then you wear money to

806
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:42,480
your own bank account or to your money

807
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:45,760
mood bank account there is still a money

808
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:48,399
line that basically could lead to the

809
00:29:48,399 --> 00:29:51,039
capture of you as a criminal while if

810
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:53,360
you're doing ransomware you get paid you

811
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:56,640
you break uh into into a network you get

812
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:59,520
paid in bitcoins it's perfect anonymity

813
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:03,600
so it's very low uh risk level crime

814
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:07,279
that just uh gives you a lot of money

815
00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:09,279
and uh

816
00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:11,360
the insurance systems

817
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:13,279
uh where like many companies can

818
00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:14,799
actually claim

819
00:30:14,799 --> 00:30:17,360
uh the money that they paid to to uh the

820
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:19,440
ransomware criminals as a part of their

821
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:22,559
like insurance package is simply make it

822
00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:25,120
even worse like many companies not even

823
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:26,960
willing to spend effort in protecting

824
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:28,960
the network because they buy insurance

825
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:31,919
so if they get broken into insurance

826
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:34,320
space and that benefits everyone except

827
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:35,760
for

828
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:37,679
maybe poor system administrators who

829
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:39,520
have to fix the whole thing and the

830
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:41,840
ransomware thread actors they just like

831
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,520
they went from the high profile like

832
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:46,320
company like business operations to like

833
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:48,080
pop and mom kind of ransomware shops

834
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:50,159
where they just use 7-zip to pack your

835
00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:52,480
files and leave your text file

836
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:54,640
asking for money

837
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:58,559
yeah well that was the recent q locker

838
00:30:58,559 --> 00:31:01,679
attacking the qnaps right

839
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:04,240
yeah that is

840
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:06,880
yeah it's it's a shell script and if you

841
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:08,960
do ps you could actually see a password

842
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:11,200
if you're lucky enough to catch them in

843
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,799
the process you can you can actually see

844
00:31:12,799 --> 00:31:14,480
a password they're using inside the

845
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:16,880
screen so

846
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:18,640
yeah crazy

847
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:21,120
yeah and that comes down to what

848
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:23,600
mika was saying about how

849
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:26,480
you know the uh the actual effort going

850
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:27,519
into them

851
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:30,320
uh is going down in some cases

852
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:32,399
and you know i've seen the same sort of

853
00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:33,600
thing we had the

854
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:36,240
last year we had the australian national

855
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:38,240
cyber attacks going on

856
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:40,559
and they were dubbed the copy and paste

857
00:31:40,559 --> 00:31:41,679
attacks

858
00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:43,840
um because as they were

859
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:46,240
you know these as you say 100 agree with

860
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:47,519
you they were

861
00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:50,640
far from sophisticated um but they were

862
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:52,880
very organized you know so they would

863
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:54,320
get in and they would move through the

864
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:56,799
network relatively quickly

865
00:31:56,799 --> 00:31:58,720
but they were using all open source

866
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:01,279
tools you know just straight from github

867
00:32:01,279 --> 00:32:04,320
or wherever um down to the point where

868
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:06,880
you know they were using the telerik uh

869
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:09,760
exploit to break into some some windows

870
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:10,799
systems

871
00:32:10,799 --> 00:32:11,760
um

872
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:13,039
and

873
00:32:13,039 --> 00:32:15,360
you know like that that creates some

874
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:16,960
temporary dlls and those sort of things

875
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:19,039
and they didn't even change the names of

876
00:32:19,039 --> 00:32:20,000
like the

877
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:23,360
dolls to try and bypass anything they

878
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:25,440
just they didn't care they just went

879
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:27,279
straight in and sort of broke in and

880
00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:30,320
just yeah living of the land and

881
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:32,559
there is one reason why like as a

882
00:32:32,559 --> 00:32:34,559
criminal why you would like to use the

883
00:32:34,559 --> 00:32:37,120
open source and off shelf tools via

884
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:38,960
building your own because it makes

885
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:40,960
attribution very hard like even if you

886
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,880
get arrested there is no proof that a

887
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:45,039
particular case was behind you because

888
00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:46,559
everyone is using those open source

889
00:32:46,559 --> 00:32:48,799
tools right so

890
00:32:48,799 --> 00:32:51,519
that's that's the thing and they uh from

891
00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:54,320
what i've seen they even pay software

892
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:56,720
licenses for offensive tools so they

893
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:59,039
like from the software usage perspective

894
00:32:59,039 --> 00:33:00,399
they're not even creating software

895
00:33:00,399 --> 00:33:01,760
they're using like

896
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:05,600
uh licensed uh uh cobble strike and like

897
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:07,440
all of those tools yeah

898
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:11,720
ps they have money for them

899
00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:14,799
because they don't often pay for the

900
00:33:14,799 --> 00:33:16,640
license either so

901
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:17,840
you know

902
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:19,600
it's a fantastic tool and it just proves

903
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:21,519
how good it is when the bad people are

904
00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:23,200
using it too

905
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,240
yeah

906
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:26,320
yeah there's a huge amount of seriously

907
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:27,360
using it

908
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:28,399
um

909
00:33:28,399 --> 00:33:31,840
one of the one of the things that uh

910
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:33,679
you brought up was around sort of

911
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:35,840
extortion um

912
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:37,679
what do you like

913
00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:39,600
when i've sort of what we've sort of

914
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:42,080
seen and exactly what you've said

915
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:43,440
is around

916
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:45,919
uh you know an increase in in ransomware

917
00:33:45,919 --> 00:33:48,039
but we've seen it shift more to

918
00:33:48,039 --> 00:33:51,039
infiltrations and then mascara

919
00:33:51,039 --> 00:33:54,399
uh encryption of entire organizations

920
00:33:54,399 --> 00:33:57,120
um you know multinational organizations

921
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:58,960
that just shut the entire business down

922
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:00,960
in an instant

923
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:03,360
but then it's also then moving into

924
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:04,799
extortion

925
00:34:04,799 --> 00:34:06,480
and ransomware and getting that

926
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:08,719
combination of stealing the data stored

927
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:09,679
in you

928
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:11,918
i just i find it

929
00:34:11,918 --> 00:34:13,918
a little bit interesting to see like

930
00:34:13,918 --> 00:34:15,359
when when you get

931
00:34:15,359 --> 00:34:16,320
uh

932
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:17,599
ransomware

933
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:20,399
and not being extorted and i'm keen to

934
00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:21,679
hear your

935
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:24,239
thoughts maker on this um

936
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:26,639
i just there's i think there's a balance

937
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:29,280
between the sweet spot for an attacker

938
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:31,359
from a return on investment or the

939
00:34:31,359 --> 00:34:35,119
likelihood of someone paying the ransom

940
00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:36,000
um

941
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,599
where you know if you just get

942
00:34:37,599 --> 00:34:38,800
ransomware

943
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:40,000
and

944
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,599
you know you have to pay a ransom to get

945
00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:44,480
your files back right um it's pretty

946
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:45,199
good

947
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:47,679
like if you're in a corner and you don't

948
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:49,520
have your backups and we had a client

949
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:51,679
with that where their right guy turned

950
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:53,520
around and said hey i forgot to tell you

951
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:55,119
that your backups haven't been working

952
00:34:55,119 --> 00:34:56,719
for six months

953
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:59,119
and uh that basically that put them in a

954
00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:01,119
position where they had no choice but to

955
00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:02,720
to pay

956
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:04,240
um

957
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:06,400
you know there's a pretty good chance

958
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:08,240
you're going to get a good majority of

959
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:10,160
your files back and

960
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:13,040
if you pay it so i think that's that's

961
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:15,760
to me is the sweet spot of

962
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:17,359
you know from a from the attacker's

963
00:35:17,359 --> 00:35:19,760
perspective of getting revenue

964
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:21,920
when they steal the data

965
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:23,359
and well it's

966
00:35:23,359 --> 00:35:24,960
yeah they're threatening to release it

967
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:27,520
or i mean we even had one recently where

968
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:29,200
every day they linked the data to

969
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:31,200
another client and another client and

970
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:33,200
another client until they

971
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:35,440
um you know we're going to pay i just

972
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:37,599
think at that point

973
00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:40,640
you know one they've destroyed any

974
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:42,720
trust i mean it's funny with ransomware

975
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:44,400
you sort of have a level of trust that

976
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:45,920
you're gonna get the decryption key

977
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:46,800
right

978
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:49,200
um when you're dealing with extortion i

979
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:50,640
just find it really

980
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:52,640
difficult that you could pay unless

981
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:53,839
you're really

982
00:35:53,839 --> 00:35:55,359
in a corner

983
00:35:55,359 --> 00:35:57,359
because at that point in your loss

984
00:35:57,359 --> 00:36:00,079
i'm keen to hear your thoughts on on

985
00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:01,839
that especially as you were talking

986
00:36:01,839 --> 00:36:04,400
about negotiating uh with the threat

987
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:06,880
actors and negotiating them down

988
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:08,880
and how you how do you actually approach

989
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:11,119
those negotiations and your thoughts on

990
00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:13,599
sort of that sweet spot of

991
00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:16,960
return on investment through tackles

992
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:18,960
um well there is that great book that's

993
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:21,760
never split the difference um it's about

994
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:23,760
hostage negotiations and a lot of the

995
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:26,400
same tactics apply where you try to put

996
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:28,960
as much time in between

997
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:30,720
that initial ask

998
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:33,040
and any type of action on your end

999
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:34,560
because you're buying time for the

1000
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:36,480
client to see what is the status of the

1001
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:38,960
backup how much data can they get back

1002
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:41,119
and what's absolutely critical to move

1003
00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:42,160
forward

1004
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:44,400
um so the first thing you want to do is

1005
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:46,960
just buy time and like you said

1006
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:49,359
ty hopefully they're backing up and have

1007
00:36:49,359 --> 00:36:52,720
something decent to restore

1008
00:36:52,839 --> 00:36:55,599
um the

1009
00:36:55,599 --> 00:36:57,040
in terms of if they've if they've

1010
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:59,200
exfiltrated data and have kind of shown

1011
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:01,119
you um

1012
00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:04,240
at least snippets or or can prove that

1013
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:06,480
they've leaked it i never think that you

1014
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:08,560
can trust them not to publish it i

1015
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:11,040
forget who exactly

1016
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:11,920
yeah

1017
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:14,400
um so if it's more so about your

1018
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:17,040
critical data being lost and it you know

1019
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:19,200
impacting business hugely

1020
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:21,680
then you might actually need to consider

1021
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:23,119
negotiation

1022
00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:25,839
um and then you have the proof of life

1023
00:37:25,839 --> 00:37:27,760
period where you're finding files that

1024
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:29,520
you need them to prove that the

1025
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:31,359
decryption key works

1026
00:37:31,359 --> 00:37:33,440
uh it's a long drawn out process and it

1027
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:34,960
can actually take longer than you'd

1028
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:37,680
think it's not simple and then once you

1029
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:39,520
might get the key it takes

1030
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:41,839
weeks uh yeah it depends on how many

1031
00:37:41,839 --> 00:37:44,320
systems that you need to

1032
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:47,520
restore i think it's it's best to deal

1033
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:48,480
with it

1034
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:50,160
um

1035
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:51,520
you know

1036
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:53,920
theater i know you're not pro uh

1037
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:56,960
insurance but they do run checks against

1038
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:59,599
your security before writing a policy

1039
00:37:59,599 --> 00:38:01,200
and it is complicated they have these

1040
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:03,599
formulas for how to underwrite certain

1041
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:04,880
risks

1042
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:07,119
and we kind of step in and just you know

1043
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:09,280
as responders who work with insurers

1044
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:12,400
kind of say oh exposed rdp

1045
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:14,400
i would uh i would maybe ask them to

1046
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:16,240
patch that before uh

1047
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:19,200
signing a ransomware policy

1048
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:21,200
um but it's it's really interesting and

1049
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:23,200
i think it'll continue to evolve

1050
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:25,599
um they're trying to you know attackers

1051
00:38:25,599 --> 00:38:27,119
are trying to pressure

1052
00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:29,599
the uh the victim to pay as quickly as

1053
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:31,440
possible and the best thing you can do

1054
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:33,359
is put as much time as possible in

1055
00:38:33,359 --> 00:38:34,480
between

1056
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:37,680
actions and and conversations

1057
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:39,040
yeah excellent

1058
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:41,359
yeah i think uh it's interesting that

1059
00:38:41,359 --> 00:38:43,680
you say that

1060
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:46,000
you know if they're showing proof of

1061
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:49,839
data then you can't trust them to to

1062
00:38:49,839 --> 00:38:51,680
you know not release it

1063
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:53,839
uh i know that in your presentation you

1064
00:38:53,839 --> 00:38:56,320
you know it's talking about researchers

1065
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:58,320
and the risk to them

1066
00:38:58,320 --> 00:38:59,359
uh

1067
00:38:59,359 --> 00:39:00,800
you know some of the investigations

1068
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:02,320
we've done you know the research

1069
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:04,960
researchers quite often show the data

1070
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:06,160
and

1071
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:07,040
you know

1072
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:09,839
at that point the client's like well

1073
00:39:09,839 --> 00:39:12,640
i can't trust this guy because he just

1074
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:15,200
showed me my own data right

1075
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:17,040
so it's a really difficult

1076
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:18,880
position which is what you were sort of

1077
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:20,880
talking about in in your presentation

1078
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:22,800
today and uh

1079
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:25,040
you know

1080
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:28,160
troy hunt finds his own data in the

1081
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:31,118
leaks that he gets

1082
00:39:31,599 --> 00:39:34,079
yeah exactly and you know he mentioned

1083
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:35,760
with the

1084
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:36,640
the

1085
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:38,400
example where he showed his daughter's

1086
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:40,720
watch getting hacked and

1087
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:43,760
releasing the or getting you know random

1088
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:45,760
phone calls through it by arbitrary

1089
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:48,960
people uh how you know in releasing that

1090
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:52,640
to and working with the uh vendor to

1091
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:53,760
you know

1092
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:55,520
sort of disclose that to him he just

1093
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:58,320
found that was quite risky as well

1094
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:01,760
and um yeah there's a lot of

1095
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:03,920
concern in that space

1096
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:05,440
um

1097
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:10,960
so one last question uh just from um

1098
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:12,480
from the chat so

1099
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:14,640
should the ransomware victims actually

1100
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:18,160
pay ransom and then we'll wrap up

1101
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:20,240
depends on what your objective is like

1102
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:22,640
if you

1103
00:40:23,119 --> 00:40:25,839
if you really want your files back

1104
00:40:25,839 --> 00:40:27,680
yes but you basically

1105
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:29,520
uh you funeraling money into the

1106
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:32,000
criminal economy the whole i think the

1107
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:35,040
whole the reason why ransomware ops

1108
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:37,200
are so rampant is because people pay if

1109
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:39,119
no one pays for the reason there would

1110
00:40:39,119 --> 00:40:40,319
be

1111
00:40:40,319 --> 00:40:42,400
there would be no no no business of

1112
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:44,880
ransomware

1113
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:46,960
yeah awesome

1114
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:48,960
okay well uh i think that's

1115
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:51,440
all the time we've got for today

1116
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:54,079
um that's a really good overview and

1117
00:40:54,079 --> 00:40:56,319
really good insights from their review

1118
00:40:56,319 --> 00:40:58,720
board so thank you very much

1119
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:01,359
um thank you to all the delegates who

1120
00:41:01,359 --> 00:41:04,640
attended black app today as well as all

1121
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:07,119
the speakers for all of the research

1122
00:41:07,119 --> 00:41:08,400
that they did and the great

1123
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:10,880
presentations that they delivered it's

1124
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:13,119
been a really good first day of blackout

1125

asia 2021 and uh look forward to the

1126
