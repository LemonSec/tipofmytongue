00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:18,240
hello everyone my name is huang yung

3
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:20,960
i'm a graduate student from distributed

4
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:22,960
and invented system lab of landfill

5
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:24,480
university

6
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:26,800
and it's great pleasure for me to be a

7
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:29,199
co-presenter to share our research with

8
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:31,760
you today the topic we want to talk

9
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:34,719
about is disappeared course still hash

10
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:38,079
rate in strength and securely

11
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:40,879
our presentation will be divided into

12
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:43,120
four parts and i'll introduce the first

13
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:45,600
two parts there are mining and poor and

14
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,280
australian protocol

15
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,079
and the main speaker will introduce

16
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:52,800
how to steer hash rate in stratum and

17
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:56,239
approval concept later

18
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:59,039
with the increase of the number of

19
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:01,280
miners and the improvement of the whole

20
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:03,520
computing power of blockchain

21
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:05,920
it is more more difficult for a single

22
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:09,119
independent miner to step in minor block

23
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:11,040
to obtain revenue

24
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,200
so many miners combine their computing

25
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,840
power in the form of cooperative mining

26
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,880
to establish a mining pool

27
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:21,759
the mining pool will assign jobs

28
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:25,040
to the miner who joins joins it

29
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:26,799
according to the computing ability of

30
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:29,520
miners each miner is assigned a shared

31
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:32,880
target with a different difficulty

32
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:35,520
after completing the jobs each miner who

33
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:38,079
joins the mining pool can get perfect

34
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:39,680
according to the contribution to the

35
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,600
mining pool

36
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:44,000
there are many settlement strategies

37
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,560
such as papers lesson shelves paper

38
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:49,040
shells paper shells plus and four paper

39
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:51,439
shells

40
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:54,479
here i will take bitcoin as an example

41
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:56,320
to explain how

42
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:59,919
what proof of work is

43
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:01,759
a reminder try to figure out the

44
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:04,079
solution of the bitcoin puzzle if

45
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:06,079
someone finds out a solution

46
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:08,000
the block he might will be the next

47
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,239
block in the blockchain after other

48
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:12,400
participants verify that his block is

49
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,879
valid

50
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,599
before generating a block all

51
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:20,000
transactions need to be verified whether

52
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,840
they are valid by

53
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:24,000
then the value transactions are packaged

54
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,920
into a block

55
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,000
and the new block is generated through

56
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,760
proof of work and added to the

57
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:32,480
blockchain

58
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:35,680
each block will collect a set of

59
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:39,040
pending transactions in block in the

60
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:41,680
coin network

61
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:44,319
but the first transaction in each block

62
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:48,239
is special called coinbase transaction

63
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:50,400
it is used to specify that

64
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,480
when the current block is mined through

65
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,959
approval work the miner will receive the

66
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:57,280
current corresponding block reward and

67
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,599
fees

68
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:02,640
the figure here illustrates the

69
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:05,519
structure of the coinbase transaction

70
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:07,360
from this figure we can see that the

71
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,200
coinbase transaction

72
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,680
can be divided into four parts

73
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:14,319
there are coinbase one astronauts one

74
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:16,720
external two and coinbase two

75
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,720
external one covers the first five

76
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:21,040
fields of the coin transactions

77
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:24,080
and part of script

78
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,239
the external one covers a small part of

79
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:28,720
script in the coinbase transaction

80
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:31,280
it is specified by the mining pool and

81
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,599
is unique for each connection between

82
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:37,040
the mining pool and mining machine

83
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:40,080
the external stew covers a small part of

84
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:43,680
script immediately after external one

85
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:46,239
when miners of bitcoin puzzle with

86
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:47,920
approval work

87
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:50,159
if the nasa is exhausted

88
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:52,720
external stew will be incremented to

89
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:55,200
figure out the puzzle

90
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,680
and then coinbase 2 covers the rest of

91
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:01,200
the coinbase transactions

92
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,799
now i will introduce

93
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:05,360
the stratum protocol

94
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,360
the communication between miners and

95
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,760
mining pool needs to follow mining

96
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:12,720
protocols such as stratum protocol get

97
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:15,280
block template protocol and get a work

98
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,639
protocol

99
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:18,560
we focused on the strating protocol

100
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,560
because it is widely used

101
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:23,120
and brands performed an upgraded version

102
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:26,880
at the end of 2019

103
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:30,240
called australian version two

104
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:33,040
stratum protocol is based on tcp plain

105
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,680
text transmission protocol using json

106
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:38,960
rpc data format

107
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,680
from the table here we can see that only

108
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:44,400
massage pro supports stratum version 2

109
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,960
among the mining pros with top community

110
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,080
power

111
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:50,320
so the australian version 2 has not yet

112
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:52,160
been widely used and we don't have the

113
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,479
corresponding mining machine which is

114
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:57,759
supported stratum version 2

115
00:04:57,759 --> 00:04:58,880
and

116
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,160
mainstream

117
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,400
mining machine and

118
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,680
mining software currently do not support

119
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,199
stratum version 2.

120
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:08,000
so

121
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,240
our attack schemes are only aimed at

122
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,479
australian version 1.

123
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:14,400
next i will introduce the communication

124
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:18,560
process of stratum version 1 in detail

125
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:23,120
first miner initiates a subscription

126
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,800
requested to the mining pool to

127
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,880
establish a connection through the

128
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:29,600
mining subscribe method

129
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,720
this method needs to permit parameters

130
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:35,600
the first one is user agent and the

131
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,800
second one

132
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:40,320
is an optional parameter that represents

133
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,720
the the extraneous one that might not

134
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:45,199
want to continue to use

135
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:47,360
after receiving the above subscription

136
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,759
mesh message

137
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:51,840
the mining pool will return the

138
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:54,400
subscription id

139
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,880
external one and the action numbers to

140
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:59,199
size

141
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:03,120
after that miners use mining authorized

142
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,280
method to send an authorization request

143
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,199
to the mining pool

144
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:10,160
this method needs two parameters there

145
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,080
are username and

146
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:15,840
password of the miner

147
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,919
and then mining for returns true or

148
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:20,160
false to notify minor while the

149
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:23,919
authorization is successful

150
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,759
after that

151
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:28,160
the minor will use mining

152
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:32,319
set mining external subscribe method to

153
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:34,800
inform the mining pool that expose the

154
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:38,479
mining stations method

155
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,240
after successful subscription and

156
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,960
authorization the poor will negotiate

157
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:48,000
the difficulty value with miner through

158
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,800
mining static difficulty method

159
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,960
the difficulty needs to be compatible

160
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,880
with the computing power of mining

161
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,479
machine

162
00:06:56,479 --> 00:06:58,560
and then mining pool assigns jobs to

163
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:03,360
miner the remaining notify method

164
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,280
the mining notify message contains

165
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,639
several fields

166
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:09,360
such as the id number of job

167
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,599
hash of previous block

168
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:14,560
coinbase one coinbase two lists of

169
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,840
miracle branches bitcoin block version

170
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,919
on the encoded bitcoin network

171
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:22,639
difficulty and the current time

172
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:25,120
and the last bill of the mining notify

173
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:28,240
message is named clean jobs

174
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,080
its type is bullying

175
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:32,960
if true it means that the miner needs to

176
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:35,039
stop the current work and execute this

177
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:37,520
new work

178
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:40,639
when minor finds out the result that

179
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:42,720
matches the difficulty then mining pool

180
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:43,520
set

181
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:46,560
miner use money submit method to submit

182
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:50,160
the result which could share

183
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,960
and my new submit method will send job

184
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:55,360
id externals to and announce to the

185
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,840
mining

186
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:59,199
pool besides that

187
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:02,479
miner can use mining set external method

188
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:05,120
to reset the value of external one and

189
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:08,240
buy some externals too saved by miner

190
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,840
during the subscription

191
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:13,440
phase so far i have covered all the

192
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:16,240
important communication steps in stratum

193
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,599
protocol

194
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:20,240
next the math speaker will introduce the

195
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:23,759
rest of the presentation

197
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:27,280
million hello everyone i'm lucie from

198
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:30,240
landry university china now i will share

199
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:33,440
the latest funding in strident hacking

200
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,519
the main media attacking strategy has a

201
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:37,599
pretty long history

202
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:39,440
the most famous one

203
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,839
as mentioned in stratum way two's

204
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:45,360
introduction is the bitcoin attack

205
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,920
in this slide we name this

206
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:50,720
as direct job injection

207
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:54,240
because in bitcoin the attackers inject

208
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:57,519
the tasks hijack the shell sublimation

209
00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:00,640
and change its user labor

210
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:05,439
this is a user labor to attackers

211
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:09,360
bitcoin works well if attackers and

212
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,800
victim

213
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,360
use a simple when the connection is

214
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,040
properly ejected

215
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:17,120
but we all know that

216
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:20,880
it limits the man's mental effect

217
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,560
as attackers

218
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:25,920
we want to steal hash rate to anywhere

219
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,360
we want

220
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,839
in section 2 we present a simple

221
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:31,839
introduction

222
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:33,360
in strata

223
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,800
as mentioned

224
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:38,080
the numbers one is used to construct

225
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:41,200
column base and calculate the share

226
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:44,560
however extraneous one is different in

227
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:45,839
each

228
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:47,120
con

229
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,839
next

230
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:50,640
connection

231
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,399
in this situation

232
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:56,320
if we just follow the bitcoin's way to

233
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:59,279
submit share to another poll

234
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:02,560
the poll will reject the submission

235
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:05,120
because we cannot calculate the correct

236
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:08,320
share in this way

237
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,959
to make the

238
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:13,040
mains middle more

239
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:15,920
practical practical we make

240
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:19,519
two new measurement methods

241
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:23,680
a set exercise based means middle and

242
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,360
a time segment

243
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:28,160
based on the middle

244
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,640
the key question is to fix the external

245
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,480
one

246
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:35,040
at first we denote

247
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:37,839
two types of poles just in case

248
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:40,160
misunderstanding

249
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:43,200
the malaysia support is run by attackers

250
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:48,079
and the normal pole is the victim's po

251
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:51,279
at first

252
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:54,240
we see the normal situation we can see

253
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:58,880
the manner and the pull

254
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:01,600
works for a while everything well no

255
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:04,320
man's remains made up a very typical

256
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,079
situation

257
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:09,839
but for uh maine's mental model

258
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:12,720
the adversary the adversary keeps

259
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:15,360
three commun three connections

260
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:16,800
with the manner

261
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:21,359
the normal pole and the malicious pole

262
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:25,839
said west ring serves the job from

263
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:28,240
malicious pole into the drop floor of

264
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:30,800
the normal pole

265
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:34,480
the manner will work for normal pole and

266
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:38,399
our malicious pole

267
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:40,560
so at once we establish the connection

268
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:43,519
with the malicious mending poll and then

269
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:45,079
listen to the

270
00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:47,279
sub-subscription and authorization

271
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:49,920
message from the of the manner and

272
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:53,920
forwards them to the normal poll

273
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:57,120
after receiving this message

274
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:59,680
the meaning poll will respond the manner

275
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:03,839
is actual nuns 1 and x transcends 2 sets

276
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:07,120
which will be saved by the anniversary

277
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:09,120
and this adversary also saves the

278
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,839
difficulty and the job information sent

279
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:14,000
by the main impose

280
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,800
both the normal poll and the

281
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:19,680
malicious pearl

282
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:22,160
when the meta works for the normal power

283
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:25,040
for a period of time the adversary will

284
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:27,760
reset the actual non-serious actions 1

285
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:30,800
and action 2 says of the malicious pearl

286
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:33,200
and construct set difficulty and notify

287
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:36,160
message and then send them to the manner

288
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,760
to make the manual work for the

289
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:39,839
malicious poll

290
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:43,680
this process is based on the sad exonus

291
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:46,320
method such a said external method is a

292
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,959
standard mastering stratum particle

293
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:52,240
though is very seldom to say to be seen

294
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:55,200
in reward to strident traffic

295
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:58,160
but we read the documentation

296
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,200
of the

297
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,600
stratum particle and defend it can be

298
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:04,800
used for mine's middle attack

299
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:07,040
it can reset

300
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:07,920
the

301
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:11,599
actual nonsense one

302
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:15,760
then the adversary forwards the shares

303
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:18,880
to the malicious poll after completing

304
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,880
all the above steps

305
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:24,160
the many set extranunce method will be

306
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,880
used again to switch the manner to work

307
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:29,760
for the normal meaning pole and repeat

308
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:33,880
all the above steps

309
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:38,480
here is the sequence diagram

310
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,800
if the attackers unless they're fair

311
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:43,440
presence of the hash read it will be

312
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,440
very unobvious

313
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,600
the manner sensor pearl can hardly fit

314
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:50,000
this attacks

315
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,399
we can see from the

316
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:55,920
subsequence diagram the process is very

317
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,279
simple

318
00:13:57,279 --> 00:13:59,519
and

319
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,880
almost no actual cost

320
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:03,760
so

321
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:07,600
it has really good performance

322
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:11,120
but the

323
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,839
drop injection solution is not suitable

324
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:16,320
for every manner

325
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:19,279
therefore we have a third one

326
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:21,920
the time segment method

327
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:25,120
the adversary in set time segment method

328
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:28,000
hijacks tcp communication between the

329
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,560
manner and the normal form

330
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,800
and make it work for two

331
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,680
men in pole

332
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:37,839
respectively at the different time

333
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:39,519
periods

334
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:40,880
for example

335
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,920
in this finger the time segment is 10

336
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:45,199
minutes

337
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:47,680
the meaning the manner works for the

338
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:48,959
normal pole

339
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:51,390
for 10 minutes and it works for some

340
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:53,199
[Music]

341
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:55,920
molecules

342
00:14:56,079 --> 00:14:59,839
for the other one for 10 minutes

343
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:02,800
this method is based on reconnection

344
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:03,839
scheme

345
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:05,680
at the end of

346
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:07,839
the first attempt segment the

347
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:10,000
advancement will disconnect from the

348
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,480
manner and the normal poll

349
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:15,920
in the second time segment

350
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:18,720
segment the adversary is waiting for

351
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:21,920
reconnection from the manner and then

352
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:24,720
make a new connection to the malik

353
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:28,000
malicious poll the action nurse 1 is

354
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,320
refreshed

355
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:33,440
so our main mental attack

356
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,680
is affected

357
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:40,079
it's effective sorry

358
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:44,240
validate our method we made some probes

359
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:47,839
we use the btc pro as the back end uh

360
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:49,680
the post of the vr

361
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:52,240
the pc the btc power is the backend of

362
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:54,160
the poll.btc.com

363
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:56,800
it's open source project on github

364
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:59,839
reviews of two meaning pool to simulate

365
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:02,079
the normal pro and the malicious pearl

366
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:04,880
using this

367
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,880
and this is the manner we use in

368
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:11,199
manner it's a kind of manning software

369
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:13,519
that needs to be installed on the

370
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:14,880
manners

371
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:19,720
as opposed to software of course

372
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:24,639
we use

373
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:29,040
three video cards three gpus for

374
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:29,920
the

375
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:31,519
manning process

376
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:34,399
they do not use asic manners because

377
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:36,800
they are all sold out

378
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:39,360
i tried to buy some

379
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:43,360
of them but i failed

380
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:47,360
then

381
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:50,320
i will introduce the fourth book of the

382
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:54,480
java injection based on set externals

383
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,320
we build a port tab

384
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:59,440
it will give one share to the malicious

385
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:02,240
power after 10 shares submitted to the

386
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:05,560
normal poll

387
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:07,919
we can see from the log

388
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:11,760
the red half of this image is the output

389
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,760
of the text script

390
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:17,199
and the left part is output of the cc

391
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:18,480
manner

392
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,319
we can see the

393
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:23,039
manner receives the job message and the

394
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:24,720
difficulty

395
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,000
message

396
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,880
rejected and forwarded by the

397
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:31,440
anniversary successfully

398
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:34,160
just this

399
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:39,600
often after the manner submitted several

400
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,919
shares to the normal mining poll it

401
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:43,440
restored a

402
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:46,240
manning set of pronunciations message

403
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:49,360
constructed by our adversary

404
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,280
and it can be seen that the share

405
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,600
submitted based manner for the malicious

406
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:54,799
polls

407
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:57,840
accepted by the malicious poll

408
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,799
this is the k issue

409
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:02,240
we solve this

410
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:05,039
we fix this

411
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:08,639
we can see the log

412
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:18,039
now we also made a video for this

413
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:46,840
uh

414
00:19:51,950 --> 00:19:55,109
[Music]

415
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:03,679
the second one is the temp segment

416
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:06,480
during the timestamp segment attack our

417
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,559
adversary needs to switch com

418
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:10,960
connections to different ports at the

419
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:14,000
fixed time segment reset time segment to

420
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,440
10 minutes

421
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:18,880
in the first 10 minutes our adversary

422
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:21,840
will forward the sus subscription and

423
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:25,840
authorization message to the normal poll

424
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:28,000
the manner will only work for the normal

425
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,480
poll in the remaining time at the end of

426
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,240
the 10 minutes that the russia will

427
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:34,960
disconnect from the normal pole

428
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:37,039
in the next 10 minutes

429
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:39,679
the manner will reconnect to the pole

430
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:42,240
and the anniversary will hijack the tcp

431
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:45,360
connection to the malicious pole

432
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:47,360
the menu will only work for the

433
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:49,600
malicious spell in the remaining time

434
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:53,760
until the time segment ends

435
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:58,640
we can see the manner receives a job the

436
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:00,320
difficulty

437
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:03,120
and

438
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:05,840
to find it them forwarded by the

439
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:08,960
anniversary successfully and then

440
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:12,320
we can see the adversary adversary

441
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:14,640
successfully forwards a share submitted

442
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:20,080
by the manus to the normal meaning pole

443
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:23,760
at the end of the first 10 minutes

444
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,840
the stratum connection

445
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:27,600
interrupted

446
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,919
because the advancement is connected

447
00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:32,720
disconnect from the manner and the

448
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:34,640
normal pole

449
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:36,400
we can see

450
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:38,720
the connection is

451
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,400
interrupted

452
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,679
and then

453
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:43,200
the manner

454
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:45,760
reconnects to the pole

455
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:47,840
and the anniversary hijacks the

456
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:51,120
connection to the malicious poll we can

457
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:52,880
see

458
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:55,520
we can say the

459
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:56,720
start

460
00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:00,080
10 million passed start to the malicious

461
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:01,679
poll and the ten minute pass and the

462
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:04,000
center to the normal poll

463
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,679
is wrong the wrong than the wrong

464
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:10,400
the malicious poll has received an

465
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,640
accepted shares

466
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:14,799
submitted by the manner we can see it's

467
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:17,039
uh

468
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:19,679
blue

469
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:22,480
as the second 10 minutes ends the

470
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:25,280
adversary disconnects from the minerals

471
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:27,440
and the managed spell

472
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:30,240
and will be waiting for the reconnection

473
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:33,039
of the matter

474
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:39,720
we also made a video for this

475
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:55,559
uh

476
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:01,400
okay

477
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:10,760
um

478
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:19,080
okay

479
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:42,919
okay

480
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:56,559
now we summarize these two methods job

481
00:25:56,559 --> 00:25:59,039
injection is more powerful of course

482
00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:01,039
having better performance

483
00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:04,799
and more difficult to be detected

484
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:06,720
but some manners do not support the

485
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,799
acetate nonsense method

486
00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:11,840
making it useless in some situations

487
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:14,640
therefore we have a second one time

488
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:16,880
segment method can be used for almost

489
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:18,400
all manners

490
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:21,039
but it's much obvious in traffic and

491
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:24,400
will cause performance loss

492
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:25,600
because of

493
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:28,240
connect disconnect reconnect these two

494
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:29,600
content

495
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,440
inwards they are all

496
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:34,400
effective but the drop injection is much

497
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:37,640
more elegant

498
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:42,480
nowadays we all know many sps are using

499
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:45,360
traffic hijacking for illegal profit

500
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:47,120
making activities

501
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:50,000
such as pop-up advertisements

502
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,520
the most commonly thing

503
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:56,000
if they change the target of hijacking

504
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,640
to strengthen it will greatly help the

505
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:00,960
interest of manners

506
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:03,279
of course it's very dangerous to the

507
00:27:03,279 --> 00:27:07,400
blockchain community

508
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:12,320
okay that's all thank you

509
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:17,080
for your listening thanks
