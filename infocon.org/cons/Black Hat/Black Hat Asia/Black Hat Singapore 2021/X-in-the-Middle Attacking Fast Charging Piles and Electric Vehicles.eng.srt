team on blackheart asia

6
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:32,880
today our talk is called x in the media

7
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:35,760
attacking faster charging pairs and

8
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:39,280
electric records

22
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:27,280
now he is focusing on mobile security

23
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:30,000
and the iot security

24
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,560
he reported moon temporal

25
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:37,040
vulnerabilities of chrome and android

26
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:41,360
he also was because blackheads usa

27
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:43,360
hugging boss

28
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:46,960
has come in the census

29
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,240
and the tensorblade team

30
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:55,520
was funded by tencent security platform

31
00:01:55,520 --> 00:02:00,119
department in 2017

32
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,280
now we are focusing on security research

33
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,959
in the areas of aiot and cloud

34
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:11,200
virtualization

35
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:14,000
we have reported more than 200

36
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,840
availabilities to vendors such as google

37
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:22,000
ipo microsoft and amazon

38
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
if you want to know

39
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,800
more about our teens research

40
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:30,640
you can visit our blog

41
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:38,959
let's move on today's topic

42
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:43,760
our talk is many divided into four parts

43
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,440
the first part

44
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:48,160
we will introduce the electric car

45
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:52,000
charging technology and standards

46
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,360
the second part we will analyze the

47
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:59,040
attack surface of electric charging

48
00:02:59,040 --> 00:02:59,920
and

49
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:02,560
in the third part we will introduce what

50
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,519
is

51
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:05,760
x in the media attack

52
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:08,640
and finally we will introduce how we

53
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:12,000
attack the plug and charge technology in

54
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,560
the real world

55
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,840
as everyone knows

56
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:25,680
the rapid expansion of the electric car

57
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:26,720
market

58
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:30,000
has promoted the construction of

59
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,599
charging in first structure

60
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:35,920
the dc charging is the main charging

61
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:38,480
technology in the future

62
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:41,120
it has higher charging power

63
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,519
and in order to convert the charging

64
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:47,280
voltage and the current

65
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:50,080
electric recoil and the charging station

66
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:53,280
will communicate after being connected

67
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,159
to

68
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:58,280
complement the handshake

69
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:04,640
there are

70
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:07,439
different charging standards in

71
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:09,840
different countries

72
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,840
for example

73
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:14,480
all electric cars in china

74
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:15,680
must be

75
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:19,120
support lgbt standard

76
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,560
electric cars use cambus to communicate

77
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:25,360
with charging players

78
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:29,040
we are in most part of euro the system

79
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,759
as standards are used

80
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:34,479
and the electric cars and the charging

81
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:35,440
pairs

82
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:39,440
use plc to communicate

83
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:42,880
with the exception of tesla

84
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,840
who has his own

85
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:47,360
supercharger network

86
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,960
all over the world

87
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:54,599
it uses a private communication protocol

88
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:00,320
okay next

89
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,560
in addition

90
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:05,360
we also want to talk about where we

91
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:08,000
choose to study

92
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,199
the electric charging security

93
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:13,199
the main reason is that we found the

94
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:16,160
electric recoil's infrastructure is

95
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,880
making progress towards a

96
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,639
more intelligent

97
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:24,080
and more high-powered direction

98
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:27,280
but at the same time the construction of

99
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:29,440
the charging station is

100
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,919
accelerating all over the world

101
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:33,039
but it's

102
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:34,880
but there is

103
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:37,520
a little research on the security of

104
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:41,880
electric vehicle infrastructure

105
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:46,000
so we want to kind of try to research

106
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,479
the intersecurity

107
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:56,880
uh

108
00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:00,720
in the following section uh we were

109
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:04,080
breaking online another the attack

110
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:07,360
surface of electric recoil charging

111
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,039
first of all

112
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:10,240
electric

113
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:13,759
we call charging pairs are also internet

114
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:15,680
of things devices

115
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:19,600
which usually have built in distance and

116
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,880
operating

117
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,440
interface

118
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:27,280
so it means it's a tech surface involves

119
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:31,120
hardware systems customers

120
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,800
and communication

121
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,440
is very traditional

122
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:39,039
but our focus is on the security of the

123
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:42,800
communication protocol between the

124
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:46,319
electric vehicle and the charging pair

125
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:49,360
there will be a new and interesting

126
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:52,360
exploration

127
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:54,720
exploration

128
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,880
so

129
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,680
the following picture shows the

130
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:03,199
process of charging a car at a dc

131
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:05,280
charging station

132
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:08,000
the charging controller communicates

133
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,120
with the bms before charging to confirm

134
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,479
the

135
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:16,160
charging voltage and the current

136
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:19,919
which involves a lot of data exchange

137
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:21,120
so

138
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,240
we think

139
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,759
if we can

140
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:27,759
implement a major media attack

141
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:30,960
we may be able to find

142
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:34,560
some vulnerabilities in pms

143
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:39,039
and charging controls through fuzzing

144
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,440
second

145
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:46,000
maybe we can analyze the prior white

146
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,599
vertical and bypass identification with

147
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:53,199
identity association mechanism

148
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:54,639
or we can

149
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:57,919
damage the car by temporary with the

150
00:07:57,919 --> 00:08:01,840
charging watch and current

151
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:09,919
next we will share the section about x

152
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:12,800
in the media attack

153
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,039
first we will talk about its

154
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:18,080
architecture then we will take talk

155
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,080
about the challenges

156
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,840
and the solutions

157
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,120
we in

158
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:27,120
encountered in the testing process

159
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:30,479
and finally we will share the quick test

160
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:32,719
conclusions on

161
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:36,360
tesla's supercharger

162
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:45,600
in order to

163
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,720
conduct security testing safely and

164
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,240
community

165
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:56,000
we have to send a tool called x charger

166
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,440
the core

167
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:01,279
of x charger is a data processor

168
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:05,360
terminal based on stms 2030

169
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,680
to mcu under

170
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:10,959
all the raspberry pi

171
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:14,399
which associates a canvas message from

172
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:16,480
vms and charging

173
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:17,920
pairs

174
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:20,080
all cambus message cannot be

175
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:23,200
transmitting the normal name until they

176
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:27,440
are transferred through x-charger

177
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,399
which

178
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:30,560
allow us to

179
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,000
mandatory

180
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,120
buzzing and temporary

181
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:38,000
compass messages in

182
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,279
the whole charging process

183
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:44,160
another feature is that we

184
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:47,519
designed the whole tool into a

185
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:49,120
20 inch

186
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,640
switch case

187
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:53,839
which has two charging circuits

188
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:57,360
one is connected to the charging pair

189
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:00,880
and the other and is going connected to

190
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:04,720
the electric vehicle

191
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:07,519
the high watt current

192
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:10,240
is a direct turning connected

193
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:12,560
and only four compass communication

194
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:16,399
interface are exported to ensure

195
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:20,560
the high wattage safety

196
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:28,160
next

197
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:32,160
let's talk about why we do this and the

198
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:34,800
challenges we face

199
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:38,640
when we do security research

200
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:42,160
we think the most important things is

201
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:44,959
should be able to ensure that

202
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:46,480
personal skills

203
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:49,680
personal safety and recall safety are

204
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,200
not being

205
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,040
surrendered

206
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:56,000
in the test

207
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:59,680
the discharging can reach a voltage

208
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,360
of up to

209
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,279
715

210
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:04,800
watts

211
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:07,720
or a current of

212
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:11,120
120 m

213
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:13,519
what's a short

214
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:14,480
current

215
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,000
currency

216
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,360
is very dangerous for the tester and the

217
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,519
car

218
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:24,959
secondly secondly we hope that the

219
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:27,279
attack equipment

220
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:30,320
should be hunting comfortable

221
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,640
suitable for all

222
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:35,519
electric workers with chinese dc

223
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:38,000
charging standard

224
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,839
instead of requiring customization for

225
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:44,000
each brand of

226
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,440
electric cars or charging pairs

227
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:50,000
we also found the compass communication

228
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,920
requires no

229
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,360
latency

230
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,760
and the main media attacks

231
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:58,639
needs two insurance and friends were not

232
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:00,320
a big job

233
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:04,880
so all three parties were dissolved very

234
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:08,839
very very important

235
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,800
and we rented

236
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:19,279
we rented a tesla module for testing

237
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:22,000
and we found that there is a

238
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,480
charging port

239
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:28,480
exported to the canvas interface with a

240
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,560
separate plug

241
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,079
which means

242
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:34,959
that we may be able to

243
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:38,480
disconnect the origin connection in the

244
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,079
trunk

245
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:45,199
and to achieve a managed media attack

246
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:48,639
but the problem is that the main need to

247
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:50,240
land damage

248
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,040
so

249
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:53,839
which doesn't

250
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,480
seem suitable for

251
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:02,440
such a operation on a rented record

252
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:12,720
a perfect solution we have given is that

253
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,399
the increment

254
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:16,240
shown below

255
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:17,600
as you can see

256
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,040
that it

257
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:23,040
has two charging circuits

258
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:26,160
one end is connected to the electric

259
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:27,440
vehicle

260
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,519
and the other end

261
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:35,480
is connected to the charging connector

262
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,440
the compass interface of bms

263
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:40,560
of the

264
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:43,440
electric vehicle and the canvas

265
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:46,560
interface of the charging pair

266
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:50,560
are all exported on the surface

267
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:52,160
at the same time

268
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:53,839
we had

269
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:54,800
we have

270
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,560
customers

271
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:59,519
customers a door

272
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:00,480
black

273
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:03,360
charging cable to connect the equipment

274
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,120
under the car

275
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,639
this equipment

276
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:07,519
is

277
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:10,079
designed by us and made by a

278
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:13,550
professional vendor in xinjiang

279
00:14:13,550 --> 00:14:15,040
[Music]

280
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:18,160
which can ensure the safety of high

281
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:18,959
water

282
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:22,239
age power use

283
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:32,160
this equipment is not cheap but

284
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:35,439
it's very safety

285
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:38,880
and there are many

286
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:42,240
open source tools available for compass

287
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,279
the

288
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:47,120
mandatory funding and temporary

289
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,760
to use both respiratory pile and the

290
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,360
two-way kind

291
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:55,519
extension boards we can use person to

292
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:56,800
develop a

293
00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:00,800
testing from work and built in ubuntu

294
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:03,279
system

295
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:05,120
here to the

296
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:07,680
um some reason

297
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:08,720
we will

298
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:11,120
release more details

299
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:14,880
and the code in the future

300
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:22,079
and after this

301
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:26,639
we can use x charge to do something so

302
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:30,800
we use exchange to do a quick test on

303
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:34,959
the tesla supercharged in china

304
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:38,079
and the test results very fast

305
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:41,519
that the device can

306
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:44,959
capture the message successfully

307
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:46,079
but

308
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:49,199
we do not have any more tests

309
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:52,880
because we do not have the tpc vr to

310
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:56,880
translate the comments message

311
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,720
inclusion

312
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:08,000
we found that some of the message in the

313
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,600
compass

314
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:12,160
communication between supercharger and

315
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:14,639
the tesla module 3

316
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:17,600
user provides protocols

317
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:20,959
and some message confirmed to the gbt

318
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:22,800
standard

319
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:25,839
when testing with the modestry there is

320
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:28,000
a kind of property

321
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,279
that

322
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:31,519
it will not be able to

323
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:33,759
charge successfully

324
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:38,480
the reason is there being an analysis

325
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:39,600
if you

326
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:42,240
want so if you want to

327
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,560
reverse

328
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:48,079
reverse the complete protocol

329
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:51,839
it may be a better choice to analyze the

330
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:57,399
firmware of bms or the supercharger

331
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:07,039
and in addition to the tester

332
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:08,559
supercharger

333
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:12,079
we spend the more time in public

334
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:14,400
charging station

335
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:17,760
and in the following section we will

336
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:20,480
share how to attach the plug and charge

337
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:23,839
technology in public charging station in

338
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:25,839
china

339
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:26,720
first

340
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:30,400
we will introduce in the

341
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,559
in the principle of

342
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:36,160
black and church and how to use exchange

343
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,440
toys

344
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:42,400
to attack it to achieve fully charging

345
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:46,240
balancing we will briefly

346
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:49,280
the future trend of the

347
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:52,720
charging technology

348
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:59,200
plug and charge is a new way of

349
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,400
automating

350
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,240
payment for

351
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:04,880
electric vehicle charging

352
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:09,440
users don't need do not need to swipe

353
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:15,360
swipe their cards or scan codes

354
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:19,520
just connect the charging pair to the

355
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:21,760
recoil charging port to

356
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:24,640
automatically complete the

357
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:29,039
identity authentication payment

358
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:31,840
for electric we call complaints that

359
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,200
build on

360
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:36,000
charging pairs such as

361
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,760
such as tesla

362
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:40,559
private communication and authentication

363
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:41,760
protocol

364
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:44,880
can be used to ensure the security of

365
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:47,919
plug and charge

366
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:52,000
but considering the capability and the

367
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,520
cost

368
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:57,600
some public charter station operators

369
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,200
have chosen the

370
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,039
have chosen to use

371
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:04,160
where and number to complete

372
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:07,200
we call identity authentication on the

373
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,240
basic

374
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:11,440
of gbt standard

375
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:14,640
we think we think our operators

376
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:17,840
do not realize that when number is not a

377
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:21,639
security identification

378
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:25,280
identification in

379
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:29,678
in-secure combust communication

380
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,679
the gbt

381
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:39,679
is the chinese's standard for

382
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:43,360
electric vehicle battery charging

383
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:47,200
cable charging standard gpg is based on

384
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:50,880
sae g1939

385
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:52,799
network vertical

386
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:56,640
and use the cambus with a point to point

387
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:59,120
connection between the charger

388
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:00,480
and the

389
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:04,720
battery management system

390
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:07,919
the transmission rate of

391
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:09,600
215

392
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:15,719
kbits per second is used by default

393
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:26,320
charging communication involves both the

394
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:29,120
battery management system and the

395
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:32,159
charging agree on the problem

396
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:35,600
requirement of vehicle and the both the

397
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:39,200
amperages and the water ranges used

398
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,360
during the charging

399
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:43,200
as well as

400
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:46,000
mandatory the charging process

401
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,799
with gpt protocol communication is

402
00:20:49,799 --> 00:20:52,720
divided into following

403
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,240
part

404
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:58,080
part during the charging process

405
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:03,559
it is divided into sixth part

406
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:14,320
in the handshake we call

407
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:16,080
recognization

408
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:18,799
but the charger connection

409
00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:21,200
check is completed

410
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,640
and the general

411
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:25,280
information such as protocol

412
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:28,159
which and the vehicle information

413
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:31,640
is exchanged

414
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:35,120
such as battery type

415
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:38,559
rear number and so on

416
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:42,320
what we most concerned is about that

417
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:45,200
during the handshake identification

418
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:47,679
process of part 2

419
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:49,520
the b main

420
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:51,360
bms will

421
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:54,159
transmit the rear end number to the

422
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:57,720
charging pair

423
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:08,880
after actual testing

424
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:12,960
we use contours and the

425
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,159
dbc

426
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:15,440
failed to

427
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:18,320
successfully translated

428
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:22,880
all message during the charging process

429
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:26,880
we found the bms of electric vehicle

430
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:30,400
transmitted the records were numbered to

431
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,320
the charging power for identity

432
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:35,679
altercation in brm message

433
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:40,280
during the handshake recognization

434
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:45,760
so

435
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:48,960
the following is the completed

436
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:53,760
plugging and charging the architecture

437
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:55,039
first

438
00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:58,080
the car online needs to register and

439
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:01,120
defend the records when number on the

440
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:03,840
charging pair operators

441
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,679
application

442
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:06,840
and

443
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:08,640
accredited

444
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,320
automatic payment

445
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:12,559
secondly

446
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:15,360
when the car owner is charging

447
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:18,880
he only needs to direct me back and

448
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:22,159
charge income into the inventory card to

449
00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:24,559
charge

450
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,919
the charge pair will upload the wheel

451
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:32,880
and transmitted the front to the

452
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,240
ems

453
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:35,120
to

454
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:38,960
operated cloud server

455
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:42,240
and the operator will query and return

456
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:43,600
the user

457
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:45,279
gradients

458
00:23:45,279 --> 00:23:46,000
to

459
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:51,279
the run in the background database

460
00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:54,320
after the charting payer receives the

461
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:56,320
user's credence

462
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:58,320
they will start charging and

463
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:00,320
automatically pay

464
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:04,678
at the end of the charge

465
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:16,880
real number is a unique code

466
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:20,159
including a screen number used by

467
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:22,799
automotive installed

468
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:25,679
to identity intervention

469
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:26,880
recourse

470
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:30,080
the biggest the biggest problem is where

471
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:32,960
number is a public blend text

472
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:34,640
information

473
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:37,840
with specific coding rulers

474
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:40,480
and they can also be obtained

475
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:46,520
from the front windows shield of the car

476
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:57,919
in order to configure the attack script

477
00:24:57,919 --> 00:24:59,279
quickly

478
00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:01,760
we have written a tool

479
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:04,799
that is the main function including the

480
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:08,159
tempering of vrn number

481
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:11,600
charging voltage and the current

482
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:16,400
and it also supports the bms termination

483
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:19,039
is very interesting

484
00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:22,960
so that we can we can test the charging

485
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:27,200
panel without a record

486
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:31,360
internship will save many time

487
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:42,080
in order to verify our tour in the real

488
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:43,279
world

489
00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:47,360
we rented five electric cars in

490
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:49,360
of different models

491
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:52,480
and tested between temporal charging

492
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:55,520
stations that support plug and the

493
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:57,360
charge

494
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:01,440
we verified that after b after obtaining

495
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:05,360
the rare number on the render street of

496
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:06,720
the vehicle

497
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,400
the charging pair

498
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,520
can be

499
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:12,880
successfully attacked by x charger

500
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:17,279
to achieve the free charging

501
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:20,320
and for now

502
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:23,440
all the vulnerability we found have been

503
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:24,799
notified

504
00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:28,320
to the render and fixed

505
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,240
ok

506
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:32,720
my part is over

507
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:36,480
the following time will be shared by my

508

some of the security risks

529
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:29,120
mentioned in our talks may be resolved

530
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:32,840
in

531
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:35,679
addiction we also see another new

532
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:38,480
standard iso

533
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:40,640
1511a

534
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:43,000
is a standard for

535
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,760
vehicle-to-grid communication

536
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:46,720
use

537
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:48,960
h metrics

538
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,640
encryptions and

539
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:51,919
digital

540
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:54,799
signatures to ensure the security of

541
00:27:54,799 --> 00:27:56,960
communication between

542
00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:00,720
electronic cars and charging station

543
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:04,000
and supports plus and trust

544
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:08,000
it use plc communication which is mainly

545
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,159
used in railroad

546
00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:13,600
through the discussions of these trends

547
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:16,960
we are very happy to see that security

548
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:20,240
has become a must be considered

549
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:23,360
in these standards

550
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:26,559
we believe that in the near future

551
00:28:26,559 --> 00:28:28,240
when

552
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:31,600
this new technologies and new standards

553
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:34,399
are applicated in the real world

554
00:28:34,399 --> 00:28:36,720
they will promote the security

555
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:39,520
development of the entire electronic

556
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:42,480
vehicle charging industries

557
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:44,559
okay

558
00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:46,720
okay that's all

559
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:49,120
thanks for your listening

560
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:51,760
and if you have any questions you can

561
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:56,600
connect us by this meal

562
