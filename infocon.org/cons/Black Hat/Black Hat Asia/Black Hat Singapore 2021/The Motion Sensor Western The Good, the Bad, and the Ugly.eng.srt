00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:19,199
hello and welcome to my talk the motion

3
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:21,760
sensor western

4
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:23,600
i will start by introducing myself my

00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:27,039
name is benaci i'm a computer scientist

6
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:29,519
and a former google employee

7
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:31,760
i'm a phd student at bengal university

8
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:33,680
of the negev and a researcher at cyber

9
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:36,320
at bgu and my research focuses on side

10
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:38,160
channel attacks sound recovery via

11
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:40,239
non-acoustic data

12
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:42,559
security of autonomous vehicles and you

13
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:44,559
can read more about my research

14
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:46,960
at my website or follow me

15
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:49,520
on twitter

16
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:52,000
this is the agenda for today we will

17
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,719
start by understanding the good the

18
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:57,680
advantages of motion sensors

19
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:00,160
we will then cover the security risks

20
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,079
and the privacy risk that motion sensors

21
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:05,360
supposed to devices and individuals

22
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:07,280
and at the end of the talk

23
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:09,280
i will discuss about the takeaways about

24
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:11,439
this uh from this uh

25
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:12,720
entire talk

26
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:16,798
and we will do the q a session

27
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:19,200
let's start by understanding the good

28
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,560
now

29
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:23,280
um mems motion sensors

30
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:25,840
are electrical devices that utilize a

31
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:27,439
sensor to detect

32
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:28,960
nearby motion

33
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:31,119
and in this talk we focus on two

34
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:33,600
specific motion sensors which are the

35
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,119
mems gyroscope

36
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:36,640
which is a device

37
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,880
which is used to measure the angular

38
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:41,680
velocity and mem's accelerometer which

39
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:44,079
is a device which is used to measure the

40
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:47,679
rate of change of a velocity

41
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:49,600
now

42
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,759
these motion sensors have many

43
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:52,960
advantages

44
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:55,200
one of which is that they are very cheap

45
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,680
you can buy them on aliexpress and

46
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,360
easily integrate them to your

47
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,360
microcontrollers

48
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:04,240
they provide sufficient accuracy for

49
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,000
many users that i will discuss about

50
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
later on

51
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,440
they consider

52
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,440
low power consumers so you can integrate

53
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:14,160
them to battery operated devices

54
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,840
they are very small each of your

55
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,120
smartphone

56
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:20,959
smartphones consists of

57
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:23,360
a motion sensor

58
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,200
and as a result

59
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,120
motion sensors that become more and more

60
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,520
ubiquitous in the last

61
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,599
few years ever since they were

62
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:33,120
integrated to

63
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,440
iphone

64
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,840
and they are now integrated in many iot

65
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,040
devices

66
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,959
and this includes smartphones and

67
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:42,080
tablets

68
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:45,440
and smart watches and fitness trackers

69
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:46,800
and drones

70
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,319
and even in some headphones and in many

71
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:52,800
other iot devices

72
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,239
now their data

73
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:56,560
is used for various tasks and this

74
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,239
includes

75
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:00,159
real-time automatic user gesture

76
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:02,640
recognition for example this is a

77
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:05,360
smartphone's detects lifting

78
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:08,800
uh with uh by analyzing uh data

79
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,599
from motion sensors

80
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:14,000
also real-time automatic stabilization

81
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,319
which is uh for example in gopro cameras

82
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:17,280
which are

83
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,680
stabilized automatically

84
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,440
this is also done by obtaining and

85
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:24,720
analyzing data from motion sensors

86
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,400
they provide

87
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,879
improved gaming experience

88
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:30,879
for example they can turn a smartphone

89
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:33,280
into an air joystick also they provide

90
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,519
real-time user activity recognition now

91
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:39,440
for example detecting walking

92
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,840
and user health monitoring for example

93
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,440
counting steps

94
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,879
and finally they are also used for

95
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:47,760
navigation they are part of

96
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,159
imus

97
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:52,159
and here's an interesting fact most

98
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:53,840
everyone in the audience is being

99
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:57,040
sampled by motion sensors in at least

100
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:01,400
one device for most of the day

101
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,439
okay so let's understand the bed and

102
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:05,360
when i say the bed i actually

103
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,680
mean to the security of the devices

104
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,920
containing motions and so on

105
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:13,120
now in 2007 resonant acoustic injection

106
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,920
frequency was identified as a problem

107
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:18,399
that causes performance degradation

108
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:19,358
of

109
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:21,759
mems motion sensors it was it was found

110
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:23,680
by several studies

111
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,120
and most mems gyroscope and

112
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,680
accelerometers have a unique reason and

113
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,440
frequency that is related to the

114
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:30,960
physical characteristics of the

115
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,880
structure

116
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:35,440
and as a result of this resonance most

117
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,120
mems motion sensors generate an

118
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,759
unexpected output that may cause the

119
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:41,840
related system to malfunction

120
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:44,639
in response to sound played at the

121
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:46,960
resonant frequency

122
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,800
now this resonant frequencies are often

123
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,040
considered to be commercial secrets

124
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,840
however previous studies have already

125
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,040
found that

126
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,479
the resonant frequency for mem's

127
00:04:56,479 --> 00:04:57,840
gyroscope

128
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:01,039
are somewhere between 8 kilohertz and 28

129
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:03,840
kilohertz and for mem's accelerometer is

130
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,759
somewhere between 2 kilohertz and 13

131
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:08,400
kilohertz

132
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:09,680
so

133
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,520
an immediate question that arises is how

134
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,759
attackers can find or identify the

135
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:16,639
resonant frequency of a motion sensor if

136
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:20,560
it is not uh already known

137
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:22,479
and basically they need to apply the

138
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:24,400
following attack which is the resonant

139
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,639
acoustic injection frequency attack and

140
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:28,479
first of all they need given a motion

141
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:30,240
sensor the range around the resonant

142
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,960
frequency can be detected as follows

143
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:34,400
they need to produce a signal of a

144
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,800
frequency scan which some of you

145
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,360
maybe know as chirp or sweep

146
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:43,199
and it is better to uh

147
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:45,360
to produce it in the range of the

148
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,960
frequencies that i just discussed on

149
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:48,800
[Music]

150
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,160
now the next thing that they need to do

151
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,479
is to play the signal via speakers in

152
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:55,840
proximity to the motion sensor

153
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,280
and finally they need to look for

154
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:59,039
anomalies in the output of the motion

155
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:01,280
sensor or the behavior of the containing

156
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:04,840
device and identify the resonant

157
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:06,880
frequency based on

158
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:09,280
these anomalies

159
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,960
so what are the anomalies that attackers

160
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,800
need to look for when they apply there

161
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,560
is an acoustic injection frequency

162
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:15,440
attack

163
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,560
so

164
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,080
as you can see the picture on the right

165
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:18,960
side

166
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:21,440
shows how the original output of a

167
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:24,240
gyroscope which you can see it in red

168
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,560
was changed in response to the attack

169
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:27,840
which you can see

170
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:30,639
the change output in blue

171
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:33,120
and you can see that in some cases like

172
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,199
this case the attack increases the

173
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:37,039
output the gyroscope

174
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:40,160
outputs a standard deviation

175
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,520
the range

176
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:44,240
the absolute minimum and maximum values

177
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:47,759
and basically you get the idea

178
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:50,400
in other cases like

179
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,240
the case that you can see in the picture

180
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,160
on the right the attack completely

181
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,639
distorts the original signal

182
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:58,639
and as you can see by applying the

183
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:01,120
attack attackers can control the output

184
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,840
of the motion sensor

185
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,000
and as you can see this

186
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,919
results clearly show that attackers can

187
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:10,000
spoof the output of a target motion

188
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,319
sensor and affect the algorithms that

189
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:16,560
rely on the motion sensor output

190
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,400
now here's the question given that the

191
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,560
resonant frequency of emotion sensors is

192
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,400
known either it was identified or either

193
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,840
it was known

194
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:26,400
in advance what are the risks that the

195
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,560
resonant acoustic injection frequency

196
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:32,080
attack poses to devices

197
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:32,880
and

198
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:35,120
i would like to start by introducing an

199
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,759
interesting attack now as i mentioned

200
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:38,800
before

201
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,599
gyroscopes are integrated to

202
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:43,840
probably most of the drones nowadays and

203
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,440
the drone is a real-time system that

204
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:48,560
continuously uses

205
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,800
the data obtained from the gyroscope to

206
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:53,840
stabilize itself while flying

207
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,680
and basically

208
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:58,000
the following operation is being

209
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,680
executed several times a second

210
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,520
measurements from the gyroscope are

211
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:06,479
obtained for each access and the drone

212
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:09,039
stabilize itself by adjusting the

213
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:11,440
copter's velocity according to this

214
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,120
measurements

215
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:15,199
now as i mentioned before this procedure

216
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:17,840
is executed a few times on each second

217
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:21,199
by a drone's operating system

218
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:24,479
now in 2016 a group of scientists

219
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:26,560
demonstrated a new technique aimed at

220
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:29,520
interfering with the drone's flight

221
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,759
they actually applied the the attack

222
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:33,760
that i just described before

223
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,360
and they show that by applying there is

224
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,360
an acoustic injection frequency attack

225
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,719
against drones

226
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:41,200
they were able to prevent a drone on the

227
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,839
ground from ascending and crashing a

228
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:46,640
flying drone

229
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,959
now as you can see in

230
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:50,880
this picture this was their experimental

231
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:53,920
setup the drone actually unable to

232
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:54,880
ascend

233
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,720
because of the array of speakers that is

234
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:59,040
being directed to him and is connected

235
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,279
to a laptop which produces

236
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:02,240
uh

237
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,920
this

238
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,600
the signal around the

239
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:09,000
resonant frequency

240
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:12,720
now as i mentioned before accelerometers

241
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,080
are also

242
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:17,040
integrated in the vast majority of their

243
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,880
smart the smart watches and fitness

244
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:22,080
trackers and they are used to track many

245
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,080
of the activities performed by the user

246
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:26,240
now for example this can be step

247
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,440
counting

248
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,440
now many companies

249
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,680
incentivize people to exercise by

250
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:34,080
offering reward programs tied to their

251
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:37,279
personal fitness tracking list means

252
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:40,000
now basically it means that the user can

253
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,600
earn free points

254
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,600
by reaching the daily target of steps

255
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,279
now you can see it in the advertisement

256
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:47,600
above

257
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:50,959
in 2017 a group of scientists

258
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:53,040
demonstrated a new technique to spoof

259
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:55,040
the step counter and they were able to

260
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:57,760
show that by applying 40 minutes of the

261
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,920
resonant acoustic injection frequency

262
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:02,320
attack against the fitness tracker

263
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,640
attackers were able to register

264
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,720
more than 2 000 steps

265
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:09,120
and earn 21 reward points on this

266
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:13,839
website without taking any single step

267
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,680
now i want to summarize uh the part of

268
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:20,000
security of

269
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
devices that consists of

270
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,800
that contain motion sensors and

271
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,399
the availability and integrity of

272
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:28,959
devices with integrated motion sensors

273
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:32,000
can be violated by the recent acoustic

274
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,040
injection frequency attack

275
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,880
however spoofing a device with the

276
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,399
motion sensors

277
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:40,000
requires the attacker to place the

278
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,160
speakers in proximity to the attack

279
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:44,640
device and this is because

280
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,480
sound deteriorates significantly with

281
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,399
distance

282
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:50,640
and the main conclusion is that the

283
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:53,600
feasibility of this attack is highly

284
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:56,399
dependent on the attack device and the

285
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:58,800
reality of the threat model

286
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,800
now there are some good news

287
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,880
in some cases the attack isn't

288
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:05,120
considered a practical threat now for

289
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:07,839
example crashing a flying drone used for

290
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:11,040
deliveries uh is not practical using

291
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,560
this attack and this is because it is

292
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,320
how to apply the attack from great

293
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:17,279
distances and bear in mind the drones

294
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:19,519
usually fly in

295
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:22,320
high altitudes

296
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,800
however there are some bad news in other

297
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,320
cases

298
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,519
the attack is

299
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:29,680
considered the practical threat and now

300
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,440
for example spoofing the step counter of

301
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,079
a smart watch um because attackers can

302
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:36,320
attack their own devices and

303
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,680
spoof

304
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:41,040
uh the integrity of uh the data of the

305
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,839
step counter

306
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:47,360
okay so let's understand

307
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:49,680
what is ugly about motion sensors and

308
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:52,000
when i discuss about this section i

309
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,079
mainly refer to the

310
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:57,360
how this data can be used to violate

311
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,920
individuals privacy

312
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:02,320
now motion sensors are integrated to

313
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,480
smartphones and smartwatch i discussed

314
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:07,360
about it before and this part

315
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:09,200
focus on data

316
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:12,079
of motion sensor data obtained from

317
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:15,279
smartphones and smart watches

318
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:17,120
now smartphone and smartwatches are very

319
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,959
unique devices because they are carried

320
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:22,560
almost 24 7 by the users

321
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:23,600
and

322
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,920
here's the question how can attackers

323
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:28,160
obtain motion sensor data from these

324
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:30,160
devices

325
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:31,760
so there are two

326
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,680
primary ways that attackers can obtain

327
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:36,480
motion sensor data the first way is

328
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,959
directly from these devices and this can

329
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:40,800
be done by sampling the motion sensor

330
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,959
via the browser when the user visits a

331
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:46,160
compromised website and this can be

332
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,760
the result for example of a phishing

333
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,440
attack

334
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,120
another way is by sampling the motion

335
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:53,120
sensor via an installed malicious

336
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:55,279
application and in other ways by

337
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:56,800
sampling the motion sensor via a

338
00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:00,000
malicious sdk integrated in a legitimate

339
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,279
application

340
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:04,399
this is the direct way to obtain

341
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:07,360
motion sensor data from these devices

342
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,360
however there is the indirect way and as

343
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,440
you know data from

344
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:14,000
devices is collected and sent to data

345
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,120
centers

346
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:18,079
and attackers can obtain data indirectly

347
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:20,320
by hacking a legitimate application data

348
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:22,720
center and exfiltrate the data to their

349
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:25,120
possess

350
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:27,680
now let us assume that attackers were

351
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:30,720
able to obtain motion sensor data what

352
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,560
are the risk that

353
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:35,440
this data poses to individuals

354
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,360
now here's an interesting case study and

355
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:39,600
interesting question can motion sensor

356
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:43,360
data be used to recover speech

357
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:46,399
now surprisingly at using security 14

358
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:48,959
seven years ago a group of scientists

359
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:51,440
found that gyroscope also captured

360
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:54,079
acoustics

361
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:56,320
now they were able to classify isolated

362
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,800
words by analyzing gyroscope data they

363
00:13:58,800 --> 00:13:59,920
named their

364
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:03,440
paper in the research gyrophone

365
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:04,480
and

366
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,160
seven years ago

367
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:07,199
uh

368
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:09,519
the attack was considered somehow very

369
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:12,240
impractical and this was because

370
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:14,839
uh back then a smartphone operating

371
00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:17,680
system limited the sampling rate from

372
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:21,519
the gyroscope to about 200 hertz

373
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:23,279
now as a result the accuracy of their

374
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:26,000
model which relied on k nearest neighbor

375
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,639
was only slight better than a random gas

376
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:31,279
and also the attack vector relied on a

377
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:33,680
very loud speech so basically i consider

378
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,920
this attack seven years ago as

379
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:38,079
impractical

380
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:40,240
however during the last seven years the

381
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,240
practicality of the method has improved

382
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:46,720
significantly and from 2015 to 2019

383
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,240
an increased understanding regarding

384
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:50,480
this attack vector was gained

385
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:52,000
and the first insight was that mems

386
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,839
accelerometers are more sensitive to

387
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:57,040
acoustics than gyroscopes

388
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:58,639
and also a second insight that was

389
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:01,519
gained is that the effect of acoustics

390
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:04,320
of motion sensors is increased when the

391
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,639
smartphone and the speakers share the

392
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:08,800
same physical surface

393
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:09,839
and

394
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:11,920
these two insights somehow increase the

395
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:13,760
practicality of

396
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,279
this entire

397
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:18,000
threat model of recovering sound

398
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,279
via motion sensor data

399
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:24,240
now finally about a year ago

400
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,959
a group of scientists uh showed and

401
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:28,079
present

402
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:31,199
in exciting research at ndss and they

403
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:33,279
showed that they were able to

404
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:35,680
improve the attack vector significantly

405
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:37,120
and make it a practical threat to

406
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:39,120
privacy and

407
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,959
this was mainly the result

408
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:43,839
of that in some smartphone nowadays um

409
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:46,160
the operating system allow

410
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:49,199
a sampling rate of 500 hertz

411
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:51,839
and also they use a different type of

412
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:53,920
classification method which they

413
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:56,079
actually use neural networks were used

414
00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:58,560
to classify uh the isolated words

415
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,720
instead of the k n approach that was

416
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:04,320
used uh by the guys from the gyrophone

417
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:07,680
and this yields excellent accuracy of

418
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,279
classification

419
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:11,839
also in their case the attack

420
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:14,079
vector relies on speech at the normal

421
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:16,320
volume rather than in

422
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,720
high volume as was in the case of

423
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:21,360
gyrophone and as a result they made they

424
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,680
make the attack they made the attack

425
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:26,479
very practical

426
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:29,680
now here is some bad news if smartphones

427
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:31,759
manufacturers will allow a greater

428
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:33,920
sampling rate of the integrated motion

429
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:35,680
sensors in the future

430
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:38,880
we might even face a greater problem

431
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,880
which is a complete sound recovery of

432
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:43,120
the speech which

433
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:45,040
will take the signal and the signal will

434
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:47,839
be uh perceptible and understood in the

435
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:49,199
human ear

436
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:51,600
rather than what

437
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,199
these methods are able to provide now

438
00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:55,120
which is the classification of isolated

439
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:58,079
world or isolated words with preliminary

440
00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:00,638
dictionary

441
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:02,800
now here's an another question to the

442
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:05,039
audience now can motion sensor data be

443
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:07,520
used for key logging

444
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:08,640
now for those of you who are not

445
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,400
familiar with the concept of key logging

446
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,400
key logging is the process of recovering

447
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:15,760
the type text or password from data

448
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:17,520
and various methods will already

449
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:20,319
suggested to create keyloggers

450
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:21,760
now

451
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:23,839
keylogging is usually done by analyzing

452
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:26,400
data influenced by the side effects of

453
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:29,039
typing for example acoustic data

454
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:31,360
obtained from microphone can be used to

455
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:33,919
recognize or to identify the keys that

456
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:35,600
are typed

457
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:38,000
or pressed

458
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,600
now if a user

459
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:42,000
wears a smartwatch while typing on a

460
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,200
keyboard we expect the data from the

461
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,039
motion sensor

462
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:48,000
it will

463
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,679
expect this data to indicate the

464
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:52,880
movement of the list on the keyboard

465
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:53,919
however

466
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:56,480
attackers still need to overcome a

467
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:58,320
primary challenge which is the missing

468
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,559
information now assuming that the user

469
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:02,320
wears the smartwatch

470
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:04,960
on his left hand

471
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,960
attackers can only recover the

472
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,559
characters on the left side of the

473
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:11,280
keyboard so the characters that were

474
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:13,360
typed on the right side of the keyboard

475
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:14,640
are missing in the world that they are

476
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:15,679
trying to

477
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:18,160
recover

478
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:19,840
now

479
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:23,280
various studies have suggested um

480
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:25,440
methods to

481
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,440
fill in the missing gaps

482
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,919
and the first stage that they suggested

483
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:30,640
is

484
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:33,200
attackers can easily detect strokes on

485
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,480
the left side of the keyboard by

486
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:37,679
analyzing data from motion sensors

487
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:40,559
and the next thing uh is that attackers

488
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:41,919
can identify

489
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:44,160
missing strokes on the right side of the

490
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,520
keyboard

491
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:47,600
by analyzing the motion sensor signaling

492
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,919
the time domain and by doing so they can

493
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:52,160
identify gaps and infer the number of

494
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:54,880
missing characters

495
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:57,280
now uh

496
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:59,679
attackers can use the statistical model

497
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:01,679
to fill in the missing characters using

498
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:04,400
a dictionary and surprisingly this

499
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,080
approach was implemented in various

500
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,039
studies

501
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:08,960
showing good accuracy in recovering

502
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:11,440
typing

503
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:13,120
now the conclusions

504
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:15,600
key logging of the qwerty uh keyboard

505
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,919
via smartwatch motion sensor is quite

506
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:19,200
practical

507
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,280
now the same approach can can be used to

508
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:24,320
recover text typed on a smartphone

509
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:26,320
touchscreen keyboard

510
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:27,840
and

511
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:29,600
keylogging of the pin codes vi

512
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,600
smartwatch motion sensor is only

513
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:34,559
possible if the user uses the hand with

514
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:36,799
the smartwatch to press

515
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:38,960
the buttons the dictionary in this case

516
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,880
won't help him because pin codes are not

517
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:44,400
something that can be statistically

518
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:47,919
that can help statistically to recover

519
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:48,799
the

520
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:50,840
missing

521
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:54,559
password okay now the last case study is

522
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:56,160
uh another question that i want you to

523
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:58,559
think of is can motion sensor data be

524
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:00,720
used to detect whether an individual was

525
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,080
intoxicated

526
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:03,280
and

527
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:05,520
let us assume that the answer is yes the

528
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:08,000
risks to individuals privacy are as

529
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,240
follows the primary risk is that in some

530
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:12,000
muslim countries around the world

531
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,559
intoxication is prohibited by law

532
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:17,120
and government and governments penalize

533
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:20,400
citizens for violating this law now the

534
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,640
secondary is that this approach can be

535
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:25,679
used to learn about another individual

536
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:28,000
habits now for example by parents to

537
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,440
learn about their child

538
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:33,919
now assuming that the party was able to

539
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:37,200
obtain an individual motion sensor data

540
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,760
can the data be used by this party to

541
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:41,360
determine whether the individual was

542
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:43,600
intoxicated or not

543
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,520
so police officers are trained to

544
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:48,000
identify an intoxicated individual based

545
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,320
on the gate now you are all probably

546
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:52,559
familiar with the work and turn sobriety

547
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:53,679
test

548
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:54,880
and

549
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:57,440
the this field the sobriety test has

550
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:59,280
been used by police officers for many

551
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:00,320
years

552
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:01,120
and

553
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:03,600
here's the question we actually asked a

554
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:06,559
different type of uh question can we

555
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:09,360
identify whether a person is intoxicated

556
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:12,240
by analyzing motion sensor data

557
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:14,240
obtained from an individual smartphone

558
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:15,679
and smartwatch

559
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:18,000
during a free gate now bear in mind

560
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,440
police officers

561
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:22,640
use a dedicated um

562
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:26,400
dedicated sobriety test in order to uh

563
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,320
to identify whether an individual is

564
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:31,840
intoxicated or not we want to do it with

565
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:32,640
from

566
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:33,840
a person

567
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:37,360
free gate and individual spray gate

568
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:38,640
okay so

569
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:40,480
we actually performed the case study in

570
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,159
order to answer this question and the

571
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:44,320
findings are described in the following

572
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,280
paper

573
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:47,600
which you can find easily online it's

574
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,120
called the age of testifying wearable

575
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:51,200
devices the case of intoxication

576
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:53,520
detection it was ordered by myself

577
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,520
professor leo okay and professor yuval

578
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:58,480
alovich

579
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:00,400
now the first one with the actual the

580
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:03,200
first thing that we actually uh did is

581
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:05,840
uh we conducted an experiment uh the

582
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:07,840
experiment took place at three different

583
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:08,720
bars

584
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:11,120
uh fairly individual participated in the

585
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:14,480
experiment and each individual was asked

586
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:16,559
to walk twice with the smart watch in a

587
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:20,159
smartphone for 16 seconds well only 8

588
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:22,880
seconds of the motion sensor data

589
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:24,880
was used

590
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:27,039
now the first work

591
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:28,960
took place before the individual started

592
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:30,000
to drink

593
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,919
and the second work took place after the

594
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:33,919
individual completed the drink

595
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:36,400
and the second time we also measured the

596
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,320
breath alcohol concentration level of

597
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:40,720
each of the participants with

598
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:42,799
a professional breathalyzer

599
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:44,640
now for each individual we extracted two

600
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,240
feature vectors

601
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:48,000
one vector was extracted from the data

602
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,679
obtained before the individual started

603
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:50,799
to drink

604
00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:52,480
the second vector was extracted from the

605
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:54,240
data obtained after the individual

606
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:56,559
completed ring

607
00:22:56,559 --> 00:22:58,960
and the vectors consist of the exact

608
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,799
same features which are the statistical

609
00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:03,440
features distribution in the time domain

610
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:05,280
distribution in the frequency domain and

611
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:08,640
known gate features

612
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,080
now also we subtracted for each

613
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,679
individual we subtracted the values of

614
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:13,520
the second vector from the first vector

615
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:16,480
and created the vector of differences

616
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,080
we labeled the vector of differences

617
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:19,679
with the breath alcohol concentration

618
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:21,360
sample that was taken

619
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:23,440
from the breathalyzer

620
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:26,159
and we ended up with 30 vectors one for

621
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:28,320
each participant that indicate the

622
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:30,720
difference in a person's free gate

623
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:33,120
labeled by the

624
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:37,479
breath alcohol concentration level

625
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:39,520
now let's

626
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,120
let's understand the results now we

627
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:43,039
examine whether an individual

628
00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:44,960
intoxication level can be determined for

629
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:47,600
various block levels

630
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:49,360
and we compare the results of two

631
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:50,960
machine learning algorithms which are

632
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,720
the gradient boosting classifier and the

633
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:54,640
adaboost classifier

634
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:56,799
now you can see the roc graphs on the

635
00:23:56,799 --> 00:23:59,039
right on the right side and we found

636
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:01,120
that our models can identify intoxicated

637
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:02,320
individual

638
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:04,240
with the bref alcohol concentration

639
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:05,360
level

640
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:08,400
greater than 220 with an area under

641
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:12,200
curve of 0.91

642
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:14,320
however

643
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:17,039
the models aren't perfect

644
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:19,120
uh they each have false positive and

645
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:21,840
false negative detections

646
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:23,840
and in some cases we cannot tolerate a

647
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:25,919
specific type of mistake and we want to

648
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:28,159
evaluate the modest performance with

649
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:31,520
respect to various policies

650
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:32,880
so

651
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:34,480
here's the question is it possible to

652
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:37,039
tune the model to detect all intoxicated

653
00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:39,679
subjects so we won't miss any

654
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:41,760
intoxicated individual

655
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:44,400
so actually this can be done by setting

656
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:48,080
the models to positive rate at one and

657
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:51,039
analyzing how this uh policy affected

658
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:53,279
the false positive rate basically how

659
00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:55,200
many sovereign individuals are

660
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:58,240
misdetected as a result of applying this

661
00:24:58,240 --> 00:24:59,279
policy

662
00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:01,039
now in general as you can see in the

663
00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:03,520
table on the right side we found that

664
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:05,679
the false positive rate remains very low

665
00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:08,960
when uh we are looking of on bref

666
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:10,559
alcohol concentration levels which are

667
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:14,279
greater than 220.

668
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:16,320
now here's another question is it

669
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:17,919
possible to tune the model so all

670
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:20,080
individuals detected as intoxicated by

671
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:22,880
the models are actually intoxicated

672
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:23,760
now

673
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:25,440
again the answer is yes and this can be

674
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,360
accomplished by setting the model's

675
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:29,440
false positive rate at zero

676
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:32,400
and analyzing how this uh policy

677
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:34,559
affected the two positive rate basically

678
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:36,960
how many intoxicated individuals

679
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:38,240
are missed

680
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:38,960
as

681
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:41,679
as a result of deploying this policy now

682
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:43,679
in general you can see that this policy

683
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:46,720
can result in many errors where only

684
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:48,159
uh about

685
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:51,440
60 uh percent of uh your uh

686
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:54,559
of your of the intoxicated individuals

687
00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:56,640
are detected as

688
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:59,360
intoxicated while in some cases 40

689
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:01,919
percent and even 50 percent of uh the

690
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:04,080
individuals are are

691
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:05,840
missed by this model i'll consider the

692
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:08,320
sobel

693
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:12,080
okay so we are about to uh discuss about

694
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:15,120
the takeaways from this talk and

695
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:16,799
the first takeaway is that the primary

696
00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:19,120
risk that motion sensor currently pose

697
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:21,520
is to individuals privacy rather than

698
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:24,720
posing a threat to a device security and

699
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:26,720
many people don't consider data from

700
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:29,440
motion sensors at privacy risk however

701
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:31,520
attackers can derive various insights

702
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:34,320
about users by analyzing motion sensor

703
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:35,279
data

704
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:36,960
and this can be done for recovering

705
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:39,120
speech for key logging

706
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:40,720
to detect whether an individual is

707
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:43,679
intoxicated and also is an alternative

708
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:46,159
way to locate a user

709
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:48,960
without any gps measurement and also for

710
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:52,000
user identification

711
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,080
now currently the most practical way to

712
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:56,320
obtain motion sensor data requires the

713
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:58,720
attacker to install an application on an

714
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:01,279
iot device in order to obtain motion

715
00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:03,840
sensor data

716
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:06,159
however we expect that ongoing external

717
00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:08,640
changes like the adoption of 5g an

718
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,320
increased commercial interest in motion

719
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:13,360
sensor data will result in increased

720
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:15,760
data collection by third parties and as

721
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:17,600
a result we believe that in the near

722
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:20,399
future obtaining motion sensor data via

723
00:27:20,399 --> 00:27:22,640
third parties will become more practical

724
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:25,279
than installing a malicious application

725
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:27,039
so we believe that the common threat

726
00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:29,520
model to obtain motion sensor data is

727
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:31,120
about to be changed

728
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:32,720
in the near future due to external

729
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:34,960
changes

730
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:36,640
now another interesting takeaway is that

731
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:39,039
consider our understanding about the

732
00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:41,200
privacy risks associated with motion

733
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:43,840
sensor data we are quite surprised that

734
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:45,600
such data

735
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:47,520
can be obtained without any user

736
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:48,399
permission

737
00:27:48,399 --> 00:27:50,320
and these are free snapshots that are

738
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:53,279
taken from my smartphone now you can see

739
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:55,919
uh one good application that i usually

740
00:27:55,919 --> 00:27:58,720
use which called android sensor you can

741
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:00,240
see how data from accelerometer and

742
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:02,399
gyroscope is presented by this

743
00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:04,799
application however no permission is

744
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:07,679
granted to sample motion sensor data by

745
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:10,720
this application at all

746
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:11,840
now

747
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:13,520
a user's motion

748
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:15,679
basically it means that a user's motion

749
00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:18,080
sensor data might be used for recovering

750
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:23,039
speech and the user won't suspect at all

751
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:24,880
now the last point i want you to think

752
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:27,520
of is that throughout the entire talk we

753
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:30,240
consider the fact that deriving insights

754
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:32,880
about a user by analyzing the collected

755
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:35,279
motion sensor data is a violation of the

756
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:38,159
user's privacy and this is true from a

757
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:40,000
user's perspective

758
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:40,799
now

759
00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:42,880
what about the bigger picture

760
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,640
so

761
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:46,000
in the last few years in a few

762
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,640
well-known cases a user's motion sensor

763
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:51,039
data was used to

764
00:28:51,039 --> 00:28:54,240
contradict a husband report of his wife

765
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:56,960
time of death which completely changed

766
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:58,480
the cause of the investigation by

767
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:01,200
enabling the police to prove that

768
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:02,559
the

769
00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:04,080
the wife was walking

770
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:05,919
around an hour after her husband told

771
00:29:05,919 --> 00:29:09,279
the police she was shot by an invader

772
00:29:09,279 --> 00:29:10,960
and as a result

773
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:13,679
the police

774
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:16,320
arrested this man for murdering his own

775
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:18,559
wife

776
00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:19,679
in another

777
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:22,880
well-known and famous case

778
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:25,360
this data was used to charge a woman

779
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:28,640
with false reporting after a fitbit

780
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:31,440
contradicted her rape claim by proving

781
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:34,240
that she was actually walking around at

782
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:38,320
the time in question and

783
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:40,240
the last takeaway that i want you to

784
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:42,000
think of or to take from this talk is

785
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,760
that the answer to the question of

786
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:45,919
whether we want to allow a party to

787
00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:47,919
analyze an individual's motion sensor

788
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:51,679
data depends on the use case in some use

789
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:52,720
cases

790
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:55,440
this data can help the police to solve

791
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:58,080
many crimes

792
00:29:58,480 --> 00:29:59,679
now i would like to thank you for

793
00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:01,440
attending my talk

794
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:03,679
and

795
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:08,120
let's start the session of the q a

796
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:11,279
you
