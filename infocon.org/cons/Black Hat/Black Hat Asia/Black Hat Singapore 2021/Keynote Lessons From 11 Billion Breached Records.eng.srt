2
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:17,920
well thank you very much everyone for

3
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:19,199
joining me at

4
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:22,560
blackhat asia it is uh it is somewhat

5
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:23,039
different

6
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:26,080
to previous years isn't it i still

7
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:28,080
fortunately have many fond memories of

8
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:29,679
attending conferences

9
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:31,679
in person but frankly many new fond

10
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:32,800
memories of

11
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:34,559
running events like this and still being

12
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:36,239
able to interact with people online

13
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:38,399
and one thing that definitely hasn't

14
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:39,680
changed

15
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:43,840
pre and post current

16
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:47,280
is data breaches and i have been

17
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:48,800
spending a lot of time

18
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,559
both over the last year and a bit and

19
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:51,760
for many years before that thinking

20
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:53,440
about data breaches and

21
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:55,120
what i thought i'd try and share with

22
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:56,239
everyone today is just some of the

23
00:00:56,239 --> 00:00:57,120
things that

24
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:59,760
i've been seeing in the industry

25
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:00,800
particularly

26
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:03,920
with the last 11 billion or so records

27
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:05,360
worth of breach data that i've been

28
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:06,720
dealing with

29
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,080
and of course when i talk about data

30
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:10,000
breaches i'm largely talking about have

31
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,600
i been pwned

32
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:15,040
and this is a a fun little project

33
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,799
can i still say fun can i still say

34
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:18,400
little this is

35
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:21,439
still a pet project which is intended to

36
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:23,680
index data breaches and make them

37
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,520
searchable by people

38
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:26,960
and i'm always a little bit cautious

39
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:29,200
when i set an expectation for a talk

40
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,400
around a title like

41
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,560
11 billion breached records because for

42
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,720
all i know between the time i propose 11

43
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,079
billion in the time i actually do the

44
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:37,439
talk it's now

45
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:40,000
12 billion or something like that but it

46
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,280
has stuck at 11

47
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,000
point something billion since i proposed

48
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,360
the talk and then

49
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:48,159
finally join you here today and it's

50
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:50,159
across many many hundreds of individual

51
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:52,159
data breaches

52
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:54,079
and of course there is pretty much an

53
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:56,240
endless flow of data that comes into

54
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:58,320
havo bamponned

55
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,960
and i didn't really expect that when i

56
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,719
began the project in fact when i began

57
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:04,719
the project it started out

58
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:07,920
very small it started out back in 2013.

59
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,239
with this launch tweet

60
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:12,480
and i tweeted this and i thought this

61
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,160
would be fun some of my mates will use

62
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,520
this

63
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,800
they'll go to have i been phone they'll

64
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,160
plug their email address in they'll get

65
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:19,440
some results this will keep me

66
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,560
entertained

67
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:23,840
for a little while not everyone was

68
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,599
convinced there were a few suspicious

69
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:27,680
people out there what if i was just

70
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:30,080
harvesting addresses

71
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,000
now when i started having pain i started

72
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,760
with about 155

73
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:36,000
million records so even back then and of

74
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,599
course that's very very small by today's

75
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:38,239
standards

76
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:40,959
but even back then i was thinking i

77
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:42,160
don't need to harvest

78
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,560
your email addresses i've got 155

79
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:45,760
million of them already

80
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:48,239
if i was to be a nefarious person and do

81
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:49,280
something nasty with them which of

82
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,000
course i'm not

83
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,599
and i i haven't no i intend to

84
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:55,599
but i understand the suspicion people

85
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:57,599
were like so i just go to

86
00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:00,560
your site and plug in my email address

87
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,720
and i trust you with it

88
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,480
i always thought that was a funny

89
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:05,680
premise to make because i'm like well

90
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,440
you trusted adobe with it now here we

91
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,200
are

92
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,840
but i get the suspicion and what i've

93
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,680
found particularly fascinating

94
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,319
over the last what are we at now seven

95
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:18,000
and a bit years

96
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,720
is just the way this thing has grown and

97
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,400
the places has taken me

98
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,400
because again like this is a pet project

99
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,599
it's something i did

100
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:28,239
for fun for community goodwill you know

101
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:30,560
some people find it useful

102
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:33,040
but it's taken me to some very

103
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,879
unexpected places and i think probably

104
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:35,599
the

105
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:37,599
that the real sort of penny drop moment

106
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:39,280
for me was when i ended up

107
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:42,080
here in congress in the us in washington

108
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,440
dc

109
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,879
and in fact when i got asked to go to

110
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:48,000
congress i said to him it's like

111
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,680
you know i'm australian right are you

112
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,360
sure you want me to go to the other side

113
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,640
of the world

114
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:55,360
and testify about the impact of data

115
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:55,920
breaches

116
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:58,640
on knowledge based authentication and

117
00:03:58,640 --> 00:03:59,360
they're like yeah

118
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,080
now it'll be cool you should come and i

119
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,840
was excited

120
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,319
but i was worried too because i didn't

121
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:08,239
have any clothes i mean this is me right

122
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:10,239
this is normal in fact i'm in australia

123
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:12,840
now which means i'm dressed in board

124
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,640
shorts

125
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,079
i've already revealed more than people

126
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:18,720
expected to in this talk

127
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,040
but this is normal right like i i go

128
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,560
here and then i go down and i get in the

129
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,240
water and i do my normal australia

130
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,960
gold coasty things so everything you see

131
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,320
in this picture

132
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,400
i had to go and buy in terms of clothing

133
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:31,520
like i had to buy

134
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:36,080
the suit the shirt the tie

135
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,479
everything but you might be gathering

136
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:39,759
also like i don't like to take things

137
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:41,199
too seriously like this has got to be a

138
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:42,080
little bit of fun

139
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:45,280
as well so i put out a tweet and i said

140
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,479
look uh

141
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:48,320
has anyone got some socks then i've got

142
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,520
some cool socks

143
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:53,600
that i can wear to congress and sophos

144
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,160
sent me some over i'm wearing the socks

145
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,360
in this picture and i

146
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:00,400
i think you'd all agree i'm the best

147
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,479
equipped socks in the photo here

148
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:04,320
alongside my

149
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,400
my fellow expert witnesses who are

150
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,680
testifying

151
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:10,080
and these socks if we take a closer look

152
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,080
at them look like this

153
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,919
we've got uh bearded coda dude here for

154
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:16,160
those about to code we salute you

155
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,840
and i thought oh this will be this would

156
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:20,479
be a bit of a laugh bit of fun

157
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:22,479
and i think sort of the best

158
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:24,080
illustration like just how far have i

159
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,360

160
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,520
weird things got is not only was i there

163
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,160
but there are photographers everywhere

164
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,360

00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,440
that often

172
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,440
and it keeps going to these lofty

173
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,520
heights and i've told this story before

174
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:56,880
but here's another story i'm not told

175
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,479
until today because this is only brand

176
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:01,599
new as of last week

177
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:05,199
the fbi is now sending data for ever

178
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:07,360
been prone how weird is that

179
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:10,560
not just the fbi but the dutch national

180
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:13,479
high technical crimes unit they're in

181
00:06:13,479 --> 00:06:14,800
htcu

182
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,360
and even the german federal criminal

183
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,880
police office their bka

184
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:21,039
is sending data that haven't been

185
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:22,400
painted in this case it came from the

186
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,560
emmett botnet

187
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:27,039
sending data so that it is searchable by

188
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:28,720
other people

189
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:31,680
because somehow this service became

190
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,360
useful enough that

191
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,360
law enforcement agencies with acronyms

192
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,400
and logos like this

193
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:39,840
are willing to send this information in

194
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:42,080
now this is fantastic because we can do

195
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,199
positive things

196
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:44,960
with data after bad things happen in

197
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,240
fact there's always been the motto of

198
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,840
have i been parent it's like let's do

199
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:51,280
good things after bad things happen

200
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,639
now of course when we talk about bad

201
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:54,160
things we are talking about hackers and

202
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,440
i think it's very important that we take

203
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,440
a moment to reflect

204
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:00,160
on who these hackers are who is the

205
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,479
adversary that we need to concern

206
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:04,000
ourselves with

207
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,080
and i want to familiarize ourselves a

208
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:08,319
little bit with the hackers

209
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:10,240
so when did a google search and i found

210
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,319
some

211
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:14,720
now this is probably very familiar

212
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,479
imagery to everybody

213
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:19,039
we see this all over the press we see it

214
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:22,319
all over security company brochures

215
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:24,000
and it tells us many interesting things

216
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,440
about hackers number one they like

217
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,120
hoodies now i'm sure everybody

218
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:29,199
is aware of this already we have seen

219
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:31,039
the hoodie hacker

220
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:34,240
many times before

221
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:37,199
number two they're like green you'll see

222
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:38,960
this is a recurring theme it's like over

223
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,720
and over again

224
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:41,919
there's a hacker thing ah there's a

225
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:44,639
green screen there

226
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:46,160
they're like binary too very into the

227
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:48,720
binary the hackers

228
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,879
and i think what is fascinating about

229
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:51,759
this is

230
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:55,360
that the imagery here is chosen to

231
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:55,919
create

232
00:07:55,919 --> 00:08:00,400
an emotion it is chosen to make people

233
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,720
fearful because it's all scary right

234
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:03,599
look at it it's all

235
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:04,960
dark themes and things like this can't

236
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,240
quite see their face it's hidden in the

237
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,560
shadows of the hood

238
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:11,199
this plays into the hand of the media

239
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:12,560
because everything the media puts out

240
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,919
there is scary or is the last time you

241
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:15,120
went and opened the front page of the

242
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,639
newspaper and was happy

243
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:18,639
particularly lately like the scary

244
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:19,840
things that sell

245
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:23,919
news it's also scary things that sell

246
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:26,479
security things and you see as i

247
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:27,919
mentioned before many companies selling

248
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:29,680
their security things based on imagery

249
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,520
like this

250
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,279
now i saw a really good example of this

251
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:34,559
a few years ago

252
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:38,000
and this to me just absolutely

253
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,479
nails the way the industry represents

254
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:41,599
cyber security

255
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:44,000
versus the reality now brace yourself

256
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,080
for this it's hilarious

257
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:49,279
so there is a product which was put out

258
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:49,839
there

259
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:51,920
as a little kickstarter from memory

260
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,360
little product called cujo

261
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:57,040
now you put the cujo in your home

262
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:00,080
no more hackers it's like magic and i've

263
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,320
got a video which explains how it works

264
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,839
and i've got a very very short clip of

265
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:05,200
the video here i want you to watch

266
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:08,399
this and listen very carefully to what's

267
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:09,360
going on

268
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,440
you may not know it but you probably

269
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,640
already didn't have

270
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,720
thousands of active attacks occur each

271
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,399
day

272
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:18,160
you may not know it but you've probably

273
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:21,519
already been hacked it is scary isn't it

274
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:22,959
now we know he's a hacker because he's

275
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:24,880
got a hoodie so yeah check he's also got

276
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:25,920
a green screen check

277
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:28,720
so everything here is so far ticking all

278
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:29,839
the boxes

279
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:33,040
of hacker-like behavior we are

280
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:36,160
appropriately scared

281
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:39,120
except when i watched this video for the

282
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,440
first time

283
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,920
and as the camera panned across his

284
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,200
screen

285
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:49,360
and i looked at it closely i'm like

286
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:52,560
there's a browser like why is he

287
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:55,600
in a browser with a green screen hacking

288
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,600
what is this magic i have to work this

289
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,200
out

290
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,200
and i did work it out and it is epic now

291
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,480
here's how it works i'm going to demo

292
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,160
this in real time what you do is you

293
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:06,000
grab yourself a browser

294
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,800
and you go to hackertyper.net this still

295
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,560
works today you can amaze your friends

296
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:11,839
and families with this

297
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:14,000
now once you get to hackatyper.net all

298
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,560
you do is you just bash the keyboard

299
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,160
and it literally hacks four you can do

300
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,360
it with one hand look at this it's

301
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,279
amazing

302
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:23,680
and this is exactly what is in the video

303
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,680
i went all csi on it i went and zoomed

304
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,680
and enhanced and i pulled out the text

305
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:30,839
that was in that video and it is from

306
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:32,079
hackertyper.net

307
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:34,160
so you've got a company here trying to

308
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:36,720
sell a security thing

309
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,959
based on a guy in a hoodie on hakka

310
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:39,920
typer.net

311
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:43,440
bashing the keyboard so see how that the

312
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:46,880
imagery of hackers and breaches

313
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:49,600
is very very carefully presented to

314
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,360
create this emotion in people and in

315
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,200
reality it's very very far from the

316
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,600
truth

317
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,120
let me give you an example of how far

318
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:59,440
from the truth it very often is

319
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,200
and let's uh let's have a little chat

320
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,519
about talk talk

321
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:07,120
now talk talk is a major british telco

322
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:09,839
and they got hacked in 2015. it was a

323
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:11,760
very serious incident they said it cost

324
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:12,000
them

325
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,040
77 million pounds

326
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:17,600
so by anyone's measure that is a lot of

327
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,600
money

328
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:22,000
now when this incident happened it of

329
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,920
course was in the press

330
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,279
and there was a statement from a

331
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:27,360
detective and i kid you're not what

332
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,800
you're about to say i have not made up

333
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,480
you will be able to take this phrase

334
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:31,920
plug it into google and you will find

335
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:32,959
the news story

336
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:36,399
this detective said we think we know who

337
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:38,000
it might be

338
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,839
we think it's russian islamic cyber

339
00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:42,079
jihadis

340
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:45,200
i was just looking at this guy

341
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:48,800
what like where do you get any of these

342
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,720
words from except for maybe cyber like

343
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:51,519
why

344
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:55,279
have you drawn this conclusion and

345
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:57,200
the only assertion i can make about this

346
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,800
is that they were trying to combine

347
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,240
words which they thought would make

348
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,680
people feel scared

349
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,440
that's the only thing i can think of

350
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,519
because it is a great headline isn't it

351
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:09,200
russian islamic cyber jihadis

352
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:13,920
now in reality it was actually this guy

353
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:16,320
and it is difficult to tell whether he's

354
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,079
wearing a hoodie or not

355
00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:20,079
in this shot because his face is

356
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:22,000
obfuscated

357
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,920
now why is his face on for skater well

358
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:26,160
because it's a child it's a 17 year old

359
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,480
kid a 17 year old kid

360
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,720
who's managed to do tens of millions of

361
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:33,360
pounds of damage

362
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:38,079
to a major telco how is this possible

363
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:41,360
how do we have this massive

364
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:44,240
leverage where we can take someone who

365
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,160
is a child

366
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,600
with very little experience and

367
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,279
sophistication

368
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:51,279
and leverage that little ability they

369
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:53,600
have to do 77 million pounds worth of

370
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:54,639
damage

371
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:58,160
to an organization like talk talk

372
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:01,360
now they do take these things seriously

373
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,079
in the uk

374
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:05,120
they took his iphone away which

375
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,560
which actually is probably about the

376
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:08,320
most serious thing that can happen to a

377
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,399
17 year old child that it would

378
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:11,920
basically feel like the end of their

379
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:14,880
life got probation for a year as well no

380
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:15,760
more hacking stuff

381
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:18,480
for a year couldn't do it plus he didn't

382
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:21,200
have his iphone anyway

383
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:24,480
but compare she's always listening

384
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:25,920
we're worried about all the cyber things

385
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:26,800
and all the things that might be

386
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,160
listening and here i've got this little

387
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,760
super computer on my wrist which is

388
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:31,360
listening to everything i say and then

389
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,279
interjecting

390
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:36,399
but iot is awesome really so isn't it

391
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:38,000
interesting though how we have this

392
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,920
perception in this image

393
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,600
of infosec and it's all green screens

394
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,519
and hoodies and things like this

395
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:45,839
and then we have the reality which is a

396
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:47,279
child

397
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:49,680
now time and time again we're seeing

398
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:51,040
infosec incidents

399
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:54,399
happen because the fruit is so low

400
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:55,279
hanging

401
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:56,320
now i'll give you an example of what i

402
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,560
mean by this

403
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,160
australian red cross blood service this

404
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,920
was 2016.

405
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,920
and someone reached out to me and they

406
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:05,120
said

407
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:09,120
hey i've got donateblood.com.eu database

408
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:11,920
and it contains information about 1.3

409
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:14,639
million australians

410
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:17,519
this is what the data looks like now

411
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:18,399
this is a

412
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:20,720
typical set of columns that would be in

413
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,240
a data breach first name last name

414
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:23,440
gender this sort of thing and for the

415
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:27,040
most part all of this is very usual

416
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:29,839
until you get down to blood type and

417
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:31,279
blood type is not something that you

418
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:33,360
normally see in a data breach

419
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:37,760
and i was curious about this because

420
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,199
not only do we not see it but i'm not

421
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:41,120
sure if it's a problem or not and the

422
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,399
reason i'm not sure it's a problem is

423
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:42,800
because

424
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,320
on the one hand it's like okay this is

425
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,000
health data and health data is a very

426
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,199
particular

427
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:49,839
kind of data it is more sensitive than

428
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:51,360
let's say someone's email address their

429
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:52,800
phone number

430
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,320
but on the other hand what do you do

431
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,920
with it like if someone gets my blood

432
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:56,720
type

433
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,079
it's not that they're going to ransom me

434
00:14:58,079 --> 00:14:59,839
over it's like hey i see you're a b

435
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:00,480
positive

436
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:01,920
give us bitcoin as i know that's not

437
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,680
going to happen

438
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:06,959
but it does feel uncomfortable

439
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:08,880
he didn't know if it contained passwords

440
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,079
or rather he said it didn't he didn't

441
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:11,680
know if i wanted it

442
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:13,040
which doesn't bother me because i don't

443
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,320
care if there's passwords or not i just

444
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,920
want to be able to answer the question

445
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:16,480
have i

446
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:19,279
been pwned

447
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,199
and i wanted to take this seriously

448
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:23,360
because as you can see he's got a

449
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:25,680
hoodie so he's obviously a hacker the

450
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:26,399
guy's

451
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:29,440
probably got something quite valuable so

452
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:30,639
i said uh

453
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:33,839
yeah look i'd be interested in this i've

454
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:35,920
donated blood before i might be in there

455
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:37,279
myself

456
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:38,839
and he's like yep yeah he's your

457
00:15:38,839 --> 00:15:40,399
daughter

458
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:44,480
and i wasn't happy with that um

459
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:47,120
these are honest candid discussions that

460
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,560
i've had with hackers

461
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:50,320
and this is generally my reaction when i

462
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,759
find myself in a new data breach i've

463
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:55,680
been in have i been phoned 25 times now

464
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,360
but what was interesting here is the guy

465
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:00,399
said he was just scanning ips

466
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:02,480
and that's how he found it and he wasn't

467
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:05,360
doing this for bad purposes

468
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:08,000
and what he ultimately located was a

469
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,800
file like this

470
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:12,480
so all he did is he went to an ip

471
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,000
address and he knocked on the door

472
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,600
report 80 said hey

473
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,120
is there a directory listing here yeah

474
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,320
there's a directory listing are there

475
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,240
any dot sql files yeah there's a dot sql

476
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:20,880
file

477
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:24,000
here you go and this is how he found

478
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,040
the data and so often the data breaches

479
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:29,519
which end up in have i been puned

480
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:31,440
have literally just come from

481
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:32,959
organizations

482
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:35,199
backing up their databases to publicly

483
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:38,320
accessible locations

484
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,079
now something else is really fascinating

485
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:41,519
about this now i want to touch for a

486
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:42,480
moment on

487
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,399
how i gave my data to the red cross

488
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:46,240
because i hear people often say these

489
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,600
days they're like

490
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,600
you should minimize your data footprint

491
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,440
by not entering any information into

492
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,560
websites

493
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,240
as though you have some choice oh i mean

494
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,480
look okay you've got a degree of choice

495
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:58,399
but the idea of just avoiding websites

496
00:16:58,399 --> 00:16:59,920
altogether and avoiding handing

497
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:02,320
information over to those sites

498
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:05,039
really doesn't fly and the situation

499
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:06,559
with red cross

500
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:08,480
is that i never entered my data into a

501
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,400
website

502
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,559
i went to a blood van just like this one

503
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:13,760
just here so

504
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:15,439
the blood van came around to work one

505
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:17,199
day i remember when this was or still in

506
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:19,919
the corporate world they came on site

507
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:21,280
and the van was there and i went into

508
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:22,480
the van and they gave me a piece of

509
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:24,000
paper and i filled out

510
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,439
the information that you saw on the

511
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:27,280
previous screen

512
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:30,799
somebody else digitized this

513
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:32,559
and i think the important lesson here is

514
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:35,280
that regardless of how hard you might

515
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,679
try to avoid handing your data over in

516
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:39,679
digital format

517
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:41,440
it's kind of all over the place anyway

518
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,440
because we have lives

519
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,039
like we go out and we do things and

520
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:46,960
sometimes those things that we do

521
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:50,640
require us to hand over information

522
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,720
now the most sensitive part of that

523
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,559
entire data breach was the eligibility

524
00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:56,320
criteria

525
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,799
and out of those eligibility criteria

526
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:00,160
one of the questions

527
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:02,799
was this one in the last 12 months have

528
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:03,919
you engaged in at

529
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:07,440
risk sexual behavior

530
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:09,120
which was a very polite way of asking if

531
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:11,760
you'd slept with a prostitute

532
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:13,919
this is a perfectly valid question for

533
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:15,120
people donating

534
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:18,480
blood but imagine having that data

535
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:19,679
leaked

536
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:21,600
so not only are we leaking large amounts

537
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,280
of data and large amounts of data which

538
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:25,039
we may never have provided in digital

539
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:25,840
format

540
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:29,280
but we're leaking extremely personal

541
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:32,879
sensitive data attributes

542
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:34,320
now one of the other things that we're

543
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:37,600
leaking time and time again is passwords

544
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:40,880
and passwords have become for many

545
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:42,480
security professionals the bane of their

546
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,240
existence am i right

547
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:46,799
dealing with the problems that come from

548
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:48,480
passwords

549
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:51,600
now passwords began back here

550
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,039
in the 60s at least this is where they

551
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:54,880
began on computer systems i imagine that

552
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,320
we had passwords for

553
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:59,760
millennia beforehand i'm picturing

554
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,840
a bug's bunny cartoon and the guard

555
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,280
asking what the password is before bugs

556
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:05,120
is allowed into the cave but much a lot

557
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:05,600
longer

558
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:08,000
after that we then had passwords on

559
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,520
computer systems

560
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:14,240
and it began here at mit in the 60s

561
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:15,919
and passwords worked in a very simple

562
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:17,280
fashion and it's exactly the way they

563
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:18,799
still work today

564
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:20,559
you have two strings in your head a

565
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:21,840
username and a password those two

566
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:23,520
strings also exist in the system that

567
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:25,120
you're authenticating to

568
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:26,400
if the strings in your head match the

569
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,400
strings in the system you are you

570
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:31,440
and you get to log on

571
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:33,679
but think about the risk factors back

572
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:36,320
here in the sixties

573
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:37,679
first of all for someone to log onto

574
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:38,880
your account they had to get into this

575
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:39,679
room

576
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:42,000
this entire room of computer because

577
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,360
this was back in the day where it took

578
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:46,640
an entire room to fit a computer

579
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,960
you had to have sophisticated knowledge

580
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:50,720
i got no idea what i'd do if i ended up

581
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,240
in that room

582
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:55,600
like is it is it tapes is it punch cards

583
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,679
like which knob do i turn first like i

584
00:19:57,679 --> 00:19:59,360
do not know how that thing works and

585
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:01,600
very very few people did

586
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:04,159
so the risks we had with someone

587
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:06,640
misusing a password then

588
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,320
are fundamentally different to today yet

589
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:09,679
they still work

590
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:12,960
in precisely the same way fast forward a

591
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,799
bit let's go forward a couple of decades

592
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:16,559
we get to the 80s

593
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:18,720
now when we're in the 80s we're now

594
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,880
starting to get personal computers

595
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,720
in the home and not only personal

596
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:23,919
computers in the home but personal

597
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:25,919
computers that can dial up to central

598
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:27,200
locations

599
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:30,960
like the prestel now the prestar went

600
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,159
out to about a total of

601
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:33,840
somewhere in the order of 90 000 people

602
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:35,360
90 000 people got one of these

603
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:38,080
in their home and they could now start

604
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:41,840
dialing into a central location

605
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:44,960
and authenticating to a server

606
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,320
there's a little video clip here i'm

607
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,240
going to play this is bbc back in the

608
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:49,280
mid 80s

609
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:52,240
where this guy shows how to authenticate

610
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:53,039
watch

611
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:56,080
very carefully at what he does

612
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,600
the impressive computer is now asking me

613
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,480
to enter my own personal password

614
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:04,000
which i have did you get that

615
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,200
you see what his password was let's zoom

616
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,559
and enhance and take a closer look at

617
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:10,720
this

618
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:17,200
right it's one two three four good old

619
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,159
trusty

620
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:21,679
sequential numeric password

621
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:24,320
why do people do this well they do it

622
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:25,679
because the password is a barrier to

623
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:27,360
entry it is something which is between

624
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:29,360
them and the thing that they are there

625
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:31,440
to do he just wants to do

626
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,039
whatever it was he used to do with the

627
00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:34,799
connected computer in the 80s

628
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:36,799
and this password is in the way what's

629
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:38,000
the fastest way i can get it out of the

630
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:38,880
way

631
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,080
i make it something that's easy to

632
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:42,720
remember and easy to type

633
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,480
you could get away with that more in the

634
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:46,720
60s back in mit

635
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:48,400
it's harder to get away with it in the

636
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,240
80s where now we've got

637
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:51,760
tens of thousands of people all

638
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:54,240
connected to this remote network

639
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:56,000
fast forward another couple of decades

640
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,559
into the naughties and it's harder again

641
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:02,000
because now we've got internet we've got

642
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,280
millions of websites we've got billions

643
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:08,159
of people using them and now we've got a

644
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:09,679
problem

645
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:10,960
the problem is password's too

646
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:13,360
predictable so what we as an industry

647
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:14,880
did is we said

648
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:16,159
we're going to come up with password

649
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:18,720
complexity criteria now i have some file

650
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,000
footage here

651
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,480
of someone trying to create a password

652
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:24,720
on a website in the 2000s this is bob

653
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,159
now bob's at his computer and the

654
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:27,600
website is saying in order for you to

655
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,120
register bob you will need to create a

656
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,159
password that's got

657
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:32,000
at least one lowercase character at

658
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,600
least one uppercase character

659
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,200
you've got to have at least one number

660
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,520
you've got to have at least one

661
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:38,240
non-alphanumeric character

662
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:39,600
it's got to be at least eight characters

663
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,760
long and it can't be any of the last

664
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:44,240
five passwords that you've used before

665
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:47,200
and bob is losing his freaking mind

666
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,559
because now

667
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:51,840
creating passwords is painful and we

668
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:52,640
have all been bob

669
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:54,240
we have all been here we have all been

670
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:56,240
to a website that does precisely this

671
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:58,000
well one of my pet hates websites that

672
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,520
say your password is too strong please

673
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:00,960
make it shorter or take out some of the

674
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,080
special characters

675
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:03,440
and then i'm there just going well

676
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:05,360
aren't all characters special like

677
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:06,640
why do we have this character

678
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:09,520
discrimination thing

679
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:11,120
so what do people do what do people do

680
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:12,400
when they're faced with password

681
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:14,720
complexity criteria

682
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:17,120
well they create passwords which will

683
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:18,960
meet the complexity criteria passwords

684
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:20,320
just like this

685
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:24,320
and this is a good password

686
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:26,159
except you're looking at it and going no

687
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:28,960
no no this is not good

688
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:31,919
but bear with me uppercase lowercase

689
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:32,400
number

690
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,799
non-alphanumeric and this is actually 15

691
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:36,320
characters long too like by any

692
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:38,320
reasonable measure this is a good

693
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:40,559
password

694
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:42,400
except you know that it's not a good

695
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,080
password because you are seeing

696
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:46,080
patterns and you are seeing something

697
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:48,400
that is predictable you're seeing

698
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:51,279
english words that you recognize and

699
00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:54,799
you're seeing character substitution

700
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:56,960
but you could almost certainly create

701
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:59,039
this password at your place of work

702
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:02,240
today and if you did

703
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:05,039
what would happen in 90 days from now

704
00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:06,640
you would be prompted to change it

705
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:08,240
because a hacker might have gotten your

706
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:09,919
password

707
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:13,440
so what do you do in 90 days well

708
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:16,720
you do this and this is very scalable

709
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:18,000
because you can just keep going

710
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,720
and going and going and the beautiful

711
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,320
thing about this is that you can take

712
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:22,720
the

713
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:24,159
number that is on the end of your work

714
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:25,600
password right now i know you have one

715
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:26,480
we all do it

716
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:28,080
and you can divide that by four and

717
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:29,120
that's how many years you've been at the

718
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:29,760
company

719
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:33,679
i'll get up to 23 in my last company

720
00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:36,559
now we're doing this virtual so i can't

721
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:37,919
see your reaction but i know how you're

722
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:39,360
reacting because i've done this enough

723
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:41,200
times in person where i've looked at the

724
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,320
audience

725
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:44,720
and seen how uneasy everyone gets and

726
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:46,080
often i'll say to people okay

727
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,919
you get a website and you're trying to

728
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:49,279
create a password and you're using that

729
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:51,039
same terrible lowercase password use

730
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:51,760
every else

731
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:53,600
and the website says you must have at

732
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:55,120
least one uppercase character what do

733
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:56,320
you do

734
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:57,760
and everyone's looking at the person

735
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:59,760
next to them and eventually someone says

736
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:00,960
well you just capitalized the first

737
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:01,600
letter

738
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:04,400
and everyone laughs nervously because

739
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:06,320
they all know they do it

740
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:08,240
all right you have at least one number

741
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,159
what do you do and someone else is like

742
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:12,480
well you you put a one at the end and

743
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:15,200
it's the nervous laughter again

744
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:16,480
what about the non-alphanumeric

745
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:18,799
character exclamation mark at the end

746
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:20,240
and everyone is still nervous and

747
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:21,360
laughing at

748
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:22,480
each other and then of course you get to

749
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:24,080
the whole bit about password rotation

750
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:25,760
and they're just like you just

751
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:28,799
increment the number

752
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:31,840
if we all know this don't you think that

753
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:33,840
hackers also know this like they have

754
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:35,520
worked this out they're

755
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:39,360
quite clever so part of the problem is

756
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:40,559
is that when we

757
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:42,640
mandate arbitrary password complexity

758
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:44,320
criteria like this

759
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:47,440
we inevitably find that people follow

760
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:49,520
very predictable patterns

761
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:51,600
and we also find that people take

762
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:54,080
shortcuts to memorizing the password and

763
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:56,799
i'll give you a good example of this

764
00:25:56,799 --> 00:25:58,640
this black here is running the hawaiian

765
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,159
emergency response center and if you

766
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:02,080
remember a couple of years ago

767
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:04,080
a whole bunch of people in hawaii

768
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:05,279
suddenly got alerts

769
00:26:05,279 --> 00:26:07,600
to their mobile devices saying there are

770
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:08,320
missiles

771
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:10,480
coming and it was very stressful

772
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:12,880
understandably for people there

773
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,480
and it was a false alarm and then the

774
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:16,000
news went in and they interviewed this

775
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,520
guy and they're like okay you know what

776
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:19,200
happened and he explained it and

777
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:21,039
there's this photo of him here standing

778
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:22,480
in front of his

779
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:25,200
his sock here with all these uh monitors

780
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:25,600
and

781
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:27,120
screens and things and there's something

782
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:28,960
very alarming

783
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:33,039
down here on one of these screens

784
00:26:33,039 --> 00:26:35,120
they're still running internet explorer

785
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:36,640
oh and he'd also pasted his password on

786
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:39,120
a post-it note just beneath that

787
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:42,640
and this again demonstrates the problem

788
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:45,039
where people will take shortcuts to

789
00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:48,080
circumvent the security controls

790
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:49,600
so as an industry we're now starting to

791
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:52,640
say well maybe we need to recognize that

792
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:53,840
humans are not just like

793
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:56,320
little automated random number

794
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:58,240
generators that have password managers

795
00:26:58,240 --> 00:26:59,679
in their head that can create strong

796
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:01,039
unique passwords and remember them all

797
00:27:01,039 --> 00:27:04,000
humans don't really work that way

798
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,840
so let's recognize that some of the

799
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:09,039
things we're doing don't work so well

800
00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:12,640
so an example of this nist has said

801
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:14,880
what we really should do instead of this

802
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:17,279
arbitrary complexity criteria

803
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:19,200
is we should make sure that verifiers do

804
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:21,120
not impose composition rules

805
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:24,320
for memorized secrets so stop this stuff

806
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:25,600
about uppercase and lowercase people

807
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:27,919
will do things that are very predictable

808
00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:31,520
the ncsc in the uk has said look on the

809
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:32,000
whole

810
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,640
rotation thing you really should only

811
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,399
ask users to change their password on

812
00:27:36,399 --> 00:27:39,279
indication suspicion a compromise

813
00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:40,720
now these are the headlines right

814
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:42,399
there's a bunch of other stuff that they

815
00:27:42,399 --> 00:27:44,480
say we should also do which we couldn't

816
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:46,559
really do as well before

817
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:48,159
ubiquitous transport layer encryption

818
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:50,080
perfect example a user behavioral

819
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:52,000
analytics perfect example

820
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,520
bob normally goes into the office and he

821
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:54,960
logs on to the marketing department and

822
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:56,320
he gets in there at nine he leaves at

823
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:56,799
five

824
00:27:56,799 --> 00:27:58,480
one day bob logs in from beijing and

825
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:01,840
pulls down five terabytes of data

826
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:04,559
it's not bob that is much more

827
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:06,320
intelligent than telling bob he should

828
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:07,600
have an uppercase letter summary in his

829
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:10,158
password

830
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:12,640
now as we sort of delve into the other

831
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,000
problems with passwords and there are

832
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,399
more problems than what we have time for

833
00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:18,320
one of the problems is they keep popping

834
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:20,240
up all over the place

835
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:23,360
in locations such as this collection

836
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:25,919
number one now about two years ago

837
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:27,679
in fact i remember where it was it was

838
00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:30,559
january 2019

839
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:34,399
this collection of nearly 2.7 billion

840
00:28:34,399 --> 00:28:37,039
email address and password pairs popped

841
00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:39,600
up online

842
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:42,159
and if we have a look at what is in this

843
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:43,120
collection

844
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:45,919
it looks like this now imagine a set of

845
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:47,279
37 rows is just

846
00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:50,000
2.7 billion rows and this is a

847
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,200
credential stuffing

848
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:53,039
list sometimes referred to as a combo

849
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:54,399
list

850
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:56,480
email address password pairs doesn't

851
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:58,159
matter where they're from all that

852
00:28:58,159 --> 00:28:59,279
matters is that they

853
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:02,080
worked somewhere and by virtue of the

854
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:03,679
fact that people will reuse their

855
00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:05,360
passwords many of these

856
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:09,919
combos here will work in other locations

857
00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:11,840
now this data was circulating quite

858
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:13,279
extensively and people would ask me

859
00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:14,480
they'd say

860
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:16,240
did you get it from the dark web it's

861
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:18,799
always scary was it from the dark web

862
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:20,320
and i'd say no no it's much worse than

863
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:21,919
that it's much much scarier than the

864
00:29:21,919 --> 00:29:23,520
dark web

865
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:26,720
it's twitter it's the clear win and the

866
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:29,520
reason i say it's much scarier

867
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:32,000
is that as easily accessible as tour

868
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
hidden services are

869
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,600
i'm much more worried about the fact

870
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:38,720
that data proliferates so extensively in

871
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:40,880
the clear because anyone could go and

872
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:42,480
download those files

873
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:45,600
and have billions of credential pairs

874
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,520
owned by innocent victims who then gone

875
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:50,720
and use them in other locations

876
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:53,279
part of the the challenge here is that

877
00:29:53,279 --> 00:29:54,799
we do have to educate the people we have

878
00:29:54,799 --> 00:29:56,640
to educate the people not to

879
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:59,120
reuse their password and initiatives

880
00:29:59,120 --> 00:29:59,840
such as

881
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:02,880
this and the ncscs will help us

882
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:05,039
move in a direction where we're not

883
00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:08,640
doing silly things with passwords but

884
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:11,679
the industry as a whole is also making

885
00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:13,840
it very difficult for people

886
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:16,080
to make good security decisions and i'm

887
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:18,720
going to give you an example of that

888
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:22,799
i got this email a little while ago

889
00:30:22,799 --> 00:30:26,000
now when i got this email

890
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:29,279
and i looked at it i went all right

891
00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:32,720
this is a bank and they are asking me to

892
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:35,520
download something and run it

893
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:38,000
this looks fishy so far just on what i

894
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,840
see here has all the hallmarks of a

895
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:42,000
fishy email

896
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,320
but i'm going to do something which is

897
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:45,760
very advanced

898
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,440
and this is going to give me a better

899
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:48,799
idea as to whether it's legitimate or

900
00:30:48,799 --> 00:30:49,279
not

901
00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:52,080
i'm going to tap and hold on that app

902
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:52,960
store button

903
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:56,240
on my iphone i'm not going to tap it too

904
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:57,360
quickly otherwise it will follow the

905
00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:00,080
link tap and hold and here's what i see

906
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:02,559
and if i expand this out this is what

907
00:31:02,559 --> 00:31:03,200
the link

908
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:06,640
looks like now

909
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:10,159
does this look like anz bank

910
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:14,720
no not really is it served over https

911
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:17,120
well first of all that alone is not

912
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:18,480
really an indicator that you can trust

913
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:19,840
the site it's just an indicator that

914
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:21,760
we're going to have a tls connection

915
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:24,559
but second of all no it's not and

916
00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:26,080
everything about this was looking super

917
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:27,760
fishy

918
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:30,320
but i'm a security guy and i'm curious

919
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:32,080
and i've done this a few times before

920
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:34,080
yolo let's just follow the link and it

921
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:36,799
goes here

922
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:41,279
c00.adobe.com it's like

923
00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:44,080
is this anz is this legitimate

924
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:45,760
everything about this reeks of

925
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:49,519
a fish so i got in touch some people at

926
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:50,799
anz and said hey look i'm getting

927
00:31:50,799 --> 00:31:51,440
fishing

928
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:53,120
attacks that uh that look like they're

929
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:55,120
trying to come from anz

930
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:57,279
no they're real like real phishing

931
00:31:57,279 --> 00:32:00,159
attacks no no like real emails this is

932
00:32:00,159 --> 00:32:01,840
legitimate communication

933
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:05,039
from anz to customers and i i happen to

934
00:32:05,039 --> 00:32:06,640
spend a bit of time with anz at a later

935
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:08,159
date and i i showed this in a

936
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:09,519
presentation and there's just all these

937
00:32:09,519 --> 00:32:11,760
security people at the front going oh

938
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:13,840
crap there's marketing again it's always

939
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:16,720
marketing it's always marketing's fault

940
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:19,440
but the problem is and i see this over

941
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:20,559
and over and over again had the same

942
00:32:20,559 --> 00:32:22,000
thing with the tax office only a few

943
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,679
weeks ago

944
00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:25,679
legitimate organizations sending

945
00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:27,519
legitimate communications

946
00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:29,200
are indistinguishable from phishing

947
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:30,960
attacks now of course phishing attacks

948
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:33,360
are designed to be indistinguishable

949
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:35,279
from legitimate communications they will

950
00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:38,240
emulate that but then we try and tell

951
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:40,399
people not to click on suspicious links

952
00:32:40,399 --> 00:32:41,679
you know don't be

953
00:32:41,679 --> 00:32:43,200
fished and socially engineered into

954
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:44,559
downloading and running things and then

955
00:32:44,559 --> 00:32:46,240
we do stuff like this

956
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:49,760
so we as an industry have to do

957
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:52,880
a lot better not to look

958
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:56,640
exactly like a phishing attack

959
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:59,679
the difficulty here is how can

960
00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:02,799
consumers individual normal everyday

961
00:33:02,799 --> 00:33:04,880
moms and dads and normal people

962
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:08,399
make decisions about security posture

963
00:33:08,399 --> 00:33:11,440
when we have things like this now

964
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:12,880
extending that logic particularly the

965
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:14,559
mums and dads logic

966
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:17,360
how do they make good security decisions

967
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:18,559
about products

968
00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:22,080
like this one is a kids tracking watch

969
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:23,360
now the value proposition of a kid's

970
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:24,960
tracking watch is it appeals to what's

971
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:27,440
referred to as a helicopter parent

972
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:29,679
and a helicopter parent is someone who

973
00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:31,919
hovers around the kids they want to know

974
00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:33,519
where are the kids so the kid's okay the

975
00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:34,799
kids in danger have the kids being

976
00:33:34,799 --> 00:33:37,200
kidnapped or not

977
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:39,760
so what you do is you get this watch and

978
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:41,120
you put this watch

979
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:44,240
on the kid's wrist and this watch has

980
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:47,360
a 3g sim card it's got a gps built into

981
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:48,399
it it's also got a speaker and a

982
00:33:48,399 --> 00:33:49,840
microphone we'll come back to that

983
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:52,399
and then you can track where the kid

984
00:33:52,399 --> 00:33:53,360
goes

985
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:55,120
and in fact i've still got this watch on

986
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:57,600
my desk

987
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:02,000
in my office right here and i keep it as

988
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,440
a little reminder

989
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:05,919
of just how messed up stuff gets but

990
00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:07,600
we'll get back to that in just a moment

991
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:08,320
so

992
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:11,440
here's the watch now this

993
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:14,079
watch is made by an australian company

994
00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:15,599
called tiktok track

995
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:17,599
and as you can see here it's the watch

996
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:18,719
that watches out

997
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:20,879
for them little uh little clever play on

998
00:34:20,879 --> 00:34:22,079
words there

999
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:24,639
now a mate of mine in the uk guy called

1000
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:26,800
ken munro he runs a penetration testing

1001
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,320
company called pentest partners

1002
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:30,480
and pen test partners had found lots of

1003
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:32,159
interesting vulnerabilities

1004
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:34,960
with kids tracking watches in the past

1005
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:36,639
and he saw this one pop up on the market

1006
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:37,918
and he got in touch with me and he said

1007
00:34:37,918 --> 00:34:39,760
hey look uh

1008
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:42,320
this is in australia you're in australia

1009
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:43,679
you should get one of these and we'll

1010
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:44,879
have a look at it and we'll see how it

1011
00:34:44,879 --> 00:34:46,159
goes

1012
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:47,520
so i thought this would be interesting

1013
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:50,480
i'll uh i went to the website

1014
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:52,239
the tick tock track website and i had a

1015
00:34:52,239 --> 00:34:53,760
read of it and

1016
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:55,359
and i saw the big padlock so i knew it

1017
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:57,680
would be okay

1018
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:59,760
this is basically like the hoodie of

1019
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:00,880
hackers like this

1020
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:02,560
this is just imagery which means

1021
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:04,800
absolutely nothing

1022
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:06,560
tiktok track software is custom built

1023
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:08,400
and securely hosted in brisbane

1024
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:09,920
queensland now this is only just up the

1025
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:11,520
road from it's about an hour drive away

1026
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:13,119
and i'm a very proud australian very

1027
00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:14,880
proud queenslander and we have many

1028
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:17,200
wonderful things here

1029
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:20,079
but when i think of queensland i'm not

1030
00:35:20,079 --> 00:35:21,599
thinking about a security like this is

1031
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:22,800
not the first thing that comes to mind

1032
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:23,520
it's like

1033
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:25,040
beaches and the great barrier reef like

1034
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:27,520
that's what comes to mind

1035
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:30,640
so why do we have this well again we

1036
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:32,079
sort of come back to this theme

1037
00:35:32,079 --> 00:35:35,359
of how is security

1038
00:35:35,359 --> 00:35:38,000
represented what's the image people are

1039
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,119
trying to create well they're trying to

1040
00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:40,160
say look this is

1041
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:42,160
hosted near us it's on aussie soil it'll

1042
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:45,920
be fine and then i saw the second line

1043
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:47,280
we take the security of your data

1044
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:50,079
seriously and the reason i laugh at that

1045
00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:50,480
is

1046
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:52,640
that is how pretty much every single

1047
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:54,960
bridge disclosure notice i've ever seen

1048
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:58,320
begins it's like hi troy just writing to

1049
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:00,240
let you know uh we take the security of

1050
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:02,079
your data seriously uh by the way we had

1051
00:36:02,079 --> 00:36:03,680
a data security incident where we didn't

1052
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:04,960
take it seriously enough and now your

1053
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:06,640
data is on the dark web

1054
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:09,680
or even worse on twitter so i

1055
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:13,359
just uh i lament that this term

1056
00:36:13,359 --> 00:36:16,240
was used here and as i'm reading this

1057
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:17,040
i'm going oh

1058
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:19,760
just just none of this looks good none

1059
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:20,560
of this looks good

1060
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:22,960
you would have to be crazy to get one of

1061
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:26,160
these watches and put it on your kid so

1062
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:27,440
anyway i got one of these watches and i

1063
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:28,880
put on my kid

1064
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:32,240
this is research this is elle

1065
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:34,480
and she was six years old at the time so

1066
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:36,720
this was about two years ago now

1067
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:38,880
and that watch is this exact watch i

1068
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:41,119
have in my hand now

1069
00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:42,800
now as you can see on the screen grab

1070
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,560
here the watch actually says gator

1071
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:47,520
it doesn't say tick-tock track and the

1072
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:48,240
reason why

1073
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:50,480
is that this is made by a chinese

1074
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:52,800
company running out of shenzhen

1075
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:54,000
and there is certainly nothing wrong

1076
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,520
with the chinese made watch i have one

1077
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:56,720
on my wrist here it just

1078
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:59,359
has an apple logo instead of a gator

1079
00:36:59,359 --> 00:37:01,359
logo

1080
00:37:01,359 --> 00:37:03,520
but i raise it because it's interesting

1081
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:04,640
that the watch is made by another

1082
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:05,920
company and then you get tick tock track

1083
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:07,200
and they get the watch and then they

1084
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:08,079
build

1085
00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:09,680
all the ecosystem around it they build

1086
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:11,440
the apis and they build

1087
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:13,280
the front end to it the mobile app which

1088
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:15,839
you'll see in just a moment

1089
00:37:15,839 --> 00:37:18,640
so we get this watch and we start taking

1090
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:19,760
a look at it

1091
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:22,800
and it's very easy to identify the apis

1092
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:24,320
that sit behind the watch and also

1093
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:25,599
behind the companion app

1094
00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:28,960
that runs on your phone so ken starts

1095
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:31,280
poking away and he finds an api like

1096
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:32,160
this

1097
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:36,480
it's an api to get yourself a family

1098
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:38,640
and what it does is it calls a path

1099
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:40,079
which passes a parameter

1100
00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:42,480
family identifier equals and then it

1101
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:45,440
passes this number

1102
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:47,680
now because ken's a smart guy and he can

1103
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:50,880
count he can hack

1104
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:53,119
so he literally just changed the number

1105
00:37:53,119 --> 00:37:54,400
he changed

1106
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:58,320
this number 3497 to another number

1107
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:01,280
and he got another family that's it was

1108
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:04,480
that simple

1109
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:06,560
this is alarming in many ways uh one of

1110
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:08,079
the ways actually it was alarming is

1111
00:38:08,079 --> 00:38:09,200
it's not like there was no

1112
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:11,119
authentication whatsoever you did have

1113
00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:12,960
to be authenticated there was a token

1114
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:15,200
passed on a request header

1115
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:17,200
but the authentication went like this

1116
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:19,200
are you logged in yep cool get whatever

1117
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:20,000
family you want

1118
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,320
so there was never an access control on

1119
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:25,200
the family itself

1120
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:26,560
another interesting thing that happened

1121
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:27,839
is a little bit tangential to the

1122
00:38:27,839 --> 00:38:30,000
security issue itself but

1123
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,920
after all of this happened and they they

1124
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:33,359
took it all offline and then it went

1125
00:38:33,359 --> 00:38:34,240
into the press

1126
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:36,400
uh that the ceo was questioned by

1127
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:37,440
journalists and

1128
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:40,240
um a journalist said to the ceo

1129
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:41,920
journalists always ask us they're like

1130
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:43,200
how many aussie families have been

1131
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:45,599
impacted by this and she said look

1132
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:46,560
that's uh you know

1133
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:48,160
the sales volumes are commercial and

1134
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:49,440
confidence that's not something we want

1135
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:49,920
to share

1136
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:51,440
and i'm looking at the api again i

1137
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:52,880
reckon i know how many aussie families

1138
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:54,160
have been impacted by this

1139
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:56,560
is it roughly three and a half thousand

1140
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:58,560
so yeah don't put commercial secrets in

1141
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:00,880
your api calls either

1142
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,560
now this of course is just an odata

1143
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:05,839
query and this is a filter

1144
00:39:05,839 --> 00:39:08,000
many months later in fact at the

1145
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,839
beginning of 2020

1146
00:39:09,839 --> 00:39:12,640
someone found a regression bug after

1147
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:14,640
they had fixed this

1148
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:16,320
and they found that if you remove the

1149
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:18,800
filter it does exactly what

1150
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:20,960
you think removing your filter does it

1151
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:22,320
actually returned all the data in fact

1152
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:23,119
he

1153
00:39:23,119 --> 00:39:25,520
he returned all the data he took a a

1154
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:26,640
backup

1155
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:29,839
and sent it to me so unfortunately this

1156
00:39:29,839 --> 00:39:31,760
is uh this is one of those ones that did

1157
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:32,960
come back to bite them again

1158
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:35,280
but let's delve down further into this

1159
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:37,040
api

1160
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:39,760
when you called that api you got a

1161
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:40,480
family

1162
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:44,480
a json response with my personal data

1163
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:47,359
and of course if you minus one in this

1164
00:39:47,359 --> 00:39:49,280
case because i registered quite

1165
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:50,880
close to the point at which they took

1166
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:52,240
the service down and you counted

1167
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:53,520
backwards by let's say three and a half

1168
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:55,040
thousand you would get another family

1169
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:56,000
and you get all this personal

1170
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:59,680
data there are also apis to do things

1171
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:00,079
like

1172
00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:05,280
getting a child with a post request

1173
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:06,880
now for the technical people out there

1174
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:08,560
and for those who are more of the

1175
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:10,960
rastafarian kind of mindset about what

1176
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:12,880
verbs are restful or not or what is a

1177
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:15,280
proper restful implementation of a verb

1178
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:18,319
why we are getting something with a post

1179
00:40:18,319 --> 00:40:19,920
which is meant to change state is a bit

1180
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:21,440
beyond me and it's kind of tangential to

1181
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:22,720
the security issue but it just

1182
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:26,560
bugs me every time i see it so anyway

1183
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:29,040
you get a child with a post you pass a

1184
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:29,920
family id

1185
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:33,359
same problem relocate a child

1186
00:40:33,359 --> 00:40:36,480
same problem every one of the apis had

1187
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:38,240
the same problem

1188
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:39,599
post is probably a bit more appropriate

1189
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:41,119
here than it get maybe it should be put

1190
00:40:41,119 --> 00:40:41,760
i don't know

1191
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:44,960
rest people let me know regardless same

1192
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:46,160
issue here

1193
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:48,720
no matter what verb was used we could

1194
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:49,280
still

1195
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:51,760
relocate a child or get a child's

1196
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:52,800
location

1197
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:56,800
just by passing an innumerable number

1198
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:59,839
so we wanted to demonstrate this problem

1199
00:40:59,839 --> 00:41:02,400
we put the watch on l sent her to tennis

1200
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:03,839
camp it was the holidays when we did

1201
00:41:03,839 --> 00:41:05,200
this

1202
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:07,280
so sandel off to tennis camp i open up

1203
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:08,960
the app and i can see

1204
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:11,680
that she's at the tennis club and i as a

1205
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:13,119
helicopter parent know that she has not

1206
00:41:13,119 --> 00:41:15,040
been kidnapped

1207
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:17,599
and then ken because he has access to

1208
00:41:17,599 --> 00:41:20,079
the api because he can count dumps

1209
00:41:20,079 --> 00:41:21,280
around the ocean

1210
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:23,119
so now it's like i'm looking at my app

1211
00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:25,040
and going all right so my daughter's

1212
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:27,040
out there off wave break island far

1213
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:28,560
enough like she can swim a little bit

1214
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:30,079
but can't you get to the island i don't

1215
00:41:30,079 --> 00:41:31,760
know

1216
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:33,599
and all of this was because of an

1217
00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:35,119
insecure direct object reference

1218
00:41:35,119 --> 00:41:37,119
vulnerability in the api an idol it's

1219
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:37,920
like the

1220
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:41,359
oldest trick in the book

1221
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:44,480
but it was worse than that

1222
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:48,000
this watch also works as a phone this is

1223
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,760
why it has a speaker and a microphone in

1224
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:51,119
it

1225
00:41:51,119 --> 00:41:53,280
but it would be weird if just any old

1226
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:55,040
person could call your child and start

1227
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:56,240
having conversation

1228
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:59,599
with them so you have to specify what is

1229
00:41:59,599 --> 00:42:01,359
the phone number of a parent now there's

1230
00:42:01,359 --> 00:42:03,280
a handy api

1231
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:05,440
that you can do this with and by about

1232
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:06,720
now you can think you can see where this

1233
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:08,960
discussion is going

1234
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:12,000
so we wanted to demonstrate it we set

1235
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,599
all up in bed

1236
00:42:13,599 --> 00:42:16,000
and ken got one of his colleagues a guy

1237
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,440
called vangelis

1238
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:20,640
to set himself as the parent

1239
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:22,720
and then vangelis calls out now watch

1240
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:24,319
what happens in this video and

1241
00:42:24,319 --> 00:42:25,920
particularly watch what l

1242
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:31,839
has to do in order to take the call

1243
00:42:33,380 --> 00:42:44,260
[Music]

1244
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:52,000
hi who are you

1245
00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:58,240
i am

1246
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:00,480
and like two years on watching that it

1247
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:02,880
still feels freaky

1248
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:05,920
it's super freaky now did you notice

1249
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:07,040
what she did

1250
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:11,200
to answer the call nothing

1251
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:13,119
zero interaction it's one of the reasons

1252
00:43:13,119 --> 00:43:14,560
these got banned in germany because they

1253
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:15,920
said look it's just a surreptitious

1254
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:17,040
listening device

1255
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:19,599
you can have that device somewhere

1256
00:43:19,599 --> 00:43:20,480
anywhere

1257
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:22,319
and remotely trigger it to start

1258
00:43:22,319 --> 00:43:23,920
listening

1259
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:26,720
which is super super super concerning

1260
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:27,280
and again

1261
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:30,560
idol oldest trick in the book now we

1262
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:32,400
disclosed this responsibly

1263
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:35,040
and it wasn't the worst disclosure i've

1264
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:36,400
been involved in but it was a long way

1265
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:38,240
from the best as well and it took quite

1266
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:38,720
a bit of

1267
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:42,240
effort to try and explain that ken and i

1268
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:44,319
were good guys we weren't out there to

1269
00:43:44,319 --> 00:43:45,920
screw the company over or anything like

1270
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:46,720
that and

1271
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:48,640
we made sure that disclosure happened

1272
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:49,760
and the

1273
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:51,440
the service was offline before anything

1274
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:53,119
went past like we did all the normal

1275
00:43:53,119 --> 00:43:54,000
good stuff that you

1276
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:57,359
do but disclosure remains a really

1277
00:43:57,359 --> 00:43:58,000
challenging

1278
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
issue in this industry doing it in a

1279
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,640
responsible fashion

1280
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:05,040
which drives us towards a better

1281
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:06,800
security posture this is the problem

1282
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:08,240
that we keep having

1283
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:10,319
and i want to leave you with a just an

1284
00:44:10,319 --> 00:44:11,680
absolutely

1285
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:14,640
beautiful example of this and it relates

1286
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:16,400
to this padlock

1287
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:18,640
now this is a biometric padlock and

1288
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:19,920
there's a guy with a youtube channel

1289
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:21,760
called the lock picking

1290
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:23,760
massively popular channel he goes and

1291
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:25,440
physically penetration tests all of

1292
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:27,040
these different padlocks

1293
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:29,040
extremely entertaining usually takes him

1294
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:30,560
about 30 seconds to get through just

1295
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:32,240
about any lock

1296
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:35,280
so anyway he's he's looking at this lock

1297
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:37,920
and he finds as a screw on the side of

1298
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:39,280
the lock

1299
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:41,200
and the screw does exactly what you're

1300
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:42,560
thinking the screw does like he takes

1301
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:44,560
any screwdriver he undoes the screw lock

1302
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:46,160
comes apart that's not the good bit

1303
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:49,200
it's a good bit but here's the kicker

1304
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:51,680
because he's a responsible guy he sends

1305
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:53,040
a message to the company and he says

1306
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:53,599
look

1307
00:44:53,599 --> 00:44:55,680
i got your lock i undid the screw with

1308
00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:56,880
my screwdriver

1309
00:44:56,880 --> 00:44:58,640
and the thing came apart i really think

1310
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:00,079
you got a problem

1311
00:45:00,079 --> 00:45:01,760
and the company responded in a way which

1312
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:03,920
just perfectly illustrates the problem

1313
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:04,640
that

1314
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:06,720
i and many others have day in and day

1315
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:08,960
out in the infosec industry

1316
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:12,000
and they said the lock is invincible to

1317
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,319
people who do not have a screwdriver

1318
00:45:14,319 --> 00:45:16,880
and this again just perfectly

1319
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:18,000
illustrates the

1320
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,400
lack of understanding and responsible

1321
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:21,440
action

1322
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:23,760
taken by organizations building

1323
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:26,160
vulnerable things

1324
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:29,040
so with that that is the end of my talk

1325
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:29,920
thank you

1326
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:32,079
very much for joining in and i believe

1327
00:45:32,079 --> 00:45:32,960
that we are

1328
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:43,839
now going to go to some q a
