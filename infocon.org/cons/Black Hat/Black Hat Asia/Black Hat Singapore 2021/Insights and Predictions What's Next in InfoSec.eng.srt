1
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:05,200
hey thanks uh welcome everybody to

2
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:07,680
the opening day session for day two of

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:10,320
black hat asia my name is jeff wilson

4
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:11,840
and i am the chief analyst for cyber

5
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:14,160
security technology at amdia

6
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:16,640
uh and we have a really great panel here

7
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:19,119
uh to have a a discussion about uh

8
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:19,920
what's

9
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:22,560
what's coming next 2020 was a year like

10
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:25,199
um never before well i don't know not in

11
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:28,000
my time um normal life across the world

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,880
was upended due to a pandemic

13
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:33,200
including how we work how we live

14
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,640
the pandemic and the lockdowns and

15
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:36,079
shelter and place orders that followed

16
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:38,239
had a tremendous impact on the cyber

17
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:40,399
security ecosystem as well

18
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:42,079
although everyone adapted quickly to the

19
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:44,719
new world embrace the new new uses of

20
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:47,280
technology to work from home there

21
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,200
are many new threats and vulnerabilities

22
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,840
to deal with as a result

23
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,559
so far 2021 brings a vaccine

24
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:56,879
in some cases a return to semi-normal or

25
00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:59,440
normal in some parts of the word world

26
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:00,960
and some well-deserved hope and

27
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,039
opportunity for organizations to maybe

28
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:05,040
re-look at how

29
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,200
they they think about cyber security

30
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,600
infosec and secure connectivity in the

31
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,200
in the face of these massive changes

32
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,960
that we've gone through

33
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,759
unfortunately uh all of these changes

34
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:18,240
make infosec's job a lot harder

35
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:20,000
so what are those changes and how can

36
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,920
organizations deal with them that's what

37
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,240
we really want to discuss today

38
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:26,479
the the panel has already uh been

39
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:28,159
introduced but i'd like to just go ahead

40
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:30,400
and thank neil lydia vandana and vitali

41
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,079
for being here today

42
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:34,880
uh and um we all we are taking questions

43
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:37,040
uh from the audience we'll probably take

44
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:39,439
most of them at the end but if i see

45
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:41,119
something interesting along the way i am

46
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:42,960
monitoring so maybe we'll sneak one in

47
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,399
so make sure if you do have questions

48
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:45,680
for us or things you want to make sure

49
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,840
we cover um that you go ahead and let us

50
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:48,880
know

51
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:50,399
all right so the first question i want

52
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:51,360
to ask

53
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,799
i want to give everybody an opportunity

54
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:56,479
to sort of give their position on

55
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:59,680
what you think are the key forces

56
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,920
in your view that are shaping the future

57
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,000
of cyber security so when you're

58
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,840
trying to create a picture for someone

59
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:08,479
of what's coming or what's next what are

60
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:10,800
the things that you really um consider

61
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,400
as as the key drivers and i'll start

62
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,319
with lydia

63
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:16,720
thanks jeff um

64
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:19,120
i think i think i think the nail on the

65
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:21,280
head when you sort of mention

66
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,959
the year that was really the pandemic

67
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:26,080
and i know i guess in my line of work um

68
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,760
a big discussion that we had yesterday

69
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:30,000
in our meet up is just the push to

70
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,840
digital transformation

71
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:34,400
um with people being encouraged to stay

72
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,280
home

73
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,080
stay safe protect loved ones

74
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,519
people still need to shop they still

75
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:41,280
need to see their doctor they still need

76
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,200
to rent they still need to attend

77
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,959
appointments for their kids so we're

78
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:47,280
seeing a lot of those face-to-face

79
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,959
previous

80
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:50,959
interactions move

81
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:53,840
to more of a digital experience and i

82
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,000
know i'm i'm seeing that aggressively

83
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,319
push um in you know many of the

84
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:00,000
organizations that i'm working for as

85
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,120
well

86
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,040
and i guess i guess the flow and effect

87
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,519
that i see is a massive impact is the

88
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:07,440
ability then to assess

89
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,599
those companies so i think previously we

90
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:12,000
would do some sort of due diligence or

91
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,400
third party assessment but i think

92
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,720
there's a much bigger focus on that you

93
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,720
know we need to say we need to have a

94
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:21,120
look at that where i think before it was

95
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,280
we're doing it but i think now we need

96
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,680
to put more of a focus on it you know i

97
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:29,200
can see some we we need x thing

98
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:32,000
let's teammates purchase of x thing and

99
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
then they come up to security and go oh

100
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,319
hey we need to do the due diligence and

101
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:37,200
it's

102
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,120
seeing that maybe things aren't up to

103
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,640
scratch or perhaps we didn't look all

104
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,400
the requirements and you know we just

105
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,480
kind of kept accepting risk after risk

106
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:47,360
after risk so i guess for me still a

107
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:50,000
massive focus on digital transformation

108
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,440
and just ensuring

109
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:54,239
um whoever we're outsourcing our data to

110
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:55,120
is

111
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:58,239
is safe and secure

112
00:03:58,239 --> 00:03:59,920
excellent um i'm just going to go in the

113
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,680
order of my zoom screen because that's

114
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:05,040
the easiest so grifter you're next sure

115
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,840
um so yeah i think um you know i think

116
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,439
lydia hit the nail on the head digital

117
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:11,519
transformation is huge i think when it

118
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:14,560
comes to information security we have

119
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,798
always been expected to be agile right

120
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:19,358
and respond to

121
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:22,000
who knows what the next day right um one

122
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,919
day everything seems fine you're like

123
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:25,759
yeah we're great everything's secure

124
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:28,960
we're good and then somebody discovers

125
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,720
that there's a vulnerability out there

126
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,720
and some product that you're using in

127
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:35,199
your environment or exploit code is

128
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:37,680
found on a site somewhere that that

129
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,040
tells you that it's been out there for a

130
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,759
little while and our whole world changes

131
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:44,320
um the next morning and and for me

132
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,479
that's part of the joy of information

133
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:48,160
security is you just never know what's

134
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,120
coming

135
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:52,800
but but the last you know 18 months

136
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,040
uh have put us in a whole different

137
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,280
place when it comes to to being agile

138
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:00,240
right we we are used to responding to

139
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,759
things like oh there's a new

140
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:03,199
vulnerability or there's a new exploit

141
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:05,600
we're not used to responding to hey your

142
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,840
entire workforce just went home

143
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:08,880
um

144
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:11,759
now defend against that and so so that's

145
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:13,600
been a really interesting uh you know

146
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,720
challenge for for all of us um one

147
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,960
defending uh a network that now just

148
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,199
expanded out into the living rooms and

149
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:24,160
uh and corners of of kitchens all around

150
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:26,320
the world but um

151
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:27,520
but also

152
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,199
the um

153
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:31,280
the way that our employees were working

154
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,280
and the way that the individuals were

155
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:34,639
defending were working the way that

156
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:38,240
information has been shared has been um

157
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:41,520
has been incredibly challenging and

158
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:42,880
sometimes fun

159
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:43,680
uh

160
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,520
a lot of times frustrating

161
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,520
but um like i said i think i think we

162
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,759
were well positioned for that kind of

163
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:53,039
challenge just based on the fact that um

164
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:54,639
our industry pulls us in a lot of

165
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:56,960
different directions every day and and

166
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,080
having to

167
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,880
respond to that um i think we we had a

168
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:03,039
we have a pretty good crew

169
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:05,280
out there in our industry who i think in

170
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,600
in a lot of cases pulled it off yeah we

171
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,360
will we will talk about that crew a

172
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,639
little bit later

173
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:12,319
and i will say you know for context

174
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:14,240
everyone had their own experience

175
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,800
um but i mean i had vendors in the

176
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,960
security space particularly in kind of

177
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:21,600
the vpn secure connectivity space say

178
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,520
they had customers call them a big

179
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:26,240
customer they had 50 000 concurrent vpn

180
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,840
sessions call them and say hey in the

181
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,840
next two weeks we need to we need to

182
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:32,560
scale that up to 250 000.

183
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,199
this is like we knew the perimeter was

184
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:37,280
going away and it has like gradually

185
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,639
gone away but it's never done that

186
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:40,000
before so that was

187
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,919
and you know everyone's probably got a

188
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:43,199
good story like that that they could

189
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:45,280
tell how about you vitaly

190
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,560
you know

191
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,319
what are your thoughts on the pandemic

192
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:50,000
and you know maybe some of the lasting

193
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,479
effects uh in changes in infosec

194
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:57,520
uh well i i have to start from i was

195
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:00,000
saying good day everyone and i'm totally

196
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,160
um aligned with what christopher said

197
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,280
that the

198
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,880
pandemic definitely changed the

199
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:07,520
environment and the way we work but uh

200
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,440
being part of the anti-malware industry

201
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,199
we also observed that it changed not

202
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:13,440
only you know the defender's side work

203
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:16,560
but also the malware created some other

204
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:19,120
operators too uh we've seen them uh

205
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:22,080
following the trend of uh of these waves

206
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,400
basically where waves would

207
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,960
completely uh you know shut down their

208
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,560
activities sometimes down to the very

209
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:31,199
very low level and then when uh there

210
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:33,280
was some you know easiness and moving

211
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,520
around and maybe people got used to

212
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,360
working from home they restarted some of

213
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,960
their operations and

214
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:41,039
this has reflected on the number of uh

215
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:42,720
malware samples we detected on the

216
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,319
customer's machines which was quite

217
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:46,080
interesting to follow

218
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,879
and we also have seen them abusing these

219
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:51,759
a lot and this is something that i

220
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:54,240
wouldn't expect i'm an ethical device

221
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,759
from the

222
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:57,599
attackers from from the malvern writers

223
00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:00,720
from our operators uh to be very

224
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,720
to have very high uh ethical standards

225
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,720
but they they definitely abused such a

226
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,879
topic that shouldn't be touched at all

227
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:09,919
uh by you know masquerading masquerading

228
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:12,639
their attack campaigns behind let's say

229
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:15,120
a vaccine availability or some payout

230
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,120
for people in need or government

231
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,360
regulations updates and things like this

232
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,759
they use up for social engineering to

233
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:23,599
trick the users you know to follow that

234
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:25,759
link or open the attachment and and

235
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:27,280
affect their machines

236
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,680
and i think this is really really bad

237
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:32,640
that's going on um but otherwise i i do

238
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,559
believe i'm i'm an optimist and i

239
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:36,719
believe that the pandemic will pass and

240
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:39,120
we'll get back to the uh normal world

241
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,200
and i think that um the question you

242
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,120
started you you rise in the beginning

243
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,839
like what drives uh infosec um i think

244
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:48,720
uh we have more and more role of infosec

245
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,959
now in terms of the international you

246
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:54,000
know politics it's used as a tool now

247
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,440
and uh this is going just uh only to to

248
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:00,080
increase uh we see all these uh

249
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:03,120
indictments uh for apt attackers that i

250
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,519
believe to be nation state supported uh

251
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:07,440
seventh-day country and this is going to

252
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,839
escalate even further in my opinion and

253
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:12,080
infosect can become really

254
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:16,160
very politicized uh area uh and we

255
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:18,080
definitely have to be prepared for that

256
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,000
somehow

257
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,399
yeah excellent and then of course last

258
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:26,480
but not least uh we have vendana

259
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:27,839
so if you

260
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:30,959
overall thoughts hey how's it going yeah

261
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:32,720
good how about you

262
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:36,560
oh you're doing this

263
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,160
so i'll start off with saying hi

264
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:41,279
everyone um so i'll add on to what my

265
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:43,200
speakers said uh we all know that year

266
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,600
and a half was very different than we

267
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,600
anticipated which led to the whole

268
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:50,080
paradigm shift where cloud migration and

269
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:53,360
computing took the top priority and as

270
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,959
you mentioned that the boundaries don't

271
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:57,279
exist anymore so focus of all the

272
00:09:57,279 --> 00:09:59,519
organizations started shifting to uh

273
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:01,279
something called zero trust networks

274
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:03,279
like everybody started talking about in

275
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:05,120
the past year that we need to attain

276
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,640
zero trust

277
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:09,040
working with multiple technologies to

278
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:12,079
build the whole uh entire ecosystem

279
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:15,600
that's there but how about uh security

280
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,920
of third party software and dependencies

281
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,519
and you'll see me talking about that a

282
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:22,640
lot but i believe this is one area which

283
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:25,200
needs a lot more attention which was

284
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,600
there but it needs more attention

285
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,760
because it has creeped up on its own

286
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:32,320
form like in a different form with a

287
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,880
larger security ecosystem issues we saw

288
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,959
in the last year that we had some major

289
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:40,320
issues uh by the end of the year and um

290
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:43,440
apart from that insider threats

291
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,680
earlier what used to happen uh we had

292
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:47,519
routers firewalls everything which was

293
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:49,600
monitored inside the building we were

294
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,600
all going to office monitoring was

295
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,279
happening

296
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:55,600
i think but now we are all home we are

297
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,200
accessing our corporate network using

298
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,279
our home routers personal devices so

299
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:01,519
that again poses a big risk and which in

300
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:03,120
turn brings us to a point wherein we

301
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,360
need to have a holistic picture of

302
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,760
everything uh wherein we are allowing

303
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,839
our employees everyone to work from home

304
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:10,959
but then

305
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:13,200
we are giving them the less of less of

306
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:17,040
rights so it becomes important to have a

307
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:19,040
cloud ready approach we need to have

308
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:21,760
zero trust networks wherein we are

309
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,200
monitoring it

310
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,800
to the max

311
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,399
and ultimately

312
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:28,000
when it comes down to humans human are

313
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,560
human uh we cannot train them to a point

314
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,640
wherein they don't mistakes

315
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,720
so they don't make mistakes like we do

316
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,720
make mistakes then comes

317
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:39,839
ml into the picture wherein uh we are

318
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:42,480
trying to uh get as much as information

319
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,079
trying to correlate

320
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:46,480
and uh yesterday also we saw the keynote

321
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:47,519
around

322
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:49,920
lessons from 11 billion reached records

323
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:52,880
which are on around reaches and the dump

324
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:55,040
now to try to try and avoid that we need

325
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,560
to have uh

326
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,720
better technologies and i wouldn't say

327
00:11:58,720 --> 00:11:59,440
that

328
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,680
the organizations don't have it it says

329
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:04,480
that sometimes it's not used to its

330
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,920
fullest

331
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:08,639
so that that's my two cents on it

332
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:10,079
all right and actually kind of

333
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:11,519
dovetailing with that we have a couple

334
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:13,040
of questions in from the audience the

335
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:16,560
first one is it's not just byod the

336
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:19,440
employee's entire house is part of your

337
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:22,320
threat model now um they specifically

338
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,880
directed the question at neil but anyone

339
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:26,560
wants to take how do you deal with the

340
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:28,800
fact that it's not just their device

341
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:29,839
it's their

342
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:32,079
smart tv i mean i don't know if anyone's

343
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:34,079
done a count on connected devices in

344
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:35,680
your house

345
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:38,560
but in my house it's like over 40.

346
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:41,120
so and and i and i think that that's you

347
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:43,279
know not uncommon so what would you

348
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:45,600
suggest for dealing with that so i think

349
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:48,720
i think um you know vanda said it uh

350
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,240
perfectly like

351
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:52,639
zero trust has been a buzzword for you

352
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:54,480
know a few years everybody with zero

353
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:57,120
trust zero trust zero trust um but now

354
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:59,839
it's a necessity right it's not um it's

355
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:01,760
no longer just a buzzwordy thing and you

356
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,360
hear a lot of people talking about it a

357
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:06,399
lot more um because that's that's kind

358
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:07,600
of the solution when it comes from a

359
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:10,000
network standpoint as far as like

360
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,639
now i've got this laptop in my house and

361
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:14,560
i leave my doors unlocked because i live

362
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,320
in the midwestern united states and i

363
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:19,120
think that everything's fine um

364
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:21,040
you know that that i don't know i could

365
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,959
individually stop by people's houses and

366
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:24,320
sleep on their couch for a couple of

367
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:26,320
days and try to like secure things up

368
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,959
but um you know i'll throw that out

369
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:30,560
there to the audience i'll come sleep on

370
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,240
your couch and help you try to secure

371
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,880
your laptop

372
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:37,600
but there it is

373
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:40,480
but uh but yeah i think um

374
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,079
i mean that that's the new challenge

375
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:43,920
right and i think zero trust answers

376
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,680
some of that um but it doesn't answer

377
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:47,360
all of it and we're gonna be trying to

378
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,440
figure it out for a while because the

379
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,760
thing that um i don't think any of us

380
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,120
are surprised by is that now that

381
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:55,279
everybody has gone home to work and we

382
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:57,360
can see that people are productive from

383
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,320
home

384
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,519
guess what

385
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:01,440
they don't want to go back to the office

386
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:04,639
so this is here to stay

387
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:06,240
yeah it is fascinating to drive around

388
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,760
anywhere and look at all the commercial

389
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,680
real estate in progress buildings still

390
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:12,320
being built and just wondering

391
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,320
what happens anyone else have thoughts

392
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,320
on securing your home or i think we can

393
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,240
probably move on to the next

394
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:20,480
the next topic on the list here

395
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:21,440
um

396
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,959
so i wanted to talk obviously the

397
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:24,800
pandemic was you know kind of the

398
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,880
overwhelmingly discussed issue of the

399
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,079
last year

400
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:29,920
um but you know things actually did

401
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:32,160
happen noteworthy events happened and in

402
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:35,279
particular the solarwinds attack which

403
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:38,720
um you know very starkly demonstrated

404
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:41,519
the vulnerability of the supply chain

405
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:43,120
not something that hasn't been discussed

406
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:45,120
in the past but this was such a massive

407
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,839
and uh wide event that it's like hard to

408
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:49,279
sweep it under the rug even in the

409
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:51,760
middle of a pandemic and a crazy

410
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,120
election in the united states and

411
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:55,360
everything else that was going on so

412
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:59,519
it was a fairly significant event um

413
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:01,279
are we going to see a lot of new vendors

414
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:03,600
pop up as a result a lot of new silver

415
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,360
bullet type

416
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,600
solutions to protect against these types

417
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,600
of attacks or what do you think the

418
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,600
cohesive strategy moving forward is for

419
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:14,639
dealing with these supply chain attacks

420
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:18,480
uh vitaly you want to go first maybe

421
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,959
definitely the topic i would love to

422
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:23,040
explore more and we've been warning

423
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:25,839
about the supply chain attacks for

424
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:28,560
several years now since it all started i

425
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:29,839
think um

426
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:32,839
one one big uh was i think

427
00:15:32,839 --> 00:15:36,320
2017 2016 shadow pad attack on a

428
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:39,199
manufacturer of the ssh software for

429
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:41,920
enterprises software for basically

430
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:42,880
service

431
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,560
and clients

432
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:47,519
and um it was discovered just randomly

433
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:50,800
and one of in one big corporation um

434
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,399
just because of some suspicious traffic

435
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:54,880
but it was a kind of the big big page

436
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:58,079
that was opened uh in terms of uh

437
00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:00,880
supply chain attacks uh and we've seen

438
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:02,560
digital design software being

439
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:04,560
distributed in in tens of thousands of

440
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,560
copies to a number of companies

441
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:10,320
worldwide and bridged uh through it uh

442
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,120
and

443
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:13,120
i i think this is not going to stop any

444
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:15,120
time soon it is so efficient because it

445
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,639
just goes

446
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:18,639
below the radar of all security

447
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:21,040
solutions uh usually such software has

448
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:23,519
first uh the reputation of the vendor

449
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:26,560
that created it uh second is a digital

450
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,800
signature just sealing this trust that

451
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,959
is put by people you know over the years

452
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:32,240
to the vendor

453
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:35,199
and and then after all you are willingly

454
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:37,199
going and downloading or purchasing that

455
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:38,880
software so it's not just a random thing

456
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:41,040
that popped up in your mailbox so you

457
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:43,040
kind of tend to trust it since the

458
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:45,759
beginning and this is where uh something

459
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:48,560
that uh you guys brought up already the

460
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:50,639
zero trust model is really applicable i

461
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:52,000
think it's the most efficient you

462
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,839
shouldn't trust the trusted software

463
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:55,759
that's the thing you shouldn't trust the

464
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:57,920
trusted hardware as well so that's the

465
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:59,839
zero trust approach you should apply on

466
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:01,920
the enterprise level on your individual

467
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:05,280
um you know property level uh and just

468
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,520
you know uh there is this old saying

469
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:09,599
trust but verify right so whenever you

470
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:12,079
purchase something uh some supply chain

471
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:13,599
software just do some basic

472
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:15,520
verifications at least and i have to say

473
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:17,679
from experience with fast attacks they

474
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:20,240
could have been discovered if they were

475
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:22,160
if they were checked in the sandbox for

476
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:24,319
example for any suspicious traffic going

477
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:27,039
out of them or any potential you know

478
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:30,240
hijacking the you know legitimate dll

479
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:32,000
code in the binary so there are

480
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,080
solutions that can offer this i don't

481
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:36,080
think there is a silver bullet to make

482
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:38,640
it short but uh i think that applying

483
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,320
zero trust model and following the

484
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:43,600
principles should lead us the right way

485
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,520
the interesting point that zero trust is

486
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:47,200
more than just the people and end

487
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,360
systems but it's also uh should be

488
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,840
applied to this uh supply chain vandana

489
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:52,799
is there anything you want to add to

490
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:54,640
that

491
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:57,440
yeah absolutely um so when we talk about

492
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:59,280
supply chains as i mentioned that they

493
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:01,200
have been there and

494
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,360
the most or i would say the renewed

495
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:06,080
focus comes from the seriousness of the

496
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:08,720
impact that solarwinds attack had last

497
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:11,200
year and which was considered some of

498
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,440
the most uh and especially on the some

499
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:16,080
of the most secure organizations

500
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:18,559
uh there is a different spectrum to it

501
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:20,640
like how exactly it's coming up

502
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:23,440
uh if the compliance like gdpr ccpa and

503
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,440
all of these are not there companies or

504
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:28,320
organizations might uh not be able to

505
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:30,799
share that there is a breach that exists

506
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:34,000
so it's a congenital uh benefit that

507
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,760
they have they have been reached and

508
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:37,679
they have to notify it

509
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:40,000
and if i talk about especially the one

510
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,760
that happened last year which was

511
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,600
detected because uh we have more

512
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,679
observability and we have more

513
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:48,160
visibility into the network and that's

514
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,080
when some of the vendors who are more

515
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:52,640
into the figuring out things and finding

516
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,320
out that what are the threats that exist

517
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:56,559
in the network and how exactly we can uh

518
00:18:56,559 --> 00:18:58,480
find them and that's when they came up

519
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:00,160
with this that okay there is something

520
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:02,320
that exists in this network so attacks

521
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:04,880
are happening but only a few who are

522
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,559
actually able to find it

523
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:08,640
and uh there's another important aspect

524
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:10,799
is that there is a huge huge trust

525
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:14,000
between which is uh assumed i would say

526
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,320
uh assumed between different entities in

527
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:18,880
the software building process these days

528
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:21,200
every software project which takes its

529
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:23,200
uh security seriously is trying to

530
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,720
develop secure applications from the

531
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:27,679
get-go and trying to put out a secure by

532
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:30,240
design product out there however

533
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,760
they still have to trust a lot of

534
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:34,880
external dependencies be it primary uh

535
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:37,760
or proprietary code uh third-party apis

536
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:40,400
open source code for their softwares and

537
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,640
this is where all the attacks come from

538
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,240
and that's when we need to talk more

539
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:46,559
about observability we need to talk more

540
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:48,480
about uh

541
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,880
visibility into the network and hence

542
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:52,799
i'm sure we're going to see a lot more

543
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:55,360
of what we call as supply chain attacks

544
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:56,640
if we don't have the right kind of

545
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:59,600
visibility into the environment

546
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:00,799
actually anybody else want to add

547
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:04,158
anything to that before we move on

548
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:08,240
all right looks like we're clear so um

549
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,559
a little bit of a technology or solution

550
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:12,159
focus question but i think it's an

551
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:14,880
interesting one um you know in security

552
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:15,600
we

553
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,440
in acquiring technology to protect

554
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:20,240
ourselves you know across devices and

555
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:22,799
networks and and systems

556
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:24,640
we're always chasing new developments

557
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,559
new technologies i mentioned the silver

558
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:29,440
bullet already related to supply chain

559
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:31,120
our industry the technology industry is

560
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:33,679
really good at inventing silver bullets

561
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:35,360
maybe we haven't found any werewolves

562
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:37,120
yet is

563
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:38,720
the problem because they don't seem to

564
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:42,000
they don't seem to do the job but uh

565
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,320
so everyone's looking at now at xdr

566
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:46,559
cloud delivered security sassy zero

567
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:48,960
trust architectures whatever

568
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:50,400
sec devops

569
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,159
but how important are the basics of

570
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:54,400
infosec hygiene um vulnerability

571
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,240
management patching

572
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:58,400
knowing how many assets like how many

573
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,080
people know how many devices in that

574
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:01,440
their house are even connected to the

575
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,440
network and what are those devices um

576
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:05,280
you know we've been chasing that problem

577
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:07,360
in the enterprise forever basic logging

578
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:09,840
and monitoring practices uh password

579
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:11,919
management you know all of the boring

580
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:13,919
stuff that we stopped talking about a

581
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:16,320
long time ago how uh how important do

582
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:18,080
you guys think that stuff is

583
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:20,000
maybe grifter if you want to kick off

584
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,640
sure um yeah i think actually that's

585
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:24,480
that's probably what will help us with

586
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,400
some of these things like supply chain

587
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:29,679
attacks where um you are you you do give

588
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:31,440
a a certain amount of trust to an

589
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,360
organization um when you're using their

590
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:35,840
products and um

591
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:37,600
but if you know what's going on you're

592
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,840
on your network or on your hosts if you

593
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:40,960
know what's happening in your

594
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:43,919
environment doing things like baselining

595
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:46,159
your environment and saying this is what

596
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:47,520
uh you know

597
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:48,799
this is what it looks like when things

598
00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:50,400
are good and we don't have an attacker

599
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,159
here and then you see that kind of thing

600
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:53,360
change

601
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:54,960
that's what's going to help you in in

602
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:56,720
that case and that's a very fundamental

603
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:58,720
very basic thing what are the devices on

604
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:00,320
my network and what are they

605
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:02,799
communicating to right if you see a new

606
00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:04,799
um you know endpoint talking to an

607
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:06,559
endpoint that it's never spoken to

608
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:08,080
before

609
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:10,799
why is that right or a user logs into a

610
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:12,400
machine they've never logged in before

611
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,080
you're like those credentials have never

612
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:16,400
touched that machine why is that these

613
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:19,280
are basic things and so

614
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:20,640
i think that's the kind of stuff that

615
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:23,200
will help us even when we are putting

616
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,880
our trust in in

617
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,799
you know a an application because it's

618
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:29,200
signed by a vendor that we believe in

619
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:31,039
right if we know

620
00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:32,720
you know um if we put some of the same

621
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,559
practices that we put into place when

622
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:36,799
we're looking at um you know living off

623
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:38,320
the land attacks where we're like oh

624
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:39,760
they're using the tools that are built

625
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:42,159
into our operating system okay but

626
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:44,960
does that user ever use those tools

627
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,640
should those tools ever talk to these

628
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,640
things it's that kind of fundamental

629
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:51,280
security stuff that

630
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:53,600
that's hopefully gonna save us and and

631
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,600
the thing is some there are you know

632
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,039
advancements in technology that will

633
00:22:57,039 --> 00:22:59,760
allow us to do that things like uh user

634
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:01,520
and entity behavioral analytics where we

635
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:03,440
can baseline our environment and then

636
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:05,520
say tell me when something changes and

637
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:07,360
then we point our threat hunters at that

638
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:09,600
and say hey go look at those changes and

639
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:10,799
see if there's something that i need to

640
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:12,720
be worried about um

641
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,240
the fundamentals are what will get us

642
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:15,600
out of this

643
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,600
yeah i mentioned in our prep call there

644
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:19,280
was some piece of data that dropped

645
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:21,760
recently about um you know surprise

646
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:23,280
surprise the number one source of

647
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:25,039
vulnerability and attacks in the cloud

648
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:26,880
is configuring cloud configuration

649
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:29,039
management and it was like

650
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:31,120
uh that that article was like the

651
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:33,039
slow-moving steamroller and austin

652
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:35,440
powers you know coming at us like we

653
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:37,440
know it's coming eventually we're going

654
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:38,960
to have to hear somebody say it out loud

655
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:40,880
but we were hoping maybe it would be

656
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:43,760
different um lydia do you have any any

657
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:45,360
additional thoughts

658
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:48,240
yeah i do thanks for asking um i

659
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:49,520
actually don't think it's important i

660
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:51,919
think it's critical um the i think the

661
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:54,400
challenge that we have is that it's it's

662
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:57,360
boring it's boring you know system admin

663
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:00,480
or network admin type controls and even

664
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,480
down to the security level and i don't

665
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:04,880
think you know some you don't get your

666
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:06,960
kicks in it as much but i think it's

667
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:08,640
just as important as cleaning the house

668
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:11,120
or finding the holes that need to be

669
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:13,600
plugged up in your house and i mean if i

670
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:15,760
forgive an example a couple of years ago

671
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:18,000
i did some pretty intensive research on

672
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,080
ransomware and malware

673
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:21,440
and the impact that it had on the

674
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:22,720
endpoints

675
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:24,159
and it was really interesting just

676
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:26,559
seeing if certain

677
00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:28,720
hygiene or certain controls or

678
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,480
configuration had been put on those

679
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:35,039
endpoints a lot of those malware

680
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:36,880
types would not have escaped that

681
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,080
endpoint

682
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:40,559
and i mean if you take

683
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:42,240
my mind's gone back a while if you take

684
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:44,159
the um the

685
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:46,400
eternal blue exploit which when was that

686
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,640
two three four years ago i remember i

687
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:51,120
was working for a company and it was

688
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:52,559
just really interesting watching the

689
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:54,880
exploit bounce from unpatched system to

690
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,960
unpatched system and then when when you

691
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:59,520
tried to do a reconciliation of

692
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:01,440
what are our assets what are the patch

693
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:03,520
levels that they're up to oh my gosh i

694
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:05,120
didn't even know i had a windows legacy

695
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:07,360
machine there there's some real real

696
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:09,600
challenges you know even something is a

697
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:11,120
flat network

698
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:12,240
you know because we all want to

699
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:13,840
integrate with the different states or

700
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:15,279
countries or whatever so it makes sense

701
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:18,799
to have a flat network you know maybe

702
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:20,640
but when you're not implementing basic

703
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,480
hygiene practices

704
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:24,320
it is going to you know bite you in the

705
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:27,360
bum type thing because

706
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:29,279
even when you're looking at basic you

707
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:31,840
know security bypass research or all

708
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:34,159
those sorts of things

709
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:35,679
that's how those security breaches

710
00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:37,840
happen and if we implement good hygiene

711
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:40,320
you've got that security prevention

712
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:42,960
happening and i guess the harder thing

713
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:45,120
to the harder thing is when you're

714
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:47,600
looking at defensive security all those

715
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:49,600
prevention mechanisms

716
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:51,360
how do you then say yes we're doing a

717
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:53,520
good job because we stopped blah you

718
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:54,640
can't

719
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:56,400
the metrics around that and trying to

720
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:59,120
support that work of you know cyber

721
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:00,400
hygiene whether it's vulnerability

722
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:03,120
management or like creating a cmdb or

723
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:05,039
logging or monitoring it's really hard

724
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:07,919
to put matrix metrics and success wins

725
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:09,039
across that

726
00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:11,360
at all as opposed to

727
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:13,200
reactive security where this thing

728
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:14,720
happened and look we were able to catch

729
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:17,120
it in 24 hours you don't see that with

730
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:19,600
basic hygiene and so it's not fun and

731
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:21,520
sexy you know for those defenders that

732
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:23,600
are doing that sort of work but it is

733
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:25,279
absolutely critical that we need to

734
00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:27,760
focus on it

735
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:29,200
excellent um does anybody else want to

736
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:30,880
add anything

737
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:33,039
yeah if i may i do

738
00:26:33,039 --> 00:26:35,840
yeah all right we'll go vitaly first

739
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:38,080
all right thank you uh just uh i wanted

740
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:41,039
to add that uh this recent trends like

741
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:43,039
moving everything to the cloud or or

742
00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:45,600
putting all the apps in the containers

743
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:48,080
it's been quite um you know alarming to

744
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:51,039
me because i i see how people how people

745
00:26:51,039 --> 00:26:52,559
treat this how people

746
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:55,279
you know perceive this and it feels like

747
00:26:55,279 --> 00:26:56,880
uh when

748
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:58,720
people moving infrastructure services to

749
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:01,039
the cloud they kind of removing

750
00:27:01,039 --> 00:27:03,120
responsibility from bridges from their

751
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:04,880
shoulders and putting it on shoulders of

752
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:07,520
those providers that you know serve them

753
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:10,640
and they like escaping uh trying to

754
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:14,159
escape uh doing their security rights so

755
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:16,559
in my opinion security fundamentals are

756
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:18,159
unavoidable so you have to do it

757
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:20,799
everywhere regardless of whose services

758
00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:22,559
you are using you have to take care of

759
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:24,399
your infrastructure first and then you

760
00:27:24,399 --> 00:27:26,480
can explore the opportunities but with

761
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:28,559
all these trends it's just a way to

762
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:30,960
escape responsibility for for doing the

763
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:33,039
fundamentals you take another one for

764
00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:35,440
example containerization like docker and

765
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:38,000
alike uh developers tend to believe that

766
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,440
you know what's the problem if there is

767
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:41,440
a security vulnerability it's it's a

768
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:43,279
disposable container anyway i'm going

769
00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:45,679
just to to you know cue and respawn that

770
00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:47,360
container from the clean state and

771
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:48,960
there's another problem even if there's

772
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:51,840
a security back they treat it this way

773
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:53,200
and i think that

774
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:55,760
they started to miss out on

775
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:57,919
implementing things right and and

776
00:27:57,919 --> 00:27:59,520
writing the clean code without the

777
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:01,360
vulnerabilities introduced you don't

778
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:03,600
consider like threats such as you know

779
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:05,679
is

780
00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:08,559
skip and things like that and this is i

781
00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:10,320
think this is negatively impacting

782
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:12,960
overall global security of all services

783
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:15,520
and the whole world basically so we

784
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:17,360
shall not escape the fundamentals we

785
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:19,200
shall you know spend our time do our

786
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:21,679
homework and invest in fundamentals

787
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:24,080
first and then explore the opportunities

788
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:26,399
that new services bring to us

789
00:28:26,399 --> 00:28:29,120
excellent vanda

790
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:31,840
um i would just um add on to what uh

791
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:34,000
lydia and vitelli said

792
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,120
like

793
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:37,039
they have talked about from the consumer

794
00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:39,200
side now there is one point that vendors

795
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:41,760
can also do like every vendor cloud

796
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:44,399
provider is doing things their own way

797
00:28:44,399 --> 00:28:46,880
and the only way to move forward is

798
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:49,279
combined effort by all of the vendors

799
00:28:49,279 --> 00:28:51,039
toward the unified framework of

800
00:28:51,039 --> 00:28:52,080
monitoring

801
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:53,760
because when we talk about uh

802
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:56,159
misconfiguration that has been there and

803
00:28:56,159 --> 00:28:58,399
that will be there so

804
00:28:58,399 --> 00:29:00,080
if we don't have the combined efforts by

805
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:02,080
the vendors as well the breaches will

806
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:05,600
happen and uh whatever we will do we

807
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:09,600
will not be able to monitor them enough

808
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:10,960
yeah absolutely and i mean it's

809
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:12,480
interesting

810
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:15,200
the what the cloud did for

811
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:17,200
um you know

812
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:19,279
enabling functionality in it and

813
00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:21,039
networks is kind of like

814
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:22,000
um

815
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,840
you know the the development of the

816
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:25,600
cloud now makes it easier to develop

817
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:28,480
everything faster and unfortunately

818
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:31,279
security is the most difficult part you

819
00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:33,039
know to get on board quickly but we have

820
00:29:33,039 --> 00:29:35,600
this established pattern in it that if

821
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:38,720
we can connect something we will

822
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:41,039
and if and if connecting something makes

823
00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:43,039
a process more efficient it will happen

824
00:29:43,039 --> 00:29:44,960
and then we will figure everything else

825
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:47,440
out later and i think the problem of

826
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:49,360
that is compounded in the cloud because

827
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:51,840
of the pace of development that that now

828
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:53,520
we need to have a feedback loop in the

829
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:56,399
development process for security um

830
00:29:56,399 --> 00:29:58,720
all right so let's move on to well let's

831
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:00,159
see there's a couple different areas

832
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:01,840
with directions we could go here we

833
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:03,600
could stick to the cloud

834
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:04,880
but i do want to make sure to talk about

835
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:07,440
a few other things um one is i watched a

836
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:08,960
few sessions today that that were sort

837
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:11,360
of outside the technical world one was

838
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:12,640
about um

839
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:15,039
you know how security events is driving

840
00:30:15,039 --> 00:30:17,039
changes in stocks in the stock market

841
00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:18,559
and you know

842
00:30:18,559 --> 00:30:19,919
and that's a real thing that's actually

843
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:21,520
happening and then the other was about

844
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:25,360
um attracting uh um you know good folks

845
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:27,600
to enter the industry particularly in

846
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:31,039
ape in asia pacific where um you know

847
00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:32,880
the relationship between citizens and

848
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:35,039
their governments is different than what

849
00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:36,960
i'm used to in in the united states in

850
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:39,679
some cases um and it's been hard it's

851
00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:41,440
hard there's a challenge to attract

852
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:43,840
talent um because they're afraid of

853
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:45,679
doing things that are potentially

854
00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:48,399
illegal for work um which is a totally

855
00:30:48,399 --> 00:30:50,399
legitimate thing to worry about but what

856
00:30:50,399 --> 00:30:52,559
do you guys think about this whole

857
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:55,279
concept of the skills gap that the real

858
00:30:55,279 --> 00:30:57,600
brick wall in security is that by

859
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:59,519
whatever estimate there are three or

860
00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:02,720
four million open unfilled positions

861
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:04,880
how do we how do we get past that uh is

862
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:06,720
that is it

863
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:08,240
you know training programs and

864
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:10,240
attracting more people or is it

865
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:12,880
technology that reduces the need for as

866
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:14,640
many people or a mix of both what do you

867
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:17,360
guys see um i'll go ahead and start with

868
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:20,159
uh lydia on that one

869
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:22,080
oh um

870
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:25,120
obviously it's hard to comment on um the

871
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:27,279
number of job opportunities versus

872
00:31:27,279 --> 00:31:29,679
people looking so if there's a skills

873
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:31,840
gap it's it's really hard to make a

874
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:33,039
comment because that's obviously

875
00:31:33,039 --> 00:31:35,919
something i can't comment on but i think

876
00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:37,840
yeah and i think um i think the

877
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:39,679
challenge that we face is

878
00:31:39,679 --> 00:31:41,840
people of our age group fell into

879
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:44,399
security you know when we when we

880
00:31:44,399 --> 00:31:46,720
entered security um you know we were

881
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:49,519
doing degrees in computer science or

882
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:51,360
software engineering or whatever and we

883
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:53,120
all started out as developers or

884
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:55,760
database admins or whatever

885
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:58,399
and i know for me i was an ex-developer

886
00:31:58,399 --> 00:32:00,159
and i got into security because i was

887
00:32:00,159 --> 00:32:02,159
developing something for security and

888
00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:04,559
then the rest is the rest is downhill

889
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:07,519
and i know in the past probably earlier

890
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:08,159
on

891
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:09,519
when i was interviewing i was looking

892
00:32:09,519 --> 00:32:10,960
for myself

893
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:13,279
because we do everything perfectly right

894
00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:15,200
that's not what it's about that's not

895
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:17,039
what it's about you know it's you know

896
00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:19,120
it's it's the diversity and it's not

897
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:22,159
about women diversity it's the diversity

898
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:24,240
diversity in thought so

899
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:25,200
um

900
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:28,000
when we talk about um the gender skills

901
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,559
gap or sorry sorry the skills gap um i

902
00:32:30,559 --> 00:32:31,840
want to put it out there that i think

903
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:34,960
the pandemic has actually

904
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:38,640
had so many benefits from the sense that

905
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:40,320
you know you might be looking for

906
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:41,679
someone that can come into the office

907
00:32:41,679 --> 00:32:42,880
every day

908
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:45,200
well then no you know we there's now

909
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:47,440
people that basically are living in

910
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:49,200
different states different countries

911
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:51,200
that can fill that gap so now we're

912
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:53,679
being open to go okay so perhaps there's

913
00:32:53,679 --> 00:32:55,600
not someone in the state that i live in

914
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:57,760
that can make the 40-minute train ride

915
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:59,120
to work but maybe there's somebody in

916
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:01,039
another state that can actually fill

917
00:33:01,039 --> 00:33:02,399
that gap

918
00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:05,519
and i think that that that the pandemic

919
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:07,919
has really shaped the way that we employ

920
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:10,320
as well or even to the perspective that

921
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:12,480
hey i've really decided that i hate

922
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:14,480
living in the city and i now want to

923
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:16,320
live by the beach or i now want to live

924
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:18,240
in the bush or in the country

925
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:20,080
and companies are really

926
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:23,519
supporting their employees to do that

927
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:26,080
and so i think um i think those things

928
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:27,440
are changing too and i think something

929
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:29,440
that londoner should talk about late

930
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:31,360
especially with infosec girls but i know

931
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:33,360
for the australian women in security

932
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:36,240
network that we have here in australia

933
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:37,519
we've got

934
00:33:37,519 --> 00:33:40,480
women cadets that we're trying to

935
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:43,840
build them up um do free training

936
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:45,600
build that confidence because it's one

937
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:48,399
thing to have a formal education but

938
00:33:48,399 --> 00:33:50,159
it's another thing to show that

939
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:52,559
experience and that confidence and i

940
00:33:52,559 --> 00:33:53,919
think that you know we've got so many

941
00:33:53,919 --> 00:33:55,760
great initiatives the work that london

942
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:58,480
is doing in her um you know in her spare

943
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:00,159
time the some of the things that we're

944
00:34:00,159 --> 00:34:02,080
doing for blackout the mentoring program

945
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:03,919
when we are face to face

946
00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:06,000
um a lot of the b sides now are

947
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,560
mentoring people as well to help them

948
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:09,918
feel confident

949
00:34:09,918 --> 00:34:10,879
um

950
00:34:10,879 --> 00:34:12,560
i know friends and i we've delivered

951
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:15,440
free um vulnerability management classes

952
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:17,199
so that people understand about asset

953
00:34:17,199 --> 00:34:20,320
management and data classification and

954
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:22,480
it allows them just to allow people to

955
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:25,040
see real hands-on how it's done in the

956
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:27,599
industry and i think that

957
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:30,320
that's really closing the gap if you

958
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:32,800
want to call it between the formal

959
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:34,719
education and getting that experience so

960
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:36,320
that someone can attend an interview and

961
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:38,159
say this is what i'm doing this is this

962
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:39,599
is how i can contribute i think i've

963
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:40,960
spoken on that because i know everyone's

964
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:43,280
got more things to say but literally if

965
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:45,760
i talk about this for ages yeah no

966
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:47,839
problem grifter i'm going back around

967
00:34:47,839 --> 00:34:50,079
this sure no yeah that's uh like that's

968
00:34:50,079 --> 00:34:52,000
just passion don't worry about it i love

969
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,399
it um but i think that's the thing is

970
00:34:54,399 --> 00:34:56,560
that we um

971
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:59,119
like your passion the way that you just

972
00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:01,040
talked about that lydia is

973
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:03,280
is kind of what um

974
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:06,079
may be hampering us a little bit as as

975
00:35:06,079 --> 00:35:09,280
an industry because i know i share that

976
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:12,000
same passion like when when i'm done

977
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,920
doing this i'm going to watch more talks

978
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:15,599
i'm going to do more security things

979
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:19,280
like i am a hacker from from the day i

980
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:21,520
was born right and

981
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:23,200
i think a lot of us who have come into

982
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:24,880
this industry that way

983
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:26,480
um almost have

984
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:28,640
expectations that everybody's gonna be

985
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:30,640
that way and that's just not the case

986
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:32,960
some people don't want to do what they

987
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:34,800
do at work when they go home right they

988
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,720
don't want to work the super long hours

989
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:38,480
they don't want to continue doing

990
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:40,480
research or speak at conferences or do

991
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:42,560
these other things that

992
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:45,119
come with our industry and so sometimes

993
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:46,720
we have expectations where we bring

994
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:47,839
somebody in

995
00:35:47,839 --> 00:35:49,680
uh for an entry level position and we're

996
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:51,680
like well what projects do you do and

997
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:53,280
what other things are you working on and

998
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:54,640
what's your involvement in your local

999
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:56,480
hackerspace and how often have you been

1000
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:58,880
to defcon and what about

1001
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:01,280
b-sides and you present places those are

1002
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:03,839
all fantastic things but if we hold

1003
00:36:03,839 --> 00:36:05,760
everybody to that standard and we're

1004
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:07,599
like okay come in you're interviewing

1005
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:09,920
for this position on our

1006
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:11,040
red team

1007
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:12,720
and its entry level and we're like pop

1008
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:14,960
all these boxes right like it's just

1009
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:16,240
it's not

1010
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:19,520
no it scares people off um and what we

1011
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:22,000
should be doing is bringing people in in

1012
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,079
those entry level positions and then

1013
00:36:24,079 --> 00:36:26,000
giving them on the job training or

1014
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
fostering that um

1015
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,680
you know the knowledge that they have

1016
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:33,359
and growing it um by sharing our passion

1017
00:36:33,359 --> 00:36:35,440
with them instead of just expecting them

1018
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:37,359
to to come

1019
00:36:37,359 --> 00:36:40,400
ready to crush everything on day one um

1020
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:42,880
we have a very cool industry it is cool

1021
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:45,599
i like i don't tell people what i do if

1022
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:47,200
i'm on a plane because i don't want to

1023
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:49,200
get into a giant conversation about it

1024
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:51,680
right like so um

1025
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:53,920
so it's it is a cool industry and it

1026
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:56,400
does attract people but i think um our

1027
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:58,400
expectations sometimes of those

1028
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:00,560
employees are a little bit high we burn

1029
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:03,359
them out fast or we scare them away and

1030
00:37:03,359 --> 00:37:04,800
so um

1031
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,320
yeah we just have to be careful with

1032
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:07,839
things like that i don't know i didn't

1033
00:37:07,839 --> 00:37:09,520
mean to be a downer on that one i guess

1034
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:12,560
but but i'm just like just being real

1035
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:14,640
that's good self reset reflection from

1036
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:17,040
the inside though because because then

1037
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:18,480
there are ways that you could take steps

1038
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:19,839
to change that look i mean i think the

1039
00:37:19,839 --> 00:37:22,640
perfect pipeline into into infosec is

1040
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:26,400
gaming and i i can talk to a teenager

1041
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:27,760
for five minutes about their

1042
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:29,839
understanding of video game systems and

1043
00:37:29,839 --> 00:37:31,599
know very quickly whether or not they'll

1044
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:34,160
be successful down the road in this job

1045
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:36,880
what we need to do is also allow for

1046
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:39,040
them to be the gamer personalities at

1047
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:42,320
work which is obsessive but also

1048
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:44,800
lazy and disconnected and

1049
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:45,839
you know that

1050
00:37:45,839 --> 00:37:47,760
and and have those lower you know those

1051
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:49,280
lower expectations and it's a really

1052
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:50,400
interesting point

1053
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:52,400
um vitali is there anything you want to

1054
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:53,760
add

1055
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:55,440
yeah as far as you you brought up the

1056
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:57,760
video gaming and and i really got this

1057
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:00,160
question quite uh a lot in the past by

1058
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:02,160
the media because i did interact with

1059
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:04,079
the gaming companies advise them on

1060
00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:06,880
implementing some security tricks in the

1061
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:09,440
in the script of the games but uh the

1062
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:11,280
point is i always ask like

1063
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:13,200
do you play video games and i had to

1064
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:15,440
explain that i don't really i used to

1065
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:17,599
play but since i joined infosacc i don't

1066
00:38:17,599 --> 00:38:19,680
have to because you know all my work or

1067
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:22,960
my job is one big ever-ending video game

1068
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:25,200
so we're chasing bad guys they're trying

1069
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:27,359
to counter-attack and things like that

1070
00:38:27,359 --> 00:38:30,000
and uh yeah it's just really thrilling

1071
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,560
job and like christopher said it doesn't

1072
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:35,359
end with your end of the work day it

1073
00:38:35,359 --> 00:38:38,320
continues over and over at night in the

1074
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:39,920
morning it doesn't matter what time it

1075
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:41,920
is whether this is holiday or weekend it

1076
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:44,400
doesn't matter i mean it's fun and you

1077
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:46,640
can really

1078
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:48,079
really air on the right track into

1079
00:38:48,079 --> 00:38:50,560
infrastructure don't be very formal

1080
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:52,800
and another thing i wanted to add if you

1081
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:54,880
want to explore this topic especially on

1082
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:59,040
the shortage of uh you know stuff uh in

1083
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:01,680
cyber security it was an excellent talk

1084
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:05,920
delivered yesterday by uh our

1085
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:08,560
uh our colleague uh part of the review

1086
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:10,320
board of black hatation and niko

1087
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:12,400
devonshire so if you missed that talk i

1088
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:14,240
do recommend let me just bring up this

1089
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:16,000
slide from here

1090
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,079
if you see it but maybe it's cut out

1091
00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:19,839
anyway i just go back and see the

1092
00:39:19,839 --> 00:39:22,160
recording uh because she brought up a

1093
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:26,079
very important um questions uh like what

1094
00:39:26,079 --> 00:39:28,720
are the drivers and and kind of uh

1095
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:30,240
distractions

1096
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:31,119
from

1097
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:33,119
joining the infosec from the young

1098
00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:34,960
generation because she she interrupted

1099
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:37,200
and lectured in a university she talked

1100
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:39,119
with students a lot so she kind of

1101
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:40,800
studied this question and tried to

1102
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:42,640
understand like what uh what are the

1103
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:45,119
psychological barriers from from joining

1104
00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:46,480
infosec

1105
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:49,520
and um you know having enough of stuff

1106
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:52,880
um and she also gives a very wise um

1107
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:54,400
say um

1108
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:58,480
advice uh or or uh hint of how to do it

1109
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:00,400
right not to get in trouble how not to

1110
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:03,520
be scared of of breaking the law uh

1111
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:06,079
accidentally and um she does it very

1112
00:40:06,079 --> 00:40:08,240
very right delivered very on point so i

1113
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:09,920
do recommend to revisit that if you

1114
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:11,839
missed it yeah yeah that was the session

1115
00:40:11,839 --> 00:40:13,440
i was referring to as well it was really

1116
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:16,000
it was really interesting

1117
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,480
uh and then last but not least when

1118
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:20,480
donna

1119
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:21,359
sure

1120
00:40:21,359 --> 00:40:25,200
um so as my fellow speakers said people

1121
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:27,359
want to be there but a lot of times

1122
00:40:27,359 --> 00:40:30,000
they're not welcomed the over uh the

1123
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,160
oral mindset of learning to learn new

1124
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:34,319
things needs to be taught so that they

1125
00:40:34,319 --> 00:40:37,040
can feel welcomed like uh

1126
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:38,800
gritter said that

1127
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:40,960
we expect people to learn from the very

1128
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:43,280
first day which is not easy

1129
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:44,800
for any one of us

1130
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:46,480
individuals from different domains

1131
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:47,920
should be able to learn and join the

1132
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:50,640
cyber security force workforce and

1133
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:54,240
people here are very much uh

1134
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:56,079
into the zone wherein they want to share

1135
00:40:56,079 --> 00:40:57,200
information

1136
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:59,520
but we need to understand a point

1137
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:01,680
wherein we need to welcome them at the

1138
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:02,800
same time

1139
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:04,720
while we all are in this profession it's

1140
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:06,960
out of our passion like totally

1141
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:08,720
not everyone here will be for the

1142
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:10,640
passion so we need to create an

1143
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:13,520
ecosystem where we people can learn the

1144
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:16,400
skills and join the workforce and

1145
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:18,560
when i talk about diversity

1146
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:20,720
when i started my own initiative and for

1147
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:23,520
like uh i started info centers or uh

1148
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:26,240
rejuvenated in for say girls uh the the

1149
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:27,680
point was that we need to have more

1150
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:30,640
women power but i feel it's not to do

1151
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:33,200
with just the gender diversity but we

1152
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:35,359
need to have skill diversity and as

1153
00:41:35,359 --> 00:41:37,599
lydia said thoughts diversity we need to

1154
00:41:37,599 --> 00:41:39,599
consider people who are developers

1155
00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:41,920
testers uh people who are not from the

1156
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:44,240
regular pool of the candidates that we

1157
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:46,400
look for like we need a people who only

1158
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:48,079
we need a person who is five years in

1159
00:41:48,079 --> 00:41:50,000
the industry but

1160
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,839
maybe reach out to universities maybe

1161
00:41:51,839 --> 00:41:53,760
reach out to remote cities maybe reach

1162
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:56,119
out to communities and create

1163
00:41:56,119 --> 00:41:58,400
opportunities for everyone

1164
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:01,119
like uh the saying goes talent is

1165
00:42:01,119 --> 00:42:03,839
distributed equally but opportunities

1166
00:42:03,839 --> 00:42:05,839
are not so that's what we have to look

1167
00:42:05,839 --> 00:42:08,480
at at the moment

1168
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:10,400
excellent yeah um yeah really

1169
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:12,560
interesting conversation i i still feel

1170
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:15,280
like uh with two teenagers in the house

1171
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:16,960
i keep telling them based on their

1172
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:20,319
ability to operate uh you know discord

1173
00:42:20,319 --> 00:42:22,640
and you know whatever six games they're

1174
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:25,200
playing and consume three twitch feeds

1175
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:27,280
and then you know you know figure out

1176
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:28,800
how to get their character you know

1177
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:30,560
maximum strength for the fastest

1178
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:32,560
possible kills it's like all right i

1179
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:34,319
know what you guys should be doing

1180
00:42:34,319 --> 00:42:35,920
you just you get to do it against real

1181
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:38,560
people so uh i'm curious to see if

1182
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:40,319
that's uh something that

1183
00:42:40,319 --> 00:42:41,760
i've never really thought about looking

1184
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:43,599
into industry organizations was

1185
00:42:43,599 --> 00:42:44,800
specifically that in mind but i'm

1186
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:46,800
curious to see if they're out there um

1187
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:48,880
all right so another big picture topic

1188
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:50,319
um we have some questions from the

1189
00:42:50,319 --> 00:42:52,240
audience and i'm going to save the last

1190
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:54,960
10 minutes or so to go through those um

1191
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:57,520
but obviously then you know the the

1192
00:42:57,520 --> 00:42:59,599
nation-state attack has been the thing

1193
00:42:59,599 --> 00:43:01,599
since you know networks first existed

1194
00:43:01,599 --> 00:43:03,680
some of the very first networks were

1195
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:05,760
military and government networks in the

1196
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:07,920
first place and so the idea that they

1197
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:09,920
contained useful information or things

1198
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:12,240
that that attackers might want

1199
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:13,520
is not new

1200
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:15,599
but we are certainly seeing an

1201
00:43:15,599 --> 00:43:18,160
escalation in the amount of conversation

1202
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:19,839
about it because of all the coordinated

1203
00:43:19,839 --> 00:43:22,160
disinformation campaigns so part of it

1204
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:24,480
is hacking stealing you know it's

1205
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:26,560
stuxnet or whatever else but the other

1206
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:28,880
part of it is the subtle manipulation of

1207
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:31,200
public sentiment using you know using

1208
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:34,000
the internet um great talk

1209
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,640
at black hat usa there was a big focus

1210
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:38,480
because the election was coming up from

1211
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:40,560
the stanford internet observatory about

1212
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:43,440
this exact topic um so what do you think

1213
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:46,079
as an as an employee at a company and

1214
00:43:46,079 --> 00:43:47,760
your job is to help make that company

1215
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:49,599
secure what do you think is the larger

1216
00:43:49,599 --> 00:43:51,839
role of cyber security professionals in

1217
00:43:51,839 --> 00:43:54,640
this you know heavily politicized world

1218
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:57,200
of attacks is it something you think is

1219
00:43:57,200 --> 00:43:59,200
this another possible inhibitor like

1220
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:00,400
does a person think well i don't want to

1221
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:02,000
get into cyber security because i don't

1222
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,680
have to deal with like you know what if

1223
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:05,760
i find some attack from another country

1224
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:07,280
and i end up on you know somebody's

1225
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:09,119
radar it's like it's like another

1226
00:44:09,119 --> 00:44:10,800
potential barrier but what do you think

1227
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:12,720
what do you think the role of the of a

1228
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:14,720
infosec professional is in in in

1229
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:16,800
politics um

1230
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:19,280
grifter we'll go ahead and hit you first

1231
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:22,079
i'm like are you insane like that's what

1232
00:44:22,079 --> 00:44:22,730
a question

1233
00:44:22,730 --> 00:44:26,160
[Laughter]

1234
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:27,920
you know honestly

1235
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:30,400
i think that um

1236
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:32,560
our role should be more

1237
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:35,280
enablers than we are um people often

1238
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:36,560
look at

1239
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:38,880
the security team as the people who are

1240
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:40,400
always telling them

1241
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:42,800
they can't do something right

1242
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:45,280
um or they're not allowed to do it and

1243
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:48,000
and i think that that that has to change

1244
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,079
um the everybody's talking about

1245
00:44:50,079 --> 00:44:52,720
security everybody is watching it on the

1246
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:55,200
news all the time you can't open up your

1247
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:56,960
browser without seeing another news

1248
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:59,119
story about some ransomware campaign or

1249
00:44:59,119 --> 00:45:00,480
whatever and so

1250
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:02,400
um we can be educators and we can be

1251
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:04,160
enablers or we can be the person who

1252
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:06,400
tells them no all the time and you know

1253
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:09,440
i'd i'd rather be the first so

1254
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:11,040
yeah i mean it isn't you're in an

1255
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:12,480
interesting position because there are

1256
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:14,240
not very many jobs that you could go to

1257
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:16,079
school for or not whatever learn how to

1258
00:45:16,079 --> 00:45:18,880
do and then end up being jack ryan one

1259
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:20,560
day just because of something that

1260
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:22,480
happens that you know something that

1261
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:24,880
happens to your company that's part of a

1262
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:27,200
nation-state campaign and it's a you're

1263
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:28,800
in this weird position to maybe like

1264
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:31,440
self-deputize and you know or become a

1265
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:33,040
hero um

1266
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:35,040
uh vitaly what are you what are your

1267
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:36,640
thoughts on this issue i'm sure you have

1268
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:38,400
some

1269
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:40,720
yeah definitely we were in this turmoil

1270
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:44,000
a few times in the past and um what

1271
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,480
i have to say is what helped us uh i

1272
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:49,680
think is um keeping neutrality um being

1273
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:52,400
solid uh being listened to pretty much

1274
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:54,720
everyone regardless of who is attacking

1275
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:56,880
you what are their motives with their

1276
00:45:56,880 --> 00:45:58,480
servant their country whether they are

1277
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:00,400
maybe terrorists in another country

1278
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:02,800
it doesn't really matter i mean you just

1279
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:05,040
deal with cyber attacks we you you

1280
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:07,040
prevent them you help people defend

1281
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:08,480
against them regardless where they are

1282
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:10,400
coming from and what what are their

1283
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:13,520
intentions um we of course know that and

1284
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:15,200
it was concerned several times that the

1285
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:16,960
nation-state uh

1286
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:19,599
malware or implants were abused or

1287
00:46:19,599 --> 00:46:21,839
vulnerabilities were used for nefarious

1288
00:46:21,839 --> 00:46:24,000
purposes by by criminals and they were

1289
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:27,200
adopted and reused repurposed and this

1290
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:30,640
is happening so we we cannot really um

1291
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:33,440
count on attribution as well this is

1292
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:36,079
important point to bring up i think uh i

1293
00:46:36,079 --> 00:46:38,560
think ever since we had this attack on

1294
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:41,760
olympic games in south korea 2018 i

1295
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:43,200
think there was an olympic destroyer

1296
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:45,520
campaign that tricked the whole industry

1297
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:48,079
into believing that it was somebody else

1298
00:46:48,079 --> 00:46:50,480
but it was like very carefully crafted

1299
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:52,720
campaign of this information that

1300
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:54,800
tricked a lot of security researchers in

1301
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:57,040
doing a wrong attribution

1302
00:46:57,040 --> 00:47:00,400
so um ever since then i think uh we kind

1303
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:01,200
of

1304
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:03,119
stopped completely stopped attributing

1305
00:47:03,119 --> 00:47:05,119
to particular entities because we always

1306
00:47:05,119 --> 00:47:07,359
leave uh more and more

1307
00:47:07,359 --> 00:47:12,319
chance for uh very like smart evil

1308
00:47:12,319 --> 00:47:14,640
disinformation campaign like false

1309
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:17,359
flagging in in a very engineering ways

1310
00:47:17,359 --> 00:47:20,160
um so you have to consider that and be

1311
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:21,680
neutral uh

1312
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:25,200
be ethical and be nice to to everyone i

1313
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:27,520
think that's the way to go otherwise

1314
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:29,440
it's just going to be a start of uh i

1315
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:32,240
know new cold war between you know major

1316
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:33,920
powers in the world if we get

1317
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:36,559
politicized too much yeah

1318
00:47:36,559 --> 00:47:40,160
anybody else want to jump in on that one

1319
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:42,640
i forgot what the question was again

1320
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:44,160
i think we covered it pretty well and we

1321
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:46,160
have just about nine minutes left and we

1322
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:48,240
have some questions from the audience uh

1323
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:50,800
first one is um sort of malware focus so

1324
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:52,640
i'm guessing vitaly but i'm sure other

1325
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:54,640
people will have thoughts

1326
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:57,520
ransomware malware has refocused on

1327
00:47:57,520 --> 00:47:59,520
crypto for the last six to nine months

1328
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:02,079
is it just price a price based shift or

1329
00:48:02,079 --> 00:48:04,480
is there anything more underlying uh

1330
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:07,839
causing the shift

1331
00:48:07,839 --> 00:48:10,400
well um ransomware has been something

1332
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:12,480
that to be honest my first message when

1333
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:14,880
i i pushed about ransomware as a serious

1334
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:16,119
threat was

1335
00:48:16,119 --> 00:48:17,680
2007

1336
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:20,400
and i i was uh sending the message like

1337
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:22,240
look guys this is going to be serious

1338
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:24,640
come on this is like we cannot really

1339
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:26,480
you know ignore it now because this will

1340
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:27,839
be a big thing

1341
00:48:27,839 --> 00:48:28,880
and

1342
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:31,520
well i think 10 years passed since uh

1343
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:33,920
you know bigger ransomware massive

1344
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:36,480
inflections appeared right so maybe it

1345
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:38,400
was too soon to send that message but it

1346
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:40,880
was the first discovery of uh you know

1347
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:43,520
asymmetrical cryptography used to

1348
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:45,760
encrypt users files and and demand the

1349
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:47,280
ransom

1350
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:50,559
so uh the ransomware evolved ever since

1351
00:48:50,559 --> 00:48:52,480
you uh from just single isolated

1352
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:54,800
campaigns uh driven by an individual

1353
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:56,800
maybe or one group it has become an

1354
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:58,079
industry where

1355
00:48:58,079 --> 00:49:00,079
it's more like uh you know malwa as a

1356
00:49:00,079 --> 00:49:02,640
service enables other groups to join

1357
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:05,680
very quickly to deploy you know the

1358
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:07,119
infrastructure data services and then

1359
00:49:07,119 --> 00:49:08,640
start hitting

1360
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:11,520
the victims and now we see completely

1361
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:13,599
new new page in this story like new

1362
00:49:13,599 --> 00:49:17,440
trend this ransomware 2.0 if you like

1363
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:18,240
which

1364
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:20,160
doesn't only encrypt your files and

1365
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:21,839
demands a ransom but but there is a

1366
00:49:21,839 --> 00:49:23,520
thread of public disclosure there so

1367
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:25,760
they are organizing these links they not

1368
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:28,839
only encrypt your data not

1369
00:49:28,839 --> 00:49:31,920
only they steal your most sensitive data

1370
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:34,000
and start clicking this they went even

1371
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,079
further and i think that what they do

1372
00:49:36,079 --> 00:49:38,240
they they secretly keep the journalists

1373
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:39,839
in the media to attract even more

1374
00:49:39,839 --> 00:49:42,640
attention to bring it to the you know

1375
00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:45,040
public uh discussion and then create

1376
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:47,040
even more pressure on those companies

1377
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:50,240
that are hesitant to pay the ransom uh

1378
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:52,319
the latest like very very latest trend

1379
00:49:52,319 --> 00:49:54,319
is they reach out even to the clients

1380
00:49:54,319 --> 00:49:56,720
and customers of those victim companies

1381
00:49:56,720 --> 00:49:58,720
so they send out these emails and say

1382
00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:00,960
and explain that look this company that

1383
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:03,440
you are using actually uh were breached

1384
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:06,000
by us and your data has been stolen and

1385
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,000
you know they you know to create this

1386
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:09,200
reputation

1387
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:11,760
of a company that is incompetent and

1388
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:14,079
they definitely ruin their their image

1389
00:50:14,079 --> 00:50:15,440
which negatively affect the whole

1390
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:18,000
business model and just with one thing

1391
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,079
to create even more pressure

1392
00:50:20,079 --> 00:50:22,960
from all sides uh on on these businesses

1393
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:25,119
so this is how ransomware involved

1394
00:50:25,119 --> 00:50:27,359
and i think that will continue evolving

1395
00:50:27,359 --> 00:50:29,359
maybe even encryption will not be the

1396
00:50:29,359 --> 00:50:32,079
the key role here but this

1397
00:50:32,079 --> 00:50:35,119
uh reputation risks and this pressure

1398
00:50:35,119 --> 00:50:37,680
points will be the key point uh they

1399
00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:39,680
would no longer need even to encrypt the

1400
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:41,920
data maybe in place that will be just

1401
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:44,079
something like less prioritized on their

1402
00:50:44,079 --> 00:50:45,359
side but they will continue these

1403
00:50:45,359 --> 00:50:47,520
operations for sure and uh

1404
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:51,680
cryptocurrency only you know they

1405
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:53,599
in this they allow them to do the

1406
00:50:53,599 --> 00:50:54,960
transactions

1407
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:57,680
like almost invisibly or anonymously at

1408
00:50:57,680 --> 00:50:58,800
least

1409
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:01,760
uh hide in the crowd use mixers and

1410
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:04,880
launderers of cryptocurrencies and

1411
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:07,680
and continue running this operation so

1412
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:10,319
uh this is not going away anytime soon

1413
00:51:10,319 --> 00:51:11,760
so it's rather

1414
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:14,000
it's better to be prepared than sorry

1415
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,720
later so make sure you you do have your

1416
00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:18,640
basic uh

1417
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:21,200
hygiene security hygiene you you do

1418
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:24,000
backups of all your critical data and

1419
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,319
you're prepared for the day x to come

1420
00:51:26,319 --> 00:51:28,079
when you are bridged with one of these

1421
00:51:28,079 --> 00:51:29,760
groups like what will be your public

1422
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:31,280
response what is your you know

1423
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:33,920
standpoint are you going to to give up

1424
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:35,359
and pay the rent or are you going to be

1425
00:51:35,359 --> 00:51:37,680
strong and show this strong image to

1426
00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:40,240
your customers to your partners that you

1427
00:51:40,240 --> 00:51:41,680
are not following the orders of the

1428
00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:43,920
blackmailers but you are fighting

1429
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:46,000
against them

1430
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:47,280
excellent anybody else have anything

1431
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:50,800
they want to add to that

1432
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:52,480
no i think that was pretty thorough all

1433
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:55,200
right another question from the audience

1434
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:57,119
uh how do you see the growth of copycat

1435
00:51:57,119 --> 00:51:59,920
attacks based on solar uh solar flare

1436
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:01,599
the idea of inserting back doors that

1437
00:52:01,599 --> 00:52:04,240
compile time poses a huge risk to many

1438
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:07,359
devops ci implementations

1439
00:52:07,359 --> 00:52:09,839
many of which don't document well or in

1440
00:52:09,839 --> 00:52:11,599
some cases don't even put their build

1441
00:52:11,599 --> 00:52:13,920
environments and tools under cm control

1442
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:15,680
do we are we going to see

1443
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:16,960
copycat

1444
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:19,839
similar attacks

1445
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:23,440
maybe like i said just just quickly uh

1446
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:25,440
it's already happened i mean uh

1447
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:27,359
solarwinds was not the first one right

1448
00:52:27,359 --> 00:52:28,960
so it's just

1449
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:30,319
one of many

1450
00:52:30,319 --> 00:52:32,559
um and there will be more with solar

1451
00:52:32,559 --> 00:52:34,800
winds it just was so big and it made it

1452
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:37,440
to the news everywhere it's become such

1453
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:39,680
a serious problem that i think there

1454
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:42,000
will be i would say there will be even

1455
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:43,680
unnecessary attention to this threat

1456
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:46,880
because the attackers will see okay this

1457
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:49,520
really hurt someone so we can do it

1458
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:51,280
perhaps again with another company it

1459
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:54,880
feels hard again so uh by making it such

1460
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:57,440
such big news uh and and putting too

1461
00:52:57,440 --> 00:52:59,440
much attention it will just attract um

1462
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:01,119
you know more attackers to do the same

1463
00:53:01,119 --> 00:53:02,640
thing so they will definitely seek off

1464
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:05,040
against that's my opinion

1465
00:53:05,040 --> 00:53:07,040
do you think there will be one yeah i

1466
00:53:07,040 --> 00:53:10,720
just a successful one as big and you you

1467
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:13,040
can go ahead and take that if you want

1468
00:53:13,040 --> 00:53:14,960
and tack it on to your your additional

1469
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:16,800
comments

1470
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:18,720
madonna

1471
00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:20,800
oh okay sure

1472
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:22,880
so um i'm just saying that we've started

1473
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:25,359
to um play fast and loose with the

1474
00:53:25,359 --> 00:53:27,680
environment and we have far more

1475
00:53:27,680 --> 00:53:30,000
connected systems or pieces than

1476
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,319
required so and uh when we talk about

1477
00:53:32,319 --> 00:53:34,000
these attacks the rewards are really

1478
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:37,280
really high and so compromising one such

1479
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:39,280
dependencies used by hundreds of

1480
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:41,119
products give you access to a lot of

1481
00:53:41,119 --> 00:53:43,599
places where they're used so hence i'm

1482
00:53:43,599 --> 00:53:45,760
sure we're going to see a lot more of

1483
00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:48,400
what we call as supply chain attacks

1484
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:50,559
i'm not sure if it's that big maybe even

1485
00:53:50,559 --> 00:53:52,400
more bigger or maybe

1486
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:55,760
a smaller but we will see coming up of

1487
00:53:55,760 --> 00:53:58,480
all these new attacks all these attacks

1488
00:53:58,480 --> 00:54:00,880
for sure

1489
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:02,640
excellent

1490
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:03,680
all right

1491
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:04,880
i think

1492
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:06,880
oh sure yeah i i think it's it's just

1493
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:08,400
one of those things where

1494
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:10,640
um looking at this type of attack i i

1495
00:54:10,640 --> 00:54:12,640
wish i could remember where the quote is

1496
00:54:12,640 --> 00:54:14,160
from and i can't even remember the exact

1497
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:16,000
quote but i'll paraphrase and say that

1498
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:17,839
it's i was like bank robber who was

1499
00:54:17,839 --> 00:54:18,720
saying

1500
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:21,119
essentially like why just go and steal

1501
00:54:21,119 --> 00:54:23,280
one person's wallet and take their money

1502
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:25,520
when you can go rob the bank and take

1503
00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:27,359
all of it right and so

1504
00:54:27,359 --> 00:54:29,680
that's what the supply chain tax are

1505
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:31,359
about is it's like okay well i can go

1506
00:54:31,359 --> 00:54:34,079
hit one company or i can go hit this

1507
00:54:34,079 --> 00:54:35,680
software vendor

1508
00:54:35,680 --> 00:54:38,720
you know get get my uh you know code in

1509
00:54:38,720 --> 00:54:40,480
there at compile

1510
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:41,920
and i get

1511
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:44,480
10 000 companies so that seems like a

1512
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:46,319
better use of time to me the return on

1513
00:54:46,319 --> 00:54:50,079
investment is pretty good there

1514
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:52,160
yeah absolutely all right we have about

1515
00:54:52,160 --> 00:54:54,720
two minutes left um i think we'll tie it

1516
00:54:54,720 --> 00:54:57,200
back to the beginning and say um

1517
00:54:57,200 --> 00:54:58,319
the

1518
00:54:58,319 --> 00:55:00,319
the pandemic has brought a lot of focus

1519
00:55:00,319 --> 00:55:02,799
on zero trust um

1520
00:55:02,799 --> 00:55:05,119
we have two minutes left so if you want

1521
00:55:05,119 --> 00:55:08,240
to take maybe 30 seconds and and

1522
00:55:08,240 --> 00:55:10,079
each and say what you think

1523
00:55:10,079 --> 00:55:12,319
is possible in zero trust today like

1524
00:55:12,319 --> 00:55:14,720
what what can you actually achieve um

1525
00:55:14,720 --> 00:55:16,799
with the tools that are available today

1526
00:55:16,799 --> 00:55:19,520
or or maybe what's missing

1527
00:55:19,520 --> 00:55:22,079
so lydia

1528
00:55:22,079 --> 00:55:24,240
i think for me um

1529
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:27,200
you know grifter mentioned it or

1530
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:29,680
maybe uh vitaly mentioned it before i

1531
00:55:29,680 --> 00:55:32,319
think when you know we all got sent home

1532
00:55:32,319 --> 00:55:35,040
and said we all need to work from home

1533
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:36,000
um

1534
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:37,040
at least

1535
00:55:37,040 --> 00:55:38,960
you're either going to quickly stand up

1536
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:40,799
massive infrastructure straight away so

1537
00:55:40,799 --> 00:55:42,640
people can work from home or you or your

1538
00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:43,920
or you you're going digital

1539
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:45,599
transformation but i think

1540
00:55:45,599 --> 00:55:47,119
for me i guess one of the key things

1541
00:55:47,119 --> 00:55:48,640
that we're still looking at is you know

1542
00:55:48,640 --> 00:55:50,559
the authentication and access controls

1543
00:55:50,559 --> 00:55:52,319
are just really really really important

1544
00:55:52,319 --> 00:55:53,680
going forward

1545
00:55:53,680 --> 00:55:55,920
um especially when companies are taking

1546
00:55:55,920 --> 00:55:57,760
that cloud first approach we've still

1547
00:55:57,760 --> 00:55:59,440
got to make sure that you know companies

1548
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:02,000
are enforcing the mfa and you know at

1549
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,000
least privileges you know people work

1550
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,160
remotely and they in they and they work

1551
00:56:06,160 --> 00:56:07,440
from home we're implementing those

1552
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:09,760
stronger authentication controls so

1553
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:11,440
that's my quick wrap-up

1554
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:13,760
okay uh 40 seconds left we'll let

1555
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:15,920
grifter give up give the final thoughts

1556
00:56:15,920 --> 00:56:16,960
on this one

1557
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:19,839
um sure i think um again you know zero

1558
00:56:19,839 --> 00:56:21,520
trust uh we've been talking about it for

1559
00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:23,200
years and what it really is talking

1560
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:25,359
about there is doing the separation and

1561
00:56:25,359 --> 00:56:27,040
the segmentation that we have been

1562
00:56:27,040 --> 00:56:28,640
talking about since the

1563
00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:30,559
you know at least me since the 1990s

1564
00:56:30,559 --> 00:56:32,400
right um we're talking about doing

1565
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:33,760
fundamentals here but we're talking

1566
00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:35,359
about doing them right

1567
00:56:35,359 --> 00:56:37,040
we mentioned when we're talking about

1568
00:56:37,040 --> 00:56:38,640
skills that maybe some of these

1569
00:56:38,640 --> 00:56:41,359
fundamentals are really boring but you

1570
00:56:41,359 --> 00:56:43,359
know give us a chance to put the fun

1571
00:56:43,359 --> 00:56:45,200
back in fundamentals and you know maybe

1572
00:56:45,200 --> 00:56:47,359
we'll get zero trust right i don't think

1573
00:56:47,359 --> 00:56:49,599
we're gonna end better than put the fun

1574
00:56:49,599 --> 00:56:51,440
back in the fundamentals

1575
00:56:51,440 --> 00:56:53,440
so uh with that i'd like to thank the

1576
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:55,760
four of you for being here and uh thank

1577
00:56:55,760 --> 00:56:57,920
the audience for sticking in with us

1578
00:56:57,920 --> 00:56:59,520
thanks for having us

1579
00:56:59,520 --> 00:57:02,759
thank you

1580
00:57:04,990 --> 00:57:09,089
