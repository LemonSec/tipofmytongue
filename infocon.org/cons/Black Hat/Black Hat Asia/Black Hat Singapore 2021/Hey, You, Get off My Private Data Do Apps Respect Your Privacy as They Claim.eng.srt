[Music]

2
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:20,160
hello everyone uh welcome to our talk

3
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,439
and in this talk we are gonna share you

4
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:26,240
with one of our recent work

5
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:28,960
on the application auditing

6
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:32,719
so we built a framework to identify the

7
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:34,800
private data collection

8
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,239
behaviors

9
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:38,320
from mobile applications

10
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:42,559
particularly android applications

11
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:46,079
so this is outline for today uh first of

12
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:48,640
all uh we are gonna give you a very

13
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:51,760
brief introduction about ourselves

14
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:54,399
and second is the background so in this

15
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:55,280
part

16
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:58,399
we are gonna give you a summary on the

17
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:01,440
data plot data protection regulations

18
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,039
around the world

19
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:05,519
and we will focus on

20
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:06,960
what kinds of

21
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:09,760
implications what those data protection

22
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:11,840
regulations

23
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:15,439
introduced to the device vendors and

24
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:18,400
application developers

25
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,320
the third part we are going to introduce

26
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:22,080
you our framework

27
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,000
we propose a few

28
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,200
menu and automatic techniques

29
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:30,000
to identify the data collection

30
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,600
behaviors from the mobile applications

31
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:36,880
and first based on our work we will give

32
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:39,840
a summary and also some recommendations

33
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,040
on the

34
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,159
uh private data protection on mobile

35
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:45,759
platforms

36
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:48,640
and so we are gonna have for uh the

37
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:51,600
fifth part will be like five minutes

38
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:52,840
qma

39
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:55,360
session so

40
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:58,479
first about ourselves

41
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:00,799
my name is baibandong and

42
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:02,719
i'm a senior lecturer from the

43
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:05,840
university of queensland australia and

44
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:08,479
my research is on mobile security

45
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:11,200
and the protocol analysis

46
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,400
and

47
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:15,520
my partner johnson he is now a senior

48
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,920
android security researcher from bike

49
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:18,959
dance

50
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:21,680
and his research direction is android

51
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:25,280
security and payment security

52
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:28,239
this is actually my third time to give

53
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:29,680
presentation

54
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,360
in black hat

55
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:34,640
i still remember my first talk is in

56
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:37,840
amsterdam in 2015

57
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:40,640
so i introduced my

58
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,239
work on the

59
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:44,959
application authentication

60
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:48,760
in black hat europe

61
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,400
later in 2017

62
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:55,120
uh both myself and jonathan gave another

63
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:58,879
talk on 3g and 4g scanning in blackhead

64
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:00,080
asia

65
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,959
and it's my it's our honors to give the

66
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:06,239
third talk today

67
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:10,239
second the back one

68
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:11,440
um

69
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:14,159
so nowadays the mobile devices already

70
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:15,920
become the

71
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:18,879
integral part of our daily life

72
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:20,400
we rely on

73
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:24,080
a massive number of applications to do

74
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,920
social engineering

75
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:28,640
online banking online shopping

76
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:31,360
and financial services and student so

77
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,720
force

78
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,959
it has been well known that those

79
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:36,640
applications may

80
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:39,200
collect our personal data

81
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,440
including the location

82
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:44,560
device id sim card information and

83
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:48,159
sometimes even purchase or browsing

84
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:49,599
history

85
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:51,840
they claim they're gonna use those data

86
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:52,640
for

87
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:55,840
purposes like analytics

88
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,799
application functionality enhancement

89
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:01,599
and product personalization

90
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:05,760
and also third party advertising

91
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,879
so this may risk concerns well for

92
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:12,319
example i demonstrate a recent study

93
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:15,840
this year here let's starting analyze

94
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,798
a few messenger applications

95
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:21,519
so they identify that some applications

96
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:24,560
may even request access to

97
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:28,880
tens of types of personal data even

98
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:32,160
sometimes purchase history and financial

99
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,759
information

100
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:34,479
so

101
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:37,199
this risks privacy concerns

102
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:40,160
first of all when we give access to

103
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,759
those application

104
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:43,520
we don't know how

105
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:46,160
close they are gonna use our data

106
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,320
and to whom they're gonna share our data

107
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,400
with

108
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:54,720
and second those applications may reuse

109
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:57,040
a few popular

110
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:01,440
sdk or libraries for analytics or

111
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,440
online advertising

112
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,280
this creates

113
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,919
opportunities for some malicious

114
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:11,039
entities to do cross application

115
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:12,320
tracking

116
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,680
and users

117
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,639
and also user profiling so they may get

118
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:18,320
our behaviors

119
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:21,440
in different applications so that is

120
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:26,639
easier for them to track the users

121
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:27,919
so

122
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:30,479
to protect the

123
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:33,520
data especially personal and private

124
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:34,720
data

125
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:37,199
many countries and regions

126
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:39,440
already put in place

127
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:43,759
some strict data protection regulations

128
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:45,919
for example in u.s

129
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:48,639
we we know the famous ccpa

130
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:52,960
and in europe european union we know the

131
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,560
most well-known

132
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:55,759
gdpr

133
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:58,000
and also in asia we have different

134
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,400
countries and regions already enact

135
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:05,199
the data protection regulations

136
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:07,280
so next

137
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:09,919
what we're going to talk about is

138
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:12,720
what kind of requirements

139
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:16,080
are introduced by those regulations

140
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,080
and more importantly

141
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:21,199
what kind of implications will be caused

142
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:23,120
onto our

143
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:26,400
developers and also device

144
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:29,840
device manufacturers

145
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:34,880
so i'm gonna use gdpr to us a case study

146
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,800
to show you this

147
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:40,160
so gdpr came into force on

148
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:44,160
may of 2018 in european union countries

149
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,880
and it was a major update to the

150
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:49,599
european union data protection

151
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:50,880
directive

152
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:54,599
introduced in 1995.

153
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:55,840
so

154
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:58,720
how you can understand gdpr basically i

155
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:01,280
i would recommend you to

156
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,919
get these six aspects

157
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:06,160
the first one is what

158
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,319
so

159
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:09,759
basically

160
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:12,800
the gdpr is applied to

161
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:16,000
those they call it data controllers who

162
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,840
are processing the personal data of

163
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:23,360
eu or uk residents

164
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:26,000
second one is which so what kind of data

165
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,440
is under the protection of gdpr so

166
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,919
basically any information

167
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:33,440
related to

168
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:36,720
europe to eu or uk citizens

169
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:39,840
whether they can be identified directly

170
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:42,160
or indirectly

171
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:45,680
the third aspect is why so why is gdpr

172
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:46,800
proposed

173
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,840
is to protect the personal data from

174
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,199
misuse

175
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:54,639
and to ensure data privacy

176
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:57,280
the first aspect how so later i will

177
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:00,160
give you more details in the next slide

178
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,479
but here you can just summarize it into

179
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:05,680
two aspects the first aspect

180
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,840
is gdpr

181
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,360
impose

182
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:12,319
more strict obligations to data

183
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:13,680
controllers

184
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,319
and second aspect is gdpr

185
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:19,280
tries to kind of give back

186
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:22,240
the rights the control to the data

187
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:25,680
owners to handle their own data

188
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:28,720
so next slide i'll give you more detail

189
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:29,680
and

190
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,120
the scope

191
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:34,159
gdpr will be applied to you know

192
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:35,519
globally

193
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:36,799
to any

194
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:39,440
organizations who process

195
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:42,640
the information of european or uk

196
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:43,919
residents

197
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:47,760
and the last aspect is a penalty so any

198
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:50,000
infringement or

199
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
major data breach

200
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,519
will result in

201
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:56,880
large penalty this can be up to

202
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,800
20 million euros

203
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,279
or even four percent

204
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:02,800
of the

205
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:07,199
you know the entity's global revenue

206
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:09,920
so let me zoom into the hall

207
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:12,320
basically gdpr has

208
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,320
six principles

209
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:17,600
so the first one um the personal data

210
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,360
should be processed

211
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:22,480
lawfully fairly and in a transparent

212
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:25,279
manner so basically for a

213
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:28,320
processing of the private data

214
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:31,120
those you know operations of processing

215
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:33,839
need to follow the law and also need to

216
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:36,560
be failed to the data owners

217
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:40,640
and also need to disclose

218
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:44,399
everything to the data owners

219
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:46,640
the second principle

220
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:50,320
personal data should be collect

221
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:53,839
for specified explicit and legitimate

222
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:54,880
purpose

223
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,959
so that means

224
00:09:56,959 --> 00:09:58,880
you know

225
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:01,680
the data controllers cannot arbitrarily

226
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,600
collect the data and they should declare

227
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,320
that purpose to the data owner then

228
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,320
follow that purpose they can collect the

229
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:12,000
data used for that specific specifically

230
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,079
for that purpose

231
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:17,360
and the set principle are the personal

232
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,120
information should be

233
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:22,000
adequate relevant and limited to what is

234
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,959
necessary so it's quite similar to the

235
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:27,920
list privilege principle

236
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:30,240
and first

237
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,959
the data should be accurate and whenever

238
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:36,320
it's necessary necessary keep up to date

239
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,760
and fifth

240
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:40,480
uh is about the period the data can be

241
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,720
retained by the

242
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:47,200
data controllers so this time should be

243
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,360
as short as possible

244
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,360
the last principle

245
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,800
is about

246
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:55,200
what kind of mechanism

247
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,200
should be taken to protect the

248
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:00,000
collective data so the principle

249
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,200
requests the data controllers to

250
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:07,120
apply appropriate protection mechanisms

251
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,480
on the

252
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:13,120
data that user data they collected

253
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,120
so

254
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:18,560
i just have a very quick uh summary of

255
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:21,440
not summary but introduction on what is

256
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:24,240
the difference between gdpr and other

257
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,680
regulations

258
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:28,800
so mostly the principles are

259
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,800
generally applicable

260
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:33,519
but there is some minor difference

261
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:35,839
especially on the scope

262
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:37,920
and application region

263
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:40,720
of those regulations so for example here

264
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:43,360
i list the scope and regen difference

265
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,600
between

266
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:47,519
usccpa and

267
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:50,639
european gdpr so you can find that they

268
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:52,399
have uniform

269
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:55,440
gdprs applicable to the

270
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:58,079
entities in europe and also to those

271
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:00,560
entities who process data

272
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,000
related to

273
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,959
europe citizens

274
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:08,399
and for ccpa is another way

275
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:11,360
is to apply applicable to the

276
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:15,279
california resident and also to those

277
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:18,639
entity organizations who do business in

278
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:21,440
california

279
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:25,120
so with those regulations those device

280
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:30,240
vendors or market managers also provide

281
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:33,040
strict requirements for

282
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,959
privacy policies

283
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:36,720
so

284
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:39,200
for example here i take the google play

285
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,639
as an example

286
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:41,839
uh you can

287
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:42,800
see

288
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,800
the highlight words

289
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,560
in in this slide

290
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:47,440
so

291
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,920
it requires a data controller basically

292
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:52,560
those applications to protect

293
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,000
the privacy

294
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,560
and give the legal use

295
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:59,519
to to the users

296
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:00,880
and also

297
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:03,200
they need to be transparent

298
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:06,959
to the users who they collect data from

299
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:09,839
and other things informations are also

300
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:12,240
listed in the requirements

301
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,639
so whoever wants to upload their

302
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:17,839
applications to google play must satisfy

303
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:19,600
those requirements

304
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,760
basically those requirements can be

305
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:24,320
summarized into four aspects

306
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:27,200
so the applications need to make

307
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:30,399
explicit make clear to the users what

308
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:32,800
kind of data they're gonna collect

309
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,800
and what is the purpose to collect the

310
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:37,600
data and if they are going to share the

311
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,279
data to whom

312
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:41,040
and also

313
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,079
need to

314
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:45,199
to be transparent to the users how

315
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:49,839
they are going to protect the user state

316
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:53,040
and it also has very

317
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:58,160
clear definition on the user data

318
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,399
so they need to

319
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:02,079
you know for those applications if they

320
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:04,399
want to handle user data they need to

321
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:05,839
disclose

322
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:07,920
the applications access

323
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:11,279
collection use and sharing of the data

324
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:13,519
and they need to limit the use of the

325
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:15,440
data

326
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:18,959
and if this user data happens to be

327
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:21,279
personal and sensitive information so i

328
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:22,160
would

329
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:24,959
introduce this thing in next slide they

330
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:28,000
need to give explicit

331
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,120
privacy policy

332
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,040
so you can find those personal and

333
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:35,760
sensitive information include

334
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:38,240
so-called personally identifiable

335
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:40,800
information so those information can

336
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:44,079
directly or indirectly linked to the

337
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:45,360
user

338
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,519
and then financial payment information

339
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:49,760
authentication information

340
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:52,399
from book contacts device locations and

341
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:53,839
so on and so forth

342
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:57,600
so if the applications

343
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:00,399
involves the use of such data they need

344
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:02,000
to fulfill those

345
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,079
six or sorry five

346
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:05,279
requirements

347
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:08,160
like to limit the access collection use

348
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:12,320
and sharing and to post explicit privacy

349
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:13,440
policy

350
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:17,199
and to handle the privacy data

351
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:18,959
in the cpu way

352
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:21,680
and so on so force

353
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:22,800
so

354
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,160
if you

355
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:26,880
go to google play you look at those

356
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:28,959
major applications

357
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:31,519
um you will find they have such privacy

358
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:34,160
policy so basically those policies they

359
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:35,600
usually cover

360
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:38,240
these six same statements

361
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:41,279
uh the first one is how the application

362
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:43,839
will collect the data is through api

363
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:46,079
through cameras with microphone or

364
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:47,440
support

365
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:49,519
and the second

366
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:52,320
what is the purpose

367
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,399
to collect the data

368
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:57,839
and third is a period the application

369
00:15:57,839 --> 00:15:59,680
will keep the data

370
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:02,880
and if they are gonna share the data to

371
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:05,360
whom and when they're gonna share

372
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,600
and also they will

373
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:10,399
make it clear what kind of control the

374
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:13,279
data owners have

375
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:15,360
and the last one is they you know

376
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:17,519
involve some children's data they need

377
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:23,440
to give a more clear policy on that

378
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,680
so

379
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:29,440
the next part is about the framework

380
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:30,720
basically

381
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:34,160
after study those regulations and

382
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,880
google's policies we try to propose a

383
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,480
framework

384
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:41,120
so that it can be used to automatically

385
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:44,240
or semi-automatically

386
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:46,560
do the application auditing on the

387
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,240
private data

388
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:51,120
processing

389
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,160
so

390
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:55,120
our motivation or our goal is you know

391
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:57,120
when when we're gonna conduct

392
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:59,680
application uh privacy compliance

393
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:02,800
auditing how can we ensure that

394
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:05,839
the testing or auditing covers

395
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:09,520
most if not all most privacy compliance

396
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:10,640
issues

397
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:15,439
because you know the privacy data can be

398
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:17,439
scattered like

399
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:20,640
distributed in the system so sometimes

400
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:23,039
you need to use apis to

401
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:24,079
access

402
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:28,000
and sometimes you may just need to use

403
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,039
some

404
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:32,320
sensors or camera or microphone to

405
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:35,360
collect those data so it's it's quite

406
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:39,200
tedious for the auditor to assess every

407
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:43,760
aspect during the auditing process

408
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:44,840
so our

409
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:50,080
motivations um we're trying to kind of

410
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,799
break down or kind of push from

411
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:55,039
regulations to practice

412
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:57,520
because you can find the regulations as

413
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:59,520
i just mentioned it's quite in a

414
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:00,960
principle level

415
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:03,919
now sometimes abstract ceramic or

416
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:05,120
complex

417
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:08,000
so we're gonna really you know push this

418
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,520
thing into prep into a practical tool

419
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:14,000
the second motivation is the from

420
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
passive to active

421
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,679
that means those

422
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:20,480
stakeholders like application developer

423
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:21,919
users

424
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:25,440
or manager of market application market

425
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:26,960
is kind of

426
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:30,000
current reaction is is why it's very

427
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,400
passive you know they identify or less

428
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,720
vulnerability there then they just do

429
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,320
some response

430
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:39,039
um but is it possible you know before

431
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:42,080
that that vulnerability

432
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:44,720
is identified by user exploited by

433
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,720
attacker

434
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,799
can we identify them

435
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:50,000
so

436
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,280
it's kind of from passive to active

437
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:55,360
the last part is from research to

438
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:57,200
application so

439
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,799
we have uh

440
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:01,600
that we have a large experience in this

441
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:04,000
area so we're thinking is it possible

442
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,520
for us to

443
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:08,400
put one in our brain into some

444
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,960
rare one application some hands-on

445
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:13,120
things and some tools

446
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:16,240
or guidelines that can be followed

447
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:19,840
in assessment or auditing

448
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:21,200
so

449
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:24,480
we follow such a thing we have a global

450
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:25,600
view

451
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:28,320
basically we take into consideration the

452
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:31,440
entire data life cycle and meanwhile we

453
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,360
are going to break down

454
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:35,840
into enforceable

455
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:39,840
checklist or to us

456
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:40,960
so

457
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:43,440
this you know result in two-level thing

458
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:46,559
or in our framework the logic level so

459
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:49,039
it's from the global view

460
00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:51,360
we're gonna give information to the

461
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:54,160
decision makers or managers you know to

462
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:56,559
let them have a big picture

463
00:19:56,559 --> 00:19:58,960
about the potential scenarios where

464
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:01,039
privacy issues may occur

465
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:03,280
and meanwhile we're going to give

466
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:05,039
enforceable

467
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:07,919
guidelines to the auditors and analysts

468
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:10,640
for them to make

469
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,880
inspections in an efficient and

470
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:15,360
comprehensive way

471
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:18,080
so in a logic level we consider the

472
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:20,960
entire data lifecycle including data

473
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,240
collection

474
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:25,919
data transmission storage and data use

475
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:28,799
so what we do is we

476
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:31,360
break down these four types into a few

477
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:32,400
items

478
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:35,919
and for each item we give description so

479
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:38,720
this is to you know let the

480
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,960
decision maker to understand what does

481
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:42,640
this item cover

482
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,640
and sometimes the

483
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:47,039
item need to be manually

484
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:50,000
check and if possible we will provide

485
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,080
some automation to us

486
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,919
so for example here

487
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:56,480
for the collection of user data we break

488
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:59,120
down it into four items

489
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:01,919
and the first item is to collect and use

490
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:03,679
data

491
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:06,320
you know within the scope of user

492
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:07,679
authorization

493
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:08,400
so

494
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,400
this it will check whether the

495
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,799
collection of user data by the

496
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:15,440
applications go beyond

497
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,799
the

498
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:20,720
data they claim that they list in a

499
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:23,600
privacy policy

500
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:26,320
so the same thing for other items and i

501
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:28,080
will leave it for your

502
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,039
reading

503
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:30,480
instead of

504
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:32,720
look through it one by one

505
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:33,919
so

506
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:37,200
we further break down them and make them

507
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,559
enforceable

508
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:40,640
into the enforcement level

509
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:42,320
so i identified

510
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:44,480
kind of exit points

511
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:46,480
where we can check those

512
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:47,840
um

513
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:50,080
valuations of the

514
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:53,039
you know use the private data collection

515
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:54,880
so for example

516
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:57,200
for the network request

517
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:00,000
we check whether application upload user

518
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,280
data

519
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:04,559
and what kind of data they will upload

520
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:05,360
and

521
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:07,840
when they upload do they

522
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:09,200
encrypt

523
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,480
the data

524
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:14,880
and also do they access and upload some

525
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:16,159
data which

526
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:18,720
shouldn't be which is out of the use out

527
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:22,559
of the purpose they claimed

528
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:25,039
and in uh

529
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:26,960
in our framework we also take into

530
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:30,000
consideration the policy difference

531
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,400
among countries so for example in some

532
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:33,919
countries

533
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:36,799
the regulations require

534
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:39,919
dynamic granting so whenever an

535
00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:41,520
application use

536
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:44,159
a permit a permission they need to get

537
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:45,360
users

538
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:46,559
um

539
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:49,679
granting and that runtime

540
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:52,080
and some is one-time granting is like

541
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,799
during application installation or

542
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:57,200
logging the user need to check the

543
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:00,400
policy and give the permission uh to the

544
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,679
user

545
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:04,000
so next i'm gonna

546
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:04,880
have

547
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:07,600
my partner johnson to give you more

548
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,679
introduction on our

549
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:12,159
framework so he will focus on the

550
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:15,360
enforcement level to give you the tools

551
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:17,520
and the techniques that

552
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:20,000
we use in our framework

553
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,520
and also he will give you a

554
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:23,919
demonstration

555
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:26,799
hello everyone i'm mutant

556
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:29,520
let me introduce you several automatic

557
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:32,080
tools in the framework made by us under

558
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:34,559
the test results

559
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:37,919
the first one is the domain tests tool

560
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:41,360
it can obtain all rbp addresses and the

561
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:43,039
domains from a

562
00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:46,640
application to check if they belong to

563
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:49,520
trustworthy entities

564
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:52,080
the second one is a privacy proper

565
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:53,840
window test tool

566
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:57,520
it can test if application obtains

567
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:00,799
user's privacy information before users

568
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:04,080
a user agrees to privacy policy using a

569
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:06,320
hook

570
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:09,679
the server is application second tool

571
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:13,120
it can check all the apis related to

572
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:15,039
privacy

573
00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:17,200
the last one is the traffic detection

574
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,960
tool

575
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:22,080
it can obtain all network traffic or the

576
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:25,039
application withdrawn

577
00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:28,080
we use these tools to check the part or

578
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:31,960
the privacy issues

579
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:35,760
uh here is some typical privacy

580
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:38,480
information in the android system we use

581
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:41,840
this tool to check

582
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:44,960
there are three types of permission in

583
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:46,480
android center

584
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:50,320
but we just focus on two of them

585
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:53,440
one is generous permission another is

586
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:55,440
normal permission

587
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:57,919
about the dangerous permission you need

588
00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:00,240
to request the long-term permission in

589
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:02,559
your application before you can access

590
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:05,279
the restricted data of performance

591
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:07,039
quickly the actions

592
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:09,440
such as location

593
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:11,679
about the number of permission

594
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:14,080
you just need to edit in the manifest

595
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:17,600
file you will get the data such as wifi

596
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:20,240
information

597
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:23,039
here we list the many common privacy

598
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:25,279
information assessments

599
00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:28,559
some of them will surprise you

600
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:32,240
the first one is android serial number

601
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:34,240
there are four ways to get it in

602
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:36,320
different and rewarding

603
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:39,279
such as we can use the static field

604
00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:40,640
serial

605
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:43,360
to catch it without any permission or

606
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:45,039
under it

607
00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:48,400
we can also use the function get serial

608
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:51,520
to get its rn rate

609
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:54,159
uh this function needs the reader for

610
00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:56,159
speed permission

611
00:25:56,159 --> 00:25:58,880
which is a dangerous permission

612
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:02,159
very surprising right

613
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:05,919
uh the second one is wifi information

614
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:09,200
such as we can read the address file

615
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:11,600
to get the mac address

616
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:15,520
we can also use the erp file to get the

617
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:18,720
root method address

618
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:23,520
this completely bypass the api

619
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:25,520
requirements

620
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:26,880
what's more

621
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:29,360
there are several information

622
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:31,760
people often refer to

623
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:34,159
such as the android id

624
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:36,640
application list

625
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:38,559
and a clipboard

626
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:40,159
unacceptably

627
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:41,760
this information don't need any

628
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:44,480
permission to be able to read them uh in

629
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:47,200
some unrewarding

630
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:49,520
uh here we just talk about the

631
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:52,720
information uh in other warning there

632
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:57,120
may be some changes with android update

633
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:05,600
we just see some api functions

634
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:08,720
let's talk about the field

635
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:09,919
we know

636
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:11,120
that there

637
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:13,039
are some hooking tools

638
00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:15,039
oh there are some google tools to

639
00:27:15,039 --> 00:27:18,000
monitor function calls

640
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,919
such as florida and exposed

641
00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:24,880
but we can't use these tools to hook a

642
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:26,320
field call

643
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:28,399
such as

644
00:27:28,399 --> 00:27:31,679
the other point serial

645
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:32,720
here

646
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:34,960
we

647
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:40,720
technology to achieve static field

648
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:43,279
mounting

649
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:46,960
let's see how we did it

650
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:48,960
the first step is

651
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:53,039
text to smiling then add the log and the

652
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:56,080
cell for signature hook modules to the

653
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:58,240
last text

654
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:01,360
the second step is add the log code to

655
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:05,600
those place after the field

656
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:08,159
then we add the signat

657
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:09,520
signature

658
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:12,640
code to the application class to make

659
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:15,120
sure we can replace the original

660
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:17,840
signature

661
00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:22,720
now we can build all the taxi

662
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:24,880
then

663
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:26,480
we use the new

664
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:31,840
taxes to replace the taxes in the apk

665
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:35,200
finally we can sign the apk using our

666
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:37,600
own signature

667
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:38,559
now

668
00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:41,919
when the application is running

669
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:44,960
the field uh when is the use

670
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:48,320
the logo will print

671
00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:54,559
here is the video temp here is a video

672
00:28:54,559 --> 00:28:58,480
demo to show how the automated to work

673
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:01,039
or monitoring the assets about

674
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:03,679
user privacy information before agreeing

675
00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:06,320
the privacy policy

676
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:07,520
we add

677
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:09,679
some getting the privacy information

678
00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:13,279
against when user reads the privacy

679
00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:15,600
policy file in the demo

680
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:20,159
then we use the tool to test it

681
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:23,120
we can see the call log under the call

682
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:25,360
exchange results

683
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:29,039
are recorded in the sd card files

684
00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:33,080
let's look at the demo

685
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:17,320
so

686
00:30:42,399 --> 00:30:45,399
so

687
00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:10,240
you can see the using log

688
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:14,919
are recorded in this file

689
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:21,440
also the static statics

690
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:25,720
are recorded in this file

691
00:31:54,559 --> 00:31:56,080
okay

692
00:31:56,080 --> 00:32:01,399
this is the demo let's see the next page

693
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:06,640
in this speech we have categorized the

694
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:08,000
functions

695
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:11,519
related to similar senses

696
00:32:11,519 --> 00:32:14,720
there are 13 types or privacy

697
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:17,039
information in this table

698
00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:21,360
for example we classified

699
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:25,679
that we classify bs study as study and

700
00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:28,559
make an address and so on as the website

701
00:32:28,559 --> 00:32:30,320
related

702
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:31,919
and the

703
00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:32,799
other

704
00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:35,360
also other privacy information

705
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:37,760
at least

706
00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:42,080
then we use the automated tool to test

707
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:46,480
about 1000 under 500 popular

708
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:49,360
applications from several application

709
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:51,360
stores

710
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:56,000
the test aspects are the access about

711
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:00,000
user privacy information in the table

712
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,159
the two pictures show the

713
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:07,600
statistical results about our tests

714
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:11,360
we did a total account about

715
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:15,039
100 1000 applications called some

716
00:33:15,039 --> 00:33:17,360
privacy related functions

717
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:19,039
you won't accept

718
00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:19,840
a

719
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:23,519
task and a system property

720
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:24,880
in which

721
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:27,760
there are also

722
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:32,799
579 applications using a normal ways to

723
00:33:32,799 --> 00:33:36,399
get the privacy information

724
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:40,080
the figure on the right shows how many

725
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:44,159
application calls were made for each of

726
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:49,720
the 13 types of privacy information

727
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,880
this page the leftover shows how many

728
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:57,519
applications using the different kinds

729
00:33:57,519 --> 00:34:00,159
of privacy information

730
00:34:00,159 --> 00:34:03,840
also the right one shows how many times

731
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:04,960
all the

732
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:07,919
two types of permissions related or

733
00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:12,399
privacy information functions called

734
00:34:12,399 --> 00:34:15,520
we found that the number or the function

735
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:18,159
call for privacy information about the

736
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:22,720
normal permission was quite high

737
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:25,199
okay

738
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:27,280
that's the test

739
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:28,480
that's all

740
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:30,719
uh let's quantum continue

741
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:32,639
thank you

742
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:36,239
thank you genting so now it comes to the

743
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:39,119
last part of today's presentation

744
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:43,359
and in summary we propose a framework

745
00:34:43,359 --> 00:34:45,199
um which

746
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:47,599
which can be used to audit

747
00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:49,359
android applications

748
00:34:49,359 --> 00:34:52,399
for the private information

749
00:34:52,399 --> 00:34:54,480
collection behaviors

750
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:55,440
and

751
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:58,960
our framework covers both logic view to

752
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:01,920
give the decision makers a big picture

753
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:04,480
about different scenarios

754
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:05,520
that

755
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,599
may involve privacy

756
00:35:07,599 --> 00:35:10,880
leakage and we also provide the analyst

757
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:12,800
and auditor

758
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:14,960
enforcement level

759
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:17,119
tools and techniques

760
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:19,119
for the

761
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:21,839
hands-on actually practical

762
00:35:21,839 --> 00:35:23,280
auditing

763
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:26,000
and we also based on this work we also

764
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,320
list several recommendations to the

765
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:30,640
mobile device users

766
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:31,760
basically

767
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:33,839
the users should

768
00:35:33,839 --> 00:35:37,280
pay attention to to expect the first one

769
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:38,800
is to try

770
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:40,800
upgrade

771
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:42,960
the operating system to the latest

772
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:45,839
version so here i use andrea's example

773
00:35:45,839 --> 00:35:48,079
you can find android use some new

774
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:50,000
mechanisms for the

775
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,839
privacy protection

776
00:35:51,839 --> 00:35:55,240
including restrictions on the user

777
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:57,200
unresettable

778
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:58,640
data items

779
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:01,200
and also some user

780
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:03,839
resettable identifiers

781
00:36:03,839 --> 00:36:05,280
like

782
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:07,599
the advertisement id

783
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:09,280
and also

784
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:12,560
it may enforce further permission to

785
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:15,520
access some particular data

786
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:17,119
for example in

787
00:36:17,119 --> 00:36:19,359
android 10 and android 11 if your

788
00:36:19,359 --> 00:36:22,240
application want to access the wi-fi or

789
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:24,079
network apis

790
00:36:24,079 --> 00:36:26,400
they need to get a fine

791
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:28,640
location permission

792
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:30,880
the other recommendation we want to give

793
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:32,480
to the user is

794
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:35,119
pay attention to those privacy

795
00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:36,320
policies

796
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:38,960
released by the applications to check

797
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:40,880
how the application will

798
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:43,359
collect use share

799
00:36:43,359 --> 00:36:45,440
the personal data

800
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:47,040
so that is all

801
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:50,560
about talk today and we are happy to

802
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:51,920
take questions

803
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:55,160
thank you
