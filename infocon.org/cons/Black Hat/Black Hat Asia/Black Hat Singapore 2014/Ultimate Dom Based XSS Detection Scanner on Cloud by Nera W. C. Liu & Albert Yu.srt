just lots of air

15
00:00:55,899 --> 00:00:59,309
poll where my life anyone out to look at
a computer every day I

16
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:05,479
lot of headaches being order palm but in
Jan ally with you lots live rhea

every break some staff we try to

18
00:01:10,130 --> 00:01:14,090
you and some stuff and we also develop
things so

19
00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:18,650
for today react we tried it peace and
our solution for Tom XSS

20
00:01:18,650 --> 00:01:23,030
so we're going to talk about why saddam
XSS the solution of that

21
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:28,580
how our solution works and you dad we
also going to show you guys at Babel

22
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:32,520
that looks to be cool Mr my real so

23
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:35,590
Weiss Tomic's SS your best

24
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:39,439
race in bold we can expand their badge
in one picture that

25
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:43,229
more like that I do something a secure
unit of billion

26
00:01:43,229 --> 00:01:47,360
in reality this is action or something

27
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:51,640
meal is you lost first top discussing
year 2005

28
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:54,950
that on one of the

29
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:58,020
pioneer she summit other call to the

30
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:01,610
W W free community talking about

31
00:02:01,610 --> 00:02:05,079
day some way but you can exporters

32
00:02:05,079 --> 00:02:08,200
XSS Paul Bamba fall having the Paleo

33
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:11,680
going into surplus over style or check
that means

34
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:17,290
if you look bad example here the Paleo
yes I'll be is just ponder

35
00:02:17,290 --> 00:02:22,489
you extract from the URL and and a kind
side rubbing strips hi to

36
00:02:22,489 --> 00:02:25,739
analyze try to post masturbate I am

37
00:02:25,739 --> 00:02:30,269
million executing the browser so in that
case you have some malicious

38
00:02:30,269 --> 00:02:35,390
paleo on to you or allow than that
hacker can steal y'all

39
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:41,420
your they'd hide inside the bomb richest
that object inside a browser that's tall

40
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:42,780
order credentials

41
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:47,360
soup if this is not up new Paul bomb

42
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:52,190
why we are so you can show us on that
the the fact is that bomb XSS

43
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:55,640
has some very interesting poverty is so
you feel about

44
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:59,300
how you works you can see that the Paley
South

45
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:03,420
can ship by pasta surface I deep action
that means you've

46
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:06,620
I put up a long are you all hash or UPS

47
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:10,110
the pale with getting force up by some
user interaction

48
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:13,420
he doesn't go to decipher by so you if
you try to

49
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:16,450
try to look at the SS law or you try to
install some

50
00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:19,989
Application Firewall you will never be
able to detect omics SS

51
00:03:19,989 --> 00:03:23,790
right and also there's some other
pioneer like Google

52
00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:27,400
Facebook people post some service I
framework to defeat excess that's like

53
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,790
Google kosher or

54
00:03:28,790 --> 00:03:32,260
Facebook keep all right but you look at
that

55
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:35,569
they can only PU and excess ass from
happening on the server side

56
00:03:35,569 --> 00:03:38,819
you'd never be able to look at this
kansai larger

57
00:03:38,819 --> 00:03:42,010
right so the this actor Corey a lot of
opportunities

58
00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:45,750
for but with the hunter right because if
I want to get the

59
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:48,980
get the reward and I want to buy
possible action

60
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:53,470
I just want to look at the things that
you can up attack so that become a more

61
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:54,480
and more you just think

62
00:03:54,480 --> 00:04:00,230
problem for the security folks in the
industry so what will use the radar

63
00:04:00,230 --> 00:04:05,599
recant Deepak comics SS most people look
at staffing an artist and I'll

64
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:08,959
also try to a explain why static and are
just doesn't work

65
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:13,830
in that sense so maybe I could use our
very simple example how's that and

66
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:14,640
assets work

67
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:18,019
%um in reality you five try to top

68
00:04:18,019 --> 00:04:22,240
thing from the way that but all their
powers are you sleeping creator

69
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:25,479
thank you if you need to do that an
artist it's just like

70
00:04:25,479 --> 00:04:28,759
you're trying to cut it opine know how
things work

71
00:04:28,759 --> 00:04:33,110
inside seeing order by dress older Musso
s Caton

72
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:38,009
but because you actually cut the open
dusan have added I make

73
00:04:38,009 --> 00:04:41,610
R-twelve folder that means you need to
be measured by yourself how

74
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:44,820
everything spec together

75
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:49,449
so you reality in the webcam all mine
when Tomic that has happened to happen

76
00:04:49,449 --> 00:04:50,389
in the JavaScript

77
00:04:50,389 --> 00:04:54,280
space right drops the join us your
contacts so here you can see all the

78
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:55,360
Dallas trip

79
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:59,830
enough you know real emo Monday lap and
sighs ya holder why can't I school go

80
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:04,080
sorry special wherever compaq's if you
need to analyze that

81
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:07,250
and even more than that them more static

82
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:10,750
component that can begin Jack into a
voucher-like

83
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:14,380
like you have to you can measure Hawks
%uh manana must function on Jolla strip

84
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:17,000
that I should get more JavaScript in
place

85
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,080
and also you there are some strips of
pac bad you can

86
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:25,590
inject some for party Java chip death so
sorry use very difficult to Colac

87
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:28,919
order JavaScript

88
00:05:28,919 --> 00:05:32,039
and what's more is that they are also
buy lamictal or check to

89
00:05:32,039 --> 00:05:35,919
at Javas trip like you can issue creates
trip

90
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:40,479
you cya strip like you here you can see
i'd I can't do a document doc reality

91
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:40,960
Mon

92
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:44,449
that actually DJ Moore strip and
sometimes you

93
00:05:44,449 --> 00:05:48,300
you cannot also kept you can also catch
some dues action when I can collect

94
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:55,300
yessir execute some other job it's true

95
00:05:56,199 --> 00:05:59,840
so you some are you force that and I was
like this

96
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:03,289
generator hot because you need to get
order snapshot

97
00:06:03,289 --> 00:06:06,550
and also there are some dynamic closure
inside right

98
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:10,590
n further if you look your thing about
Java strip along

99
00:06:10,590 --> 00:06:15,370
that may be a that maybe you see about
they also HTML

100
00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:19,009
ship da bus trips the SS income by
national of them

101
00:06:19,009 --> 00:06:23,110
if you need to do us that a narcissist
just like you need to do an office on C

102
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:24,850
program together with Java

103
00:06:24,850 --> 00:06:29,740
by so yes at your heart problem so today
we're going to talk about all solution

104
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:30,270
do not

105
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:33,520
rocks that works in a different way so
I'll pass on to my colleagues

106
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:37,110
you want to talk about it are thank you
our bed

107
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:40,550
arm soul ahron that is going to

108
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:44,600
did next session is going to discuss
about how we solve the problem

109
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:49,560
arm I guess everybody right now here
understand static analysis is kinda hard

110
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:54,500
it if your programmer it is just Colby
will you need two wheeler at fifty

111
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:58,900
and into understand what is actually
inside and a house to work for all

112
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:03,610
so our approach here today is and other
way is in all the time

113
00:07:03,610 --> 00:07:08,250
is another direction we call the dynamic
approach of detained N R's

114
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:12,440
arm in order to make you more
understanding I used to see matter for

115
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:12,870
dat

116
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:16,349
the web application is just a living
creatures we wont

117
00:07:16,349 --> 00:07:20,840
understand the Brock how'd abrupt fall
within the your body

118
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:24,780
from wish all goes to an all the one and
then all those stuff

119
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:28,110
and in the idea is we will try to you in
Jack

120
00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:31,160
some tracking agent into your Barack

121
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:35,370
and then to observe how'd howdy age in
parting from your bar

122
00:07:35,370 --> 00:07:39,550
well within your brought body so this is
too ideas

123
00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:42,979
and then in terms of the programming
what the brown is

124
00:07:42,979 --> 00:07:45,979
is actually the street big is

125
00:07:45,979 --> 00:07:49,639
you know when you are out building web
application although this program is

126
00:07:49,639 --> 00:07:51,310
actually talking about

127
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:54,319
the character the string and then

128
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:58,190
our idea is to at de traite de tracking

129
00:07:58,190 --> 00:08:02,259
agent on this train we called it the
taking the frat

130
00:08:02,259 --> 00:08:06,840
and then during the execution of a drive
a script will propagate dat

131
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:11,120
tracking agen during order ever met the
operation up a string

132
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:15,539
like a Simon like con cab although stop

133
00:08:15,539 --> 00:08:22,539
this is too ideas

134
00:08:22,629 --> 00:08:25,729
in order to achieve this are we have

135
00:08:25,729 --> 00:08:29,660
done we have did something firstly we
need to pick up

136
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:33,089
some arm browser like

137
00:08:33,089 --> 00:08:36,779
pro little browser like to use one after
Canon days

138
00:08:36,779 --> 00:08:41,690
fit are in need to surf and MJs I'm not
quite sure whether everybody know it

139
00:08:41,690 --> 00:08:44,700
the Pan Am J as is is a hapless browser

140
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:48,850
are it is actually run on top of the
JavaScript clio engine and the WebKit

141
00:08:48,850 --> 00:08:49,760
engine

142
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:53,089
and and a hot headless man stat it you
can run

143
00:08:53,089 --> 00:08:57,620
are on to come on I and then it just
just just a mess real browser

144
00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:02,420
but without a gooey with no DUI so that
is the first thing we

145
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:06,100
why why we pick up the van MJs do it to
do it

146
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:10,630
and and and other things we do is we
hacked to drive a spate call engine back

147
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:12,000
adding that the King

148
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:17,110
signal into it during to JavaScript call
engine executed JavaScript

149
00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:21,000
will propagate at tracking agen week
auditing the frat

150
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:26,160
through order ever mattered operations
and into 13 we are doing we will all

151
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:30,930
into did Daum for doll me everybody is
the Document Object Model

152
00:09:30,930 --> 00:09:35,450
there is a input we call the sauce and
there is a output we call the sink

153
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:39,680
for the salsa everybody know maybe
they're one typical example is so you

154
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:40,600
are al

155
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:44,890
is actually you can put everything into
take you out an impetus of output

156
00:09:44,890 --> 00:09:45,920
distinct

157
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:49,880
actually armed a typical example is a
document doc right when you can write

158
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:51,750
something back to the DOM

159
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:54,820
so here's some example what we have to
hack

160
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:58,620
in today JavaScript call engine are on
top

161
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:02,260
you can see of rely on this very simple
javascript

162
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:05,510
the first light is worried something
from the sauce

163
00:10:05,510 --> 00:10:08,980
and and a sack in is we do some our
string operation

164
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:12,060
and then finally it to sink so in the
first light

165
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:15,110
we have something when you the browser
call

166
00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:18,350
to Saul's we will at that I think no
into it

167
00:10:18,350 --> 00:10:21,820
and aside unitnumber we call will call
it are

168
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:25,130
tenders think no and end at identify
where we will we got

169
00:10:25,130 --> 00:10:28,860
as a pro 1.2 execution for a of district

170
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:35,019
and as sakin we view arm is a is a is
just a very simple substring operation

171
00:10:35,019 --> 00:10:39,140
when you would call this substring
function we would eat at whether that

172
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:40,029
thing the signal

173
00:10:40,029 --> 00:10:43,320
with industry at a bully within does the
strain

174
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:46,410
if it is yes and they will return back

175
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:50,589
if it is not we just live it and I'll
and then finally

176
00:10:50,589 --> 00:10:54,570
we will the TAC where did estate no

177
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:57,870
is happen is actually happen at the

178
00:10:57,870 --> 00:11:00,970
sink of the DOM and endeavored to stick
a piece

179
00:11:00,970 --> 00:11:04,880
we will fetch you that's something
passed through

180
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:08,680
if it's not just live it along and then
we will

181
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:12,709
try to scan order web application
through this kind of a magnetism

182
00:11:12,709 --> 00:11:17,140
and then report back that where they
lived on his team are not

183
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:20,300
bad it doesn't mean arm

184
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:24,670
is where biggest their biggest when you
imagine

185
00:11:24,670 --> 00:11:30,290
data stat wet the web application right
now no matter how complicated is

186
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:34,720
we r emulate the same behavior of the
execution of a drive square when you

187
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:35,510
lower it

188
00:11:35,510 --> 00:11:39,810
so no matter how complicated is weekends
do an oz

189
00:11:39,810 --> 00:11:43,589
so our scanner dare stumps out to
finding

190
00:11:43,589 --> 00:11:46,620
in our scanner are I used the same

191
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:50,510
dropper swept you can see the first its
the free lie of a javascript

192
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:53,990
and and when you're seeing there's you
can see when we was that

193
00:11:53,990 --> 00:11:58,040
that pieces of the drums for posting by
server we fight to finding

194
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:01,920
one fighting is you can see the sauce
with assigned to preach unitnumber

195
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:02,889
over-the-air

196
00:12:02,889 --> 00:12:06,149
we identified they're free execution for
all for father

197
00:12:06,149 --> 00:12:11,120
for the drops with and an you can see it
with if you look into the number to you

198
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:14,620
actually you can see the number two has
execute a substring

199
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:19,570
operation and then finally weekend it
had testing testing know at the open up

200
00:12:19,570 --> 00:12:20,389
the dome

201
00:12:20,389 --> 00:12:24,540
which is what we are expected and then
the second thing is

202
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:27,600
we identified a browser actually has a
hidden bro

203
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:31,760
when you look into the code you can
never find it we never know

204
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:36,610
that execution fullbright our dynamic
approach can identified a self

205
00:12:36,610 --> 00:12:41,560
won the turf role is location hearth is
being called it and then being executed

206
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:42,700
by some water

207
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:47,070
some of the string operation but okay it
never happened at the same but

208
00:12:47,070 --> 00:12:51,260
we identify hidden for within it so this
is the to finding

209
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:55,269
bar our our dynamic scanner

210
00:12:55,269 --> 00:12:59,209
so arm in order to make are its use

211
00:12:59,209 --> 00:13:02,490
more usable I what I'm ain't what I 1i
maginnis

212
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:06,260
we identified the documents Ching but it
doesn't mean is this Tommy excessive 10

213
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:07,120
book

214
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:11,170
but that's it no allow us to

215
00:13:11,170 --> 00:13:14,700
fussed input beakers with new we know
something passed through

216
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:18,279
and a week in Jax some wonderful patent
into the input

217
00:13:18,279 --> 00:13:23,579
and then try to decode so because rear
I'll defend MGS Gators are on alert

218
00:13:23,579 --> 00:13:26,980
handler if there is a something pop up
we will

219
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:31,940
we are sure that is saddam excess water
bowl so we will try to first input

220
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:35,889
and Andy are some well-known Paden if
you are if you're a hacker to have two

221
00:13:35,889 --> 00:13:36,930
da mix SS

222
00:13:36,930 --> 00:13:40,160
so you will know what happened to inject
into facet

223
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:43,240
and then Eve come biting detained a
stick know and

224
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:46,970
on alert signal if both of the condition
a true

225
00:13:46,970 --> 00:13:51,480
and then we catch it at your apt web
application is da mix ss1 herbal

226
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:56,130
so our goal why we are doing this
because we want you achieve desyrel

227
00:13:56,130 --> 00:13:59,260
force alarm offers can I mean stat

228
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:02,870
weekend actually captured at your web
application a small oval

229
00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:06,459
when be scanned it this is very
important because you have to have a

230
00:14:06,459 --> 00:14:08,959
false alarm and then you choose is not
usable

231
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:11,959
so that is our go to make our scanner

232
00:14:11,959 --> 00:14:17,490
adjustable security to use so and other
things that we we have done is are we

233
00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:19,310
trying to bash my the penalty hit by

234
00:14:19,310 --> 00:14:22,639
adding that the king did provocations
are lodging within

235
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:26,940
for the member euch wie firing to
perform and hit this new gadget lebow

236
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:31,680
the average member use dejar we wondered
a ten times to steam you our house seem

237
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,440
applications same logic

238
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:36,959
we find a member you say shit actually
this are I mean the difference for in

239
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:38,160
the kitchen table

240
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:42,000
it is also there at the same conclusion
can come from the network latency

241
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:42,740
biggest

242
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:46,279
actually Durant riptide Dominator all
deterred Obama's NN

243
00:14:46,279 --> 00:14:49,740
our larger within the JavaScript call
and Anderson

244
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:52,889
this unhurt too much

245
00:14:52,889 --> 00:14:57,050
so arm lemme do a quick damn old to

246
00:14:57,050 --> 00:15:00,639
too tired to use on

247
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:04,339
are firstly I'll I we have

248
00:15:04,339 --> 00:15:09,060
actually find some of our reach Rep are
I mean the web application on the web

249
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:10,170
and then we find out

250
00:15:10,170 --> 00:15:14,260
the air right now how dare the ass up
Manny drivers for framework

251
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:18,579
and then which is very popular to make
shoot too happy to make some very

252
00:15:18,579 --> 00:15:22,149
who are web applications so that's why
we find

253
00:15:22,149 --> 00:15:25,709
this one this website yeah around sixty
different type

254
00:15:25,709 --> 00:15:29,639
author framework and then we can squeeze
can or does

255
00:15:29,639 --> 00:15:33,529
and then we find for damn are actually
da mix as a swallow bull

256
00:15:33,529 --> 00:15:37,040
and then one of dampness is one arm

257
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:41,139
this is a very tough symbology to
application and then you can't import

258
00:15:41,139 --> 00:15:45,209
on import

259
00:15:45,209 --> 00:15:48,449
that ass and then you can see there are
to do Africa

260
00:15:48,449 --> 00:15:51,889
to do that to boost this and then we try
to

261
00:15:51,889 --> 00:15:56,889
import some of a wild known

262
00:15:56,889 --> 00:16:00,860
at how tractor and then you can see I
can trigger

263
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:04,699
a secure doctor JavaScript and in
ditches somewhat it is saddam excesses

264
00:16:04,699 --> 00:16:06,540
wanna buy application

265
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:13,540
in our scanner arm

266
00:16:18,830 --> 00:16:21,179
okie its

267
00:16:21,179 --> 00:16:24,720
in our scanner we also tried to run the
same you out

268
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:28,670
and and this is the same you are out of
date at a web app

269
00:16:28,670 --> 00:16:33,559
web application and an way will scan
through it and then you can see

270
00:16:33,559 --> 00:16:39,019
we can trigger the on alert signal and
%uh also identified a lot over defend

271
00:16:39,019 --> 00:16:43,899
user I am in dirt JavaScript execution
from you can see there's a lot

272
00:16:43,899 --> 00:16:47,910
even though you just simply import the
tax into the tax bar

273
00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:51,410
and then actually dear around 50
something

274
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:55,239
execution within you never know it when
you're doing that

275
00:16:55,239 --> 00:16:59,319
that static and all its but we identify
it and then

276
00:16:59,319 --> 00:17:02,989
for ticket for one of the input week at
the state no corder

277
00:17:02,989 --> 00:17:07,870
are to in order to make in more easy to
identify with at a signal call the 909

278
00:17:07,870 --> 00:17:13,029
which is to input user interaction we r
input just like I do with the same

279
00:17:13,029 --> 00:17:17,819
in the web application and then we can
identify Datsik no

280
00:17:17,819 --> 00:17:21,699
a being public a is somewhere

281
00:17:21,699 --> 00:17:25,209
are we and ice call it on on No

282
00:17:25,209 --> 00:17:28,230
no publication is actually directly to
the sink

283
00:17:28,230 --> 00:17:32,399
so by combining this

284
00:17:32,399 --> 00:17:35,730
do you say no weekend how true dat

285
00:17:35,730 --> 00:17:39,860
your application is wonderful da mix SS
walkable

286
00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:44,419
so and then on top of it and mgs because
the a lot of different jobs

287
00:17:44,419 --> 00:17:47,840
user interaction as a cue engineered you
can call

288
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:51,429
order call or cook order into Russian

289
00:17:51,429 --> 00:17:55,440
in Judah independent yes our scanner and
then you can't eat at

290
00:17:55,440 --> 00:18:00,350
so is is kind of a press a bull so

291
00:18:00,350 --> 00:18:05,179
arm let me give you a quick summary of
all work arm

292
00:18:05,179 --> 00:18:09,820
presley arm we are going to open source
our scanner so we are the 1

293
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:13,220
the first one to have odometers a
scanner in the marketplace

294
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:16,490
and then we biggest are

295
00:18:16,490 --> 00:18:19,690
approaches this kind of a dynamic
approach so

296
00:18:19,690 --> 00:18:22,990
are we we second went to study and
analysis problem

297
00:18:22,990 --> 00:18:26,789
for atomic SSD cache in and in our
solution right now

298
00:18:26,789 --> 00:18:31,889
are is robust because we didn't buy any
are great performing hits on the member

299
00:18:31,889 --> 00:18:34,690
you say schnabel agency so it is bro
butts

300
00:18:34,690 --> 00:18:38,269
and an we actually based on the WebKit

301
00:18:38,269 --> 00:18:41,330
it's not immolation it is the same

302
00:18:41,330 --> 00:18:44,399
estate use the into ration loop on the

303
00:18:44,399 --> 00:18:48,730
just without a good week and then which
is it is a Carmelite

304
00:18:48,730 --> 00:18:53,279
arm choose so that's why you can't
easily integrated with order automation

305
00:18:53,279 --> 00:18:53,760
pass

306
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:57,260
and and the finally because we will on
or ally

307
00:18:57,260 --> 00:19:00,789
are we read rely on the on the lead
handle being called a

308
00:19:00,789 --> 00:19:05,909
so our scanner can reap alt us have
achieve to see reform Salaam

309
00:19:05,909 --> 00:19:09,519
arm are alarm of RT cash in

310
00:19:09,519 --> 00:19:13,169
so it is usable 44 da mix SSD cache

311
00:19:13,169 --> 00:19:16,210
some yeah and then

312
00:19:16,210 --> 00:19:21,139
if you want to know for their biggest is
a kind of a fresh pack you wait have two

313
00:19:21,139 --> 00:19:22,899
jobs because I O to cope is

314
00:19:22,899 --> 00:19:26,970
are greedy and then if anybody like to
repatriate I'm

315
00:19:26,970 --> 00:19:30,600
we are welcome because we just want to
prove our concept is more

316
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:35,039
are is more good battered and a steady
and others urs

317
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:38,429
and so that's why you can't find more
information in the cake hop

318
00:19:38,429 --> 00:19:42,010
and then stay tuned armed they are some
creative

319
00:19:42,010 --> 00:19:45,210
being used under license and then we
would like to arm

320
00:19:45,210 --> 00:19:48,539
bang some folk within ya who also
libation

321
00:19:48,539 --> 00:19:51,690
imagery purse on the way in and
Christopher and of course

322
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:54,529
Yahoo to give us the opportunity to
present here because they have

323
00:19:54,529 --> 00:19:55,799
contribute some after

324
00:19:55,799 --> 00:19:59,909
ideas and work with our portrait Yap

325
00:19:59,909 --> 00:20:03,309
sell yet that's it role for my work
today

326
00:20:03,309 --> 00:20:07,970
are and yes so we actually have to
battle

327
00:20:07,970 --> 00:20:11,679
on their YouTube channel so you can go
to youtube and

328
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:16,169
every loss actually try very hard to
connect to internet but

329
00:20:16,169 --> 00:20:20,399
we cannot contact us so that that them
without if you want to see that again

330
00:20:20,399 --> 00:20:21,559
you can go to

331
00:20:21,559 --> 00:20:24,600
you too and thanks very much for coming
and

332
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:29,269
any questions so far your

333
00:20:29,269 --> 00:20:32,799
so so re clam that we are the first on
doing

334
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:36,460
thing to an our service on doing organs
of thing I think I N R's

335
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:41,000
by so dominated works you know worried
very cool way so fast what a question

336
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,960
so Dominator how it works is they
actually try to modify Firefox

337
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:48,210
and that they try to solve the problem
on collecting Audit Office

338
00:20:48,210 --> 00:20:51,899
JavaScript as I mention right and then
from there they they wanted to us that

339
00:20:51,899 --> 00:20:52,860
an artist

340
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:57,049
and see how things work from there so

341
00:20:57,049 --> 00:21:00,970
yeah I was at that some difference but
IIIT to publish about

342
00:21:00,970 --> 00:21:04,679
I would believe they are more to us
doing that I N R's

343
00:21:04,679 --> 00:21:07,960
but I i see that they try to chiding try
to do with

344
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:11,830
arm I forgave by monkey or use it as
pine

345
00:21:11,830 --> 00:21:15,470
something like that they tried to do to
an office on the JavaScript they

346
00:21:15,470 --> 00:21:18,100
contacted and then

347
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:21,289
and then up with the farming on the
console

348
00:21:21,289 --> 00:21:24,470
right so yellow I feel we should

349
00:21:24,470 --> 00:21:31,470
measure them

350
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:37,210
yeah reactor I should I should purchase
one of that

351
00:21:37,210 --> 00:21:42,170
I should purchase one purchase one of
the yeah

352
00:21:42,170 --> 00:21:46,310
its if this morning we also have some
complication with with him on

353
00:21:46,310 --> 00:21:50,350
decide pick the movie just saying it
will be adjusting well

354
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:53,410
popping out into public how Hall how he

355
00:21:53,410 --> 00:21:58,150
is working on a thing that the pop at my
early understanding last time I checked

356
00:21:58,150 --> 00:21:58,730
it doing

357
00:21:58,730 --> 00:22:05,550
that an office but you may be right
there they may be doing some other okay

358
00:22:05,550 --> 00:22:08,810
for a vote for the Seawolves false alarm
arm

359
00:22:08,810 --> 00:22:12,180
I mean that approach we actually we need
to know

360
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:16,230
some non packed in fall for the
injection so

361
00:22:16,230 --> 00:22:19,710
if because we just want but is how we do
that because

362
00:22:19,710 --> 00:22:23,360
first being we did had that document is
Tom did and then

363
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:26,920
if it is our teen tits are attained it
and I'm we will

364
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:30,710
do the first input operation to improve
our scan the efficiency

365
00:22:30,710 --> 00:22:35,710
and then on when we had busty input we
need to have some Paden

366
00:22:35,710 --> 00:22:40,330
and then some of the pattern is very
well known 224 to da mix SSO would try

367
00:22:40,330 --> 00:22:40,730
dis

368
00:22:40,730 --> 00:22:44,400
different out input if weekend triggered

369
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:47,960
on alert and we will be part it is a
zero false it is

370
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:51,170
is confirmed it are while a bowl are
attack

371
00:22:51,170 --> 00:22:55,730
so in this pile of there's a child's
will miss some padding

372
00:22:55,730 --> 00:22:59,090
of cause because if there's somebody
know all

373
00:22:59,090 --> 00:23:02,300
that pattern can in Jack and then and
then our scanner

374
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:07,140
may not scanned at Patton that if we
identified a pad in we book

375
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:11,530
cunt continues to at back to our
database to dad to have that passion for

376
00:23:11,530 --> 00:23:12,550
scanning next time

377
00:23:12,550 --> 00:23:17,010
so this is the way we we we want to make
are choose 22

378
00:23:17,010 --> 00:23:20,090
more usable because are we at the Falls

379
00:23:20,090 --> 00:23:23,530
there's a trace trays of is our
forefathers 0 false alarm is

380
00:23:23,530 --> 00:23:26,810
we cannot make sure cover order patton
but

381
00:23:26,810 --> 00:23:30,120
we contra bill from time to time because
we know some

382
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:33,670
new pad in and away added into it an end
to it at continues to

383
00:23:33,670 --> 00:23:40,500
Qatar contributor back to our database
of it yeah

384
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:43,510
arm out re tui upon bad there's
something

385
00:23:43,510 --> 00:23:48,030
out right now in our my is suffering
sample you write that rap application

386
00:23:48,030 --> 00:23:52,200
you need to do that to a test okay it is
a must okay

387
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:55,750
are how how do a duet maybe descriptor
you say interaction

388
00:23:55,750 --> 00:24:00,240
and an if you write on the Phantom JS to
do to

389
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:05,510
that kinda automation tasks and I'm we
will empower you to repot bat that

390
00:24:05,510 --> 00:24:08,150
whether your application is Tommy says
this one up on our

391
00:24:08,150 --> 00:24:12,580
that is one thing because we we just
just at the fuel line 26 to check the

392
00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:13,560
condition where did it

393
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:17,560
document a stain on not and then the
second thing is our

394
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:21,460
use it you are talking about and others
wat challenge is

395
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:25,880
the a lot over defend user interaction
you need to understand the contacts for

396
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:26,700
example you know

397
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:30,610
need to know the cake that by 10 and
then to do that innu

398
00:24:30,610 --> 00:24:33,650
complete the pro but our thinking is

399
00:24:33,650 --> 00:24:37,000
in the queue a automation has or to a
task you already copper

400
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:40,810
so I doesn't care about their part
because you cover it and then just

401
00:24:40,810 --> 00:24:41,630
enable it to

402
00:24:41,630 --> 00:24:45,650
to to tell whether the sting or not said
that is our our ideas and ended the

403
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:46,170
ration

404
00:24:46,170 --> 00:24:49,430
to to trip to tackle that problem but if
you out

405
00:24:49,430 --> 00:24:54,560
talking about more and other challenges
to understanding to what the contacts of

406
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:55,690
the web application

407
00:24:55,690 --> 00:24:58,980
oh we r try to explore it maybe

408
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:02,070
sums guy say it is a ATI or whatever but

409
00:25:02,070 --> 00:25:05,740
yet is an open question on that part if
we can solve it

410
00:25:05,740 --> 00:25:08,910
it's a scarab is terrible because
weekend scan

411
00:25:08,910 --> 00:25:13,470
order stop on the internet so just
adding on the I think one of the

412
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:15,370
challenge of doing static nasa's

413
00:25:15,370 --> 00:25:18,940
so so the for the fact I've tried you
rather a lot of

414
00:25:18,940 --> 00:25:23,130
commercial and I'll analyzer they scam
that they can't do that

415
00:25:23,130 --> 00:25:26,950
right but the fact is what they'd which
try to take as I

416
00:25:26,950 --> 00:25:30,690
important they were ask you to Beloit
JavaScript in South the

417
00:25:30,690 --> 00:25:33,830
HTML so from there that

418
00:25:33,830 --> 00:25:38,010
basil idea usual imitation because all
the ripe age they appeal form HTML

419
00:25:38,010 --> 00:25:41,300
not to mention that they cannot handle
UN handle a

420
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:47,160
those things right so far from I was say
General tab harder limitation on

421
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:51,400
doing stat and others as compared with
dynamic alabama won

422
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:56,930
and I'm from dad read to buy to look at
how we should do dynamic than ours are

423
00:25:56,930 --> 00:25:58,480
seen a more you fat if way

424
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:02,350
so with such that we try to do think
that nasa's and at weekends ago

425
00:26:02,350 --> 00:26:06,180
all those things falling for you no more
you visionary rather than passing

426
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:10,560
for all the things I think best kinda
the direction that we're trying to work

427
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:12,440
on

428
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:17,020
are for the first question is how how
can a I identify all the sink right

429
00:26:17,020 --> 00:26:20,980
are saws and zinc are is actually based
on

430
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:24,730
on on their Dom specification for
example does

431
00:26:24,730 --> 00:26:29,590
arts the sauce means dad for order
employed at can be modified by the user

432
00:26:29,590 --> 00:26:32,690
and I we lose happy wheels claim it is
assault speakers

433
00:26:32,690 --> 00:26:36,660
we can temper some and trusted aide over
there and and forth for the saint

434
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:42,140
also are although all those are for our
function on the dawn that can tackle

435
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:46,280
output and then we will cast by is a
sink so that that a style

436
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:50,320
we actually based on the dawn
specification and and a second

437
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:51,230
questioners

438
00:26:51,230 --> 00:26:54,570
are sorry are

439
00:26:54,570 --> 00:26:58,860
okay for the Explorer a pic is are we we
will try to fussed input if we

440
00:26:58,860 --> 00:27:02,830
distended score some well-known Paden
and and we will

441
00:27:02,830 --> 00:27:06,360
are weak actually have a database
collecting all those Paden

442
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:10,140
so we tried to use dat had into inject
intruder

443
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:13,560
our scanner and in to try to execute

444
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:17,670
if is is are it if we can be executed
and I will came into Starbucks as a

445
00:27:17,670 --> 00:27:24,670
swallow

446
00:27:29,740 --> 00:27:33,730
maybe a weekend top lobbyist this seems
like a we are running off camera

447
00:27:33,730 --> 00:27:36,860
on are

448
00:27:36,860 --> 00:27:37,659
thank you thank you thank you
