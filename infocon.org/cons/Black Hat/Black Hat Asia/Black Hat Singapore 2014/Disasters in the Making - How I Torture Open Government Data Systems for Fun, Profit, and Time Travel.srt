1
00:00:00,049 --> 00:00:03,090
are welcome eldest or password um

2
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:07,230
my talk is about open government systems
or any view from a government have any

3
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:07,819
kind

4
00:00:07,819 --> 00:00:11,450
K like okay that's yeah arm so it's

5
00:00:11,450 --> 00:00:14,519
I think it's you're you're really in the
weights session even know we started

6
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:14,910
late

7
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:18,830
because along the other sessions here
really really technical I'm not gonna be

8
00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:19,650
a tactical

9
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:23,130
I'll try to make it a little more fun
than tactical the other side is that

10
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:24,350
this is a problem

11
00:00:24,350 --> 00:00:28,269
that's on the upswing soul on the things
that I saw you today like you know your

12
00:00:28,269 --> 00:00:29,300
car has is

13
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:32,880
molar ability or you can exploit
JavaScript this way

14
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,230
I've done a fair amount that stuff over
the years but the reality is

15
00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:40,340
those problems get solved and then other
problems come along so when you're down

16
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:40,800
in the

17
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:44,890
gonna take you will trenches although
it's very interesting it's not the stop

18
00:00:44,890 --> 00:00:45,980
with staying power

19
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:50,230
I pretty will guarantee you that ten
years from now somebody maybe not me

20
00:00:50,230 --> 00:00:51,750
will be standing up here

21
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:55,910
talking to you about open government
data and why their own abilities

22
00:00:55,910 --> 00:00:59,280
a first-ball at standard disclaimers you
know I

23
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:03,239
I work for the university but these are
in their views some other things I'm

24
00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:05,350
gonna show you today I did the research

25
00:01:05,350 --> 00:01:10,260
a few years ago so they've been patched
up and I do like open date I don't want

26
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:11,240
to convey

27
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:15,180
in any way that I'm enemy open date I
think there's a lot of great things

28
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:15,939
about it

29
00:01:15,939 --> 00:01:19,729
i just want to see it done properly and
I'm not going to read every word on this

30
00:01:19,729 --> 00:01:20,799
like this I know

31
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:25,360
I'm between you and some ok all right
what is open data will governments

32
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,530
around the world are opening up the data

33
00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:32,259
the day used to keep you think about it
a government has the way to collect data

34
00:01:32,259 --> 00:01:36,369
I live in Canada someone is actually
going to jail

35
00:01:36,369 --> 00:01:40,140
because she refused to complete the
census on principle

36
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:43,890
she wouldn't fill out the document and
the government wants to send the woman

37
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:44,689
to jail

38
00:01:44,689 --> 00:01:49,540
so governments can compel you to give
data they can compel you

39
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:53,430
to pay taxes and things like that and
they have a lead data

40
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:58,149
what they're realizing is not if they
open up some good stuff can happen

41
00:01:58,149 --> 00:02:02,299
so they're a hacker thongs going on
where people go when they take all the

42
00:02:02,299 --> 00:02:03,210
government data

43
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:07,070
and they figure out new uses for it
another reason though is a

44
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:11,450
fear because they figure wikiLeaks is
going to get all our date anyway and put

45
00:02:11,450 --> 00:02:12,319
it out there

46
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:16,720
so we might as well let the public have
the data a very important one ish

47
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:17,599
cheapness

48
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:20,870
if you ride the subways in New York City
they have a sign up

49
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:24,800
that says all of our transit abs or
Wizkid

50
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:28,620
certified what do they mean by that they
didn't do it

51
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:33,230
the people who run the subways lead
other people use their data stream

52
00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:38,879
and monetize it so there's advertising
on it and the lead Google Transit to add

53
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:43,500
and they'd can do it better than them so
one good reason to open up the data

54
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:46,860
you ought to pay the program is not to
pay the app developers

55
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:50,420
you just let it happen and then there's
this whole wonderful you know

56
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:54,129
open source is great data wants to be
free and so on

57
00:02:54,129 --> 00:02:57,750
so there's a lot of pressure on all over
the world this is happening

58
00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:03,890
new york city philadelphia a consortium
in camera dojo bunches city is Vancouver

59
00:03:03,890 --> 00:03:09,370
admit intron 20 %uh the see you as a
contest and I'll tell you about

60
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:13,489
every year for the best usable Open Data
India has gone

61
00:03:13,489 --> 00:03:18,750
full steam ahead on this 51 government
departments pretty or all kinds of data

62
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:23,400
which is very interesting stuff and then
they were aside from government systems

63
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,450
there are systems

64
00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:28,870
that allows citizens to put data
directly out there for other people to

65
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:29,470
share

66
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:32,680
if am really show you our

67
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:37,980
13 problems is came up with a baker's
dozen 13 problems and I think are

68
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:41,819
important so they're down there at the
bottom a feature these but I'll tell you

69
00:03:41,819 --> 00:03:42,530
the story

70
00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:46,790
new york city puts out on socked over 6
2009

71
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:50,680
their 103 datasets that they say

72
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:54,920
or the beginning of their data mine with
your make all the data public

73
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:59,430
well the next day they're only 102
because they hadn't thought about one of

74
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:00,439
the datasets

75
00:04:00,439 --> 00:04:03,709
it contain the plywood email addresses

76
00:04:03,709 --> 00:04:08,599
and the secret questions for 1100
women's organization

77
00:04:08,599 --> 00:04:11,879
CEOs in the city so we now know that

78
00:04:11,879 --> 00:04:16,259
the favor question is what was your
first pet's name in the answer is fluffy

79
00:04:16,259 --> 00:04:21,040
your fluffy the cat so all at
confidential information got out there

80
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:25,740
so the first problem the think about is
a big gonna let the public have the data

81
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:30,310
make sure you read it first and take out
stoplight names and email addresses and

82
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:31,380
phone numbers

83
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:34,979
that's an easy one this is the City of
Toronto

84
00:04:34,979 --> 00:04:38,139
had to teach a little bit about Canadian
postal codes

85
00:04:38,139 --> 00:04:41,919
we have a six characters long postal
codes

86
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:45,720
so in fact you probably know that Santa
Claus lives in Canada

87
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:49,560
he lives at the North Pole and thats
said his address

88
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:52,600
why do we care about that wall this

89
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:56,009
flu strain allows you to determine

90
00:04:56,009 --> 00:04:59,710
watley where Santa lives or anybody else
in camera

91
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:03,229
and then the West amid fills in exactly
where they are

92
00:05:03,229 --> 00:05:07,720
so it's called the forward sorting area
and then the rest of the postal code lol

93
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:09,039
the rest is call

94
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:14,259
why do I say this will this is the
municipal complaint reporting

95
00:05:14,259 --> 00:05:17,889
up from Troy 120 for a period in
December

96
00:05:17,889 --> 00:05:22,800
and as you can see what they're supposed
to do is if somebody makes a complaint

97
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:26,270
this post to put in the first three
digits as opposed to go

98
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:30,009
so what happens if you do that then
you've narrowed it down to an area of

99
00:05:30,009 --> 00:05:30,810
the city

100
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:35,289
javan pointed a finger at an individual
but as you can tell sometimes they do

101
00:05:35,289 --> 00:05:37,039
something else they put in

102
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:40,970
the intersection which streets well as
you can imagine

103
00:05:40,970 --> 00:05:44,410
if you go out there and look on Google
Maps or something there gonna be some

104
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:46,639
streets where that pretty well tell you

105
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:50,970
who made the complaint know why do we
care about that because people

106
00:05:50,970 --> 00:05:55,360
expect this day to be confidential if
they complain about something to the

107
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,039
city in

108
00:05:56,039 --> 00:06:00,650
you can tell what they complain about
Norway's icy sidewalks a problem that

109
00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:01,990
you all have here

110
00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:05,139
arm damaged sidewalks and things like
that

111
00:06:05,139 --> 00:06:09,970
so the moral of this story is to be
careful about what you called ada

112
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:16,289
granularity so data granularity is
helpline the you divide your data

113
00:06:16,289 --> 00:06:21,050
if you make it to find the you might be
pointing the finger at a person

114
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:24,419
and the whole idea is you wanna make the
data available

115
00:06:24,419 --> 00:06:27,620
but you never want somebody to be able
to learn

116
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:31,520
details about a particular person as
you'll see in this talk

117
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:35,810
there's a lotta ways that that happens
10 the technique so we talk about is

118
00:06:35,810 --> 00:06:36,979
dated jigsaw

119
00:06:36,979 --> 00:06:40,100
line where you put together different
information

120
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:43,520
so for example going back to those
reports there

121
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:46,900
if I went to Logan Avenue in Danforth
area

122
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:49,940
Avenue in Toronto with Google Maps

123
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:54,740
I can look and see you know is there
only one house there which house it is

124
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:59,720
so that's putting data from different
databases together

125
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:03,110
he why do we care all this is a
now-defunct website

126
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:06,430
it used to be that even in like your
neighbor anyway released in North

127
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:07,539
America

128
00:07:07,539 --> 00:07:11,000
you could just put their address in and
say whatever you wanted about them

129
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:15,610
like she's a mean dog lady your watch
your kids around this trailer you know

130
00:07:15,610 --> 00:07:16,940
things like that

131
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:20,780
and I he was a website called what
neighbor dot com

132
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:24,740
and the real I show it to use to show
you that people will put out information

133
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:26,470
about their neighbors

134
00:07:26,470 --> 00:07:29,789
in fact I have the map above downtown
Calgary

135
00:07:29,789 --> 00:07:34,259
I you'll recognize because you lived in
Calgary are that we have the will bring

136
00:07:34,259 --> 00:07:35,650
the bowl river there

137
00:07:35,650 --> 00:07:39,009
and all-new rent houses or what
neighbors

138
00:07:39,009 --> 00:07:44,789
the only greenhouse here is a bow on
what we call the Calgary Stampede

139
00:07:44,789 --> 00:07:45,470
grounds

140
00:07:45,470 --> 00:07:48,870
where we have the Calgary Flames a
hockey team and so on

141
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:52,310
so what this proves is that people are
kinda been flying

142
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:56,879
to complain about other people and say
that they leave their garbage in the

143
00:07:56,879 --> 00:07:58,620
lane or something like that

144
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:02,669
you can even say that somebody is a sex
offender with at their house has been

145
00:08:02,669 --> 00:08:04,789
foreclosed on their mortgage

146
00:08:04,789 --> 00:08:08,550
so this website locally doesn't exist
anymore

147
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:12,720
okay it's got however it's been replaced
by other ones

148
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:18,550
this is actually a service that ones in
many cities certainly in North America

149
00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:21,610
called seat Lake pics

150
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:25,330
soviet go to see Lake thanks dot com

151
00:08:25,330 --> 00:08:30,020
and put in a city like Calgary you can
either report a problem

152
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:33,610
we can read about a problem I want to
show you that

153
00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:36,630
people will complain about stop so here
we have

154
00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:39,659
two different complaints about the same
car wash

155
00:08:39,659 --> 00:08:43,719
obviously there's somebody who doesn't
like the fact is there's a car wash in

156
00:08:43,719 --> 00:08:44,800
his neighborhood

157
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:48,959
and we can kinda track on this system
that he's complaining about it

158
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:53,930
sobil people are complainers sometimes
though this information is important

159
00:08:53,930 --> 00:08:56,959
okay he was complaining about the icy
road

160
00:08:56,959 --> 00:09:01,330
you may remember a few weeks ago some
buildings in manhattan blew up

161
00:09:01,330 --> 00:09:05,019
was a gas leak and somebody might point
to you

162
00:09:05,019 --> 00:09:09,170
to something that's important so that's
kinda the the tradeoff there you don't

163
00:09:09,170 --> 00:09:10,990
want to ignore this information

164
00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:15,170
where you might have a big hole in fact
one on the system which i think is a

165
00:09:15,170 --> 00:09:16,690
pretty good one

166
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:21,589
coordinates what citizens report so here
it is broken windows

167
00:09:21,589 --> 00:09:24,640
heaters do not word broken doors and so
on

168
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:28,060
in a building and then they've attached
a photograph

169
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:32,250
so here it looks again just like some
citizen complaining

170
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:36,089
but then you see down here that there's
actually action

171
00:09:36,089 --> 00:09:40,250
so the administrator of the city of
Philadelphia in this case

172
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:43,690
weeds these things and actually does
something about it

173
00:09:43,690 --> 00:09:48,120
so that's kinda the answer to take this
data and have somebody who's responsible

174
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:48,930
actually

175
00:09:48,930 --> 00:09:52,649
look at it and do something about it

176
00:09:52,649 --> 00:09:55,649
this is actually very interesting
project um

177
00:09:55,649 --> 00:10:00,089
I'm sure you are familiar with drones in
you on manned aerial vehicles

178
00:10:00,089 --> 00:10:03,620
a guy that I know has been flying a
drone all over

179
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:06,649
Calgary where I live looking at homes

180
00:10:06,649 --> 00:10:10,950
to see who uses who waz the most energy

181
00:10:10,950 --> 00:10:14,290
so in other ways whose with a thermal
camera

182
00:10:14,290 --> 00:10:18,860
whose house is giving of the most energy
and based on the colour

183
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:21,970
that he puts on your on this map here

184
00:10:21,970 --> 00:10:27,120
you are shown to be either conserving
energy are wasting energy

185
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:30,320
and that's useful information he is the
best intentions

186
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:34,010
however there you know number things
that can be deduced

187
00:10:34,010 --> 00:10:37,600
from how much energy you use we have
this problem

188
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:41,220
they're called marijuana grow-ops so
every once in a while

189
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:44,290
somebody will be growing some plants in
their house they have a whole indoor

190
00:10:44,290 --> 00:10:45,140
farm

191
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:50,010
and they'll be that right now so they're
so what happens is for told me in this

192
00:10:50,010 --> 00:10:51,050
in reasons

193
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:54,610
flying is drone to help people save
energy

194
00:10:54,610 --> 00:10:57,810
he is handing the police a map to the
grow ops

195
00:10:57,810 --> 00:11:01,779
and I talked to him about any so well I
never intended to do that

196
00:11:01,779 --> 00:11:05,390
you know you didn't but that's
effectively what happened to sir where

197
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:06,550
you know it's okay

198
00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:10,990
because I have this special provisions
if somebody wants to

199
00:11:10,990 --> 00:11:14,790
opt out of my system even though I flew
over his house

200
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:19,190
I can do is all menace house and say
this home has been with withheld at the

201
00:11:19,190 --> 00:11:20,380
owner's request

202
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:23,589
well that is an express map for the
police to go there

203
00:11:23,589 --> 00:11:28,019
because something is really face you and
the reason I sure this example

204
00:11:28,019 --> 00:11:31,930
is to say that sometimes just so many
somebody's data

205
00:11:31,930 --> 00:11:35,279
really doesn't do any good in fact the
points the finger at them

206
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:38,519
so there's all of a sudden leaders
that's why it's you know such an

207
00:11:38,519 --> 00:11:39,950
interesting feel

208
00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:44,130
okay the europeans his Wii a little bit
low but a computer science here

209
00:11:44,130 --> 00:11:50,120
they had a contest know of a twenty
thousand euros which while on a beer

210
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:54,440
for the best application will open data
and this was the first one

211
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:58,630
there 434 entries from 24 different
countries

212
00:11:58,630 --> 00:12:02,519
and the winner was this one from
Slovenia

213
00:12:02,519 --> 00:12:06,089
and it is called Jeff Nash key or
whatever but

214
00:12:06,089 --> 00:12:09,990
it means from our taxes and here's the
computer science part of it

215
00:12:09,990 --> 00:12:14,310
what they did is they went out to
government databases

216
00:12:14,310 --> 00:12:18,430
and look for names names of the CEO of
companies

217
00:12:18,430 --> 00:12:22,810
names have lawyers names of Directors to
try to figure out

218
00:12:22,810 --> 00:12:25,889
who is getting what a government
contracts

219
00:12:25,889 --> 00:12:29,399
so when the government gives a contract
they always disclose that information

220
00:12:29,399 --> 00:12:30,540
they say

221
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:33,700
we deal with the strong log construction
company

222
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:38,620
and so and so was their present solely
really did was put this stuff together

223
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:43,930
but amazingly certain friends if the
government were getting lotsa contracts

224
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:47,740
now you would think sense is public
information they were doing a great

225
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:48,600
service

226
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:53,320
and in fact they won the contest they
then found their backsides in cord

227
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:58,139
being sued by someone who said she
didn't want to be in this database

228
00:12:58,139 --> 00:13:01,820
okay she %uh Jarmila pub

229
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:07,110
puzzle Norwell on the straw bag
construction company demanded in cord

230
00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:11,459
that the value of hard contracts be
removed from the site

231
00:13:11,459 --> 00:13:15,579
here's the interesting poor how do you
remove data when you have the data

232
00:13:15,579 --> 00:13:19,200
all this thing was was a wee streaming

233
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:23,579
updated that was in government databases
they were just bringing together

234
00:13:23,579 --> 00:13:27,860
so they'd look that the judge and they
said you know what do you want us to do

235
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:29,500
it's not even are data

236
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:33,649
and the judge said do it and this gives
us problem number four

237
00:13:33,649 --> 00:13:38,190
judges are about 10 years behind the
average intelligent person in

238
00:13:38,190 --> 00:13:39,949
understanding technology

239
00:13:39,949 --> 00:13:43,320
so when you have lawsuits like this it's
because a judge

240
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:47,000
still remembers his Commodore PET
computer or something

241
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:51,010
and thinks that that's what computers
are about the other problem is data can

242
00:13:51,010 --> 00:13:53,829
live in many places so data can be
copied

243
00:13:53,829 --> 00:13:57,000
it can be stored somewhere and you don't
even know where it leads

244
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,740
so the latest I heard they have appealed
that ruling and they're still in

245
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:01,820
operation

246
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:05,920
but the Rio your computer science thing
is how do you take down data

247
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:10,019
you don't even control I guess you could
put a filter in there that somehow

248
00:14:10,019 --> 00:14:13,630
in that data but there would be a lot of
work

249
00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:17,639
I you know he is innocent interest in
one from a city in Canada call that in

250
00:14:17,639 --> 00:14:18,300
turn

251
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:22,990
and they had a mayoral election where
this guy name Stephen Mandel did really

252
00:14:22,990 --> 00:14:23,510
well

253
00:14:23,510 --> 00:14:26,850
he got most on the boat so in particular

254
00:14:26,850 --> 00:14:32,430
he got a hundred nine thousand for 232
the next candidate got 58,000

255
00:14:32,430 --> 00:14:37,740
and some low the lesser candidates got
very few boats know why do we care about

256
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:38,279
this

257
00:14:38,279 --> 00:14:41,720
because when you put a doubt like this
you have to be careful

258
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:46,380
you do want the people to know what the
election results of that's important

259
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:52,500
made as public data however and here I
had to give your bedroom a hypothetical

260
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:57,829
here we have a poll it happens to be the
citywide hospital poll

261
00:14:57,829 --> 00:15:01,860
if you happen to be in the hospital on
election day

262
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:05,399
incentive you going to bode they bring
the bow to you

263
00:15:05,399 --> 00:15:09,389
the late you vote from your deathbed or
whatever to say who you would want to be

264
00:15:09,389 --> 00:15:10,339
mayor

265
00:15:10,339 --> 00:15:13,470
now we notice that mister David Dowling
God

266
00:15:13,470 --> 00:15:16,699
0 votes in the city white hospital por

267
00:15:16,699 --> 00:15:20,860
why do we care well you know let's say
Dave's wife was in hospital

268
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:25,750
and he comes in ill honey did you vote
all yeah I born I i voted for you

269
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:27,779
anymore for you well she's lying

270
00:15:27,779 --> 00:15:31,660
because nobody voted for him in any
hospital in Edmond

271
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:35,940
now this is a contrived example but it
makes the point I hope

272
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:39,019
know when you have a very small numbers
you don't

273
00:15:39,019 --> 00:15:43,810
report them you just say not significant
it really doesn't matter Dave got zero

274
00:15:43,810 --> 00:15:45,269
votes or five boats

275
00:15:45,269 --> 00:15:48,660
he's not going to be the mayor anyway so

276
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:53,750
people can make inferences about
individuals from small numbers

277
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:58,470
gay I did a really interesting study of
campaign finances so this is when people

278
00:15:58,470 --> 00:15:59,690
don't need

279
00:15:59,690 --> 00:16:03,889
to political candidates and learned an
awful lot from doing this

280
00:16:03,889 --> 00:16:08,529
arm first of all the laws in the United
States well written in nineteen eighty

281
00:16:08,529 --> 00:16:12,399
and just remind you that's what a
state-of-the-art computer look like the

282
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:14,040
32k memory

283
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:18,519
in a Commodore PET computer you could
run busy coke in your spreadsheets and

284
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:19,540
stuff like that

285
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:24,560
on old computer back then of course no
data mining made you put in another

286
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:27,370
cassette tape rate so the thing I G had

287
00:16:27,370 --> 00:16:31,850
a cassette player there that you would
you put tapes into

288
00:16:31,850 --> 00:16:36,660
so now it's totally change in a sense we
have tremendous computer power

289
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:40,130
and photo of you put all their campaign
finance records up

290
00:16:40,130 --> 00:16:45,279
online and when I first in this study it
said you can view them in print them but

291
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:45,600
you

292
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:49,370
they're not available for download well
I downloaded them anyway

293
00:16:49,370 --> 00:16:53,630
and I'll tell you I L first they said
give me all the candidates

294
00:16:53,630 --> 00:16:57,170
whose names be last name begins with the
letter A

295
00:16:57,170 --> 00:17:02,209
and then I did be man I did see and I
went through the alphabet 26 times

296
00:17:02,209 --> 00:17:06,789
and I had all the spreadsheet I merge
them into one big spreadsheet

297
00:17:06,789 --> 00:17:11,199
so now I own their database I have their
complete contribution database

298
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:16,549
so wasn't long until I had some comma
separated files that I could play well

299
00:17:16,549 --> 00:17:21,179
so the first thing to realize I i made
up this word torturing the data

300
00:17:21,179 --> 00:17:24,179
as you can imagine when you try to make
the data

301
00:17:24,179 --> 00:17:28,870
tell you stop that they didn't want to
tell you I call a day to torturing

302
00:17:28,870 --> 00:17:33,100
so all these controls that are set up
here are in for the data torturer

303
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:33,559
there's

304
00:17:33,559 --> 00:17:37,580
there with the general public in mind
here's what I found out

305
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:42,120
for some wall you have to give an
address when you make a contribution

306
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:46,789
a senior thing a number people in the US
have long listed telephone number they

307
00:17:46,789 --> 00:17:48,490
value their privacy

308
00:17:48,490 --> 00:17:51,760
then owen et by didn't know their
address or phone number

309
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:56,140
in fact people pay extra to have a phone
number that are listed

310
00:17:56,140 --> 00:18:00,860
in this case the philadelphia government
took their last seven years

311
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:04,650
contributions and they put them out on
the Internet

312
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:07,780
in this kinda format so you had the name

313
00:18:07,780 --> 00:18:12,230
up hard while lead you had the address
you had the amount

314
00:18:12,230 --> 00:18:16,539
hobble League a five dollars and you had
something about where the contribution

315
00:18:16,539 --> 00:18:17,919
was made

316
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:20,929
who is made to now

317
00:18:20,929 --> 00:18:24,380
I was looking through these things in
one in the interesting things you can do

318
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:26,929
with government data is plotted on a map

319
00:18:26,929 --> 00:18:31,730
let me up a plunger on a map here
Philadelphia Philadelphia Ridge New

320
00:18:31,730 --> 00:18:33,580
Jersey which is near Philadelphia

321
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:38,470
arlington massachusetts no way to know
why is somebody from massachusetts

322
00:18:38,470 --> 00:18:43,059
contributing to a local kind in
philadelphia even better his name is why

323
00:18:43,059 --> 00:18:44,150
we're best

324
00:18:44,150 --> 00:18:49,160
who certainly our essay algorithm well
he's the route they all are in the RS a

325
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:53,950
will vest shamir edelman and they re is
that's one smiling face

326
00:18:53,950 --> 00:18:58,120
now please note it is not illegal were
so many Massachusetts

327
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:01,970
to give money to another jurisdiction
like Philadelphia

328
00:19:01,970 --> 00:19:06,549
it's weird but it's not illegal he a two
hundred dollars to stuff me singer

329
00:19:06,549 --> 00:19:11,620
so an interesting point there's I just
by plugging a stop on a map you can find

330
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:12,870
things like that

331
00:19:12,870 --> 00:19:16,309
I she did a little more digging you also
gave to Brock Obama

332
00:19:16,309 --> 00:19:20,690
arm he gave a twenty-five hundred
dollars to Obama's anybody gave another

333
00:19:20,690 --> 00:19:22,400
thousand dollars to Obama

334
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:27,070
but in polling that we poured I start to
learn more about up

335
00:19:27,070 --> 00:19:30,270
there's someone named Gail where best to
mite will be his wife

336
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:35,200
and she gave to Obama to and she's not
employed to school won't hear

337
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:39,020
but then there's so many new alexander
who's an MIT postdoc

338
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:43,950
gave to Obama to so you start putting
all these data bases which are all

339
00:19:43,950 --> 00:19:45,330
public together

340
00:19:45,330 --> 00:19:49,150
you get a pretty good pitcher why we're
best in this family

341
00:19:49,150 --> 00:19:53,789
told me without his permission when I
dug a little deeper into this

342
00:19:53,789 --> 00:19:57,789
I got the most common separated files
and I want to know

343
00:19:57,789 --> 00:20:02,500
do you mean really need my address well
one answer is simple the law says

344
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:06,030
you have to provide your name occupation
and address

345
00:20:06,030 --> 00:20:10,240
okay so Joe Smith carpenter and here's
an address

346
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:13,860
doesn't say your home address but I
don't really know the only reason really

347
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:15,440
to have the address

348
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:18,929
is to find out if there's to John
Smith's

349
00:20:18,929 --> 00:20:23,190
maybe they're the same and maybe they're
different so I ran an experiment white

350
00:20:23,190 --> 00:20:23,770
choc

351
00:20:23,770 --> 00:20:27,679
the three most common names in the
United States surname Smith

352
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:31,530
Johnson and Williams account to pee so
this data

353
00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:35,730
that's how many image there were and
then using a very generous

354
00:20:35,730 --> 00:20:40,350
definition a duplicate switches could it
possibly confuse me

355
00:20:40,350 --> 00:20:44,010
I went through and iPhone eight
duplicates in the Smiths three in

356
00:20:44,010 --> 00:20:44,900
Johnson

357
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:48,480
Warren Williams so my conclusion is that
how many address

358
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:52,450
we really didn't do a lot to help you
sort out duplicates

359
00:20:52,450 --> 00:20:55,730
but it gave everybody's address away

360
00:20:55,730 --> 00:20:59,450
which is kinda mood you know in be
something to do

361
00:20:59,450 --> 00:21:03,230
but then it got even better cuz while
playing with the dade I notice said 86

362
00:21:03,230 --> 00:21:04,270
on the Smiths

363
00:21:04,270 --> 00:21:07,980
63 the Johnson and so on all

364
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:12,280
gave the same address so I forget this
must be like the large is rooming house

365
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:13,610
in the world or something

366
00:21:13,610 --> 00:21:17,429
if they all lived there so went to
Google Maps and took a look at it

367
00:21:17,429 --> 00:21:20,500
and did indeed find that it is the

368
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:24,669
authors up the International Brotherhood
of Electrical Workers

369
00:21:24,669 --> 00:21:27,799
so here's what we start to withdraw some
inferences

370
00:21:27,799 --> 00:21:31,789
why are all these people give me that
address well this is where you go if

371
00:21:31,789 --> 00:21:33,039
you're in electricity in

372
00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:36,220
when you need a job be going to the
hiring all their

373
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:39,980
and they give you a job it looks like
they also were making it

374
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:43,950
a sale is very convenient to make
political donations

375
00:21:43,950 --> 00:21:49,330
to the candidate of their choice so we
can start to learn really interesting

376
00:21:49,330 --> 00:21:50,000
stuff

377
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,710
that would never have come up any other
way and certainly not at the end but the

378
00:21:53,710 --> 00:21:56,280
data out there

379
00:21:56,280 --> 00:22:00,320
so one thing I've found is that the date
was inconsistent you had to give an

380
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:02,929
address it doesn't say your home address
you gave

381
00:22:02,929 --> 00:22:06,520
1600 Pennsylvania Avenue Northwest which
is the white house

382
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:10,730
that's an address Barack Obama's address
now

383
00:22:10,730 --> 00:22:15,990
also policy issues somebody decided in
nineteen eighty

384
00:22:15,990 --> 00:22:19,980
that this data need to be collected and
nobody's apparently thought about it

385
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:24,289
since then but so much has changed we
have these new tools like

386
00:22:24,289 --> 00:22:28,460
Dana mapping API's in big data programs
and so on

387
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:33,830
so is really time to flee to make the
wall idea why we require it

388
00:22:33,830 --> 00:22:38,049
a matchup with the hell we can do he's
elusive fellow

389
00:22:38,049 --> 00:22:43,090
that I kinda know he started in airline
call Wes chatty get very rich as names

390
00:22:43,090 --> 00:22:44,120
ply better 0

391
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:49,059
I do this little assault on him six
years ago without his permission just to

392
00:22:49,059 --> 00:22:50,510
see what I can find out

393
00:22:50,510 --> 00:22:54,280
well poor ol plied watches picture of a
corporate brochure

394
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:58,000
look them up on the telephone directory
which is online

395
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,030
and I have obscured some other stuff
here because

396
00:23:01,030 --> 00:23:04,340
his address and home phone number in the
telephone directory

397
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:08,250
so we have to say just a very trusting
God right so he put himself

398
00:23:08,250 --> 00:23:11,549
in the phone book I sent through the
phone number because it's still his

399
00:23:11,549 --> 00:23:12,429
phone number

400
00:23:12,429 --> 00:23:16,360
is pretty important guy you know we he
created a whole airline

401
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:19,390
then I went to the address and I got
there and you the City of Calgary

402
00:23:19,390 --> 00:23:21,370
assessment again

403
00:23:21,370 --> 00:23:24,900
tax assessment data is always public

404
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:30,360
because you have a way to know in
general your property taxes based on

405
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:35,110
the value of your house and if your
neighbor's house is identical to yours

406
00:23:35,110 --> 00:23:38,980
the taxes ought to be the same if your
neighbor's house is twice as nice as

407
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:39,740
yours

408
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:43,710
then the taxes should be double the
reality is is always a bit of a fight

409
00:23:43,710 --> 00:23:46,070
there so the way gets sorted out

410
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:49,789
is they make this data public now how do
they make his day to public

411
00:23:49,789 --> 00:23:53,870
ten years ago for one month every year

412
00:23:53,870 --> 00:23:57,669
you go to a community center and there
was a book fair

413
00:23:57,669 --> 00:24:01,700
new good look at that book would you
couldn't taken away you couldn't you

414
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:02,659
could make nodes

415
00:24:02,659 --> 00:24:07,340
would you can photocopy it who's like I
vicious sweaty old lady holding on to

416
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:08,120
the book

417
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:12,250
and she would keep you from taking away
back then we didn't have smart phones

418
00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:13,770
with cameras he couldn't

419
00:24:13,770 --> 00:24:17,090
snap a picture but but you may call a
note you want you

420
00:24:17,090 --> 00:24:21,200
then some genius said let's put this
thing online and this is in fact plied

421
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:22,360
that all cells

422
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:27,419
so again I obliterated the address but
we see its assessed that so many dollars

423
00:24:27,419 --> 00:24:30,570
we see how many square feet in as and so
on

424
00:24:30,570 --> 00:24:35,150
and that information is everything that
the city knows about us out

425
00:24:35,150 --> 00:24:38,500
but they also resented this way

426
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:43,150
so there's his house at the Red Dot 70
10,500

427
00:24:43,150 --> 00:24:48,370
and his neighbors have houses betar
lower assessment presumably not as nice

428
00:24:48,370 --> 00:24:48,799
but

429
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:53,510
I don't know now the thing that's
interesting about this is first wall we

430
00:24:53,510 --> 00:24:55,330
can see all those data presented

431
00:24:55,330 --> 00:25:00,330
but also there was an online anticipated
consequence and this is really important

432
00:25:00,330 --> 00:25:01,919
government data

433
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:05,279
people will try to think a ways to make
money there's a

434
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:08,890
buncha companies that every year when
your tax assessment comes

435
00:25:08,890 --> 00:25:12,330
they drop a card in your mailbox do you
think your

436
00:25:12,330 --> 00:25:16,460
assessment is too high past five hundred
dollars a we will go

437
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:20,520
we will fight it in court for you will
now think it's %uh know where this is

438
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:22,169
dear mister apply bed or

439
00:25:22,169 --> 00:25:26,860
or deer owner of this address you did
you know that your assessment 27 yr

440
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:28,440
10,500

441
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:31,940
and the house next use only six hundred
thirty-four thousand

442
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:34,950
and the one on the other side is for
nearly 14,000

443
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:39,010
they have a lot more day to put in that
letter and then they say the same thing

444
00:25:39,010 --> 00:25:40,669
give us five hundred dollars

445
00:25:40,669 --> 00:25:45,270
will go fight for you and you know the
reality is that often they do when I saw

446
00:25:45,270 --> 00:25:47,070
a guy get a million dollars

447
00:25:47,070 --> 00:25:50,370
shaved off his house assessment in court
ones so

448
00:25:50,370 --> 00:25:55,200
this freaked out the city they said
although our data is being misused

449
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:58,809
so they shut the whole system now and I
mean they asked me what to do about a

450
00:25:58,809 --> 00:26:00,039
game an idea

451
00:26:00,039 --> 00:26:03,990
or they eventually did is they we open
the System

452
00:26:03,990 --> 00:26:08,270
with new safeguards so this is the
answer to how to do a better

453
00:26:08,270 --> 00:26:12,279
the first thing is they put a big
honking legal disclaimer here

454
00:26:12,279 --> 00:26:16,090
this license does not give me any way to
resale commercial: you so the site

455
00:26:16,090 --> 00:26:19,130
so they can basically take you to court
and sue you

456
00:26:19,130 --> 00:26:23,700
if you steal it or use their data in
ways that it's not intended to

457
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:28,260
in theory I guess they can take me to
court cuz want to the use is not making

458
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:30,289
presentations in Singapore rate

459
00:26:30,289 --> 00:26:33,630
is only supposed to be there for tax use

460
00:26:33,630 --> 00:26:38,490
the other thing they did was technical
they sorted out so that if you just want

461
00:26:38,490 --> 00:26:40,320
to see the assessment number

462
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:43,860
you can still do that but you want all
those other details like the square

463
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:44,500
footage

464
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:48,360
you have to register give her name give
me your address

465
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:51,470
in you then have an account with them
you charge any money

466
00:26:51,470 --> 00:26:56,429
but they do collect data on you they
also put in a technical restriction

467
00:26:56,429 --> 00:26:57,970
which is little laughable

468
00:26:57,970 --> 00:27:02,350
foam anyone IP address you can only do
20 properties per day

469
00:27:02,350 --> 00:27:05,850
when you're my students who couldn't
spoof the IP for that you know should

470
00:27:05,850 --> 00:27:09,620
should fail computer science right
because pretty easy to do

471
00:27:09,620 --> 00:27:12,950
and the other thing is that they didn't
think about so most people want to do a

472
00:27:12,950 --> 00:27:14,289
whole like 20

473
00:27:14,289 --> 00:27:18,429
apartment apartment building now means
they can do it one day because they can

474
00:27:18,429 --> 00:27:20,140
only do 20 in a day

475
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:25,659
lissy know how to spoof the IP the whole
different topic in this is a kind a US

476
00:27:25,659 --> 00:27:27,950
entered one but a fascinating one

477
00:27:27,950 --> 00:27:31,850
are tried very hard not to get arrested
particularly in florida

478
00:27:31,850 --> 00:27:36,470
because in the United States share apps
are you elected officials

479
00:27:36,470 --> 00:27:40,370
they have to go and be reelected every
four years or whatever

480
00:27:40,370 --> 00:27:44,130
and of course the way that they show
that they're doing a good job as sheriff

481
00:27:44,130 --> 00:27:48,100
is a show you who they arrested so there
we have the mug shots

482
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:52,149
0 why we're jarmin ask you for domestic
battery

483
00:27:52,149 --> 00:27:56,470
she violated probation and roll with the
suspenders driver's license

484
00:27:56,470 --> 00:28:00,279
and so on and so on and the thing to
know is that these are people he

485
00:28:00,279 --> 00:28:00,890
arrested

486
00:28:00,890 --> 00:28:04,299
we don't know that they're guilty of
these things we just know he arrested

487
00:28:04,299 --> 00:28:05,590
them for that

488
00:28:05,590 --> 00:28:09,010
the other thing is that it stays up
there for 30 days here's where it gets

489
00:28:09,010 --> 00:28:11,130
really creepy

490
00:28:11,130 --> 00:28:14,710
there we have and I've obliterated the
face and the name

491
00:28:14,710 --> 00:28:18,580
from this record up the young man whose
name was Bobby

492
00:28:18,580 --> 00:28:22,580
he was born in 1997 he was arrested in
2010

493
00:28:22,580 --> 00:28:27,440
I will save you doing the math he is 12
years and two months old who is a child

494
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:31,860
legal a minor child and his photos up on
the Internet

495
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:35,240
and his accuser who burglary of a
dwelling

496
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:39,399
now we don't know whether Bobby did not
we do know that this is a pretty

497
00:28:39,399 --> 00:28:41,779
terrible thing to do to a 12-year-old
kid

498
00:28:41,779 --> 00:28:45,659
I took this evidence to the Privacy
Commissioner in Canada

499
00:28:45,659 --> 00:28:49,659
who said we would never allow that we
would like you know come down hard on

500
00:28:49,659 --> 00:28:50,299
any

501
00:28:50,299 --> 00:28:53,700
police officer who did something like
this so we don't

502
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:58,620
do that but in the US there's a kind o
simple way to post up but

503
00:28:58,620 --> 00:29:02,529
it is true that this is probably a
mistake they probably should be

504
00:29:02,529 --> 00:29:06,630
posting kids but now we've got this

505
00:29:06,630 --> 00:29:10,659
there's a hole in my sin among showed
website for this all started with Bill

506
00:29:10,659 --> 00:29:12,779
Gates and Lindsay Lindsay Lohan

507
00:29:12,779 --> 00:29:17,020
and their mug shots being posted but now
just about everybody's much I guess

508
00:29:17,020 --> 00:29:18,090
posted

509
00:29:18,090 --> 00:29:21,340
and the guy who runs a site is very
interesting he says well

510
00:29:21,340 --> 00:29:25,630
is public information and its my
patriotic duty

511
00:29:25,630 --> 00:29:29,080
to make sure that people know who the
bad criminals or

512
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:33,539
so I put their mug shot up now that
sounds great on to you see that

513
00:29:33,539 --> 00:29:38,730
anytime between 7 a.m. and 11 p.m. you
can call him with your credit card

514
00:29:38,730 --> 00:29:42,330
and you on published a photo for 499
dollars

515
00:29:42,330 --> 00:29:46,460
so yes he wants people know about bad
guys but not so badly that he'll turn

516
00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:48,360
down your 499

517
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:52,320
the weirdest thing I found out about
this site is they have another thing

518
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:55,659
where if you really hate somebody you
can give you

519
00:29:55,659 --> 00:29:59,929
for ninety nine dollars and then the
photo never comes down usual photos come

520
00:29:59,929 --> 00:30:01,059
down in a month

521
00:30:01,059 --> 00:30:05,190
is cool permanently publishing so if you
really hate some way you can do that

522
00:30:05,190 --> 00:30:08,370
and I have nowhere to do what happens if
both requests come in

523
00:30:08,370 --> 00:30:13,409
you but we just takes money anyway right
so this is legal it is gradually being

524
00:30:13,409 --> 00:30:14,390
fought

525
00:30:14,390 --> 00:30:18,179
by dr. on state of Oregon just outlaw
did

526
00:30:18,179 --> 00:30:21,669
but the people really gonna kill list or
the

527
00:30:21,669 --> 00:30:25,380
credit card companies and Google how
they gonna do that

528
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:28,779
the credit card companies gonna stop
allowing the mug shot people

529
00:30:28,779 --> 00:30:32,580
to take credit cards which will make it
very hard for him to take your money

530
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:37,169
up to use big point or something like
that and and that's pretty dicey

531
00:30:37,169 --> 00:30:41,270
ghouls role is there right now love you
get arrested

532
00:30:41,270 --> 00:30:46,740
your mug shot dot com hit will probably
come up near the top

533
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:49,880
who is we Jadyn their ranking algorithm

534
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:54,270
so it'll drop much lower so other things
you do i mean you could have been a

535
00:30:54,270 --> 00:30:57,620
you know an upstanding citizen for
twenty years and then you got arrested

536
00:30:57,620 --> 00:30:58,279
once

537
00:30:58,279 --> 00:31:02,750
and that something is going to show up
first so Google is gonna fix it so these

538
00:31:02,750 --> 00:31:07,840
search results or demoted he the news
vulnerability it's coming along as your

539
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:08,820
face

540
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:12,559
are there was just a apply to call name
tag announced

541
00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:16,510
I have a good friend who does a lot of
work in facial recognition is

542
00:31:16,510 --> 00:31:19,659
Alexander aqui stay at Carnegie Mellon
and

543
00:31:19,659 --> 00:31:22,720
Alexander most famous experiment

544
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:26,580
was he took all the people who are on
Facebook

545
00:31:26,580 --> 00:31:30,630
young people basically in Pittsburgh in
any way to those dating site called

546
00:31:30,630 --> 00:31:31,950
Match dot com

547
00:31:31,950 --> 00:31:36,019
when people sign up for a dating site
the usual give their name

548
00:31:36,019 --> 00:31:40,210
they make up a pseudonym like sexy babe
to 35 yr

549
00:31:40,210 --> 00:31:45,299
hung guy 404 and you only know them by
that name on

550
00:31:45,299 --> 00:31:48,470
lest they wanna made up with you or meet
up with you

551
00:31:48,470 --> 00:31:53,269
which case they you you learn their real
name well example when the two photo

552
00:31:53,269 --> 00:31:54,840
databases together

553
00:31:54,840 --> 00:32:00,149
and about 35 percent of the time he
could find out who sexy babe to 35 years

554
00:32:00,149 --> 00:32:04,620
from your Facebook photos even knows a
different photo so facial recognition is

555
00:32:04,620 --> 00:32:06,149
getting better and better

556
00:32:06,149 --> 00:32:09,720
so much so that there's this app now
former name tag

557
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:13,179
WS where you point your soap on it
somebody

558
00:32:13,179 --> 00:32:16,450
youth like it and look some up in
various databases

559
00:32:16,450 --> 00:32:19,940
way now the only one that they have is
the sex offender database

560
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:23,179
so you'll know if she's a sex offender
in our but

561
00:32:23,179 --> 00:32:26,750
in the future if they had Facebook in
there now that would make a pretty

562
00:32:26,750 --> 00:32:27,620
powerful

563
00:32:27,620 --> 00:32:31,750
so what I'm suggesting is a your faces
at you becoming quite a

564
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:36,919
a vulnerability us making a face I want
to serve the top coat of here but

565
00:32:36,919 --> 00:32:40,350
this is actually India that

566
00:32:40,350 --> 00:32:44,500
I they put a webcam in some government
offers I think it's hilarious

567
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:48,929
and the reasoning behind it is there so
much bribery there

568
00:32:48,929 --> 00:32:53,960
I but there's there's a website in India
call I paid a bribe got calm down I and

569
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:57,330
we're basing report provided you paid
right well

570
00:32:57,330 --> 00:33:01,659
the theory here is that if you hand in
your money's the Chief Minister of

571
00:33:01,659 --> 00:33:02,390
Kerala

572
00:33:02,390 --> 00:33:06,149
if you give a hand in your money I'll be
caught by somebody and webcam

573
00:33:06,149 --> 00:33:10,120
will lose two things wrong with that one
is that you can walk to the oh so the

574
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:11,690
room where there's no webcam

575
00:33:11,690 --> 00:33:14,700
the other is he probably doesn't care I
have a

576
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:19,049
whole sequence of photographs I captured
in Time Square New York where there's a

577
00:33:19,049 --> 00:33:20,019
web camera

578
00:33:20,019 --> 00:33:24,809
watching a complete drug deal happen
like you money the drugs me and over

579
00:33:24,809 --> 00:33:27,850
and they obviously either didn't know
they were on camera when they didn't

580
00:33:27,850 --> 00:33:29,340
care they were on camera

581
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:32,419
and in fact the munis remember the word
earthCam

582
00:33:32,419 --> 00:33:36,720
if you go on Google ad you can find
cameras all over the world no.2

583
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:40,929
stop with his leg jean a government
office in India

584
00:33:40,929 --> 00:33:45,850
he did journalism on this is New York
City is lords in the back there all

585
00:33:45,850 --> 00:33:48,899
those red dot scope there are people who
%uh pistol permits

586
00:33:48,899 --> 00:33:53,120
in Westchester and Rockland County which
are north of New York

587
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:56,409
but ironically a few of them actually
although their permit

588
00:33:56,409 --> 00:34:00,260
is up there they live in the box I used
to live right there

589
00:34:00,260 --> 00:34:03,240
so this is the guy who's like down the
block from where I used to live when I

590
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:04,330
was growing up

591
00:34:04,330 --> 00:34:07,399
and he is in this public database

592
00:34:07,399 --> 00:34:11,520
because he has a permit to carry a gun
and what I did is a

593
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:15,609
obliterated again serves information but
Iran

594
00:34:15,609 --> 00:34:18,810
spoke you on him I didn't even pay
anything

595
00:34:18,810 --> 00:34:22,460
and I got much more information about
him is approximate age

596
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:28,060
the value of this property arm the fact
that he has a post office box and so on

597
00:34:28,060 --> 00:34:31,190
so what's the point of this again it's
dated Jake sawing

598
00:34:31,190 --> 00:34:34,470
just using basic information about him

599
00:34:34,470 --> 00:34:38,679
I got all this stuff I didn't even
better one with spoke you on my son is

600
00:34:38,679 --> 00:34:40,139
26 years old

601
00:34:40,139 --> 00:34:44,629
Iran is email address through it and
call them up and i said i you like

602
00:34:44,629 --> 00:34:46,500
such-and-such a band he said how'd up

603
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:51,000
did you know that I said because you
have a plane that is on your playlist on

604
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,359
last on FM

605
00:34:52,359 --> 00:34:55,839
is and how what did you know I had a
playlist on last.fm

606
00:34:55,839 --> 00:34:59,720
so is because his email address so he
and I now have a

607
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:03,369
on non-proliferation treaty that we
don't attack each other because

608
00:35:03,369 --> 00:35:07,940
he's pretty good hacker do so you find
out things about me

609
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:11,589
arm and there's a whole new trend to

610
00:35:11,589 --> 00:35:15,990
pusher the map first to showing high
crime areas

611
00:35:15,990 --> 00:35:21,339
and this is a particular area in the UK
where 24 crimes reported here

612
00:35:21,339 --> 00:35:24,630
know the funny thing is when you look at
the picture the street it's basically

613
00:35:24,630 --> 00:35:27,490
like unobligated Coronation Street

614
00:35:27,490 --> 00:35:31,050
is basia like a a simple easygoing

615
00:35:31,050 --> 00:35:34,119
you know British treat this gonna Paul
Barnard

616
00:35:34,119 --> 00:35:37,410
apparently the post office workers going
drink there but

617
00:35:37,410 --> 00:35:40,470
it's certainly not a wild and crazy
place but

618
00:35:40,470 --> 00:35:44,190
there happens to be a nightclub around
the corner and so all these

619
00:35:44,190 --> 00:35:49,109
climbs over antisocial behavior or
actually happening tonight bob

620
00:35:49,109 --> 00:35:54,530
blood being tagged to the postal code on
this particular quiet street

621
00:35:54,530 --> 00:35:57,700
why do we care will these people are
complaining that

622
00:35:57,700 --> 00:36:02,190
this crime map official Maplin the from
the British police

623
00:36:02,190 --> 00:36:05,380
is lowering their property values
because people think it's a prime

624
00:36:05,380 --> 00:36:06,270
neighborhood

625
00:36:06,270 --> 00:36:09,730
and there are actually a reports that
say that

626
00:36:09,730 --> 00:36:13,510
crime rates and real estate buyers are
strongly correlated

627
00:36:13,510 --> 00:36:16,820
so we really have the government with
the best intentions

628
00:36:16,820 --> 00:36:20,369
putting out a crime map but doing it not
quite Wade

629
00:36:20,369 --> 00:36:24,170
in causing innocent people's house
prices to go down

630
00:36:24,170 --> 00:36:27,900
gather some indirect mister government
disclosure wanna miss you can get it

631
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:28,570
back

632
00:36:28,570 --> 00:36:32,500
there's a company in Al Florida Georgia
called ChoicePoint systems

633
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:36,109
is now part of LexisNexis the pentagram
everything

634
00:36:36,109 --> 00:36:39,359
so I interviewed one woman and she had

635
00:36:39,359 --> 00:36:43,329
been to a small claims court and nose on
a file

636
00:36:43,329 --> 00:36:46,359
and she said yeah I sue the guy and I
want you know

637
00:36:46,359 --> 00:36:50,290
and she said but it looked bad cuz I
went to small claims court

638
00:36:50,290 --> 00:36:54,540
and she told Lexus and they said we
don't care is it true that you were in

639
00:36:54,540 --> 00:36:55,260
court

640
00:36:55,260 --> 00:36:59,400
well yeah but I want they they didn't
put them in a file they just left it

641
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:03,640
in small claims court you know for for
civil matter

642
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:07,740
another guy even weirder story was
always going for job interviews is

643
00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:09,190
really good engineer

644
00:37:09,190 --> 00:37:12,540
and you get to the final stage in the
interview and then they would hire

645
00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:13,720
somebody else

646
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:17,220
and you spreading she got a friend of
his who was a headhunter

647
00:37:17,220 --> 00:37:20,599
to pull this pilot ChoicePoint in a
French unlike

648
00:37:20,599 --> 00:37:25,250
you know I you her you're convicted
murderer you did 10 years in jail

649
00:37:25,250 --> 00:37:29,540
is I did not that's not me and they had
actually crossed his social security

650
00:37:29,540 --> 00:37:30,640
number

651
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:34,940
or with somebody else was a murderer and
they never told him nobody ever told him

652
00:37:34,940 --> 00:37:36,450
that's waiting get the job

653
00:37:36,450 --> 00:37:40,890
but nobody wanted to hire murder as an
engineer

654
00:37:40,890 --> 00:37:44,800
so database are being cross reference
and there's a whole new thing I wanna go

655
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:46,740
to leave you with a whole new idea which
is

656
00:37:46,740 --> 00:37:50,140
genetic genealogy & how that's gonna
happen

657
00:37:50,140 --> 00:37:53,609
so many be doing your family tree on
Ancestry

658
00:37:53,609 --> 00:37:57,010
ok it was fun I G you put in um

659
00:37:57,010 --> 00:38:01,320
your name and your parents in their data
birth and it goes and tries to chase

660
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:03,099
your family tree in a mature

661
00:38:03,099 --> 00:38:06,579
know for different countries how good it
is but I know that for

662
00:38:06,579 --> 00:38:09,720
the United States right come from its be
very good

663
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:14,220
they have six billion records and $20
million family trees

664
00:38:14,220 --> 00:38:17,760
but their newest thing is they want your
DNA

665
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:20,880
so if you send them your DNA in ninety
nine dollars

666
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:24,510
they will work your ancestry back to
hand him an evil whatever they're really

667
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:28,920
you know carry it back to the beginning
burgers named Richard A&A

668
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:32,210
and you say well you know yeah but they
said they'll be careful

669
00:38:32,210 --> 00:38:36,560
10 my DNA be disclosed without my
consent generally no but

670
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:40,450
there are some limited circumstances
required by law

671
00:38:40,450 --> 00:38:43,520
to weave n Frater cybercrime to enforce

672
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:46,609
our weights the gym about for different
reasons there

673
00:38:46,609 --> 00:38:52,060
why they might give out your DNA so my
advice to be doing have DNA testing done

674
00:38:52,060 --> 00:38:56,150
does really work with them send in in in
the move your dog or your cat or

675
00:38:56,150 --> 00:38:57,500
something like that right

676
00:38:57,500 --> 00:39:01,349
so your dog will have a DNA profile arm

677
00:39:01,349 --> 00:39:06,070
what are the implications oh well DNA in
the genome databases that

678
00:39:06,070 --> 00:39:10,180
sperm donors are suddenly getting phone
calls from their children

679
00:39:10,180 --> 00:39:14,430
saying you know it's time go to college
dad and the guy goes you know my kid

680
00:39:14,430 --> 00:39:19,750
well yes I am I checked you in the DNA
base there is one play group actually

681
00:39:19,750 --> 00:39:24,560
up twenty seven children in New York
City all former have the same spot sperm

682
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:25,680
donor father

683
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:30,550
and they go on vacations together and
they all look alike is ridiculous right

684
00:39:30,550 --> 00:39:33,700
is even a guy who has a truck he dries
rome new york

685
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:37,099
so if you really want to know who your
daddy is you just go when you find his

686
00:39:37,099 --> 00:39:37,849
truck

687
00:39:37,849 --> 00:39:42,170
and you go in game 2 99 delors and he
will tell you who's your daddy

688
00:39:42,170 --> 00:39:45,780
and you can probably see what's coming
next he starting a

689
00:39:45,780 --> 00:39:49,089
reality TV show so there's going to be a
show

690
00:39:49,089 --> 00:39:52,960
are based upon the interesting stuff
that he finds out her

691
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:57,900
10 pages found out he had a couple came
it to kill a married couple command

692
00:39:57,900 --> 00:40:01,609
he did their DNA said I don't know how
to break this to you but you both have

693
00:40:01,609 --> 00:40:03,940
the same father

694
00:40:03,940 --> 00:40:08,099
knew her only a part number thirteen
less one

695
00:40:08,099 --> 00:40:12,359
beware of time traveling robots from the
future Brad templeton

696
00:40:12,359 --> 00:40:15,900
up the Electronic Frontier Foundation
said a long time ago

697
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:19,819
there's a bull call while West 2.0 that
says and well but happen

698
00:40:19,819 --> 00:40:23,460
in the past 10 years it might be online
they have in the past five years

699
00:40:23,460 --> 00:40:25,089
probably online

700
00:40:25,089 --> 00:40:28,290
it happen in past two years it's almost
certainly online

701
00:40:28,290 --> 00:40:31,730
so data that used to be public but
buried

702
00:40:31,730 --> 00:40:35,790
like divorce judgment Center in a file
in the basement of a chord

703
00:40:35,790 --> 00:40:40,140
are now being digitized ChoicePoint
actually sends high school students with

704
00:40:40,140 --> 00:40:41,079
notebooks

705
00:40:41,079 --> 00:40:45,480
to hand write because they can photocopy
them people's divorce judgment

706
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:48,630
to find who got the car who got the dog
and so on

707
00:40:48,630 --> 00:40:51,990
so all kinds a data that

708
00:40:51,990 --> 00:40:56,710
nobody can be cared about before is
being digitized and sucked up

709
00:40:56,710 --> 00:41:00,069
I like to leave people with this image
which is a true add that some

710
00:41:00,069 --> 00:41:04,960
woman ran free to good home beautiful
six month old kitten playful friendly

711
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:10,530
or handsome 32-year-old husband funny
good job doesn't like cats

712
00:41:10,530 --> 00:41:15,270
says he goes when the cat goes call
Jennifer come and see both and thus I

713
00:41:15,270 --> 00:41:17,349
which one you like

714
00:41:17,349 --> 00:41:20,450
why do I show you this so that you're
remembered

715
00:41:20,450 --> 00:41:23,770
the key point which is that we have to
make choices so every time we do

716
00:41:23,770 --> 00:41:24,660
something

717
00:41:24,660 --> 00:41:29,230
whether it's post something on Facebook
or bold for somebody

718
00:41:29,230 --> 00:41:33,099
we're making a choice about what kind
where one limited and the reality is

719
00:41:33,099 --> 00:41:35,119
that most people you now know more than

720
00:41:35,119 --> 00:41:38,520
99.9 percent of the people about this
stuff

721
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:41,660
I've been showing my book and if you
haven't picked one up there's a leaflet

722
00:41:41,660 --> 00:41:42,380
from my book

723
00:41:42,380 --> 00:41:45,470
which comes out later this month if you
order it online though

724
00:41:45,470 --> 00:41:50,520
give you a pre-publication discount love
the stories order in here that I taught

725
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:54,150
told you here or flesh on love more
details on the book

726
00:41:54,150 --> 00:41:58,160
and the book basie concludes that
technology is creeping into everything

727
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:01,450
and we have a responsibility to make
sure that it's done right

728
00:42:01,450 --> 00:42:05,859
nobody wants to to throw stuff away and
should be go for genetic test

729
00:42:05,859 --> 00:42:09,329
and it tells you you know that it might
you might save your life

730
00:42:09,329 --> 00:42:13,339
that's a good thing but if you go for
genetic test and suddenly you can't get

731
00:42:13,339 --> 00:42:14,630
medical insurance

732
00:42:14,630 --> 00:42:17,710
that's a bad thing if you're driving
your car

733
00:42:17,710 --> 00:42:22,349
and there's a century Ned other releases
your air bag that's a good thing

734
00:42:22,349 --> 00:42:27,060
but that center also does a breath
analysis in calls the police on you

735
00:42:27,060 --> 00:42:30,839
maybe that's not such a good day so
anyways bridger the book

736
00:42:30,839 --> 00:42:34,589
that safe I'm you have a little bit I'm
for questions between own booze

737
00:42:34,589 --> 00:42:40,700
thank you very much questions

738
00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:46,520
what would like to ask a question any

739
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:53,220
it's hard to get the first question to
answer the second question

740
00:42:53,220 --> 00:42:56,270
force you can tell so yes your freemen

741
00:42:56,270 --> 00:42:59,980
used like the I'm will you teach with
your course called

742
00:42:59,980 --> 00:43:04,819
Jack what do you teach okay so I for a
long time talk computer science I have

743
00:43:04,819 --> 00:43:06,150
two famous toons

744
00:43:06,150 --> 00:43:10,220
James Gosling who wrote meant in Java
and Colin Jennings

745
00:43:10,220 --> 00:43:14,310
who at the age of 28 sold his company is
cisco freely million dollars

746
00:43:14,310 --> 00:43:17,680
and so those so those are my claim to
fame now what did you say teach

747
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:19,260
environmental design

748
00:43:19,260 --> 00:43:23,180
so i GTG about smart communities in
kinda went to rate please

749
00:43:23,180 --> 00:43:26,819
but I'll sampling graduates who is
working on security he so I'm

750
00:43:26,819 --> 00:43:30,349
join profess between computer science
and environmental design

751
00:43:30,349 --> 00:43:34,359
I was an easy question order one

752
00:43:34,359 --> 00:43:38,390
we just one drink that's OK too

753
00:43:38,390 --> 00:43:42,930
once yes you even left with all session
mother

754
00:43:42,930 --> 00:43:46,359
well much you make me laugh and I don't
know how to phrase this

755
00:43:46,359 --> 00:43:51,109
up this aid these very thin line between
security and privacy

756
00:43:51,109 --> 00:43:54,520
yes what do you think is the right
balance arm you know it's gonna be

757
00:43:54,520 --> 00:43:55,230
personal

758
00:43:55,230 --> 00:43:58,369
I and 10 things is happening is the

759
00:43:58,369 --> 00:44:01,579
younger people are like a lot more
liberal in their privacy rights is an

760
00:44:01,579 --> 00:44:04,599
awful lot of people be at saw on
Facebook that swine

761
00:44:04,599 --> 00:44:08,540
I have a hunch are they going to be a
little bit differently let's say you are

762
00:44:08,540 --> 00:44:12,020
in high school and you're drinking at
the chem lab glassware

763
00:44:12,020 --> 00:44:16,030
and then you get into college and for
some reason in getting to the ivy league

764
00:44:16,030 --> 00:44:17,660
coaching you never know why

765
00:44:17,660 --> 00:44:20,910
well maybe that you know full review
drinking glassware

766
00:44:20,910 --> 00:44:24,210
so they go to some horrible college and
you think well

767
00:44:24,210 --> 00:44:27,940
I'll get a job as a lab tech then the
show your picture in the goal

768
00:44:27,940 --> 00:44:31,900
we're not to let you be a lab tech so
one stupid little thing like that

769
00:44:31,900 --> 00:44:35,200
to haunt you for a long time so your

770
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:39,290
I met a guy he writes had dinner with
him last night who every year

771
00:44:39,290 --> 00:44:43,050
destroys his Facebook profile because
she's afraid that some

772
00:44:43,050 --> 00:44:47,349
good thing you got in there they didn't
want in the recreation under a new name

773
00:44:47,349 --> 00:44:51,720
so I think we're gonna start seeing
people doing kinda really aggressive

774
00:44:51,720 --> 00:44:55,540
things like that having multiple
identities right i mean just like

775
00:44:55,540 --> 00:44:58,920
you should have different emails for
different things so i i think we're

776
00:44:58,920 --> 00:45:00,420
gonna see consumers

777
00:45:00,420 --> 00:45:03,760
getting very savvy about ways to fight
back

778
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:07,599
arm stores are putting in technology
know that follow you

779
00:45:07,599 --> 00:45:12,040
is so you walk into the store and the
pain is from your sis smartphone

780
00:45:12,040 --> 00:45:15,640
well actually tell the store feel kinda
who you are

781
00:45:15,640 --> 00:45:19,680
where you been there before and then
they have cameras that follow you

782
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:23,839
to see what you pick up and so on and
they're building up all these are

783
00:45:23,839 --> 00:45:28,859
profile sues one one case in the US
where guy comes into a Target store

784
00:45:28,859 --> 00:45:33,430
he says is rediculous you send my
daughter ads for baby stuff but she's

785
00:45:33,430 --> 00:45:35,540
only 16 years old

786
00:45:35,540 --> 00:45:38,670
and the headline on this article by the
way was target

787
00:45:38,670 --> 00:45:41,690
lines old girl was pregnant before her
father does

788
00:45:41,690 --> 00:45:45,890
and here's how it worked she went in
there in the certain products that bad

789
00:45:45,890 --> 00:45:49,530
women by when they're pregnant skin
moisturizers though she bought that

790
00:45:49,530 --> 00:45:52,560
stuff didn't even use a credit card use
the debit card

791
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:55,710
but target was tracking your target then

792
00:45:55,710 --> 00:46:00,000
started to send her these ads and the
father freaked out

793
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:03,609
when in and two weeks later came back
and apologized and said

794
00:46:03,609 --> 00:46:07,030
although there were some things going on
in my house I didn't know about

795
00:46:07,030 --> 00:46:10,290
she is pregnant she's due in August so

796
00:46:10,290 --> 00:46:14,050
target this week is really interesting
talking sooo yeah I read

797
00:46:14,050 --> 00:46:17,300
it's creepy to send women ads

798
00:46:17,300 --> 00:46:21,690
that are from baby stop and the public
will use those coupons because we pre

799
00:46:21,690 --> 00:46:22,480
plum out

800
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:26,589
so now what they do is the mix in
lawnmowers and barbecues and other

801
00:46:26,589 --> 00:46:27,240
things

802
00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:31,520
so this still targeting the woman with
baby stop but she looks at you that lawn

803
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:32,630
mower I don't want that

804
00:46:32,630 --> 00:46:36,670
but not there's a baby coupon and the
the money pulled from the

805
00:46:36,670 --> 00:46:40,369
the guy a target was as long as she
doesn't realize that she

806
00:46:40,369 --> 00:46:44,010
it that it had that we're doing that to
her then it's not creepy

807
00:46:44,010 --> 00:46:48,520
right so they just find more and more
sophisticated ways to argue

808
00:46:48,520 --> 00:46:52,599
annual yes I'm back

809
00:46:52,599 --> 00:46:55,920
thank you this

810
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:59,140
as more governments right now are
putting more data online your

811
00:46:59,140 --> 00:47:02,160
and we look at things like city in New
York they've also been looking at you

812
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:05,640
could face huge population the concert
in rich back that data

813
00:47:05,640 --> 00:47:08,839
and so I think when the questions were
looking at from a promise the same point

814
00:47:08,839 --> 00:47:12,619
is as people can uploaded answer to
enrich their government data are you

815
00:47:12,619 --> 00:47:16,119
seeing cases where malicious actors are
coming in is turning to

816
00:47:16,119 --> 00:47:19,930
maybe taint your your reputation by
uploading things that aren't true about

817
00:47:19,930 --> 00:47:20,930
you back in the

818
00:47:20,930 --> 00:47:24,180
yeah it was a seat like fixture in the
on

819
00:47:24,180 --> 00:47:27,920
there's a there's a saying called dirty
dirty phone book Duncombe

820
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:31,640
we can put any 10 digit phone number in
and say whatever you want about it

821
00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:35,260
and it's always for comments about
people so yeah I think there is

822
00:47:35,260 --> 00:47:38,859
definitely their complaint skinny into
the system the 1i heard about

823
00:47:38,859 --> 00:47:43,490
that's very specific is a bunch of
neighbors in Red Deer Alberta

824
00:47:43,490 --> 00:47:47,680
he did this one neighbor and they
started making bogus complaints and see

825
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:48,730
plate fix

826
00:47:48,730 --> 00:47:51,730
so the bylaw officer was always there
you know

827
00:47:51,730 --> 00:47:55,700
all your garbage is blowing in the
backplane but by law officer never found

828
00:47:55,700 --> 00:47:56,530
any garbage

829
00:47:56,530 --> 00:48:00,230
because they were all these bogus things
so when you have these systems

830
00:48:00,230 --> 00:48:04,000
that as you suggested allow citizen in
point that's when you get into a lot of

831
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:05,369
trouble

832
00:48:05,369 --> 00:48:09,220
so yeah Israel

833
00:48:09,220 --> 00:48:13,839
in Stamford range thank you all very
much with one person on whom I climb

834
00:48:13,839 --> 00:48:16,940
he almost lost guy and

835
00:48:16,940 --> 00:48:20,369
in West less question heavy Demi
analyses self

836
00:48:20,369 --> 00:48:25,240
less less democratic open societies all
your examples are from

837
00:48:25,240 --> 00:48:29,339
primarily the US you wanted other a
liking to you or give you one Chinese

838
00:48:29,339 --> 00:48:30,329
example

839
00:48:30,329 --> 00:48:34,140
as I have a whole like the book is not
just about computers is all biology

840
00:48:34,140 --> 00:48:37,470
DNA section arm aids testing

841
00:48:37,470 --> 00:48:40,710
by the World Health Organization
supposed to be anonymous

842
00:48:40,710 --> 00:48:43,900
blood one she s AR in China

843
00:48:43,900 --> 00:48:47,770
has just passed a law that you must
disclose your status

844
00:48:47,770 --> 00:48:51,869
you'll to your spouse know they're so
arm there are countries out there that

845
00:48:51,869 --> 00:48:53,880
have different ideas about information

846
00:48:53,880 --> 00:48:56,930
I guess this report

847
00:48:56,930 --> 00:49:00,500
okay thanks but thank you

848
00:49:00,500 --> 00:49:01,119
thanks to save minutes
