1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:04,290
right welcome everybody my name's again
Wilkinson

2
00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:08,300
and my talk today is entitled the
machines that betrayed them austin's

3
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:12,280
thanks for coming along it's a topic
that I'm quite excited about

4
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:15,670
and Allah ya like to share share the
excitement within

5
00:00:15,670 --> 00:00:18,840
at my office I'm known as the guy with
the toys

6
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:22,560
occurs every second day this apostle
from eBay or Amazon or somewhere

7
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:26,180
with toys in it and apology my toys
along today

8
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:30,269
and I'm as hackers are all lunch a big
kids basically

9
00:00:30,269 --> 00:00:34,489
so update my choice and after the jump
play with MTN

10
00:00:34,489 --> 00:00:41,219
feel free to come in a come and check it
all out so as I said

11
00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:44,570
my name is Glenn that's my twitter
handle if you're interested in such

12
00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:45,230
things

13
00:00:45,230 --> 00:00:48,820
my lucky numbers 11 which is why that
man's rain 11 on a shirt

14
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:52,489
I am originally from a country called a
Zimbabwean

15
00:00:52,489 --> 00:00:57,629
to small landlocked country in Southern
Africa I

16
00:00:57,629 --> 00:01:01,120
studied at the University of Oxford in
England on a Rhodes Scholarship

17
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:04,530
so I have a master's degree from Q could
in computer science from there

18
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:08,400
and I currently work for information
security firm pest

19
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,490
and testing firm called sense burst its

20
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:14,950
I'm a company start in South Africa
about fourteen years ago in fact was of

21
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:16,280
14th birthday this year

22
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:20,080
but I work for the London office which
has been running for for a few years now

23
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:23,150
so my day job is hacking stuff

24
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:26,200
I guess I'm a security analyst or pen
tester all

25
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:29,680
whatever you wanna call it so I get paid
to hack stuff

26
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:34,299
which is your had a dream growing up I
never thought I get paid to hack into

27
00:01:34,299 --> 00:01:36,340
banks and now I do such pretty cool

28
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:39,600
and also spent a lot of time training
search

29
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:43,240
black at Vegas other black cats hack in
the box all that kind of stuff

30
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:48,390
we give training on most continents and
then 2010 to my time as research time

31
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:52,380
so I get to play with toys and income
and speaker conferences Stewart lovely

32
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:53,140
people like you

33
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:57,329
and spoke in a few conferences over last
year

34
00:01:57,329 --> 00:02:00,600
about the STEC and few other interests
that I have

35
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:04,340
but

36
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:09,360
enough about me let's talk about you
does

37
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:13,480
anybody in the audience recognize any of
these addresses

38
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:17,629
or are somebody's photographs maybe it's
a a

39
00:02:17,629 --> 00:02:21,239
your house your friends house a place
you visited

40
00:02:21,239 --> 00:02:26,520
I see we have some addresses and
Amsterdam Germany Italy Turkey

41
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:32,769
now I see there are fewer people here
than there were the keynote when I click

42
00:02:32,769 --> 00:02:33,980
to the state TS today

43
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:38,890
Sui may not get ahead but do let me know
if you see anything of interest in on

44
00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:39,780
from Israel

45
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:43,629
see an ice coffee shop there that's on
may have visited recently and maybe some

46
00:02:43,629 --> 00:02:45,700
state and Continental Hotel

47
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:50,569
and a whole bunch was from states

48
00:02:50,569 --> 00:02:55,849
and recognize the office or the house
songs that the Essex in Chicago

49
00:02:55,849 --> 00:02:58,940
well a mosque England actually telling

50
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:03,250
you have stage are you do you live here
so don't worry about owning up

51
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:08,330
and of course welcome to those of you
who attended

52
00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:11,890
black at Vegas in 2012 good to see some
continuity over the years

53
00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:15,530
and also a black hat he %um so welcome
to those of you who have attended a

54
00:03:15,530 --> 00:03:17,209
conference in the past welcome back

55
00:03:17,209 --> 00:03:22,620
and my sissy people visiting from

56
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:25,720
from all over the world so the people
you're from State Street

57
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:29,489
all over Europe and of course from Asia
and Southeast Asia

58
00:03:29,489 --> 00:03:33,310
sir mice to see a a good spread
avoidance

59
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:37,269
very different for church of course
black at Brazil end of last year

60
00:03:37,269 --> 00:03:42,959
which seems like people visiting from
from the region locally interesting

61
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:46,170
how I know love that while

62
00:03:46,170 --> 00:03:49,200
the topic of the talk something about
machines

63
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:52,900
something about the trail and I'll give
demos

64
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:56,560
a while but I got that information but I
got it

65
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:00,760
legally about the board by passively
listening two devices

66
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:06,569
that you guys are carrying in your
pockets answer something about

67
00:04:06,569 --> 00:04:07,470
surveillance

68
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:11,080
was interesting is that I'm doing

69
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:14,250
some degree of surveillance year and
profiling

70
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:17,579
butts everything I'm discussing his
research done

71
00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:22,540
pre snowed in and I'm a colleague Daniel
capita myself a couple years ago had the

72
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:23,400
idea that

73
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:28,020
maybe governments ans private sector
organizations are spying on us and

74
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:30,139
trying to figure all kinds information
about us

75
00:04:30,139 --> 00:04:34,330
and they have really deep pockets and
really big budgets

76
00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:38,540
and we are curious to see that a fun to
cover shoestring budgets my my research

77
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:39,690
time twenty percent

78
00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:43,150
one day a week effectively no budget

79
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:46,229
open source software your cheap hardware

80
00:04:46,229 --> 00:04:49,680
if we could bolt some degree of
surveillance system

81
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:54,710
to basically make some kind of launch
dragnet type systems not focusing on

82
00:04:54,710 --> 00:04:56,560
individuals initially but

83
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:59,870
ongoing a large group of people say
people at a conference

84
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:04,060
people in a city people in the country
retrieval technology to you

85
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:08,690
I'm surveilled people on that scale

86
00:05:08,690 --> 00:05:11,940
the talk says something about machines
and something about the trail

87
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:15,960
so what are these machines and how they
betray us

88
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:19,639
so machines are Lacetti devices that we
carry

89
00:05:19,639 --> 00:05:23,440
thats have some kind of computing power
and have some kind of wireless

90
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,830
connection

91
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:29,039
may go back five years ten years Navy
had a cell phone but

92
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:32,860
its only collectivity was the cell
network go back much further than that

93
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:36,180
ans may be at a wrist watch or something

94
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:39,400
maybe the crystal emitted some tiny
signal butts

95
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:42,550
effectively you isolated butts

96
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:46,410
these days more and more so with Karen
devices that have some degree of

97
00:05:46,410 --> 00:05:47,520
computing power

98
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:50,669
and also humid signals

99
00:05:50,669 --> 00:05:53,780
um itself only the most common example a
smartphone

100
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:57,639
most Russia carry a smartphone in fact
based on his previous images

101
00:05:57,639 --> 00:06:02,270
I know you guys carry smartphones but
that's not the only example

102
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:07,090
and bank cards these days have a NFC
chips sit near field communication

103
00:06:07,090 --> 00:06:11,340
on London where I live we use the Oyster
card sir travel card

104
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:14,430
um also users in a c-type technology

105
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:18,350
I'm states have noticed thats your
identity cards have some wireless chips

106
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:19,910
inside them

107
00:06:19,910 --> 00:06:24,699
I see is at least one person here
wearing Google glass so good losses

108
00:06:24,699 --> 00:06:28,080
as the the future as we age your your
job losses and your book

109
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:32,389
and you'll watch sunny everything's got
computers and wireless technology

110
00:06:32,389 --> 00:06:36,210
um just kinda strange we think about it

111
00:06:36,210 --> 00:06:40,520
and the thing the Nike symbol there as a
fitness bracelet

112
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:43,639
says Gary popular these days you have
the space you put on your wrist in a

113
00:06:43,639 --> 00:06:45,139
chip you put in your shoes

114
00:06:45,139 --> 00:06:49,580
and a hot meaty stick in HS and all the
stuff one has your activity

115
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:53,090
and all communicates wirelessly you that
your phone or to you

116
00:06:53,090 --> 00:06:58,139
some other devices in transition out
possible sees days have chips in them

117
00:06:58,139 --> 00:07:02,650
on Anna tumors on these devices
essentially have short-range

118
00:07:02,650 --> 00:07:06,789
communication some have long-range
communication but even things like NFC

119
00:07:06,789 --> 00:07:09,910
are sometimes not that short

120
00:07:09,910 --> 00:07:14,099
on the a left does anybody know that
devices

121
00:07:14,099 --> 00:07:18,560
just under the Google glass image

122
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:23,849
to pacemaker well the future is messed
up pace makers have wireless technology

123
00:07:23,849 --> 00:07:29,949
and not some small custom subset actual
wifi

124
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:34,919
Tom yet which is just really we're to
the point is that we all carry devices

125
00:07:34,919 --> 00:07:37,110
you on us or century inside us

126
00:07:37,110 --> 00:07:42,490
that have some computing power and they
use some kind of wireless technology

127
00:07:42,490 --> 00:07:46,110
and what is technology that they use
varies between devices

128
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:49,690
suppress the cell phone has some the
most number of technologies

129
00:07:49,690 --> 00:07:53,919
this image we see it has WiFi Bluetooth
NFC GSM

130
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:57,000
the whole buncha wireless transmitters
and receivers are essentially just

131
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,220
shouting out information now

132
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:04,020
the betrayal comes in when

133
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:07,090
we think a march what the signals are
and Shh

134
00:08:07,090 --> 00:08:10,729
how we can contract with them and what
we can learn from them

135
00:08:10,729 --> 00:08:14,419
so is essentially two things I'm
interested in

136
00:08:14,419 --> 00:08:17,460
one the uniqueness of the signal is
being emitted

137
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:21,919
by one device or a collection of devices

138
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:25,970
if a device be a cell phone or passports
for fitness bracelet

139
00:08:25,970 --> 00:08:30,300
has a meeting some while a single its
unique at least for some period of time

140
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:34,649
then I can uniquely identify if I'm able
to detect that signal

141
00:08:34,649 --> 00:08:37,940
so must come example example as much
success with

142
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:42,519
is wifi solely mobile devices if you've
left your wifi on

143
00:08:42,519 --> 00:08:47,230
unity not actively using it as I say
that I left my wifi on the guy giving a

144
00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:48,450
talk

145
00:08:48,450 --> 00:08:53,140
so if you've left your wifi on your
device is constantly

146
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:56,959
making noise and sending out a unique
Singhal that includes the mac address of

147
00:08:56,959 --> 00:09:00,360
the device essentially it's I can
uniquely identify this device

148
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:04,640
in this room and if I was at a
conference last year

149
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:07,990
and I had the same device I could know
that that device was in this room at

150
00:09:07,990 --> 00:09:11,200
this point in time and in that room at
that point in time

151
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:14,230
and at the airport and this point in
time if I had

152
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:18,890
the ability to detect the device at
those locations

153
00:09:18,890 --> 00:09:23,130
says the first bought a unique signature
thats you let me something like the RFID

154
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:25,000
signature or the mac Address

155
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,310
for a whole bunch of other options butts
generally speaking

156
00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:32,339
some kind of unique signature

157
00:09:32,339 --> 00:09:35,380
what we once I of two that's

158
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:39,050
potentially is some way to get
information about the owner of the

159
00:09:39,050 --> 00:09:41,089
device

160
00:09:41,089 --> 00:09:43,580
and again the way we interact with that
could be a whole bunch of different

161
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:44,560
options

162
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:48,820
look into wifi again when on left your
wifi on

163
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:53,200
your phone is constantly looking for
networks as previously connected to you

164
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:57,089
and maybe there's some money information
in there as we'll see as we go along

165
00:09:57,089 --> 00:10:00,149
office RFID maybe

166
00:10:00,149 --> 00:10:04,660
included in the signal is in a more
unique identify ID number

167
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:07,839
or a or something of that nature

168
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:10,850
arms are just give me a second the seams
the projector

169
00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:14,329
is

170
00:10:14,329 --> 00:10:19,459
not playing nicely with me

171
00:10:19,459 --> 00:10:26,459
yes but a again so you're as I said that
every machine

172
00:10:26,630 --> 00:10:30,190
I pews feels better wasn't

173
00:10:30,190 --> 00:10:33,200
so it doesn't like to

174
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:40,200
okay final just emerged mode as much a
deep resentment

175
00:10:41,450 --> 00:10:45,800
others guess what's lights coming next
so I think the next light will be what

176
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:49,570
so anyway it's a machine solution give
me anything that's

177
00:10:49,570 --> 00:10:53,590
sorry

178
00:10:53,590 --> 00:11:00,590
yes it's merited

179
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:10,050
technology is great and urs so its merit

180
00:11:10,050 --> 00:11:15,800
honest AV guy 800 by 600

181
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:22,800
merited in the budget a so I 1024

182
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:35,990
K will skip the sir

183
00:11:35,990 --> 00:11:39,870
did you ever machine a unique signature
and then the link:

184
00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:44,400
potentially from that device to a human
being and that's what I'm interested in

185
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:47,490
so the devices that you're carrying a
pocket right now in your wrists

186
00:11:47,490 --> 00:11:51,010
can I you need to identify in this room
and they can't figure out who you alway

187
00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:52,660
you live he and tracked with

188
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:56,190
my usual with colleagues or by yourself
or the spouse or something

189
00:11:56,190 --> 00:12:01,080
and mobile phones smartphones a
wonderful like five years ago ten years

190
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:03,430
ago if you wanted to bug somebody else
avail somebody

191
00:12:03,430 --> 00:12:06,910
he had to break into the house install a
camera and the

192
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:09,900
like the smoke detector or something and
put a physical died on the phone

193
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:11,280
Amundson

194
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:14,990
follow them a car these days we all
carry the most sophisticated bugging

195
00:12:14,990 --> 00:12:15,400
device

196
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:18,740
ever created a voluntarily on officer
its

197
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:24,290
Spurs aus got GPS and camera and before
a wireless technologies and photographs

198
00:12:24,290 --> 00:12:26,500
and personal information banking
information

199
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:30,960
and we just voluntarily carry it around
and don't really give a second thought

200
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:35,310
now as I said is a bunch a unique
signatures the 1 I'm

201
00:12:35,310 --> 00:12:38,750
I've had the most success with and I'll
discuss today is um

202
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:44,350
a wifi wireless technology and the ideas
such a device has a unique mac Address

203
00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:48,490
and the way the wifi particle works

204
00:12:48,490 --> 00:12:50,970
as you're sitting here you're not
connected to a wireless network

205
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:52,800
Univision man loves a hard desert

206
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:56,210
your device is constantly sending out a
message

207
00:12:56,210 --> 00:12:59,520
looking for every wireless network its
ever connected to and a stuffed dates

208
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:02,910
back to the comet act Dino Dai zovi back
in 2005

209
00:13:02,910 --> 00:13:06,480
but I still completely relevant not
fixed and in fact

210
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:13,050
more dangerous than a than ever before
see a furnace any of this message

211
00:13:13,050 --> 00:13:16,380
and now I want to link that's unique
signature

212
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:20,520
to a person and the situation approach
that passively

213
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:25,490
actively a passive linking I don't have
any interaction with your device at all

214
00:13:25,490 --> 00:13:28,070
that's what I've been doing over that I
was doing yesterday to get information

215
00:13:28,070 --> 00:13:29,090
on you guys

216
00:13:29,090 --> 00:13:32,750
so your phone is sending a package

217
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:37,300
and is looking for every network every
connected to you looking for BT Home Hub

218
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:40,920
a FE one is looking for Starbucks is
looking for Virgin

219
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:45,360
is looking for his anybody out there so
as you travel the globe it connects to

220
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,560
different wireless networks in different
countries

221
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:51,240
and you've clicked join the network and
you haven't say forget that network of

222
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:53,090
give left your phone is remember that

223
00:13:53,090 --> 00:13:57,890
and its in the room right now shouting
out the names of or those networks

224
00:13:57,890 --> 00:14:03,130
9 mediately I can offer certain things
from that if your phone is looking for

225
00:14:03,130 --> 00:14:04,720
mcdonnell's free WiFi

226
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:08,370
and L budget airlines free wifi

227
00:14:08,370 --> 00:14:12,620
then my know your below a roller if your
phone is looking for

228
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:16,130
and the ritz premier suites and looking
for

229
00:14:16,130 --> 00:14:20,040
British Airways first class lounge yeah
I can come in for that you could have a

230
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:20,800
high roller

231
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:25,110
and sometimes the name of the network
might be immediately obvious

232
00:14:25,110 --> 00:14:28,850
if I see someone looking for Royal Bank
of Scotland corporate

233
00:14:28,850 --> 00:14:33,460
dance on Fri what's RBS someone's
looking for Royal Bank of Scotland

234
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:34,120
corporates

235
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:37,810
and they're looking for Hooters then
immediately week and now I'm

236
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:42,720
draw some conclusions that was
embarrassing them like it once

237
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:48,700
now it's also owns the

238
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:52,590
interesting about the signals and that's
being sent out as your phone is looking

239
00:14:52,590 --> 00:14:53,890
for his wireless networks

240
00:14:53,890 --> 00:14:58,290
is if those networks are sufficiently
unique

241
00:14:58,290 --> 00:15:01,810
then it's possible to use determined the
geolocation

242
00:15:01,810 --> 00:15:06,390
other's networks on who knows what war
driving is

243
00:15:06,390 --> 00:15:10,790
but about a third of the audience is
this

244
00:15:10,790 --> 00:15:15,280
technique that goes way back to 2001 and
the idea is that

245
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:19,690
number one you have to wear ninja outfit
says mean a top corner there's my ninja

246
00:15:19,690 --> 00:15:20,210
outfit

247
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:24,180
and you have some device that has both
GPS capability

248
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:27,300
and WiFi capability and

249
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:30,940
you basically traverse an entire city or
area

250
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:34,400
and every time you see a wireless
network you know the GPS coordinates

251
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:38,860
so there I and a ninja wonder on London
is only for wireless networks in London

252
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:43,440
mavis a few years ago think there's at
least five now and every time I see a

253
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:44,230
wireless network

254
00:15:44,230 --> 00:15:47,540
I know the name and the GPS coordinates
I make a table

255
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:51,980
like in the bottom corner there and
things like Starbucks unlikely to see

256
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:55,810
thousands of times take the planet
probably tens of thousands of times

257
00:15:55,810 --> 00:15:59,400
but if the name is sufficiently unique
then as

258
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:03,730
it's possible that is only you not only
in July case 21 exact location

259
00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:08,380
and a much about in singapore police
thana and UK where I live

260
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:12,360
you have providers like British Telecom
BT and to get the internet at home

261
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:17,190
you get BT Home Hub dash 1234 or
something to some unique name

262
00:16:17,190 --> 00:16:20,430
to the Virgin Media Virgin Media 6 1249

263
00:16:20,430 --> 00:16:24,160
so the name of the provider and then on
the unique identifiers

264
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:27,190
the same with businesses so BT business
hub

265
00:16:27,190 --> 00:16:30,400
and in some unique identifiers

266
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:33,680
so if I can create a list like this and
then

267
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:38,280
I notice that your device is looking for
BT business hub to df1

268
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:42,010
and I have this big table I can then
look up the name of a network that your

269
00:16:42,010 --> 00:16:43,760
device in your pocket is looking for

270
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:47,010
and for that at some point in the past
you've connected to network

271
00:16:47,010 --> 00:16:51,530
in London on the corner of wall street's
and the City Road

272
00:16:51,530 --> 00:16:55,130
it's gonna take a while to do that so
likely this krauss source projects

273
00:16:55,130 --> 00:16:58,750
on the anyone can be patoski can smudge
on data

274
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:03,100
so project dating back to 2001 wiggle so
we'll dotnet

275
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:07,620
or some other guys and they've been I'm
running the sites ya for thirteen years

276
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:08,750
now and they have

277
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:13,370
on order over 100 million observations
and I'm so I run the software I travel I

278
00:17:13,370 --> 00:17:16,179
just checked recommends networks GPS
coordinates

279
00:17:16,179 --> 00:17:20,790
submitted to them and on what that means
is that anybody can then go and pray

280
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:21,990
that database

281
00:17:21,990 --> 00:17:26,020
and essentially figure out

282
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:30,890
where devices are from

283
00:17:30,890 --> 00:17:34,350
said I see so looking for BT Home Hub
and I immediately know

284
00:17:34,350 --> 00:17:37,990
that you're from this address now
interesting anecdote was working on the

285
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:40,040
software that kinda does all the stuff

286
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:44,170
are sitting at a coffee shop an oxo you
a sloth and I myself a running

287
00:17:44,170 --> 00:17:47,480
I was watching the screen and you guys
walk at the coffee shop speaking Arabic

288
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:48,720
to each other

289
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:52,870
and I was watching the screen and I see
two new mobile devices

290
00:17:52,870 --> 00:17:57,050
probing for network I saw 3G located
those networks to small town in saudi

291
00:17:57,050 --> 00:17:58,090
arabia

292
00:17:58,090 --> 00:18:02,280
arsenio watching my screen these guys
were going to get and away from

293
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:05,760
right down to right down to the street
view of their of the house

294
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:12,400
or at least the place where they have
lived more least visited

295
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:16,120
surpassing the link in a signature and
then actively linking

296
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:19,630
so now all interacting with the device
so with WiFi

297
00:18:19,630 --> 00:18:22,770
contract with WiFi of is no technology a

298
00:18:22,770 --> 00:18:25,900
sending signals to the device and
contracting with it either extract

299
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:27,000
information

300
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,690
or get it to perform some action to get
more information about

301
00:18:30,690 --> 00:18:35,020
about the owner noggins an uptick in
your the state's

302
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:39,370
all the way back to 2005 and a ok and
tackle the calmer attack

303
00:18:39,370 --> 00:18:42,580
basically when your device is looking
for

304
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:47,260
I Starbucks or McDonalds free WiFi or
something

305
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:53,520
number one I can get a signal and 2i can
apply say is me Starbucks

306
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:56,970
assault was doing this yes and the
conference was in me but you notice that

307
00:18:56,970 --> 00:18:58,460
the access points popping up

308
00:18:58,460 --> 00:19:02,090
like Starbucks and like Heathrow Airport
wifi

309
00:19:02,090 --> 00:19:04,790
which is always a good indicator that
somebody is messing with this kinda

310
00:19:04,790 --> 00:19:05,640
stuff but

311
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:09,080
wasn't me I did

312
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:12,690
yeah I did try shut down the access
point arm

313
00:19:12,690 --> 00:19:16,300
but the point is that you can respond
and say hey it's me Starbucks connect to

314
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:16,919
me

315
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:20,470
your device will connect and then you'll
be happy browsing he prolly won't even

316
00:19:20,470 --> 00:19:23,020
notice to get a while a symbol popping
up

317
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:26,410
little wifi symbol on but don't get a
prompt

318
00:19:26,410 --> 00:19:30,090
prisoners like when you go home we all
in Starbucks wanted to automatically and

319
00:19:30,090 --> 00:19:32,630
immediately connect

320
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:37,160
and by doing that I can then interceptor
traffic again this is all school stuff

321
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:40,860
plot your session cookies look at your
outlook look at what you're browsing

322
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:45,410
and such ya determine who you offer your
Facebook account your Twitter account to

323
00:19:45,410 --> 00:19:47,100
your email

324
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:51,170
and plot that kind of information now
the sleepy framework

325
00:19:51,170 --> 00:19:55,150
is a tool that's I worked on back in
2012 and I spoke at a conference call

326
00:19:55,150 --> 00:19:58,070
+44 on the London that's desk on London

327
00:19:58,070 --> 00:20:01,900
anna says she released a
proof-of-concept snoopy tool back then

328
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:05,500
but over the last few months have been
working on a new version that's all

329
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:10,570
my sleep I thought if i'd and its
modular and it's a bit more efficient

330
00:20:10,570 --> 00:20:14,580
but what's the framework is its a
distributed

331
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:17,860
tracking profiling and eight
interceptions framework

332
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:21,480
to takes all the ideas if briefly
touched on

333
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:24,480
and is nothing new about any of that as
well known for a long time but a package

334
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:25,320
that together

335
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:29,990
into a nice unified framework that you
can expand on and on

336
00:20:29,990 --> 00:20:34,400
so there's a new particle it comes out
tomorrow called Green 23 place Bluetooth

337
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:37,870
then we can write a Snoopy plugin that
can detect those signals and

338
00:20:37,870 --> 00:20:42,659
dracula signals and populate data
manipulate data

339
00:20:42,659 --> 00:20:45,919
so I said four things there distributed
tracking

340
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:49,169
date interception and profiling
framework

341
00:20:49,169 --> 00:20:53,610
so distributed the idea is that you can
have

342
00:20:53,610 --> 00:20:57,440
on these snoopy devices running on some
small

343
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:02,010
inconspicuous hardware and disabilities
all snippy sensors over a large area

344
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:05,260
so the whole Singapore

345
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:09,260
and you can run the sleepy software on
anything that runs essential NX

346
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:13,120
as the the wireless adapters that you're
interested in

347
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:17,429
so this device yeah is a.m. its appeal
than black

348
00:21:17,429 --> 00:21:21,530
which is sorta so much the Raspberry Pi
has a single board computer

349
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:25,290
and it's going to add on module atop
that has a

350
00:21:25,290 --> 00:21:28,929
3G connectivity and a GPS device

351
00:21:28,929 --> 00:21:31,940
and then a wireless antenna plugged in
here

352
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:35,919
so very small very inconspicuous I can
like it and then leave it lying around

353
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:38,130
somewhere pull a muscle case

354
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:42,020
and the idea in the Witcher unattended
and as you're all interacting here and

355
00:21:42,020 --> 00:21:43,270
walking around in

356
00:21:43,270 --> 00:21:47,190
day in day out this device will be
collecting information and send him back

357
00:21:47,190 --> 00:21:49,150
to central sleepy server

358
00:21:49,150 --> 00:21:52,880
I can drop these devices over say the
whole Singapore thousands of them

359
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:56,240
and as people move around the city these
devices will detect them contract with

360
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:56,780
them

361
00:21:56,780 --> 00:22:00,810
and send the data back to a central
server so that's nice because

362
00:22:00,810 --> 00:22:04,380
existing technology things like the
pineapple at runs

363
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:08,550
on the single device and then Europe put
in the memory card recovery McCoughtry a

364
00:22:08,550 --> 00:22:10,540
laptop open up why a shock

365
00:22:10,540 --> 00:22:14,970
comes as a bit cumbersome so this is my
skirts distributed takes a day to

366
00:22:14,970 --> 00:22:18,290
sends it back to a central server to
distributed

367
00:22:18,290 --> 00:22:22,270
so tracking kind of obvious you have his
blanket of devices

368
00:22:22,270 --> 00:22:26,110
and as people with wireless transmitters
and pockets

369
00:22:26,110 --> 00:22:29,210
walk through the environment we not
together at this location and

370
00:22:29,210 --> 00:22:31,540
dislocations in this location

371
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:35,400
and is gonna GPS device on those
effectively exactly where it is

372
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:38,669
so distributed tracking a date
interception

373
00:22:38,669 --> 00:22:44,310
so as mentioned up depend on technology
using wifi for example

374
00:22:44,310 --> 00:22:48,750
GSM may be set up a femtocell
interceptor traffic

375
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:51,770
pas the traffic and send it back to a
central server

376
00:22:51,770 --> 00:22:54,950
sister collecting data locally I into
such a traffic

377
00:22:54,950 --> 00:22:58,750
and it goes back to central service have
10,000 devices scattered at the whole

378
00:22:58,750 --> 00:22:59,700
Singapore

379
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:02,960
their all intercepting traffic and
sending a rush traffic back to a central

380
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:03,929
server

381
00:23:03,929 --> 00:23:07,240
for examination and visualization and
then

382
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:10,340
profiling so much collecting or traffic
I'm

383
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:13,679
exploring and manipulating the traffic
and work of things like

384
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:16,790
where you live what your Facebook
profile is he a facebook friends of what

385
00:23:16,790 --> 00:23:18,570
Facebook friends you have in common

386
00:23:18,570 --> 00:23:24,110
um your inbox he'd been emailing common
links are people even emailing

387
00:23:24,110 --> 00:23:27,440
so does the kind of before pieces of the
tech and

388
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:31,840
essentially nothing new but putting it
all together into one unified framework

389
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:36,600
and then the next generation Snivy which
is off to 44.com PSE

390
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:40,030
is only one image on the whole cool
images that has Snoopy wearing out

391
00:23:40,030 --> 00:23:41,780
next-generation Star Trek uniform

392
00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:45,350
sus can find another one or draw me one
please let me know

393
00:23:45,350 --> 00:23:48,450
but next-generation sleepy on

394
00:23:48,450 --> 00:23:51,880
essentially all written in Python

395
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:56,390
and you have the main sleepy process
that runs and has a series appliance

396
00:23:56,390 --> 00:23:59,409
soviets wifi a-gps or Bluetooth

397
00:23:59,409 --> 00:24:04,010
or NFC anna says that data to a local
database on the device

398
00:24:04,010 --> 00:24:09,250
and very customizable sequel I told my
sequel or posts kress

399
00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:13,970
synchronizes that data to a central
server but right at that address

400
00:24:13,970 --> 00:24:19,080
and very much a in choose which plugins
want to run

401
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:23,000
and then multiple CB devices all running
sinking data back to server

402
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:26,250
the survey Hindu data exploration a
visualization

403
00:24:26,250 --> 00:24:30,929
you know web interface or via um a tool
called multi good will see a demo of

404
00:24:30,929 --> 00:24:33,540
that a little bit

405
00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:37,310
you can also sync data over different
technologies so these are things are

406
00:24:37,310 --> 00:24:40,370
called CB radios

407
00:24:40,370 --> 00:24:43,980
so sleepy drone have taken the ZigBee
module

408
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:47,450
building click data and see singer Liza
back to you

409
00:24:47,450 --> 00:24:51,550
and a central sleepy device I may be up
to you up to eight kilometers away

410
00:24:51,550 --> 00:24:53,210
depending on ZigBee Radia

411
00:24:53,210 --> 00:24:57,020
so you have a whole bunch of Sleepy
drones the CB radio and in one central

412
00:24:57,020 --> 00:25:00,470
device was a beer a journal centralized
data back to that one

413
00:25:00,470 --> 00:25:05,169
and maybe the middle one up those data
over 3G or something to some other

414
00:25:05,169 --> 00:25:09,550
central server and sing these great
sites this one's tune of tom has ranged

415
00:25:09,550 --> 00:25:13,169
a tiny little antenna the tune of
commenters outside

416
00:25:13,169 --> 00:25:17,440
range and Rose frail current surfing
$300 million apps

417
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:20,030
and then you can create any
configuration you want to have these

418
00:25:20,030 --> 00:25:21,960
devices sinking a busy bee

419
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:26,630
to device over 3G to device over
Ethernet

420
00:25:26,630 --> 00:25:29,750
it's based in my speech distributed um

421
00:25:29,750 --> 00:25:34,550
yeah letter to catch tough and his
illustration of just on

422
00:25:34,550 --> 00:25:38,690
the ability to intercept a mini play
traffic so we have

423
00:25:38,690 --> 00:25:42,260
Avicii too sleepy drones

424
00:25:42,260 --> 00:25:45,300
it's a moscow so you can to drones yeah

425
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:49,090
and a buncha client devices or victims
are told they must use the word victims

426
00:25:49,090 --> 00:25:49,399
a

427
00:25:49,399 --> 00:25:52,450
client sir devices over here that have

428
00:25:52,450 --> 00:25:56,800
I'm in this case associated with WiFi
and the traffic is going

429
00:25:56,800 --> 00:26:00,880
through the drone and then through the
sleepy server

430
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:05,659
effectively I do netting at the server
so I can see the splines exact IP

431
00:26:05,659 --> 00:26:06,179
address

432
00:26:06,179 --> 00:26:09,620
and traffic flowing through the server I
just past the traffic through

433
00:26:09,620 --> 00:26:14,090
a proxy I can pull out things like
cookies and web sites such a visiting

434
00:26:14,090 --> 00:26:18,450
possibly SSL strip to try and defeat as
a cell which works remarkably well

435
00:26:18,450 --> 00:26:19,140
against

436
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:22,760
most sites on and throughout Mandan

437
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:27,010
manned the middle proxy setup rock n
insert arbitrary code

438
00:26:27,010 --> 00:26:31,690
and said Albert G JavaScript for example
change every image to the Java catch

439
00:26:31,690 --> 00:26:35,130
or my favorites is turned every image
upside down

440
00:26:35,130 --> 00:26:38,200
to see the guys in Starbucks no on the
device

441
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:41,560
browsing funny cats and upside down they
turned upside down

442
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:46,840
right earnest of upside down I goes on
like that

443
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:51,360
you for shouldn't do that and then I'm
to be of traffic inspections are pulling

444
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:54,210
out things like PDF documents a white
conversations

445
00:26:54,210 --> 00:26:57,320
and some social media API sits on
browsing Facebook

446
00:26:57,320 --> 00:27:00,370
I'm able to obtain the Facebook the
session or password

447
00:27:00,370 --> 00:27:03,630
I can then gravel their friends and
their friends friends

448
00:27:03,630 --> 00:27:07,149
and things like that a call so here we
see that the geolocation technology

449
00:27:07,149 --> 00:27:09,399
using we'll

450
00:27:09,399 --> 00:27:13,820
apostle slices these joins a fairly dumb
there have so much processing power

451
00:27:13,820 --> 00:27:16,890
as poss on the grunt work to the server
potentially

452
00:27:16,890 --> 00:27:20,480
which heads up internet over there

453
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:23,860
and yeltsin once they've got a whole
bunch of different technologies

454
00:27:23,860 --> 00:27:27,530
so we have the and Nokia N 900 fantastic
cell phone

455
00:27:27,530 --> 00:27:30,770
runs Linux 40 decommissioned but there's
a new project

456
00:27:30,770 --> 00:27:34,159
be the life back into it neo mine 100
project

457
00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:38,100
kind of shit kick-start re goanna I
recommend you go and data that a good

458
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:39,500
use of the device

459
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:42,790
the Raspberry Pi to be over in black
she's a plug

460
00:27:42,790 --> 00:27:47,380
I'm to be learned that my favorite
device so it's stable it can run 10 s

461
00:27:47,380 --> 00:27:51,760
somewhat Cali Lynn X running on here
which is great Asscher pen test box

462
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:56,040
on a small device like this

463
00:27:56,040 --> 00:28:00,110
and yet you can see it come over here
that's a image over there

464
00:28:00,110 --> 00:28:04,980
as got this fantastic GPS and GSM aboard
on top which the prototype which has

465
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:08,929
just been released

466
00:28:08,929 --> 00:28:15,929
and what else can we do well this year
brought my own little friend along today

467
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:20,590
up

468
00:28:20,590 --> 00:28:26,740
so I've got my up by quadcopter and this
is the controller

469
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:29,929
as you can see is watching you guys

470
00:28:29,929 --> 00:28:33,350
so this is the controller for the
quadcopter so I fly from Jess gotta

471
00:28:33,350 --> 00:28:38,490
FPV camera mounted on it answer says I
compile it from here

472
00:28:38,490 --> 00:28:42,780
and that's all well and good but so what

473
00:28:42,780 --> 00:28:48,710
well so what's is that arm I can attach
wanna be sleepy devices to its

474
00:28:48,710 --> 00:28:52,600
and do this kinda surveillance a mobile
fashion

475
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:56,970
so touch device to this and then fly
over a large area all

476
00:28:56,970 --> 00:29:00,820
pursue somebody or arm

477
00:29:00,820 --> 00:29:04,179
any number of possible things like this
is fairly it's very small lightweight

478
00:29:04,179 --> 00:29:05,520
device

479
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:10,420
so the idea is attached to this and I'm
trying to %um size that's not just on

480
00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:11,880
packets is kinda cool yachts

481
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:15,679
a flying hacking machine butts also is
kind of useful

482
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:19,030
so is useful for a few results I one

483
00:29:19,030 --> 00:29:22,390
I can get altitude so I can fly this
device

484
00:29:22,390 --> 00:29:26,200
about 80 meters UNC at you and she
writes butts

485
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:29,660
with the right antenna I'll be able to
detect signals from the ground

486
00:29:29,660 --> 00:29:33,650
so for some area where I'm not able to
plug in devices locally I can attach it

487
00:29:33,650 --> 00:29:34,880
to the flying machine

488
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:38,929
and fly overhead a safe altitude week on
C me or yeah me but I can

489
00:29:38,929 --> 00:29:43,700
share the signals from a device secondly
if it's some kind of physical barrier I

490
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:45,160
can bypass at

491
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:49,160
so big walls or men with guns would also
something

492
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:53,730
can bypass the physical barrier and
collect data from the other side

493
00:29:53,730 --> 00:29:57,179
arm and also it's very fast so if you
won t blankets

494
00:29:57,179 --> 00:30:00,770
whole city very quickly you can just a
nice grid pattern

495
00:30:00,770 --> 00:30:04,760
much cover the whole area collecting
data from everybody down below

496
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:09,150
now this unit's annual March 20 minutes
a better life up to 40 minutes 5

497
00:30:09,150 --> 00:30:14,240
'em get the right kit for its but then
you can also get fixed wing devices are

498
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:17,049
fixing devices you can fly for up to two
hours

499
00:30:17,049 --> 00:30:20,570
said she just jumped a great passion of
anti City and

500
00:30:20,570 --> 00:30:25,450
because everybody from down below and I
can foresee all kinds of

501
00:30:25,450 --> 00:30:29,220
I am things that we could start play
with their

502
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:32,840
sup under sky bills attack some chose
producers

503
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:36,809
and bad users as with most technology
I'm as an example

504
00:30:36,809 --> 00:30:40,580
say there's a rise downtown people are
looting and being very bad

505
00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:43,799
army to fly one is twice as over the
right area

506
00:30:43,799 --> 00:30:47,150
and collect all the unique signatures
from the writers below her to you the

507
00:30:47,150 --> 00:30:47,710
use

508
00:30:47,710 --> 00:30:51,690
and prosecution going forward or choose
profile a figure out who they are where

509
00:30:51,690 --> 00:30:53,260
they live and that kind of thing

510
00:30:53,260 --> 00:30:57,070
so maybe some degree of good depending
on who the government is

511
00:30:57,070 --> 00:31:00,350
but then the same time maybe there's an
oppressive regime

512
00:31:00,350 --> 00:31:03,820
and people have it peaceful protest and
oppressive regime could fly this

513
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:06,809
takeover and figure out who the
protesters are downstairs

514
00:31:06,809 --> 00:31:11,650
Witcher which could be a yeah a bad
start but the idea is that was just the

515
00:31:11,650 --> 00:31:13,700
technology all technology can be used
for

516
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:16,929
for good or for bad

517
00:31:16,929 --> 00:31:20,679
I'm as example has me flying in London
service alert yeah

518
00:31:20,679 --> 00:31:24,160
Park in London and from assaulted you
survive 80 meters

519
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:28,600
and I'm that little tiny speck down in
the car middle left there

520
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:32,830
essentially Picasa check on shared the
device is real time collecting data as I

521
00:31:32,830 --> 00:31:33,710
fly around

522
00:31:33,710 --> 00:31:37,340
from people down on the ground

523
00:31:37,340 --> 00:31:41,110
on people recognize that

524
00:31:41,110 --> 00:31:44,710
yes that's a this though tells us this
morning man it's hot outside

525
00:31:44,710 --> 00:31:48,840
I think an official said in my hotel
room in flyff IFBB from them

526
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:52,960
on the Justice Espana botch Andren 120
meters I think

527
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:56,230
and John can't see it at all bus

528
00:31:56,230 --> 00:32:01,299
going to access the full but you have
the a

529
00:32:01,299 --> 00:32:05,200
directional antenna and a camera and you
know the person of interest up there

530
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:08,419
while can fly up from safe distance and

531
00:32:08,419 --> 00:32:12,150
get a video feed and use a directional
antenna to you

532
00:32:12,150 --> 00:32:16,740
pickup device is that of people on the
pool Davis some King been up there that

533
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:18,580
you want to serve a look at information
on

534
00:32:18,580 --> 00:32:24,640
or just identify that he's at a location
two point in time

535
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:28,970
so other things you can do with the
they're all you not to say we have some

536
00:32:28,970 --> 00:32:32,610
John as John and he's walking around
with those

537
00:32:32,610 --> 00:32:35,710
is this phone always place that whatever
his pocket

538
00:32:35,710 --> 00:32:39,470
and we already know johns signature so
maybe

539
00:32:39,470 --> 00:32:43,179
he was arrested some time ago always
somehow identified who he is

540
00:32:43,179 --> 00:32:47,120
and watters signatures has mac Address
we know is mac Address is

541
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:50,900
his phones in his pocket and he's
somewhere in Singapore I wanna find John

542
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:53,080
Dawson some questions

543
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:57,010
Stauskas how how is not gonna think what
we can do in

544
00:32:57,010 --> 00:33:01,250
into a a a spiral search to launch the
UAV from

545
00:33:01,250 --> 00:33:05,669
some central location good altitude and
slowly circle ouch

546
00:33:05,669 --> 00:33:10,860
the wide wide a pattern until it finds
John based on a signature below

547
00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:14,610
of course %um blanket a very large areas
again have here for drones

548
00:33:14,610 --> 00:33:17,870
or 100 runs have been deployed over a
large area

549
00:33:17,870 --> 00:33:21,460
okay we need to find person X based on
the signature

550
00:33:21,460 --> 00:33:25,660
push button launched runs and they are
all individually do their own secular

551
00:33:25,660 --> 00:33:27,059
such patent for the grid

552
00:33:27,059 --> 00:33:30,640
until one of them identifies the
signature that were looking for

553
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:33,809
so he and the bottom right that one
smashed on John that he calls his

554
00:33:33,809 --> 00:33:34,640
buddies

555
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:38,070
is half I found John and then

556
00:33:38,070 --> 00:33:41,380
Tom we can use potentially trial
iteration

557
00:33:41,380 --> 00:33:44,700
dislikes triangulation which most people
familiar with that term but you probably

558
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:47,120
mean trial at racin when you say
triangulation

559
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:50,120
on so trial iteration works

560
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:54,500
on distances as opposed to angles and
the distance metric in the scenario

561
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:58,850
is on the signal strength of the device
so how many decibels the signal strength

562
00:33:58,850 --> 00:34:00,429
is from this device

563
00:34:00,429 --> 00:34:04,270
and so the idea here is that you have
one Moss the drone say the guy in the

564
00:34:04,270 --> 00:34:05,720
bottom there

565
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:09,780
and the two other drones I a controlled
by him

566
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:13,890
and they will have a GPS device and
because they know they own positions and

567
00:34:13,890 --> 00:34:14,750
the signal strength

568
00:34:14,750 --> 00:34:18,319
of John's device they can work out
exactly GPS for %uh some John

569
00:34:18,319 --> 00:34:21,440
and as he moves around the wonder at the
bottom

570
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:25,080
really is the message the other two to
move them so we can stay and fix

571
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:25,839
position

572
00:34:25,839 --> 00:34:31,410
and wanna to John as he walks around

573
00:34:31,410 --> 00:34:35,520
price enough talking let's have a
democrat

574
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:42,520
a screen resolution is a little bit
funny but let's see how it works

575
00:34:44,129 --> 00:34:48,179
alright see have miss levy drones the
whole happy running collecting data and

576
00:34:48,179 --> 00:34:50,500
send that data back to a central server

577
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:55,359
but data as boring as a text file or
database or something

578
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:59,100
so what I use this tool called a multi
go

579
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:02,890
so I don't write this too I just use
this tool multi owes a fantastic

580
00:35:02,890 --> 00:35:06,160
graphing data visualization engine
completely customizable

581
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:10,380
as a really lovely way to explore data
and is made by South Africans

582
00:35:10,380 --> 00:35:14,930
which on well from my point of view is
excellent

583
00:35:14,930 --> 00:35:19,000
it's what I've done this I just have
written a few I've created a few snoopy

584
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:25,270
entities see how these entities a drop
them onto the matter but yeah

585
00:35:25,270 --> 00:35:29,770
and then against entities you can run a
transform which is just operation

586
00:35:29,770 --> 00:35:34,839
to have this starting point the base of
operations

587
00:35:34,839 --> 00:35:38,970
I can run the chancel missus fetch
drones others fetches

588
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:42,700
I you can customize what date you want
to slept but I'm JF

589
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:47,390
on side you have time metrics so it got
attached runs so active today

590
00:35:47,390 --> 00:35:50,870
with overactive loss Tuesday whether
active a year ago

591
00:35:50,870 --> 00:35:55,020
defaults to fetch hold runs at an urban
active services including historical

592
00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:57,630
data

593
00:35:57,630 --> 00:36:02,510
so during the last year and a half I run
all these drones

594
00:36:02,510 --> 00:36:05,750
um on my and 900 on my laptop on

595
00:36:05,750 --> 00:36:11,260
I am the BeagleBone on the BeagleBone
attach the flying machine

596
00:36:11,260 --> 00:36:14,280
and when you run it you can specify the
location that you're at

597
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:18,299
southern running this at security
conferences for the last year and a half

598
00:36:18,299 --> 00:36:21,770
a given mines all broadcast traffic so I
haven't done anything

599
00:36:21,770 --> 00:36:25,970
illegal police in these countries its
broadcast on a trip to traffic that your

600
00:36:25,970 --> 00:36:28,980
phone is shouting out to the world

601
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:33,060
so in poland assert 44.com two years in
a row black at various security and

602
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:36,460
Scotland black at his old like at
Singapore's you guys

603
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:39,710
be sized ESCON decade he you I T Webb

604
00:36:39,710 --> 00:36:44,310
and South Africa's our nights and Moscow
in Russia always converse up and running

605
00:36:44,310 --> 00:36:45,470
this

606
00:36:45,470 --> 00:36:49,870
while this is crap you guys she has
black at Singapore

607
00:36:49,870 --> 00:36:54,990
Acura transform fetch clients

608
00:36:54,990 --> 00:37:00,150
pays you guys we've got to turn the wifi
off

609
00:37:00,150 --> 00:37:05,950
so these are all of your devices laptops
tablets mobile phones

610
00:37:05,950 --> 00:37:09,870
and based on the mac address of the
device because we just look at wifi

611
00:37:09,870 --> 00:37:15,230
at the stage we can see that's on this
device is a Samsung device based on the

612
00:37:15,230 --> 00:37:17,150
first haha the mac address

613
00:37:17,150 --> 00:37:22,260
Apple device HTC Apple Inc cetera to
conceal love you guys

614
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:26,450
a good live demos always interesting
it's you can find something cool

615
00:37:26,450 --> 00:37:30,160
describe a subset hope you guys down
there

616
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:37,160
analysts say Fitch societies

617
00:37:42,540 --> 00:37:46,910
now if it comes back with no SSID is
that just major device was in a

618
00:37:46,910 --> 00:37:48,040
broadcast message

619
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:55,040
are any wireless networks out there
little brown blips down there now the

620
00:37:55,220 --> 00:37:57,160
networks that these devices are looking
for

621
00:37:57,160 --> 00:38:00,980
so mag mag more fierce Logitech

622
00:38:00,980 --> 00:38:07,760
don't touch this one's pretty noisy it's
a whole bunch devices there

623
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:10,910
blah what's interesting is when you see

624
00:38:10,910 --> 00:38:14,260
so this device i guess its a shares in
it and when you see

625
00:38:14,260 --> 00:38:17,810
multiple devices looking for the same
network that sometimes interesting

626
00:38:17,810 --> 00:38:20,940
so may remain at may not get a result a

627
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:25,040
but often you might see five devices
looking for

628
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:28,700
RBS which is World Bank of Scotland they
know there's employees here from the

629
00:38:28,700 --> 00:38:29,730
World Bank Scotland

630
00:38:29,730 --> 00:38:32,740
I guess that's cool

631
00:38:32,740 --> 00:38:35,770
let's grab just priceless kinda noisy

632
00:38:35,770 --> 00:38:39,869
let's grab those wireless networks

633
00:38:39,869 --> 00:38:45,910
can say fetch locations what that does
it craze the wheel website

634
00:38:45,910 --> 00:38:49,760
now we'll doesn't have an API I am

635
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:52,869
which means you have to do page scraping

636
00:38:52,869 --> 00:38:56,070
no results come back that could mean
that's

637
00:38:56,070 --> 00:38:59,140
om you the they weren't

638
00:38:59,140 --> 00:39:04,920
in there that's just wrong I screw a

639
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:11,920
that one

640
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:28,680
scrap a few more

641
00:39:32,130 --> 00:39:36,820
so usually when you see fairly unique
met with names

642
00:39:36,820 --> 00:39:43,820
you'd expect to get ahead swipe

643
00:39:46,140 --> 00:39:50,300
head earlier so he has a device until
device

644
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:54,280
was looking for rapid7 and

645
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:57,630
carey ft located at either to you arm

646
00:39:57,630 --> 00:40:01,550
yes the United States assume somewhere
in russia

647
00:40:01,550 --> 00:40:06,780
and a much or Thursday so I guess rapid
seven maybe has offices in those

648
00:40:06,780 --> 00:40:07,770
locations

649
00:40:07,770 --> 00:40:11,440
double check that the industry P
photograph so

650
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:14,640
the best the office there and shock at
the

651
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:18,280
address and I yup link to Google Maps

652
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:25,280
join to view 10 relapse or something
these guys come back with anything

653
00:40:25,700 --> 00:40:29,230
yes there's one good hit so this device
year

654
00:40:29,230 --> 00:40:32,690
106 whatever 2g located the state's

655
00:40:32,690 --> 00:40:37,060
abortion no Google maps image of their
place it seems

656
00:40:37,060 --> 00:40:40,980
but we get the full address so is this J
saw no way

657
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:46,710
a Nevada so saundra Nevada again so
that's

658
00:40:46,710 --> 00:40:50,400
interesting what else can we do so we
can potentially

659
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:53,820
the phone to see overlap between
different conferences let's grab

660
00:40:53,820 --> 00:40:57,590
two locations to be size London

661
00:40:57,590 --> 00:41:01,810
and black at EU let's see if anybody
here was opposed to those events

662
00:41:01,810 --> 00:41:05,900
just turn up number results all the way
up to the maximum

663
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:09,960
to integrate both of those and say Fitch
clients

664
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:16,770
and that's receive these three devices

665
00:41:16,770 --> 00:41:21,220
work both those conferences there that
maybe grab just those devices

666
00:41:21,220 --> 00:41:25,470
computing you cross and then try and
figure out

667
00:41:25,470 --> 00:41:29,370
more but just those guys so Fitch
societies

668
00:41:29,370 --> 00:41:33,770
so the supreme IT devices there

669
00:41:33,770 --> 00:41:38,330
and maybe we can

670
00:41:38,330 --> 00:41:42,610
good authors okay

671
00:41:42,610 --> 00:41:46,570
what else can we do cemented I mentioned
date interception

672
00:41:46,570 --> 00:41:50,910
so I can create second set up to run a
rogue access points

673
00:41:50,910 --> 00:41:54,340
and then connect to its or convince your
devices to connect to it

674
00:41:54,340 --> 00:41:58,240
hopes that you got it so that you
locates to

675
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:05,040
which is not a good hit Sophie go across
the swindle

676
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:08,690
so this is new be software this is
running

677
00:42:08,690 --> 00:42:12,920
on my laptop at the moment and I'm gonna
run its and I'm gonna say

678
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:19,920
bring up a Road access point and then to
my phone to connect to it

679
00:42:20,030 --> 00:42:23,660
and

680
00:42:23,660 --> 00:42:27,990
course

681
00:42:27,990 --> 00:42:33,280
stopped working was talking to you guys
alright

682
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:36,510
much jus running out before the break
and

683
00:42:36,510 --> 00:42:43,510
we look at its witchcraft was it

684
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:47,500
action I can do slightly differently

685
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:50,850
again some say the stem a so here's a
photograph

686
00:42:50,850 --> 00:42:55,470
and the photograph all the sense post
offices in South Africa

687
00:42:55,470 --> 00:43:00,830
an expert and thats a be released this
photograph is me and all my colleagues

688
00:43:00,830 --> 00:43:02,540
we had a hackathon this past week

689
00:43:02,540 --> 00:43:08,180
so I can do this photograph I can't get
access to information from the

690
00:43:08,180 --> 00:43:08,770
photograph

691
00:43:08,770 --> 00:43:12,700
by racking up right click on it and say
get accept data

692
00:43:12,700 --> 00:43:16,510
that's a kinda meta data could be I am

693
00:43:16,510 --> 00:43:20,760
location information or the type of
camera using the kind of thing

694
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:24,350
and it seems what's we actually and be
accidentally or intentionally geotagged

695
00:43:24,350 --> 00:43:25,160
that photograph

696
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:28,500
so no way that photograph was taken to
mean a related to sense burst

697
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:32,450
I can then I have a transform ya

698
00:43:32,450 --> 00:43:36,600
to query or access points that are
around that location

699
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:40,280
some GPS coordinates somewhere in the
world

700
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:43,840
and donde se fetch from the wheel
database

701
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:47,920
all access points that all within a five
hundred meter radius

702
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:53,520
of on all that address so this is not a
dive collected this is

703
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:57,180
data in the wheel database all of these
access points are around

704
00:43:57,180 --> 00:44:02,340
thats %uh that location I can then go
through all my historical data from all

705
00:44:02,340 --> 00:44:03,930
the conferences I've been to you

706
00:44:03,930 --> 00:44:06,970
and see if I've been to any event

707
00:44:06,970 --> 00:44:10,310
where device I observed at that event

708
00:44:10,310 --> 00:44:13,740
was looking for a wireless network
within 500 meters

709
00:44:13,740 --> 00:44:19,100
all this address which I suspect is the
sense post office

710
00:44:19,100 --> 00:44:22,550
alternatively I testers with some other
companies year second find the address

711
00:44:22,550 --> 00:44:23,900
of Kuala say

712
00:44:23,900 --> 00:44:27,710
plug it in and check your starchic data
and see if anyone cares a Kuala sport

713
00:44:27,710 --> 00:44:28,010
any

714
00:44:28,010 --> 00:44:31,300
prior event I've been to in but I find
it

715
00:44:31,300 --> 00:44:34,490
consents posts I don't get beat up
afterwards

716
00:44:34,490 --> 00:44:38,500
Search app you see these devices yeah
are looking for

717
00:44:38,500 --> 00:44:41,670
a double and AP not that interesting
Whiteford

718
00:44:41,670 --> 00:44:45,150
may be more interesting links us links
us so given

719
00:44:45,150 --> 00:44:48,720
this name is quite unique so that means
is that

720
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:52,640
these six devices here

721
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:56,420
at some conference in my massive
database we're looking for a network

722
00:44:56,420 --> 00:44:57,870
within 500 meters

723
00:44:57,870 --> 00:45:01,830
of the sense post office such as grab
those devices

724
00:45:01,830 --> 00:45:06,750
copy them to new graph

725
00:45:06,750 --> 00:45:12,060
and lets 'em Fitch location swat
locations with his device observed at

726
00:45:12,060 --> 00:45:17,060
sup served at b-side securitate I to
absolute most conferences actually so's

727
00:45:17,060 --> 00:45:21,000
probably is sense most people and then
we can just check what networks are

728
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:22,360
looking for

729
00:45:22,360 --> 00:45:28,460
so but nato to these guys looking for

730
00:45:28,460 --> 00:45:32,480
noisy devices that seems bad cents per
cent lawyers and we start to see stuff

731
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:33,140
like

732
00:45:33,140 --> 00:45:37,640
so I added a bit extra data just to you

733
00:45:37,640 --> 00:45:41,640
highlight the point but if we see stuff
like

734
00:45:41,640 --> 00:45:44,550
picky eater though some so no Zack a
conference

735
00:45:44,550 --> 00:45:48,490
on desk on

736
00:45:48,490 --> 00:45:53,029
um so

737
00:45:53,029 --> 00:45:56,059
because we see unnamed networks that
appear

738
00:45:56,059 --> 00:45:59,690
to be in a security-related that's
probably cents per cent Louise

739
00:45:59,690 --> 00:46:04,190
soul what do I do that I know that I
figured out where sense posts officers

740
00:46:04,190 --> 00:46:04,700
are

741
00:46:04,700 --> 00:46:08,970
so good into the street address but I
had a photograph your Texas data

742
00:46:08,970 --> 00:46:12,559
fidel the GPS coordinates of the Census
Office looked

743
00:46:12,559 --> 00:46:16,440
for all networks around that area within
500 meters

744
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:19,910
of that office so he went to South
Africa went to office with see these

745
00:46:19,910 --> 00:46:20,579
networks

746
00:46:20,579 --> 00:46:24,420
and then all those networks a check my
historical data to see if I'd ever

747
00:46:24,420 --> 00:46:27,539
observed any client devices that were
looking for those devices

748
00:46:27,539 --> 00:46:31,650
and I found six devices looking for
network within 500 meters above the

749
00:46:31,650 --> 00:46:32,680
sense post office

750
00:46:32,680 --> 00:46:36,990
and I see these devices are looking for
networks like a key to her the song and

751
00:46:36,990 --> 00:46:37,900
white desk on

752
00:46:37,900 --> 00:46:42,750
and for in network names like this store
daily unique

753
00:46:42,750 --> 00:46:46,910
there that national geo locates on this
one to two possible addresses

754
00:46:46,910 --> 00:46:50,549
another double check that might give my
address such

755
00:46:50,549 --> 00:46:53,920
potentially you very quickly figure out
the address

756
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:58,289
of all the home address sense first
employees I tried out against a few

757
00:46:58,289 --> 00:46:59,240
other companies year

758
00:46:59,240 --> 00:47:04,109
and it does work pretty well birch arm I
don't want to get into a

759
00:47:04,109 --> 00:47:07,579
into trouble what else can we do some
mention the rogue access point

760
00:47:07,579 --> 00:47:11,529
solicits grab these devices and copy to
neuter of

761
00:47:11,529 --> 00:47:15,069
and sales running the road access point
I want

762
00:47:15,069 --> 00:47:21,450
Sep data from you I'm from these guys so
I intentionally do this to myself so I

763
00:47:21,450 --> 00:47:22,740
don't usually I do indeed

764
00:47:22,740 --> 00:47:26,859
inception he dies and there I see this
Apple device which is my phone

765
00:47:26,859 --> 00:47:30,339
was browsing these two web sites whilst
I'm

766
00:47:30,339 --> 00:47:33,880
tricked into associate into my phone so
them by freaks

767
00:47:33,880 --> 00:47:37,579
and Rubicon project sows browsing them
by freaks dot com

768
00:47:37,579 --> 00:47:41,279
and then grab the cookies so they're
eager

769
00:47:41,279 --> 00:47:44,650
there's the a session cookie for on

770
00:47:44,650 --> 00:47:49,390
this device that was browsing user name
Jimmy 911

771
00:47:49,390 --> 00:47:52,609
say a actively intercept data

772
00:47:52,609 --> 00:47:56,279
from devices and

773
00:47:56,279 --> 00:47:59,420
one final demo just put all that
together

774
00:47:59,420 --> 00:48:03,359
it was nice with multi ok is you can run
what's called a machine

775
00:48:03,359 --> 00:48:07,460
which is running multiple transforms at
once see i've base of operations

776
00:48:07,460 --> 00:48:11,170
I can do a whole bunch of transform
simultaneously

777
00:48:11,170 --> 00:48:14,339
not this is going to be a its gonna
fetch

778
00:48:14,339 --> 00:48:17,519
um fetch all active drones

779
00:48:17,519 --> 00:48:21,460
its then going to you get a location
above all as active drones

780
00:48:21,460 --> 00:48:24,460
get all clients that we're within those
areas

781
00:48:24,460 --> 00:48:29,579
its then going to you look for

782
00:48:29,579 --> 00:48:35,460
arms some commonality is a look for
devices are observed on multiple

783
00:48:35,460 --> 00:48:36,349
occasions

784
00:48:36,349 --> 00:48:39,359
to preserve at the airport and at
Starbucks

785
00:48:39,359 --> 00:48:44,430
and at the hotel grab those devices and
then it's going to you

786
00:48:44,430 --> 00:48:47,950
bring up early a go through historical
date of the rogue access points

787
00:48:47,950 --> 00:48:51,019
and see if a any date was being browsed

788
00:48:51,019 --> 00:48:54,559
and then it's going to I

789
00:48:54,559 --> 00:48:57,569
yeah grab Facebook friends and arm

790
00:48:57,569 --> 00:49:01,180
potentially facebook inbox by one show
that and

791
00:49:01,180 --> 00:49:04,390
the end result running a bit slower but
the end result

792
00:49:04,390 --> 00:49:11,390
is the slide here and psychic one button
Canada's all these operations in one go

793
00:49:11,609 --> 00:49:15,970
and finds that is a device at Heathrow
Airport country Park Hyde Park and

794
00:49:15,970 --> 00:49:16,890
Starbucks

795
00:49:16,890 --> 00:49:21,009
and these devices the BlackBerry the
Apple HTC hopes up to those devices

796
00:49:21,009 --> 00:49:24,269
looking for these networks agency guess
the Verizon

797
00:49:24,269 --> 00:49:27,650
which would you like cater to you San
Francisco and Arab Emirates

798
00:49:27,650 --> 00:49:30,910
candidate interception by bring up a
rogue access point

799
00:49:30,910 --> 00:49:34,480
the guys browsing Facebook source told a
facebook um

800
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:39,500
session and mash good friends list and
we see those two guys Jim Anderson and

801
00:49:39,500 --> 00:49:40,359
Charles Smith

802
00:49:40,359 --> 00:49:47,359
have those three friends in common so
marty was really nice for exploring data

803
00:49:47,539 --> 00:49:50,980
I'm has another graph of people have
attended up

804
00:49:50,980 --> 00:49:53,579
all the conference i've been tempting
see all the overlap between the

805
00:49:53,579 --> 00:49:54,640
different const their

806
00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:58,329
sublet Apple device has been to 44 con

807
00:49:58,329 --> 00:50:01,730
and to you well but 44 cons and black at

808
00:50:01,730 --> 00:50:05,099
2012 on yeah

809
00:50:05,099 --> 00:50:09,039
so it's nice for visualizing data like
that this them I showed you figure out

810
00:50:09,039 --> 00:50:10,569
the cents per cent Louise

811
00:50:10,569 --> 00:50:14,920
jus experiment I did sitting in King's
Cross Train Station in London for 12

812
00:50:14,920 --> 00:50:19,210
about 12 hours and should the graft
number of unique device is observed

813
00:50:19,210 --> 00:50:19,930
overtime

814
00:50:19,930 --> 00:50:25,640
so the nom yup big spike other breakfast
small spike over lunch big spike in the

815
00:50:25,640 --> 00:50:26,180
evening

816
00:50:26,180 --> 00:50:31,009
so just looking at a at a macro level
there and the ratio device observed

817
00:50:31,009 --> 00:50:35,500
so this is from all the conferences so
77,000 devices love observed

818
00:50:35,500 --> 00:50:38,819
and a BH other Apple so over
three-quarters Apple

819
00:50:38,819 --> 00:50:42,039
then HTC and Samsung and then

820
00:50:42,039 --> 00:50:45,500
going down sexy how popular at Lowes
there

821
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:48,539
but just la raza conversion stuff been
deployed and

822
00:50:48,539 --> 00:50:53,240
so I mention the UAV sliding over I
Namibia right area some things a degree

823
00:50:53,240 --> 00:50:54,470
of law enforcement

824
00:50:54,470 --> 00:50:58,220
or bad stuff peaceful protesters

825
00:50:58,220 --> 00:51:03,410
another example let's say you want to
droughts the identity of a celebrity in

826
00:51:03,410 --> 00:51:07,279
so I noticed some Jeff Moss founder
black at his he's in the back in the

827
00:51:07,279 --> 00:51:07,890
room

828
00:51:07,890 --> 00:51:12,329
so if I know he's yeah and I'm running
my sleepy drone his play on its fun

829
00:51:12,329 --> 00:51:16,039
I know she was at another black hat
conference a Brazil act like data from

830
00:51:16,039 --> 00:51:17,029
that conference

831
00:51:17,029 --> 00:51:20,750
that I know is that some charity events
I go to that event I keep

832
00:51:20,750 --> 00:51:24,230
going to events like and physically know
he's at as like a car relational all

833
00:51:24,230 --> 00:51:26,150
those different events and he's

834
00:51:26,150 --> 00:51:29,450
I I C one device be observed all those
different events

835
00:51:29,450 --> 00:51:32,940
that I know that that device is most
likely Jess

836
00:51:32,940 --> 00:51:37,470
and I want to identify term then I can
produce a more active attacks to try and

837
00:51:37,470 --> 00:51:40,960
I get information offered his device
doesn't love

838
00:51:40,960 --> 00:51:45,069
other stars was taken actively being
used so you may not know but most

839
00:51:45,069 --> 00:51:46,000
shopping malls

840
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:49,339
have the stuff running already has an
retail for example is companies like pot

841
00:51:49,339 --> 00:51:51,529
intelligence and Euclid analytics

842
00:51:51,529 --> 00:51:56,009
and a tracking devices they use the same
take as a WiFi Bluetooth NFC always

843
00:51:56,009 --> 00:51:57,029
kinda stuff

844
00:51:57,029 --> 00:52:00,180
also use cameras and audio and stuff

845
00:52:00,180 --> 00:52:03,359
the military's also using it so messed
line and parent

846
00:52:03,359 --> 00:52:06,849
they have this exact technologies do
exactly are described here

847
00:52:06,849 --> 00:52:10,940
differences brother these cost lots of
money on the stuffs open source and free

848
00:52:10,940 --> 00:52:12,069
and

849
00:52:12,069 --> 00:52:15,789
off-the-shelf hardware

850
00:52:15,789 --> 00:52:20,009
are Obama's image which I thought was
cute answer I'm flying drones yeah

851
00:52:20,009 --> 00:52:24,779
idea drone Survival Guide p.m. somehow
survived runs go to the end runs wild I

852
00:52:24,779 --> 00:52:27,170
dot org

853
00:52:27,170 --> 00:52:31,609
ok picture of here on conference I
attended NC number of device allows a

854
00:52:31,609 --> 00:52:34,799
I've observed races number of attendees

855
00:52:34,799 --> 00:52:38,029
a match on and devices per person which
is very rough

856
00:52:38,029 --> 00:52:41,829
so Black Cats shove observe 398 devices

857
00:52:41,829 --> 00:52:45,680
510 these so the

858
00:52:45,680 --> 00:52:49,739
yeah quite large but I'm sure I'm come
in all the areas it's just running on

859
00:52:49,739 --> 00:52:54,049
the small device yesterday for a few
hours

860
00:52:54,049 --> 00:52:57,049
and yeah I think that gives me about

861
00:52:57,049 --> 00:53:00,049
three minutes for questions I'm not
mistaken

862
00:53:00,049 --> 00:53:02,549
burt's yep thanks very much for your
time and let me know if you have any

863
00:53:02,549 --> 00:53:09,520
questions

864
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:14,069
yes

865
00:53:14,069 --> 00:53:18,920
dip the question so how can you defend
yourself has all been about attack

866
00:53:18,920 --> 00:53:23,239
so can you stop your smartphone use the
WiFi site from being so noisy

867
00:53:23,239 --> 00:53:26,859
another it seems that the latest I O S

868
00:53:26,859 --> 00:53:31,230
so I was the most recent release it
seems that day stop the two-degree

869
00:53:31,230 --> 00:53:36,029
um I've had various test sometimes says
mostly cause much more quiet

870
00:53:36,029 --> 00:53:39,829
but Android Windows all the others their
store just as noisy

871
00:53:39,829 --> 00:53:43,239
safety options turn off your wifi we not
at home or

872
00:53:43,239 --> 00:53:47,410
she a network lists sohn on me Apple
products is only one option

873
00:53:47,410 --> 00:53:51,680
delete all networks not a convenient
butts Android and Windows budget

874
00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:53,049
selectively remove

875
00:53:53,049 --> 00:53:56,779
so should keep the so you should ideally
for delete those

876
00:53:56,779 --> 00:53:59,869
to delete ones that are over networks a
Starbucks

877
00:53:59,869 --> 00:54:03,069
that'll stop the road a p-type attack
because that only works against open

878
00:54:03,069 --> 00:54:04,099
networks

879
00:54:04,099 --> 00:54:07,750
but them also you may not I guess
convenient when you go home chill BT

880
00:54:07,750 --> 00:54:10,200
Home Hub 23 42 automatically connect

881
00:54:10,200 --> 00:54:13,319
which Mike the shot your home address to
the world

882
00:54:13,319 --> 00:54:16,710
which to en route to a Packers might not
be a good idea

883
00:54:16,710 --> 00:54:20,319
so it might be a good idea to name name
your home network something a little

884
00:54:20,319 --> 00:54:20,980
bits

885
00:54:20,980 --> 00:54:25,619
some more common yep

886
00:54:25,619 --> 00:54:28,859
the other problem there's this other
problems their butts that better a good

887
00:54:28,859 --> 00:54:35,859
idea

888
00:54:38,710 --> 00:54:39,250
planting

889
00:54:39,250 --> 00:54:42,910
SSID is that allow me to track users and

890
00:54:42,910 --> 00:54:49,290
in up

891
00:54:49,290 --> 00:54:51,060
alright yep

892
00:54:51,060 --> 00:54:55,900
yes good idea site I can offer a I could
bring up a no one access point called

893
00:54:55,900 --> 00:55:00,110
something slightly unique internet for
45 and someone to voluntarily connects

894
00:55:00,110 --> 00:55:00,620
to it

895
00:55:00,620 --> 00:55:04,020
then going for the future I see someone
looking flat SSID

896
00:55:04,020 --> 00:55:07,220
that I know that's a previous divisive
contracted with

897
00:55:07,220 --> 00:55:10,610
assess that's a good idea and icing with
a new sleepy framework is very modular

898
00:55:10,610 --> 00:55:12,830
sit at the counter functionality quite
easily

899
00:55:12,830 --> 00:55:16,040
a any more questions

900
00:55:16,040 --> 00:55:20,510
yeah at

901
00:55:20,510 --> 00:55:23,560
good question where do you draw the
ethical boundary arm

902
00:55:23,560 --> 00:55:27,040
so as security researchers

903
00:55:27,040 --> 00:55:31,940
I think our main role is to look for
weaknesses an existing systems

904
00:55:31,940 --> 00:55:37,130
and shot them out to the world and that
other in the deaths of security in this

905
00:55:37,130 --> 00:55:38,010
useful word

906
00:55:38,010 --> 00:55:41,680
that's why systems like Scott I love
very their sofa love holes because

907
00:55:41,680 --> 00:55:43,130
they've been hidden from hackers

908
00:55:43,130 --> 00:55:47,150
and sorry bout you must hide matters cuz
has a bad the by not doing that they

909
00:55:47,150 --> 00:55:47,840
haven't been

910
00:55:47,840 --> 00:55:51,210
attacked by hackers and therefore the
defenders haven't had to use a great

911
00:55:51,210 --> 00:55:52,090
defenses

912
00:55:52,090 --> 00:55:55,920
so what I hope to get from this project
because I'm release miss

913
00:55:55,920 --> 00:55:58,950
I'm releasing the source code I speak at
conferences are saying look at all those

914
00:55:58,950 --> 00:56:00,450
terrible stuff like Indy

915
00:56:00,450 --> 00:56:03,870
but now you're all aware the terrible
stuff I can do that other

916
00:56:03,870 --> 00:56:08,870
military organizations and retails
already doing so I'm hoping that I'm

917
00:56:08,870 --> 00:56:12,540
may be on the moral high ground chia
because

918
00:56:12,540 --> 00:56:17,270
I am demonstrating Hall are dangers that
says and now maybe Apple and

919
00:56:17,270 --> 00:56:20,860
good luck what models a maybe this is a
bad idea to be giving away so much

920
00:56:20,860 --> 00:56:22,850
information as we should update of stuff

921
00:56:22,850 --> 00:56:26,210
on so %uh I guess I don't think about it
too much

922
00:56:26,210 --> 00:56:28,970
as a security researcher I'm
demonstrating there are weaknesses I

923
00:56:28,970 --> 00:56:30,690
hope by demonstrating his weaknesses

924
00:56:30,690 --> 00:56:33,730
people make this stuff more secure

925
00:56:33,730 --> 00:56:40,730
a yeah

926
00:56:49,109 --> 00:56:51,810
so if you physically compromiser device

927
00:56:51,810 --> 00:56:54,920
can you use its just wanted yet good
question

928
00:56:54,920 --> 00:56:59,880
so the WageWorks so is a few
configuration options once use a VPN

929
00:56:59,880 --> 00:57:03,880
so brings the VPN from this device to
the server and that's nice because then

930
00:57:03,880 --> 00:57:05,160
I can send all traffic

931
00:57:05,160 --> 00:57:09,400
and set the traffic through the VPN so
Texas on that one central device on the

932
00:57:09,400 --> 00:57:09,990
server

933
00:57:09,990 --> 00:57:14,869
other option is catching data locally
and his Web Services see crisis the data

934
00:57:14,869 --> 00:57:19,580
now in a synchronizing the data you have
the option to flush date immediately

935
00:57:19,580 --> 00:57:24,280
this is a synchronized really would
likely butts yet to capture device

936
00:57:24,280 --> 00:57:27,790
and physically a plug the memory card
though he the sea the

937
00:57:27,790 --> 00:57:30,900
I'm the key for the for the web server
to um

938
00:57:30,900 --> 00:57:34,230
a did sink the data will get the VPN
Preds

939
00:57:34,230 --> 00:57:38,950
but what's nice is on the I don't have
on this one but are not here for example

940
00:57:38,950 --> 00:57:40,230
is an accelerometer

941
00:57:40,230 --> 00:57:43,510
he can get a USB accelerometer for the
device and

942
00:57:43,510 --> 00:57:47,470
a plugin that to fix error on jazz
activated in some way

943
00:57:47,470 --> 00:57:51,570
destroy the device so this flash the
filesystem course views encrypted file

944
00:57:51,570 --> 00:57:52,609
system as well

945
00:57:52,609 --> 00:57:55,720
then you can stay just shut down but
you're using several Monte have a

946
00:57:55,720 --> 00:57:56,859
self-destruct mode

947
00:57:56,859 --> 00:57:59,920
I wanted use them I to this I couldn't
so I just

948
00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:03,760
the lead to the data cool

949
00:58:03,760 --> 00:58:08,630
any other questions up

950
00:58:08,630 --> 00:58:10,550
excellent well thanks very much for your
time
