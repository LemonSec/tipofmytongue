1
00:00:00,179 --> 00:00:03,980
the talk I mean it today is covering a
building it's really a look at

2
00:00:03,980 --> 00:00:08,380
access control facility management
systems so hopefully come away with this

3
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:11,550
thanks to black out for happy hour hurts
me experience

4
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:15,740
I and hopefully a you get alerts near so

5
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:18,949
a little bit about me that my hand on
Twitter sure to follow me

6
00:00:18,949 --> 00:00:23,730
I'm if you go to Twitter look at my bio
to dramatic asking is all smuggler kinda

7
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:25,830
an old story we can talk about the bar

8
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:30,160
but that is really me I'm currently
director horribly research and write a

9
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:31,330
Logitech Wallace

10
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:34,920
I had a startup that this crisp on a
cost per point does acquired by another

11
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:36,100
company got silence

12
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:40,570
I worked at Google previously as a tech
lead for Google's occasion called what's

13
00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:44,960
a really good experience there web stats
for web or other product security

14
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:48,550
so preemie I was also really singer for
Google+

15
00:00:48,550 --> 00:00:52,980
I worked at Microsoft as well as a
security program manager for Internet

16
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:53,579
Explorer

17
00:00:53,579 --> 00:00:57,530
its at piece of turbine her but I'll
said it's really singer for online

18
00:00:57,530 --> 00:00:58,250
services

19
00:00:58,250 --> 00:01:02,539
pretty neat stuff I have a couple
degrees I think it really matters here

20
00:01:02,539 --> 00:01:06,010
post couple books actually this case
here

21
00:01:06,010 --> 00:01:09,100
Cooper I'm but I think most importantly

22
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:12,710
they look into initial control systems
over the last couple years and we have

23
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:13,350
about

24
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:17,720
it says thirty publicly true accredited
you know I sister advisers I think it's

25
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:18,549
a bit more

26
00:01:18,549 --> 00:01:21,580
and I still think I did this with a
colleague of mine

27
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:24,950
I still think we are like the top your
group to have the most

28
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:28,790
I sister advisories if that means
anything to anyone so we work with a lot

29
00:01:28,790 --> 00:01:29,680
different vendors

30
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:34,189
we report over 1000 officious DHS mostly
involving decir control system so

31
00:01:34,189 --> 00:01:37,310
some of them will probably never be
fixed if you find it

32
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:41,350
interesting time to buy presents and as
the stars so what

33
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:44,710
i wanna talk to you about facility
manager controls

34
00:01:44,710 --> 00:01:48,939
in-building essentially and so why you
is one answer some Why What Lies sporty

35
00:01:48,939 --> 00:01:52,280
so we actually know that buildings are
being attacked so

36
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:56,180
if you look at this I see a certain
thing monitor from last year it was the

37
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:58,979
January to March might be monitored
there's a link up their critical get

38
00:01:58,979 --> 00:01:59,570
herself

39
00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:03,909
we know that publicly acknowledged
there's two buildings our attacked

40
00:02:03,909 --> 00:02:07,409
the energy management systems are attack
so one was a

41
00:02:07,409 --> 00:02:10,899
a state facility I don't know where it
was but

42
00:02:10,899 --> 00:02:14,270
bass guitar asleep or just ate so state
agency of some kind

43
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:17,640
the other one was a manufacturing plant
in New Jersey so

44
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:21,090
in when you think about these these
incidents so

45
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:24,560
the way that I think about it is most
the damage a tumor probably do via

46
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:27,090
energy management system or facility
management system

47
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:30,840
if I go unnoticed in fact if something
changes or something breaks

48
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:33,470
the prices car technician in the
technician probably just change whatever

49
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:34,030
broke

50
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:38,489
so in order for someone to be called in
specific leader for DHS to be called in

51
00:02:38,489 --> 00:02:39,550
to investigate something

52
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:43,760
espy pretty significant so arm if your
air conditioner goes out even if it's a

53
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:44,720
very sensitive

54
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:47,980
facility like a hospital or surgical
center I'm

55
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:51,260
you might be able to picture pretty
quick right but to have some kind of

56
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:52,080
affect where

57
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:55,410
it's so bad that you want to reach out
to some place like ths

58
00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:59,720
I'm that's probably really that right so
the details of what happened here

59
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:03,540
they're not revealed but I just kind it
you know report some threads here

60
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:06,780
try to figure out what happened your to
the end organization

61
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:10,209
I'm it's hard to say and the reason
that's hard to say it's because

62
00:03:10,209 --> 00:03:13,370
each building management system is the
same

63
00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:16,480
but the buildings that they manage are
all different right so

64
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:20,010
I'm pretty much everything going to run
into you the way that are configured in

65
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:22,269
a way that the building management
system runs the building

66
00:03:22,269 --> 00:03:26,280
whether it's Energy Manager access
control or just environmental control

67
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:29,230
usually it's done differently from even
the building that's gonna be next door

68
00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:31,129
so it's something that's very important
to understand

69
00:03:31,129 --> 00:03:34,950
so the more you understand about the
various pieces which kinda stay the same

70
00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:38,920
the better but when you actually take
over a building the facility magistrate

71
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:40,040
energy management system

72
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:43,879
pretty much every time you do it's going
to be different right so

73
00:03:43,879 --> 00:03:47,280
what is a facility management system
they're very invisible

74
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:51,569
if your fortune what if your fortune
1000 if you have a corporate campus

75
00:03:51,569 --> 00:03:54,870
if you have a badge reader on the door
that you going to for work

76
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:58,480
you actually have personally met system
demanded system building automation

77
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,959
system whatever you wanna call it we
actually have those

78
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:04,629
and the building this officially that
were right now has tons

79
00:04:04,629 --> 00:04:08,650
officially measured systems it so
include things like art accessed it's

80
00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:09,489
not magic

81
00:04:09,489 --> 00:04:12,730
you know a lot of times what happens is
the low battery on the door

82
00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:16,040
it doesn't make a decision by itself
what it does is just collect data and

83
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:18,030
this be sent off to a pinch or someplace

84
00:04:18,030 --> 00:04:21,530
and the controller actually forgot
someplace else whether to a database

85
00:04:21,530 --> 00:04:23,590
lookup urs other sort some other type a
lookup

86
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:27,060
basically does a logic an application
server and sends data back saying

87
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:30,669
you should democracy not a mark or do
something else so same thing with video

88
00:04:30,669 --> 00:04:31,520
right so

89
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:35,270
every modern facility has surveillance
I'm a lot of times it's gonna be at

90
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:35,790
what's

91
00:04:35,790 --> 00:04:38,990
gonna be allowed is to serve the people
doing the surveillance

92
00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:42,930
can probably pan the camera zoom in zoom
out take a look at these switch cameras

93
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:46,660
I'm you're back in the day this used to
be closer to but always move to IP now

94
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:50,979
spree interesting water its manager HTTP
I'm intrusion

95
00:04:50,979 --> 00:04:54,550
so Wes intrusion nothing about likes nor
like that

96
00:04:54,550 --> 00:04:57,860
doing about like if someone breaks a
window or kicks in the door

97
00:04:57,860 --> 00:05:01,169
befits a if it's a modern facility alarm
is going to go off it's all gonna get

98
00:05:01,169 --> 00:05:01,960
notified

99
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:04,930
the way that they do that as your
sensors when the sensors detect that

100
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:07,030
when there's been broken records been
kicked in

101
00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:10,150
what she said the signal someplace AAA
something bad just happened

102
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:14,310
she there trigger alarm asylum /url or
real or contact security make a phone

103
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:14,970
call

104
00:05:14,970 --> 00:05:17,680
I'm is also different things that can
happen so these are physical intrusion

105
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:18,740
devices

106
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:22,520
I'm elevators re badge into an elevator
with your with your room key and take a

107
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:23,410
need to go to the

108
00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:26,840
94 whatever I'm there's actually
computer on the back and it's making

109
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:28,110
that decision saying a

110
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:32,030
should this person be allowed to get off
on that for not right sir

111
00:05:32,030 --> 00:05:34,940
on edge back we're gonna cover some
these examples here for a check

112
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:35,850
specifically

113
00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:38,860
this is probably the most common
facility management system that we see

114
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:39,940
in general

115
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:42,770
and the reason this is probably one of
the most common facility management

116
00:05:42,770 --> 00:05:43,919
systems that we see

117
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:47,360
is not because it's cool it's because
it's very cost-effective

118
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:51,090
so when businesses do you h-back the a
building management system they're doing

119
00:05:51,090 --> 00:05:52,419
it because it's cost-effective

120
00:05:52,419 --> 00:05:56,229
they're gonna save money I know a given
example how they save money

121
00:05:56,229 --> 00:05:59,919
so we look at a datacenter here a couple
years ago

122
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:03,650
officially if you have a data center its
gonna have building automation systems

123
00:06:03,650 --> 00:06:06,900
the environmental controls for the data
center can be controlled by computers

124
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:10,050
there's a facility management systems as
ur building automation systems building

125
00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:11,280
management systems

126
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:15,580
and what this particular data center was
doing was it was basically monitoring

127
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:19,460
the prices of energy so if they were
cheaper to run on fuel

128
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:23,020
it which which all the energy to fuel it
or cheaper to run off the grid its

129
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:27,199
it switched to the grid it was cheaper
to pull in cold air from the outside as

130
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:28,910
opposed to just generating cold air

131
00:06:28,910 --> 00:06:32,600
via air conditioners it would do that
and so what it was doing as

132
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:35,560
understanding what's the cheapest way to
basically call the state senator they

133
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:37,449
constantly readjusting all the time

134
00:06:37,449 --> 00:06:40,300
and it resulted in a tremendous cost
savings for the organization install the

135
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:41,100
systems

136
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:44,280
and that's why they did they didn't do
it cuz it was cool they did it cuz it

137
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:45,949
into the day they know that their save
money

138
00:06:45,949 --> 00:06:48,970
that's why a lot of buildings happily
managed systems in them especially

139
00:06:48,970 --> 00:06:51,039
things for environmental control

140
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:54,039
same up lighting becoming more and more
common

141
00:06:54,039 --> 00:06:57,560
to control lighting I yet you know like
building management system

142
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:01,130
it's the same reason just for
cost-effectiveness energy energy savings

143
00:07:01,130 --> 00:07:02,050
cost savings

144
00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:05,979
so and you can actually really cool
thing so if you live in a building

145
00:07:05,979 --> 00:07:09,770
and you sure the building with a lot of
other folks you get into electricity

146
00:07:09,770 --> 00:07:10,319
bill

147
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:13,229
it's probably done by I don't imagine
system the bill imagine system

148
00:07:13,229 --> 00:07:15,240
understands what your electricity usage
is

149
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:17,870
up for a given point in time and then
basically sensual bill for that

150
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:18,660
particular

151
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:21,789
use it right so it's pretty cool very
interesting stuff

152
00:07:21,789 --> 00:07:25,650
so or start to see that's pretty recent
consolidation all these different

153
00:07:25,650 --> 00:07:26,500
systems

154
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:29,830
so if you look at the systems in the
past there they've all been these

155
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:32,639
different silat systems are basically
never talk to each other

156
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:36,530
or action star to see now is they're all
certificates all it together

157
00:07:36,530 --> 00:07:39,470
a good example of something that's
already consolidated gather in a very

158
00:07:39,470 --> 00:07:40,280
meaningful way

159
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:44,539
are fire alarm systems we're taking a
look at number up differ fire learning

160
00:07:44,539 --> 00:07:45,379
system so

161
00:07:45,379 --> 00:07:49,169
if a fire alarm goes off in like a
facility like this its gonna trigger

162
00:07:49,169 --> 00:07:52,220
a budget different events so the fire
learning system is probably gonna go to

163
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:54,300
fire fire department someplace and say
hey look

164
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:57,830
based on the sensors that I have in the
facility I think the fires a spigot on

165
00:07:57,830 --> 00:07:58,569
this floor

166
00:07:58,569 --> 00:08:01,680
it's this type of fire fire weather
chemical or wood or whatever

167
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:04,669
I was going to notify those people there
but also do really interesting things

168
00:08:04,669 --> 00:08:05,110
like

169
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:08,330
maybe it'll turn up to a track systems
for that pic particular for

170
00:08:08,330 --> 00:08:11,720
so the smoke will get put into the Ducks
things like that maybe altar of certain

171
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:12,750
electrical systems

172
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:16,160
maybe it'll disable the elevator source
are to see that these a billing and

173
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,190
assistance for sure start to be
consolidated

174
00:08:18,190 --> 00:08:21,240
all start to talk to each other and the
bass kick you control each other which

175
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:24,030
is actually interesting

176
00:08:24,030 --> 00:08:27,550
on ever talk about a couple different
culture and the reason I think this once

177
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:28,979
there's just a budget and more

178
00:08:28,979 --> 00:08:31,610
orders but there is I think these ones
are interesting it's called I call this

179
00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:32,630
device passer

180
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:36,450
retrieval for Billy resenting says
interesting is

181
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:39,909
all doing that it is is there a look
that houses were built for some reason

182
00:08:39,909 --> 00:08:43,169
where you can actually just touch the
the billing agent system remotely

183
00:08:43,169 --> 00:08:46,930
and pulled passer toute so I don't know
if it's like one person basically

184
00:08:46,930 --> 00:08:48,920
working all these billion pension
systems

185
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:51,890
or purchase some weird thing are
designed the way these folks are taught

186
00:08:51,890 --> 00:08:52,529
but I

187
00:08:52,529 --> 00:08:55,580
we we've come across a couple couple
different ones so the issue building

188
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:58,480
management systems are presented here to
Niagara framework and missus

189
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:01,690
probably to the most popular going
medicines in the world

190
00:09:01,690 --> 00:09:05,250
so-and-so for the Niagara basically an
authenticated user can retrieve the

191
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:06,300
device passer

192
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:09,839
that's just an story device password
action code it's not a crypt it's not

193
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:11,310
hasher thing like that

194
00:09:11,310 --> 00:09:14,620
I'm if you know how they encourage a
candy cane we know how to record it so

195
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:16,140
we can deter the passwords

196
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:19,490
I know what you did to the passage you
have a clear text password and login any

197
00:09:19,490 --> 00:09:22,839
with any account that you want are you
most likely want to add

198
00:09:22,839 --> 00:09:26,290
login with the administrator account and
so whatever

199
00:09:26,290 --> 00:09:29,870
system that building manager system is
running on it can run on three different

200
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:33,250
a platform to run on Windows it can run
on QNX

201
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:37,170
a run on Lex right so if you get it on
Windows box of system

202
00:09:37,170 --> 00:09:40,899
to get on at your next box or we expect
to get ripped so because the framework

203
00:09:40,899 --> 00:09:42,800
is running as root

204
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:46,279
and that's pretty cool is gay rutan
underlying device

205
00:09:46,279 --> 00:09:49,769
rights of that device is connected to
something be another ticket a protocol

206
00:09:49,769 --> 00:09:51,709
or clear text for a call like

207
00:09:51,709 --> 00:09:55,450
back network my bus whatever it's
connected to ever network it's on

208
00:09:55,450 --> 00:09:58,760
you'll be able to talk to those devices
well I'm if it so if it's a Windows

209
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:00,140
machine censure system

210
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:03,829
you'll be able to extract any kind a
credit of their so admin login to there

211
00:10:03,829 --> 00:10:04,700
are two main actors

212
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:07,760
like that to be able to get it passed of
its

213
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:10,950
a same with the Medicis device
authenticated user Kercher the device

214
00:10:10,950 --> 00:10:12,040
password

215
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:15,300
in this case the password actually
hashed shot one are

216
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:18,860
but you can also do not indicate a
battery separator user so

217
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:23,010
if for some reason one other users like
the admin user has released out password

218
00:10:23,010 --> 00:10:26,160
you can just pass receptor and the
market with a password that you want

219
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:26,810
right so

220
00:10:26,810 --> 00:10:30,440
essentially its authentication all such
a depth of Education bypass but there

221
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:33,880
are other bugs that just allow you to do
what occasion bypasses

222
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:38,510
call various things to interact with the
device maker do things

223
00:10:38,510 --> 00:10:41,670
and then there's also wat you are
compromised underlying system

224
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:45,040
which is always interesting because the
frameworks are really good

225
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:48,209
in fact there developed to allow
engineers and operators

226
00:10:48,209 --> 00:10:51,279
to easily manage devices that are
connected to you right because you don't

227
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:51,620
want

228
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:54,660
engineers have to write my buser back at
every single time they want you

229
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:58,329
adjust the temperature point for an HX
system so you wanna make it very easy

230
00:10:58,329 --> 00:10:59,079
for them

231
00:10:59,079 --> 00:11:02,200
you want them to do literally click a
button and type in a your

232
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:06,079
temperature and have that AST that
temperature point set to you in a check

233
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:06,800
system

234
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:10,010
so if you can compromise underlying
system

235
00:11:10,010 --> 00:11:13,240
you don't have to worry about a the
researchers at the framework put it

236
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:16,880
so if the framework has some paper
research that says hey I don't like you

237
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:19,920
I don't like it when he said not now for
my buser back into that particular

238
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:20,589
device

239
00:11:20,589 --> 00:11:23,829
I don't want to allow that if you
compromise underlying system you can

240
00:11:23,829 --> 00:11:25,740
just do it yourself you can use to
everyone

241
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:28,630
right so compromiser the underlying
system is always interesting when it

242
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:29,360
comes to you

243
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:33,300
devices like this and then of course
upper lateral escalation for you know

244
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:34,880
lateral escalation reasons

245
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:38,529
a compromise that alexis is always so

246
00:11:38,529 --> 00:11:42,060
on this is the tree in Niagara framework
it up on this device is what they look

247
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:42,930
like

248
00:11:42,930 --> 00:11:47,230
unit second industrial boxes text your
box reply find a closet someplace

249
00:11:47,230 --> 00:11:51,350
on this a Johnson patrol missus so
controller I'm if I find this a closet

250
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:52,290
someplace as well

251
00:11:52,290 --> 00:11:54,829
this is not something that you would see
like mounted onto the wall in your hotel

252
00:11:54,829 --> 00:11:55,459
room

253
00:11:55,459 --> 00:11:59,160
this actually control or so the you know
that thermostat and the

254
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:02,019
environmental controls in your room
would actually get to this device in

255
00:12:02,019 --> 00:12:02,940
place across

256
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:06,639
or so the first to get real talk about

257
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:10,440
is physical security because much like
regular computers get physical access to

258
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:11,970
one of these devices a controller's

259
00:12:11,970 --> 00:12:15,670
game over that's by design every single
a vendor every single person

260
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:18,990
acknowledge that that's why they always
recommend that you like these things up

261
00:12:18,990 --> 00:12:21,649
and don't allow anyone to physical
access to it right so

262
00:12:21,649 --> 00:12:25,540
a lot times of consular access work you
can get to it you can either plugin

263
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:30,060
usually via serial Rs 232 yards for 85
notice have a shell is actually on the

264
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:32,000
device these are very pretty or

265
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,829
so up the technician services passwords
and was always work on your physical

266
00:12:35,829 --> 00:12:36,459
access

267
00:12:36,459 --> 00:12:39,600
ice so if you know technische your
search credential should be able to log

268
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,630
interest by Spurs

269
00:12:41,630 --> 00:12:44,810
and then most importantly is wherever
network it's connected to pick up the

270
00:12:44,810 --> 00:12:45,769
slack just to it

271
00:12:45,769 --> 00:12:49,510
you have access at never network as well
turn the reason that important

272
00:12:49,510 --> 00:12:52,620
is because you have access to things
like back net the building

273
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:55,950
you know billing automation control work
it's an authenticator protocol it's

274
00:12:55,950 --> 00:12:57,399
clear text

275
00:12:57,399 --> 00:13:01,149
I'm so basically device are just sitting
listening on this network back net

276
00:13:01,149 --> 00:13:04,329
are and if you get on to that network
somehow you'll be able to talk to all

277
00:13:04,329 --> 00:13:05,450
the devices on the network

278
00:13:05,450 --> 00:13:09,690
that's just the way it's designed so I'm
and the cool thing about that is

279
00:13:09,690 --> 00:13:12,730
a good friend of mine Michael toker

280
00:13:12,730 --> 00:13:15,930
he actually wrote a script to enumerate
BACnet devices

281
00:13:15,930 --> 00:13:19,649
and you put into an app so you can go to
digital ones website

282
00:13:19,649 --> 00:13:23,269
and you can actually download this this
and that's and that script

283
00:13:23,269 --> 00:13:27,040
its intended to be run on internal
network but nothing is stopping anyone

284
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,470
from running it on the internet

285
00:13:28,470 --> 00:13:31,360
rates are in fact if you do run on the
internet you actually find active

286
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,120
devices

287
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:35,389
listening on the internet so this
particular one is Abiomed

288
00:13:35,389 --> 00:13:38,779
boiler system so R and as you can see

289
00:13:38,779 --> 00:13:42,209
with industrial control systems they
what oftentimes

290
00:13:42,209 --> 00:13:45,420
they like to give up a lot of
information about what they are so

291
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:48,639
on the way that this the way that this
enumeration actually works is pretty

292
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:49,459
clever

293
00:13:49,459 --> 00:13:53,639
on what might basically did here was on
there's a way to korea system

294
00:13:53,639 --> 00:13:57,899
where it's in the spec where the device
will actually respond with an air

295
00:13:57,899 --> 00:14:00,829
right so if you see the error message
you know that that's actually BACnet

296
00:14:00,829 --> 00:14:01,930
enabled device

297
00:14:01,930 --> 00:14:04,639
and then what you know that's a back to
enable device you can actually create

298
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:05,690
for information

299
00:14:05,690 --> 00:14:08,940
this so this is the end map plug or the
and map

300
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:12,430
script thats that's their so anyone can
download listen to actually start

301
00:14:12,430 --> 00:14:17,449
rates on your internal network to find
out where your back devices are

302
00:14:17,449 --> 00:14:20,949
very interesting stuff so the physical
access peace

303
00:14:20,949 --> 00:14:25,250
it's extremely important right because
once you have access to the back net

304
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:28,000
the building automation control network
you'll be able to talk to a device on

305
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:28,769
the network

306
00:14:28,769 --> 00:14:32,930
so on and having physical control over
public building

307
00:14:32,930 --> 00:14:35,930
really hard right very very heart so

308
00:14:35,930 --> 00:14:40,399
take this device here for example too
hard to see sexually terms that

309
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:44,089
in on the bottom it's got a a rj-45 Jack

310
00:14:44,089 --> 00:14:47,880
so its it's not like a network jack is
actually with Jack to basically jack

311
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:49,079
into the back net

312
00:14:49,079 --> 00:14:53,019
but I am this device actually by a
better picture

313
00:14:53,019 --> 00:14:58,560
yet to say when or this device was right
at this picture at

314
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:01,850
was at no I was not here

315
00:15:01,850 --> 00:15:05,120
now share this was taken at a.m.

316
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:08,380
when airport so hundreds of these

317
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:11,410
their SATs everywhere right and if you
plug into one of them

318
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:15,399
get on back you talk to any device it's
on the airport back

319
00:15:15,399 --> 00:15:21,209
so pretty interesting sir about this one
when you work on this one

320
00:15:21,209 --> 00:15:25,070
this was really dirty like this is the
dirtiest air saw that I took picture

321
00:15:25,070 --> 00:15:28,170
has preached so there's hundreds of
these

322
00:15:28,170 --> 00:15:31,570
hundreds of them this is at Cedar to
assess really dirty

323
00:15:31,570 --> 00:15:34,570
so same thing I'm rj-45 jack on the
bottom

324
00:15:34,570 --> 00:15:37,639
you plug into that in your own back net
this action its Alexia

325
00:15:37,639 --> 00:15:40,800
work so if you're a public facility

326
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:44,649
and you have things like this tell you
right now almost impossible to keep some

327
00:15:44,649 --> 00:15:46,279
of the building our mission

328
00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:49,420
work Shia if you have access ports like
this persons

329
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:52,750
target so

330
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:56,759
to more about the water bill is so the
Niagara framework

331
00:15:56,759 --> 00:15:59,930
we report a couple different water
release them and said hey you really

332
00:15:59,930 --> 00:16:01,120
need sixties

333
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:05,430
and so they did so some the water bill
is that we came across the

334
00:16:05,430 --> 00:16:08,680
passer she will even the way that they
store their passers included way that

335
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:10,149
they had to be called in crash in

336
00:16:10,149 --> 00:16:13,620
they actually fix that now the hasher
passwords and the result was pretty cool

337
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:14,339
so

338
00:16:14,339 --> 00:16:17,290
I'm just I'm gonna show a couple side
sure about that in about the

339
00:16:17,290 --> 00:16:19,589
vulnerabilities but the actual download
the latest patch

340
00:16:19,589 --> 00:16:22,690
as or believes or game or so that's
pretty neat

341
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:26,490
missus on the other hand we contacted
them in November

342
00:16:26,490 --> 00:16:30,050
we always contact people to GHS right so
we have a third party that can track it

343
00:16:30,050 --> 00:16:30,680
say

344
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:34,630
this is what I notified us forever so
that was April 22nd

345
00:16:34,630 --> 00:16:37,680
and we never heard back I actually until

346
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:41,160
last week like a what he is a doctor
next week

347
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:45,480
or maybe your device so if we look
deeper into Medicis

348
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:49,009
which is what we're gonna County dive
into today the device that we have

349
00:16:49,009 --> 00:16:52,889
actually run twenty so that's actually
really really interesting because

350
00:16:52,889 --> 00:16:56,350
a lot at all that we have this criticism
or anything that we haven't you

351
00:16:56,350 --> 00:16:57,250
previously

352
00:16:57,250 --> 00:17:01,050
right so in fact we little either poor
watched your walls and to you

353
00:17:01,050 --> 00:17:05,679
IDA Pro to say these are x86 excuse such
pretty cool

354
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:08,209
and then some other files actually done
that in some ways we're looking at a

355
00:17:08,209 --> 00:17:10,949
diner some Richard

356
00:17:10,949 --> 00:17:14,250
so if we look at the file systems if you
get when these devices get access to

357
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:18,689
a device I'm or you have some kind of
exploit or or you actually own advice

358
00:17:18,689 --> 00:17:22,380
I'm we look at the actual way it works
is America vice so there's a flash on

359
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:22,850
their

360
00:17:22,850 --> 00:17:27,270
side right kick it like secord that it
just says slash right to go to slash

361
00:17:27,270 --> 00:17:28,110
missus

362
00:17:28,110 --> 00:17:31,860
for all the audit logging configuration
files are right so it's pretty important

363
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:35,039
there there's also another directory
called missus I secure DB

364
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:39,340
security to acknowledge that that's a
file who's basically contains all these

365
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:43,789
searches vice x-mas I'll they are hashed
right shot one

366
00:17:43,789 --> 00:17:48,059
so there's an account on Medicis devices
on their resume an assist device called

367
00:17:48,059 --> 00:17:49,669
missus agent

368
00:17:49,669 --> 00:17:53,960
that is the Medicis system agent that is
user ID 1

369
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:57,419
that is essentially the at been for
missus devices

370
00:17:57,419 --> 00:18:01,780
that's the user account name and so when
you look at the security deduction of

371
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:02,539
I'll

372
00:18:02,539 --> 00:18:06,510
this is what you'll see so you'll see
the user ID 1 if she table users

373
00:18:06,510 --> 00:18:10,260
user ID 1 are you'll see a lot of
interesting things like for example

374
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:14,370
but there is no account lockout for this
this account rikers admin

375
00:18:14,370 --> 00:18:17,809
and this account essentially nevers
never expires so

376
00:18:17,809 --> 00:18:21,470
pretty a campy it's not safe obviously
by default as well

377
00:18:21,470 --> 00:18:24,480
so I guess you could maybe changes

378
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:27,590
I don't know what I would do if you
disable the sys admin account nurture

379
00:18:27,590 --> 00:18:30,799
cessation account literature so

380
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:34,710
most obvious things the version of Win
CE that

381
00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:37,690
is running on the message device
actually has a shell work you just tell

382
00:18:37,690 --> 00:18:38,840
that to it

383
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:41,929
election drop into a shower system
rights go

384
00:18:41,929 --> 00:18:45,000
I'm if you're actually looking for these
on the internal network that's probably

385
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,370
the easiest way to own one of these
devices

386
00:18:47,370 --> 00:18:50,789
right they also usually have another
decade have to pee open as well

387
00:18:50,789 --> 00:18:55,470
so you can FTP into it grab the the the
security be direction of I'll

388
00:18:55,470 --> 00:18:58,690
all passwords crackle passer ever so
pretty interesting but

389
00:18:58,690 --> 00:19:01,740
I don't do that as yet the telnet which
gives you showing its

390
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:05,710
pretty for I don't know made that
decision right but like

391
00:19:05,710 --> 00:19:09,520
is this what needs to happen like no
more for you right no war

392
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:13,980
so I'm a little bit more about the
filesystem there slash storage

393
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:17,440
that can check their content about to
crash dumps I it contains much memory

394
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:18,490
does as well so

395
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:22,130
it to my server crashes for any reason
that's where those files can be held

396
00:19:22,130 --> 00:19:24,929
and those that are pretty interesting
such maybe for a transaction like that

397
00:19:24,929 --> 00:19:27,360
see why a particular device crashed

398
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:31,620
you know what caused it so store just
missus such preferences

399
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:34,880
that a user system preferences are
stored very interesting

400
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:38,520
and there's another directory storage
missus secure GB as a copy of the

401
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:40,419
security direction of I'll

402
00:19:40,419 --> 00:19:43,140
I'm if you don't want to use the action
of I'll you can actually use real

403
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:44,220
database file

404
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:48,880
I it's called its SDF file: which is
basically like a compact compact file

405
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:49,809
format

406
00:19:49,809 --> 00:19:54,090
you can connect to it yeah just regular
data Shriver this week for its

407
00:19:54,090 --> 00:19:57,280
it's basically the same thing as a
security XML got these names and

408
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:58,860
passwords or configurations

409
00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:02,890
users so I'm but what's important to me
is

410
00:20:02,890 --> 00:20:05,390
the thing that's probably gonna be
facing if someone tries to lock down the

411
00:20:05,390 --> 00:20:06,020
shell

412
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:09,669
and FTP is the web interface because
that's how

413
00:20:09,669 --> 00:20:12,840
engineers operators actually manages the
vices whether

414
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:16,429
face so if you look at storage missus
dubbed up a router

415
00:20:16,429 --> 00:20:20,530
such missus xxx the excess axes are
actually versions

416
00:20:20,530 --> 00:20:24,100
that's where the application logic for
the weather faces so very interesting to

417
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:24,799
me

418
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:28,900
the Webroot actually contains like 50
jars and if you actually connect to the

419
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:29,990
web interface

420
00:20:29,990 --> 00:20:33,320
those jars will get download it to your
local system I'm it

421
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:36,820
Medicis does history and as I don't know
why they do this but and a pretty like

422
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:37,900
50

423
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:42,130
if they get some translations of a like
a hundred jars on your local filesystem

424
00:20:42,130 --> 00:20:46,000
so not not it's on a server but to also
get pushed her client

425
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,909
so which is pretty crazy and then so if
we look at a

426
00:20:49,909 --> 00:20:54,830
slash WS there's actually web service
could there that's pretty cool

427
00:20:54,830 --> 00:20:58,360
I'm it so if we look at how the
application logic is implemented

428
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:01,480
if we look at slash WS which is for web
server such been

429
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:05,289
we actually see precompiled dotnet
assemblies there so they don't just have

430
00:21:05,289 --> 00:21:07,200
like aspx files we can just read source

431
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:10,630
right but I'm anyone that knows dotnet
nose at

432
00:21:10,630 --> 00:21:14,470
its you know I also its is later like
best the river straight safety

433
00:21:14,470 --> 00:21:17,970
get the source code if you have the
buyers get the dll's not sure

434
00:21:17,970 --> 00:21:22,130
engineers Minister but so soon as you
get the deal allows you can basically at

435
00:21:22,130 --> 00:21:23,990
the source code for all the deals

436
00:21:23,990 --> 00:21:27,860
and reversing a buyer's actual to preach
the box

437
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:32,169
so we look at the dot that assemblies we
see things that will

438
00:21:32,169 --> 00:21:36,000
retrieve directory listing from the
device which is pretty cool

439
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,809
I'm upload art refile sartre locations
which is really need

440
00:21:39,809 --> 00:21:43,980
there's also web services churchy
retrieve user information clearing the

441
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:45,070
path for cash

442
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:48,110
right because retrieving a password hash
is a

443
00:21:48,110 --> 00:21:52,350
really highly requested feature a super
popular rights every time I should have

444
00:21:52,350 --> 00:21:55,780
some web service to retrieve the user's
password hash

445
00:21:55,780 --> 00:21:58,780
and so if we take a look at what's ur so
common that DLL

446
00:21:58,780 --> 00:22:02,100
on this is what we see in doubt that
reflector right so there's a budget for

447
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:05,520
a class in here how in this important to
me right now is

448
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:08,809
dot security its ok we take a look at
that security

449
00:22:08,809 --> 00:22:12,200
it has a budget different a method that
we can call one which is

450
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:15,860
administration service and if we look at
you know a lot of things are stored in

451
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:16,710
there we see

452
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:20,659
basically it like a a method called get
your property which takes an int

453
00:22:20,659 --> 00:22:24,950
which is used right so this is pretty
valuable since we know that that missus

454
00:22:24,950 --> 00:22:28,039
sis agent is always use right he won
that's pretty cool

455
00:22:28,039 --> 00:22:30,970
if we look at the description it always
returns a property for single-user

456
00:22:30,970 --> 00:22:33,860
stored in the database whether that's
the ex not follow the actual Davis

457
00:22:33,860 --> 00:22:38,360
pretty interesting stuff so if we look
at it differently lol subsys is a common

458
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:39,789
that lol

459
00:22:39,789 --> 00:22:43,289
we see there also has a dot security as
well and if we did a little bit deeper

460
00:22:43,289 --> 00:22:45,640
in there and subsystems the comment that
the lol

461
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:48,950
we see a function call prince will store
Ryan this is basically

462
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:52,740
where user's password and user
permissions getting written in retreat

463
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:53,900
from the device

464
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:59,110
so I'm nevermind the into computer user
and the Medicis agent

465
00:22:59,110 --> 00:23:02,720
default password don't worry about that
for now appreciate for

466
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:06,740
but I'm the prince will start pretty
interesting the text is riding a login

467
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:07,539
name

468
00:23:07,539 --> 00:23:10,710
and every look at how that thing
actually works said she describes all

469
00:23:10,710 --> 00:23:12,650
the information about a particular user

470
00:23:12,650 --> 00:23:16,390
just puttin object itself what service
ever calls it will just return

471
00:23:16,390 --> 00:23:19,669
this giant blob data which is really
interesting rights efforts will start at

472
00:23:19,669 --> 00:23:21,000
your property

473
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,120
and so the way that we would actually
call this webservice

474
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:28,190
it just by going to the security slash
Admin service I S

475
00:23:28,190 --> 00:23:32,020
ASMX webservice I just doing a simple
push requests like

476
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:35,940
like it like any good web service and
just say I'm I want to use get your

477
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:36,830
property

478
00:23:36,830 --> 00:23:41,309
and give the User ID 1 and it'll give
you a response like this rate the most

479
00:23:41,309 --> 00:23:43,690
important thing is likely the user name

480
00:23:43,690 --> 00:23:47,250
but of course the password hash for the
device for that particular user

481
00:23:47,250 --> 00:23:50,600
record so

482
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:53,990
so running a web service to achieve a
user

483
00:23:53,990 --> 00:23:57,409
Pasir Ris 3 dad but its

484
00:23:57,409 --> 00:24:00,480
worse if you just forget to do one thing

485
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:05,570
they were know if that one thing is

486
00:24:05,570 --> 00:24:08,690
you forget to put the Websters behind
authentication right so

487
00:24:08,690 --> 00:24:13,200
the web searches built authenticated
users the anyone can retrieve the

488
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,600
password hash for any user on the device

489
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:19,880
right and so like Wow and so on last
week when you're like a we just were

490
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:20,669
interested

491
00:24:20,669 --> 00:24:24,299
when missus actually contact me and
they're like a we're going to talk next

492
00:24:24,299 --> 00:24:25,130
week

493
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:28,580
sorry we haven't talked in the last
three months but I we're just kinda

494
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:30,799
interested in how you would fix its
portability

495
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:35,080
like we know how we would fixes words
can imagine what your thoughts are

496
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:38,150
I was like well first occupied on
leadership people's passwords

497
00:24:38,150 --> 00:24:41,610
second of each plaque put this behind
authentication right so

498
00:24:41,610 --> 00:24:45,110
you know a song I was like wow you know
whoever wrote that web searches

499
00:24:45,110 --> 00:24:48,150
had one job right click 8

500
00:24:48,150 --> 00:24:53,309
yet one job yet one operate your this
web service

501
00:24:53,309 --> 00:24:56,799
you forgot to put it behind
authentication you had one job like and

502
00:24:56,799 --> 00:25:01,049
spree that so that's pretty cool though

503
00:25:01,049 --> 00:25:04,340
so when you get a username and password
you log into device this is what you'll

504
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:05,169
see

505
00:25:05,169 --> 00:25:08,640
and so this is interesting cuz I was
your show people this because a lot of

506
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:11,240
times people are very intimidated by
things like building

507
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:15,299
measured systems officially imagine
systems I think it's just weird thing

508
00:25:15,299 --> 00:25:18,440
you know where you drop it and it's like
totally you know you can't cover and

509
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:19,309
what's going on

510
00:25:19,309 --> 00:25:22,640
that it's the furthest thing from the
truth in fact when you walk into a bill

511
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:25,559
modern building and a system you're
gonna see something like this

512
00:25:25,559 --> 00:25:29,090
right its very user friendly it's really
just a web interface for you to say look

513
00:25:29,090 --> 00:25:30,770
I want to push this button reset this

514
00:25:30,770 --> 00:25:34,080
set point for this particular device or
do whatever it is so

515
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:36,419
if you drop down to the underlying
device you want to communicate to a

516
00:25:36,419 --> 00:25:37,529
device in a way that's not

517
00:25:37,529 --> 00:25:40,570
intended to be communicated to you is
still a bit more complicated reaction

518
00:25:40,570 --> 00:25:42,409
after senator because of her stuff but

519
00:25:42,409 --> 00:25:46,000
for the most part you want to attach a
building you log into the billing engine

520
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:46,710
system

521
00:25:46,710 --> 00:25:49,929
you set the point click so its first
report

522
00:25:49,929 --> 00:25:53,669
so were talking about how prevalent is
building manager systems are on the

523
00:25:53,669 --> 00:25:54,770
Internet right kisses

524
00:25:54,770 --> 00:25:58,409
action you in part by most part par or
talk I'm we basically create this

525
00:25:58,409 --> 00:26:00,929
numeration effort to find as many
Billing Manager two sons

526
00:26:00,929 --> 00:26:05,299
on the Internet as we could so initially
base of showed an

527
00:26:05,299 --> 00:26:08,450
we need to have some custom scares me
said you right so

528
00:26:08,450 --> 00:26:11,990
which I like fifty thousand buildings
most of them are explosive experts

529
00:26:11,990 --> 00:26:13,970
internet or that their choice later at

530
00:26:13,970 --> 00:26:17,429
well throughout dated right so which run
experts again Sam is critical to

531
00:26:17,429 --> 00:26:17,990
billings

532
00:26:17,990 --> 00:26:21,490
any with everyone so stay and hospitals
police stations prisons will

533
00:26:21,490 --> 00:26:22,260
translations

534
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:26,919
like everything you can imagine in fact
I am I brought with me

535
00:26:26,919 --> 00:26:30,690
a Excel spreadsheet aceptar I found on
the internet we can just if you watch

536
00:26:30,690 --> 00:26:31,169
others

537
00:26:31,169 --> 00:26:34,179
let you guys say hey or search for
police station and I just like their

538
00:26:34,179 --> 00:26:35,350
control if we can find

539
00:26:35,350 --> 00:26:39,100
stations so all total plight of either a
box

540
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:42,179
to buy the devices from a yday

541
00:26:42,179 --> 00:26:46,059
and 10 for the easy to time right so not
too expensive

542
00:26:46,059 --> 00:26:50,090
okay so aren't they were actually really
prevalent on the Internet

543
00:26:50,090 --> 00:26:57,090
right so well show you here some stuff
that we've done

544
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:06,799
okay so this is my worst upstart

545
00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:12,210
right so or over to the top

546
00:27:12,210 --> 00:27:19,210
and so we a researcher

547
00:27:19,210 --> 00:27:22,610
I I'm actually look at 704 so

548
00:27:22,610 --> 00:27:25,659
up there's like some health agencies I
found I'm

549
00:27:25,659 --> 00:27:29,210
this spreadsheet I have actually it
doesn't have the location

550
00:27:29,210 --> 00:27:32,429
I'm I could easily do it but I am and
usually when I start when should I do

551
00:27:32,429 --> 00:27:34,710
publications last by the best place

552
00:27:34,710 --> 00:27:38,190
espy the best way to find stuff but this
just has names right so

553
00:27:38,190 --> 00:27:41,470
which other peacekeeping names we can
find things

554
00:27:41,470 --> 00:27:46,529
with certain names so about like bank
right let's pick up

555
00:27:46,529 --> 00:27:49,840
so there's one right there they're all
right there

556
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:53,620
it's a there's a right there okay so but
the banks right so

557
00:27:53,620 --> 00:27:57,970
those are not names I pics those are
those are station name so the devices

558
00:27:57,970 --> 00:28:01,710
add these names inside right now sorry I
we got we got the station in turn second

559
00:28:01,710 --> 00:28:02,760
so

560
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:07,140
anything else

561
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:11,149
school the pedestrian

562
00:28:11,149 --> 00:28:14,370
I don't know school there's up oil our
schools

563
00:28:14,370 --> 00:28:18,029
schools are very popular your

564
00:28:18,029 --> 00:28:22,350
firms fence

565
00:28:22,350 --> 00:28:27,909
I don't see any defense there

566
00:28:27,909 --> 00:28:31,590
okay thank God

567
00:28:31,590 --> 00:28:38,100
that kid hospital skits

568
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:41,750
some hospitals impossible's when I say
Fox

569
00:28:41,750 --> 00:28:45,690
it's basically a protocol that I'm using
Johnson is basically I'm

570
00:28:45,690 --> 00:28:49,929
the integrator sigh I just kinda tag is
I think they're interesting

571
00:28:49,929 --> 00:28:53,799
so let me show you how I got this data
it's free it's pretty straightforward

572
00:28:53,799 --> 00:28:59,000
so have some tools I'm basically

573
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:03,740
I really simple script I just get IP
addresses for things I think or build

574
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:04,559
imagine systems

575
00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:07,760
or you can just scan the entire internet
like all you never

576
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:12,159
ipv4 space you can just say run this
python script right and so

577
00:29:12,159 --> 00:29:15,799
it'll just take that list I P is it just
looks up basically

578
00:29:15,799 --> 00:29:18,679
like you know the back that thing that
we saw there's another protocol called

579
00:29:18,679 --> 00:29:19,429
boxer certain

580
00:29:19,429 --> 00:29:23,299
a particular bill imagine systems a
discrete that services is a consolidated

581
00:29:23,299 --> 00:29:25,250
you have about you

582
00:29:25,250 --> 00:29:28,820
and so what you basically get is
something that's returned like this

583
00:29:28,820 --> 00:29:32,929
so at the top is basically what we call
the station name so

584
00:29:32,929 --> 00:29:36,580
it says Fox that's just attacked for me
but DSC

585
00:29:36,580 --> 00:29:40,340
underscore WS I'm not really sure what
that is

586
00:29:40,340 --> 00:29:43,779
but others are like a whole bunch of
information right so for example

587
00:29:43,779 --> 00:29:47,169
the things running on Windows XP rights
that's pretty interesting it also tells

588
00:29:47,169 --> 00:29:48,940
me the exact version

589
00:29:48,940 --> 00:29:51,740
that this particular billing and dismiss
right as well so which is extremely

590
00:29:51,740 --> 00:29:52,250
helpful

591
00:29:52,250 --> 00:29:55,370
have a budget for next week's I know
which ex which will work

592
00:29:55,370 --> 00:29:59,230
and tell me what time zone it's an it
also tells me what the license ideas for

593
00:29:59,230 --> 00:30:01,480
particular device right so I have
another tool

594
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:04,890
where I can take a licence ID its work

595
00:30:04,890 --> 00:30:08,770
so this is a license right here

596
00:30:08,770 --> 00:30:13,840
so I have another to or can't say a
given a particular license

597
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:17,080
I want to look up what's basically
enabled for that particular license rate

598
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:17,580
so

599
00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:22,520
the section of I'll are is the actual
license that the customer purchase

600
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:25,840
and the cool thing about this licenses
it tells you all the features

601
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:30,029
that their authorized to run and so if I
find a particular component work I'm

602
00:30:30,029 --> 00:30:31,340
looking for something

603
00:30:31,340 --> 00:30:35,010
in particular I can basically look at
the license files and understand what it

604
00:30:35,010 --> 00:30:37,610
is I want to go after so for example

605
00:30:37,610 --> 00:30:41,890
um like a like an RE drivers Ryan re:
drivers may only be used for certain

606
00:30:41,890 --> 00:30:42,919
things like what's a

607
00:30:42,919 --> 00:30:46,120
power meter for example I just one look
at power meters

608
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:49,940
I can just a cameo licenses that and
re-enable

609
00:30:49,940 --> 00:30:52,830
and then you can just start from there
pretty cool stuff and then at the bottom

610
00:30:52,830 --> 00:30:54,240
is basically

611
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:58,669
I'm a different up differ way parsing
the data and so we didn't know at DSC

612
00:30:58,669 --> 00:30:59,279
was

613
00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:02,230
but now we do because we know that the
project for this device actually doctor

614
00:31:02,230 --> 00:31:03,380
surgery center

615
00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:06,909
so we just enumerated going then justice
in for surgery center rights

616
00:31:06,909 --> 00:31:10,840
it's not good is not get whenever you
tell you that that is not good

617
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:14,669
so a pretty interesting stuff right so
the good thing is

618
00:31:14,669 --> 00:31:18,529
I was assured a Python script at once a
look if you want to rate the stuff

619
00:31:18,529 --> 00:31:21,710
here's python script but then everyone
to be running the psych

620
00:31:21,710 --> 00:31:24,980
skin across internet refineries
buildings and stuff

621
00:31:24,980 --> 00:31:29,039
and so instead what we do is we just I
just talked to the guys showed an shyt I

622
00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:29,950
just do this

623
00:31:29,950 --> 00:31:33,940
that way no one else s and so take a
look at this and

624
00:31:33,940 --> 00:31:37,130
this is basically how your career it's
the same information here right and

625
00:31:37,130 --> 00:31:38,419
there's

626
00:31:38,419 --> 00:31:42,809
15,000 367 buildings that can be
identified with just this method

627
00:31:42,809 --> 00:31:46,350
rights are not everybody medicine has
this particular method enabled

628
00:31:46,350 --> 00:31:49,610
so as you can see there are a lot of
buildings online so

629
00:31:49,610 --> 00:31:52,860
the top on the risk up on it but what I
want whatever one actually show you

630
00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:54,210
here's I'm

631
00:31:54,210 --> 00:31:57,720
this is actually more interesting to me
here so let's take a look at this I know

632
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:59,179
it's kinda hard to see

633
00:31:59,179 --> 00:32:02,559
but if we take a look at this particular
one the station ID

634
00:32:02,559 --> 00:32:06,120
is Norstar financial right so

635
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:10,010
guessing that's kinda bank right on
what's it look at the one below as well

636
00:32:10,010 --> 00:32:10,610
so

637
00:32:10,610 --> 00:32:14,110
this is a good one to you I'm which all
diamond right so that's pretty

638
00:32:14,110 --> 00:32:15,140
interesting

639
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:18,490
and then we take a look at this one here
pure eighty

640
00:32:18,490 --> 00:32:22,330
admin right so but could be right if
things

641
00:32:22,330 --> 00:32:25,710
this one here is vine 500 so

642
00:32:25,710 --> 00:32:29,250
but the reason I i want to point out is
because if we look at where these

643
00:32:29,250 --> 00:32:33,190
eyepiece for I'm with not forget the G
locations for second but

644
00:32:33,190 --> 00:32:37,460
we look at where these IP's are there
are not an organizational IP space

645
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:41,779
it's actually an ISP IP address space so
this one is Cox medication

646
00:32:41,779 --> 00:32:45,760
this is Norstar financial so it's not
endorsed or financial IP blocks

647
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:49,720
right and if we look at a hotel diamond

648
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:53,070
its in AT&T Internet services IP address
space

649
00:32:53,070 --> 00:32:56,450
so it's not in hotel diamond IP address
space right

650
00:32:56,450 --> 00:32:59,559
this is really important so if we look
at on pure

651
00:32:59,559 --> 00:33:02,960
eighty admin it's not in pure eighty
admins IP space

652
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:06,080
it's in AT&T answers space and the
reason that

653
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:10,799
this is the case is because when you buy
a building management system

654
00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:13,890
you don't have your employees install
the bill imagine system for you

655
00:33:13,890 --> 00:33:17,260
you always hire third-party contractor
that guys in hard hats coming and it's

656
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:18,019
not for you

657
00:33:18,019 --> 00:33:21,600
right and those folks are known as
integrators and so what the interpreters

658
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:23,820
will do is they'll take down your
requirements are

659
00:33:23,820 --> 00:33:27,289
for a place like this to say hey look I
want to be cool in every single room at

660
00:33:27,289 --> 00:33:29,110
what temperature variance be this is
this

661
00:33:29,110 --> 00:33:31,840
and I want to build a turn-on and
turn-off all the aces for all the

662
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:33,880
solution one centralized location

663
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:37,740
and integrators I can do that and they
pick out the particular device is that

664
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:38,750
they want to install

665
00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:41,789
probably want to do that we showed you
here maybe some very know that

666
00:33:41,789 --> 00:33:45,559
and they'll install into the building
right and then what they'll do is

667
00:33:45,559 --> 00:33:48,720
sending someone out to building to this
could you maintenance

668
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:52,519
is actually really expensive so they
like to do is take cable modem

669
00:33:52,519 --> 00:33:56,659
or DSL line walk into the closet relying
to it and hope their bill demanded

670
00:33:56,659 --> 00:33:57,360
system up

671
00:33:57,360 --> 00:34:00,880
to the DSL line that's why we see so
many building management systems

672
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:05,090
in commercial I P ISP's IP spaces

673
00:34:05,090 --> 00:34:09,369
so in fact I'm if you're looking for
your own building management systems

674
00:34:09,369 --> 00:34:09,990
online

675
00:34:09,990 --> 00:34:13,409
is probably not in your IP block only
place I really see them

676
00:34:13,409 --> 00:34:16,490
in in in a organizational IP blocker
schools

677
00:34:16,490 --> 00:34:21,399
like the stuff on here this is
California State University network

678
00:34:21,399 --> 00:34:25,399
so university is for some reason the
other billy madison's their IP blocks

679
00:34:25,399 --> 00:34:28,810
for everything else it's usually in a
commercial ISP space

680
00:34:28,810 --> 00:34:32,690
place so if you're looking for the
system's scan your IP block is probably

681
00:34:32,690 --> 00:34:33,730
not the way to go

682
00:34:33,730 --> 00:34:36,609
instead what you need to do is basically
scan the internet and look for other

683
00:34:36,609 --> 00:34:39,159
meditative that associate that could be
your system

684
00:34:39,159 --> 00:34:42,649
right sir let's see if there's a

685
00:34:42,649 --> 00:34:49,649
sheer prequel stuff

686
00:34:50,899 --> 00:34:54,379
so what's up on your I can go showed an
down

687
00:34:54,379 --> 00:34:57,730
it's a running Python script you can
actually look up stuff as well so in

688
00:34:57,730 --> 00:35:02,020
um it can be on ipv6

689
00:35:02,020 --> 00:35:06,869
yep it supports ipv6 ID report which
were common

690
00:35:06,869 --> 00:35:10,619
so I'm just kinda blah run-through of
the export so

691
00:35:10,619 --> 00:35:14,010
there's a budget for Barnardo's work and
pull down various configuration files

692
00:35:14,010 --> 00:35:15,099
this was actually patched

693
00:35:15,099 --> 00:35:18,099
this is what the configuration file for
tritium system looks like

694
00:35:18,099 --> 00:35:21,440
so we can pull this thing down. they're
just section here that has

695
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:25,170
used as a passwords passwords and coated
with its getting kinda password

696
00:35:25,170 --> 00:35:29,140
I'm if we know how the pastor Tim Curry
begins to code it so this password just

697
00:35:29,140 --> 00:35:30,910
happens to be decoded to anyone's guess

698
00:35:30,910 --> 00:35:34,380
so pretty interesting I'm I out again
early sis wanna know how productive it

699
00:35:34,380 --> 00:35:36,250
is but you can find these things

700
00:35:36,250 --> 00:35:41,020
I it's virtually all too right yourself
it's patched and so

701
00:35:41,020 --> 00:35:44,470
something more interesting choices that
we've seen a like at doing that its

702
00:35:44,470 --> 00:35:44,900
systems

703
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:47,910
really cool right like this right here
is a jacket

704
00:35:47,910 --> 00:35:51,380
writer the user interface actually
really into it and on how you use it

705
00:35:51,380 --> 00:35:54,400
so something like that also Precor
weather system

706
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:58,809
cool as pilot their Gables residential
tower

707
00:35:58,809 --> 00:36:02,589
like me and you stick with boeing's
recall of galaxy

708
00:36:02,589 --> 00:36:06,099
so really have the screenshot here is
once again

709
00:36:06,099 --> 00:36:08,440
we're talking about how all these
billing agent systems are kinda

710
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:09,220
consolidating

711
00:36:09,220 --> 00:36:12,289
so we take a look at this particular
facility manager to some

712
00:36:12,289 --> 00:36:15,470
we see a bunch of different things that
right so she said emergency his loss

713
00:36:15,470 --> 00:36:16,440
after temperatures

714
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:20,119
all sandwiches security systems so this
is an instance where the security

715
00:36:20,119 --> 00:36:22,619
systems actually tied into the facility
magic system

716
00:36:22,619 --> 00:36:25,770
right it's pretty neat so now we know
that if we're able to actually

717
00:36:25,770 --> 00:36:27,359
compromise underlying device

718
00:36:27,359 --> 00:36:30,529
we can actually talk to security systems
if you want you what the security

719
00:36:30,529 --> 00:36:32,240
systems are not sure but

720
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:37,510
pretty interesting stuff so this one's
really cause well there's a 100 CPP is

721
00:36:37,510 --> 00:36:40,859
open charging protocol

722
00:36:40,859 --> 00:36:44,960
right so this is like a electric
charging stance in place

723
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:48,839
so that's pretty and then a I guess
those white less right there that's like

724
00:36:48,839 --> 00:36:49,520
badges

725
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:52,829
people who care got charging station
actions Jersey

726
00:36:52,829 --> 00:36:56,200
so pretty cool stuff I'm we found this
one

727
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:59,359
a little while ago as very surprised is

728
00:36:59,359 --> 00:37:03,099
a bill to the internet with no
authentication we actually have a list

729
00:37:03,099 --> 00:37:06,450
a building's other about 2,000 that we
know up

730
00:37:06,450 --> 00:37:09,940
where if you can just get the IP address
you're actually

731
00:37:09,940 --> 00:37:13,220
on the billing engine system so this
jack

732
00:37:13,220 --> 00:37:17,319
this is one that we found are sprinter
say

733
00:37:17,319 --> 00:37:21,740
writer like wow 3 cool so yeah right
that's pretty cool

734
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:25,400
on were like why they set this up that
I'm back here this is the moment

735
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:26,210
controls

736
00:37:26,210 --> 00:37:29,779
like all the different sections they
have for the arena basically the same

737
00:37:29,779 --> 00:37:32,200
I'm in a bit of it and I think you're
probably most important pieces would be

738
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:34,039
like equipment room where the
temperature série

739
00:37:34,039 --> 00:37:37,809
like highly regulated maybe I don't know
but this is

740
00:37:37,809 --> 00:37:41,500
Primeau report is a breaker status so
when you look at PR five direction of

741
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:42,309
the Breakers

742
00:37:42,309 --> 00:37:45,760
other owner of any given moment right so
this is Tasha breakers

743
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:49,799
she so there's a process right there so
there's some

744
00:37:49,799 --> 00:37:54,089
there some ups is other apps 1up's to on
there some other things pr5

745
00:37:54,089 --> 00:37:57,119
there's there's like 10 it is pure want
to keep your tent so

746
00:37:57,119 --> 00:38:00,420
what's different things and then using
the tool that we had we can identify

747
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:02,279
exactly who install this thing

748
00:38:02,279 --> 00:38:05,809
LA installations we contacted them on
the phone we said hey dude you should

749
00:38:05,809 --> 00:38:07,089
probably take this thing off line

750
00:38:07,089 --> 00:38:11,440
at the station in which is important to
guess context because this with in a

751
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:15,069
commercialize P space right so we don't
know

752
00:38:15,069 --> 00:38:17,880
like station names are things like that
P it's kinda hard to tell who they think

753
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:18,770
belongs to you or

754
00:38:18,770 --> 00:38:22,480
what facilities being used to run and
then of course we have the times in

755
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:25,000
which helps confirm like cats is
probably actually for real

756
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:28,690
I later we found out that he was real
and their the reason this device

757
00:38:28,690 --> 00:38:30,970
actually put in place is cuz im pic
broadcasting

758
00:38:30,970 --> 00:38:34,210
folks need to imagine system to be
comfortable water during

759
00:38:34,210 --> 00:38:37,339
broadcasting so they took it offline
pretty quickly so

760
00:38:37,339 --> 00:38:42,920
pretty interesting stuff running Windows
7 so

761
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:46,930
I'm was take a look at some other billy
madison's iron it so

762
00:38:46,930 --> 00:38:51,109
idols about 2,000 not assure all 2000
everyone

763
00:38:51,109 --> 00:38:54,779
but if you look hard enough you'll find
urself so but what's your weekend

764
00:38:54,779 --> 00:38:58,420
you can find her a VM here setup I
wouldn't take a look at

765
00:38:58,420 --> 00:39:01,690
you know what it's like to basically
interact with the bill imagine system so

766
00:39:01,690 --> 00:39:05,789
if you were to run an exploit make
password retrieval

767
00:39:05,789 --> 00:39:09,390
basically pour passer down decoder
whatever crockett and then login this is

768
00:39:09,390 --> 00:39:10,390
basically what you would see

769
00:39:10,390 --> 00:39:13,779
right and so this was pretty cool no
authentication accuses

770
00:39:13,779 --> 00:39:17,259
bra site the address for this one
because I can't run exploits inefficient

771
00:39:17,259 --> 00:39:18,599
system right I can do that

772
00:39:18,599 --> 00:39:21,630
but I have a list of 2006 and refused
Seip

773
00:39:21,630 --> 00:39:25,130
it drops you into this right so
basically if you run an XY get the

774
00:39:25,130 --> 00:39:25,950
password

775
00:39:25,950 --> 00:39:30,049
or if you just find one of these 2000 IP
addresses and go to the IP address

776
00:39:30,049 --> 00:39:33,319
it actually drops you into doing that
system right so

777
00:39:33,319 --> 00:39:37,309
I'm what I like to do is there's a file
folder for this particular billing and a

778
00:39:37,309 --> 00:39:38,250
twosome

779
00:39:38,250 --> 00:39:42,279
there's a spear px this is like the
actual user base files right so

780
00:39:42,279 --> 00:39:46,990
we want to you is basically say hey look
I want to take a look at

781
00:39:46,990 --> 00:39:50,160
in the first floor and the mezzanine
here's

782
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:53,930
in a way that would do that Cisco views
and then WPX

783
00:39:53,930 --> 00:39:56,960
you and this was gonna happen is here
load the interface for me

784
00:39:56,960 --> 00:40:01,029
so than an interface is much more about
what you can see a base on the left hand

785
00:40:01,029 --> 00:40:01,880
side

786
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:05,210
not limited to the user interface for to
do other things a lot of other things

787
00:40:05,210 --> 00:40:06,329
that you can do you

788
00:40:06,329 --> 00:40:09,569
without being limited by the user is
right in fact

789
00:40:09,569 --> 00:40:13,279
if I wanted to I could just people just
play at owned underlying device itself

790
00:40:13,279 --> 00:40:17,000
and they do whatever I want any attached
devices right so the cool thing

791
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:20,259
is what you kinda look at somebody's
building and it is is more more you

792
00:40:20,259 --> 00:40:22,950
start to understand where all the stuff
means right so

793
00:40:22,950 --> 00:40:26,750
like every look at second right which is
by a second for like what he sees

794
00:40:26,750 --> 00:40:30,430
are separate by floors in zones right
that's just the way it kinda separating

795
00:40:30,430 --> 00:40:33,740
a particular devices ounce and things
like that so

796
00:40:33,740 --> 00:40:38,680
take a little bit tighter but I it in
this office on job sites

797
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:42,380
and that's why many civilians there's no
way I would runs record books

798
00:40:42,380 --> 00:40:46,369
so yeah but elections will see

799
00:40:46,369 --> 00:40:51,170
accessing richard is a second are things
like this which are for plans

800
00:40:51,170 --> 00:40:54,650
will show you this its can render here
just one second I'm show you four

801
00:40:54,650 --> 00:40:56,390
planets pictures you

802
00:40:56,390 --> 00:40:59,410
like all environmental controls for this
particular building right and what is

803
00:40:59,410 --> 00:41:00,740
running where

804
00:41:00,740 --> 00:41:05,670
and obviously you can change in the
stuff but what's also cool

805
00:41:05,670 --> 00:41:09,990
after its so I'm as i think is loading

806
00:41:09,990 --> 00:41:13,039
go get another one right so this was
pretty cool I'm because

807
00:41:13,039 --> 00:41:16,630
what the innovators actually like to do
you is actually tell you what building

808
00:41:16,630 --> 00:41:20,450
its managing rates of a picture of it
saying hey this is the building

809
00:41:20,450 --> 00:41:23,670
that's being manager and thats address
so if you want to stand across really

810
00:41:23,670 --> 00:41:24,430
liked this is

811
00:41:24,430 --> 00:41:27,630
awesome you could do that if you want to
you right

812
00:41:27,630 --> 00:41:30,849
I want to get its for user-friendly

813
00:41:30,849 --> 00:41:34,900
slow where

814
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:38,960
things here

815
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:42,960
i guess its Java so X while tried to
live his

816
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:48,240
Missy exist

817
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:51,950
a your just take time

818
00:41:51,950 --> 00:41:55,490
yet all these have like I am low
animations and set the kinda tell you

819
00:41:55,490 --> 00:41:57,430
what's going on

820
00:41:57,430 --> 00:42:04,430
see

821
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:12,520
soda pops skin

822
00:42:23,410 --> 00:42:27,040
so once again the user base is pretty
intuitive

823
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:31,540
and electoral to allow is they'll just
allow you basically the change came into

824
00:42:31,540 --> 00:42:32,120
the bottom

825
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:35,490
right sir if I hover over the saying not
a click it

826
00:42:35,490 --> 00:42:38,920
over rehearsing you like to see that
their buttons

827
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:42,590
right and so this is how an operator
real engineer

828
00:42:42,590 --> 00:42:47,700
would actually manage a building right
so so if you put your building on line

829
00:42:47,700 --> 00:42:49,430
to the internet without notification

830
00:42:49,430 --> 00:42:53,280
anyone can manager building it's pretty
simple

831
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:57,430
from I'll take a larger in a second

832
00:42:57,430 --> 00:43:01,000
on the supreme court to decide punctual

833
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:05,890
listing so alarms in most cases when you
see the word alarm in a building

834
00:43:05,890 --> 00:43:06,820
management system

835
00:43:06,820 --> 00:43:11,480
it's not like a physical on its gonna go
off what folks usually do is all set

836
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:14,820
up a criteria to be notified for
something

837
00:43:14,820 --> 00:43:18,170
that's considered a warm so if the
temperature gets too high

838
00:43:18,170 --> 00:43:21,790
or for temperature goes too low or
something is turned off by the time it

839
00:43:21,790 --> 00:43:22,740
was he turned on

840
00:43:22,740 --> 00:43:26,740
they can create in a war and so will
happen is if the criteria is met

841
00:43:26,740 --> 00:43:29,920
I'm either some gets an SMS message or
phone call or something like that

842
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:33,390
I know an alarm goes off so we see the
word alarm

843
00:43:33,390 --> 00:43:36,510
it's not usually like a real physical
alarm going off it's just like a Sep

844
00:43:36,510 --> 00:43:40,000
yeah so this is pretty cool I once again
you can make

845
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:43,000
hover over command so if you one click
that thing

846
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:46,630
you turn the pump on rights priest
report the way that is this actually

847
00:43:46,630 --> 00:43:48,320
works as they could this interface

848
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:51,810
if you click this button it passes a
command to the underlying framework the

849
00:43:51,810 --> 00:43:53,060
framework basically translates

850
00:43:53,060 --> 00:43:56,510
translates that too whatever protocols
attached actual device

851
00:43:56,510 --> 00:43:59,580
well thats back matter mod bus or some
other custom protocol

852
00:43:59,580 --> 00:44:02,640
and it sends out to the device that's
listening in this in this case would be

853
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:03,520
some kinda pop

854
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:07,110
and then the pump understand that
protocol he returns on or just a set

855
00:44:07,110 --> 00:44:07,530
point

856
00:44:07,530 --> 00:44:11,620
response back saying hey I'm on now and
then this user to fish displays in a

857
00:44:11,620 --> 00:44:12,220
nice way

858
00:44:12,220 --> 00:44:15,280
so that's all this user interface is
doing so if you understand underlying

859
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:16,160
protocols

860
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:19,170
you actually jump to the underlying
system until the device do whatever you

861
00:44:19,170 --> 00:44:19,580
want

862
00:44:19,580 --> 00:44:23,360
right so in this case there's only one
command really write like turn off and

863
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:23,800
turn

864
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:26,810
right but if you wanted to you could
jump to the underlying device it's a

865
00:44:26,810 --> 00:44:28,460
turn on its been really fast

866
00:44:28,460 --> 00:44:32,480
or or don't ever turn on ever getting
were or right next play against the vice

867
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:33,230
compelling you

868
00:44:33,230 --> 00:44:36,280
device are not very robust are not meant
to be messed with

869
00:44:36,280 --> 00:44:39,380
anyways

870
00:44:39,380 --> 00:44:43,190
see is also a cool other chilled water
system it just kinda shows you what's

871
00:44:43,190 --> 00:44:43,990
going on of

872
00:44:43,990 --> 00:44:47,610
enable status is and then I want to load
up one other one here

873
00:44:47,610 --> 00:44:51,250
this were here so here's one lights
writers and playwrights

874
00:44:51,250 --> 00:44:54,260
here customer lights outdoor lights

875
00:44:54,260 --> 00:44:58,620
this one also actually as energy manager
as well right in turn power on

876
00:44:58,620 --> 00:45:02,130
first so a billy medicines look like

877
00:45:02,130 --> 00:45:06,230
right tell you right now your fortune
1000 their corporate building

878
00:45:06,230 --> 00:45:09,890
their corporate campus at the system
somewhere tell you right now you have

879
00:45:09,890 --> 00:45:10,770
this is a summer

880
00:45:10,770 --> 00:45:14,000
of we're not want these guys are we
pulled out that has no authentication to

881
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:14,450
theirs

882
00:45:14,450 --> 00:45:18,140
but you could be traffic so I hope
you're not

883
00:45:18,140 --> 00:45:23,330
so from okay

884
00:45:23,330 --> 00:45:26,610
so

885
00:45:26,610 --> 00:45:29,880
little about access control systems her
democrats access control system

886
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:32,950
I'm not to show it is vendor ask nicely
in was

887
00:45:32,950 --> 00:45:37,150
pretty proactive and 9.6 I will talk
about 10 apiece to but i wanna talk

888
00:45:37,150 --> 00:45:38,760
about the systems in general so

889
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:42,060
for the most part with you access
control

890
00:45:42,060 --> 00:45:45,780
real about these devices right like you
bad into a door someplace that doesn't

891
00:45:45,780 --> 00:45:46,490
signaling

892
00:45:46,490 --> 00:45:50,460
it try to identify who you are incensed
actors device and then a door magically

893
00:45:50,460 --> 00:45:51,100
a box

894
00:45:51,100 --> 00:45:55,420
it's pretty cool so I get had access to
quality systems here

895
00:45:55,420 --> 00:45:58,850
I thought this was really cool right
because you put your hand on it and the

896
00:45:58,850 --> 00:45:59,770
new badge in

897
00:45:59,770 --> 00:46:03,240
it checks that that's if it's the right
badge for Haitian workers stole your

898
00:46:03,240 --> 00:46:04,290
bachelorette sir

899
00:46:04,290 --> 00:46:07,810
and then it basically Rieger and
Princess I S three Billy we should let

900
00:46:07,810 --> 00:46:08,360
them in

901
00:46:08,360 --> 00:46:12,910
so the crazy thing about it is
everything or these devices

902
00:46:12,910 --> 00:46:16,090
can be open with tacky said for

903
00:46:16,090 --> 00:46:20,530
yeah that key right there so other key
cost like $6 dollars

904
00:46:20,530 --> 00:46:24,750
so yet so super expensive I know it's
probably our most people's price range

905
00:46:24,750 --> 00:46:27,830
I but you really want to get access to
some unease doors

906
00:46:27,830 --> 00:46:31,010
my view my penis right so and so

907
00:46:31,010 --> 00:46:33,800
if you actually pull this thing off the
wall you'll see that there is not a

908
00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:35,640
magical unicorn they're making a
decision

909
00:46:35,640 --> 00:46:39,410
as to what should happen said they're
just wires right and so and

910
00:46:39,410 --> 00:46:42,330
this is kinda hard at it right the
billing agent systems what you are very

911
00:46:42,330 --> 00:46:43,090
intimidated by them

912
00:46:43,090 --> 00:46:47,380
attended a religious computers PK or
networks maybe

913
00:46:47,380 --> 00:46:50,630
using reporter calls or weird you look
alike your networks but

914
00:46:50,630 --> 00:46:54,610
its religious computer works so and this
one has like a

915
00:46:54,610 --> 00:46:58,150
this is the reason I have a strange I
here's actually kinda described what

916
00:46:58,150 --> 00:47:01,480
is going on here right so for the most
part

917
00:47:01,480 --> 00:47:05,180
I'm all that's happening is what the
decision is made usually not by the

918
00:47:05,180 --> 00:47:08,550
using up a system selves they can make
the decision by themselves

919
00:47:08,550 --> 00:47:11,790
can ever user database on actual device
itself

920
00:47:11,790 --> 00:47:14,760
button for the most part they don't do
that for the most part the decisions

921
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:16,280
action it somewhere else right

922
00:47:16,280 --> 00:47:19,290
officially single get set back saying
yeah you should let them in

923
00:47:19,290 --> 00:47:23,510
I'm in some weird cases were maybe ever
remote station it's way for of

924
00:47:23,510 --> 00:47:26,830
and the user list as a change very often
you catch it but usually on the device

925
00:47:26,830 --> 00:47:27,640
itself

926
00:47:27,640 --> 00:47:31,110
but that usually not the case right and
if we look at some other wires here like

927
00:47:31,110 --> 00:47:32,090
the outputs

928
00:47:32,090 --> 00:47:35,440
wire 5&6 basic control door lock

929
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:38,960
that says simple as that so usually it's
just about applying right

930
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:42,180
portage to the right wire if you up as

931
00:47:42,180 --> 00:47:45,200
access rick Scott this License
permitting

932
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:49,110
so I'm in a simplified way if you go to
a

933
00:47:49,110 --> 00:47:52,300
like a bad thing says or something like
that and your badge in

934
00:47:52,300 --> 00:47:55,430
what could happen as either over cereal
or IP

935
00:47:55,430 --> 00:47:58,620
a signals gonna get sent to compare say
I hate this person dispatched

936
00:47:58,620 --> 00:48:01,520
and this is their number and use the
application servers can look up on a day

937
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:04,090
to day saying hey does this person
exists in my database

938
00:48:04,090 --> 00:48:07,690
and what are the authorized to access to
send it back to the applications are

939
00:48:07,690 --> 00:48:08,410
saying

940
00:48:08,410 --> 00:48:12,530
is these are the permissions for that
particular user right and then

941
00:48:12,530 --> 00:48:16,220
back or sure your IP is to send the
signal back to the device a

942
00:48:16,220 --> 00:48:19,840
this is what we know about this person
are and then the device actually to

943
00:48:19,840 --> 00:48:20,430
supplies

944
00:48:20,430 --> 00:48:23,630
your voltage to a particular lock and
says locker locker

945
00:48:23,630 --> 00:48:27,610
so usually five orchard art wobbles
pressured

946
00:48:27,610 --> 00:48:31,870
so physical access trumps everything
right so if you go to a batting system

947
00:48:31,870 --> 00:48:33,220
and pull off a wall

948
00:48:33,220 --> 00:48:36,730
there should be a wire behind it right
not your comments just a wire

949
00:48:36,730 --> 00:48:40,770
so and typically some others wire tracks
gonna go to the lock

950
00:48:40,770 --> 00:48:44,850
and usually just fire 12 volt apply to
that wire that's going to open that walk

951
00:48:44,850 --> 00:48:48,420
or sometimes too sir a reply cuz the
door may have a controller itself

952
00:48:48,420 --> 00:48:53,620
right so control connector or so I'm
obviously require Cisco access

953
00:48:53,620 --> 00:48:57,940
and then this user cars 2 similar device
for use at the ticket price of the wall

954
00:48:57,940 --> 00:49:01,920
on so you have to really care for
whatever large is these manufactures no

955
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:05,420
that if you take the device of the long
get can access the wires it's basically

956
00:49:05,420 --> 00:49:06,070
every defeat

957
00:49:06,070 --> 00:49:09,550
so I don't have temporal arms for if you
pull the device off the wall

958
00:49:09,550 --> 00:49:12,770
or like like I did when I marked the
device itself

959
00:49:12,770 --> 00:49:15,330
it actually has a temper mechanism else
in the signal to the application server

960
00:49:15,330 --> 00:49:16,260
saying hey

961
00:49:16,260 --> 00:49:20,560
someone just marked lanes open your
future

962
00:49:20,560 --> 00:49:23,600
I'm typically install a Windows machines
this application server itself

963
00:49:23,600 --> 00:49:27,300
right so probably the most popular
access control software

964
00:49:27,300 --> 00:49:31,810
are these three here right with the top
one probably the most popular access

965
00:49:31,810 --> 00:49:32,500
control

966
00:49:32,500 --> 00:49:36,530
sus never see secure right Dept a wide
divergence

967
00:49:36,530 --> 00:49:42,440
every data center that ever been to you
you secure ever so their servant

968
00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:46,350
I'm so if you're doing it you're a pen
test and you basically want to gain

969
00:49:46,350 --> 00:49:48,630
access to some the system for you wanna
gain access to some

970
00:49:48,630 --> 00:49:52,450
or someplace urging XO data center
whatever it is a fiscal sanity in

971
00:49:52,450 --> 00:49:55,740
in and play I must say you have
something like two main admin

972
00:49:55,740 --> 00:49:59,530
this is how you would find so we find 60
we know it and install kies

973
00:49:59,530 --> 00:50:02,640
are for these devices itself we have
privilege creds

974
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:05,660
we can to say I hate tell me where this
thing is installed and

975
00:50:05,660 --> 00:50:09,460
it'll tell us okay there's a secure
database installed on this particular

976
00:50:09,460 --> 00:50:13,140
machine here and they want to get access
to machine once again it's a human

977
00:50:13,140 --> 00:50:14,130
machine interface

978
00:50:14,130 --> 00:50:17,440
it looks just like this rights this is a
secure

979
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:20,510
or actions are this is Dora sorry
carrier

980
00:50:20,510 --> 00:50:24,040
so are when you want when i unlock
something Israel we actually did this

981
00:50:24,040 --> 00:50:27,730
during like a fantastical contest you
relate to select the door

982
00:50:27,730 --> 00:50:31,360
you want click unlock could Seattle
topic you it's pretty cool

983
00:50:31,360 --> 00:50:34,570
so you have to understand underlying for
recording like that although if you're

984
00:50:34,570 --> 00:50:35,200
really

985
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:38,720
you could understand Wipro want to send
yourself or you can get access

986
00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:42,620
you impress your mic button and the door
unlocked so

987
00:50:42,620 --> 00:50:45,640
I'm experts vertical I'm adding road
users

988
00:50:45,640 --> 00:50:49,750
that a particular group she's a pretty
difficult to detect

989
00:50:49,750 --> 00:50:52,820
what people are looking for mister so

990
00:50:52,820 --> 00:50:55,890
I'm just some basic general operation
about secure like I said that's probably

991
00:50:55,890 --> 00:50:56,570
most

992
00:50:56,570 --> 00:51:00,930
if you know if your fortune 1000 playoff
secure probably

993
00:51:00,930 --> 00:51:04,610
I'm says progress that state a better
measure out so if you find a single

994
00:51:04,610 --> 00:51:05,550
server

995
00:51:05,550 --> 00:51:08,550
SS progress account somewhere tables or
chairs second

996
00:51:08,550 --> 00:51:12,040
our like secure sequel that's that
default database name

997
00:51:12,040 --> 00:51:16,050
I'm that party secure database server
that means that is controlling access

998
00:51:16,050 --> 00:51:16,830
control sir

999
00:51:16,830 --> 00:51:20,660
facility to get if you own that database
you basically an all access control

1000
00:51:20,660 --> 00:51:22,050
facility

1001
00:51:22,050 --> 00:51:26,190
so for Carrie there could be at there
could be a file

1002
00:51:26,190 --> 00:51:30,430
for carried or not net I'm or to be in a
database the database the names usually

1003
00:51:30,430 --> 00:51:31,580
DHS

1004
00:51:31,580 --> 00:51:34,960
underscore main and usually is when its
authentication writes it doesn't have

1005
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:35,660
its own account

1006
00:51:35,660 --> 00:51:38,930
uses is usually is when I saw but you
can change

1007
00:51:38,930 --> 00:51:43,310
force so data structures kinda
complicated so this is the restructure

1008
00:51:43,310 --> 00:51:45,710
from a secure database the back and

1009
00:51:45,710 --> 00:51:48,900
so it's toward a lot of different things
right but probably most interesting to

1010
00:51:48,900 --> 00:51:49,700
us

1011
00:51:49,700 --> 00:51:52,980
I'm or the tea cart which is the card
information

1012
00:51:52,980 --> 00:51:55,480
the journal which is basically
everything that's going on and the

1013
00:51:55,480 --> 00:51:56,580
person right

1014
00:51:56,580 --> 00:51:59,720
I'm and also person has all the card
numbers and a particular pin for that

1015
00:51:59,720 --> 00:52:00,520
card

1016
00:52:00,520 --> 00:52:03,800
so Australia Davis free

1017
00:52:03,800 --> 00:52:07,460
creates so I'm were getting real close
here

1018
00:52:07,460 --> 00:52:11,720
so if you ask yourself hey I want to
audit my organization

1019
00:52:11,720 --> 00:52:15,270
where do I start right so would give you
the shirt and stuff you can go do that

1020
00:52:15,270 --> 00:52:16,020
right now

1021
00:52:16,020 --> 00:52:19,590
and look for your organization on mine
yessir protocols

1022
00:52:19,590 --> 00:52:22,850
the back that scanners gonna be actually
sorry out so you can go down with that

1023
00:52:22,850 --> 00:52:24,080
sir and mapping stuff

1024
00:52:24,080 --> 00:52:27,120
try to find some so image systems on the
Internet already

1025
00:52:27,120 --> 00:52:30,790
internal network I'm or what I like to
do you

1026
00:52:30,790 --> 00:52:35,090
is go shower facilities Department so
cancel our times this is not run by it.

1027
00:52:35,090 --> 00:52:38,540
such a reminder Solis Department and say
we're

1028
00:52:38,540 --> 00:52:43,260
or are truly in boxes right where are my
just extra boxes were my army logic

1029
00:52:43,260 --> 00:52:46,760
which might help controls and have them
tell you where the stuff is

1030
00:52:46,760 --> 00:52:50,070
or give you the software's to take a
look at it things like that

1031
00:52:50,070 --> 00:52:53,820
cool stuff does our facility management
systems

1032
00:52:53,820 --> 00:52:58,380
probably using workers I'm if you want
access control stuff

1033
00:52:58,380 --> 00:53:02,560
culture physical security folks and said
a saying hey can access control

1034
00:53:02,560 --> 00:53:06,380
to say wears a secure Davis wears a
secure software

1035
00:53:06,380 --> 00:53:09,640
I wanna see I wanna take a look at it or
was a license cuz I wanna auditor to

1036
00:53:09,640 --> 00:53:10,450
wherever

1037
00:53:10,450 --> 00:53:14,340
or cherry or shot right and hands

1038
00:53:14,340 --> 00:53:17,340
work you have to meet at a privilege to
a tragic end to scan for the

1039
00:53:17,340 --> 00:53:21,270
across a surgery given site sir so for
the surveillance systems has got three

1040
00:53:21,270 --> 00:53:24,610
pictures systems that you ask for

1041
00:53:24,610 --> 00:53:28,600
but the best people to ask are your
datacenter folks they have everything

1042
00:53:28,600 --> 00:53:31,770
their everything you can imagine that
actually measure systems

1043
00:53:31,770 --> 00:53:35,100
the access control systems that energy
medicines everything

1044
00:53:35,100 --> 00:53:38,590
so if you get your datacenter okay I
wanna take a look at all this offer

1045
00:53:38,590 --> 00:53:43,770
they probably haven't they prolly avid
but just asked nicely

1046
00:53:43,770 --> 00:53:47,490
so I do I take some questions

1047
00:53:47,490 --> 00:53:53,750
questions

1048
00:53:53,750 --> 00:53:56,760
but that's hard so

1049
00:53:56,760 --> 00:54:00,630
I'm that there is one thing to kinda
keep in mind right so

1050
00:54:00,630 --> 00:54:04,150
the attacks Ackley control the so I'm

1051
00:54:04,150 --> 00:54:07,940
that's a really good question one thing
to keep in mind is

1052
00:54:07,940 --> 00:54:12,760
I was classified Billy manage systems
officially measured systems

1053
00:54:12,760 --> 00:54:16,319
as a ICS duster control systems right
sir

1054
00:54:16,319 --> 00:54:19,940
scan falls under ICS are and ICS

1055
00:54:19,940 --> 00:54:23,780
almost always controls a process so you
have computer systems and other systems

1056
00:54:23,780 --> 00:54:24,799
embedded systems

1057
00:54:24,799 --> 00:54:28,599
but they're there to control a process
right and so

1058
00:54:28,599 --> 00:54:32,069
undoing states offer mistakes is pretty
easy control C

1059
00:54:32,069 --> 00:54:35,210
doing a process mistake is is heart it's
not possible

1060
00:54:35,210 --> 00:54:39,690
so if you are on it in the system's and
you turn something on

1061
00:54:39,690 --> 00:54:44,920
I'll you can take that back is a
physical event has occurred someplace

1062
00:54:44,920 --> 00:54:48,180
right so you cannot undo that you can
turn it off but you may not

1063
00:54:48,180 --> 00:54:51,260
undo what that process at cost right so

1064
00:54:51,260 --> 00:54:54,470
if you are doing it. against the
system's you have to be really careful

1065
00:54:54,470 --> 00:54:55,309
about that

1066
00:54:55,309 --> 00:54:58,960
and you always have to understand that
at the interfaces

1067
00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:02,760
while looks very cartoonish and it looks
like it's looks very innocent

1068
00:55:02,760 --> 00:55:07,180
its actually controlling a process in
place so I'm if you turn on a boiler

1069
00:55:07,180 --> 00:55:11,410
like the the fires gonna get lit right
and you won't be able to make it through

1070
00:55:11,410 --> 00:55:11,740
like

1071
00:55:11,740 --> 00:55:14,869
I don't want you ever have done that
it's too late it's a process that

1072
00:55:14,869 --> 00:55:15,470
occurred

1073
00:55:15,470 --> 00:55:18,790
can't take it back it's on a PM we can
revert back to snapshot

1074
00:55:18,790 --> 00:55:22,670
rates a very good question always
controlled the process

1075
00:55:22,670 --> 00:55:29,670
shares was up heat on the back if the
office

1076
00:55:43,130 --> 00:55:45,120
that that's a good point on

1077
00:55:45,120 --> 00:55:50,570
usually when folks did you guys are the
question so the question was

1078
00:55:50,570 --> 00:55:54,210
it's likely that most but chief security
officers

1079
00:55:54,210 --> 00:55:57,760
don't understand that this are falls
under the purview essentially

1080
00:55:57,760 --> 00:56:00,790
so they don't understand that this is a
rest dealership to billings online

1081
00:56:00,790 --> 00:56:03,910
that are sure to find it there's no
software to manage the structure stuff

1082
00:56:03,910 --> 00:56:06,910
that's actually good question a really
good point because

1083
00:56:06,910 --> 00:56:09,980
using we talk to folks in like how can
we get a better handle

1084
00:56:09,980 --> 00:56:13,270
or officially management systems and how
we secure these things

1085
00:56:13,270 --> 00:56:16,380
do we need to change passwords and Mike
will the first step

1086
00:56:16,380 --> 00:56:20,160
mister organize your self in a way that
you can manage these things

1087
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:24,130
so the last couple sites that we had to
pay to talk to facilities guys go talk

1088
00:56:24,130 --> 00:56:25,420
to your physical security guys

1089
00:56:25,420 --> 00:56:29,300
good doctor data center folks I'm
usually what you have to understand is

1090
00:56:29,300 --> 00:56:33,840
who owns this from an administrative
standpoint is at the facility spokes

1091
00:56:33,840 --> 00:56:37,780
is an IT is it the physical security
folks is it your datacenter folks

1092
00:56:37,780 --> 00:56:42,360
because that matters Ryan yet to get
that done first so if you or

1093
00:56:42,360 --> 00:56:45,880
a security person in an IT department
and you walk into you

1094
00:56:45,880 --> 00:56:48,590
the data center or you walk into the
physical security department where you

1095
00:56:48,590 --> 00:56:49,410
walk into you

1096
00:56:49,410 --> 00:56:52,760
the Facilities Department say or do
these on it it's likely the report

1097
00:56:52,760 --> 00:56:54,460
someone else they will report to the

1098
00:56:54,460 --> 00:56:58,500
that's the CIO or maybe there you're
like the sea ESO may not be in their

1099
00:56:58,500 --> 00:56:59,160
direction

1100
00:56:59,160 --> 00:57:02,320
in a report to CEO right the facilities
guys

1101
00:57:02,320 --> 00:57:05,610
maybe sometimes airport to financial
ever write his corporate real estate

1102
00:57:05,610 --> 00:57:09,930
ever so that's a really good point so if
you want to get your arms around this

1103
00:57:09,930 --> 00:57:13,840
from a strategic perspective yet
organizer software

1104
00:57:13,840 --> 00:57:17,030
you have control these and in a way that
makes sense so

1105
00:57:17,030 --> 00:57:20,700
it may be under the sea ESO may be under
the CIO I don't know what that looks

1106
00:57:20,700 --> 00:57:21,740
like a reorganization

1107
00:57:21,740 --> 00:57:25,630
but you have to do something right
especially when a lot of the exposure is

1108
00:57:25,630 --> 00:57:26,830
created by third parties

1109
00:57:26,830 --> 00:57:30,490
like integrators aqui saw your billing
address is going to be an AT&T

1110
00:57:30,490 --> 00:57:34,500
IP address space someplace that's heart
to heart problem right so

1111
00:57:34,500 --> 00:57:37,610
good question so organizing yourself in
a way

1112
00:57:37,610 --> 00:57:41,900
to wear the person that does have
basically responsibility for these

1113
00:57:41,900 --> 00:57:43,650
billionaires is with this clear to them

1114
00:57:43,650 --> 00:57:46,890
that this falls under their
responsibility that is the first step

1115
00:57:46,890 --> 00:57:49,960
for you and technical stuff after a
strategic standpoint

1116
00:57:49,960 --> 00:57:53,840
that's the first step and then once you
have that in place interested they can

1117
00:57:53,840 --> 00:57:54,780
cut up on the play

1118
00:57:54,780 --> 00:57:59,140
you want to manage its thats so we have
seen some really interesting things

1119
00:57:59,140 --> 00:57:59,910
where

1120
00:57:59,910 --> 00:58:04,290
but the responsibility as shifted hands
so for example we go to some

1121
00:58:04,290 --> 00:58:05,680
organization I would say which one

1122
00:58:05,680 --> 00:58:09,970
and her like a um you know you have your
building as it is is online

1123
00:58:09,970 --> 00:58:13,920
and they're like are we no like I answer
atti IP address space

1124
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:17,550
like okay that's crazy and then they go
talk to the police auction like I i mean

1125
00:58:17,550 --> 00:58:19,080
about this all time right and then

1126
00:58:19,080 --> 00:58:23,560
IT folks CIO's like you guys don't have
a clue as to what you're doing

1127
00:58:23,560 --> 00:58:26,750
is our computer systems were taking them
over and so they

1128
00:58:26,750 --> 00:58:31,160
they took them over and they put them
into you they put them to the core party

1129
00:58:31,160 --> 00:58:31,690
space

1130
00:58:31,690 --> 00:58:35,010
but they put them under the corp it.
security policies

1131
00:58:35,010 --> 00:58:38,010
and then what they ended up finding is
like these devices

1132
00:58:38,010 --> 00:58:43,060
act really weird for example yet a
checkered shorts turning onto places are

1133
00:58:43,060 --> 00:58:44,340
like a nerd blacklists

1134
00:58:44,340 --> 00:58:47,340
you had like also to Internet activity
were like

1135
00:58:47,340 --> 00:58:50,860
on certain protocols are getting sent
over the Internet Ryan

1136
00:58:50,860 --> 00:58:53,860
and then they basically assets like to
these devices are used like now

1137
00:58:53,860 --> 00:58:57,330
visionary doing Ryan they didn't know
this is happening

1138
00:58:57,330 --> 00:59:01,570
because the responsibility was very
unclear so facilities is running these

1139
00:59:01,570 --> 00:59:02,160
things with

1140
00:59:02,160 --> 00:59:05,730
clearly servers someone's desk right
plug into some

1141
00:59:05,730 --> 00:59:09,850
comcast modem someplace to all the other
scrutiny that happens for

1142
00:59:09,850 --> 00:59:13,590
egress filtering and other stuff is
being missed rights

1143
00:59:13,590 --> 00:59:18,080
really good point don't push the buttons
on the internet facing

1144
00:59:18,080 --> 00:59:21,260
stuff so go to that these

1145
00:59:21,260 --> 00:59:28,260
anything else so

1146
00:59:29,120 --> 00:59:32,500
that's a good question out I don't know
like every buildings different

1147
00:59:32,500 --> 00:59:36,590
and so depending on the components that
are attached to you I don't know it

1148
00:59:36,590 --> 00:59:37,850
happened so I'm as

1149
00:59:37,850 --> 00:59:42,240
it's likely that your fans are under a
tractor boiler whatever

1150
00:59:42,240 --> 00:59:45,610
a bizarre probably different for every
single building so it's hard for me to

1151
00:59:45,610 --> 00:59:46,990
generalize just say well

1152
00:59:46,990 --> 00:59:50,260
get access to a boiler by do this I'm
what I'm thinking is

1153
00:59:50,260 --> 00:59:53,960
you probably have to have like access to
you yet the question should probably

1154
00:59:53,960 --> 00:59:54,740
more like

1155
00:59:54,740 --> 00:59:59,050
if you have access to disperse a pic
type equipment can figure in this way

1156
00:59:59,050 --> 01:00:03,220
what type of damage could you grade so
or laid out a certain configuration

1157
01:00:03,220 --> 01:00:03,910
whatever I'll

1158
01:00:03,910 --> 01:00:08,120
I don't know sir but we do have a
project that's we're gonna do this year

1159
01:00:08,120 --> 01:00:11,610
where we're working with an interpreter
on the east coast and the integrators

1160
01:00:11,610 --> 01:00:13,150
basically

1161
01:00:13,150 --> 01:00:16,150
it's pretty cool because they go into
new facilities

1162
01:00:16,150 --> 01:00:19,400
and they set up building at systems
right and if they rebel

1163
01:00:19,400 --> 01:00:22,800
all this all equipment and what they're
gonna actually do is set up that all

1164
01:00:22,800 --> 01:00:25,920
equipment into basically a fatal imagine
that work

1165
01:00:25,920 --> 01:00:29,470
and we're gonna try to see exactly what
it is that we can do like whether we can

1166
01:00:29,470 --> 01:00:31,050
set a boiler on fire

1167
01:00:31,050 --> 01:00:34,210
do christa breakers get you a tremendous

1168
01:00:34,210 --> 01:00:39,070
the Sep but on new if we have a comment
that thereafter away anywhere scrap

1169
01:00:39,070 --> 01:00:42,100
I don't have any problem a problems with
us doing damaged

1170
01:00:42,100 --> 01:00:45,390
systems rates question

1171
01:00:45,390 --> 01:00:48,890
I can tell you this the systems are not
designed to be

1172
01:00:48,890 --> 01:00:52,100
messed with so like your boilers that
robust

1173
01:00:52,100 --> 01:00:55,200
are and hopefully there's physical
strain mechanisms to prevent like

1174
01:00:55,200 --> 01:00:56,990
catastrophic damage

1175
01:00:56,990 --> 01:01:00,100
but I'm pretty confident like just being
able to just break it

1176
01:01:00,100 --> 01:01:03,750
are that's probably wealth and skip
three probably pretty easy

1177
01:01:03,750 --> 01:01:06,600
whether or not we can make said a
building on fire selector I don't know

1178
01:01:06,600 --> 01:01:07,990
that order to look at

1179
01:01:07,990 --> 01:01:11,510
this year Buy stores just breaking
equipment

1180
01:01:11,510 --> 01:01:14,960
pritchard can just break it you want you
what that means your business

1181
01:01:14,960 --> 01:01:18,150
I don't know at the Canton how your
business is used

1182
01:01:18,150 --> 01:01:25,150
systems

1183
01:01:30,140 --> 01:01:37,140
what like a can you read it repeat the
question

1184
01:01:44,750 --> 01:01:47,290
yep so that's a that's a good point

1185
01:01:47,290 --> 01:01:50,720
I think I am a lot of folks don't
realize that they're building measured

1186
01:01:50,720 --> 01:01:52,230
systems can be controlled remotely

1187
01:01:52,230 --> 01:01:55,750
so that the the biggest problems by
understanding that if you have a

1188
01:01:55,750 --> 01:01:57,020
building management system

1189
01:01:57,020 --> 01:02:00,290
it's probably likely that your
integrator is managing it remotely

1190
01:02:00,290 --> 01:02:03,660
so I mean that's why we see all these
going medicines on the Internet

1191
01:02:03,660 --> 01:02:07,070
like the corporations don't put on them
put them there themselves

1192
01:02:07,070 --> 01:02:11,420
the integrator puts put it there for
them so watched likely as if you want to

1193
01:02:11,420 --> 01:02:13,380
restrict Remote Manager to somebody
systems

1194
01:02:13,380 --> 01:02:15,950
you probably have to work with your
interpreter in fact we've seen every

1195
01:02:15,950 --> 01:02:16,760
single time is

1196
01:02:16,760 --> 01:02:20,250
that only organization the bank or
whatever

1197
01:02:20,250 --> 01:02:23,620
their ship the teller a greater like a
look you're not going to login to the

1198
01:02:23,620 --> 01:02:25,140
web interface or the Internet

1199
01:02:25,140 --> 01:02:28,640
you're gonna ask us for access to this
person specific segment

1200
01:02:28,640 --> 01:02:31,490
we're gonna allow for getting point in
time and then you're gonna tear a

1201
01:02:31,490 --> 01:02:33,090
management and when you're done

1202
01:02:33,090 --> 01:02:38,270
returned of so the interesting also they
can still do remote management but the

1203
01:02:38,270 --> 01:02:41,580
organization can now control the remote
management in a way that makes sense

1204
01:02:41,580 --> 01:02:48,580
them right so that's a good question
yeah

1205
01:02:49,720 --> 01:02:53,010
I mean attended the day you know what I
tell

1206
01:02:53,010 --> 01:02:56,880
integrators is like a VPN appliances
like a couple hundred dollars

1207
01:02:56,880 --> 01:03:00,420
you know I'm getting for your devices
because

1208
01:03:00,420 --> 01:03:04,080
in my opinion they're not robust enough
to be internet facing

1209
01:03:04,080 --> 01:03:07,250
even if you have all the security
mechanisms configurations done correctly

1210
01:03:07,250 --> 01:03:10,790
I V as obvious by the experts that we
have right so arm

1211
01:03:10,790 --> 01:03:14,500
I don't think having this thing on the
Internet is a good idea at all

1212
01:03:14,500 --> 01:03:19,970
well because we're

1213
01:03:19,970 --> 01:03:26,970
there's yeah

1214
01:03:35,330 --> 01:03:38,640
really that at this base is a question
of patch management

1215
01:03:38,640 --> 01:03:42,780
um lecture for example the trade in
Niagara boxes others back to throw the

1216
01:03:42,780 --> 01:03:44,360
water bill is that we have reported to
them

1217
01:03:44,360 --> 01:03:48,190
um if you look on the internet and you
do the enumeration

1218
01:03:48,190 --> 01:03:51,260
the boxes will tell you what version are
running you'll see that almost never

1219
01:03:51,260 --> 01:03:52,310
fully patched

1220
01:03:52,310 --> 01:03:55,730
so trip or and why that's the case

1221
01:03:55,730 --> 01:03:59,460
I don't know I don't know if it's
because does device are about facilities

1222
01:03:59,460 --> 01:04:02,440
whether they actually belong to an
integrator they're just being leased by

1223
01:04:02,440 --> 01:04:03,710
the end organization

1224
01:04:03,710 --> 01:04:07,490
or whether people just don't care I'm
not sure but the reality is that

1225
01:04:07,490 --> 01:04:10,710
if you find it if i sat on the rats by
not touched

1226
01:04:10,710 --> 01:04:15,370
if you find in your internal network
there's probably really not patched

1227
01:04:15,370 --> 01:04:21,220
ever fitzco to to do you like

1228
01:04:21,220 --> 01:04:28,110
disintegration in the first to yep so
the and map script

1229
01:04:28,110 --> 01:04:31,400
I'm downloaded from digital ones website
and then I'm

1230
01:04:31,400 --> 01:04:34,580
the Python trip to have that's actually
built into showed and now

1231
01:04:34,580 --> 01:04:38,230
so yet it's just the poor

1232
01:04:38,230 --> 01:04:42,280
you screw for the port port 1911 yeah
and you get a elicit a botched up

1233
01:04:42,280 --> 01:04:46,360
and then on john hasn't helped the guy
rancher Dan

1234
01:04:46,360 --> 01:04:50,870
he has a hooked up query capabilities
yet but he just court for that poor

1235
01:04:50,870 --> 01:04:54,640
I just don't everything that has as its
done unless it's Ken likable

1236
01:04:54,640 --> 01:04:59,570
yet ten twenty thousand devices and then

1237
01:04:59,570 --> 01:05:02,620
grip for your company a

1238
01:05:02,620 --> 01:05:08,610
I if there's a more questions thanks for
attending a really appreciate it so
