1
00:00:00,269 --> 00:00:05,430
thanks for showing up I am JP and I'm
hella tired talk about how easy it is to

2
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:07,669
build your own charge in hardware

3
00:00:07,669 --> 00:00:11,400
at home even if you're not a hardware
techie person

4
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:15,110
I like to think black hat Asia for
letting me speak this year

5
00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:18,869
this guy here I and the

6
00:00:18,869 --> 00:00:23,460
computer security consultant at found
stone and a mostly pen testing and all

7
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:24,210
kinds

8
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:28,070
I like to think of myself as a breaker
of things I'm not nearly as good at

9
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:29,869
fixing things as I am breaking them

10
00:00:29,869 --> 00:00:33,870
I my personal interest areas are like
wireless security

11
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:38,309
on portable my portable I mean like
little gadgets and things on a sailor

12
00:00:38,309 --> 00:00:40,860
quite mobile see here not phones and
stuff

13
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:43,910
I hardware which is the

14
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:49,059
new adventure for me um I learned all
this in the past two years I came up as

15
00:00:49,059 --> 00:00:50,360
a software guy so

16
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:53,270
just trying to come from the perspective
of people here they're not hardware

17
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:54,140
engineers

18
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:57,350
I didn't come from that side either but
I've been learning at

19
00:00:57,350 --> 00:01:02,480
and also physical security of couple the
projects that I've worked on

20
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:06,350
arquette on out as a multiboot USB flash
drive

21
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:10,450
and pay ranges like in wireless hacking
toolkit so much a Bluetooth hacking

22
00:01:10,450 --> 00:01:11,110
stuff

23
00:01:11,110 --> 00:01:15,310
and some hardware men talk about today
on smoking at

24
00:01:15,310 --> 00:01:20,040
some rather cons before likes this in
the US so I'm super excited to be here

25
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:21,979
in Singapore speaking a black and Asian

26
00:01:21,979 --> 00:01:25,979
to go the stock I'll I discuss

27
00:01:25,979 --> 00:01:29,470
building Trojan hardware at home and
we're very used to hearing the concept

28
00:01:29,470 --> 00:01:30,409
that the Trojan

29
00:01:30,409 --> 00:01:34,280
but going back you know many many
decades that's always been a software

30
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:37,890
side of things you always think I'm
downloading a file clicking on it an

31
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:39,579
ounce on your infected with the No

32
00:01:39,579 --> 00:01:43,119
something some sorta buzzword item I'll

33
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:46,680
big focus here is you do not need to be
keep and

34
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:50,420
emphasizing this fact I'll probably say
it again you don't need to be

35
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:53,970
you know super rare hardware hacker
person to perform these heights in the

36
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:54,560
tax

37
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:59,130
army we'll see sort how easy it is I'll
get a little bit technical but I'm gonna

38
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:00,509
try to stay a little bit on the

39
00:02:00,509 --> 00:02:05,549
a broader scope um I'm gonna try to
remain as platform neutral as possible

40
00:02:05,549 --> 00:02:08,360
I'm not targeting any specific vendor
here

41
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:13,120
as much as we'll be discussing types of
devices obviously I'm using

42
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:17,190
a yeah vendor item can ignore that
that's that's totally useless that is

43
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:18,989
not the information to take away from
this

44
00:02:18,989 --> 00:02:22,050
this is vendor-neutral us on a
discussion

45
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:25,670
and I want to show you how easy it is to
perform this hardware

46
00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:29,489
attacks against you know common everyday
things you find and home

47
00:02:29,489 --> 00:02:33,379
in the office on the market this stuff
you see the

48
00:02:33,379 --> 00:02:38,599
times the stuff you see in this room so
let's simplify her how many people here

49
00:02:38,599 --> 00:02:42,310
I mess with hardware either as a hobby
or professionally

50
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:45,450
okay I see about half a dozen hands

51
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:49,989
and that's what I really I am found in
the security field in general

52
00:02:49,989 --> 00:02:53,900
were a lot of Saron software people
where they came from programming

53
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:57,970
I T E some sort administration and then
moved into security

54
00:02:57,970 --> 00:03:01,580
and there's almost no people that have
done hardware and moved in the security

55
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:02,620
from there

56
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:06,120
a lot of people that have gone into it
like I have it's always been sort of a

57
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,319
curiosity

58
00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:11,140
hobby thing arm there's a the people out
there that came from hardware they're

59
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:12,010
doing security

60
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:16,110
but as a field it seems like the
hardware side a thing really gets

61
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:16,920
overlooked

62
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:21,860
so just gonna make it in a little simple
for you I am you break it down so it so

63
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:23,840
the highway doesn't seem so mysterious

64
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:27,640
so what do we normally have with PCB
board a printed circuit board

65
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:30,810
arm you got your tiny single-use
components like a

66
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:34,010
resistor now lady and crystal clock

67
00:03:34,010 --> 00:03:37,340
capacitors I'm you got some specialize
chips

68
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:42,150
like a ram maybe a controller like an
Ethernet controller USB controller that

69
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:46,379
all it does is interpret data from one
side to USB and back so it doesn't do

70
00:03:46,379 --> 00:03:47,510
lots of things

71
00:03:47,510 --> 00:03:51,140
you know your prime a processor which is
kinda you know the mothership

72
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:54,400
controls everything you've got here

73
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:58,560
input/output ports and this area
sometimes on the board themselves in a

74
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:01,420
inside and sometimes it's like your USB

75
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:04,900
Ethernet VGA audio all those are

76
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:09,650
you know information out information in
so reports and we also firmware

77
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:12,970
and this isn't necessarily strictly
physically hardware

78
00:04:12,970 --> 00:04:16,750
but almost everything all the devices we
use nowadays nothing is

79
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:21,130
the written like flashed on hardware
side a lot in this controlled by

80
00:04:21,130 --> 00:04:21,970
firmware

81
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:25,520
surrounding caps a firmware as hardware
today so we're talking a little bit

82
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,139
about the firmware side

83
00:04:27,139 --> 00:04:30,770
as well modify hardware

84
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:33,790
what do we need to like a look at Narita
get started

85
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:38,190
wanna see what's in the box I had become
obsessed with taking apart

86
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:42,449
everything I am by now on which is not
good cuz I'm very bad at putting it back

87
00:04:42,449 --> 00:04:43,280
together

88
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:46,280
I really curious open up a look at all
the parts and stuff and then it kinda

89
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:47,229
just sits there like

90
00:04:47,229 --> 00:04:50,310
that's mighty I sent to my TV that the
other

91
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:53,570
I kid you not my TV right now is
disassembled at home

92
00:04:53,570 --> 00:04:58,340
and so it's not that difficult either it
said that sometimes that's a good thing

93
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:01,580
to demystify hardware if you're not used
to seeing a PCB board

94
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:04,919
you open it up and it's like on a
similar lines going to %uh these parts

95
00:05:04,919 --> 00:05:07,919
and looks in a mysterious but then if
you can to break it down into its

96
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:11,729
actual components you care about is like
four points on their the main ship to

97
00:05:11,729 --> 00:05:13,759
know camelot on the other stuff

98
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:17,979
I'm so that helps demystify see open up
the box see what's in it

99
00:05:17,979 --> 00:05:21,270
even from the outside you know you have
to open up you can see

100
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:24,639
is USB connectors are you have a ps2
connector

101
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:28,940
rj-45 Ethernet adapter on the board you
might have things and if you're not hard

102
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:31,250
to remain to be familiar with these
sorts a

103
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:34,250
I O I'm protocols but you art

104
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:39,350
i squared C ISP I these are ones that
are used at a much lower level

105
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:43,590
then the user's Jenner interact with
sometimes inner chip communication

106
00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:44,850
occurs over this order

107
00:05:44,850 --> 00:05:49,090
standardize channels I what I suggest is
if you wanna play around with this get

108
00:05:49,090 --> 00:05:50,080
stuff cheap

109
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:54,639
don't don't buy things bag friends for
them as I do up constantly

110
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:58,430
I find them at their stores or use their
you know I keep more with

111
00:05:58,430 --> 00:06:01,840
with by missing keys is excellent for
per practiced

112
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:04,639
I and then you can see that the hard way
inside if you wanna get the new version

113
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:06,310
for an actual test

114
00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:10,669
now I i definite menu and cheap ebay
craigslist I'll wherever

115
00:06:10,669 --> 00:06:15,039
um what's the purpose of the hardware if
it's a thermostat

116
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:18,340
I don't really know if I care that I can
attack it I wanted that is a nine-game

117
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:21,330
anything's maybe look at the purpose and
the highway to see

118
00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:25,729
what sort of Electr you can possibly use
and how it interacts with the target

119
00:06:25,729 --> 00:06:29,960
is it is a wireless is a wired what
sorta you know USB Ethernet

120
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:34,280
what is the going over and the 11 terror
attacks that way

121
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:37,449
so we need to play llame I am on a Linux
guy

122
00:06:37,449 --> 00:06:40,550
there and big night and the next level
annex

123
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:44,400
but sometimes you just have to have
windows for I'm certain development

124
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,840
tools or your testing

125
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:49,889
this or two attacks against systems it's
good to have a development system

126
00:06:49,889 --> 00:06:53,669
and in that same sense should probably
for testing attacked its universal

127
00:06:53,669 --> 00:06:58,470
have been all the major OS is up there
again cheap target hardware

128
00:06:58,470 --> 00:07:02,280
why spend the money I love the
programmers to flash new firmware

129
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:05,789
are really cheap it's not something you
have to be a corporate

130
00:07:05,789 --> 00:07:09,449
in a giant to afford a development team
to get these things

131
00:07:09,449 --> 00:07:13,780
softwares free or open source community
the hardware's like forty dollars

132
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:16,970
depending on where you get it from some
time to learn it

133
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:21,449
the the charging device you like 10 dead
and obviously minions are very helpful

134
00:07:21,449 --> 00:07:25,970
when you're trying to do so mad science
projects

135
00:07:25,970 --> 00:07:30,240
ISO number one that's enough with USB
the attack vector I'll be talking about

136
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,120
most stuff today

137
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:38,289
um so this scenario let's hide are
militias little Trojan hardware

138
00:07:38,289 --> 00:07:42,069
inside I'm an existing common piece of
hardware

139
00:07:42,069 --> 00:07:45,180
and I we talk about stuff that you can
actually see I

140
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:49,020
got some stuff sitting up over here and
you can poke at it later on

141
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:52,129
are many many devices unit surprised how
many of them

142
00:07:52,129 --> 00:07:56,889
have said large open cavities is there
is open free spaces inside the device

143
00:07:56,889 --> 00:08:00,099
I you know your phone is billed as
compact as possible

144
00:08:00,099 --> 00:08:04,160
but your mouse it's not because you
don't wanna hold the mouse that that big

145
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,930
it could be that big but you don't wanna
hold an ethics and mouse

146
00:08:06,930 --> 00:08:10,020
as the console behan the electronics
inside a very

147
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:14,490
you know smaltz flout the bottom defined
as I been opening up everything that I

148
00:08:14,490 --> 00:08:15,160
own

149
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:19,550
a surprising number of places where the
cabbie is already open or you can cut

150
00:08:19,550 --> 00:08:22,979
out some plastic they really doesn't do
anything other than you know his plastic

151
00:08:22,979 --> 00:08:24,669
mold injected that way

152
00:08:24,669 --> 00:08:27,900
I'm to fit and other devices

153
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:31,800
you attack in the host device that is
connected to some really care about

154
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:35,550
targeting you know what i'm i'm buying I
wanna attack that the computer

155
00:08:35,550 --> 00:08:38,880
the time you know that that I would
assume that that target user

156
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:42,349
is plugging the device into and we'll
leave it functional

157
00:08:42,349 --> 00:08:45,680
so if it's a keyboard I wanna make it be
a key Workers a few

158
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:48,910
you know you modify and and its
malicious any plane and doesn't work as

159
00:08:48,910 --> 00:08:49,769
a keyword

160
00:08:49,769 --> 00:08:52,779
you got about 10 seconds before the
users like well

161
00:08:52,779 --> 00:08:56,320
I'll probably not thinking it's
malicious as much as why did I spend you

162
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:59,430
know ten fifteen dollars on this
keyboard is not working they unplug it

163
00:08:59,430 --> 00:09:02,640
should be back to throw it away or
whatever so we want to make it do

164
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:07,580
what it was intended to do plus our
little bit of fun

165
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:11,220
a to this end I I did a Kickstarter
project and I developed

166
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:15,839
I am an open source hardware platform
for this exact sort of attacks

167
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:19,850
if you're familiar are do you know the
people know what they're doing hours are

168
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:23,070
have some people here so it's an open
source very easy

169
00:09:23,070 --> 00:09:26,370
user base and for our hardware stuff not
just

170
00:09:26,370 --> 00:09:29,930
hardware hacking like security side but
did you know if you wanna get in her way

171
00:09:29,930 --> 00:09:31,820
at all it's a great platform to use

172
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:35,050
and there's a lot of different boards
out there but I wanted to develop one

173
00:09:35,050 --> 00:09:36,519
that was specific for

174
00:09:36,519 --> 00:09:40,560
the security community so I they know
how to add talk to friends and then

175
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:44,470
anything would be the easiest way to
make it accessible to the non hardware

176
00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:47,839
folk but also make a really useful for
for

177
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:51,480
security testing so it i doing a
compatible

178
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:55,320
I am i can incorporate a lot and other
hardware that's designed for doing this

179
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,110
stuff so

180
00:09:56,110 --> 00:09:59,450
acting like a Bluetooth adapter can be
added to it very easily

181
00:09:59,450 --> 00:10:03,990
and I wanted to make this project as
easy as possible for the non coder is an

182
00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:04,670
engineer's

183
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:08,740
again trying to bring an end to a larger
scope I'm so I was able to successfully

184
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:09,660
funded

185
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:14,089
last year and I'm really grateful about
that I'm so that the platform

186
00:10:14,089 --> 00:10:18,070
I want to make it easy so I'll most the
usual and integration is a micro SD card

187
00:10:18,070 --> 00:10:19,940
text files there's no

188
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:23,089
interact in front and you don't have to
write your own source code to compile it

189
00:10:23,089 --> 00:10:24,019
or anything

190
00:10:24,019 --> 00:10:27,300
it's all as the cards and Ipswich's

191
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:30,149
and I put the deaths was on there so you
can have lotsa different attacks in

192
00:10:30,149 --> 00:10:30,899
areas

193
00:10:30,899 --> 00:10:34,190
so we're not meeting at his plane into
computers that you want to attack

194
00:10:34,190 --> 00:10:39,930
you can has specific targets for when an
XP Windows 7 and server 8 OS X Linux

195
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:41,140
whatever you want

196
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:45,170
have them all on you at once
plug-and-play about the project's

197
00:10:45,170 --> 00:10:48,760
site at the end so you don't need a
write that down right now

198
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:52,440
we're going to focus on with the risky
struck injection so essentially the the

199
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:54,610
glitches able to emulate a keyboard

200
00:10:54,610 --> 00:10:58,720
on this functionality also exist for
other Arduino compatible devices

201
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:02,649
it so it's essentially once plugged and
it says on the keyboard computer and

202
00:11:02,649 --> 00:11:03,130
then keep

203
00:11:03,130 --> 00:11:06,790
computer goes cool and then start
sending the data

204
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:10,519
that's the same as data for you know you
sending packets and keystrokes

205
00:11:10,519 --> 00:11:14,880
and onto the target system so you
essentially make it into a keyboard so

206
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:17,649
it's gonna type of stuff even though the
users not typing things

207
00:11:17,649 --> 00:11:21,399
you're playing it out as if the keyboard
is typing I'm

208
00:11:21,399 --> 00:11:24,870
certain sort of attacks that we can set
up the nice thing about this sorta

209
00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:29,769
scenario is types very accurately at
times very very quickly have to slow it

210
00:11:29,769 --> 00:11:31,260
down most the time because

211
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:35,050
it can type faster than the computers
can buffer at so there's some

212
00:11:35,050 --> 00:11:38,209
some you now playing around have to do
with actual um

213
00:11:38,209 --> 00:11:41,510
timing and the hearing required so I can

214
00:11:41,510 --> 00:11:45,019
ship up they attacked a nice to somebody
tell them they won this

215
00:11:45,019 --> 00:11:48,440
awesome promotional and they plug in and
and I am me know

216
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:51,649
10,000 a thousand miles away and not be
anywhere near it

217
00:11:51,649 --> 00:11:55,200
or if I'm physically in the building I
can plug it into law class that's like a

218
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,300
five-second

219
00:11:56,300 --> 00:12:00,769
walk you know plug and you're gone and
you don't have to be around

220
00:12:00,769 --> 00:12:04,910
all for this or that attacks to take
place which is which is nice and handy

221
00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:08,110
works against anything when the keyword

222
00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:11,899
so even if you have USB host man on the
iPhone you know this could potentially

223
00:12:11,899 --> 00:12:13,649
do something against it

224
00:12:13,649 --> 00:12:16,769
as long as it accepts the keyboard
generic brand keyword

225
00:12:16,769 --> 00:12:19,769
you know the sort attacks will work
against the system

226
00:12:19,769 --> 00:12:23,709
which is nice and handy I run the
scripting language

227
00:12:23,709 --> 00:12:28,029
to be interpreted for this keystrokes so
because you can type in

228
00:12:28,029 --> 00:12:32,089
like it there's no ASCII character for F
38 had to write something that

229
00:12:32,089 --> 00:12:36,200
to be interpreted the say oh I want to
type out you know f3

230
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:39,800
on this a little bit a lot but the
language you'll see some examples

231
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:44,089
I'm actually just next others la
documentation online so I won't talk

232
00:12:44,089 --> 00:12:47,139
about the language too much but this is
a simple example

233
00:12:47,139 --> 00:12:50,920
on for animus computer linguists out
there can be many guests

234
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:55,990
what this does beer its and make me very
happy it's makin figure out what this

235
00:12:55,990 --> 00:12:58,120
does based on language syntax

236
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:04,430
they learn the last 10 seconds

237
00:13:04,430 --> 00:13:08,040
what and then

238
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:11,950
that's right yet gentlemen the front so
I runs notepad

239
00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:15,839
we're doing do we r which for Windows
curious here open the Run

240
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:19,600
had a notepad its inner pops up says
hello black and Asia

241
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:24,529
and then alt f4 closes at so I'm glad
that somebody within 15 seconds then

242
00:13:24,529 --> 00:13:27,329
this I've read that makes me feel good
that my languages

243
00:13:27,329 --> 00:13:31,399
somewhat syntactically easy it looks
very big red like a looks like you have

244
00:13:31,399 --> 00:13:32,720
the right a lot for it

245
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:36,970
I have a generator the you can point
click your way through all this

246
00:13:36,970 --> 00:13:40,029
other than typing out the word nope and
you can point like your way see you

247
00:13:40,029 --> 00:13:41,250
don't have to memorize

248
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:44,699
all this and get it exactly cracked
there's a generator for you makes things

249
00:13:44,699 --> 00:13:48,850
a lot easier okay so moving on from our
church inside so we set up our charging

250
00:13:48,850 --> 00:13:49,470
device

251
00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:53,079
to perform a tax on talk a little about
you know this exact scenario is later

252
00:13:53,079 --> 00:13:53,810
but say

253
00:13:53,810 --> 00:13:57,230
we learned enough we can set up our
device now what we will make it into a

254
00:13:57,230 --> 00:13:58,089
Trojan

255
00:13:58,089 --> 00:14:02,070
so let's take this super simple will
grab the the closest mouse to us that's

256
00:14:02,070 --> 00:14:02,940
used in

257
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:06,579
many you know corporate areas this is
just the one that happened upon

258
00:14:06,579 --> 00:14:10,360
a large-scale the first one from their
store the USB hub

259
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:15,190
and the glitch so the bottom two are
completely inconsequential what brand

260
00:14:15,190 --> 00:14:16,720
they are doesn't matter

261
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:20,240
is arguably an internet troll they just
happen to be a USB hub that's

262
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:23,860
small and a mouse step 1:

263
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:27,740
crack open the mouse I you can see the
different color PCB's is actually two

264
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:28,779
different nice

265
00:14:28,779 --> 00:14:32,370
I'm the reason I have been up here is
most minus

266
00:14:32,370 --> 00:14:35,199
you for them over you answer the one
screw popped right up and it's about

267
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:37,310
three or four second process

268
00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:40,980
actually too many want to grab that
mouse right there if you wanna

269
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:44,510
yes and pass it around don't still it
but otherwise its okay

270
00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:48,360
betsy that's okay if they if it

271
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:52,480
and also that so I will pass this whole
thing around I'm is a good size room for

272
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:53,630
that sorta thing

273
00:14:53,630 --> 00:14:57,440
but you don't don't it's okay if it's
all it's a twenty three pieces and it

274
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:00,029
comes back I'll be okay I won't be
heartbroken

275
00:15:00,029 --> 00:15:04,060
I just was yes he had some some hands-on
experience with that you can poke at it

276
00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:08,660
I a day so they're generally with a
mouse mister different options I there

277
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:13,110
and and most the time has to do with the
quality I into the USB pens are soldered

278
00:15:13,110 --> 00:15:14,260
to the motherboard

279
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:18,690
or there's a little connector connectors
are nice and easy for us non sono folk

280
00:15:18,690 --> 00:15:22,690
I and then you say you don't take it out
the little scroll mouse which I didn't

281
00:15:22,690 --> 00:15:23,839
get it because it falls out

282
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:28,209
all the time and I'm constantly the you
losing them I you take that I was in a

283
00:15:28,209 --> 00:15:29,570
minute just snaps in

284
00:15:29,570 --> 00:15:33,089
and you've got this large open cavity as
you can see many pass it around actually

285
00:15:33,089 --> 00:15:34,560
pass on the top and that

286
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:39,279
as well you can kind of cover it up just
to see thank you appreciate it

287
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:43,130
um a how much space is actually in there

288
00:15:43,130 --> 00:15:47,329
set to awesome little USB hub we don't
need a lot of the USB hub so we're gonna

289
00:15:47,329 --> 00:15:48,149
do is

290
00:15:48,149 --> 00:15:51,690
sever the connection from the hub to the
host computer

291
00:15:51,690 --> 00:15:56,750
will cut that or on solder actually we
don't really need to USB

292
00:15:56,750 --> 00:16:02,410
slaves %uh the the pace reaction plug in
your devices

293
00:16:02,410 --> 00:16:07,029
I'm you can keep more one under attack
saddam before as Akshay's the third one

294
00:16:07,029 --> 00:16:10,310
inserted a micro SD term USB adapter

295
00:16:10,310 --> 00:16:14,139
and mounted that disc perform a tax so I
would leverage the

296
00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:18,560
keystroke injection to mount a desk and
then copy files over or

297
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:22,250
you know execute things based on that
but in this there were just using that

298
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:22,620
this

299
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:26,440
single one to 12 points there well

300
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:29,740
kind of run saw two of them will leave
the other two there and cut off the very

301
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:31,699
end where you'd actually play again

302
00:16:31,699 --> 00:16:36,620
urea the you device to the USB hub this
all come together in a second

303
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:40,600
one thing that I I thought about this I
had this idea when I design that lets

304
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:44,490
I want to be in the naked in bed has an
MA if you see

305
00:16:44,490 --> 00:16:48,759
I when you have a this is a micro USB
connector which you used to program in

306
00:16:48,759 --> 00:16:49,920
iraq the device

307
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:53,290
I'm but it the adapters for micro USB to
USB

308
00:16:53,290 --> 00:16:57,480
are really long when you're looking at
this sort of scenario Blanton that it I

309
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:58,089
device

310
00:16:58,089 --> 00:17:02,180
it's almost makes it almost twice as
long the small soon after I found

311
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:05,959
is about makes it about twice as long so
it's almost the exact link to the ledge

312
00:17:05,959 --> 00:17:09,699
see you have something like two
centimeters it's like four

313
00:17:09,699 --> 00:17:14,120
and that's a lot of space so I added the
solder pads on the top

314
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:18,030
so as an alternative to the USB port you
can add these four lines

315
00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:22,049
but so you can either solid the other
hand there are plugged the Nano whatever

316
00:17:22,049 --> 00:17:25,030
I'm so that you know they're just wire
so they wrap around very easy and

317
00:17:25,030 --> 00:17:28,760
they're much easier to in bed and and
that sort of San area

318
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:32,789
so does say the little bit a soldering
here but it's not too terribly difficult

319
00:17:32,789 --> 00:17:36,190
and I do have some some step guides and
i cant Asian

320
00:17:36,190 --> 00:17:40,059
the really people that are familiar with
USB

321
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:45,100
and there's four wires and thankfully
this four wires are color-coded

322
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:48,130
lotta times with the sort of thing
you're you're cutting a liar

323
00:17:48,130 --> 00:17:51,510
and you have four wires if they're all
green you

324
00:17:51,510 --> 00:17:55,710
you have a lot of testing had a view but
with USB unless it's a really really

325
00:17:55,710 --> 00:17:57,309
poorly manufactured device

326
00:17:57,309 --> 00:18:01,280
it almost always follows the standard
unlike me because my white line is

327
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:01,760
yellow

328
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:06,080
but that was cuz that's when I had the
physically close is why they had to me

329
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:10,150
that's my excuse but normally if you cut
open a liar you pull back the calmer you

330
00:18:10,150 --> 00:18:12,059
see in the red white green and black

331
00:18:12,059 --> 00:18:15,440
and their assessing with a day lines so
makes it way easier

332
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:20,929
for us to match pairs up exactly has
they should go

333
00:18:20,929 --> 00:18:24,460
send the skin it's an area with
unplugged the little connect their

334
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:28,919
which is the the USB a cable unplugged
from the mouse

335
00:18:28,919 --> 00:18:33,370
cut it we're going to embed the side on
the right we're gonna connect to the USB

336
00:18:33,370 --> 00:18:33,929
hub

337
00:18:33,929 --> 00:18:38,960
side on the left the the USB hub cable
that's going to the computer

338
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:42,200
side on the left is the USB cable going
to back to

339
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:46,380
the the mouse and that makes sense a lot
more when I have my

340
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:49,400
child drawings on that um

341
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:52,590
that I made in paint as I'm not very
good

342
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:58,150
so this there are three real devices
rate Sep 19 in like 3-4 step two three

343
00:18:58,150 --> 00:18:58,870
and four

344
00:18:58,870 --> 00:19:02,220
altogether over several other
connections to connect things but you

345
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:03,289
can see

346
00:19:03,289 --> 00:19:06,299
the original USB cable now goes to the
hub

347
00:19:06,299 --> 00:19:10,630
the job is then connected to the glitz
and the mouse

348
00:19:10,630 --> 00:19:14,950
and then we put it all together and if
it's nice and happy in inside

349
00:19:14,950 --> 00:19:20,270
them the mouse the day comment on is it
a finance

350
00:19:20,270 --> 00:19:23,970
so that makes these convenient you now
in the No ship the mouse

351
00:19:23,970 --> 00:19:28,220
replace that swap it out using a common
hardware like that you just walk in

352
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:29,860
replacing the swap it out

353
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:33,799
I lotsa thing promotions are good you by
the nice big fancy

354
00:19:33,799 --> 00:19:37,410
mouse news hey you Danks for coming back
at you

355
00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:40,990
one this big prizes leadership tonight
sweetie pie and then

356
00:19:40,990 --> 00:19:44,320
don't do that anybody that would be that

357
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:47,620
the season so you get a mouse shipped to
you within the next month

358
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:52,160
you might want to crack it open first a
hacer so that's the San air from the

359
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:52,750
mouse

360
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:56,179
I and that's generally you know kinda
what I'm talking about here but I'm

361
00:19:56,179 --> 00:19:57,900
gonna go over a few out there

362
00:19:57,900 --> 00:20:01,710
doctors just the naked think the NSA
mine doesn't go I never buy a house

363
00:20:01,710 --> 00:20:02,799
again in months ago

364
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:07,190
I should never play again anything after
any that have been disassembled entirely

365
00:20:07,190 --> 00:20:10,510
to my home or corporate network lets it
is

366
00:20:10,510 --> 00:20:13,720
altogether I don't know how far it's
gotten around that

367
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:17,220
it's not very difficult to see when a
lot of cameras I

368
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:21,950
it got a little tiny hub that the glitch
I should probably shell that from

369
00:20:21,950 --> 00:20:26,710
the touching other parts in the liar but
I haven't and then you know your cable

370
00:20:26,710 --> 00:20:29,929
we're going out this way and then you
close all up in it some mouse that

371
00:20:29,929 --> 00:20:31,669
scrolls and works just fine in

372
00:20:31,669 --> 00:20:35,789
everything is is great and the little
icons on the bottom

373
00:20:35,789 --> 00:20:39,110
and it closes just find plenty of space
in this mouse

374
00:20:39,110 --> 00:20:42,880
the screw back the other and it's all
good

375
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:48,140
are some some payloads so up for this
sort of attack said you know when target

376
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:52,580
a specific LS doesn't even open the
command prompt ago shortly before the a

377
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:56,419
they are run dialogue is that the same
in in Linux or Windows

378
00:20:56,419 --> 00:21:00,110
or a a sax yes it's hard to answer some
a little bit

379
00:21:00,110 --> 00:21:03,470
comment I won't go into it but I've
actually made my firmware that I wrote

380
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:06,860
makes it super easy to target a specific
operating system

381
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:10,010
are you want to run once is so every
time it reboots

382
00:21:10,010 --> 00:21:14,610
it's not gonna perform the same attack I
at I will be updating my firmware

383
00:21:14,610 --> 00:21:20,100
soon to make it to that but time delays
love timings there's alotta this is very

384
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:23,270
vague when I talk about here and fortune
on have enough time to

385
00:21:23,270 --> 00:21:26,650
should walk through an entire attack but
maybe at the end

386
00:21:26,650 --> 00:21:30,750
we'll see if I can show you how one is
developed and then they can look normal

387
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:34,940
minutes back in the mouse should be out
%uh some attack scenarios

388
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:38,620
other side with the first one when the
first script I wrote

389
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:42,260
um we're good withdraw 13 right
everybody knows this is a cipher

390
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:46,220
your place a character %uh with a
character that's thirteen up from it so

391
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:47,409
you end up rotating

392
00:21:47,409 --> 00:21:50,590
the ASCII the american character set so
the

393
00:21:50,590 --> 00:21:54,429
the attack that I wrote is actually a
batch script because I want to use

394
00:21:54,429 --> 00:21:57,470
native resources I don't need to
download a file anything

395
00:21:57,470 --> 00:22:02,150
I it pops up but attack senator types
others that script saves it

396
00:22:02,150 --> 00:22:06,679
runs it it dropped 13 the other teens
all the files

397
00:22:06,679 --> 00:22:09,730
in my documents and then hide them

398
00:22:09,730 --> 00:22:13,030
so if you're not only is there any open
in my documents all you see are folders

399
00:22:13,030 --> 00:22:15,750
and every single file you have in your
filesystem

400
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:19,380
is now gone an ear even if you do and
hide it

401
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:22,830
they're all route 13 and the file
extensions are about thirteen

402
00:22:22,830 --> 00:22:26,830
see you have absolute know it opened
them and this is all just using batch

403
00:22:26,830 --> 00:22:30,370
this wasn't downloading this with
anything fancy and of course

404
00:22:30,370 --> 00:22:34,590
the scenario was if your roommates does
your aunt you plug this in

405
00:22:34,590 --> 00:22:37,950
and after a couple minutes they will pay
your rent

406
00:22:37,950 --> 00:22:41,380
or be very said that they lost pretty
much all the files

407
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:44,830
I can manually redoing this isn't really
not possible

408
00:22:44,830 --> 00:22:49,370
Island NRS kept I said the Don does
everything you you reroute 13 everything

409
00:22:49,370 --> 00:22:53,470
and unhide it but the more practical
scenarios and Windows you haven't

410
00:22:53,470 --> 00:22:56,510
TFTP server pop-up send some files back

411
00:22:56,510 --> 00:22:59,890
at a local user I reverse SSH

412
00:22:59,890 --> 00:23:04,250
I'm you can have a download files you
can actually type out binary

413
00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:07,730
I can copy a file by typing it out and
saving it

414
00:23:07,730 --> 00:23:11,500
so you type it out and hacks like this
the the scenario is

415
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:14,850
it's typed out and then reverted back to
binary and then executed

416
00:23:14,850 --> 00:23:20,010
and the glitch has that capability and
then Linux and Windows and OSX

417
00:23:20,010 --> 00:23:24,390
so that a lot I but I takes a long time
but in all converted back into a binary

418
00:23:24,390 --> 00:23:24,960
file

419
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:29,340
execute that anyway are shaped you 1
working on a website and download it

420
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:31,000
mean anything you can do with the
keyboard

421
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:35,549
at all is you can do here and I
challenge you to try to go a day without

422
00:23:35,549 --> 00:23:36,580
using a mouse

423
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:40,220
you'd be surprised at how well you can
get around any operating system

424
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:44,529
without mouth as a lot a function keys
in and you know maybe non common

425
00:23:44,529 --> 00:23:49,210
scenarios where using alt f3 or
something in that pops up these things

426
00:23:49,210 --> 00:23:53,070
and there's a lot you can do the minor
be aware just for the common keyword

427
00:23:53,070 --> 00:23:57,200
which is our necks in AM keyword taken
apart

428
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:01,200
lots more screws don't lose them you
always end up with like

429
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:04,860
one last year doesn't matter so every
time I open it up as one one more loss

430
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:06,380
crew

431
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:10,070
but you can see here %uh the white
surface area is actually

432
00:24:10,070 --> 00:24:13,690
when you're pressing down the key word
thats whats pressing on

433
00:24:13,690 --> 00:24:18,409
at the very top you see a built-in USB
hub super we have to buy one

434
00:24:18,409 --> 00:24:22,159
came in there they can apply we remove
the little keyboard thing

435
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:26,070
and that's a little bigger pass out but
it's a sheet metal so it's really easy

436
00:24:26,070 --> 00:24:26,860
to remove

437
00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:30,110
I N you know at the end you guys can
come can look at it

438
00:24:30,110 --> 00:24:33,450
I would so really this time is that a
betting our own USB have

439
00:24:33,450 --> 00:24:37,659
we can use the that no one that's
already built in

440
00:24:37,659 --> 00:24:42,409
which is nice and handy I unfortunately
we're gonna so disable that one

441
00:24:42,409 --> 00:24:45,409
and my thinking is most users you know

442
00:24:45,409 --> 00:24:49,150
I'll you generally if you're doing it
security testing you don't target

443
00:24:49,150 --> 00:24:52,890
the security aware you not going after
the IT guys

444
00:24:52,890 --> 00:24:56,140
directly not going after the security
personnel

445
00:24:56,140 --> 00:24:59,520
you're going after you know no knotted

446
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:02,580
generalize people but like marketing an
HR

447
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:05,900
business the big hit

448
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:09,539
the people that we try to govern as much
as possible

449
00:25:09,539 --> 00:25:14,370
arm dot not upper management so yes
security by T and operable management

450
00:25:14,370 --> 00:25:18,289
the Senate and the sea in the from the
name does or does the off-limits people

451
00:25:18,289 --> 00:25:21,360
um see it is a deal with it. so when
they play again

452
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:24,799
the keyboard and they want to use a
flash I but the you know the USB have in

453
00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:25,360
the back

454
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:29,500
and the plane and it doesn't work they
owe oh no

455
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:32,730
now then they played in the other 1a
worked there's not like

456
00:25:32,730 --> 00:25:36,529
they don't bring you up all the sudden
like whoa hold on I found the one USB

457
00:25:36,529 --> 00:25:37,640
port on the back in my

458
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:43,110
new keyboard doesn't work um let's you
know let's call on the the IR team

459
00:25:43,110 --> 00:25:47,289
not not really not a high snared
probably not going to happen

460
00:25:47,289 --> 00:25:50,330
so if one USB port is right on the back
that's fine they the

461
00:25:50,330 --> 00:25:53,380
the keyword self steny ya good

462
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:58,169
it's still going to work just fine and
in this case we avoid soldering at all

463
00:25:58,169 --> 00:25:59,059
to

464
00:25:59,059 --> 00:26:03,309
the the device so if we wanted to do
this attack

465
00:26:03,309 --> 00:26:06,380
in a I know if you're physically on site

466
00:26:06,380 --> 00:26:09,799
and you had a screw driver with you you
can for this hack without bringing

467
00:26:09,799 --> 00:26:15,289
a soldering iron with you cuz that
stands out sometimes

468
00:26:15,289 --> 00:26:18,700
I okay so we're going to do if you see

469
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:23,110
the back this the right image you see
the wires kinda coming into the

470
00:26:23,110 --> 00:26:26,120
this entire segment here this whole
board

471
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:29,770
all it is is two USB ports there's no
other stuff going on there

472
00:26:29,770 --> 00:26:33,929
so we know that all these wires are for
these two USB ports

473
00:26:33,929 --> 00:26:37,500
and there is this you know the same the
data liars power

474
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:41,960
and the ground the ground in the shared
amongst everything

475
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:45,049
so we don't to solder so we'll try to
leverage that

476
00:26:45,049 --> 00:26:48,120
with put more than put the border where
and I have to do

477
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:52,029
is there is the plug and then there's
the where the cable comes and there's

478
00:26:52,029 --> 00:26:53,279
strips wire

479
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:57,080
earth there that are going between the
two essentially little that the copper

480
00:26:57,080 --> 00:27:01,659
we'll just cut it with a knife that is
not a very advanced technique

481
00:27:01,659 --> 00:27:05,250
you just say anything sharp you scrape
it off and now we sever the connection

482
00:27:05,250 --> 00:27:07,090
so anything you find around

483
00:27:07,090 --> 00:27:10,370
where to cut that commentary you could
just cut the data

484
00:27:10,370 --> 00:27:14,360
so the plugin and the nice fancy lights
come on to the device but is doesn't do

485
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:15,419
anything

486
00:27:15,419 --> 00:27:19,220
that's only fine but in this case I just
cut at all simply get into that

487
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:20,789
particular USB port

488
00:27:20,789 --> 00:27:26,029
doesn't do anything and this is the
final result

489
00:27:26,029 --> 00:27:29,029
what I did he said base they took the
same 1i had before

490
00:27:29,029 --> 00:27:32,370
had the the wires soldered onto the top
the glitch

491
00:27:32,370 --> 00:27:35,830
and I shove them into the socket

492
00:27:35,830 --> 00:27:39,190
that's all it took so the connector has
um

493
00:27:39,190 --> 00:27:43,289
inside the connector there's the wires
that run and have all clamps

494
00:27:43,289 --> 00:27:47,220
and the says that the wire a clamp and
then all plastic chit

495
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:50,799
case I really cheap ass a case that's
very flexible you just take

496
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:54,630
the wire and which has a little bit and
exposed metal

497
00:27:54,630 --> 00:27:58,210
and shove it in and it touches the press
is hard enough

498
00:27:58,210 --> 00:28:03,090
against the plug was exists that it's
going to make a circuit so you can

499
00:28:03,090 --> 00:28:06,049
or the other so I don't have to do
anything other than you know something

500
00:28:06,049 --> 00:28:06,809
is hard and

501
00:28:06,809 --> 00:28:10,890
hope its not loose it's not a very like
advance stable technique but

502
00:28:10,890 --> 00:28:14,510
pushing and liars and hoping they don't
come loose or you know taping them or

503
00:28:14,510 --> 00:28:16,299
something like that that's that's what

504
00:28:16,299 --> 00:28:20,659
my life resorts to I don't really go
terribly that's what dates duct tape and

505
00:28:20,659 --> 00:28:21,640
only forty

506
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:25,159
by the way to go or in this case
probably electrical tape

507
00:28:25,159 --> 00:28:29,679
and non-conductive material so now we've
got a church in keyboard

508
00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:32,940
our put all that the other and up

509
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:37,029
skip the head we brought back the other
looks exactly again

510
00:28:37,029 --> 00:28:40,120
the same thing I didn't have the car
about any space

511
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:43,230
that space in their Fed just right

512
00:28:43,230 --> 00:28:47,520
is able to put the keyboard back the
other a menu and see it up there

513
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:50,620
it all fits very not nice and easy to do

514
00:28:50,620 --> 00:28:54,679
and again anybody come across with a USB
have built inside

515
00:28:54,679 --> 00:28:58,370
I'm making a mental list up I will make
like an actual this but I do like

516
00:28:58,370 --> 00:29:02,110
now go into stores and in the US like
Best Buy or something and I'm like who

517
00:29:02,110 --> 00:29:02,649
just

518
00:29:02,649 --> 00:29:06,230
yes yes I why did you put the USB have
in their I

519
00:29:06,230 --> 00:29:12,289
but around here it's a lot easier to to
find variety of them

520
00:29:12,289 --> 00:29:15,669
to move on to another one so so far a
take n

521
00:29:15,669 --> 00:29:19,750
my church in hardware and I've used a
negative this channel USB hub

522
00:29:19,750 --> 00:29:23,429
man in the middle with it I've used to
an existing

523
00:29:23,429 --> 00:29:26,799
USB hub inside to perform attack

524
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:30,640
in this case I'm going to be doing more
the man in the middle

525
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:34,690
I attack I embedded in the hardware

526
00:29:34,690 --> 00:29:38,070
so what I have here is a very old and

527
00:29:38,070 --> 00:29:41,190
very dusty I point-of-sale

528
00:29:41,190 --> 00:29:45,539
card system so this is the keyboard that
gets plugged into

529
00:29:45,539 --> 00:29:49,059
the hotel or me know retail store
whatever

530
00:29:49,059 --> 00:29:52,350
and you know when they're taking a
massive data and they scan it

531
00:29:52,350 --> 00:29:56,580
and if that the type anything in or at
that the scan anything in this one's a

532
00:29:56,580 --> 00:29:59,380
little old lot nowadays you have your
PIN pad version

533
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:03,000
I'm so this is more common sorta at
hotels now but a

534
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:06,399
you've got your card swipe and then you
know you got your keyboard

535
00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:10,399
and that gets plugged in to the point of
sale system what I'm doing here

536
00:30:10,399 --> 00:30:13,529
as you can see on the left and then it
looks weird that's actually the magnet

537
00:30:13,529 --> 00:30:14,830
used for the

538
00:30:14,830 --> 00:30:18,649
credit card reader are more the gift
card reader any sort of car this

539
00:30:18,649 --> 00:30:20,140
difference or two layers but

540
00:30:20,140 --> 00:30:23,909
there's a specific one use for know that
the financial stuff

541
00:30:23,909 --> 00:30:27,440
and then that's a really old ps2
keyboard which makes it convenient for

542
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:28,720
this scenario

543
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:32,450
because ps2 is easier for me to man the
middle

544
00:30:32,450 --> 00:30:36,220
then USB but USB is is also possible

545
00:30:36,220 --> 00:30:40,059
so with the other two things those two
things are good for us

546
00:30:40,059 --> 00:30:43,110
this also didn't involve any soldering
at all

547
00:30:43,110 --> 00:30:46,220
actually the glitch in here doesn't have
a little wire sticking out its all

548
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:47,340
straight up

549
00:30:47,340 --> 00:30:52,309
up plugging in things so we saw the pan
out so you can see the better here

550
00:30:52,309 --> 00:30:55,539
yen looking up us begin spinning about
you know

551
00:30:55,539 --> 00:30:59,029
two minutes on Wikipedia will tell you
what these lines are

552
00:30:59,029 --> 00:31:02,090
unfortunately the color-coding isn't as
good so black

553
00:31:02,090 --> 00:31:05,700
probably ground the estimate was just
testing

554
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:09,340
do I finally figured out what the what
which ones I went back and forth so

555
00:31:09,340 --> 00:31:09,700
there's

556
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:13,470
four lines again you can look it up I'm
not going to go through all the ps2

557
00:31:13,470 --> 00:31:17,659
connectors Anthony's the same thing is a
little better picture when I site now

558
00:31:17,659 --> 00:31:19,370
before you can see from the top

559
00:31:19,370 --> 00:31:23,450
when essentially gonna be shoving wires
directly in there when the other wires

560
00:31:23,450 --> 00:31:27,260
already exists

561
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:31,549
the and that's with that big national
things at the top is

562
00:31:31,549 --> 00:31:34,570
a we've got the four wires that are
coming

563
00:31:34,570 --> 00:31:38,399
from the glitch to the ps2 connector

564
00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:41,860
and the the wire there is no cable for
the ps2 connector

565
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:45,130
is chopped off McInnis than NY don't
care about it

566
00:31:45,130 --> 00:31:48,240
the only reason that I kept the little
are sticking out there

567
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:52,059
this kind it later I'm with it was
easier to something

568
00:31:52,059 --> 00:31:55,450
you know the connectors that is the
solder new ones on there

569
00:31:55,450 --> 00:31:58,960
so got the connector is going into the
back in the pledge that lets

570
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:02,019
reason the keywords me typing and stuff
it's like oh cool

571
00:32:02,019 --> 00:32:06,320
I've got keystrokes I can replay others
I education on now most the credit card

572
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:07,549
readers just type out

573
00:32:07,549 --> 00:32:11,149
ASCII code so it's not like when you
swipe a card something super secret

574
00:32:11,149 --> 00:32:11,990
happens

575
00:32:11,990 --> 00:32:16,130
he just swipe it and it types it out so
when he plugs into the point of sale

576
00:32:16,130 --> 00:32:17,340
system

577
00:32:17,340 --> 00:32:20,539
the it you so you know you click on a
window

578
00:32:20,539 --> 00:32:24,519
you gonna field and this types out the
stuff that needs so you're the credit

579
00:32:24,519 --> 00:32:26,659
card name or the the a.m

580
00:32:26,659 --> 00:32:30,000
the gift card name or whatever and the
pertinent information

581
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,039
all get just type then like at the
keyboard

582
00:32:33,039 --> 00:32:36,850
that's how it works so there's there's
no second everything going on there so

583
00:32:36,850 --> 00:32:37,190
the

584
00:32:37,190 --> 00:32:40,980
the case jokes my the keyboard or the
the card reader

585
00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:44,000
get sent to the glitch the issue then
interpret set

586
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:47,029
and send that out over USB so socially
it's like a

587
00:32:47,029 --> 00:32:51,899
US ps2 to USB converter but it's a drop
so I can record everything that's going

588
00:32:51,899 --> 00:32:53,620
on there

589
00:32:53,620 --> 00:32:57,870
Anne and you would close it up ship it
out there is in the top is in on this

590
00:32:57,870 --> 00:32:59,510
one is because it's

591
00:32:59,510 --> 00:33:02,559
horrible to back the other see you never
see the inside

592
00:33:02,559 --> 00:33:05,929
and this case are not think I might have
felt the tension is while your

593
00:33:05,929 --> 00:33:08,440
configuration is all urs from a micro SD
card

594
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:11,760
you can also say files to my Christie
card

595
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:16,059
there's no reason not to as read/write
access are you can also mount the

596
00:33:16,059 --> 00:33:19,090
the clutch as a storage device if you
want to

597
00:33:19,090 --> 00:33:22,360
um so this case it's you know if it's
got a four gig

598
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:25,490
micro SD card you can log for years

599
00:33:25,490 --> 00:33:29,870
if you want to and that's it this a
little better picture

600
00:33:29,870 --> 00:33:33,950
and what you got going on Little Liars
command from the connector

601
00:33:33,950 --> 00:33:38,510
Millett wrapping around going to the
glitch and then I got a USB connector

602
00:33:38,510 --> 00:33:40,750
and at the very top is where the the
cable

603
00:33:40,750 --> 00:33:44,100
kinda pops out so you got that coming
out you can see the mad

604
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:47,350
stripe card reader a little bit better
in that scenario

605
00:33:47,350 --> 00:33:51,490
and the top there when they look see no
kinda weird because the keyword not on

606
00:33:51,490 --> 00:33:52,799
it with the key word on their

607
00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:56,260
it looks like I did standard
point-of-sale system even though it's

608
00:33:56,260 --> 00:34:01,590
10-15 years old and for fun that spice
it up in at a Bluetooth adapter

609
00:34:01,590 --> 00:34:06,350
um so what I did hear is right now the
coach is set to

610
00:34:06,350 --> 00:34:10,399
don't bout all that information I find
over Bluetooth so when i connect to

611
00:34:10,399 --> 00:34:13,970
this a nice my laptop my phone or
whatever in all this print out

612
00:34:13,970 --> 00:34:14,560
everything

613
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:18,839
it's got going on I also I'ma let talk
and and worked with the

614
00:34:18,839 --> 00:34:23,329
launching attacks over Bluetooth to so
you know you not sending daily as much

615
00:34:23,329 --> 00:34:24,929
as you just command-and-control

616
00:34:24,929 --> 00:34:28,070
orderly to serve if you've done the
other scenarios and this can be done

617
00:34:28,070 --> 00:34:28,450
with

618
00:34:28,450 --> 00:34:32,300
you know that previous stuff i'm talking
about. if you know that you want to

619
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:33,829
launch the attack

620
00:34:33,829 --> 00:34:37,750
in a certain time frame and you're
physically around there you go over

621
00:34:37,750 --> 00:34:41,540
like to use an SMS tax there are
adapters for the sort of thing we can go

622
00:34:41,540 --> 00:34:42,190
over

623
00:34:42,190 --> 00:34:46,010
a cellular network you know you can pick
go when it's in the tax and it gets

624
00:34:46,010 --> 00:34:47,399
interpreted and then launches a

625
00:34:47,399 --> 00:34:50,659
but in this case I'm using Bluetooth
some just skating you know hitting and

626
00:34:50,659 --> 00:34:51,440
go and I'll

627
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:56,169
launched attack then by but here I'm
just I'm dumping the data

628
00:34:56,169 --> 00:35:00,099
so it'll go to whoever connects to it as
dump all their your information

629
00:35:00,099 --> 00:35:03,390
out pretty easily

630
00:35:03,390 --> 00:35:06,410
this is a very very simple one loss and
lawlessness re:

631
00:35:06,410 --> 00:35:10,070
idle have built their own dust-up

632
00:35:10,070 --> 00:35:14,369
that there's more than that come on
we're allowed nerds in here

633
00:35:14,369 --> 00:35:19,460
yeah shamed I'm so most s out you
probably know had this

634
00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:24,630
may make common port thats generally two
USB ports and there is that it exists so

635
00:35:24,630 --> 00:35:25,530
you can run

636
00:35:25,530 --> 00:35:28,619
a USB line to pretty much anywhere on
your case

637
00:35:28,619 --> 00:35:32,480
the motherboard has USB built then but
sometimes you want USB like in the front

638
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:33,560
of the case it's a pretty

639
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:36,599
common thing I'm so these ports exists

640
00:35:36,599 --> 00:35:40,200
22 had that's a all I did was baaaad

641
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:44,910
the generic USB turned for adapter which
is something that you find online

642
00:35:44,910 --> 00:35:48,250
very easy a USB to micro-usb

643
00:35:48,250 --> 00:35:51,410
and then glitch and I just plug it in
close it up

644
00:35:51,410 --> 00:35:54,859
walk away the yen this is that this is a
good one for

645
00:35:54,859 --> 00:35:58,859
you have two minutes scenario alone with
the system

646
00:35:58,859 --> 00:36:03,010
unscrew the one screw that's holding the
case on poppin opened plugin

647
00:36:03,010 --> 00:36:07,010
for that walk away anonymity timing and
everything set up in a large

648
00:36:07,010 --> 00:36:13,609
or you know you can resell it with us or
whatever

649
00:36:13,609 --> 00:36:18,369
so the user see talked a little bit this
is the his truck injection side

650
00:36:18,369 --> 00:36:21,720
what's the user gonna come across and
then see this interaction and like these

651
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:24,570
key stocks doing weird things are not
sure what's going on

652
00:36:24,570 --> 00:36:28,369
um just plan ahead think about again

653
00:36:28,369 --> 00:36:31,720
the non stairs type users are talking
about I

654
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:35,640
what's what works well for them if you
bring up a command prompt and the

655
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:37,510
command prompt two starts typing

656
00:36:37,510 --> 00:36:41,079
download a new driver air don't touch
keyboard for five minutes

657
00:36:41,079 --> 00:36:44,490
the is gonna be like I should get coffee
forty

658
00:36:44,490 --> 00:36:47,960
now they're not gonna do them well
that's weird command prompt

659
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:51,720
like that's 90 the hardware does funny
things computers are of me now

660
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:55,579
difficult so this is a problem is always
you have a little from the message the

661
00:36:55,579 --> 00:36:56,339
beginning

662
00:36:56,339 --> 00:36:59,420
they make okay I am I'm now they are no
go

663
00:36:59,420 --> 00:37:02,400
bathroom whenever a comeback and then it
does all that stuff in the command

664
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:04,470
prompt you have your launching the
attack

665
00:37:04,470 --> 00:37:07,960
and then add the exits and as far as
they know nothing has happened their

666
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:08,869
system

667
00:37:08,869 --> 00:37:12,690
in the front and hasn't changed unless
you change the backgrounder Liam website

668
00:37:12,690 --> 00:37:13,849
sup man uses

669
00:37:13,849 --> 00:37:17,440
don't know this artist up a lot because
in the background

670
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:20,960
shock and awe and that they'd they're
not observing most the time so that they

671
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:22,060
can get on

672
00:37:22,060 --> 00:37:25,730
you know their social media sites and
their email if you knew anything else

673
00:37:25,730 --> 00:37:29,900
your that's okay as long as they can get
those two things isn't here

674
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:33,470
author launched the attack once um

675
00:37:33,470 --> 00:37:36,960
it will not attack after that so that's
I'd mention this before with anything

676
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:39,050
and adding on their side doesn't solve
do that

677
00:37:39,050 --> 00:37:42,480
updating every single time you do with
the computer cuz they might catch on

678
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:44,270
eventually they're

679
00:37:44,270 --> 00:37:48,390
some things you can do to make it a
little bit still fear I you can clone so

680
00:37:48,390 --> 00:37:49,790
USB devices

681
00:37:49,790 --> 00:37:53,060
have ideas if you're familiar with the
mac address

682
00:37:53,060 --> 00:37:56,490
same concept except for its not unique
to each device

683
00:37:56,490 --> 00:38:01,099
I manufactures have their sign one that
you like a device level 1

684
00:38:01,099 --> 00:38:04,200
so it's the think it's this its eight
digits

685
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:07,250
um a text that is a thing is there

686
00:38:07,250 --> 00:38:11,180
that sanitary are so since the more we
can do if where um

687
00:38:11,180 --> 00:38:14,450
doing this from from whereas I have the
reef a I have to

688
00:38:14,450 --> 00:38:18,490
compiled the firmware from source for
this one as oppose the other ones we

689
00:38:18,490 --> 00:38:19,839
just can flash it

690
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:23,619
which you can emulate the exact same ID
so

691
00:38:23,619 --> 00:38:27,420
what you do is you plug in your USB
device see whether it's

692
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:30,579
ideas go to the code modified slightly

693
00:38:30,579 --> 00:38:34,930
and then compile and then your devices
AK the the glitz or other

694
00:38:34,930 --> 00:38:40,109
amended hardware appears to the computer
to be the exact same hardware

695
00:38:40,109 --> 00:38:43,970
even the drivers will load the same
everything looks pretty much the same

696
00:38:43,970 --> 00:38:47,880
and when you plug it in so even that pop
up it looks weird before

697
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:51,589
you might see some live in a vice is
installing now it's like the keyword

698
00:38:51,589 --> 00:38:54,670
ducky board mean that's really not gonna
the

699
00:38:54,670 --> 00:38:58,849
show up as something there are millions
set off any alarms

700
00:38:58,849 --> 00:39:02,820
and and we can make a at as planned the
attack may look normal

701
00:39:02,820 --> 00:39:06,950
wait a while so if they'd probably 10
things I'm working on now is

702
00:39:06,950 --> 00:39:10,339
user detection so if the mouse is a
moving anymore

703
00:39:10,339 --> 00:39:15,300
now the muse is going to use a mouse
every find that it's very it's very odd

704
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:19,170
the you have a mouse and said they're
not be using it tuning and attacked

705
00:39:19,170 --> 00:39:23,480
when the mouse is being used and wait
until it after five minutes then it's

706
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:23,890
whatever

707
00:39:23,890 --> 00:39:27,460
and then launch an attack you're almost
guaranteed that that the user is

708
00:39:27,460 --> 00:39:30,570
I'm not going to be there and that's
something then I'm working on now I

709
00:39:30,570 --> 00:39:33,550
haven't quite figured out the best route
to do that

710
00:39:33,550 --> 00:39:36,630
you guys have been here as any ideas
about that now please let me know I'd

711
00:39:36,630 --> 00:39:37,359
love to

712
00:39:37,359 --> 00:39:41,180
the chat with you and talk about that
some but I think the user detection side

713
00:39:41,180 --> 00:39:45,040
is is key for the sort of scenario

714
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:49,270
too long from the USB um a and these are
just some concepts for a few attack

715
00:39:49,270 --> 00:39:53,570
vectors I hope that you take away some a
broader scope above hardware

716
00:39:53,570 --> 00:39:58,829
a we'll talk about a Trojan browder so
doing charging USB a surcharge in outer

717
00:39:58,829 --> 00:40:02,829
so it got hardware which before was our
mouse or keyboard are

718
00:40:02,829 --> 00:40:08,319
point-of-sale reader whatever hiring is
a guardar Trojan device which is like a

719
00:40:08,319 --> 00:40:09,400
Trojan router

720
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:13,869
and I got the network the display into
so the method and I'll show them some

721
00:40:13,869 --> 00:40:16,119
pictures that'll make a little bit
easier

722
00:40:16,119 --> 00:40:19,450
conceptually we want to do has come
between

723
00:40:19,450 --> 00:40:23,430
the motherboard and the jack on the
backs are going to focus on wired

724
00:40:23,430 --> 00:40:24,710
connections

725
00:40:24,710 --> 00:40:28,880
I like we did with a USB before we cut
the lines

726
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:33,619
well I cut the lines place sanidad
network adapter on one side a network

727
00:40:33,619 --> 00:40:34,119
adapter

728
00:40:34,119 --> 00:40:38,369
on the other send the scenario we have
the device

729
00:40:38,369 --> 00:40:42,440
it's going to connect to our router our
router is going to have

730
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:47,089
be connected to the plugin that actually
on the outside at the case

731
00:40:47,089 --> 00:40:50,099
and then we're going to charge it I
using your USB

732
00:40:50,099 --> 00:40:53,400
as a scenario I have a USB powered a

733
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:58,230
%uh pub and that makes it really easy as
pie both USB ports are on the

734
00:40:58,230 --> 00:41:01,810
practically everything that has an
Ethernet jack now so it's really easy to

735
00:41:01,810 --> 00:41:04,760
find those this five votes that are
given the USB

736
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:09,390
inside the case you can tap on that to
power it it's a really big USB hub you

737
00:41:09,390 --> 00:41:10,440
can have to find some

738
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:14,990
are sorry if an ad our router you can
have to find some other way to the power

739
00:41:14,990 --> 00:41:16,000
the device so

740
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:19,710
getting small USB good stuff

741
00:41:19,710 --> 00:41:24,380
here since there's Ave ATV and a Blu ray
player

742
00:41:24,380 --> 00:41:28,319
and that i plug them into and this is
still very much in my

743
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:31,720
beta testing a it it's it's the scenario

744
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:35,760
I'm again I take everything apart Mike
night and then the USB attack against

745
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:36,329
that

746
00:41:36,329 --> 00:41:40,960
against the great players and really
work what else can I do

747
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:44,640
look this so much into space in there
have to be able to do something

748
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:47,780
so that's when I decided I should play
around with routers

749
00:41:47,780 --> 00:41:51,200
arm so I haven't actually broken this
because this is my TV in my bluray

750
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:51,650
player

751
00:41:51,650 --> 00:41:55,390
and i'd don't wanna break them so if you
may want to give me things the breakout

752
00:41:55,390 --> 00:41:56,700
be most appreciative

753
00:41:56,700 --> 00:42:00,680
but I don't really need that all my
equipment home to break

754
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:04,160
I'm so these are mostly just kinda as a
I'm

755
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:08,450
per have concept so that Nessman as I
miss the great their Blu ray player

756
00:42:08,450 --> 00:42:11,940
are the ones on the left is a TV um

757
00:42:11,940 --> 00:42:15,380
and so you can see here

758
00:42:15,380 --> 00:42:19,160
on the left side is in the yellow cable
coming out that's the thing that Jack

759
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:19,950
built in

760
00:42:19,950 --> 00:42:24,460
to this router this one only had one is
an AJAX I have a USB adapter two

761
00:42:24,460 --> 00:42:25,040
Ethernet

762
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:29,680
going out the other side and then I have
two little lines coming out from the USB

763
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:34,560
and they're just clamping n to the power
that's coming from the device itself

764
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:37,950
I it's the same thing for for both these
amuse the exact same

765
00:42:37,950 --> 00:42:41,390
idea this is a good picture on the
bottom

766
00:42:41,390 --> 00:42:46,440
left on the power pap and these are all
parts you can get it very the very

767
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:49,740
common parts isn't like advance very
rare things are something you can order

768
00:42:49,740 --> 00:42:50,349
them

769
00:42:50,349 --> 00:42:53,730
online up pretty much anywhere in the
world

770
00:42:53,730 --> 00:42:57,380
um so what we want to do is

771
00:42:57,380 --> 00:43:01,079
but may sever the connection solder it
somehow

772
00:43:01,079 --> 00:43:05,030
but to to the motherboard and then

773
00:43:05,030 --> 00:43:09,170
replace Ethernet jack are tapping the
Finance Act this particular

774
00:43:09,170 --> 00:43:11,869
about it was really are this bluray
player was really nice because it

775
00:43:11,869 --> 00:43:12,750
actually had

776
00:43:12,750 --> 00:43:16,260
exposed a little points for soldering
onto so that one

777
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:19,849
when I get home I might actually play
rowlett because I'm much less likely to

778
00:43:19,849 --> 00:43:23,880
destroy it and I just give up and not
care because it's it's the Ethernet Jack

779
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:24,530
L

780
00:43:24,530 --> 00:43:28,130
really need it's a play blu-rays um

781
00:43:28,130 --> 00:43:31,829
but this one can be put into that pretty
much anything

782
00:43:31,829 --> 00:43:36,450
but talked about this this'll be a
leader in um

783
00:43:36,450 --> 00:43:39,900
so was a so modify hardware on the spot

784
00:43:39,900 --> 00:43:43,220
United there's all this at home by
you've seen

785
00:43:43,220 --> 00:43:46,849
doing that the point of sale or the
desktop scenario

786
00:43:46,849 --> 00:43:51,250
screwdriver by minutes and access unless
you can plug in and walk away

787
00:43:51,250 --> 00:43:54,740
it's like a flash are sitting at the
back our new hardware whatever

788
00:43:54,740 --> 00:43:58,500
um you can set things the update they
can

789
00:43:58,500 --> 00:44:02,109
an alternate firmware the web interface
um

790
00:44:02,109 --> 00:44:05,260
making it very easy things I would never
do is like

791
00:44:05,260 --> 00:44:09,790
open up the TV and a hotel room and
stick something in there

792
00:44:09,790 --> 00:44:13,770
and then close the backup that now is
this something I do not recommend

793
00:44:13,770 --> 00:44:17,030
anybody ever do

794
00:44:17,030 --> 00:44:21,700
but if you are you doing an actual test
that did that is not here I did not do

795
00:44:21,700 --> 00:44:22,579
that here

796
00:44:22,579 --> 00:44:26,339
of I would never do that ever but I
definitely would never do that here

797
00:44:26,339 --> 00:44:29,770
arm said the a vs

798
00:44:29,770 --> 00:44:34,369
so there is the you know I really in
this was theoretically in a hotel RM

799
00:44:34,369 --> 00:44:37,369
I but if you are and you know how many

800
00:44:37,369 --> 00:44:42,260
timmy's you see any corporate offices
and around here i mean you have

801
00:44:42,260 --> 00:44:46,569
lots and access these things in there
and possibly very sensitive areas

802
00:44:46,569 --> 00:44:50,140
and who takes a party me so look for
them as the

803
00:44:50,140 --> 00:44:53,680
you know the the thing that might be
attacking mean if you're an attacker

804
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:56,859
you just have the nearest CVS store this
keep you know

805
00:44:56,859 --> 00:45:00,109
putting stuff on though the local
craigslist or wherever to sell

806
00:45:00,109 --> 00:45:03,859
and get these in there somehow soothe a
plane into the network for setup as you

807
00:45:03,859 --> 00:45:07,020
always have to plug it in the first time
the network

808
00:45:07,020 --> 00:45:09,550
you have your your back door you have
your window and even if it's just a

809
00:45:09,550 --> 00:45:11,050
five-minute window

810
00:45:11,050 --> 00:45:15,069
you've got your tunnel out

811
00:45:15,069 --> 00:45:18,400
the San examples of things you need to
think about you doing

812
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:21,990
a hardware an embedding is

813
00:45:21,990 --> 00:45:25,710
you know kiss if you're not familiar
with this its generally keep it simple

814
00:45:25,710 --> 00:45:26,579
stupid

815
00:45:26,579 --> 00:45:30,740
I'm but in this case is keep it small
Stephen still wanna be trying to put

816
00:45:30,740 --> 00:45:33,920
a laptop inside %uh they TV

817
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:37,400
that is not while you have a lot of
teachers there that's probably not the

818
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:38,050
best in a

819
00:45:38,050 --> 00:45:42,750
gonna run into a lot of issues so to
make conditions obviously I have to say

820
00:45:42,750 --> 00:45:47,089
adult its own been slightly biased to
say the the glitch is something that I

821
00:45:47,089 --> 00:45:48,250
would recommend using

822
00:45:48,250 --> 00:45:52,230
but other devices pump like is another
and pen testing

823
00:45:52,230 --> 00:45:55,240
a tool that their hardware device that's
out there

824
00:45:55,240 --> 00:45:59,819
about this big actually a power brick
but its preset with the lotto the ads

825
00:45:59,819 --> 00:46:01,940
attack tools make things really easy

826
00:46:01,940 --> 00:46:05,980
are you have to find something more
power for it iner to me know

827
00:46:05,980 --> 00:46:09,470
devices can potentially be years some
are better than others

828
00:46:09,470 --> 00:46:12,859
raspberry PIs which one the router
scenarios were sort of

829
00:46:12,859 --> 00:46:16,140
that I'm taking what was using a
Raspberry Pi for the router

830
00:46:16,140 --> 00:46:19,910
many poner which was the %uh there
router that I was showing

831
00:46:19,910 --> 00:46:23,740
be flash with some attack tools on it

832
00:46:23,740 --> 00:46:28,599
the dog kinda stuffy really looking at
size and capability

833
00:46:28,599 --> 00:46:31,670
I so that's that's kinda the modifying

834
00:46:31,670 --> 00:46:35,440
love hardware portion and that's been my
primary focus

835
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:39,849
because I see no doubt this device I'm I
wanna see what I can do with that

836
00:46:39,849 --> 00:46:43,130
but the other side is is firmware and I
think there's a few more talks and i'm

837
00:46:43,130 --> 00:46:44,099
glad to see it

838
00:46:44,099 --> 00:46:48,349
here at Black Cat Asia about sort of the
hardware level

839
00:46:48,349 --> 00:46:53,060
I'm debugging and modifying and I think
this is this is another case an area of

840
00:46:53,060 --> 00:46:54,660
things that are easy to do

841
00:46:54,660 --> 00:46:58,280
and the same sort of like we can ship it
out to you I can replace it

842
00:46:58,280 --> 00:47:01,569
i doing the same things a little bit
more difficult to make this super

843
00:47:01,569 --> 00:47:03,010
malicious sometimes

844
00:47:03,010 --> 00:47:06,520
but another time that it's not so if you
never did than hardware

845
00:47:06,520 --> 00:47:10,319
let's talk about how you go about trying
to modify hardware

846
00:47:10,319 --> 00:47:14,810
arm a at promise you any of you guys can
do this if you have your program at all

847
00:47:14,810 --> 00:47:19,240
it just takes time you just have to get
used to some of the terminology

848
00:47:19,240 --> 00:47:23,720
and then open the languages and stuff a
lot of the stuff is very accessible

849
00:47:23,720 --> 00:47:26,970
so you wanna research when you pop open
the device

850
00:47:26,970 --> 00:47:30,670
probably the biggest ship on their is
the one you care about it almost always

851
00:47:30,670 --> 00:47:31,780
works out that way

852
00:47:31,780 --> 00:47:34,900
that's the one you want to go out there
whenevers physically in today s is

853
00:47:34,900 --> 00:47:36,770
actually you know the most important

854
00:47:36,770 --> 00:47:40,050
see look at a couple different comin
chip types

855
00:47:40,050 --> 00:47:43,809
like the arm Texas Instrument whatever
you looking for things in is a little

856
00:47:43,809 --> 00:47:44,809
more tricky

857
00:47:44,809 --> 00:47:47,960
on expose port so those little holes a
PC

858
00:47:47,960 --> 00:47:51,030
the bordello holes in them this is some
in a row

859
00:47:51,030 --> 00:47:54,700
those are interesting you should you
know take a picture that person up

860
00:47:54,700 --> 00:47:57,150
somewhere and say what do you what do
you think this should the

861
00:47:57,150 --> 00:48:00,900
is ur you know can somebody tell me
whether I should try to test this with

862
00:48:00,900 --> 00:48:05,040
some common ones RJ tag which again
tomorrow Bligh this there's a talk and a

863
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:05,780
tag

864
00:48:05,780 --> 00:48:09,520
and serial over you are some other very
common

865
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:13,069
the interaction methods

866
00:48:13,069 --> 00:48:15,680
are still looking for those and then
you're looking to see you can you can

867
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:16,720
you debug it

868
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:20,480
sometimes the bug means you know getting
input output sometimes it means you can

869
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:23,040
modify add that all kinds that you can
do

870
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:26,940
with his debug port and the reason they
exist as manufactures a want to be able

871
00:48:26,940 --> 00:48:28,609
to test them in a developing

872
00:48:28,609 --> 00:48:32,770
Andy if you ship it back to them it's
broken they don't want to throw it away

873
00:48:32,770 --> 00:48:36,720
they want to you know refurbish it
that's the whole jeered refurbished

874
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:37,480
devices

875
00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:40,609
that's what they do they use the debug
this and they in their fashion their

876
00:48:40,609 --> 00:48:42,390
farm where trade fair what's wrong

877
00:48:42,390 --> 00:48:45,119
it take some chips offer place a couple
things and then should be back out in

878
00:48:45,119 --> 00:48:45,640
charge you

879
00:48:45,640 --> 00:48:50,200
seventy-five percent of what they used
to are so in these things are easy and

880
00:48:50,200 --> 00:48:52,430
they're very common common standards

881
00:48:52,430 --> 00:48:55,640
a two great tools the uses on the bus
pirate

882
00:48:55,640 --> 00:48:59,829
and the good that because they will talk
to lots of different types of chips are

883
00:48:59,829 --> 00:49:01,270
two different architectures

884
00:49:01,270 --> 00:49:06,069
they're both very open source source
very user-friendly

885
00:49:06,069 --> 00:49:09,329
I'm some other common ones FTDI adapter

886
00:49:09,329 --> 00:49:12,720
is essentially a serial adapter and for
for

887
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:15,790
people maybe and a little more than ten
to the me

888
00:49:15,790 --> 00:49:18,990
are very use to the idea of cereal

889
00:49:18,990 --> 00:49:23,180
in the nets is eighties in nine is when
you speak at a governor prior to the

890
00:49:23,180 --> 00:49:23,869
eighties

891
00:49:23,869 --> 00:49:27,790
are they tease and a for the back Syria
was very common that I everything

892
00:49:27,790 --> 00:49:28,589
interacted

893
00:49:28,589 --> 00:49:33,200
it's still very common and hardware we
just don't as users interact with it

894
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:36,839
nearly as much as we use is a still
exist because it's very simple to

895
00:49:36,839 --> 00:49:37,579
interact with

896
00:49:37,579 --> 00:49:42,210
and why rebuild everything a lot of
stuff and a lot of times debug dumping

897
00:49:42,210 --> 00:49:43,940
information by our stuff the

898
00:49:43,940 --> 00:49:49,160
ends up being accessible over firmware
are over the serial connection

899
00:49:49,160 --> 00:49:52,339
i'm looking at Heidi's Vienna
programmers out there

900
00:49:52,339 --> 00:49:56,839
or is hobbyist programmers right even
though it does raise a hand here

901
00:49:56,839 --> 00:50:00,180
I'm me and like me and get I Cisco
school

902
00:50:00,180 --> 00:50:04,050
I like am at nobody sees you raising a
hand that that gets lost almost

903
00:50:04,050 --> 00:50:05,250
instantly

904
00:50:05,250 --> 00:50:09,000
I looking for developing communities

905
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:13,290
awesome type in the typo Jeff you well
you do is you would take the board

906
00:50:13,290 --> 00:50:16,609
you look at them very very fine print so
if you have class is mine and magnifying

907
00:50:16,609 --> 00:50:19,180
glass is very fine print Josa the type

908
00:50:19,180 --> 00:50:22,270
rearm and then you see a bunch in
letters and numbers

909
00:50:22,270 --> 00:50:26,680
you type those out onto the internet you
get a response they say oh that's this

910
00:50:26,680 --> 00:50:27,460
kind

911
00:50:27,460 --> 00:50:29,900
and you look for the development
community and I guarantee it'll be

912
00:50:29,900 --> 00:50:31,339
massive because the

913
00:50:31,339 --> 00:50:35,460
as far as I all the products we buy in
the world really revolved around a very

914
00:50:35,460 --> 00:50:37,069
small subset

915
00:50:37,069 --> 00:50:40,910
chips you'd be surprised at how many
manufacturers

916
00:50:40,910 --> 00:50:44,510
if you open up the case the new exactly
the same except for the case is

917
00:50:44,510 --> 00:50:46,579
different than is very very similar

918
00:50:46,579 --> 00:50:50,650
very common hardware issues throughout
cuz it's that you know it's the best in

919
00:50:50,650 --> 00:50:54,599
its lines all the high and use that are
the middle align so all the medium

920
00:50:54,599 --> 00:50:58,170
brands use it so there is no massive
communities out there

921
00:50:58,170 --> 00:51:01,410
and you know deadlines and such people
posting them online to get

922
00:51:01,410 --> 00:51:04,500
you know we've got to get it done in to
figure out how to get this done a man

923
00:51:04,500 --> 00:51:06,079
also in recent years

924
00:51:06,079 --> 00:51:09,809
with hobbyists wanting to use the ships
for their own endeavors

925
00:51:09,809 --> 00:51:13,290
very their startups are just you know
for fun are you find a lot of

926
00:51:13,290 --> 00:51:16,160
communities out there the developed at
this so you find

927
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:21,020
a food source libraries you'll find
links in big exception code:

928
00:51:21,020 --> 00:51:25,430
and things like that so getting started
in this again the learning curve

929
00:51:25,430 --> 00:51:29,290
is maybe now it used to be even ten
years ago

930
00:51:29,290 --> 00:51:32,880
and then the flashing methods is some
programmers the two middle on the top

931
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:33,930
ones the good fat

932
00:51:33,930 --> 00:51:37,710
the bottom middle one is the a bus
pirate you've got a couple other very

933
00:51:37,710 --> 00:51:38,990
common programmers

934
00:51:38,990 --> 00:51:42,930
I don't think any of these cost more
than forty dollars there did very cheap

935
00:51:42,930 --> 00:51:44,000
very accessible

936
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:47,270
his manufactures wanna make a you know
they've got a big group of people or

937
00:51:47,270 --> 00:51:49,740
they want startups to try to use their
chip

938
00:51:49,740 --> 00:51:54,030
some startup now got lotsa funding and I
potentially buy 10,000 a hundred

939
00:51:54,030 --> 00:51:55,369
thousand units while

940
00:51:55,369 --> 00:51:59,109
my startup is very small but in the end
if I get funded to be very big so they

941
00:51:59,109 --> 00:52:01,309
try to make it a very low entry level

942
00:52:01,309 --> 00:52:05,660
for a lot of these jailbreak is
obviously everybody is like it when I

943
00:52:05,660 --> 00:52:06,500
say that

944
00:52:06,500 --> 00:52:10,069
it how many people's minds like iPhone
Android like this remind us right away i

945
00:52:10,069 --> 00:52:11,040
jailbreak

946
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:14,859
but you can jailbreak you know firmware
as well I'm you

947
00:52:14,859 --> 00:52:18,000
essentially jailbreaking as I was
putting it into the development node

948
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:19,589
version where you can interact in

949
00:52:19,589 --> 00:52:24,230
lower levels you can use maybe default
development credentials if they get

950
00:52:24,230 --> 00:52:25,869
expose somehow

951
00:52:25,869 --> 00:52:29,720
are you can connect through a lot of the
common adapters just talking about

952
00:52:29,720 --> 00:52:33,829
losses have to be very mysterious a lot
of stuff will update over USB

953
00:52:33,829 --> 00:52:37,190
love you device is a plugin the USB know
if you go to the website

954
00:52:37,190 --> 00:52:41,150
to update your the firmware drivers or
something or firmware

955
00:52:41,150 --> 00:52:44,190
that saw your printer drivers or printer
firmware its

956
00:52:44,190 --> 00:52:47,950
lot it takes place over USB or through
the network

957
00:52:47,950 --> 00:52:51,319
so these are things that aren't as you
know obscure are bizarre to a lot of

958
00:52:51,319 --> 00:52:52,040
people

959
00:52:52,040 --> 00:52:55,099
I'm in a lot of times that'll work as a
method to interact

960
00:52:55,099 --> 00:52:58,960
or upload your malicious from where

961
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:04,670
a lot of things run Linux is a a lot of
devices run embedded Linux

962
00:53:04,670 --> 00:53:08,940
older versions in latex because newer
versions with their hot sexiness

963
00:53:08,940 --> 00:53:12,040
are really in like the core a bit like

964
00:53:12,040 --> 00:53:15,319
this so many drivers in the next now
that I don't then the next the kernel

965
00:53:15,319 --> 00:53:16,210
massive

966
00:53:16,210 --> 00:53:20,400
but all they need is a TCP IP stack and
some controllers and some basic commands

967
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:23,540
so a lot of times you find all the
rumors that the kernel

968
00:53:23,540 --> 00:53:27,490
which she now could be used for exploits
older versions and tools

969
00:53:27,490 --> 00:53:33,220
um but I you also got you know is Lex
even compile something else for it

970
00:53:33,220 --> 00:53:36,569
which makes it very easy I it's been a
real

971
00:53:36,569 --> 00:53:42,609
and by at the license is required to be
published

972
00:53:42,609 --> 00:53:46,170
its I had slurred speech and is it
published

973
00:53:46,170 --> 00:53:50,950
sure they published in you know on this
meaning really obscure Lincoln the 9s

974
00:53:50,950 --> 00:53:52,700
now has no links to it

975
00:53:52,700 --> 00:53:56,010
anywhere on the web and robust that text
says you can't touch this

976
00:53:56,010 --> 00:53:59,550
that's where they put the Nomad the
source code on but it's technically yes

977
00:53:59,550 --> 00:54:00,569
but the publisher said

978
00:54:00,569 --> 00:54:04,369
a lot of time to find stuff that's that
happen source and have not like the dude

979
00:54:04,369 --> 00:54:07,869
the lower level will be they open source
but the house in close source versions

980
00:54:07,869 --> 00:54:08,760
in there

981
00:54:08,760 --> 00:54:12,089
summary was BS the Eagles vs the says do
whatever you want don't tell anybody

982
00:54:12,089 --> 00:54:13,290
we're cool

983
00:54:13,290 --> 00:54:17,210
I young things so there's Linex is
compiled for are not the same

984
00:54:17,210 --> 00:54:20,609
architecture as we're used to it can be
compiled for arm

985
00:54:20,609 --> 00:54:24,480
our phones are on or a lot of the other
architectures also will run the exe

986
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:26,180
people poured it over

987
00:54:26,180 --> 00:54:30,220
so that's the ideal scenario cuz people
I'm sure the

988
00:54:30,220 --> 00:54:33,109
significant number people in the crowd I
would like to thank all hands when the

989
00:54:33,109 --> 00:54:35,930
race but I won't ask is and I want to
let down

990
00:54:35,930 --> 00:54:39,390
I'm it I had experience with with nynex

991
00:54:39,390 --> 00:54:42,690
and porting over stop using existing
tools very easy

992
00:54:42,690 --> 00:54:47,930
I mean these are you know can be small
and very embedded devices

993
00:54:47,930 --> 00:54:51,589
are so things that run Linux even look
up um

994
00:54:51,589 --> 00:54:54,790
online that that they run them it's a
little hard to find sometimes

995
00:54:54,790 --> 00:54:58,319
printers every pretty ever touched ever
runs Linux

996
00:54:58,319 --> 00:55:01,819
our TVs some good team is out there they
run Linux

997
00:55:01,819 --> 00:55:05,280
but same thing DVR DVD blu-ray &

998
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:08,849
we raise routers lot the routers um

999
00:55:08,849 --> 00:55:13,030
you can right now watch I mean I'd like
you can run the next one's on everything

1000
00:55:13,030 --> 00:55:16,950
or the giant in the Nexus the community
will convert

1001
00:55:16,950 --> 00:55:21,309
that tool NX but these are like these
and devices that you're not necessarily

1002
00:55:21,309 --> 00:55:23,980
modifying their gonna run the next
natively

1003
00:55:23,980 --> 00:55:28,369
and almost any in paying cuz wiry
rewrite the TCP IP stack if you can just

1004
00:55:28,369 --> 00:55:29,910
download the next minute

1005
00:55:29,910 --> 00:55:32,920
I'm running on time so many go through
this part pretty quickly

1006
00:55:32,920 --> 00:55:35,940
flashing open source firmware on two
routers

1007
00:55:35,940 --> 00:55:39,089
is good that's less likely before using
those routers

1008
00:55:39,089 --> 00:55:42,960
and you can do with across brands tons
and even matters

1009
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:46,390
dd-wrt an open the BRT are very commonly
found

1010
00:55:46,390 --> 00:55:50,940
so not security hackery stuff it's just
you can get a lot more features with it

1011
00:55:50,940 --> 00:55:54,700
I you can you know can figure out these
are some just ones I picked up offline

1012
00:55:54,700 --> 00:55:59,740
the one to the the far right is actually
the one that I was using the scenario

1013
00:55:59,740 --> 00:56:02,970
and then you can see it you know these
the ones cracked open UN and add them

1014
00:56:02,970 --> 00:56:05,819
obviously you want to remove the plastic
case cuz

1015
00:56:05,819 --> 00:56:09,900
you have no reason for it but also
sometimes you have to open up to modify

1016
00:56:09,900 --> 00:56:10,579
I'm

1017
00:56:10,579 --> 00:56:14,000
and this case you can all US grain this
Trojan router

1018
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:17,589
on the idea that I had to have been
implemented yet is essentially you how

1019
00:56:17,589 --> 00:56:19,710
you fashion with open source firmware

1020
00:56:19,710 --> 00:56:22,900
but you clone the normal web interface

1021
00:56:22,900 --> 00:56:26,099
so again users have no idea cuz the F

1022
00:56:26,099 --> 00:56:30,319
other source firmware is very advanced
whereas normally the home one is not so

1023
00:56:30,319 --> 00:56:32,280
you can DNA mapping everything out

1024
00:56:32,280 --> 00:56:36,140
but then you are trojan firmware that
you can ship by itself so this is an

1025
00:56:36,140 --> 00:56:37,450
embedded this is just

1026
00:56:37,450 --> 00:56:41,880
reselling a router kid enable RDP and
with your credentials could create a

1027
00:56:41,880 --> 00:56:43,549
reverse SSH connection

1028
00:56:43,549 --> 00:56:47,240
back out to you could have the hacking
tools they get launched to attack the

1029
00:56:47,240 --> 00:56:48,510
inside the network

1030
00:56:48,510 --> 00:56:52,410
you know whatever and so can I think
inclusion

1031
00:56:52,410 --> 00:56:55,920
what what kinda devices can we attack I
want to say

1032
00:56:55,920 --> 00:56:59,119
everything that's pretty much everything
I just listed a few things

1033
00:56:59,119 --> 00:57:03,660
but did you know what has primer all the
vices it's just how please them in a

1034
00:57:03,660 --> 00:57:07,309
attack scenario some really quick
counter measures

1035
00:57:07,309 --> 00:57:10,609
I you to purchase more reputable source
if you're

1036
00:57:10,609 --> 00:57:14,130
I monsoon at work for the sorts of
things that your if your printer is

1037
00:57:14,130 --> 00:57:16,849
scarier I'm your TV is making SSS

1038
00:57:16,849 --> 00:57:21,010
connections out you probably want to
look into that that's not normal

1039
00:57:21,010 --> 00:57:24,380
I disable debug parts of your hardware
manufacture

1040
00:57:24,380 --> 00:57:29,400
and enforce some sort of update
authentication for firmware

1041
00:57:29,400 --> 00:57:33,780
I've got a buncha resources listed I'll
call it but these online slot to go

1042
00:57:33,780 --> 00:57:35,109
through but this is sort of

1043
00:57:35,109 --> 00:57:38,230
some stuff I've your local here to
Singapore to go

1044
00:57:38,230 --> 00:57:41,329
can them tower them a lot of electronics
and stuff in there

1045
00:57:41,329 --> 00:57:45,119
I was there the other day as a kid in a
candy shop there was awesome

1046
00:57:45,119 --> 00:57:48,760
I like to thank a lot of people here
because I'm short on time would

1047
00:57:48,760 --> 00:57:52,280
this is the end I presentation that's my
creds

1048
00:57:52,280 --> 00:57:55,599
I I think ok up on the video I don't
know if I'm done with

1049
00:57:55,599 --> 00:58:02,329
being up here but I can try to take a
question and so that I may have to leave

1050
00:58:02,329 --> 00:58:07,740
or not yeah

1051
00:58:07,740 --> 00:58:12,619
armed with the rubber ducky I I I kinda
parallel their project some

1052
00:58:12,619 --> 00:58:17,720
and then they got out way ahead of me
the idea the tax attack scenario

1053
00:58:17,720 --> 00:58:21,750
is pretty much the same my focus has
been sorta demanding it

1054
00:58:21,750 --> 00:58:25,020
so you can port the attacks from the the
ducky which is another

1055
00:58:25,020 --> 00:58:29,760
a device that can do keystroke injection
I'm you can pour the the Knights is

1056
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:31,900
between that and some other hardware

1057
00:58:31,900 --> 00:58:36,040
I focus on embedding and also having you
able to run multiple

1058
00:58:36,040 --> 00:58:40,940
I plot more multiple attacks and also be
able to connect things like a USB

1059
00:58:40,940 --> 00:58:45,390
Arthur Bluetooth adapter in so my pen
out a liar to connect third-party

1060
00:58:45,390 --> 00:58:46,829
hardware into it

1061
00:58:46,829 --> 00:58:52,000
um and side chided mostly my my idea was
not just to have it be

1062
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:55,349
keystroke injection but to be able to
modify to be lots of different

1063
00:58:55,349 --> 00:58:58,859
things at once um thanks it

1064
00:58:58,859 --> 00:59:03,670
your questions yawning he threw me off

1065
00:59:03,670 --> 00:59:07,339
I this stuff is up here I'm sure the
switching out the next aqui mine once a

1066
00:59:07,339 --> 00:59:08,670
look at the hardware

1067
00:59:08,670 --> 00:59:11,920
real quick I'm gonna try to find someone
decided out there like you gonna be able

1068
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:13,270
to poke out in

1069
00:59:13,270 --> 00:59:16,099
see it so thank you thank you very much
for having me here
