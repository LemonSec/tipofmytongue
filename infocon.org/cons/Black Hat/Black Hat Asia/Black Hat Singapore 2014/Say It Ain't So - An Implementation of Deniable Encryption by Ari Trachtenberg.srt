1
00:00:00,049 --> 00:00:04,150
before I start I we start with the joke
and the joke isn't funny

2
00:00:04,150 --> 00:00:07,940
just like jon said the if you are funny
I'd be on late night not here

3
00:00:07,940 --> 00:00:11,139
but its comments are relevant so

4
00:00:11,139 --> 00:00:14,370
string walks into a bar bartender tells
them

5
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:18,590
get outta here we don't serve strings
strings really upset

6
00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:23,080
leaves the bar comes back again
bartender says

7
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:28,310
hey aren't you the same string just
walked in a string says no I'm afraid

8
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:28,699
not

9
00:00:28,699 --> 00:00:31,710
ok so with the string needs

10
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:36,239
you'll get it eventually a but the
string is a some sort of the noble in

11
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:36,820
crops in

12
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:40,700
in some way ok being able to convince
the bartender that he's really string

13
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:43,850
okay but that's not really relevant
before we go on

14
00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:48,190
okay so why listen to me

15
00:00:48,190 --> 00:00:52,129
well a this is all part of a broader
effort

16
00:00:52,129 --> 00:00:56,129
on smartphone security supported by then
a sub so

17
00:00:56,129 --> 00:01:00,180
meet up the mandatory disclaimer and I
guess the ultimate reason to listen to

18
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:00,780
me is a

19
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:04,010
at least for now I'm the only one
talking um

20
00:01:04,010 --> 00:01:07,670
so I'm gonna start with the main idea
I'm gonna tell you a little bit about

21
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:09,750
what's out there in the research

22
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:13,840
community out tell you the core
technology the core technology is fairly

23
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:14,869
sophisticated

24
00:01:14,869 --> 00:01:18,299
I'll give you the basics and

25
00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:21,549
there's a white paper out on the web
page you can look at a few I'll get some

26
00:01:21,549 --> 00:01:22,290
more details

27
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:26,330
I'll tell you a little bit of by law
implementation and implementations also

28
00:01:26,330 --> 00:01:27,689
available in source code

29
00:01:27,689 --> 00:01:31,159
I'm not stupid enough to put a binary
out a black cat

30
00:01:31,159 --> 00:01:34,850
'em but the if you are what you can also
email me

31
00:01:34,850 --> 00:01:39,030
and then we get tired we'll talk about
some conclusions alright so what's the

32
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:39,619
main idea

33
00:01:39,619 --> 00:01:44,740
the main idea is I want I have a
particular encryption

34
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:49,340
some random collection of characters I
wanna be able to decode it

35
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:53,229
into a possibly more different ways
depending on which key I present

36
00:01:53,229 --> 00:01:57,990
so if I present one key then the this
little messier becomes

37
00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:02,140
to make ok makes caffeine with citric
acid in water and just to be clear since

38
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:03,310
I know we're in Singapore

39
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:06,360
I'm talking about the drink coke a

40
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:12,280
and just so there's no confusion and the
other key if I presented

41
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:17,140
produces the other text to make ok makes
coal with heat and water which is

42
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:18,250
another type of coke

43
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:22,440
okay and so what i'd like you select a
plausible deniability about which

44
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:24,030
particular text I'm sending

45
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:27,980
okay so

46
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:32,000
you might say deniability lying that's
bad a bunch of people

47
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,830
that the bad things and got in trouble
but let me try to give you at least some

48
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:37,140
motivation for why

49
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:41,250
plausible deniability might be a good
thing so here let's consider the sad

50
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:42,209
face person

51
00:02:42,209 --> 00:02:45,390
let's say some executive maybe a coke
executive

52
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:50,200
a who's carrying some secret plain text
the recipe for Coke

53
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:55,470
with them in his industrial secord
Secret bag while he goes to a country

54
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:59,090
that maybe a is not particularly safe

55
00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:02,950
okay and he

56
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:06,519
carries the encrypt a version of the
recipe a

57
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:10,550
the rumor had it that at least one point
only three executives from coke had

58
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:14,239
this recipe and they all have to fly
supper plans let's say he's

59
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:18,360
he's going to this country with the
secret and he's attacked by

60
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:21,860
pirates or government or whoever else
might be there at this

61
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:27,030
your country um he would like to be able
to decode his encrypt the message

62
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:31,110
in front of these people under coercion
and show them that really is very

63
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:34,900
innocuous all it says is how you make ok
by mixing coal with

64
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:38,150
you know water while hiding is

65
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:44,290
actual plain text a Thanksgiving at
secret okay

66
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:47,310
no where else do you see this kind have

67
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:50,620
what we're what other applications might
you see arm

68
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:53,900
an obvious applications and secure
storage and I'll the tail a little bit

69
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:55,489
about what's done this already

70
00:03:55,489 --> 00:03:59,379
%uh so let's say you're human rights
activists somewhere

71
00:03:59,379 --> 00:04:02,930
and you have your dissident network on
your computer

72
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:06,930
%uh you don't want obviously since the
dissidents you don't want

73
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:10,819
to have to give them up if for some
reason you're cornered by thugs or what

74
00:04:10,819 --> 00:04:11,330
have you

75
00:04:11,330 --> 00:04:15,909
you want to be able to possibly the
crypt your dissident networking group to

76
00:04:15,909 --> 00:04:17,130
dissident network and

77
00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:20,720
make it seem like a social network or
something else

78
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:24,120
I electronic voting let's say you're in
a country

79
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:28,080
that's trying to vote to secede or part
of its trying to secede

80
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:31,590
hypothetically on and

81
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:35,860
national government is trustworthy but
the regional government is not

82
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:38,889
okay and so everyone does their voting
thing

83
00:04:38,889 --> 00:04:43,290
and you have your receipt electronic
receipt you want to be able to

84
00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:47,340
when the regional lords or whatever come
over

85
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:49,940
and ask you who did you vote for you
want to be able to demonstrate to them

86
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:51,470
you voted for them

87
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:55,050
but the both that you sent to the
National government

88
00:04:55,050 --> 00:04:58,720
%uh gets counted in the way that you
really wanted that

89
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:02,169
and last but not least %uh censorship a

90
00:05:02,169 --> 00:05:05,919
is an obvious application where you're
trying to send

91
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:10,639
information stating graphically a
biosensor

92
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:15,160
okay another more questionable
application potential application

93
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:20,160
this is suggested by divers turbine ski
a colleague of mine is deniable logs

94
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:23,340
okay let's say you have buddy a
filesystem

95
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:26,699
and you're doing things on that like

96
00:05:26,699 --> 00:05:30,660
removing files and if we had the most
power point you've got to be able to see

97
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:31,550
this

98
00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:36,820
um you might want the one version of the
locks to say that you have listed the

99
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:37,710
file

100
00:05:37,710 --> 00:05:41,190
and another version to say that you have
removed the file and so

101
00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:44,039
you know if you need to show to another
though you don't trust you can show them

102
00:05:44,039 --> 00:05:46,479
you don't do anything to this file but a
few

103
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:50,240
it's a show to someone else you can a
and I suppose you can use it for

104
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:53,360
creative accounting although I think
more so that will be legal so

105
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:56,380
it's not a good idea creativity in
accounting 0

106
00:05:56,380 --> 00:06:00,430
was told several times to not go well
together

107
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:05,210
alright so let me detail a little more
technically what our solution is

108
00:06:05,210 --> 00:06:08,650
you have a plain text and it's really
hard for you to see this

109
00:06:08,650 --> 00:06:11,880
I guess but that the size are also
available online

110
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:15,080
yellow plain text the you want to be
able to

111
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:20,810
store you have a decoy or two decoys so
the plaintiffs in this case was to make

112
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:22,389
ok makes caffeine with

113
00:06:22,389 --> 00:06:26,669
citric acid in water one decline might
be how you mix call with heat

114
00:06:26,669 --> 00:06:31,300
another one year might be. a you mix to
make smoking makes kohl's

115
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:35,639
acid in water okay so you have plane tax
and some decoys

116
00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:38,880
you want to be able to put them all
together with its core technology

117
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:42,940
and each tax that you're trying code
will get a different key

118
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:46,050
K she won the one all the way on the
left

119
00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:50,250
will deco to the original plan turks key
to with the co 2 the first decoy

120
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:54,490
heathy with the code deco to the second
decoy

121
00:06:54,490 --> 00:06:58,660
and maybe after you've been quiet today
you might also want to be able to

122
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:01,970
put in another decoy text cakey for

123
00:07:01,970 --> 00:07:05,410
and so you might be able to do that even
after you've been quick to the Turks

124
00:07:05,410 --> 00:07:09,060
so the wrong clear what I'm trying to do
here

125
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:13,639
kinda looks like alright good our
particular solution and I'll go into it

126
00:07:13,639 --> 00:07:15,419
a little more details soon

127
00:07:15,419 --> 00:07:19,160
on features reasonably short encrypt the
text

128
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:23,180
roughly and log n bits allows
incremental modification

129
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:28,280
above the encryption has a shorty
roughly logarithmic

130
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:31,360
okay you can plan ahead for the decoys

131
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:37,340
or in some cases you can also generate
the cortex after the fact

132
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:41,090
okay so what's out there there's a lot
of stuff

133
00:07:41,090 --> 00:07:44,569
up though that's similar in the disc
encryption world's

134
00:07:44,569 --> 00:07:48,180
there's the I'll famous rubber hose
filesystem

135
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:51,539
are written by sons dreyfus and one min
um

136
00:07:51,539 --> 00:07:54,849
and ironically enough there's very
little literature out there on how it

137
00:07:54,849 --> 00:07:56,300
actually works

138
00:07:56,300 --> 00:08:00,310
um but the it's no longer maintained

139
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:03,330
a officially and unofficially

140
00:08:03,330 --> 00:08:06,810
I guess this is part 2 somehow related
to WikiLeaks

141
00:08:06,810 --> 00:08:09,900
on this Frio TFT a

142
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:12,930
which is another attempt to doing
something like this which

143
00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:16,490
a i think is also not maintained on the
website no longer

144
00:08:16,490 --> 00:08:19,780
is on by them this steak FS which is a

145
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:23,199
a follow-on to rubber hose filesystem

146
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:27,650
by McDonald and cooling based on the
some aka them a quirk by Anderson

147
00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:29,160
Needham and Samir

148
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:32,399
and this true croat probably many have
you heard of

149
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:36,269
TrueCrypt is a pretty neat I unique
concept

150
00:08:36,269 --> 00:08:39,419
several different loads but in one load

151
00:08:39,419 --> 00:08:43,419
well what ru could does is it takes all
the free space on your hard drive

152
00:08:43,419 --> 00:08:47,640
and fills it with random bits and then
if you want to hide

153
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:51,070
a volume in those random its you simply
encrypt

154
00:08:51,070 --> 00:08:55,930
volume and put it in the free space ok
and because it's encrypt edits in theory

155
00:08:55,930 --> 00:08:58,339
indistinguishable from random text

156
00:08:58,339 --> 00:09:02,250
for from random but sorry and so there
for someone looking at the volume

157
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:03,279
doesn't know

158
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:06,410
whether you're free space is hiding a it
in volume

159
00:09:06,410 --> 00:09:09,649
or not the

160
00:09:09,649 --> 00:09:12,700
okay so they also some a

161
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:18,470
solutions out there I the simplest one
is the so-called one-time pad

162
00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:23,029
okay the one type at you take a the text
that you want to generate random

163
00:09:23,029 --> 00:09:24,690
characters which is the key

164
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:28,130
up top and you at the Caribe

165
00:09:28,130 --> 00:09:31,959
the he to the text character by
character to get the

166
00:09:31,959 --> 00:09:36,519
encrypt that cipher text okay and the
nice thing about this is you can decode

167
00:09:36,519 --> 00:09:37,660
the cipher text

168
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:41,620
any plain text you want simply by
choosing a different key

169
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:45,480
okay so whatever text you want to be
called the STU you simply

170
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:48,529
X or or are these or subtract these two

171
00:09:48,529 --> 00:09:52,019
character by character to get the key
that you need to get there the problem

172
00:09:52,019 --> 00:09:53,540
is that the key is very long

173
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:57,709
it's a same length as the tux it running
code so this is not a

174
00:09:57,709 --> 00:10:01,040
visible solution

175
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:05,200
yeah that's good this is the version 2 I

176
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:10,310
so that's good I just want to make sure
your way cause this time away

177
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:14,529
%uh the key should have been different
there was also some nice work in

178
00:10:14,529 --> 00:10:16,209
academic literature

179
00:10:16,209 --> 00:10:19,339
the founding work on this a

180
00:10:19,339 --> 00:10:23,170
was called the noble encryption by
committed working or less risky

181
00:10:23,170 --> 00:10:27,480
they look a slightly different model
where you in Co Inc ripped with random

182
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:30,810
bits and you want to be able to the
crypt a different message

183
00:10:30,810 --> 00:10:34,769
a with the for random its improve that
that was the message

184
00:10:34,769 --> 00:10:37,910
there's another version others called
should be practical

185
00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:42,350
the noble encryption um and by deniable
there's a there's a whole lotta love

186
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:45,620
a democratic on that

187
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:50,230
okay so let's get to the core technology
and the

188
00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:53,459
again I'm gonna try to cover the set
somewhat high level and if you're

189
00:10:53,459 --> 00:10:56,769
interested in any this feel free to
going deeper but I can easily give you

190
00:10:56,769 --> 00:10:57,630
an entire week

191
00:10:57,630 --> 00:11:01,459
course on just this material so I'll try
to be high-level

192
00:11:01,459 --> 00:11:04,940
attempt the three core technologies most
which we've developed

193
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:11,430
a some level %uh said reconciliation
strong reconciliation unique decoding

194
00:11:11,430 --> 00:11:15,640
alright so let me go over these one by
one causes aka

195
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:19,899
I saw my calendar popping up on the most
embarrassing talks over

196
00:11:19,899 --> 00:11:23,670
had you know what's counter message
popped up in the middle of the talking

197
00:11:23,670 --> 00:11:25,420
for the hundreds of people

198
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:29,430
with some personal information about the

199
00:11:29,430 --> 00:11:33,610
speaker and hear it but so the sentry
conciliation problem

200
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:37,110
%uh you have Alice and Bob and each have

201
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:40,200
a collection a set AppData

202
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:45,149
in this case its a a phone book with
names and phone numbers

203
00:11:45,149 --> 00:11:48,649
okay and what you'd like to do is figure
out what the differences are between

204
00:11:48,649 --> 00:11:50,570
Alice and Bob Spano

205
00:11:50,570 --> 00:11:54,139
phone books using as little
communication as possible

206
00:11:54,139 --> 00:11:57,490
okay in this case if you stare at it
really hard you'll see that

207
00:11:57,490 --> 00:12:01,130
Alice has one extra-person

208
00:12:01,130 --> 00:12:07,839
to: miss H the Bob doesn't have been bob
has DS car boy that Alice doesn't up

209
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:12,370
okay so the question is how do you do
this with a minimum on communication

210
00:12:12,370 --> 00:12:15,610
and the big idea is the UN code

211
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:19,079
the date as polynomials a okay so

212
00:12:19,079 --> 00:12:23,399
you take your set has elements X 12 X
and

213
00:12:23,399 --> 00:12:28,860
%um code is a polynomial Z minus X 10 -6
to zzzz a variable

214
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:32,519
the minus x3 okay bob does the same
thing

215
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:37,019
and the key inside here and if I'm
losing you I'll be back in a minute

216
00:12:37,019 --> 00:12:40,290
okay the key insight here is that if you
divide

217
00:12:40,290 --> 00:12:44,730
the polynomial Alice and Bob okay all
the common

218
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:49,850
said elements disappear okay the
numerator denominator is cancel out

219
00:12:49,850 --> 00:12:54,980
and you left a numerator with all the
settlements Alice has a bob doesn't

220
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:59,070
and on the nominator all the things that
bob has that Alice doesn't

221
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:02,420
okay so this is a rational function you
can totally that with

222
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:05,430
a number of points that's a the

223
00:13:05,430 --> 00:13:08,860
degree or the Russell function and the
punch line here is

224
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:12,019
Alice and Bob can figure out how many
differences they have

225
00:13:12,019 --> 00:13:15,350
with the communication that depends only
on how many differences they have

226
00:13:15,350 --> 00:13:16,709
between them

227
00:13:16,709 --> 00:13:20,220
okay so Alice can have $20 million

228
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:23,570
entries Bob can have twenty million
entries if they have one difference

229
00:13:23,570 --> 00:13:26,750
you need to send roughly one piece of
information for them to figure out the

230
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:28,750
difference

231
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:33,459
okay another problem that's important to
this is the stream reconciliation

232
00:13:33,459 --> 00:13:33,940
problem

233
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:37,940
here Alice and Bob each have a strain
rather than the set

234
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:41,709
okay the key differences in a string the
characters the order matters

235
00:13:41,709 --> 00:13:44,740
and in a set the order does not okay

236
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:49,300
and again we want to figure out what are
the differences between the two strings

237
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:52,839
with those little communication as
possible on

238
00:13:52,839 --> 00:13:56,899
and in academia we like to do is we like
to take a problem we don't know how to

239
00:13:56,899 --> 00:13:57,620
solve

240
00:13:57,620 --> 00:14:00,800
and make a look like a problem we do
know how to solve and then well we solve

241
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:01,889
that problem

242
00:14:01,889 --> 00:14:06,550
aka so in this case I just told you how
we do it set reconciliation

243
00:14:06,550 --> 00:14:09,720
and so we're gonna do is we're going to
convert the string reconciliation prom

244
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:11,790
into some reconciliation problem

245
00:14:11,790 --> 00:14:15,470
by using something called Ching Ling I'm
gonna take the

246
00:14:15,470 --> 00:14:18,570
first 3 characters ok my strain

247
00:14:18,570 --> 00:14:21,699
I F in space then I'm gonna take

248
00:14:21,699 --> 00:14:24,680
the first the character starting at the
second character than the first two

249
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:26,339
characters starting a third character

250
00:14:26,339 --> 00:14:29,740
Arctic all possible three character
substrings

251
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:35,480
up Alyssa string and all possible three
character substrings a bob strain

252
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:38,680
okay and lo and behold those former
sucks

253
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:43,250
and I already know how to reconcile sets
Sol reconcile the certs

254
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:47,829
okay the problem is that at this point
Alice will know the set

255
00:14:47,829 --> 00:14:52,760
I'll substrings a bobbin by summer so
but you won't know what the string is

256
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:57,019
okay and the reason is that there might
be several ways to put those substrings

257
00:14:57,019 --> 00:14:58,180
together

258
00:14:58,180 --> 00:15:01,860
so for example if we have got an A in
Kanata if you look at their true

259
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:03,160
character substrings

260
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:07,690
they look the same okay but you can be
coded into either one

261
00:15:07,690 --> 00:15:10,720
and so we need some tricks for how to
figure out

262
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:14,410
up how to make sure that there's only
one decoding

263
00:15:14,410 --> 00:15:18,050
alright so those three papers in about
the slides

264
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:22,279
but I'll let's go to the actual
implementation

265
00:15:22,279 --> 00:15:26,279
so if I want to encrypt my plain text
when I'm gonna do

266
00:15:26,279 --> 00:15:31,300
is p I'm gonna here you can follow it on
the right so my plain text is to make

267
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:34,540
coke makes coffee in a citric acid
induce

268
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:37,670
camp I can split up into

269
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:41,230
these shingles k pick some up those
shingles

270
00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:45,250
generator polynomial other those singles
remember the C minus

271
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:49,380
elements okay evaluate up all no meal

272
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:53,850
at several points and my cipher text is
gonna be simply the evaluation on the

273
00:15:53,850 --> 00:15:54,670
polynomial

274
00:15:54,670 --> 00:15:57,930
at those points okay

275
00:15:57,930 --> 00:16:02,399
Mikey is going to be some %uh the
shingles I know you can see it because

276
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:06,329
PDF as a it's at the bottom there

277
00:16:06,329 --> 00:16:10,250
okay so my such a test is a valuation
paul o'neill's mikey is

278
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:14,250
the shingles okay 2d crypt

279
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:17,740
I will take Mikey and evaluate its
polynomial

280
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:21,699
it's as if I'm doing a reconciliation
problem

281
00:16:21,699 --> 00:16:27,810
K I will reconcile those points with the
values I got from the cipher text

282
00:16:27,810 --> 00:16:32,380
and reproduce the string if I want to
deceive you

283
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:35,720
I will create a different key which is
different shingles

284
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:39,850
okay and we will reconcile the you'll
get a different set of shingles which

285
00:16:39,850 --> 00:16:41,910
will be put together into a different

286
00:16:41,910 --> 00:16:45,910
text okay

287
00:16:45,910 --> 00:16:49,779
we have some implementation detail just
to show you a

288
00:16:49,779 --> 00:16:54,180
no I took I euros at the computer
revolution by Steven Levy

289
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:58,310
um looked at the text size aside for
like the key length or you can see is

290
00:16:58,310 --> 00:17:00,800
that the key link doesn't grow very much

291
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:04,299
but the cipher link does it's pretty big

292
00:17:04,299 --> 00:17:09,030
okay the San this implementation

293
00:17:09,030 --> 00:17:13,160
okay you so

294
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:17,630
let me just summarize what what what we
have here I have a technique where

295
00:17:17,630 --> 00:17:21,730
you can encrypt your text okay with one
encryption

296
00:17:21,730 --> 00:17:27,110
and that encryption can be D cryptid
into many different possible tax

297
00:17:27,110 --> 00:17:30,390
the text that you had in mind and
possibly

298
00:17:30,390 --> 00:17:34,910
a whole bunch of other decoys depending
on what you use

299
00:17:34,910 --> 00:17:38,919
the implementation that I have and the
code that I have available is based on

300
00:17:38,919 --> 00:17:43,460
the a work so we have one son
reconciliation string reconciliation

301
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:44,429
unique decoding

302
00:17:44,429 --> 00:17:48,260
the security here is information
theoretic in nature meaning

303
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:51,720
the adversary has no way of knowing a

304
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:55,940
has no way of proving that you had one
text verses another unless

305
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:59,980
he has some side information okay and
you might

306
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:04,370
a not not also you can generate a whole
bunch because not all of them

307
00:18:04,370 --> 00:18:08,929
might be meaningful they're also
limitations on this work

308
00:18:08,929 --> 00:18:13,000
a its slow K need some good engineering

309
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,390
if you want to make it really practical
um

310
00:18:16,390 --> 00:18:21,520
the keys can be made shorter you can
encrypt in blocks rather than the entire

311
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:23,320
text

312
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:27,280
um as a whole buncha references together
with

313
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:30,789
Creative Commons are roughs

314
00:18:30,789 --> 00:18:36,230
a.m. %ah and that the most important
slide was the last one

315
00:18:36,230 --> 00:18:39,830
a 0 which contains

316
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:45,280
p.m. let's go back to the beginning

317
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:49,740
yeah just this information and the

318
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:53,059
i'm happy if you have any questions feel
free to email me the code is all

319
00:18:53,059 --> 00:18:56,100
available the source code is all
available online

320
00:18:56,100 --> 00:19:01,039
a and the if you I mention anything
about this talk I will

321
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:05,760
probably deny it thank you

322
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:06,010
any
