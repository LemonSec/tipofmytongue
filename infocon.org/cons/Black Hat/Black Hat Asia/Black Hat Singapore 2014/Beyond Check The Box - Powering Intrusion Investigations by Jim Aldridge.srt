1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:03,790
are welcome to well call it be on the
box

2
00:00:03,790 --> 00:00:07,399
power ensures investigation so the
Genesis for the saw

3
00:00:07,399 --> 00:00:12,120
has been my experience as a in San
responder as an investigator

4
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:15,670
a out in the corporate world working on
investigations

5
00:00:15,670 --> 00:00:20,470
and as part of my job and assault in
those investigations and

6
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:23,740
warming else's we need a lot of data
from our our clients

7
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:29,199
and find that lot organizations and
implemented a lot of different tools

8
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:32,960
and so that the dashboards and they've
got pie charts and graphs a

9
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:36,540
interesting things about the network
they have security event management

10
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:37,570
system

11
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:41,020
um but ultimately there they haven't

12
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:46,270
implemented the procedures and really
tested use cases that enable them to

13
00:00:46,270 --> 00:00:49,840
drive useful information from those
holes that they have

14
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:54,940
I'll an investigative contest so on the
agenda for today I want to spend a few

15
00:00:54,940 --> 00:00:55,489
minutes

16
00:00:55,489 --> 00:00:59,160
begin this talking about what is an
investigation

17
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:02,750
how how do you get a new investigation
what are some of the key things

18
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:06,479
a key goals with an investigation and
what I said they did you need

19
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:09,700
and then review 5 capabilities

20
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:13,590
I've abound very important to providing
data that is needed

21
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:16,600
to from to do investigation %uh

22
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:19,850
I wanted to set up brother I'm not gonna
be talking about specific tools

23
00:01:19,850 --> 00:01:23,950
to answer these five capabilities a at
as appropriate as I don't they all

24
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:24,490
mention

25
00:01:24,490 --> 00:01:27,990
where there are techniques that you can
use and where there are

26
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:32,240
open source of commercial all ultimately
this is really not about the tolls about

27
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:36,450
understand the capabilities and and that
applying the mall to get all that are

28
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:37,229
out there

29
00:01:37,229 --> 00:01:41,070
on summer what's your organization's may
and probably already possess

30
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:46,000
um to get to the the harder that ball so
the five capabilities are

31
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,329
number one if you have an IP address own
internal IP address

32
00:01:51,329 --> 00:01:56,719
and timestamp you need to have the
capability to take that information and

33
00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:59,920
determine what host that corresponds to
so the computer system

34
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,939
on the hostname if you have an account
name

35
00:02:02,939 --> 00:02:06,369
that there's an interest in your
investigation you need to be able to

36
00:02:06,369 --> 00:02:07,920
take that account name

37
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:11,610
and for some period of time figure out
where that account's been use

38
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:12,459
authenticate

39
00:02:12,459 --> 00:02:16,420
you need to be able to have and Internet
IP address

40
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:21,410
so its think attacker command control
and figure out

41
00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:24,510
what other systems in the environment
besides the one or two that you may know

42
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:25,120
about

43
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:28,770
have communicated with that address and
I mean early and then also going back

44
00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:29,890
sometime in the past

45
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:34,379
up the same goes for domain name
resolution it up so if you have a

46
00:02:34,379 --> 00:02:37,500
fully qualified domain name associated
with

47
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:41,670
attacker tall was laid back or are you
need to be able to trap

48
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:44,860
what systems have was all that domain
and um

49
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:48,800
similar but but also a different than
looking at the network activity in all

50
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:52,660
also quite a while later and insist on
this is very important

51
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:55,810
you need a capability to where your
environment

52
00:02:55,810 --> 00:02:59,950
searching for indicators a compromise
and this is really important to take the

53
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:00,340
N

54
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:03,879
the results of your investigation is
progressing and convert that into useful

55
00:03:03,879 --> 00:03:05,489
information that can allow you

56
00:03:05,489 --> 00:03:09,060
so one-year investigation across the
entire enterprise

57
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:13,340
then all but the very smallest
organizations this is a a really

58
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:19,500
critical component so

59
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:23,030
as we go through I'd like you to put
yourself an investigator shoes a picture

60
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:23,650
that

61
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:27,090
as we go to these case studies that
you're the person that's responsible

62
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:30,940
within your organization whether or what
but then 1 other clients if your console

63
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:35,440
or figuring out what's going on was
attacked during the environment

64
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:39,340
what they did they steal I we get them
out here and consider

65
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:42,470
as we go through these today if this
were to happen in your organization so

66
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:43,720
if somebody gave you

67
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:47,700
but he's information I'm about to show
you on as a a pop for the

68
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:51,190
use case would you be able to do with
that information would you

69
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:54,069
you know if you can if you would say
immediately yes we definitely had its

70
00:03:54,069 --> 00:03:54,769
capability

71
00:03:54,769 --> 00:03:57,930
we could ditch that information here so
we would do it that's great %uh

72
00:03:57,930 --> 00:04:01,950
if the answers that tell you this will
be difficult than I suggest that

73
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:05,640
it's something that you may want to
think about doing I'll to take that take

74
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:06,510
that thought back

75
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:10,470
and and kinda integrate that into your
ongoing security projects to try and get

76
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:11,260
that data

77
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:14,709
on the last time the worst time to the

78
00:04:14,709 --> 00:04:17,359
first thinking about these issues is
when you're in the middle of an

79
00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:18,380
investigation

80
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:22,520
beginning an investigation um a and I it
that's where I am

81
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:26,210
all the time with my clients where on
things a bit

82
00:04:26,210 --> 00:04:29,270
River real fans I you're working late
nights

83
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:33,150
you working twenty-plus hours a day
include yours Austin

84
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:36,710
you not sleeping at the office and
executives are hammering your boss a

85
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:38,509
questions they're trying to get answers

86
00:04:38,509 --> 00:04:41,750
that's not the time to be thinking about
to have this capability

87
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:46,820
um I would suggest building your own use
cases so take what I one saying here is

88
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:48,120
my experience

89
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:51,860
take your own experience from the types
that a investigations that you dont

90
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:52,860
either other job search

91
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:56,460
your organization and come up with a set
of capabilities that you think are

92
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:58,669
useful in the contacts at your
organization and

93
00:04:58,669 --> 00:05:02,850
really is individualize it depends on
what service providers you may have that

94
00:05:02,850 --> 00:05:05,330
made by capabilities that you don't need
to duplicate

95
00:05:05,330 --> 00:05:08,479
et cetera basically come up with these
use cases and figure out

96
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:11,509
what are we gonna do from here how can
we build these capabilities

97
00:05:11,509 --> 00:05:15,120
um it's going to be hard work it Ando

98
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:18,500
I would not be a billionaire be retired
at this you notice if I come up with a

99
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:18,930
way to

100
00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:22,639
to solve this problem in an easy way but
there really is no

101
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:26,680
shortcut this is definitely going to be
a lot of hard work but it will pay off

102
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:30,970
on the unfortunate day when your job and
it's a

103
00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:34,000
to give you a little bit contact the who
I am

104
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,060
and and what I do I'm a senior manager
are with a company called mandiant

105
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:41,360
which is a subsidiary of fire I and I'll

106
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:44,560
my world is is primarily running um

107
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:48,539
its investigations mostly for fortune
500 type

108
00:05:48,539 --> 00:05:53,600
companies I'm eyelash a ride to 10
investigations personally

109
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:57,750
I and our organization we had a a was
all around 200

110
00:05:57,750 --> 00:06:02,389
so we don't leave me this a lot so I do
every day and

111
00:06:02,389 --> 00:06:05,720
a lot of what I do during the during a a
response is

112
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:09,220
so I'm a team lead no I'm I'm
interfacing with

113
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:12,630
specials on my team making sure they're
looking at the right things making sure

114
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:14,160
that their words accurate cetera

115
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:17,639
and also in appraising the client salt
other the

116
00:06:17,639 --> 00:06:21,060
um the person has to have the same
discussions and things Obama relate to

117
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:22,060
you today

118
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:26,569
with client explain what we really need
to tell us what this hostname is because

119
00:06:26,569 --> 00:06:29,350
if you know if you get also the host
name is there's a if you're gonna give

120
00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:30,860
me a list 10 systems that

121
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:33,910
may have had this IP address maybe that
we're gonna have to spend

122
00:06:33,910 --> 00:06:37,000
you know this level up look at those
chances are

123
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,740
I'll so work with clients to get answers
to all these questions

124
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:44,900
so your contacts on investigations and
it's been my experience in this really

125
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:45,699
depends on

126
00:06:45,699 --> 00:06:48,970
the your type work you do is
investigator but the majority have

127
00:06:48,970 --> 00:06:52,039
the incidents that that i've been
involved then started with the

128
00:06:52,039 --> 00:06:54,650
notification from a law enforcement
agency

129
00:06:54,650 --> 00:06:59,250
um and and and i'll carry out this with
my experiences but mostly

130
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:02,970
United States a european-based companies
I really have not done

131
00:07:02,970 --> 00:07:07,360
that much work in Asia but I respect is
probably up some more

132
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:11,169
so what happens in these situations is
governed knocks on your door

133
00:07:11,169 --> 00:07:14,699
um in the US is often the Federal Bureau
of Investigation

134
00:07:14,699 --> 00:07:17,840
or maybe other agencies depending on
what type attacker and

135
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:22,000
doesn't fall and they say I'll you got a
problem

136
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,590
let me give you a list uva IP addresses
here's three counts are compromised

137
00:07:26,590 --> 00:07:29,819
I'm thank you have a good day and it's
not that they're they're being

138
00:07:29,819 --> 00:07:32,580
you know the meaning or purpose they
they have other objectives and

139
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:34,139
investigative work that they do

140
00:07:34,139 --> 00:07:38,530
up there providing this information as a
as a courtesy and it's very limited

141
00:07:38,530 --> 00:07:41,560
keep in mind if you're on this the
receiving end of a notification from an

142
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:45,440
actual party goers long horseman or
another another arm

143
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:49,560
your organization or someone else that
information they provide years probably

144
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:50,620
not complete

145
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:54,250
so it's really important to take this as
he this is interesting is the tip

146
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:57,440
a potential iceberg let me make sure
that I got this

147
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:00,860
but this is all this is because my
experience the

148
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:03,940
say they tell you that you have three
insect systems that are affected a very

149
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:07,310
often that the numbers actually a tire
that all you do is remove those three

150
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:11,580
as well the other way that like the my
clients identify these

151
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:15,419
missus self-identified up which and the
cases I did

152
00:08:15,419 --> 00:08:19,669
last calendar year there's three out of
10 that actually found themselves a lot

153
00:08:19,669 --> 00:08:21,550
to get notified by law enforcement

154
00:08:21,550 --> 00:08:24,960
so usually had identified is a sysadmin

155
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:29,050
or security armed security person
identify something unusual that usually

156
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:30,620
antivirus catches

157
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:35,919
um so in this capital up sent a
screenshot some reports basically

158
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:39,490
this was a password hash number that was
running on %uh workstation

159
00:08:39,490 --> 00:08:42,779
%uh one case I had last year they
actually caught past operating on a

160
00:08:42,779 --> 00:08:43,860
domain controller

161
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:47,050
um which was helpful about it is rather
than look at it and say

162
00:08:47,050 --> 00:08:50,670
great great win for anti-virus I let's
move all of the day

163
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:53,930
this they ask that goal question which
is how

164
00:08:53,930 --> 00:08:56,880
the password hash number get on my
domain controller and then that turned

165
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:57,130
in

166
00:08:57,130 --> 00:09:01,800
that attacker been an environment for a
bit over two years

167
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:05,040
so these are the questions up

168
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:08,940
and by the way if you have the black hat
CD recovered City

169
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:13,029
most the slide to the slides that have
I'll bullet points in more words those

170
00:09:13,029 --> 00:09:13,610
are on

171
00:09:13,610 --> 00:09:16,940
on the CD on both the screenshots of are
um

172
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:20,709
arm sent to support things are not amid
also the white paper

173
00:09:20,709 --> 00:09:24,060
this is those on the CD has a lot of
this information in more depth and also

174
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:24,850
has a

175
00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:27,990
references and I'll other suggested
reading

176
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:31,510
so these are some questions that
executives in the company

177
00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:34,920
and your boss is going to ask if you
picture your the investigative it so

178
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:38,410
what was exposed what did we do we lose
the

179
00:09:38,410 --> 00:09:41,779
secret formula a in the next question
the brings to mind is

180
00:09:41,779 --> 00:09:45,680
what I have to do about this cuz their
world is re- great might be on the news

181
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:49,350
on do I have to notify regulators I have
to notify my customers

182
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:52,519
on how bad is this is one system can I
go to bed at night

183
00:09:52,519 --> 00:09:55,709
or asleep or just you know thousand
systems on

184
00:09:55,709 --> 00:09:58,720
how much money did you lose which is
also course very important

185
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:02,670
how the attacker getting so we can close
its doors I and then the bottom line is

186
00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:05,959
how to effectively stop this attack and
republic but move on

187
00:10:05,959 --> 00:10:10,260
closed doors so o'neill straight one
other reasons that it's very important

188
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:11,519
to you

189
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:15,260
um to do the investigation correctly in
this because

190
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:18,839
this is how the if you the better
investigation

191
00:10:18,839 --> 00:10:23,089
you perform a more thorough the better
your mediation effort is going to be

192
00:10:23,089 --> 00:10:26,120
so in this example this this is %uh

193
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:28,920
this is from a presentation I don't like
it two years ago on on target

194
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:29,890
remediation

195
00:10:29,890 --> 00:10:34,399
and other reference in that white paper
if you're interested in the topic but

196
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:37,810
basically picture this somebody came to
you and said you're in fact that you

197
00:10:37,810 --> 00:10:38,550
have

198
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:42,040
up attack on your network there's three
systems that are affected

199
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:45,649
are sorry once in the that tell you
about this pc1 pc2

200
00:10:45,649 --> 00:10:49,040
and Web servers also collected you clean
tc1

201
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:52,450
you thank them and you play it but if
you don't do an investigation

202
00:10:52,450 --> 00:10:56,670
you don't realize %um no way to tell
that easy to solve that it's all the

203
00:10:56,670 --> 00:10:58,100
attackers control the web show

204
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:01,410
on the web server selected and solve the
attackers control

205
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:04,680
so you really haven't done anything
except for you know maybe if the

206
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:07,310
attacker cares notice you told them that
you know about

207
00:11:07,310 --> 00:11:10,760
whatever you did that PC 10 about this
man in control

208
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:14,079
so the better you can answer these these
questions

209
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:17,810
on that were posed the better you can
mediate

210
00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:21,930
another example I want to point this out
within a bit later so these questions

211
00:11:21,930 --> 00:11:23,019
that we ask

212
00:11:23,019 --> 00:11:27,640
up the them and ask relate to you don't
understand the totality of what the

213
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:30,769
it after did so you know what I just
chase now are which is why I see a lot

214
00:11:30,769 --> 00:11:34,790
love on less experienced investigators
doing so in this situation

215
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:39,029
you got two laptops that have been
fished and they're communicating wasn't

216
00:11:39,029 --> 00:11:39,890
manage all

217
00:11:39,890 --> 00:11:43,510
about well the IP addresses and domain
names are the same here are

218
00:11:43,510 --> 00:11:46,839
total chose a random so this is
anybody's company I apologize you

219
00:11:46,839 --> 00:11:49,980
you're not actually 0 um

220
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:52,970
so this piece is that this is a
compromise but if all you do is buy now

221
00:11:52,970 --> 00:11:55,380
wear your lien upon these two systems

222
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:58,800
you're not gonna miss the fact that
there's an interesting activity on this

223
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:03,149
application server no as a not use that
use or what what what the attackers

224
00:12:03,149 --> 00:12:05,079
doing on this file servers maybe use

225
00:12:05,079 --> 00:12:09,430
writing files lee also FTP out know what
you doing on this database server

226
00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:12,779
you're gonna miss all those contact a
contextual details which can be very

227
00:12:12,779 --> 00:12:14,139
important to understanding

228
00:12:14,139 --> 00:12:17,180
what really happened so it's important
that investigate

229
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:21,170
intrusion and the activities that
usually are being performed by

230
00:12:21,170 --> 00:12:24,430
his any target threat by human being

231
00:12:24,430 --> 00:12:29,100
a it's not just the is an hour so

232
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:32,240
those highlevel questions just that I
that I let out earlier thats what

233
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:35,230
that's what exactly is going to be
asking that's what no your boss is going

234
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:35,720
to be

235
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:38,940
getting hammered with you know multiple
times a day in meetings all day

236
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:42,320
so oil over so what are the questions
you need an answer now

237
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:46,529
as a investigation leads a technical
personal

238
00:12:46,529 --> 00:12:50,389
so how far back Cisco well as early as
seven to compromise

239
00:12:50,389 --> 00:12:53,820
in certain such investigations this is
really important as a bottom-line impact

240
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:55,209
like for example

241
00:12:55,209 --> 00:12:59,089
if you process payment data or if you've
lost up credit card information

242
00:12:59,089 --> 00:13:02,990
a secret heart for missions also other
types regulated personal information

243
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:06,240
this is you live and die by this because
a it just say your system's really

244
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,300
compromise last week

245
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:10,769
well you shut down tonight then you went
to a compromise that the credit card

246
00:13:10,769 --> 00:13:12,269
brands are going to hold you

247
00:13:12,269 --> 00:13:15,930
you know tell before is free love the
GSH the attacker definitely showed up

248
00:13:15,930 --> 00:13:16,740
Wednesday

249
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:19,620
if you can determine that or if it turns
out the attackers been in the

250
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:21,170
environment for a year

251
00:13:21,170 --> 00:13:24,360
then your exposure just went up greatly
from our from a legal

252
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:28,430
with apps but attacker did you wanna
know this obviously is that you can

253
00:13:28,430 --> 00:13:29,310
perform the

254
00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:32,709
the right remediation has to make it so
that it harder over the attacker to get

255
00:13:32,709 --> 00:13:34,500
enough Sun

256
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:37,880
what's the latest evidence that activity
so we all know the when the attacker got

257
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:38,480
in

258
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:41,709
we also know is the attack occurred
early in the environment right now

259
00:13:41,709 --> 00:13:45,100
is and if so was it doing I'll sometimes
that

260
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:48,260
that actually actively coming back daily

261
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:51,880
stealing information or doing what
whatever that come due

262
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:55,940
in some cases the attacker will have
systems compromised infected in the

263
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:58,070
environment so that you can come back
when he wants

264
00:13:58,070 --> 00:14:00,790
but is not actually doing anything else
you wanna know that too what's was it

265
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:02,089
after dole

266
00:14:02,089 --> 00:14:05,820
um what systems are under the attackers
control so you wanna know what the

267
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:06,910
attacker touched

268
00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:11,160
which is why we call compromise the also
want to know it is infected with Mauer

269
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:14,500
because that's something that the
attacker has back to all system

270
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:17,970
or has configured some sort of condition
there's a back door like

271
00:14:17,970 --> 00:14:21,760
the Sticky Keys backdoor Eurasian

272
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:24,490
you wanna know that so that you can
clean all that up to make sure that the

273
00:14:24,490 --> 00:14:25,180
attacker

274
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:28,260
not be back here bar that contain up

275
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:32,579
you know since the attacker accessed you
note but it is exciting if you look now

276
00:14:32,579 --> 00:14:34,389
aren't buying our but

277
00:14:34,389 --> 00:14:37,430
if you want to find a tough anyone know
what the attacker stole you need to look

278
00:14:37,430 --> 00:14:39,820
for what's this is the attacker access

279
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:43,350
what did he do so what if the attacker
do on the system's that that he

280
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:47,380
that he targeted so the attacker %uh
simply connect to a system into a

281
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:48,690
directory listing

282
00:14:48,690 --> 00:14:51,860
did the attacker browse through certain
directories I'll

283
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:55,949
if so which ones maybe you can tell what
I the data

284
00:14:55,949 --> 00:14:59,639
%uh the attacker maintain access the
environment so on persistence

285
00:14:59,639 --> 00:15:03,430
up they have back doors that are running
they have access to your VPN

286
00:15:03,430 --> 00:15:06,149
by the way if you don't have to factor
that occasion for your TV and you should

287
00:15:06,149 --> 00:15:07,209
write that down to note

288
00:15:07,209 --> 00:15:11,899
and do that I this week is that sub
that's a way that is also maintain

289
00:15:11,899 --> 00:15:13,160
access

290
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:16,170
as its after operating inside the
environmental lateral movement this is

291
00:15:16,170 --> 00:15:16,600
really

292
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:20,160
I'll this is going to help you
investigate

293
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:23,820
and the German systems that is accessed
that might not be obvious because they

294
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:25,550
but I can tell

295
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:29,579
what tools that it's not deployed um you
want to be able to identify those tall

296
00:15:29,579 --> 00:15:33,139
what they do and also what accounts the
attacker compromise the attackers gonna

297
00:15:33,139 --> 00:15:34,380
be

298
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:38,860
generally it anybody but the least
sophisticated targeted Thacker

299
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:43,509
is gonna grab some accounts and then use
those in such a network install a ball

300
00:15:43,509 --> 00:15:48,300
so this is not magic um in order to
answer all these questions about line

301
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:52,800
you need data points and so for the
russes talk I'm home gonna go through

302
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:55,810
some specific examples of the types a
data point jeannie D

303
00:15:55,810 --> 00:16:02,730
and a and why you Needham

304
00:16:02,730 --> 00:16:06,620
so mapping and IP address or hostname

305
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:11,199
I this is a and an excerpt has been
sanitized from

306
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:14,860
a report from a third-party talk to all
my clients and investigate beginning an

307
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:16,220
investigation

308
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:19,540
and so they said that on this particular
day the

309
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:23,029
attacker I'll command control right here

310
00:16:23,029 --> 00:16:26,199
was used to control the system here
which is in your network ones that you

311
00:16:26,199 --> 00:16:28,560
nineteen to 43.3

312
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:32,329
and they said that okay he access to
back door so there was a back door all

313
00:16:32,329 --> 00:16:35,980
the system and there's a list today to

314
00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:39,759
here's what he did by the way while the
on this day he accessed

315
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:43,480
these three other systems from this to
the point soaps the 10

316
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:46,810
IP addresses into IP address and then
unknown you don't know that

317
00:16:46,810 --> 00:16:50,949
with the snares you definitely wanna
take a look at what he may have done a

318
00:16:50,949 --> 00:16:52,100
systems because

319
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:56,240
against all data you to umm maybe stolen
credentials

320
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:59,320
to come back later United stall a

321
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:03,730
a certificate might actually put in the
back door on a system that you might

322
00:17:03,730 --> 00:17:05,490
know about

323
00:17:05,490 --> 00:17:09,319
so some say this is what would you
really worried about here so this random

324
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:13,459
us the hosting that you know about this
is the one that was listed in the report

325
00:17:13,459 --> 00:17:16,459
um this guy over here who you don't know
yet because you

326
00:17:16,459 --> 00:17:19,660
have been able to find the hostname the
back door that it up

327
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:22,799
what they did so DHCP logs

328
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:27,900
in in the majority of environments vast
majority DHCP services are provided by

329
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:31,660
domain controllers that are the local
and in the environment where the

330
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:34,950
home where your own points are in data
centers

331
00:17:34,950 --> 00:17:38,370
up me they were talking about
workstations laptops is

332
00:17:38,370 --> 00:17:41,600
servers generally have my keys at all
I'll change too much although

333
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:45,130
you still want the DHCP logs burning
which is easy

334
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:48,700
um this is showing in the in the actual
panels

335
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:51,840
in a the DHCP control panel where you
can

336
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:54,120
enable audience so it really is
literally hear something where you can

337
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:55,490
just check the box

338
00:17:55,490 --> 00:17:58,620
when those all-star recording log and
store it locally

339
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:02,570
and this is basically what you get so
what you can get here is that

340
00:18:02,570 --> 00:18:05,870
um on the to 21-14 this

341
00:18:05,870 --> 00:18:10,950
IP address 7820 was assigned to the
system a post and it went UK

342
00:18:10,950 --> 00:18:14,660
number one and that's got the mac
address which can sometimes be useful

343
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:18,429
on so this is i've information that that
that you're gonna get

344
00:18:18,429 --> 00:18:21,900
it is up um a challenge that

345
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:25,679
is in order to do something with that
you want to make sure that

346
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:28,929
even if you don't have a sense i delete
you have some collectors every update

347
00:18:28,929 --> 00:18:29,770
City

348
00:18:29,770 --> 00:18:32,980
security event a management tool and you
would be

349
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:36,049
all those logs somewhere you can execute
a quick weary and

350
00:18:36,049 --> 00:18:39,480
just type in the IP address filter by
the date and able to show you know

351
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:40,870
that's

352
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:44,220
you wanna make sure that your July Aug
if you don't have a sim because even if

353
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:45,260
you don't have a sim

354
00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:49,549
you can still go to that the issue the
server

355
00:18:49,549 --> 00:18:52,500
when you're doing investigation inquiry
does law but only if you've been

356
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:53,150
generating

357
00:18:53,150 --> 00:18:56,900
so it's really important is to start
generating ozell capture

358
00:18:56,900 --> 00:19:01,220
another way that you can do this um say
you don't have a cell

359
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:04,450
you could even create something simple
like schedule tasks to

360
00:19:04,450 --> 00:19:07,559
first log files to a central repository
so its

361
00:19:07,559 --> 00:19:10,429
but not very pretty do this especially
in a big organization but I have seen it

362
00:19:10,429 --> 00:19:11,190
done

363
00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:15,010
%uh investigation %uh but I did last
year it now this capability

364
00:19:15,010 --> 00:19:18,280
which we try to put in place and the
best they could do was a basically ship

365
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:19,289
these logs to

366
00:19:19,289 --> 00:19:22,919
a vulture and so I got off to a
workstation

367
00:19:22,919 --> 00:19:26,860
on their network that I had access to
and Iran power grab

368
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:30,230
against those laws in the running to
look up something Tagg

369
00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:34,240
I'll another large Lords a shower with a
couple years ago actually

370
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:37,850
up their bad up water contractors that
work for the security come in and

371
00:19:37,850 --> 00:19:41,360
its basically built something based on
and nap that was that they would

372
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:45,059
said scanner with and nap looking for a
retrieving

373
00:19:45,059 --> 00:19:48,400
the binding between host names and IP
and pushing into a bicycle they this

374
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:53,260
I'll with this up in you know less than
a day it was prude but it did get a job

375
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:56,919
others in the lot organizations rely on
here is um

376
00:19:56,919 --> 00:20:00,490
control panels or things like your
antivirus or you're out your system

377
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:01,549
management agents

378
00:20:01,549 --> 00:20:04,880
those a typically provide you some kind
of mapping up

379
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:08,640
historically love which the subject and
a given time into that you can determine

380
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,789
what hopes that have which I P

381
00:20:10,789 --> 00:20:14,470
I'll that's not as good as having to the
issue of because that's all we're gonna

382
00:20:14,470 --> 00:20:15,270
cover

383
00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:18,590
systems that are a that have those
agents on them so

384
00:20:18,590 --> 00:20:23,850
there was not a system no a non baseline
on Windows non-windows another main

385
00:20:23,850 --> 00:20:26,240
number system or contractor laptop or
something

386
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:30,340
didn't have your agent then you won't be
able to query it

387
00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:33,640
so very important I put this is not his
number one in these aren't generally in

388
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:34,320
order

389
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:37,720
but I find that if you if you're not
able to map

390
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:41,000
at the a system name to an IP address

391
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,049
a lot of the other things i wanna talk
about can't you can end up with

392
00:20:44,049 --> 00:20:47,690
with up dead ends where say you your

393
00:20:47,690 --> 00:20:53,100
logging I'll packets destinations enough
are what the bar also

394
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:56,340
your login connections to see two you
get a hit %uh

395
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:59,710
and you got an IP address from this said
three months ago but if you don't know

396
00:20:59,710 --> 00:21:01,830
hostname it is and this information is
not what that is

397
00:21:01,830 --> 00:21:05,480
so this this is the foundational it

398
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:10,390
at so moving on the second capability
that I I want to highlight is

399
00:21:10,390 --> 00:21:15,520
systems you want to find out which
systems a particular count think it too

400
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:19,450
this is an excerpt II sanitize from all
the top oven triage report so

401
00:21:19,450 --> 00:21:23,309
hollis hostname pivot system and

402
00:21:23,309 --> 00:21:26,720
the are allowed to highlight is um

403
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:31,240
first thing that happened was so this
domain slash service account

404
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:35,640
logged on from system up from system
that

405
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:39,240
um and then logged

406
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:43,260
in so to other systems or bottom line is
you know that the

407
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:46,390
the attackers demonstrated that he's
been using this account in this

408
00:21:46,390 --> 00:21:50,140
in this time in this time period so

409
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:53,429
from the from the pivot system you know
the attackers login some

410
00:21:53,429 --> 00:21:57,539
some other systems do the the system and
else is that you that you don

411
00:21:57,539 --> 00:22:00,760
and the reason this is important as also

412
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:04,450
I said earlier all but the most
simplistic targeted attackers are going

413
00:22:04,450 --> 00:22:05,200
to use

414
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:08,320
I'll was a record agile Sparta managers
and so

415
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:12,760
this on the screen here is a model that
I used to explain

416
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:16,419
the life cycle of a targeted intrusion
me ideas that

417
00:22:16,419 --> 00:22:20,520
not every insurance gonna have all these
these days is but essentially there's an

418
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:21,860
initial couple must

419
00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:25,820
is preceded by some reconnaissance the
attacker

420
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:29,090
gains a foothold so that's the first
such a picture fishing

421
00:22:29,090 --> 00:22:32,460
attack that sorta fishing that's that
very first system that he manages to

422
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:34,000
compromise

423
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:38,010
from there the attacker will escalate
the privileges

424
00:22:38,010 --> 00:22:41,960
obtain credentials for that for system
that they popped

425
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:45,830
and then use those you for former
process

426
00:22:45,830 --> 00:22:48,820
and move around the network ultimately
looking for usually its intraday data

427
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:50,429
looking still

428
00:22:50,429 --> 00:22:54,799
so this is important to know the reason
I put this in years that

429
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:57,850
because at attackers are moving around
with legitimate rentals having the

430
00:22:57,850 --> 00:22:59,059
capability to query

431
00:22:59,059 --> 00:23:02,730
your event logs are very important ought
to be able to track this kind of

432
00:23:02,730 --> 00:23:03,630
activity

433
00:23:03,630 --> 00:23:06,720
on this is an area where I I see a lot
of up week is out there %um companies

434
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:07,360
that have

435
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:10,390
obscuring about management roles most to
them

436
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:13,740
are don't really have them what I would
call fully deployed even the server

437
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:14,909
population so

438
00:23:14,909 --> 00:23:19,110
met domain controller logs but they
don't have up a lot of other logs to

439
00:23:19,110 --> 00:23:22,490
specially from from servers that can to
help us

440
00:23:22,490 --> 00:23:25,760
so given this information see

441
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:28,150
there's some pit system and you know
that the attackers been using the

442
00:23:28,150 --> 00:23:29,020
service L

443
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:32,090
that's the key piece information here's
what could be happening yours

444
00:23:32,090 --> 00:23:35,950
one possible explanation that you need
you need is logged in order that affair

445
00:23:35,950 --> 00:23:38,990
out %uh what's going on so

446
00:23:38,990 --> 00:23:42,990
it could be that there's a lot of its
been compromised and %uh

447
00:23:42,990 --> 00:23:46,580
so that you have fished with whatever
the latest up maybe this this latest

448
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:47,130
I'll

449
00:23:47,130 --> 00:23:50,419
on word doc horrible and their

450
00:23:50,419 --> 00:23:54,110
p isn't communicating with this
particular issue

451
00:23:54,110 --> 00:23:57,620
and eliminate make a leap year it's a
sin this is

452
00:23:57,620 --> 00:24:02,820
something that we ceased sometimes um
enough various associations that we do

453
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:05,890
so the attacker is operating through the
system so if

454
00:24:05,890 --> 00:24:09,850
if you can picture the back door on the
system has a proxy for Shelly that's

455
00:24:09,850 --> 00:24:10,200
like

456
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:13,740
SOCKS proxy so rather than

457
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:17,220
rather than doing a lot of dirty work on
this laptop because this is the one

458
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:18,700
that's infected so you're kinda like

459
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:21,720
you know you may find out whether
somebody may find and tell you about it

460
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:24,909
the attackers gonna be sneaky and not
use that so he's going to just proxy

461
00:24:24,909 --> 00:24:25,610
through

462
00:24:25,610 --> 00:24:28,840
is an RDP to some other random system
so-called

463
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:32,520
all up its system

464
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:35,549
some other things the attacker may be
doing with that account that %uh the

465
00:24:35,549 --> 00:24:36,020
main

466
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:40,140
serves Cal is they may be maybe he's
connected to an application server

467
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:43,620
and %uh installed some kinda unknown
back door

468
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:48,299
so you know that use copy some files up
schedule task the at command

469
00:24:48,299 --> 00:24:51,789
as he's got credentials I'll maybe then
I didn't mean that a maybe this as a

470
00:24:51,789 --> 00:24:52,330
server

471
00:24:52,330 --> 00:24:55,669
some server admin credentials let me
talk about something I T that some kinda

472
00:24:55,669 --> 00:24:56,840
low-level admin

473
00:24:56,840 --> 00:25:00,710
relaxes the server so maybe is gonna run
to put a backdoor on their

474
00:25:00,710 --> 00:25:04,669
maybe it's a back door that you don't
currently know about but

475
00:25:04,669 --> 00:25:07,549
if you follow the trail you know the
attackers using this account service

476
00:25:07,549 --> 00:25:08,340
account so

477
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:12,770
what you should do is look for all the
places within that time windows you know

478
00:25:12,770 --> 00:25:15,130
the attacker was active on those days
and I mention

479
00:25:15,130 --> 00:25:19,190
you once are looking in at logs to try
and find out

480
00:25:19,190 --> 00:25:22,669
where what else the was an account used
for soul summer those things are

481
00:25:22,669 --> 00:25:23,840
probably gonna be legitimate

482
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:26,840
and is not take some work working with
the whoever

483
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:30,020
uses that account start figure out
what's the gym and what's not

484
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:33,299
up but someone's gotta set off alarms
you know it you prolly 10 this is the

485
00:25:33,299 --> 00:25:34,210
investigator

486
00:25:34,210 --> 00:25:37,640
I'll is that what you do when you sit
down with the application admin

487
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:42,150
show them the list accounts and say the
less-developed doesn't it look at you

488
00:25:42,150 --> 00:25:43,870
and say wait a minute wait a minute this

489
00:25:43,870 --> 00:25:47,580
the systems and you know the other
division there's no reason

490
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:51,289
that that this account whatever indicate
there that's a red flag then you want to

491
00:25:51,289 --> 00:25:53,059
look at that system

492
00:25:53,059 --> 00:25:56,059
on the other thing that you couldn't
that that you're looking for is maybe

493
00:25:56,059 --> 00:25:56,840
the attacker

494
00:25:56,840 --> 00:26:01,070
log in to this file server on the pit
system and maybe copy some files and

495
00:26:01,070 --> 00:26:02,640
maybe that was actually what he

496
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:07,320
FTP out environments that he stole data
and if you don't do this exercise that

497
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:08,600
was that

498
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:12,210
I'll no thinking maybe he RTP into this
database

499
00:26:12,210 --> 00:26:16,409
and then dump some they doubt database
tables and then ship that aw

500
00:26:16,409 --> 00:26:19,860
up so you know about this stuff down
here that's in the lower right corner so

501
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:21,770
you know that use PS exacting

502
00:26:21,770 --> 00:26:26,570
system a system be in Cincy but this all
this up here

503
00:26:26,570 --> 00:26:30,470
a you don't know about so you want to be
able to the

504
00:26:30,470 --> 00:26:34,039
to search for a couple different things
so you wanna be able to take the

505
00:26:34,039 --> 00:26:37,240
up domain slash service account

506
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:41,779
you want to be able to look or where
that account login

507
00:26:41,779 --> 00:26:44,830
some the source of the state system

508
00:26:44,830 --> 00:26:49,039
a the other thing that would be useful
as if you could look or alright

509
00:26:49,039 --> 00:26:52,409
you know the attackers on the pivot
system so you know you don't have a

510
00:26:52,409 --> 00:26:54,460
system on a particular day cuz you got

511
00:26:54,460 --> 00:26:57,850
these artifacts that show you use active
on systems that use act on this is the

512
00:26:57,850 --> 00:26:58,140
law

513
00:26:58,140 --> 00:27:02,640
Sunday do you want to look for on Sunday
around the time the attackers also since

514
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:03,350
there is a simple

515
00:27:03,350 --> 00:27:06,659
a you know 8 o'clock the 10 o'clock

516
00:27:06,659 --> 00:27:10,570
you look the where did that work who

517
00:27:10,570 --> 00:27:13,559
what a pathetic want to thank you what
network connections originated from that

518
00:27:13,559 --> 00:27:14,130
system

519
00:27:14,130 --> 00:27:17,260
at all with the account maybe another
county

520
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:20,470
um so why the ways you can do this

521
00:27:20,470 --> 00:27:25,750
is to look for um logs on the domain
controllers for her bursars tickets

522
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:28,870
of time to go into all the specifics up
her Bros which is

523
00:27:28,870 --> 00:27:32,309
are what are the underpinnings of acting
director at the occasion

524
00:27:32,309 --> 00:27:35,700
I'll if you don't so ideally you would
have laws

525
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:38,870
that induce them for all the servers you
be able just won the query

526
00:27:38,870 --> 00:27:41,960
in Iran all the data but in most
environments where

527
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:46,899
where I a investigate they usually have
lost some laws in the main controls but

528
00:27:46,899 --> 00:27:48,450
they don't have all the server's log

529
00:27:48,450 --> 00:27:52,190
yet so is on the plan gonna do it
sometime this summer that but with these

530
00:27:52,190 --> 00:27:54,039
professors tickets

531
00:27:54,039 --> 00:27:57,760
when a a user or really in the Cal

532
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:01,450
I'll requests access to a resource
there's this

533
00:28:01,450 --> 00:28:04,659
a a change in the timing control over
their issued a

534
00:28:04,659 --> 00:28:08,510
service ticket it says okay yes your you
know i met your lower taxes this

535
00:28:08,510 --> 00:28:10,340
resource

536
00:28:10,340 --> 00:28:14,240
so you can do with it so this is from my
test environment so I have this the snow

537
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:15,500
down here which is

538
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:19,190
I would you be a three-member 10 I which
is not twenty

539
00:28:19,190 --> 00:28:22,309
when you came in up when g3 number two

540
00:28:22,309 --> 00:28:26,850
which is not point while so I did not
net use command is not a

541
00:28:26,850 --> 00:28:30,029
all-share from one to the other this is
what you get

542
00:28:30,029 --> 00:28:34,029
in this is I'll was 2003 so what you get
is you get

543
00:28:34,029 --> 00:28:38,299
there two important things a is before
three important pieces

544
00:28:38,299 --> 00:28:43,120
username users or while you get service
named which is basically

545
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:46,130
where they logged into so that the
target of the

546
00:28:46,130 --> 00:28:49,399
that on occasion would you please
remember to then you get

547
00:28:49,399 --> 00:28:53,490
Klein address which is where they were
been so where the was the user when

548
00:28:53,490 --> 00:28:58,090
their dedicated up when this ticket was
issued and user was sitting right here

549
00:28:58,090 --> 00:29:01,470
so I abuses on investigations before too
um

550
00:29:01,470 --> 00:29:05,270
to identify additional systems we should
look at so what would happen

551
00:29:05,270 --> 00:29:08,730
at your back on this diagram is the
public yet maybe it's

552
00:29:08,730 --> 00:29:11,919
twenty or thirty systems that where this
account was used

553
00:29:11,919 --> 00:29:16,130
and you're not the just talk to somebody
into your okay is the five systems that

554
00:29:16,130 --> 00:29:17,190
it always logs into

555
00:29:17,190 --> 00:29:20,059
logs and you know every five minutes
automatically so those all those are

556
00:29:20,059 --> 00:29:20,820
okay

557
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:24,320
than the other ones you may need to do
some annual triage in

558
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:28,570
look it's and from a time one
perspective say okay I know that that

559
00:29:28,570 --> 00:29:31,240
this account looked at this time do
anything else we're happen oh yes

560
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:33,450
there's a scheduled task that was
treated right

561
00:29:33,450 --> 00:29:37,010
no five seconds after that that's weird
so you wanna go to the process to

562
00:29:37,010 --> 00:29:37,860
identify all

563
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:41,090
arms this is an example from

564
00:29:41,090 --> 00:29:46,039
up what a a commercial some product of
that I I did recently

565
00:29:46,039 --> 00:29:49,620
were hats are under attack so much here
but basically the

566
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:55,230
I did %uh payload contains hostname so I
had a bit system without looking for

567
00:29:55,230 --> 00:29:58,620
event ID's a 6-7 3 which is up her
service ticket issued

568
00:29:58,620 --> 00:30:01,820
and then a date range and then payload
contains

569
00:30:01,820 --> 00:30:05,399
account those looking for events a
certain time

570
00:30:05,399 --> 00:30:08,940
in a circle rain but I'm friend from a
certain system

571
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:12,840
using certain hell up I do need to point
out that

572
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:16,799
in Windows 2003 RTP if medications work
a bit differently

573
00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:20,980
in 2000 eighty you get the correct
source address

574
00:30:20,980 --> 00:30:24,760
in Windows 2000 us $3-8 you're not
because the service tickets actually

575
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:25,690
issued

576
00:30:25,690 --> 00:30:31,250
without 21 is the client which is Marty
paying for more number one to number two

577
00:30:31,250 --> 00:30:34,929
and then there than that recorded is
basically showing that

578
00:30:34,929 --> 00:30:40,360
on the IP address a source close number
two which is not really that helpful

579
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:43,690
such keep that in mind sure if you want
a reserve the kids

580
00:30:43,690 --> 00:30:48,860
when the 2008 with in LA enable a bit
like that the talks about what that is

581
00:30:48,860 --> 00:30:52,770
up it's correct because the dedication
mechanism it'd is a bit different

582
00:30:52,770 --> 00:30:57,640
not virgin so key things you will it
make sure you're logging all

583
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:59,330
applications

584
00:30:59,330 --> 00:31:02,769
and you want a lot successful that up to
you I'll

585
00:31:02,769 --> 00:31:06,940
amortization couple weeks ago that was
ur it at all the data logging they're

586
00:31:06,940 --> 00:31:07,600
doing

587
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:11,120
but their own login failed occasion
that's what's really are the lust

588
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:14,980
interesting on them my view for most my
purposes

589
00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:18,720
you wanna make sure that even if you
don't have a sim the just a logging them

590
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:22,590
and you still have up sufficient amount
about salsa reason is

591
00:31:22,590 --> 00:31:25,970
even if you don't understand you can
take

592
00:31:25,970 --> 00:31:29,200
other measures at the time that you need
that info to go out and grab it

593
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:32,899
I'll talk about some those later so
ideally

594
00:31:32,899 --> 00:31:36,350
for season or SEM I'll

595
00:31:36,350 --> 00:31:40,200
or if you don't have that capability you
can

596
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:43,480
which these logs to a central location
for searching up that

597
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:46,549
gets a very um it doesn't go over well

598
00:31:46,549 --> 00:31:49,870
you can do it in an emergency I've done
it before um

599
00:31:49,870 --> 00:31:52,919
with what I would say small environments
like maybe

600
00:31:52,919 --> 00:31:57,279
under 5000 systems otherwise the amount
of data just gets too big

601
00:31:57,279 --> 00:32:01,179
and that's managed by bus

602
00:32:01,179 --> 00:32:04,529
%uh this is this is a diagram from a Sat
status updates like

603
00:32:04,529 --> 00:32:08,679
up but I do its part my I'll I we've got
this my clients know what I want to do

604
00:32:08,679 --> 00:32:09,769
is illustrate so

605
00:32:09,769 --> 00:32:13,850
as a couple lines here I'll that you
don't know hot the highlight our

606
00:32:13,850 --> 00:32:17,140
so this publicist alone which is up
purple

607
00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:21,510
it's going up slowly so this this blue
line the goes up and down is basically

608
00:32:21,510 --> 00:32:24,710
that to be determined systems which are
the ones that are on art you to look at

609
00:32:24,710 --> 00:32:28,440
so the investigation starts up or find a
more most

610
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:32,590
one more things ball more potentially
compromised systems that are a few more

611
00:32:32,590 --> 00:32:33,100
you

612
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:36,519
that peace but a lot of things on the Q
doing it

613
00:32:36,519 --> 00:32:41,110
we're getting it down but then right
here with this appliances tools peace

614
00:32:41,110 --> 00:32:45,399
I basically was that query there was a
pivot system we knew the attackers acted

615
00:32:45,399 --> 00:32:49,789
and I use Kerber service tickets to
identify well

616
00:32:49,789 --> 00:32:52,880
couple hundred systems that the attacker
accessed I'll

617
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:55,970
and basically we determine their timing
ashes from those systems but we did the

618
00:32:55,970 --> 00:32:56,730
No

619
00:32:56,730 --> 00:33:00,769
ultimately it was helpful helpful
information but not

620
00:33:00,769 --> 00:33:03,990
you not heard all week but we could also
identified

621
00:33:03,990 --> 00:33:07,679
a back door that we didn't know about
this

622
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:11,460
um I don't spend too much time on that
said this is in the in the up the slide

623
00:33:11,460 --> 00:33:13,870
on the CD as well as a lot in the white
paper

624
00:33:13,870 --> 00:33:17,450
so suggestions are things that you might
wanna law on you if you compare this is

625
00:33:17,450 --> 00:33:20,049
on the other guy lines are out there
knows that there's a difference is a

626
00:33:20,049 --> 00:33:23,210
some other some the offense that are
commonly recommended

627
00:33:23,210 --> 00:33:27,240
at all on much use other bestie ably and
they tends to be

628
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:31,159
early recalling so I I don't recommend
those but these ones are there are

629
00:33:31,159 --> 00:33:32,250
important so

630
00:33:32,250 --> 00:33:36,909
win anything related to account logon
salons you wanna catch that success and

631
00:33:36,909 --> 00:33:37,510
they'll

632
00:33:37,510 --> 00:33:40,750
and then there's some additional events
that relate to um

633
00:33:40,750 --> 00:33:44,010
up like re connections to RDP sessions
that are

634
00:33:44,010 --> 00:33:48,140
interesting as well as lot onslaught of
or an explicit potentials can be really

635
00:33:48,140 --> 00:33:52,539
interesting as well

636
00:33:52,539 --> 00:33:57,080
so next determining the system's

637
00:33:57,080 --> 00:34:00,080
the communicated to you a specific IP
address

638
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:05,080
what's so three-piece information here
that are important are

639
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:09,770
doctor C two node was what to do about
7.8

640
00:34:09,770 --> 00:34:13,540
%uh and then blah blah up on this day

641
00:34:13,540 --> 00:34:16,649
the attacker reconfigure this other back
door

642
00:34:16,649 --> 00:34:20,369
so the back door was originally
communicating with this address

643
00:34:20,369 --> 00:34:25,639
the configured to communicate with his
new address so three pieces information

644
00:34:25,639 --> 00:34:28,649
so with this information what you want
to do is you have

645
00:34:28,649 --> 00:34:31,679
sums one system that's its infected

646
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:35,409
you are denoted tactics you knew that
already but there's another one

647
00:34:35,409 --> 00:34:38,889
that is also cracking that same command
control that you didn't know about

648
00:34:38,889 --> 00:34:42,710
so this is helpful you can query now
flow if you can query

649
00:34:42,710 --> 00:34:47,200
um you lost %uh firewall logs packet
accepts don't help

650
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:51,320
%uh it if you have it basically anything
that a lot you

651
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:55,409
query read on this IP address web
proxies as well

652
00:34:55,409 --> 00:34:58,490
but this also help you find another
system so

653
00:34:58,490 --> 00:35:01,970
the system is known to be infected it

654
00:35:01,970 --> 00:35:05,920
this is that system that had the back
door change to another IP

655
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:09,540
so is going to see tune in to c2 number
two

656
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:13,510
what you know about but what if I told
you next that that information was two

657
00:35:13,510 --> 00:35:14,460
months all

658
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:18,420
so it after two months ago

659
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:22,550
this backdoor was pointing the sea to
hear number three

660
00:35:22,550 --> 00:35:25,560
but it so

661
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:29,030
two months ago stick figure here today
its point its

662
00:35:29,030 --> 00:35:32,050
its a it's pointing to a different one

663
00:35:32,050 --> 00:35:35,380
maybe there's an additional system here
that you don't know about

664
00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:39,300
there was communicating with is
currently communicating with this

665
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:40,510
command control

666
00:35:40,510 --> 00:35:43,700
um and you just got that IP from
historical information

667
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:47,380
so my point is you want to be able to
also %uh leverage information back in

668
00:35:47,380 --> 00:35:47,849
time

669
00:35:47,849 --> 00:35:51,490
to %uh look for systems that you have
other was messed

670
00:35:51,490 --> 00:35:55,240
so furthest some mention %uh NetFlow

671
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:58,290
most are decisions that I work with at
least have

672
00:35:58,290 --> 00:36:01,390
log logging for firewall I'll

673
00:36:01,390 --> 00:36:04,790
the Boer firewalls logging successful
packets going out to the network

674
00:36:04,790 --> 00:36:08,740
that's very helpful I would keep as much
as you can if you

675
00:36:08,740 --> 00:36:13,010
if you get to work traffic is a arm

676
00:36:13,010 --> 00:36:16,109
um a storage becomes an issue

677
00:36:16,109 --> 00:36:19,320
you can start supplying some filters
like you don't necessarily need to know

678
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:21,109
every time somebody goes to

679
00:36:21,109 --> 00:36:24,460
York or website or what are your top
business partner

680
00:36:24,460 --> 00:36:27,530
web sites or Yahoo or Google whatever

681
00:36:27,530 --> 00:36:31,040
you focus on that out on that you do
that I would avoid don't filter out

682
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:33,359
ranges that are associated with hosting
services

683
00:36:33,359 --> 00:36:36,500
what you want to filter out all Amazon
space because there's

684
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:40,000
on in the end though Air India those
hosting providers were you can

685
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:44,880
a you can easily set up shop an attacker
may use it to

686
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:48,700
um make sure that you to test that you
can actually use this data

687
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:52,200
or you have to do our unit before you
get in a situation where you have to use

688
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:52,800
that

689
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:56,349
and also further ensure that you have
the HCP he

690
00:36:56,349 --> 00:37:00,680
so that you're basically logs that if
you get a hit safe in two months ago

691
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:04,300
%uh you go back in time and you say
while the this I didn't know this was a

692
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:05,579
commanding told us

693
00:37:05,579 --> 00:37:09,280
but ok wearing my logs and I noticed the
two months ago I had a system that was

694
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:11,310
going to that address bus stops

695
00:37:11,310 --> 00:37:14,490
usually look at that system because it
may have been infected and

696
00:37:14,490 --> 00:37:18,369
maybe now it's that attacker uninstall
the back door but it may still

697
00:37:18,369 --> 00:37:21,820
you may still need to rebuild that
system the back door may be on that

698
00:37:21,820 --> 00:37:25,849
um only you can use this implemented a
learning capability

699
00:37:25,849 --> 00:37:29,050
a so if you have a at sacher this active
in the environment

700
00:37:29,050 --> 00:37:32,460
even if you don't have a lot of us to
get all the things that up look like the

701
00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:33,579
recently was

702
00:37:33,579 --> 00:37:37,750
they include a alerting capability where
the attacker was not active

703
00:37:37,750 --> 00:37:40,810
the nude c2 the c2 IP addresses were

704
00:37:40,810 --> 00:37:44,079
and they knew that the data size was
Bowie's between you know

705
00:37:44,079 --> 00:37:49,540
8805 bites about felt so this template
alerts at any time this packet sizes

706
00:37:49,540 --> 00:37:50,940
above 105

707
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:55,310
send me a text message and I it worked
there were there was a a time when there

708
00:37:55,310 --> 00:37:57,470
was an activity where the attacker came
back

709
00:37:57,470 --> 00:38:00,460
I came back I basically mean use the
command control and the structure

710
00:38:00,460 --> 00:38:02,599
actually take control that system

711
00:38:02,599 --> 00:38:08,810
up the back door was all and those was
infected people

712
00:38:08,810 --> 00:38:12,329
next about tracking domain name
resolution times

713
00:38:12,329 --> 00:38:16,890
so this is an excerpt up screenshot that
I i I set eyes out what the tools that

714
00:38:16,890 --> 00:38:17,970
we use internally

715
00:38:17,970 --> 00:38:21,180
no investigations an arm and serves
clients attract network

716
00:38:21,180 --> 00:38:24,540
up no traffic so it's basically showing

717
00:38:24,540 --> 00:38:27,540
a successful DNS resolution response

718
00:38:27,540 --> 00:38:30,079
so we actually don't write the queers a
track with when that with a response

719
00:38:30,079 --> 00:38:31,200
comes back we're

720
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:35,200
local that response and the so bottom
line is

721
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:39,020
a particular system so this requesting
DNS server

722
00:38:39,020 --> 00:38:43,599
a seven and six five four three two one
requested and successfully resolved

723
00:38:43,599 --> 00:38:47,160
really bad net dot com and this was the

724
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:50,730
authoritative DNS server that's not
really that important

725
00:38:50,730 --> 00:38:55,119
so here's one case if this is the way
your DNS works your organization then

726
00:38:55,119 --> 00:38:57,220
you're lucky because this is a simple
case

727
00:38:57,220 --> 00:39:01,400
so infected system queried their DNS
server

728
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:05,079
which relate the query out to the
internet went through its burgers and if

729
00:39:05,079 --> 00:39:07,369
necessary and then came back

730
00:39:07,369 --> 00:39:12,220
so what you up when you get that a
lurker you an alert from maybe

731
00:39:12,220 --> 00:39:16,700
a maybe the government in the case a a
notification to hey this is really bad

732
00:39:16,700 --> 00:39:17,670
dot com

733
00:39:17,670 --> 00:39:21,230
is bad you need to look for all systems
go into that

734
00:39:21,230 --> 00:39:25,040
and a

735
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:28,420
so a continual we always fix that what's
going on

736
00:39:28,420 --> 00:39:31,980
um issues in up

737
00:39:31,980 --> 00:39:37,790
I get to get some help here they are
chances are gone off

738
00:39:37,790 --> 00:39:40,849
the screens up yet what you talkin so

739
00:39:40,849 --> 00:39:45,690
the basically the this is infected going
out to one DNS server

740
00:39:45,690 --> 00:39:49,089
so you wanna have laws on that one a DNS
server

741
00:39:49,089 --> 00:39:53,500
in order to

742
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:57,260
but lotta little

743
00:39:57,260 --> 00:40:00,670
by that you

744
00:40:00,670 --> 00:40:06,220
that's it

745
00:40:06,220 --> 00:40:10,200
the whole so basically you'll have laws
on the system

746
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:14,910
because it you're not gonna be logging
DNS do you need to know

747
00:40:14,910 --> 00:40:17,630
who queried that so my network mother
that I pointed out was sitting right

748
00:40:17,630 --> 00:40:19,140
here

749
00:40:19,140 --> 00:40:22,180
so we know that someone in the
organization is all this bad domain

750
00:40:22,180 --> 00:40:25,200
we don't know who in order to figure out
who

751
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:29,520
you have a login associates the her
client that made that word

752
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:32,760
more commonly looks like this which
means that and you know the global

753
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:33,790
company

754
00:40:33,790 --> 00:40:36,839
your public point your local dimming
control over their us

755
00:40:36,839 --> 00:40:40,960
which makes sense their public 12 some
regional also pointed to something just

756
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:44,220
some on you get to the edge what you
wanna make sure is that

757
00:40:44,220 --> 00:40:48,280
on the system's where your and points to
resolving DNS those are you want logs to

758
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:49,990
be in all those it was a

759
00:40:49,990 --> 00:40:54,440
because if some risk wearing a data a
domain name and you may be looking for

760
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:57,920
that your friend or you want to be able
to follow up quickly in determining who

761
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:01,180
is that system if it's something like
this words up

762
00:41:01,180 --> 00:41:04,369
a domain and that's definitively
socially with an hour that it's not

763
00:41:04,369 --> 00:41:05,430
common domain

764
00:41:05,430 --> 00:41:08,599
it's probably bad this is public but did

765
00:41:08,599 --> 00:41:13,060
he I'll love to always get that

766
00:41:13,060 --> 00:41:17,589
so you can log this at a web proxy that
can be helpful as well as the easier to

767
00:41:17,589 --> 00:41:17,940
do

768
00:41:17,940 --> 00:41:21,020
the domain but then what do DNS logging
on your up

769
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:25,349
yessir first Microsoft really makes it a
pain because it the way they

770
00:41:25,349 --> 00:41:28,319
your age we had to generate this flat
file and then pick it up and it is a

771
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:29,220
that's really the only

772
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:32,410
or whether I know do it if you're logged
you're doing DNS %uh

773
00:41:32,410 --> 00:41:36,530
resolution on your domain controllers up
if you have a purpose built appliances

774
00:41:36,530 --> 00:41:39,990
and they're so coming to work with um
that that have the purpose-built

775
00:41:39,990 --> 00:41:43,210
DNS and DHCP appliances those make it a
lot more

776
00:41:43,210 --> 00:41:46,859
%uh streamline ordered them to my
blogging um

777
00:41:46,859 --> 00:41:49,359
if the volume of data because
prohibitive when you start talking and

778
00:41:49,359 --> 00:41:52,450
the global companies about logging this
the network guys usually

779
00:41:52,450 --> 00:41:55,770
laugh at you and/or throw stuff at you
because this you know

780
00:41:55,770 --> 00:41:58,910
reporter DNS servers need them generates
you know

781
00:41:58,910 --> 00:42:02,380
a gigabyte and information it by queries
every 15

782
00:42:02,380 --> 00:42:06,410
seconds and stuff our what you can do is
filter out events that are associated

783
00:42:06,410 --> 00:42:07,630
with your internal that

784
00:42:07,630 --> 00:42:12,109
lookups and then any common ones like me
you know your Microsoft who ya who

785
00:42:12,109 --> 00:42:15,230
your business partners you don't need to
know which is almost

786
00:42:15,230 --> 00:42:18,550
I'll in my experience that people
throughout the interlink lookups that'll

787
00:42:18,550 --> 00:42:20,640
get don't care about fifty percent

788
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:23,829
you should be able to this with the
collector before it even goes into the

789
00:42:23,829 --> 00:42:25,339
system so you don't even have a network

790
00:42:25,339 --> 00:42:30,119
I'll I'll make sure at a little bit
times but on this

791
00:42:30,119 --> 00:42:34,040
so the fifth capability is a identifying
indicators a compromise across

792
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:38,480
the while and so

793
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:42,680
this is really %uh be a game changer on
you have this capability because without

794
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:44,060
this capability

795
00:42:44,060 --> 00:42:48,060
you it you even really smart
investigators that worked with

796
00:42:48,060 --> 00:42:52,130
don't have a capability to you extend
their reach across the company

797
00:42:52,130 --> 00:42:56,760
are very limited in what they can do so
as you're investigating you're finding

798
00:42:56,760 --> 00:43:00,060
indicators a up was it solves let

799
00:43:00,060 --> 00:43:03,599
you wanna be able to acquire your entire
environment that data

800
00:43:03,599 --> 00:43:06,800
%uh and in this is not something that's
easy to do

801
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:10,470
at their arse are some I'll tools out
there that are purpose-built the

802
00:43:10,470 --> 00:43:13,540
that have been designed for this purpose
that you can use you can also repurpose

803
00:43:13,540 --> 00:43:15,970
a lot of other tools that you may
already have to do

804
00:43:15,970 --> 00:43:19,970
a lot a this oh and then there's also
options that include scripting

805
00:43:19,970 --> 00:43:23,900
a partial w/o by are being a some
examples

806
00:43:23,900 --> 00:43:27,190
bowler ability scanners up the ideas you
want to be able to

807
00:43:27,190 --> 00:43:31,150
query environment say I have this thing
that indicates this isn't stopping buses

808
00:43:31,150 --> 00:43:34,599
registry key or up not marry artifact of
I'll

809
00:43:34,599 --> 00:43:37,740
our find out where where's that anywhere
as a it

810
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:41,079
if you have this registry key I will
look at your system because you're

811
00:43:41,079 --> 00:43:45,750
you know you may pick up a must um so
there's a couple different

812
00:43:45,750 --> 00:43:48,530
ways you can think about indicators on
indicator to be something that's very

813
00:43:48,530 --> 00:43:49,690
specific

814
00:43:49,690 --> 00:43:52,890
to a tool to a particular %uh intrusion

815
00:43:52,890 --> 00:43:56,790
%uh or maybe something this general so
maybe general bad it's like if you if

816
00:43:56,790 --> 00:43:58,619
you've ever messed around with the up

817
00:43:58,619 --> 00:44:01,910
the all-around tall from Sysinternals
all those gonna

818
00:44:01,910 --> 00:44:05,440
those lunch at the run keys in the other
the other places were

819
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:09,230
I'll the Reg your programs an autostart
thats

820
00:44:09,230 --> 00:44:12,359
one example of a generic indicator would
be let me look through those things

821
00:44:12,359 --> 00:44:14,410
looking almost like to have

822
00:44:14,410 --> 00:44:17,760
you know very basic one that pet slowing

823
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:21,790
commodity dollars do I have that any
anything running or anything that's

824
00:44:21,790 --> 00:44:24,230
persist in those keys that references
the temp directory

825
00:44:24,230 --> 00:44:28,160
that's here you know to have the
processes running that the path

826
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:31,849
is internet whatever of that's that

827
00:44:31,849 --> 00:44:34,849
public that so you can

828
00:44:34,849 --> 00:44:39,270
you can use you look for specific now or
I want two things that we also do

829
00:44:39,270 --> 00:44:42,630
as we're doing investigations the user
the great what's called

830
00:44:42,630 --> 00:44:45,920
although known bad indicators that so
it's basically

831
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:49,119
as we're learning more about what's
going on environment were added to that

832
00:44:49,119 --> 00:44:52,380
and we can look across the Marmon
getting sleepy checking or

833
00:44:52,380 --> 00:44:55,910
or missing so we know that it and
there's these twenty things that

834
00:44:55,910 --> 00:45:00,260
are related to this particular intrusion
if we keep looking what we wanna see is

835
00:45:00,260 --> 00:45:03,690
we know everything so every time we look
we want to say okay ep

836
00:45:03,690 --> 00:45:07,780
about 10 systems have that artifact we
know about outside ok everything's good

837
00:45:07,780 --> 00:45:08,930
we know about those tender

838
00:45:08,930 --> 00:45:13,440
XOM not were running it and we identify
five things the five new ones

839
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:17,560
I'm a meanie attackers the lock tavern
museum missus all

840
00:45:17,560 --> 00:45:20,790
so this is the example that I want to
use that how to explain this

841
00:45:20,790 --> 00:45:24,369
up that this process so if you picture
servers com

842
00:45:24,369 --> 00:45:27,890
as infected so in it's got back door
underscore

843
00:45:27,890 --> 00:45:32,329
K and communicating with bad domain dot
com which clearly resolved to

844
00:45:32,329 --> 00:45:36,760
is before us 223 34 5678

845
00:45:36,760 --> 00:45:40,540
a you go back doors running as a most
lol

846
00:45:40,540 --> 00:45:43,950
its associated with the legitimate
Windows service so I'll

847
00:45:43,950 --> 00:45:47,109
very commonly adult the they're all

848
00:45:47,109 --> 00:45:50,770
there will be a list of services that a
particular reason our may hijack

849
00:45:50,770 --> 00:45:55,280
I'll this one happens to be using this
remote around and relax a service

850
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:59,050
and you also though through your
investigation that

851
00:45:59,050 --> 00:46:03,839
it after use this service a cow to
communicate to a file server

852
00:46:03,839 --> 00:46:07,410
so what you wanna get outta this are you
want to look for

853
00:46:07,410 --> 00:46:13,140
host a syndicators what we look or in
our case indicators or think about is

854
00:46:13,140 --> 00:46:18,290
what out of here can help identify
listen to that problem also

855
00:46:18,290 --> 00:46:21,720
some other things that can indicate that
from a network perspective so

856
00:46:21,720 --> 00:46:25,700
if you see any successful packets
destined for this IP address

857
00:46:25,700 --> 00:46:29,810
that's something we'll look into lessons
probably copper bus

858
00:46:29,810 --> 00:46:33,079
it may not be though it may be a false
positive it may be.

859
00:46:33,079 --> 00:46:36,210
a web hosting environment up and the
attacker does happen to be reading

860
00:46:36,210 --> 00:46:37,010
specialist

861
00:46:37,010 --> 00:46:40,230
a server that's got a lot of other are
legitimate sites

862
00:46:40,230 --> 00:46:43,579
in DNS queries or anything you see in
your web proxy

863
00:46:43,579 --> 00:46:47,420
that that domain that's probably awesome
some Asian look into

864
00:46:47,420 --> 00:46:51,220
is an issue to look into is if you
understand how this back door at a

865
00:46:51,220 --> 00:46:55,270
communicate over the network you can
looks or

866
00:46:55,270 --> 00:46:58,710
pattern specific to that protocol see
that require some

867
00:46:58,710 --> 00:47:01,940
some more advanced capabilities in terms
of being able to understand how the

868
00:47:01,940 --> 00:47:03,380
Bowers actually working

869
00:47:03,380 --> 00:47:06,380
that something they can you really
powerful as well because that way

870
00:47:06,380 --> 00:47:09,700
if he comes out with a back door
underscored the that

871
00:47:09,700 --> 00:47:12,849
looks different but the a tough
different this that you're not finding

872
00:47:12,849 --> 00:47:15,579
it and and enough different that you are
finding it based on other hosts are

873
00:47:15,579 --> 00:47:16,390
facts

874
00:47:16,390 --> 00:47:20,470
you may see their profile at an
investigation last year where

875
00:47:20,470 --> 00:47:25,390
others and Zachary seen year after year
and yet we detected so he is using

876
00:47:25,390 --> 00:47:28,609
all new tools but love the tools you use
using happened

877
00:47:28,609 --> 00:47:32,200
the basically riddance same network
protocol I probably just

878
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:35,740
get copied and pasted that model so even
though it was brand new

879
00:47:35,740 --> 00:47:39,520
we were able to immediately pick up that
the system was infected

880
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:43,400
%uh and it was this particular up to

881
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:47,079
Yahoo space indicators so these are very
time poll

882
00:47:47,079 --> 00:47:51,109
up so these I would hang my hat on but
I'm starting with to the z1 so

883
00:47:51,109 --> 00:47:55,170
if the system as an established TCP
connection up

884
00:47:55,170 --> 00:47:59,559
so that the host Bayside at that network
indicator of talking to see two

885
00:47:59,559 --> 00:48:02,589
are more if the DNS cache contains that
domain

886
00:48:02,589 --> 00:48:05,680
a you can't worry that the offer with
the with was

887
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:09,270
with the scripts you could probably do
it using

888
00:48:09,270 --> 00:48:13,180
using II a

889
00:48:13,180 --> 00:48:16,380
host a syndicators continued so other
things will look for other that we

890
00:48:16,380 --> 00:48:17,309
talked about

891
00:48:17,309 --> 00:48:20,180
the security event log contains
successful application from this

892
00:48:20,180 --> 00:48:21,490
proposed a Cal

893
00:48:21,490 --> 00:48:25,880
or if it contains a lot of them server
at a so this is ravenous them

894
00:48:25,880 --> 00:48:28,990
being able to look to the loggers is
going to really help you identify other

895
00:48:28,990 --> 00:48:30,170
systems

896
00:48:30,170 --> 00:48:35,119
I'll another thing is that you know from
your analysis uva/uvb this observer a

897
00:48:35,119 --> 00:48:39,599
that this particular out it's a server a
service persistence mechanism and so

898
00:48:39,599 --> 00:48:42,839
there's a registry key that references
that there's a particular DLL

899
00:48:42,839 --> 00:48:46,780
name it's not a you know the name of the
names differ you might of on it but

900
00:48:46,780 --> 00:48:50,260
you can look for this sneaky ID lol a in
the

901
00:48:50,260 --> 00:48:54,760
in the may fun that's an hour so other
things you look for in somebody's r

902
00:48:54,760 --> 00:48:56,200
Butler bass and this is really

903
00:48:56,200 --> 00:48:59,430
waterways that I'll is your

904
00:48:59,430 --> 00:49:02,579
the more customizable do this in the
more you're able to extend your reach

905
00:49:02,579 --> 00:49:04,099
different tools

906
00:49:04,099 --> 00:49:07,450
this'll make your investigation even
more complete because you'll

907
00:49:07,450 --> 00:49:10,599
will be able to get a better grasp of
what's going on

908
00:49:10,599 --> 00:49:14,119
some other things you look for well as
md5 hash

909
00:49:14,119 --> 00:49:18,190
matches the exact the law well Santa
buyers can do this

910
00:49:18,190 --> 00:49:22,329
a there's other ways you do but you know
most companies

911
00:49:22,329 --> 00:49:26,500
that a farce I'll mostly across the
Windows environment so

912
00:49:26,500 --> 00:49:29,130
you to look for that but the problem of
course is that there's anything

913
00:49:29,130 --> 00:49:30,180
different about you know

914
00:49:30,180 --> 00:49:34,119
on that law another thing that you can
think about is OK

915
00:49:34,119 --> 00:49:38,260
this particular file out as a compiled
piles time step that's that's that's

916
00:49:38,260 --> 00:49:39,160
this

917
00:49:39,160 --> 00:49:43,150
and as the size so there may be very
into this DLL

918
00:49:43,150 --> 00:49:46,230
thats are different and

919
00:49:46,230 --> 00:49:50,510
75 it's not a match but they're pretty
much the same thing

920
00:49:50,510 --> 00:49:53,690
octial she

921
00:49:53,690 --> 00:49:58,380
I'll I so they make experience

922
00:49:58,380 --> 00:50:00,569
and other things you can do in this is
getting more day you're gonna have to

923
00:50:00,569 --> 00:50:02,559
have some capability to really
understand an hour

924
00:50:02,559 --> 00:50:06,500
there may be a unique combination up
option imports

925
00:50:06,500 --> 00:50:09,730
that you can use to use a that it's
likely

926
00:50:09,730 --> 00:50:13,490
%uh you're gonna have some false
positives and this %uh this may require

927
00:50:13,490 --> 00:50:16,880
some more advanced tools or scripting to
do

928
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:20,609
up basically looking for the fingerprint
but for example you know that a

929
00:50:20,609 --> 00:50:24,200
password hash numbers going to have to
important these

930
00:50:24,200 --> 00:50:28,359
10 when those fortunes to do its work
you could combine that

931
00:50:28,359 --> 00:50:32,859
with a some other information to try and
catch

932
00:50:32,859 --> 00:50:35,990
other tools that are probably doing the
same thing

933
00:50:35,990 --> 00:50:39,119
up read you gonna get more also causes
but I can work

934
00:50:39,119 --> 00:50:42,329
the other thing you can do is looking
for okay you know that the when the

935
00:50:42,329 --> 00:50:46,150
within hours running that as our new tax
that it uses to make sure that

936
00:50:46,150 --> 00:50:49,180
some venture to the stars about two
times

937
00:50:49,180 --> 00:50:53,170
if the attacker like to reuse code wall
you know just cut paste from the library

938
00:50:53,170 --> 00:50:53,640
that

939
00:50:53,640 --> 00:50:57,040
you may find that this is helpful so

940
00:50:57,040 --> 00:51:00,650
to really to really do this I you first

941
00:51:00,650 --> 00:51:03,920
identify indicators through forensic
analysis and

942
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:07,510
network analysis and then you need to
have this

943
00:51:07,510 --> 00:51:10,910
capability to go out across the bar

944
00:51:10,910 --> 00:51:14,410
so I mention antivirus Antivirus is
definitely one way that you can look

945
00:51:14,410 --> 00:51:16,089
around and the five Ashes

946
00:51:16,089 --> 00:51:19,390
up sometimes you can look for other
attributes a

947
00:51:19,390 --> 00:51:21,770
from a network perspective you may be
able to do something with those pix

948
00:51:21,770 --> 00:51:25,050
firewalls the pendulum model Seattle
mother

949
00:51:25,050 --> 00:51:29,220
system configuration management software
so if you have

950
00:51:29,220 --> 00:51:32,380
third-party tools with their party
running but non-microsoft I'll mention

951
00:51:32,380 --> 00:51:33,760
SCCM

952
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:37,420
up software inventory is one way if
you're looking for specific registry key

953
00:51:37,420 --> 00:51:40,780
are you can use models that were
designed for licensing compliance to

954
00:51:40,780 --> 00:51:42,210
basically go out tell you

955
00:51:42,210 --> 00:51:46,170
was that he if you do that keep in mind
that the data that you're wearing

956
00:51:46,170 --> 00:51:50,089
might not be current might represent
that state you know a week ago when the

957
00:51:50,089 --> 00:51:51,650
data was collected

958
00:51:51,650 --> 00:51:54,829
I'll you can also use if you have third
party tools that

959
00:51:54,829 --> 00:51:58,200
that used to manage software you can go
out and and an

960
00:51:58,200 --> 00:52:02,550
oftentimes the lineup a query that you
can look for a file or registry key or

961
00:52:02,550 --> 00:52:03,980
something like that

962
00:52:03,980 --> 00:52:07,619
%uh network intrusion detection systems

963
00:52:07,619 --> 00:52:10,690
very helpful if your IP addresses that
you're looking for

964
00:52:10,690 --> 00:52:14,680
%uh domain names you can write custom

965
00:52:14,680 --> 00:52:18,420
signatures for any protocols and red
it's gonna take some more awesome organs

966
00:52:18,420 --> 00:52:20,000
capabilities to do that

967
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:23,210
those to be very helpful on the same
we've talked about

968
00:52:23,210 --> 00:52:27,150
some a suburb or Billy scanners have
modules that you can repurpose

969
00:52:27,150 --> 00:52:30,680
ought to look for some these artifacts
so a lot alike

970
00:52:30,680 --> 00:52:34,099
like at seen one that it's a module

971
00:52:34,099 --> 00:52:39,030
where you can look for likable like for
software licensing tell me if XYZ since

972
00:52:39,030 --> 00:52:41,430
all the model works but checking for
registry key

973
00:52:41,430 --> 00:52:45,079
you can use that look for now our
absolve them also have the ability to

974
00:52:45,079 --> 00:52:47,050
look for a specific process

975
00:52:47,050 --> 00:52:51,200
or look for specific file on this so if
you have it just

976
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:54,970
think outside the box about the tools
that you already have at and that'll be

977
00:52:54,970 --> 00:52:58,930
I'll helpful before you run out to go
buy something

978
00:52:58,930 --> 00:53:01,980
up by something else PowerShell W Myers
EW

979
00:53:01,980 --> 00:53:06,260
is is there are a lot like work there's
there's there are some

980
00:53:06,260 --> 00:53:09,780
some publicly available %uh scripts I
had bought some links

981
00:53:09,780 --> 00:53:12,920
in the and notes and in the white paper
that's on the CD

982
00:53:12,920 --> 00:53:16,170
up but I thought it might number my
research for this that can be

983
00:53:16,170 --> 00:53:19,520
a they can be helpful up or ship the
PowerShell

984
00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:23,390
assault systems you do that are that of
course this personal

985
00:53:23,390 --> 00:53:27,599
personal tools so there to wrap up I
wanna make sure

986
00:53:27,599 --> 00:53:30,760
local minutes the questions ourselves
anyway everyone

987
00:53:30,760 --> 00:53:34,910
and up the drinks up develops and use
cases

988
00:53:34,910 --> 00:53:39,200
um don't let the tool dictator process
you need to make sure that your

989
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:42,710
the processes in your needs is
investigators dictate the tools

990
00:53:42,710 --> 00:53:46,180
so the German what capabilities you need
for for your apartment

991
00:53:46,180 --> 00:53:50,630
%uh and then on these cases you're out
what you can do with your existing tools

992
00:53:50,630 --> 00:53:53,660
and then figure out if there's anything
else that you need to add

993
00:53:53,660 --> 00:53:57,500
up rather than doing it the other way
around there's no there's no

994
00:53:57,500 --> 00:54:01,300
no one tool is going to solve your
problems is not a tool problem it's a

995
00:54:01,300 --> 00:54:05,490
you need process ease and you need a an
understanding what's going on what

996
00:54:05,490 --> 00:54:06,270
you're looking for

997
00:54:06,270 --> 00:54:10,079
others a not a single call I'll

998
00:54:10,079 --> 00:54:13,750
also and instead it as a as a final
thought that they

999
00:54:13,750 --> 00:54:17,339
at as as I was writing my paper in the
really big picture this

1000
00:54:17,339 --> 00:54:21,109
I would make sure that from an IR
perspective that your you're monitoring

1001
00:54:21,109 --> 00:54:25,329
in capturing metrics that are useful and
that useful to measure

1002
00:54:25,329 --> 00:54:29,300
how your programs improving as well as
help you get support for getting some of

1003
00:54:29,300 --> 00:54:31,109
these additional capabilities like

1004
00:54:31,109 --> 00:54:34,690
if your butt measuring how long does it
take us from the time that we detect

1005
00:54:34,690 --> 00:54:35,200
something

1006
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:39,440
is she to win is actually up contained
on the network

1007
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:43,200
that's helpful in that can you can use
that type better to show

1008
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:48,609
on how you're improving are also show
the benefit if we had had XYZ capability

1009
00:54:48,609 --> 00:54:51,670
we could have maybe done this faster
than the attacker would avoid a must but

1010
00:54:51,670 --> 00:54:52,559
since that

1011
00:54:52,559 --> 00:54:56,809
and it wouldn't storms data %uh that
also means under the tax so

1012
00:54:56,809 --> 00:55:00,990
along with the attacker in your car
every every organization is

1013
00:55:00,990 --> 00:55:04,549
is vulnerable to getting Papa must up
the attackers determined enough

1014
00:55:04,549 --> 00:55:08,170
I don't believe that something which up
enterprise-scale that you can prevent

1015
00:55:08,170 --> 00:55:12,369
the initial pablo's which one thing
about as how fast can you stop it

1016
00:55:12,369 --> 00:55:16,190
so unit companies that are very they're
very mature capabilities

1017
00:55:16,190 --> 00:55:19,940
still there's gonna be some 0 day or
something they have patched they're

1018
00:55:19,940 --> 00:55:20,460
gonna get

1019
00:55:20,460 --> 00:55:23,960
missed the National applause will happen
but from that point

1020
00:55:23,960 --> 00:55:28,040
they're able to detect that in a matter
of hours usually not as bad

1021
00:55:28,040 --> 00:55:31,430
than it notes the cases some
organizations with a couple months for

1022
00:55:31,430 --> 00:55:32,130
years and

1023
00:55:32,130 --> 00:55:35,150
don't know it until someone knocks on
the door

1024
00:55:35,150 --> 00:55:38,540
so without all up to she questions and

1025
00:55:38,540 --> 00:55:45,540
thank you very much for your attention
skin

1026
00:55:54,960 --> 00:55:58,290
I will there's no questions thanks again
I'll be around during the

1027
00:55:58,290 --> 00:56:05,290
you know the next hour and a half the at
the all-star thanks

1028
00:56:09,640 --> 00:56:15,250
yep

1029
00:56:15,250 --> 00:56:18,960
should sorry guys I'm just one question

1030
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:22,809
gene Singapore breezy choir member do
happen to you are so much more stations

1031
00:56:22,809 --> 00:56:23,569
precious efforts

1032
00:56:23,569 --> 00:56:28,790
the service its many cases right now and
you are still do more harm than good

1033
00:56:28,790 --> 00:56:32,089
meaning that charges wants to be I'm and
myself

1034
00:56:32,089 --> 00:56:35,440
antivirus myron cleanup system basically

1035
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:38,880
your removing all traces certainly
you're going to pick up printed

1036
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:41,930
I'm sedition yet so I i've seen that be
in

1037
00:56:41,930 --> 00:56:45,869
Minister generally I don't I would find
it to be a problem we have in our sole

1038
00:56:45,869 --> 00:56:46,490
everywhere

1039
00:56:46,490 --> 00:56:49,650
um I will by county I would be

1040
00:56:49,650 --> 00:56:53,079
if I would make sure that whatever files
quarantines

1041
00:56:53,079 --> 00:56:57,329
it it did take or jeans them rather than
just a leading cause I have run into

1042
00:56:57,329 --> 00:56:59,140
that problem where deletes

1043
00:56:59,140 --> 00:57:04,040
%uh police the evidence but a lot of
times I i find an anti virus doesn't

1044
00:57:04,040 --> 00:57:05,430
detect love this

1045
00:57:05,430 --> 00:57:09,760
um actually reviewing your antivirus
logs for knowledge can be one way to rid

1046
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:11,410
really practically

1047
00:57:11,410 --> 00:57:15,059
well are attractive but really
effectively detect the middle of Sony's

1048
00:57:15,059 --> 00:57:16,099
compromises where

1049
00:57:16,099 --> 00:57:19,900
at Antivirus is pretty good it's acting
I'll some types of

1050
00:57:19,900 --> 00:57:24,299
like mast a market credentialed Oberst
assert the use a generic p2p job ratchet

1051
00:57:24,299 --> 00:57:26,119
up for something that you can detect
that

1052
00:57:26,119 --> 00:57:29,450
on so I would recommend you know come on
the on the antivirus note

1053
00:57:29,450 --> 00:57:32,549
make sure that your triage process has
something in it

1054
00:57:32,549 --> 00:57:36,170
another a note where the analyst should
consider

1055
00:57:36,170 --> 00:57:40,010
whether this may be part of something
bigger rather than just saying okay yep

1056
00:57:40,010 --> 00:57:43,530
it got caught let's up what's up let's
rebuild it

1057
00:57:43,530 --> 00:57:46,650
that's the default answer most the
company's gone our rebuild it

1058
00:57:46,650 --> 00:57:50,079
whereas you may be missing the fact that
that was the sign that the guys in your

1059
00:57:50,079 --> 00:57:54,849
environment that the decorative arts

1060
00:57:54,849 --> 00:58:00,730
the other questions

1061
00:58:00,730 --> 00:58:05,579
so all these all these the I'm kind of
an ice is based on the

1062
00:58:05,579 --> 00:58:09,160
use that as a result akin to a sofa

1063
00:58:09,160 --> 00:58:13,260
connected to you all inside I'm how do
you didn't deter me

1064
00:58:13,260 --> 00:58:19,990
this is a control so far not

1065
00:58:19,990 --> 00:58:24,230
on thats a much bigger a much bigger
topic but it's definitely I

1066
00:58:24,230 --> 00:58:27,730
a good topic what I would say is that
okay

1067
00:58:27,730 --> 00:58:31,650
its it's really hard to actually go back
in the we used this is a wait so if you

1068
00:58:31,650 --> 00:58:32,980
look at the attack by cycle

1069
00:58:32,980 --> 00:58:37,910
love the way this is targeted but
targeted tax

1070
00:58:37,910 --> 00:58:41,520
initial compromise your you're probably
not gonna be able to detect that

1071
00:58:41,520 --> 00:58:44,829
I mean if you could if somebody had some
tool that you can reliably detect that

1072
00:58:44,829 --> 00:58:46,660
than others other stuff what happened

1073
00:58:46,660 --> 00:58:49,130
there's always going to be something
that gets exploited that you know some

1074
00:58:49,130 --> 00:58:50,720
patches not applied

1075
00:58:50,720 --> 00:58:54,849
this is going to be difficult to detect
I establishing pothole

1076
00:58:54,849 --> 00:58:58,460
from okay this this is something where
in

1077
00:58:58,460 --> 00:59:02,339
it's not easy but if you look for common
ways that now or Perseus on systems

1078
00:59:02,339 --> 00:59:05,710
that's one good way that you can detect
these useful holes

1079
00:59:05,710 --> 00:59:08,849
so a back door that install by looking
for

1080
00:59:08,849 --> 00:59:11,960
anomalies Eunos anomalous running
service

1081
00:59:11,960 --> 00:59:15,319
a up it a anomalous

1082
00:59:15,319 --> 00:59:19,839
um a process that has anomalous
connection based on

1083
00:59:19,839 --> 00:59:23,420
intelligence that you have which can now
that's it's difficult difficult to know

1084
00:59:23,420 --> 00:59:24,130
so

1085
00:59:24,130 --> 00:59:27,400
in your industry there may be a
particular balls that well like I know

1086
00:59:27,400 --> 00:59:30,869
up in United States and certain
industries they have

1087
00:59:30,869 --> 00:59:34,809
up working group with a share
information on attacks and you can look

1088
00:59:34,809 --> 00:59:35,990
for something that's

1089
00:59:35,990 --> 00:59:39,280
you're seeing same thing that they're
saying another company

1090
00:59:39,280 --> 00:59:42,740
I'll escalating

1091
00:59:42,740 --> 00:59:45,790
escalating privilege is also difficult
to detect a separate your anti-virus

1092
00:59:45,790 --> 00:59:46,750
happened to catch

1093
00:59:46,750 --> 00:59:49,859
%uh credentialed upper um

1094
00:59:49,859 --> 00:59:53,430
I think a lotta lotta they can be caught
in

1095
00:59:53,430 --> 00:59:57,180
IMU latte with the attackers moving
laterally with an environment if you

1096
00:59:57,180 --> 01:00:00,839
if you know what account should be going
to wear but almost nobody in

1097
01:00:00,839 --> 01:00:04,599
no nobody knows that you would know puts
the novel's use an account because

1098
01:00:04,599 --> 01:00:07,880
nobody except for the person who was
that application knows that what that

1099
01:00:07,880 --> 01:00:09,710
account supposed to be doing

1100
01:00:09,710 --> 01:00:15,260
um but it at its you really just have to
have to have a a combination of

1101
01:00:15,260 --> 01:00:18,790
proactively going through your
environment looking for signs

1102
01:00:18,790 --> 01:00:22,220
love up anomalous activity

1103
01:00:22,220 --> 01:00:25,430
from a network perspective the host
perspective that also applies much

1104
01:00:25,430 --> 01:00:27,640
outside intelligence you can get about

1105
01:00:27,640 --> 01:00:31,069
what's bad up that it can change so of
the

1106
01:00:31,069 --> 01:00:36,790
certain certain types of threats

1107
01:00:36,790 --> 01:00:43,790
any other questions

1108
01:00:47,690 --> 01:00:50,220
okay thank you very much Paul

1109
01:00:50,220 --> 01:00:51,670
