their car I'm

6
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:23,580
protocol okay in that case you're gonna
be comparing the focus to make combos

7
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:27,769
portable that these units within their
the car snow the case

8
00:00:27,769 --> 00:00:30,840
so im

9
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:34,250

my a bad day is very offensive fun

31
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:55,360
I love breaking everything
hardware/software

32
00:01:55,360 --> 00:02:01,899
I like Messina leg this I about I
realize my girlfriend so yeah

33

liar you here today reagan announced
that they're being in the swimming pool

42
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:41,970
and with this brilliant yeah

43
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:47,170
girls okay so that's their

okay cool that's them

45
00:02:50,739 --> 00:02:54,209
day index those are the top aides that
we're going to speak about today

46
00:02:54,209 --> 00:02:58,120
we're gonna deaths do I a small the mind
about Caroline

47
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:02,480
and their we're gonna speak about what
is the common things that

48
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:06,250
we can buy today very I mean not

49
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:09,450
not tip not to put all but we can buy

50
00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:14,650
some spyware to interrupt do it without
a car so we can both salmon stocks

51
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:20,170
bad France that was not enough right so
we just wanted to post something

52
00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:23,250
cheaper very cheaper be cheap

53
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:27,730
sorry and and been able to

54
00:03:27,730 --> 00:03:31,019
explode as much as possible a min
speaking

55
00:03:31,019 --> 00:03:34,170
against the mad world itself not leg
just

56
00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:38,349
some parts of the car so where we

57
00:03:38,349 --> 00:03:41,769
with little up to we made a piece of
hardware

58
00:03:41,769 --> 00:03:45,200
that we have right here it is cold the

59
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:48,450
HD car hacking tool yeah

60
00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:51,610
is not very original I know bad the

61
00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:55,239
yeah we will speak about aid what are
the features that we have

62
00:03:55,239 --> 00:03:58,709
how can we speak directly with the Talat
with their combo say

63
00:03:58,709 --> 00:04:02,680
network and everything one of the most
important things

64
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:05,709
in my opinion at least as the
statistical analysis

65
00:04:05,709 --> 00:04:09,620
because we will see later but its car is
a different world

66
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:13,310
it's a completely different world even
be in the same brown

67
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:17,040
even using the same brand of cars is
gonna be def if not be completely

68
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:17,669
different

69
00:04:17,669 --> 00:04:20,930
the back at the the car stand BC you
sent between

70
00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:23,949
within within their combos their network

71
00:04:23,949 --> 00:04:28,240
are completely different even be in the
same although but the friend year

72
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:31,880
the packets are different so that is
something we have to deal

73
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:35,330
about and we be

74
00:04:35,330 --> 00:04:39,160
with the way out some kind of a
statistical analysis to this

75
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:42,919
go through it yeah we DA them

76
00:04:42,919 --> 00:04:46,259
kind of a back takeover will call take
over to

77
00:04:46,259 --> 00:04:49,440
you will see later and we're gonna speak
some car for an 6

78
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:53,030
yeah have this windows here about

79
00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:56,910
I'm just the me okay yeah

80
00:04:56,910 --> 00:05:01,310
I am this is the typical picture that
everybody use when

81
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:04,490
is when I speak about issues so

82
00:05:04,490 --> 00:05:07,620
basically air all the cars are Lacob

83
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:13,340
subnet of ECU's was like our car are our
house are all feel that we have the Fran

84
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:16,630
devices stay connected to our gateway or
something

85
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:20,340
in that case the devices are connected
it's a broadcast the

86
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:23,389
um network okay so yet there are

87
00:05:23,389 --> 00:05:27,660
on somebody from EC use within a car a
lot of different issues all the

88
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:31,750
ECU sir sending packets most of the time

89
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:35,910
IFN all the milliseconds every
millisecond we're gonna have some

90
00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:39,270
issue the cendien a ban Tov pockets that

91
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:43,289
we want to interpret a want to know what
this Pakistan do

92
00:05:43,289 --> 00:05:48,880
and just try to do something with them
that we will see

93
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:52,960
okay so the

94
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:58,090
knob other issues in South the it is
common that they have a set of unique

95
00:05:58,090 --> 00:05:58,850
ID's

96
00:05:58,850 --> 00:06:02,080
you decide I you should be. attach

97
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:06,360
on the cum bus not on canine and not to
a specific feature a

98
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:11,729
issue but there to our function we could
say and i'd the spot cussed in their

99
00:06:11,729 --> 00:06:12,470
core and

100
00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:16,759
engine a RPM's and others but us in this
be the

101
00:06:16,759 --> 00:06:20,479
sold maybe someday to their requests so

102
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:23,310
they're a size unique ID for each

103
00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:27,099
will call it like it type of a Taser
beats request

104
00:06:27,099 --> 00:06:30,599
the sometimes his share between ECU's

105
00:06:30,599 --> 00:06:33,999
but this is just for the cum bus as soon
as we can

106
00:06:33,999 --> 00:06:38,150
have passing request from the front
ECU's the

107
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:42,939
been when we talk about security the to
modify the film around them you should

108
00:06:42,939 --> 00:06:44,870
if you want to date they're legit way

109
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:48,409
aired a harbor some authentication
method the cdkey

110
00:06:48,409 --> 00:06:51,659
air to be bent they are now thrice

111
00:06:51,659 --> 00:06:55,499
manipulation of the fin were and

112
00:06:55,499 --> 00:07:00,009
most of the times they have some
diagnostics data is stored in them

113
00:07:00,009 --> 00:07:03,860
something seen that Brown something seen
the flash a

114
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:06,760
either for diagnosis or the

115
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:10,390
the world a just for

116
00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:15,170
data mining how the behavior of that ECU
depending on which one is

117
00:07:15,170 --> 00:07:20,390
the should be lack then air

118
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:24,160
just a quick thing earlier we talked
about the differences between come %uh

119
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:27,770
sankei lanky young is mainly diagnostics
oriented so not

120
00:07:27,770 --> 00:07:32,750
much or a need eight at all he's been
back a senate it's cheap

121
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:36,660
it walks onto a boat is basically a
Newark but level chief the to the bus to

122
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:38,250
do the length of the wires

123
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:42,780
this be the ace a usually 250 can reach
that but

124
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:46,420
it slow where most of the times 250
would be like some bench

125
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:49,740
so I mean that they can they see you out
the car itself

126
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:53,060
but the cum bus well actually

127
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:56,280
it worse est discontinued Sony

128
00:07:56,280 --> 00:08:01,520
were around 2010 the I stopped seeing it
on the Carson just to come bus

129
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:05,730
lesser so come but he's really all
that's nothing new I things from the 80s

130
00:08:05,730 --> 00:08:06,300
indeed

131
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:10,910
but they call the like the puter
technology that's okay the

132
00:08:10,910 --> 00:08:14,270
speech you behayelit 1 megabit per
second

133
00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:19,460
actually it's a slower because there are
lots of a issues broadcast in there

134
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:23,210
so it gets quite slow when you want to
do some heavy communicating

135
00:08:23,210 --> 00:08:26,780
the frame length air the me know this
yes

136
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:29,850
eight beats work a lot less up to 24 54

137
00:08:29,850 --> 00:08:33,250
beats a bite sorry sooo steel

138
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:36,490
a you need to send more frames to get
the thing so

139
00:08:36,490 --> 00:08:41,150
its it's better for their nice immunity
stuff but it's not good for the speeds

140
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:45,680
unwell we set our own the fun that it
required spends a pound were

141
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:51,170
not anymore so

142
00:08:51,170 --> 00:08:56,810
maybe give up seen the somewhere at this
was the subject of our talk

143
00:08:56,810 --> 00:09:00,460
the that's gone an Outback hat Arsenal
as well in Vegas

144
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:04,660
this is Stacy you too would be in father
developing some

145
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:07,780
features for it it to start at assess
that the Queen were

146
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:10,910
and we develop our library for the
Chelan

147
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:14,580
and we are the some functions basically
what

148
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:18,430
could be done with the main feeler but
the

149
00:09:18,430 --> 00:09:21,870
knowledge you can just make your own
cause some fear where is in the calls

150
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:25,790
in that library and where updating it
since we are using it for the

151
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:31,860
developing the main feel where Fred we
will

152
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:36,940
if you there the link for that so

153
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:40,120
okay so back to can data the

154
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:43,160
as better was saying earlier

155
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:46,830
a.m. you know people say like your kind
they taste like

156
00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:50,250
yes OECD is a Dutch treat this like you
art well actually

157
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:53,730
each car even the same although from
different years

158
00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:57,590
have the different ways of parsing the
data

159
00:09:57,590 --> 00:10:01,470
I mean the it is not the structure the
same way so you cannot

160
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:05,100
like say yeah I can read come by Stata
yeah you can read the

161
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:08,710
up to level two but you cannot we parse
the data in all the cars

162
00:10:08,710 --> 00:10:12,060
so it's not that universal than

163
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:16,130
the well it is us well run the state
that that can data

164
00:10:16,130 --> 00:10:20,480
East plane it's not like you can attach
the then you can be like speed and two

165
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,930
points and then this beat

166
00:10:21,930 --> 00:10:25,030
thats that's what I consider plane so

167
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:29,000
it's not really play needs to be parsed
steel I'm arsenic is

168
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,240
the front even from same all those
different year so

169
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:36,410
East might might not be equipped to but
this is still not plain

170
00:10:36,410 --> 00:10:39,960
and as well connie so secure

171
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:43,550
or whatever kind it's just a nice level
1&2 how can it be secure

172
00:10:43,550 --> 00:10:46,800
he says you know that there's no
security there's a kitty should be

173
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,650
implemented an amount affect their
itself

174
00:10:48,650 --> 00:10:52,330
is like saying TCPIP safe the

175
00:10:52,330 --> 00:10:57,480
it's nonsense now

176
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:01,140
this is according to our spirits the

177
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:05,580
will call like there are three kinds of
frames inside the

178
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:10,430
that goes inside the networks air will
call then diagnosis

179
00:11:10,430 --> 00:11:13,990
frames they're usually generate about
some that nurses equipments

180
00:11:13,990 --> 00:11:17,640
and a they can three-car some functions

181
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:20,870
but you should be would not happen in a
normal

182
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:24,520
environment inside the car that if your
gonna test our sample their brakes

183
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:25,300
individually

184
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:28,700
do with be both it will be possible to

185
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:31,830
the turn on any individual break own

186
00:11:31,830 --> 00:11:35,130
one will if you want to test the
steering wheel it should be possible to

187
00:11:35,130 --> 00:11:36,480
move the steering wheel

188
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:40,490
this diagnostic see but usually well you
should be you know

189
00:11:40,490 --> 00:11:43,600
if it's on us it it does not deceased
within the car itself

190
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:46,950
I mean if you don't have the tool
there's no way you're going to get those

191
00:11:46,950 --> 00:11:50,250
back its ok glance than the

192
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:53,950
system commands basically that the ones
that are

193
00:11:53,950 --> 00:11:57,470
the generated the by another ECU

194
00:11:57,470 --> 00:12:01,380
I me like that you want to open your
card you push the remote

195
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:04,560
then the whatever muddy always say like
okay

196
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:08,209
and I got a request so the lights should
turn on

197
00:12:08,209 --> 00:12:12,680
that model is sending that frame that
frame would be a system frame because it

198
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:16,450
was not triggered by the user itself but
it was triggered by another model

199
00:12:16,450 --> 00:12:19,990
as a consequence for another action so
sometimes

200
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:24,900
at this system commands are the same as
the use for once I will talk now

201
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:28,830
are even diagnosis but not every time

202
00:12:28,830 --> 00:12:33,200
then you suck months that's pretty
straight back to push about on

203
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:36,740
then some other got their request it
will broadcast the

204
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:40,390
command for that request

205
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:43,680
now a a land 327

206
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:48,440
it that's where the mosque commonly use
AI si for diagnosis

207
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:52,650
it's like you can find it on eBay for 10
euro stuff like that

208
00:12:52,650 --> 00:12:55,890
it supports a lot of protocols that I A

209
00:12:55,890 --> 00:12:59,660
near the con kWp even their peace with
my the elation

210
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:02,810
which will issue some Tylenol cars so

211
00:13:02,810 --> 00:13:06,690
and its handled by a eighty call once I
mean serio that

212
00:13:06,690 --> 00:13:10,600
it's easy to implement so the

213
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:13,620
it I'll see you soften his enhance
diagnosis

214
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:16,990
which gives you access to some security
feature nurse

215
00:13:16,990 --> 00:13:21,730
let's go this well yep orson eighty easy
to use

216
00:13:21,730 --> 00:13:26,070
but actually I will show it again

217
00:13:26,070 --> 00:13:30,470
checked this beats for the compass
desist understand that I the

218
00:13:30,470 --> 00:13:33,790
but 500 can about or 250 King about

219
00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:39,130
so what happens if you want 125 like for
some pop scene

220
00:13:39,130 --> 00:13:42,940
own son internal combustion is for frame
or four body

221
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:47,329
what happens with that you cannot use up
what happens if you have some 800 King

222
00:13:47,329 --> 00:13:48,200
about

223
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:51,870
you cannot use a if you need to do
something else

224
00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:55,209
two counts so

225
00:13:55,209 --> 00:14:01,060
the CHT what is it he says somehow were
based on that the nominee pro

226
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:04,690
that gets attached to any come bus any
speed

227
00:14:04,690 --> 00:14:08,839
the hard work that we have brought here
is of fat which missus like

228
00:14:08,839 --> 00:14:11,839
I so so looking PCB

229
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:16,709
it's the we are always air I then you
stop taking that other stuff are

230
00:14:16,709 --> 00:14:22,110
so we needed to be. fields think

231
00:14:22,110 --> 00:14:25,180
this is actually how it looks I guess
some of you might have seen that both

232
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:26,240
already

233
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:31,230
but a we will see their PC believe in a
few minutes

234
00:14:31,230 --> 00:14:34,810
DC sexually and work that is being
developed

235
00:14:34,810 --> 00:14:38,740
the it's a posse SM so you can see the
difference in the says when you put

236
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:40,110
everything together in a

237
00:14:40,110 --> 00:14:45,959
to layer PCB it gets way smaller

238
00:14:45,959 --> 00:14:49,770
and we will talk it in a few minutes s
about either in a few minutes as well

239
00:14:49,770 --> 00:14:53,740
air where even developing another board
that house the in system firmware update

240
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:54,950
capabilities

241
00:14:54,950 --> 00:14:58,950
so you can guess the attached the device
air tool

242
00:14:58,950 --> 00:15:03,209
whatever and forgot about it then you
have another film word 148 and you can

243
00:15:03,209 --> 00:15:06,150
upload it remotely

244
00:15:06,150 --> 00:15:09,310
I mean where you see now one-year-old
microcontroller with

245
00:15:09,310 --> 00:15:14,579
remote abate warping were so

246
00:15:14,579 --> 00:15:19,950
what does he do well it has someone
knows we will see S-twelve briefly in a

247
00:15:19,950 --> 00:15:20,400
while

248
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:25,920
so you can set up completely all the
fetus up to come bus interface

249
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:32,920
air it has memory for the options so you
don't have to set it up on every startup

250
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:39,360
well at that was obvious it can capture
and get cum bust a to

251
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:44,870
and when the bus is full at 500 kilowatt
hour but beats per second

252
00:15:44,870 --> 00:15:48,980
I mean like enter free myspace is the
minimum which is like 32 me second see

253
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:51,270
if I recall a threat

254
00:15:51,270 --> 00:15:54,990
ahead it gets ninety-two percent of the
data

255
00:15:54,990 --> 00:16:01,430
that the scene there bus with Lisa still
good

256
00:16:01,430 --> 00:16:04,500
it gone inject a ross a money pit the
frames

257
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:08,650
on real-time

258
00:16:08,650 --> 00:16:12,990
it can generate and acted by this report
which means basically doubt we can see

259
00:16:12,990 --> 00:16:13,500
some

260
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:16,850
air what I decide broadcasting not one
thank

261
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:21,029
ideas for that we use another method

262
00:16:21,029 --> 00:16:24,570
it can perform I really basic analyses
after data

263
00:16:24,570 --> 00:16:27,960
that he's been to speed on the bus like
air if they're

264
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:33,710
what's the length of the payload if its
dynamic to static

265
00:16:33,710 --> 00:16:38,330
it can store looks that lead then come
be sent to a backend for some more

266
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:39,070
advance

267
00:16:39,070 --> 00:16:44,300
analyses that Alberta will talk about in
a few minutes

268
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:48,900
yeah and with additional hi We're which
is like nothing we'll talk about it

269
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:49,380
later

270
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:52,710
you can't just up the freeway infield so
you can outs

271
00:16:52,710 --> 00:16:56,020
new stuff like at the French feel as if
you run out of space

272
00:16:56,020 --> 00:16:59,830
its really flexible

273
00:16:59,830 --> 00:17:04,400
so and the hard work itself

274
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:08,679
that its associate was just some I don't
know many pro some wireless interface

275
00:17:08,679 --> 00:17:11,959
it's up to you can use from Bluetooth
yes'm

276
00:17:11,959 --> 00:17:15,520
act deceased actually ITSM

277
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:18,520
shield so it costs the

278
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:22,409
like around 15 euros this issues for
development

279
00:17:22,409 --> 00:17:25,510
the in the end product it would be only
that white

280
00:17:25,510 --> 00:17:29,870
cheap we can see here and that cost
around 7 euros

281
00:17:29,870 --> 00:17:33,720
and then you have the same on the device
so this is still not that

282
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:36,730
chief not that's fancy it's good

283
00:17:36,730 --> 00:17:40,260
and the compass stuff MySpace or

284
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:44,770
it's free 380 30 again

285
00:17:44,770 --> 00:17:48,090
but then as we were talking about the

286
00:17:48,090 --> 00:17:51,250
become a state is not universal so if
they want to know

287
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:54,460
a howl my car works than

288
00:17:54,460 --> 00:18:00,060
how could I do that

289
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:03,740
yeah so does the Pro and I we were
speaking previously is like

290
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:07,740
okay I have my car mime a specific model
specific year

291
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:11,440
and I want on all for example what is
their bail old

292
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:15,050
that I have to San to open the door mall
some

293
00:18:15,050 --> 00:18:20,050
juicy juicy thing open to the RR
activate that I dunno up

294
00:18:20,050 --> 00:18:23,490
doings Sam cool stuff so

295
00:18:23,490 --> 00:18:26,730
what happened in my specific more than
how can I had no

296
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:30,730
what is the ID for my model my brand

297
00:18:30,730 --> 00:18:33,860
my gf car that opened the doors

298
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:38,480
how can I do it so we thought about a
statistical analysis because

299
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:42,159
break now when you do a cop touring the
cum in the combo sayre

300
00:18:42,159 --> 00:18:45,919
in the gamble slam bus and we just

301
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:50,870
receive fair dawn soap pockets with
different ID would be from payloads

302
00:18:50,870 --> 00:18:54,750
but we'll know what these babies are
doing with the know what is there

303
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:58,040
the action on that is being performed
with the Sabie

304
00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:02,409
so yeah we've be thought about okay
let's gonna do some statistical analysis

305
00:19:02,409 --> 00:19:04,070
there's nothing like a car

306
00:19:04,070 --> 00:19:07,550
the logical if a car what a card ass I
mean

307
00:19:07,550 --> 00:19:12,929
in what moment did just enough guys
wanna send the packet to open the door

308
00:19:12,929 --> 00:19:16,240
at the beginning at the AGM up the use I
think the

309
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:19,520
if your gonna opening the door gonna use
it at the beginning

310
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:23,409
of their of the trace are the top two of
course

311
00:19:23,409 --> 00:19:26,990
is not gonna be at the apt because you
are supposed to be inside the guy who

312
00:19:26,990 --> 00:19:27,399
just

313
00:19:27,399 --> 00:19:32,000
Asia if you're right in the car okay so
we thought about this kind of thing some

314
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,020
than we thought about okay so

315
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:37,530
right now what is interesting for us to
know is sadly

316
00:19:37,530 --> 00:19:40,870
what they the is performing be specific
action

317
00:19:40,870 --> 00:19:44,770
so yeah we thought we we detect about
typeof day Tom

318
00:19:44,770 --> 00:19:49,050
okay so we wanted to difference between
the typical commands like

319
00:19:49,050 --> 00:19:52,840
okay the lights are on the lights are on
the lights are on the later on I don't

320
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:53,990
care about that

321
00:19:53,990 --> 00:19:58,830
is like this statues a date that I don't
get all I want to find commands

322
00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:02,020
really actions that we can inject in the
in the box

323
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:05,080
in the network a so yeah

324
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:09,260
the thing is the their their like it or
just some random date other some tech

325
00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:10,200
Songshan

326
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:13,730
this a lot of bullshit so yeah i won

327
00:20:13,730 --> 00:20:18,120
very important thing is determine the
frequency because if I'm Sandy Lake a

328
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:20,679
pocket saying okay the lights are on the
later on

329
00:20:20,679 --> 00:20:23,820
is gonna be more or less in the same
frequency

330
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:27,190
not gonna be like open the door but ID

331
00:20:27,190 --> 00:20:30,929
that ID with the payload because I want
to remember dat

332
00:20:30,929 --> 00:20:33,950
how a compass back at the campus frame

333
00:20:33,950 --> 00:20:37,580
has they've ID and a their payload their

334
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:41,260
later okay in some some ID can be okay
the lights are on

335
00:20:41,260 --> 00:20:45,120
and the bay let them say a the light
that the song is the light squeeze in

336
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,580
the front of the car

337
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:49,659
or in the from ride the from left
wherever okay so

338
00:20:49,659 --> 00:20:52,730
in that gays we want to no the frequency

339
00:20:52,730 --> 00:20:56,580
so we can just say forget about all the
pockets of Harbin sand

340
00:20:56,580 --> 00:21:00,750
with the same frequency because the
Packers are not useful for

341
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:03,899
the things we want to do so yeah

342
00:21:03,899 --> 00:21:07,310
that's the thing the terminations a
common is on this and once

343
00:21:07,310 --> 00:21:10,380
so yeah we won this kind of things so

344
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:14,010
yep the theme about doing this that is
the dialysis

345
00:21:14,010 --> 00:21:17,580
big improving the comprehensive have
their

346
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:20,800
up there love the idea that are sent in
there in the in the network

347
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:25,640
okay that's more or less that's what
this this statistical analysis

348
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:28,890
soap yeah why we do that thus obviously
is the

349
00:21:28,890 --> 00:21:32,780
the things that they told you like we
can if we want to open the doors

350
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:36,220
we will sand that come on only once

351
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:40,610
okay we're gonna open the windows for
example we're gonna be

352
00:21:40,610 --> 00:21:43,770
and sending some specific 84 died just
for

353
00:21:43,770 --> 00:21:46,880
a specific frame of time okay just

354
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:50,370
specific a.m. time but then is gonna
stop

355
00:21:50,370 --> 00:21:55,110
so we can think how the car is well how
is the logical love the car

356
00:21:55,110 --> 00:21:59,600
the logic of the car so we can know more
or less what pockets are for

357
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:02,880
each them it action

358
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:06,730
so I year that's another thing that we
saw a lot their talks have pockets that

359
00:22:06,730 --> 00:22:07,090
are

360
00:22:07,090 --> 00:22:12,070
does the same all the time but with the
payload 0 for example

361
00:22:12,070 --> 00:22:15,290
and in some moment the but that back at
the stars beam

362
00:22:15,290 --> 00:22:19,100
exactly the same say maybe but the
payload is one

363
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:22,540
in some bite soul is like the because
the lake okay

364
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:25,710
and my lights in going I'm I'm right in
the car

365
00:22:25,710 --> 00:22:29,310
my lighter of but this is getting dark
so I'm gonna

366
00:22:29,310 --> 00:22:32,730
turn on the lights and we said this

367
00:22:32,730 --> 00:22:36,760
meanwhile differences like the co2 on
but the ID the same

368
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:40,000
okay I want to be clear and i'd like we
have the idea of the back at them then

369
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,590
we have the payload

370
00:22:41,590 --> 00:22:45,960
so it does to me that the ideas turn on
and turn off the lights

371
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:51,310
it's different become be the same idea
but with different pale okay

372
00:22:51,310 --> 00:22:55,520
and yeah that's another option at this
very useful my dinner the car is turned

373
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:57,260
off so the compasses

374
00:22:57,260 --> 00:23:02,130
not there send in any tight any data so
that we can do is just there

375
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:06,649
the senate connect our device to their
to their combos

376
00:23:06,649 --> 00:23:10,560
network and this send sentence send some

377
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:13,740
stupid packet to their to the network

378
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:17,280
they see you have an average receive the
packet and I'm gonna an honest are

379
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:18,250
standing

380
00:23:18,250 --> 00:23:21,880
some stupid comments like both get
what's happening here with this happen

381
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:22,490
here

382
00:23:22,490 --> 00:23:26,340
so we can just get a lot all they say
the same thing okay

383
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:29,419
I don't care about these ideas in the
real capture

384
00:23:29,419 --> 00:23:34,409
but I say okay they're not gonna taking
care about those babies because I D self

385
00:23:34,409 --> 00:23:39,470
start to say these form from there the
seals

386
00:23:39,470 --> 00:23:44,330
so with the dow okay do you know they
are doing other where you seem hafer

387
00:23:44,330 --> 00:23:48,790
to kill a bite around does Lake get

388
00:23:48,790 --> 00:23:52,030
this thing okay

389
00:23:52,030 --> 00:23:55,030
it's very cheap that's why you see them
actually

390
00:23:55,030 --> 00:24:00,090
we use it to for talented be in bill up
in C Cody been assembly goats eventually

391
00:24:00,090 --> 00:24:01,919
because we would have been up

392
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:05,950
RAM memory to recollect all the friends
that we are receiving so

393
00:24:05,950 --> 00:24:09,169
it's kind of cool this to having to deal
with this

394
00:24:09,169 --> 00:24:12,320
limitations this limits so

395
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:17,250
yeah weep created a website for doing
the analysis itself was impossible to do

396
00:24:17,250 --> 00:24:17,890
it in

397
00:24:17,890 --> 00:24:21,030
basting so yeah I

398
00:24:21,030 --> 00:24:25,080
it's just so EC website the youth Halo
game

399
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:28,059
you can't do can you see it I mean why
when I we're gonna pull this they're

400
00:24:28,059 --> 00:24:29,780
they're the web said with their

401
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:34,070
gold and the Golden Bear basically that
the bass is like analysis

402
00:24:34,070 --> 00:24:37,940
analysis there today I am today to

403
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:41,770
this is our degree analysis that we have
already we have four different alice is

404
00:24:41,770 --> 00:24:43,280
one of them is just the least

405
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:47,830
the most-used ID if I maybe he is used

406
00:24:47,830 --> 00:24:51,590
so many times it must be probably

407
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:55,950
I stupid a be a menace to be there I ID
that they don't care

408
00:24:55,950 --> 00:24:59,230
an 80% of the state to established or
something like that okay

409
00:24:59,230 --> 00:25:02,710
that the %uh the what the %uh there the
other analysis that we with the

410
00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:06,250
is this the Brea New York DC of the
activate the

411
00:25:06,250 --> 00:25:10,170
is if I these be in San all the time the
same frequency

412
00:25:10,170 --> 00:25:14,950
I don't care about that we're gonna look
for commands actual command to the car

413
00:25:14,950 --> 00:25:15,220
like

414
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:20,080
open door turn off the lights or
whatever things that can be

415
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:25,059
interesting and yet at the same theme
pack it's an affair time-line

416
00:25:25,059 --> 00:25:30,580
on that is very important possible match
with some commands

417
00:25:30,580 --> 00:25:33,730
and not only that there are some pockets

418
00:25:33,730 --> 00:25:36,950
I mean some frames that the ID is the
same but

419
00:25:36,950 --> 00:25:41,880
the payload it's something from and tell
by it happening for mental backed

420
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:44,960
so it's like ABC the he

421
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:48,260
whatever okay its the is like that all
the time

422
00:25:48,260 --> 00:25:51,760
I don't care about those packets

423
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:55,299
I'm not gonna be. wasting my time take
him

424
00:25:55,299 --> 00:25:59,049
air I mean trying to understand what
that back it's going to do because

425
00:25:59,049 --> 00:26:02,340
most of the times that back it is not
that lovely

426
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:05,660
command that we're looking for

427
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:09,470
Saudia this gonna do them I a half

428
00:26:09,470 --> 00:26:12,510
I hope to have internet here yeah

429
00:26:12,510 --> 00:26:16,110
would have actually we

430
00:26:16,110 --> 00:26:19,710
that's awful the connected to a to %ah
metal and Edler

431
00:26:19,710 --> 00:26:23,470
wifi who was unprotected and is called
the had ACR sitcom

432
00:26:23,470 --> 00:26:26,750
place be nice

433
00:26:26,750 --> 00:26:30,179
now and that's okay

434
00:26:30,179 --> 00:26:34,610
I know this is not they've gone bad I
the militants who that is

435
00:26:34,610 --> 00:26:38,130
and trust you I'll okay

436
00:26:38,130 --> 00:26:45,130
so wolf that's horrible

437
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:53,800
okay so us about the was sane a

438
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:57,610
usually when you see an ID that the spin
sent like overall

439
00:26:57,610 --> 00:27:01,780
there many times the it's not
interesting

440
00:27:01,780 --> 00:27:05,210
but still issued look at the paid off
because

441
00:27:05,210 --> 00:27:10,710
a it might be the case that I need the
spin is for common some for status

442
00:27:10,710 --> 00:27:11,490
report

443
00:27:11,490 --> 00:27:15,410
which would mean if you do in a
statistical analysis of the whole day to

444
00:27:15,410 --> 00:27:18,750
on let's say he miss gebbie like simple

445
00:27:18,750 --> 00:27:21,790
at there's just one comment

446
00:27:21,790 --> 00:27:24,950
payload and then there are some the
fixed

447
00:27:24,950 --> 00:27:29,660
payload that will send some that to stay
to the north

448
00:27:29,660 --> 00:27:34,700
let's call it like a so if you gonna
statistical analysis to the whole peel

449
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:40,730
off the top in broadcast that at the end
you will see that 99.999 percent

450
00:27:40,730 --> 00:27:44,520
is this a static data but this one he
knoweth that will be different

451
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:51,520
that will probably be a comment a hold
on we're having trouble with my for

452
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:14,820
here yeah we better do that

453
00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:24,420
he picked you

454
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:29,060
let's see if it works

455
00:28:29,060 --> 00:28:33,710
a home the

456
00:28:33,710 --> 00:28:37,260
why you do this yeah but what about how

457
00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:43,600
as well yeah there's like

458
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:47,670
is very yes very simple website again
this uploader it can traffic Nadu can

459
00:28:47,670 --> 00:28:48,860
capture with this software

460
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:52,780
I mean with this high were and they have
I double up some

461
00:28:52,780 --> 00:28:56,260
by fun this and code and is gonna do
that I am

462
00:28:56,260 --> 00:28:59,750
analysis itself I really half

463
00:28:59,750 --> 00:29:06,750
says awful and you

464
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:22,820
okay yeah I have already uploaded this

465
00:29:22,820 --> 00:29:26,390
okay I can try to blow their this can I
mean there

466
00:29:26,390 --> 00:29:29,659
the love that I have but I don't carry
the same

467
00:29:29,659 --> 00:29:33,280
so that we can see here we have their
the Sabie

468
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:36,620
have been Sand Lake three thousand times

469
00:29:36,620 --> 00:29:40,640
the ID 237 we have all day these

470
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:43,870
okay your okay

471
00:29:43,870 --> 00:29:47,030
I here we have the same tear mudane
terrible average

472
00:29:47,030 --> 00:29:50,750
okay so this lady has been sanded 72
milliseconds

473
00:29:50,750 --> 00:29:53,799
so I don't care about the Sabie maybe I
get about

474
00:29:53,799 --> 00:29:58,750
the ID's that at at the bottom loop

475
00:29:58,750 --> 00:30:04,150
here okay maybe those ideas are more
interesting maybe those ABS

476
00:30:04,150 --> 00:30:10,590
are commands yeah yeah I know the Duke a
maybe not see very well

477
00:30:10,590 --> 00:30:14,890
I love callers in this thing's and then
here you have their percent 8

478
00:30:14,890 --> 00:30:18,090
up the total with the same day ID's

479
00:30:18,090 --> 00:30:21,549
here to concede actually very easley

480
00:30:21,549 --> 00:30:26,039
these ID 401 be has been sent a lot of
time

481
00:30:26,039 --> 00:30:29,490
and actual according to our test

482
00:30:29,490 --> 00:30:33,490
it happen eaton has a counter an
incremental bite

483
00:30:33,490 --> 00:30:37,809
so do can see do can see it here

484
00:30:37,809 --> 00:30:41,130
in the bite three there is an
incremental counter

485
00:30:41,130 --> 00:30:44,429
so brawley this is not important for us

486
00:30:44,429 --> 00:30:48,070
actually do in the stairs we free
finally

487
00:30:48,070 --> 00:30:51,929
got day the packet was saying chair to
Pho been in there

488
00:30:51,929 --> 00:30:55,820
the dollar soul the door the car so
that's that's nice

489
00:30:55,820 --> 00:30:59,030
Soulier go for it no

490
00:30:59,030 --> 00:31:02,270
needs

491
00:31:02,270 --> 00:31:09,270
moved on okay so

492
00:31:10,230 --> 00:31:13,820
the basically we know that injection is
possible

493
00:31:13,820 --> 00:31:16,919
that is nothing new we can dog their
data

494
00:31:16,919 --> 00:31:20,760
is nothing new so let's talk about
attacks

495
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:24,169
actually a own cum bus soul

496
00:31:24,169 --> 00:31:27,890
why use in attacks like a better was
seen

497
00:31:27,890 --> 00:31:31,169
air some frames have been sent
periodically thats neck see

498
00:31:31,169 --> 00:31:35,070
missus that the this get the stick to
their nights

499
00:31:35,070 --> 00:31:38,880
will say we want to turn off the lights
but it comes out that lights

500
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:43,860
are being the the night the status what
they should be is being both tested like

501
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:48,280
every 10 minutes seconds so if I keep on
injecting the

502
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:51,770
lights off they I'm gonna have some
crazy stuff like

503
00:31:51,770 --> 00:31:55,350
light are gonna be tight turning on of
on off because i insane like

504
00:31:55,350 --> 00:31:59,620
turn off at and this is the same turn on
so after all

505
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:03,809
it's either not gonna work at all or
south is gonna smell like fried

506
00:32:03,809 --> 00:32:07,080
like many small you know a few make
things quite pricey

507
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:12,899
so injection is not like yeah I solely
see company so suggesting Dec date on

508
00:32:12,899 --> 00:32:14,370
everything we are so wonderful

509
00:32:14,370 --> 00:32:17,700
it's not like that sucky and then

510
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:21,130
the is a some models

511
00:32:21,130 --> 00:32:25,590
require some conditions as well back
let's say if you want to

512
00:32:25,590 --> 00:32:29,559
use the parking brake then the speech
should never be higher than cereal

513
00:32:29,559 --> 00:32:33,330
because you know you cannot use their
parking right to 100 kilometers per hour

514
00:32:33,330 --> 00:32:36,750
so then what happens if you want to use
it

515
00:32:36,750 --> 00:32:40,399
it doesn't work okay yes sure I can
inject their turn on the parking brake

516
00:32:40,399 --> 00:32:41,890
but it's not gonna happen

517
00:32:41,890 --> 00:32:46,220
so still injection is not just like that
the Cy Young gets tough

518
00:32:46,220 --> 00:32:50,020
so let's say I D takeover

519
00:32:50,020 --> 00:32:54,149
as we were talking earlier

520
00:32:54,149 --> 00:32:57,270
we want to do something

521
00:32:57,270 --> 00:33:00,549
about that about there not being able to
the subsalt

522
00:33:00,549 --> 00:33:04,039
air we developed an attack that is

523
00:33:04,039 --> 00:33:09,030
a basically is taking down frames with
us that done the frames we want and then

524
00:33:09,030 --> 00:33:10,039
we get their own

525
00:33:10,039 --> 00:33:13,039
so %uh and we do it in a way that

526
00:33:13,039 --> 00:33:16,419
the it's not gone see there are like a I
real

527
00:33:16,419 --> 00:33:19,630
where r it's just like something we're
we will see it in a while

528
00:33:19,630 --> 00:33:23,789
so basically what the hell does it work
with and i thought i gather the one to

529
00:33:23,789 --> 00:33:24,429
replace

530
00:33:24,429 --> 00:33:27,580
we use the the CHT wet ash its

531
00:33:27,580 --> 00:33:33,030
a its four wire cs2 for the commerce and
24 feet we use a battery then it's just

532
00:33:33,030 --> 00:33:34,040
two wires

533
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:39,500
but since it should be the possible to
have it for long term in the car

534
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:43,740
we are using for wires so

535
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:47,080
the then was the IDAS first meeting

536
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:47,890
the

537
00:33:47,890 --> 00:33:51,450
we will basically the the real time read
the

538
00:33:51,450 --> 00:33:55,310
beats of the ID once we see

539
00:33:55,310 --> 00:33:58,490
there's so much been wheeling get
willing debt than ever

540
00:33:58,490 --> 00:34:01,800
so we will put down the frame and then
we will

541
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:05,280
injector on frame and it do not

542
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:09,780
there somewhere or Cecchin possibilities
according to the con

543
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:14,320
a specific asians they're not just in it
you will see it

544
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:17,340
that DS keeps forever trying to transmit

545
00:34:17,340 --> 00:34:20,570
Anna so well

546
00:34:20,570 --> 00:34:23,750
that's basically it why does it work

547
00:34:23,750 --> 00:34:28,169
lead you to the arbitration that issue
song come bus

548
00:34:28,169 --> 00:34:31,690
it it's always possible the

549
00:34:31,690 --> 00:34:35,950
to put the the bus in Oslo state which
is dominants

550
00:34:35,950 --> 00:34:41,010
since that's how obliteration walks like
many mothers are trying to

551
00:34:41,010 --> 00:34:44,580
fight to get there ID he's ID then

552
00:34:44,580 --> 00:34:48,370
if another model has a hot low were ID
which means

553
00:34:48,370 --> 00:34:51,470
the a its dominance a

554
00:34:51,470 --> 00:34:54,580
be twice and then it there

555
00:34:54,580 --> 00:34:58,640
other one if it's trying to set level
high but 8 3/8 out there police though

556
00:34:58,640 --> 00:34:59,680
it will stop

557
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:03,720
so basically at their point about this
is you can set the bus lo

558
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:08,270
anytime and as well

559
00:35:08,270 --> 00:35:12,000
yeah that just put it this is a swell by
specific ation

560
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:16,340
for seeing that this been booked us that
let what not but got the sense

561
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:20,120
first thing in the frame in a compass
frame is this target so

562
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:23,200
when the bus is like silent and I see
it's going a low

563
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:27,210
I know something's gonna happen and then
the bus the second thing

564
00:35:27,210 --> 00:35:30,930
the ID so I can just before anything
happens

565
00:35:30,930 --> 00:35:34,070
I know they the before even 90 West the
length of the field

566
00:35:34,070 --> 00:35:37,160
with you know they the so I don't need
to wait

567
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:41,940
much more okay I get day the a check it
then

568
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:46,890
what's an error with said that we can
put their bus in a lower state

569
00:35:46,890 --> 00:35:50,330
dominant anytime and how big a signal
either or

570
00:35:50,330 --> 00:35:53,670
by putting doubt the bus for air 12

571
00:35:53,670 --> 00:35:57,670
be times so I can get there are anytime

572
00:35:57,670 --> 00:36:00,880
as it doesn't matter I can always put it
down

573
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:05,440
and as well

574
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:08,780
ever worse the actually this

575
00:36:08,780 --> 00:36:12,430
the they can be reported by The All
model on real time

576
00:36:12,430 --> 00:36:15,940
SE's the models are a a cold

577
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:20,840
echoing themselves to check if the data
they are trying to pull out is actually

578
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:22,270
making it out to the bus

579
00:36:22,270 --> 00:36:25,940
so if they see that they thought they
are trying to pull out is not making it

580
00:36:25,940 --> 00:36:27,180
to the past they will yes

581
00:36:27,180 --> 00:36:31,030
signal this ever stuff that we can see
in this image the

582
00:36:31,030 --> 00:36:34,890
on the con- rx this is like let's say 1
moderates within from the bus unpack it

583
00:36:34,890 --> 00:36:35,940
when it's just meet in

584
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:39,730
it will see it so Nicole so it is the

585
00:36:39,730 --> 00:36:44,030
it is the one that shooting get the Evo
now

586
00:36:44,030 --> 00:36:47,900
the where you seen the microchip

587
00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:51,290
a and the NCB 2550 air 15

588
00:36:51,290 --> 00:36:55,710
yep air which has a possibility to
signal the start the frame

589
00:36:55,710 --> 00:36:59,350
the so it makes it quite DC

590
00:36:59,350 --> 00:37:02,730
it to know when to frame it is starting
but actually

591
00:37:02,730 --> 00:37:06,710
is due to the fact that its sick now
it's just the same

592
00:37:06,710 --> 00:37:09,840
sixty 2.5 air nanoseconds

593
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:14,310
we had to the plot something that was
even better

594
00:37:14,310 --> 00:37:17,610
we no longer required a so

595
00:37:17,610 --> 00:37:22,260
now we're gonna see a demo K

596
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:28,110
so OK from our so basically

597
00:37:28,110 --> 00:37:31,240
this is the car ECU

598
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:34,330
this is the subject third we're going to
use with the demo

599
00:37:34,330 --> 00:37:38,320
logic and I so we're gonna be you seem
to see all the stuff

600
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:42,200
one thing we we could and we try to
bring here a car but

601
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:46,710
it was not possible gay was sorry about
others was the only thing that we can do

602
00:37:46,710 --> 00:37:50,590
is like bringing a ECU but we can of
course at that

603
00:37:50,590 --> 00:37:54,310
today combos with this device is the
same is this to

604
00:37:54,310 --> 00:37:59,700
to watch that's all pic

605
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:03,610
well without one ECU well you know has a
few more

606
00:38:03,610 --> 00:38:07,030
so and actually this

607
00:38:07,030 --> 00:38:10,600
a small device is the something we

608
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:16,330
made for a serial link i'm for updating
the firmware remote the

609
00:38:16,330 --> 00:38:20,370
that's it what we were talking about
earlier this is a Bluetooth mobile this

610
00:38:20,370 --> 00:38:22,680
is an SD card use as buffer

611
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:26,830
and their fancy red light is that we
know your

612
00:38:26,830 --> 00:38:30,200
that we can see your hand there so and
then

613
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:33,450
these here I'm not gonna move it I will
take everything apart

614
00:38:33,450 --> 00:38:36,530
and we will see it when they're the most
don't this is the CHT

615
00:38:36,530 --> 00:38:40,040
that he sexually yes a touch by come bus
with these two wires

616
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:44,960
the today see you and their power supply
which at the other two wires

617
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:51,000
so the this get back to the computer

618
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:58,000
hate computer police

619
00:39:00,349 --> 00:39:03,390
okay so Asus said this iz serio

620
00:39:03,390 --> 00:39:08,790
so we're gonna sub-zero termino its

621
00:39:08,790 --> 00:39:12,810
here radio K so

622
00:39:12,810 --> 00:39:16,270
were gonna to connect to it this is
Bluetooth actually

623
00:39:16,270 --> 00:39:20,859
and and and and and okay let's reset
this

624
00:39:20,859 --> 00:39:27,859
and now okay we're gonna use a

625
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:33,089
the sewer show we're gonna reset this

626
00:39:33,089 --> 00:39:36,560
okay soul

627
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:40,410
mislead out this their interface for the
CHD

628
00:39:40,410 --> 00:39:44,450
let's check how the bus looks like
before doing anything

629
00:39:44,450 --> 00:39:48,960
so

630
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:55,960
one second

631
00:39:56,510 --> 00:40:00,110
yeah we can actually see that frame
turbine cents

632
00:40:00,110 --> 00:40:04,200
a Nikki Anderson

633
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:07,950
are some friends have been sent there
with so my piece

634
00:40:07,950 --> 00:40:11,320
so I mean at best traffic right yeah

635
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:14,330
so let's say you okay we like

636
00:40:14,330 --> 00:40:18,960
ID 288 for a sample okay so

637
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:22,630
yeah so juicy it's actually yester yet

638
00:40:22,630 --> 00:40:26,410
do concedes clearly I guess the 288 your

639
00:40:26,410 --> 00:40:30,270
so yeah and you can see how the data
looks like yeah I we can see some

640
00:40:30,270 --> 00:40:32,420
friends he looks so nice so

641
00:40:32,420 --> 00:40:37,180
as he met week your let's go for it so

642
00:40:37,180 --> 00:40:44,180
let's configure this

643
00:40:50,370 --> 00:40:56,290
okay so we said 288 and this in dept for
some belong one

644
00:40:56,290 --> 00:41:03,290
22 33 okay so let's see what's going on

645
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:14,579
lips now doesn't look so symmetric ok
but what's this

646
00:41:14,579 --> 00:41:18,199
K so

647
00:41:18,199 --> 00:41:21,400
actually if you see Anna

648
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:25,589
yet this is tough tone here okay the
white one

649
00:41:25,589 --> 00:41:30,130
this one is indicates that we have the
tape that the start the frame

650
00:41:30,130 --> 00:41:33,150
which would be these and then it's a
small one

651
00:41:33,150 --> 00:41:36,689
missed a beat count in so actually a

652
00:41:36,689 --> 00:41:40,369
if this does move anymore we can see
we're counting the beaten me though

653
00:41:40,369 --> 00:41:44,229
so if we get so much when get the narrow

654
00:41:44,229 --> 00:41:48,880
so it doesn't make it we're just getting
our horse

655
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:52,809
your

656
00:41:52,809 --> 00:41:56,089
so your and a

657
00:41:56,089 --> 00:41:59,259
when we are going to inject our own the
stuff you know it

658
00:41:59,259 --> 00:42:02,839
since this is buffered the the cum bus
stop

659
00:42:02,839 --> 00:42:05,900
if we were like sending out there frame

660
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:10,329
and it got Baffert then we found out
that we would put down our own pocket so

661
00:42:10,329 --> 00:42:13,890
we have to be seen as well on the our
own TX line

662
00:42:13,890 --> 00:42:15,460
for the

663
00:42:15,460 --> 00:42:19,230
for the cumbersome when we detect that
that that level was low both on TX are

664
00:42:19,230 --> 00:42:20,500
not on rx

665
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:24,290
it will be us trying to send the packet
so that's why here

666
00:42:24,290 --> 00:42:27,450
we can only see one despite we have that
that that

667
00:42:27,450 --> 00:42:30,460
its us they're trying to send the packet
so we stopped

668
00:42:30,460 --> 00:42:34,640
but actually they see you was trying to
send as well at the same time so we got

669
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:35,380
an error

670
00:42:35,380 --> 00:42:39,430
and let them we need

671
00:42:39,430 --> 00:42:42,480
a little bit more debugging but doug
LaMalfa

672
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:45,620
through and is worse us

673
00:42:45,620 --> 00:42:49,620
here with our own piano yeah

674
00:42:49,620 --> 00:42:53,040
and you can see that when it's another
ID

675
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:58,110
its justice keep like we check it's
different

676
00:42:58,110 --> 00:43:02,260
we don't put it down so basically
everything we detect the other one

677
00:43:02,260 --> 00:43:06,830
we just put it down your

678
00:43:06,830 --> 00:43:13,830
like not suffer

679
00:43:15,820 --> 00:43:19,770
yeah there are other options do you can
see in the interface Lake NJ

680
00:43:19,770 --> 00:43:24,200
a specific command okay we can just a
coward II specific AB and then we can

681
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:25,400
inject our own ID

682
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:28,800
so we can just generate that the flights

683
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:32,750
that mean the lights get Gracie or
something like that million that you are

684
00:43:32,750 --> 00:43:37,450
but at this other configuration options
we were talking about earlier

685
00:43:37,450 --> 00:43:42,310
like you know at the some stuff but it's
just a basic stuff for the combat into

686
00:43:42,310 --> 00:43:42,820
things

687
00:43:42,820 --> 00:43:46,220
yeah definitely dugan do as much as you
want

688
00:43:46,220 --> 00:43:50,640
during my donation is your limit here
and of course is very very important day

689
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:54,800
and i am. the statistic analysis very
important because we need to know what

690
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:56,510
they do he is doing a specific task

691
00:43:56,510 --> 00:44:01,020
with a know that but i just do our data
service to a specific ID that

692
00:44:01,020 --> 00:44:04,350
we don't know what this doing come here
on

693
00:44:04,350 --> 00:44:09,120
okay so tends to and

694
00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:12,430
well actually let you know we just saw a
small part

695
00:44:12,430 --> 00:44:16,370
but where we did the logic after a while
this was work in

696
00:44:16,370 --> 00:44:20,340
and if you noticed it was a stillbirth
Gustin

697
00:44:20,340 --> 00:44:24,120
on the network I mean when it the techs
a up to 25

698
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:29,170
forever first it shoot stop by the does
not stop it just keeps unrestrained

699
00:44:29,170 --> 00:44:32,840
forever so you can just keep on getting
input in dumb friends wherever

700
00:44:32,840 --> 00:44:36,270
we should not be possible and now

701
00:44:36,270 --> 00:44:40,600
a about FlexRay well that's the few
third that's a real peter north cum bust

702
00:44:40,600 --> 00:44:45,350
that is a written protocol it supports
up to 10 ml bits per second and

703
00:44:45,350 --> 00:44:49,720
led the working principle is basically
the same ass cum bus arbitration

704
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:53,370
yeah I decide the beginning as well so

705
00:44:53,370 --> 00:44:58,320
cases yes there

706
00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:02,090
I'll list speak a little bit about four
and six

707
00:45:02,090 --> 00:45:05,130
how it can I retrieve the information of
a car

708
00:45:05,130 --> 00:45:08,370
of a crass in a car a fire accident

709
00:45:08,370 --> 00:45:12,060
okay so every car have a black box right
now

710
00:45:12,060 --> 00:45:15,980
nowadays all the car so far meanie black
box with information all this

711
00:45:15,980 --> 00:45:17,330
information on that we are

712
00:45:17,330 --> 00:45:21,730
speaking about weekend the star a part
of this information in the bin this

713
00:45:21,730 --> 00:45:22,610
black box

714
00:45:22,610 --> 00:45:25,660
this information is usually the story
and a

715
00:45:25,660 --> 00:45:30,830
a back ECU okay so we can just try to
retrieve this information that we can

716
00:45:30,830 --> 00:45:32,780
use that information in court

717
00:45:32,780 --> 00:45:37,190
we can use this information just I don't
know this to take with them by

718
00:45:37,190 --> 00:45:40,810
run them is he a back issue some know
what happened in the crass

719
00:45:40,810 --> 00:45:46,060
a bad guy okay so yeah like I told you
say

720
00:45:46,060 --> 00:45:49,360
is in there but you see you on usually
it is the story in the prone

721
00:45:49,360 --> 00:45:54,590
okay so yeah I understand there's some
software in some hardware that can

722
00:45:54,590 --> 00:45:57,060
retrieve this information but usually
it's a

723
00:45:57,060 --> 00:46:00,460
is not free actually is never free

724
00:46:00,460 --> 00:46:03,550
and soul for

725
00:46:03,550 --> 00:46:07,750
be in DC the in this specific ECU it's
the brownies Bosh

726
00:46:07,750 --> 00:46:11,380
okay the brand of the CU's breeze blows
and the

727
00:46:11,380 --> 00:46:15,400
boss tougher tool who who is called yet
have a tool that

728
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:18,880
retrieves the information from our from
ACU

729
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:21,950
we can now Richard that information in
three different ways

730
00:46:21,950 --> 00:46:26,030
okay disconnect in and it today RDP port

731
00:46:26,030 --> 00:46:30,700
okay and we need authentication we can
connect with the air but model directly

732
00:46:30,700 --> 00:46:33,170
and so is how can they see you on
connect directly

733
00:46:33,170 --> 00:46:37,520
to the issue like Greg we are connecting
right now and the other Mar

734
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:40,650
D people to wait is

735
00:46:40,650 --> 00:46:44,960
really endeared these using their prom
read in their prime directly dump

736
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:47,470
information on their prime try to parse
that information

737
00:46:47,470 --> 00:46:51,450
the pro now that is that I mean that
good thing about that is that we don't

738
00:46:51,450 --> 00:46:51,800
need

739
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:55,340
authentication so that's cool with a
need to just

740
00:46:55,340 --> 00:46:59,620
though the cdkey that he do so the needs
to be performed if you want to connect

741
00:46:59,620 --> 00:47:00,950
through the RDP port

742
00:47:00,950 --> 00:47:05,850
or producing directly there but model so
you're the only people are is one of the

743
00:47:05,850 --> 00:47:07,620
options connecting directly to their

744
00:47:07,620 --> 00:47:10,950
and ECU is the other option to access to
the data

745
00:47:10,950 --> 00:47:14,820
who is in the from and the other option
is OK I have the paper also

746
00:47:14,820 --> 00:47:19,210
was gonna dump everything so this is a
sober I told you about

747
00:47:19,210 --> 00:47:23,720
software hardware so it calls like nine
thou Sun

748
00:47:23,720 --> 00:47:27,370
so yeah we're like a student's with a
higher for

749
00:47:27,370 --> 00:47:30,900
this kind of money so actually

750
00:47:30,900 --> 00:47:34,340
we don't know that their mom them the
sober do remember yeah

751
00:47:34,340 --> 00:47:37,560
we don't know the software you go to the
other machine

752
00:47:37,560 --> 00:47:40,920
the sauna so everybody the software so
they come by

753
00:47:40,920 --> 00:47:45,160
boss products yeah

754
00:47:45,160 --> 00:47:48,920
does the software

755
00:47:48,920 --> 00:47:55,790
okay yeah led me yeah the ballz grass
data retrieval tools so the things that

756
00:47:55,790 --> 00:48:00,040
it requires an activation so I just took
a look

757
00:48:00,040 --> 00:48:03,720
okay and I saw this waiting for a file
with respect to

758
00:48:03,720 --> 00:48:06,950
extension CDF now the so funny

759
00:48:06,950 --> 00:48:11,880
CDF after the flag yeah I was tryin I
just generated a random manner

760
00:48:11,880 --> 00:48:15,220
Randolph I'll in that case this is a
runoff I'll

761
00:48:15,220 --> 00:48:20,620
an open it and I don't know why the puck
was executed

762
00:48:20,620 --> 00:48:23,780
I don't have any idea about why did this
happen

763
00:48:23,780 --> 00:48:27,650
I'm so confused soul we were not able to
use their

764
00:48:27,650 --> 00:48:31,280
this this summer this is the last
version of that the solar okay

765
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:35,050
so we are not able to use that so where
ru so we tried

766
00:48:35,050 --> 00:48:42,050
other things what

767
00:48:46,550 --> 00:48:51,790
yes okay so yeah what about poor guy so
guys that doesn't know how to activate

768
00:48:51,790 --> 00:48:52,840
the software

769
00:48:52,840 --> 00:48:57,400
make me don't know so %um

770
00:48:57,400 --> 00:49:02,530
okay makes so yeah there's a list of
supported bagels

771
00:49:02,530 --> 00:49:07,510
so air in our case Aklan contacted with
us

772
00:49:07,510 --> 00:49:12,550
a customer and some Mercedes Mercedes
was not in the supported by a call so we

773
00:49:12,550 --> 00:49:14,720
were not able to use this tool

774
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:17,980
to strike the information to parse the
information into

775
00:49:17,980 --> 00:49:21,520
give the client or the customer um

776
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:27,120
I report okay so what year that was
later phase what are we going to do

777
00:49:27,120 --> 00:49:31,120
in that case so what with the this diary
dear these

778
00:49:31,120 --> 00:49:34,750
aired the update from okay do you can
see the prong

779
00:49:34,750 --> 00:49:38,420
down here this this a small

780
00:49:38,420 --> 00:49:42,870
cheap okay so we Dom there they perform

781
00:49:42,870 --> 00:49:48,410
and we had information that is just a by
now we do know how to parse this

782
00:49:48,410 --> 00:49:49,990
information with an OK

783
00:49:49,990 --> 00:49:53,090
the first three bites are gonna be there
speed up the car

784
00:49:53,090 --> 00:49:57,630
once a calm before the crass and the
next three bites are gonna be the speed

785
00:49:57,630 --> 00:50:01,580
two seconds before the crash and the so
they're part of the file is there

786
00:50:01,580 --> 00:50:05,660
rpm at the moment the grass we didn't
know that so that we'd be this

787
00:50:05,660 --> 00:50:08,710
to reset this this a.m.

788
00:50:08,710 --> 00:50:12,310
this file this Dom we reset it to the
default

789
00:50:12,310 --> 00:50:15,550
and moment and we did a beef

790
00:50:15,550 --> 00:50:20,690
so in that case we could know what out
the exact parts of the fire the have

791
00:50:20,690 --> 00:50:22,500
that were being modified

792
00:50:22,500 --> 00:50:25,840
okay so we know that but the specific
parts contains

793
00:50:25,840 --> 00:50:29,140
information relevant information for us

794
00:50:29,140 --> 00:50:33,670
okay so yeah we knew that some parts
were to change

795
00:50:33,670 --> 00:50:38,580
sold in a nexus there but we did this is
to use this program we know well as

796
00:50:38,580 --> 00:50:42,320
is labor on that do come this tried to
premium

797
00:50:42,320 --> 00:50:46,090
some graphics of their of data

798
00:50:46,090 --> 00:50:49,810
so we retrieve some am functions

799
00:50:49,810 --> 00:50:54,310
okay so we if use that I across this
gonna be up

800
00:50:54,310 --> 00:50:57,760
really putes break the guys gonna

801
00:50:57,760 --> 00:51:02,230
asthma stop mentally so if we have we
had some

802
00:51:02,230 --> 00:51:05,740
graphics were act a stand mount I'm
other one

803
00:51:05,740 --> 00:51:09,810
what the sand and so in that case if you
use a crescent we only

804
00:51:09,810 --> 00:51:12,900
cares about the descendant and graphics
for

805
00:51:12,900 --> 00:51:16,200
for the speed I mean this btw

806
00:51:16,200 --> 00:51:19,640
if I go to serial with 38

807
00:51:19,640 --> 00:51:23,800
I'm week gotten here

808
00:51:23,800 --> 00:51:28,190
it totally looks he was the only and
this NDMA

809
00:51:28,190 --> 00:51:31,350
graphic that we had so after def

810
00:51:31,350 --> 00:51:35,359
of course so yeah we realize that that
was the specific

811
00:51:35,359 --> 00:51:38,550
dispute doing the accident so yeah

812
00:51:38,550 --> 00:51:41,630
was 9 cool how to

813
00:51:41,630 --> 00:51:45,920
be able to even not having the way

814
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:49,060
in which the there the information is
sparsely

815
00:51:49,060 --> 00:51:52,820
who do something to figure out

816
00:51:52,820 --> 00:51:56,220
soap okay so

817
00:51:56,220 --> 00:52:01,040
the about the the Seattle

818
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:06,010
okay air will be sown with a senior an
era be shown off to how we're

819
00:52:06,010 --> 00:52:10,680
an annual revision of the soap were this
one already ha sets

820
00:52:10,680 --> 00:52:14,210
it has come bus so it's going to be
working with cum bus

821
00:52:14,210 --> 00:52:18,820
with Cade I'm and should be working with
Lena swell

822
00:52:18,820 --> 00:52:22,620
the we hot or a the

823
00:52:22,620 --> 00:52:26,100
dawn the implementation for come bus for
this is 16

824
00:52:26,100 --> 00:52:30,030
on this one we will

825
00:52:30,030 --> 00:52:34,540
released other swell area a subletter
said we are working on their quest a to

826
00:52:34,540 --> 00:52:36,140
retrieve a lost soul

827
00:52:36,140 --> 00:52:42,510
air ducts are still in the works a.m. we
should be able in a near future to

828
00:52:42,510 --> 00:52:46,420
gets their crash data for not cause use
in the ECU tool

829
00:52:46,420 --> 00:52:52,880
and then parks it's yeah I didn't say
that but we are working about doing DS

830
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:56,530
a partial information on in our
automated way

831
00:52:56,530 --> 00:52:59,650
but the thing is that with a half all

832
00:52:59,650 --> 00:53:04,200
that D for an a about EC used to be able
to know how

833
00:53:04,200 --> 00:53:07,780
that the information is a store how to
parties information we need

834
00:53:07,780 --> 00:53:11,700
it's a very manly job an all-gay I have
this tampa

835
00:53:11,700 --> 00:53:15,510
this a specific ECU this a specific
model okay let's see how the information

836
00:53:15,510 --> 00:53:16,060
on

837
00:53:16,060 --> 00:53:19,690
is a star in a perm so if you have some

838
00:53:19,690 --> 00:53:23,490
a rocky see you some dude unwanted even
if you have a car right now you want to

839
00:53:23,490 --> 00:53:25,770
just a cow they see you and give it to
me it's okay

840
00:53:25,770 --> 00:53:29,120
so %uh

841
00:53:29,120 --> 00:53:33,040
that

842
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:37,760
so okay I'll finish the we're gonna have
this %eh DNA shown

843
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:42,220
with basic functionality not the bleach
itself but should anyone's

844
00:53:42,220 --> 00:53:46,330
want to see it to get the cold for it
the

845
00:53:46,330 --> 00:53:50,680
we would send its and the option I'll
with the air film were

846
00:53:50,680 --> 00:53:54,560
the so everything all the updates

847
00:53:54,560 --> 00:53:58,580
the high were of course the should be
around 10 Dollaz

848
00:53:58,580 --> 00:54:01,880
and a everything can be downloaded phone
are

849
00:54:01,880 --> 00:54:05,290
it up where we possibly so

850
00:54:05,290 --> 00:54:09,990
yep the we're gonna get back to the
camera were gonna show a little bit too

851
00:54:09,990 --> 00:54:10,710
how we're

852
00:54:10,710 --> 00:54:17,710
now unconnected so let's see

853
00:54:27,250 --> 00:54:30,580
okay so basically deceased the

854
00:54:30,580 --> 00:54:33,720
no time left before yet it okay

855
00:54:33,720 --> 00:54:38,160
hit this is the CHT so basically how the

856
00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:41,640
injection west on for the Aeros of
course we needed to drive the stuff

857
00:54:41,640 --> 00:54:42,270
manually

858
00:54:42,270 --> 00:54:47,600
this is same CP 25-15 which is to come
bus controller is caught this

859
00:54:47,600 --> 00:54:50,690
under by SBI by the Arduino here

860
00:54:50,690 --> 00:54:54,520
then we have the the driver for come bus

861
00:54:54,520 --> 00:54:58,240
for their leg it way I mean for normal
France which is this one

862
00:54:58,240 --> 00:55:01,530
that is being used for the by the come
bus driver

863
00:55:01,530 --> 00:55:06,430
and that we have the Sun other come bus
driver that is directly connected to the

864
00:55:06,430 --> 00:55:07,350
utopian its

865
00:55:07,350 --> 00:55:10,530
on that we know so and the

866
00:55:10,530 --> 00:55:14,630
whether we are basically doing is where
are you seeing a normal come bus for

867
00:55:14,630 --> 00:55:15,690
injecting RR

868
00:55:15,690 --> 00:55:19,920
own frame on Dez this tension for
injecting the Aeros

869
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:23,710
and move general basically the CSTE

870
00:55:23,710 --> 00:55:30,130
and little more the the somehow these
here are some power supply here

871
00:55:30,130 --> 00:55:34,780
and the remote few update is pretty
simple

872
00:55:34,780 --> 00:55:38,340
Isis a so we're seeing the while my cock
on to the new mini pro

873
00:55:38,340 --> 00:55:42,260
SNSD that access by for we could add
father

874
00:55:42,260 --> 00:55:46,080
like the several thing worse he said the
st. so you can quickly change between

875
00:55:46,080 --> 00:55:46,610
them

876
00:55:46,610 --> 00:55:49,610
and just a Bluetooth mobile it could be
anything like yes'm

877
00:55:49,610 --> 00:55:54,380
and yeah and actually the sister GSM
development shield

878
00:55:54,380 --> 00:55:58,390
us a I was seen earlier the sisters
cheap said itself

879
00:55:58,390 --> 00:56:01,680
discourse around seven you a loss it's a
scene 900

880
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:05,580
its quad band so it works well wired and
its

881
00:56:05,580 --> 00:56:09,290
really small like you can see my finger
so

882
00:56:09,290 --> 00:56:13,850
with seven okay so yeah

883
00:56:13,850 --> 00:56:18,380
that'd and are and you thank

884
00:56:18,380 --> 00:56:23,730
yeah and that's thank you everybody for
being here today thank you for joining

885
00:56:23,730 --> 00:56:24,400
us

886
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:29,090
go to the ball please and stop this guy
into this conference go to the pool is

887
00:56:29,090 --> 00:56:29,610
awesome

888
00:56:29,610 --> 00:56:33,770
and thank you to all those who wants to
understand how and why

889
00:56:33,770 --> 00:56:35,630
things works thank you very much
