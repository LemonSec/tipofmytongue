1
00:00:00,919 --> 00:00:07,040
like Latin everyone on titty uncut oh we
are from Taiwan

2
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:10,490
well we are front mp5 and 25 research

3
00:00:10,490 --> 00:00:13,809
on the topic up this talk

4
00:00:13,809 --> 00:00:17,340
is are you can see you cannot see me

5
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:21,310
a Mac OS wicked uses other treats

6
00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:25,539
you have been long yet %uh since there
are more

7
00:00:25,539 --> 00:00:28,779
and more people start using Mac on so

8
00:00:28,779 --> 00:00:33,980
a techie Mac OS has become a trend as we
see more n

9
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:37,329
more mailer with other events a tech
techniques

10
00:00:37,329 --> 00:00:41,820
are make noise X in order to Ken
persisting

11
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:45,590
control and avoid detection nowhere has
started

12
00:00:45,590 --> 00:00:49,410
to atop are routed checks so I'm this
talk

13
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:53,010
arm we are going to introduce our server
on you drew kid

14
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:58,309
are tricks that are couldn't be detected
by existing security subway

15
00:00:58,309 --> 00:01:04,820
right 09 car and me founded our team
defy research

16
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:09,590
in Taiwan art isn't a lien where we are
doing cyber straight research

17
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:13,030
are we monitor analyze and track are

18
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:17,650
substrates us throughout the are
asia-pacific region

19
00:01:17,650 --> 00:01:21,100
oh we are also very interested in bar
ability

20
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:24,680
and our own yeah market research not
only

21
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:28,400
analyze exploit and armbar ability

22
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:32,100
and that is used by re: in drew a tech

23
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:35,750
we are also happy to look for new
programs

24
00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:41,430
in are a new pipe bomb are you in new
technology we are also

25
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:44,640
our members of are changer security
group

26
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:47,939
in Taiwan and we hold he con- every year
I'm the

27
00:01:47,939 --> 00:01:50,979
he called a nicer he can is star

28
00:01:50,979 --> 00:01:54,439
the largest security conference in
taiwan and

29
00:01:54,439 --> 00:01:57,829
we have like about 800 attendee every
year

30
00:01:57,829 --> 00:02:02,360
okay so many people say that

31
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:06,079
arm 2001 is our country without

32
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:09,390
without natural resource actually it is
role

33
00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:12,730
a 2001 has the most abandon cyberattack

34
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:17,269
natural resource in the war a special
APT and target examples

35
00:02:17,269 --> 00:02:21,900
are you know are many I think many APT
researchers they are

36
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:26,099
eager full are to to look for a simple
it's because

37
00:02:26,099 --> 00:02:29,840
because it is done easy to get samples
but are we

38
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:32,989
are it is not very difficult in taiwan
because you know

39
00:02:32,989 --> 00:02:36,450
due to are political issues and so you
know

40
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:39,840
the picture shows are the picture is
from our social

41
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:43,500
and 2012 some mission from a Taiwanese

42
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:48,840
rank are number two so

43
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:52,349
are doing suber three research in
Taiwanese interesting

44
00:02:52,349 --> 00:02:56,340
so um this is a short introduction of me

45
00:02:56,340 --> 00:03:00,209
are you my name is something and you can
just committee

46
00:03:00,209 --> 00:03:03,870
which is easier and I'm did either of
Tempe for research

47
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:07,920
and we liked astray and bye birdie.
research

48
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:11,670
and Nankai is our chief researcher

49
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:15,239
are he is a well-known bobbitt the
researcher and has

50
00:03:15,239 --> 00:03:18,440
in disclose in New Bern ability for many

51
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:21,760
years and he is major area of are

52
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:25,760
it's pure it expertise include rather
the research

53
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:30,069
exploit techniques armelle worth
detection more by specialty

54
00:03:30,069 --> 00:03:34,380
and he discover numerous in Windows
system and document the fisherman

55
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:35,000
titties

56
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,420
and so he yeah businessmen either they

57
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:41,989
and report to Microsoft are before I am

58
00:03:41,989 --> 00:03:45,500
OMX Group in recent years um we have

59
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:48,569
are started are expert exploration

60
00:03:48,569 --> 00:03:54,760
and discovery in programs are make noise
an on-time me frequently

61
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:59,930
give presentations in many security
conferences right so

62
00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:03,730
okay this is this are the our topics

63
00:04:03,730 --> 00:04:08,040
we are going to discuss today are more
than five tricks we are going to show

64
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:08,599
you

65
00:04:08,599 --> 00:04:11,780
over show you some other bands

66
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:15,590
process hiding techniques and armhole to

67
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:19,200
become approved no more user and

68
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:22,890
hard to direct SS Khurana memory from
userspace

69
00:04:22,890 --> 00:04:26,590
and also are met hours ten-point

70
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:32,120
9 arm you know there is our security
check security warning that if you want

71
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:34,550
to see lost their part he ARCA no

72
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:39,289
macho you have you look at the warning
but are we will show you how to lot

73
00:04:39,289 --> 00:04:43,700
Malaysia's Khanal model with I'll
warnings and

74
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:46,789
finally it will I was shown Atrix 2
again

75
00:04:46,789 --> 00:04:51,250
root permission okay so the first topic

76
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:56,020
are at the fence process hiding on

77
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:59,380
yeah the mean to reduce the iru billion
look it's

78
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:03,419
it is it was released our full
disclosure in

79
00:05:03,419 --> 00:05:07,159
to detail and are claimed that
capabilities

80
00:05:07,159 --> 00:05:10,880
that you can see like all hiding files

81
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:15,729
hide in the process how do you know you
sir hi dinner network our connection

82
00:05:15,729 --> 00:05:17,820
so yeah in this are

83
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:18,860
on I

84
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:23,330
very famous ya and the and because it is
open so so

85
00:05:23,330 --> 00:05:27,599
it our shows how shows people how to
implement

86
00:05:27,599 --> 00:05:31,909
lookit a Mac OS and also

87
00:05:31,909 --> 00:05:35,279
although it is already two years old it
is star

88
00:05:35,279 --> 00:05:38,849
yeah still I mean people are are still
discussing about this

89
00:05:38,849 --> 00:05:41,889
and we are going to and yup

90
00:05:41,889 --> 00:05:44,949
but there are many features but are we
only

91
00:05:44,949 --> 00:05:50,520
are we r going to focus on the process
hiding okay so

92
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:53,789
on this is harder than the height
process

93
00:05:53,789 --> 00:05:57,120
it directly modify Curnow objects to

94
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:01,409
our link a process for from dating coach
didn't get the list

95
00:06:01,409 --> 00:06:05,279
so it is a typical on de Krom

96
00:06:05,279 --> 00:06:12,279
our approach to to hide process itself
and this is the

97
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:17,650
our process a structure incur no in Mac
OS kernel

98
00:06:17,650 --> 00:06:21,139
and appeal East is the link least

99
00:06:21,139 --> 00:06:24,889
is a linguist it is the least overall
process

100
00:06:24,889 --> 00:06:28,050
and the first element is the list

101
00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:31,550
of or process so are

102
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:36,620
Ruben just okay so then just

103
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:40,870
yeah arming this and are you probably
noticed

104
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:45,009
that task pointer aren't this Arthur
Salman

105
00:06:45,009 --> 00:06:50,889
a its is a test pointer I will point to
another our test object and so

106
00:06:50,889 --> 00:06:54,060
all one process after will

107
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:57,389
have are have one person process after

108
00:06:57,389 --> 00:07:00,899
have are aren't s object so I'll

109
00:07:00,899 --> 00:07:04,249
actually alternates L alt ESC

110
00:07:04,249 --> 00:07:08,120
are also in another link at this time so

111
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:12,449
you as you can see are the task is are
the

112
00:07:12,449 --> 00:07:16,580
are there is our the Chen acute Chan

113
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:20,219
a test that that is aren't a link least
I'll test

114
00:07:20,219 --> 00:07:24,740
so there is there's another link
interest okay so

115
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:27,969
detecting building process hiding is
trivial

116
00:07:27,969 --> 00:07:31,649
that arm other with the way drilled in
hyde processes

117
00:07:31,649 --> 00:07:35,199
are very simple so it is it just are
links

118
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:39,889
up the least to hide process so detect
the end up doing is not difficult

119
00:07:39,889 --> 00:07:43,879
all weekend is the detect lobbying
process hiding

120
00:07:43,879 --> 00:07:47,810
by listing Teske and comparing ways
process

121
00:07:47,810 --> 00:07:51,550
so if yeah if the process is not a
showing

122
00:07:51,550 --> 00:07:54,599
in a task so that that is that means

123
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:57,849
arm someone is are linked are some
wanted

124
00:07:57,849 --> 00:08:02,459
are linked the arm process okay

125
00:08:02,459 --> 00:08:06,019
so I'm ruling actually cannot hide from

126
00:08:06,019 --> 00:08:09,740
active munter I E it you cannot see

127
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:14,610
hi did process using you it can only
hide from PS

128
00:08:14,610 --> 00:08:17,800
the PS come in you type yes and you
cannot see a process but

129
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:21,060
if you use active more into arm it will

130
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:27,349
see the process that hide it by ruling
and other information is Ruben cannot

131
00:08:27,349 --> 00:08:28,009
wrong

132
00:08:28,009 --> 00:08:33,569
I can only run on 10 points 7 okay so

133
00:08:33,569 --> 00:08:37,430
om volatility is are very well-known

134
00:08:37,430 --> 00:08:41,760
r Memory forensic tool and new version
of but it is a prose

135
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:45,149
a make or Saks so it can askin

136
00:08:45,149 --> 00:08:49,319
a Merry dump from from it always and so
it can't detect

137
00:08:49,319 --> 00:08:54,459
dubin look it's as well a purse again so

138
00:08:54,459 --> 00:08:58,130
are im may cause colonel process and
test is

139
00:08:58,130 --> 00:09:01,790
actually very complicated on there are
several

140
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:05,130
Lincoln lists to Chan those objects not
only

141
00:09:05,130 --> 00:09:08,260
our process and test they are a lot so

142
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:12,810
are lottttt checkbook to the checks ever
Lincoln list

143
00:09:12,810 --> 00:09:16,430
as well to make sure there is no
invisible

144
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:20,510
process so we are

145
00:09:20,510 --> 00:09:24,529
we tried to bypass lot duties so we arm

146
00:09:24,529 --> 00:09:27,760
on being the list we are linked P page

147
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:31,750
we only PG at least we are linked s so

148
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:36,889
then within bypass buttttt so this is
the way we

149
00:09:36,889 --> 00:09:40,079
bypass it okay

150
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:47,079
there's see a demo

151
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:06,930
if I know begin with relaunch
articulator and the

152
00:10:06,930 --> 00:10:13,930
Pido pick you later is to hunt

153
00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:28,759
right and now we are we lot our rockets
are gonna much you

154
00:10:28,759 --> 00:10:32,639
and we use

155
00:10:32,639 --> 00:10:35,740
see as I said cyst our city control

156
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:39,370
to our space by the P ID that we would
like to

157
00:10:39,370 --> 00:10:46,370
to height

158
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:50,410
I so yeah you as you can see there are
two good days

159
00:10:50,410 --> 00:10:56,930
missed in in the 18 12 so now this
process is

160
00:10:56,930 --> 00:11:03,360
invisible now and now we

161
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:07,240
arm we're trying to dump

162
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:14,240
memory

163
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:36,910
it you press some time right own okay so

164
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:40,780
now we can use volatility to to show are

165
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:44,170
now this is how we use about 32

166
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:47,870
to read other married to pass the
American Mary dump

167
00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:51,480
and the see if their is the process

168
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:58,420
paper later so

169
00:11:58,420 --> 00:12:01,890
as you can see our own it is sorted by P
ID

170
00:12:01,890 --> 00:12:05,770
and the PRD 200 is missed not not shown
here

171
00:12:05,770 --> 00:12:09,070
yes ok not use this

172
00:12:09,070 --> 00:12:16,070
approach we can bypass but it

173
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:31,250
okay so hide and detect a process are is
like

174
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:34,860
are and on cat-and-mouse game in kernel

175
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:38,089
Owens some someone release a new way to
detect

176
00:12:38,089 --> 00:12:41,240
are theirs OS a new way to bypass is

177
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:44,680
you know if you need to raise the
approached you you have

178
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:48,260
are yeah in future they're definitely
someone will

179
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:52,250
bypass you or ad:tech you so you're not
doing this stuff

180
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:55,390
is really hard work's are you need to
take into

181
00:12:55,390 --> 00:12:58,570
complicate canard Jesse need to
implement a

182
00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:02,240
kernel module you need to have
guaranteed despaired stability

183
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:06,630
of your kids so however

184
00:13:06,630 --> 00:13:10,079
arm during this research arm

185
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:14,839
we noticed something very interesting so

186
00:13:14,839 --> 00:13:18,950
this see a demo home no

187
00:13:18,950 --> 00:13:22,480
know we use the arm the crew kid that we
have

188
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:29,480
to height a process and we found
something very interesting

189
00:13:49,589 --> 00:13:52,889
okay sam we our lunch the calculator

190
00:13:52,889 --> 00:13:59,889
and the P ID is

191
00:14:00,009 --> 00:14:07,009
forked end by

192
00:14:08,730 --> 00:14:12,260
Cassano are we I use are rockets to

193
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:19,260
height is process

194
00:14:27,749 --> 00:14:34,749
I so are you cannot seek a cure to now

195
00:14:37,090 --> 00:14:38,380
alright

196
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:42,300
okay so own but are there was

197
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:45,350
I'll someday I we've noticed are

198
00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:48,700
a comment ken actually very easy

199
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:52,890
to see all process no matter what way
you hide

200
00:14:52,890 --> 00:14:56,240
hahaha I where the US but noted but do
keep the US

201
00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:00,649
are too high the process isn't there

202
00:15:00,649 --> 00:15:03,899
lunch Cpl least upgrade I

203
00:15:03,899 --> 00:15:07,190
find your key ID so you can see it this
process

204
00:15:07,190 --> 00:15:10,850
and so how are what happen

205
00:15:10,850 --> 00:15:17,850
yeah the me it's explain

206
00:15:24,929 --> 00:15:28,869
okay so it we go it it is so I use them
all major

207
00:15:28,869 --> 00:15:32,089
dead are from demo you can see their cum
n

208
00:15:32,089 --> 00:15:35,790
overused to listo process this come in
is purely

209
00:15:35,790 --> 00:15:39,239
are you some more a vacation and older
date are

210
00:15:39,239 --> 00:15:42,980
it your status in your some more and it
is

211
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:47,459
very simple way to detect and invisible
process from userspace

212
00:15:47,459 --> 00:15:50,629
only use a space no matter what magic's

213
00:15:50,629 --> 00:15:54,139
are you are using in the kernel Sonam
enter upon

214
00:15:54,139 --> 00:15:57,910
our home any corn objects you modified
so arm

215
00:15:57,910 --> 00:16:01,589
there is a mall to look enlist or
process that you hired

216
00:16:01,589 --> 00:16:06,029
internal it is because of

217
00:16:06,029 --> 00:16:09,799
lunch the are the reason is that
launched the bunch the is

218
00:16:09,799 --> 00:16:12,970
monitoring 00 process creation and

219
00:16:12,970 --> 00:16:16,869
a termination it inch it is in charge up
their process creation

220
00:16:16,869 --> 00:16:19,899
so its maintains a job list

221
00:16:19,899 --> 00:16:23,389
in years or more our lunch Cpl is the
tool

222
00:16:23,389 --> 00:16:26,720
to come you can't with lunch the it can
is the

223
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:32,279
is lead list 0 jobs so if you want to
hide process you have to hit the always

224
00:16:32,279 --> 00:16:35,769
lunch the so

225
00:16:35,769 --> 00:16:39,119
arm we're going to see more details of
lunch the

226
00:16:39,119 --> 00:16:42,269
I'll since our lunch City ok

227
00:16:42,269 --> 00:16:46,259
can our list process so we start from
here

228
00:16:46,259 --> 00:16:50,169
it is arlen City ok

229
00:16:50,169 --> 00:16:53,220
the called over lunch you feel you can
see this function

230
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:56,540
yes are the key %uh the keep our

231
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:59,540
so home use this

232
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:04,519
call these come in and this come in will
send a message to lunch the

233
00:17:04,519 --> 00:17:11,519
okay and I'll finally it will call this
function to send message to launch the

234
00:17:11,569 --> 00:17:15,069
and learn in lunch D I'll the margin

235
00:17:15,069 --> 00:17:18,240
isn't right up the I'll list

236
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:23,439
Oprah all jobs is in this function and

237
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:28,669
I'll as you can see a job object is
actually put that process

238
00:17:28,669 --> 00:17:34,320
in lunch D so arm yep if we can look for
the job

239
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:37,629
in the a large the then we can our list
a process

240
00:17:37,629 --> 00:17:42,240
or we can try to are linked list and

241
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:45,370
are its job has our job MGR structure

242
00:17:45,370 --> 00:17:49,470
for men German arm information so we
need to look for a job

243
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:53,389
MGR in large t K

244
00:17:53,389 --> 00:17:56,970
however on the same boat in lunch D is
removed

245
00:17:56,970 --> 00:18:02,149
so are here are some hint are for you
that our whole wheat reverse-engineered

246
00:18:02,149 --> 00:18:05,309
the lunch D we use some string to
identify the call

247
00:18:05,309 --> 00:18:08,690
here is the so Scott but in lunch the
you cannot see

248
00:18:08,690 --> 00:18:11,860
are punchan simple so are we use

249
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:15,779
likes this strain to identify the call
and

250
00:18:15,779 --> 00:18:19,139
I'll try to look for the job MGR

251
00:18:19,139 --> 00:18:22,730
structure ok sooo in love

252
00:18:22,730 --> 00:18:26,529
in this much and you can also see our
own there is are good

253
00:18:26,529 --> 00:18:31,120
job MGR so our own from this motion arm

254
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:34,220
I you know if we can access this option

255
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:37,399
YouTube MGR arm we can list

256
00:18:37,399 --> 00:18:41,129
out jobs or look for specific jobs in
lunch D

257
00:18:41,129 --> 00:18:45,470
but arm it is not easy because no simple
and and you have to

258
00:18:45,470 --> 00:18:49,950
to try so you know we do first

259
00:18:49,950 --> 00:18:50,670
I

260
00:18:50,670 --> 00:18:54,590
with analyzed their growth job MGR and
we farm

261
00:18:54,590 --> 00:18:58,360
it is in the arm they tossed

262
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:01,540
section yes so

263
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:04,930
yeah I you see year you can see our own
that

264
00:19:04,930 --> 00:19:09,760
this a place is around in the farm this
place so

265
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:13,930
own okay so the way we are linked

266
00:19:13,930 --> 00:19:17,190
a job in lunch D is on the process we
have to get

267
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:20,910
good permission the second are in
numerous process

268
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:24,240
our lunch the and get lunch details and

269
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:28,230
tried to retreat our lunch the memory
and find a dissection

270
00:19:28,230 --> 00:19:32,710
and find are yeah the next and the most
important thing is

271
00:19:32,710 --> 00:19:37,310
find Road MGR and you have to try are
the airman in day

272
00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:40,870
arm decision on the up the arm lunch D

273
00:19:40,870 --> 00:19:44,880
and you that the way we verify it is a
lunch D is

274
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:48,430
a list that their you have to very by
the point is it a lot

275
00:19:48,430 --> 00:19:53,180
relaunch the real our route job mg
object it

276
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:57,060
if we'd get the our job a good job man
gör

277
00:19:57,060 --> 00:20:01,670
then we can start to enumerate job and
GR and get job then

278
00:20:01,670 --> 00:20:05,730
are use in the link at least hinder up
between the job

279
00:20:05,730 --> 00:20:11,820
and we can find talking a job and we are
linked the job right

280
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:18,820
we have a show them all here as well

281
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:02,030
right I'll yet yet now continue that the
demo that we had %uh

282
00:21:02,030 --> 00:21:06,430
so-so arm know we use look it to hide
the process but

283
00:21:06,430 --> 00:21:10,250
you aren't prior somone we can still US
lunch

284
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:14,810
city also see the process now we will
try to modify the

285
00:21:14,810 --> 00:21:17,940
are the data in Dutch the so

286
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:24,940
then we can Heights the process

287
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:39,679
okay so now we are we no

288
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:46,120
we just are 5 our the Tiger is for

289
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:53,120
25

290
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:57,160
as this tool can are keogh the job

291
00:21:57,160 --> 00:22:01,230
in large t not not cure it your job just
are linked it

292
00:22:01,230 --> 00:22:07,550
I so

293
00:22:07,550 --> 00:22:10,890
with it so now we try to find it the job
again

294
00:22:10,890 --> 00:22:15,910
it is invisible now eso

295
00:22:15,910 --> 00:22:19,510
are hiding a a process in make OS

296
00:22:19,510 --> 00:22:22,520
you need to deal with something colonel
and and

297
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:29,520
there's a space as well

298
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:37,880
alright so on after hiding for us as a
route

299
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:42,799
are the next up as a rootkit on the next
importance the institu-

300
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:46,130
are is don't give permission to a normal
user

301
00:22:46,130 --> 00:22:49,970
so in falling inside I'm going to show
you a whole

302
00:22:49,970 --> 00:22:53,870
always sign to the grant permission to a
normal user

303
00:22:53,870 --> 00:22:57,200
okay here's the

304
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:00,750
demonstration that you can see aren't
the user who Mrs

305
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:05,100
arm RBM it it is actually are no more
user

306
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:08,110
and om are but

307
00:23:08,110 --> 00:23:11,690
we US K k txt state arm

308
00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:16,630
to check the camacho are 9 in cut the
true is it

309
00:23:16,630 --> 00:23:20,419
in the incur no but art no we we
couldn't find that

310
00:23:20,419 --> 00:23:24,649
and we use our tool KX the lot is our
2002 lot

311
00:23:24,649 --> 00:23:29,919
the kernel module and you can see

312
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:33,120
its successfully loaded their kernel
module

313
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:36,130
but it is still a normal user yeah

314
00:23:36,130 --> 00:23:39,500
so a normal user can daughter camacho

315
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:45,200
so how did how do we that is aka

316
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:50,130
it is because up their hosts privilege
yeah the hosts preached arm

317
00:23:50,130 --> 00:23:53,289
can are with prosperous you can't do
maintenance

318
00:23:53,289 --> 00:23:58,539
include in lot commercial you can load
con mucho you can't get into kernel you

319
00:23:58,539 --> 00:23:59,010
can do

320
00:23:59,010 --> 00:24:02,919
many things soul this freeleech is very
important it

321
00:24:02,919 --> 00:24:05,919
are actually arm more important than

322
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:09,350
then arm it is us of arm

323
00:24:09,350 --> 00:24:13,490
almost similar to root soul arm in host

324
00:24:13,490 --> 00:24:16,769
project you can see arm this element

325
00:24:16,769 --> 00:24:20,700
spent a special is arms story in there

326
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:23,870
are privileged information Osprey bitch
information

327
00:24:23,870 --> 00:24:28,190
and hos privilege is our list here are
no more it is

328
00:24:28,190 --> 00:24:31,630
1 and with our special privilege arm

329
00:24:31,630 --> 00:24:35,779
is all to and waste

330
00:24:35,779 --> 00:24:39,970
hospital each you can do many things
like here yeah at this

331
00:24:39,970 --> 00:24:43,220
the you can look con mucho okay so

332
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:46,490
I'll and also was was hospital each

333
00:24:46,490 --> 00:24:51,200
you can control test cannot s and I will
show you

334
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:55,740
are what the what pablo it is okay so

335
00:24:55,740 --> 00:25:00,100
how to Upton host bridge the press incur
no you have to find

336
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:04,889
are real host this simple from colonel
you pass colonel and find symbol

337
00:25:04,889 --> 00:25:09,779
and then find target asked all which
task your want to assign

338
00:25:09,779 --> 00:25:13,720
the permission the privilege and are
assign

339
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:17,250
this point are real host special tool

340
00:25:17,250 --> 00:25:20,860
to are task i DK host

341
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:24,080
then this task has our privilege

342
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:27,409
and no need with are no need to become
good it

343
00:25:27,409 --> 00:25:31,610
or already have a have their privilege
okay so

344
00:25:31,610 --> 00:25:36,440
own soho how do we implement

345
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:41,409
are ok it was host very rich so are
there are several ways like I'll call

346
00:25:41,409 --> 00:25:41,809
hawk

347
00:25:41,809 --> 00:25:46,649
like system called hook & Co patching
and %uh the

348
00:25:46,649 --> 00:25:50,010
in vice lie I will show you how the way
to call pitch to

349
00:25:50,010 --> 00:25:53,870
to our make you look it was this
function so own

350
00:25:53,870 --> 00:25:57,529
we r tried to replace system call table
and then

351
00:25:57,529 --> 00:26:01,159
we find this address and then we try to

352
00:26:01,159 --> 00:26:04,480
match the court here and all it is
global

353
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:09,870
effectiveness like arm you be if n you
so on to a request for permission

354
00:26:09,870 --> 00:26:13,889
and they're ok it will work were granted
permission without asking without and

355
00:26:13,889 --> 00:26:14,360
checking

356
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:17,419
or so own in this

357
00:26:17,419 --> 00:26:20,830
motion is this I'll yet it is tripp

358
00:26:20,830 --> 00:26:24,559
this Pendle in charge of the I'll check
in the

359
00:26:24,559 --> 00:26:29,350
the hospital permission up that s but we
modify the call here

360
00:26:29,350 --> 00:26:32,620
then I'll went every time

361
00:26:32,620 --> 00:26:35,899
met when that next time %uh this disco
is is called

362
00:26:35,899 --> 00:26:39,309
arm it will return horace give their
permission

363
00:26:39,309 --> 00:26:42,500
okay

364
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:46,250
so instead all call page incorporating
is not easy

365
00:26:46,250 --> 00:26:50,100
is typical we have another up by the way
that it

366
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:53,899
that this way is easiest aunt
undetectable

367
00:26:53,899 --> 00:26:58,000
by a transitional detection and stable
how do we do this

368
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,220
very simple we just

369
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:04,270
I'll find the arm that host privilege

370
00:27:04,270 --> 00:27:07,700
object and then we specify are

371
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:11,809
total :1 in are so %uh the no more

372
00:27:11,809 --> 00:27:17,409
our host privilege it's the same ways
the arms special privilege sold

373
00:27:17,409 --> 00:27:22,320
RF to modify these we call it that I
pitch with the if the page this data

374
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:25,440
then it is are Bobo effectiveness that

375
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:32,440
are every user can have permission to a
lot camacho

376
00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:37,889
okay so I'll not our no more user can do
many things

377
00:27:37,889 --> 00:27:41,570
now ways hospital reached our hall and
what

378
00:27:41,570 --> 00:27:45,049
are no more user can do fry you some all
and come on

379
00:27:45,049 --> 00:27:48,080
I would our I'm going to show you so the
first

380
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:51,510
are direct kernel memory access from use
their mom

381
00:27:51,510 --> 00:27:54,669
at ISIS are Neil that

382
00:27:54,669 --> 00:27:58,350
sees our mentors all 10 points 6

383
00:27:58,350 --> 00:28:02,720
arm it restrict asked excess franca not
ask

384
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:07,510
so arm tax poppy i the origin of the
tests will be ID can be used

385
00:28:07,510 --> 00:28:11,350
to access code no but are cannot ask

386
00:28:11,350 --> 00:28:14,879
but it is not supported arm all that new

387
00:28:14,879 --> 00:28:19,250
our own dick could not have sold are
young new version of are all

388
00:28:19,250 --> 00:28:23,029
may cause X are this our function cannot
be used

389
00:28:23,029 --> 00:28:26,879
to excess cannot ask so no matter you
you're privileged able

390
00:28:26,879 --> 00:28:31,720
Nora what a pure Yost so there is no

391
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:35,429
legitimate all way aren't that many
euros

392
00:28:35,429 --> 00:28:39,580
for is inspecting our kernel memory

393
00:28:39,580 --> 00:28:42,580
but I'm going to show you away so

394
00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:46,360
now we make it possible again

395
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:49,830
directors excess are we we don't just

396
00:28:49,830 --> 00:28:53,179
10-spoke the ID instead we use per se
sir said

397
00:28:53,179 --> 00:28:56,619
tasks this API I can are get

398
00:28:56,619 --> 00:28:59,799
are object I'll the text

399
00:28:59,799 --> 00:29:03,980
dist weekend rate we were returned a
text this subject and

400
00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:07,340
this object is actually the colonel task

401
00:29:07,340 --> 00:29:11,020
so from use them all are you when you
called this function you

402
00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:14,289
you unit you'd need their host bridge
analyst

403
00:29:14,289 --> 00:29:17,299
and you can call this function and after
college function

404
00:29:17,299 --> 00:29:20,730
are you can't get the kernel test so
tensest

405
00:29:20,730 --> 00:29:24,210
you can access all test are you are on
this list

406
00:29:24,210 --> 00:29:28,490
so are using disco all weekend saw two
XS

407
00:29:28,490 --> 00:29:33,450
alt ESC and I even you seen a VM group
MBM right

408
00:29:33,450 --> 00:29:36,480
to retreat and a right test up girl

409
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:41,450
test memory and also for example we can
just throw said state

410
00:29:41,450 --> 00:29:44,980
to to dynamic let library injection

411
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:48,520
the other like when does the early
injection so

412
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:51,789
I'll yeah so we make it happen again

413
00:29:51,789 --> 00:29:57,669
now you can at the excess there cannot s

414
00:29:57,669 --> 00:30:00,869
okay so om next themes ways

415
00:30:00,869 --> 00:30:04,320
host very rich a no more user can

416
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:08,200
not only lot camacho and

417
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:12,299
on also we are going to show you how to
bypass kernel module

418
00:30:12,299 --> 00:30:15,340
very vocation I'll make Rs on

419
00:30:15,340 --> 00:30:19,179
temple in nine

420
00:30:19,179 --> 00:30:23,700
okay so this is Dustin dye way that are
you want a lot

421
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:27,250
kernel module own temp 19 so put

422
00:30:27,250 --> 00:30:31,520
the kernel module file file it home has
to be a file

423
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:34,879
I into it has to be in this father

424
00:30:34,879 --> 00:30:38,100
it this past system library extension

425
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:41,350
wrong K E XT lot told lot

426
00:30:41,350 --> 00:30:45,289
the file if the kernel module is not
signed

427
00:30:45,289 --> 00:30:48,990
always will always pop-up a warning
message

428
00:30:48,990 --> 00:30:53,549
like this so it is a third party
commercial and yet

429
00:30:53,549 --> 00:30:59,010
yeah it is a one in for you

430
00:30:59,010 --> 00:31:02,100
okay so all we implemented Arg

431
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:05,179
mike is take my KX the Lord

432
00:31:05,179 --> 00:31:08,780
and so we can load aka no module from
neps

433
00:31:08,780 --> 00:31:12,070
and arm file is not

434
00:31:12,070 --> 00:31:15,440
required all weekend lot on the larger

435
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:18,629
on the fly for example from a memory
from

436
00:31:18,629 --> 00:31:21,720
even from network with and uncle a chunk
of

437
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:24,849
our date up from nap or and it could be
our

438
00:31:24,849 --> 00:31:27,990
Camacho and we don't have to write file
and we cannot

439
00:31:27,990 --> 00:31:31,330
this as a Camacho so own

440
00:31:31,330 --> 00:31:35,990
and are this tool can lot upon the
module without verification

441
00:31:35,990 --> 00:31:40,049
no warning what no one message you don't
have to side and sign

442
00:31:40,049 --> 00:31:43,240
the kernel module so on and

443
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:46,389
alway are no need to page

444
00:31:46,389 --> 00:31:52,379
kstp

445
00:31:52,379 --> 00:31:56,760
there the reason is this API Kest
request

446
00:31:56,760 --> 00:32:01,570
we use this API to lot come to my job so
this API can help us to

447
00:32:01,570 --> 00:32:06,059
arm lot commander directly without any
check ins so

448
00:32:06,059 --> 00:32:09,330
all you as you can see are if you

449
00:32:09,330 --> 00:32:13,859
specify your own condo module you have
to are follow the format

450
00:32:13,859 --> 00:32:16,909
and then you can USDA this API

451
00:32:16,909 --> 00:32:20,970
to lot you work on a larger ok for you
golf course you have to

452
00:32:20,970 --> 00:32:26,490
have the permission the host for each

453
00:32:26,490 --> 00:32:30,020
okay so in this light you can see are it
is

454
00:32:30,020 --> 00:32:33,139
%uh the source call and the first

455
00:32:33,139 --> 00:32:36,159
that the called actually checked the
host

456
00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:39,899
preach so not you I D is a hospital
Beach

457
00:32:39,899 --> 00:32:43,820
so yeah with this our hospital each then
you can start

458
00:32:43,820 --> 00:32:46,879
to lot the larger and one other thing

459
00:32:46,879 --> 00:32:50,369
important thing is all you have to make
your own

460
00:32:50,369 --> 00:32:54,030
am KST it is the colonel

461
00:32:54,030 --> 00:32:57,899
module object okay so here is the
structure

462
00:32:57,899 --> 00:33:01,090
over the object and here is the are
simple

463
00:33:01,090 --> 00:33:05,830
%uh the pianist is a yeah you have to
follow the format and yet though

464
00:33:05,830 --> 00:33:09,490
space by the offset size and your father
space

465
00:33:09,490 --> 00:33:12,720
are follow the spec and you can

466
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:18,869
lot your own camacho and yet no warrant
ones

467
00:33:18,869 --> 00:33:24,770
guess so there's CR demo

468
00:33:24,770 --> 00:33:28,149
so in this damn all our first arm

469
00:33:28,149 --> 00:33:31,230
we work them I will we want them all
that I'll

470
00:33:31,230 --> 00:33:34,990
using are possibly which to arm

471
00:33:34,990 --> 00:33:38,020
to those things and then to are okay

472
00:33:38,020 --> 00:33:41,889
%uh using hospira beach tote lot armed
gonna module

473
00:33:41,889 --> 00:33:45,889
and then after Logano kernel module

474
00:33:45,889 --> 00:33:50,000
I'll then we will show your are bypassed
the

475
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:57,000
arm Khan a larger one

476
00:34:00,340 --> 00:34:04,929
okay now we installed

477
00:34:04,929 --> 00:34:11,840
can imagine and

478
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:14,720
sup this page are modify the

479
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:18,230
the the could not a tot that are we met
the

480
00:34:18,230 --> 00:34:22,870
are Haas privileged our grand all host
are

481
00:34:22,870 --> 00:34:27,580
Haas privilege to all users so now are
you even know my user 10

482
00:34:27,580 --> 00:34:34,580
thought arm kinda like you

483
00:34:46,060 --> 00:34:50,440
okay so no always Lord kernel module use
instant our way

484
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:54,399
you can stand away not done our rates of
now you

485
00:34:54,399 --> 00:34:59,770
can see be up but we have we already
have prosper image so we can do this

486
00:34:59,770 --> 00:35:05,070
as a normal user but our this is our
that message a warning message you can

487
00:35:05,070 --> 00:35:05,869
still see

488
00:35:05,869 --> 00:35:12,869
because it we on use instant our way to
a lot on the modern up

489
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:26,750
as you can see is is a is a normal user

490
00:35:26,750 --> 00:35:29,760
episode not not good

491
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:33,880
not uprooted user but yeah RR canard are
our

492
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:37,320
patch gonna pitch arm when the
permission to this user

493
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:44,320
to all user actually

494
00:35:50,970 --> 00:35:53,900
okay so I'll yep in

495
00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:57,320
to a this

496
00:35:57,320 --> 00:36:04,320
are Camacho is just loaded

497
00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:28,989
alright so I'll did you see that are
used to my text my kese lots a lot lot

498
00:36:28,989 --> 00:36:29,809
kernel module

499
00:36:29,809 --> 00:36:33,529
and without warning is this time there
is no one wins

500
00:36:33,529 --> 00:36:40,529
yeah I N the come under is are loaded

501
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:03,630
alright arm all their chase that we show
basically requires some foodage

502
00:37:03,630 --> 00:37:07,150
list the hospital which right so

503
00:37:07,150 --> 00:37:11,160
are so for real kid you still need at
least one time

504
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:15,230
to be unhurt and so here I'm going to
show you a

505
00:37:15,230 --> 00:37:18,829
treats are to treat bad r-kan easily

506
00:37:18,829 --> 00:37:24,560
get good permission is not that year
they just a trick

507
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:27,700
so um I'll basically all mean

508
00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:31,319
when when an application require
permission

509
00:37:31,319 --> 00:37:34,990
such as are installation or are so

510
00:37:34,990 --> 00:37:38,190
it we or use this API to up ten

511
00:37:38,190 --> 00:37:42,569
author are Asian from security if you
are

512
00:37:42,569 --> 00:37:46,060
program are met almost 20 per your mind
need known this

513
00:37:46,060 --> 00:37:49,589
API and we you we using this API you can

514
00:37:49,589 --> 00:37:52,900
get authorization then you can do

515
00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:56,400
are you can have permission to do things
so it is

516
00:37:56,400 --> 00:38:02,900
I'll okay

517
00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:07,810
so other an app I'll will call this
function to request the ping me

518
00:38:07,810 --> 00:38:08,550
permission

519
00:38:08,550 --> 00:38:11,740
to what does security and secured the
you will

520
00:38:11,740 --> 00:38:15,730
home lot the configuration from here to
know

521
00:38:15,730 --> 00:38:18,910
all which permission it require and

522
00:38:18,910 --> 00:38:21,910
security will pop up a message to

523
00:38:21,910 --> 00:38:25,800
show 2x user to park pass or the papers
or so

524
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:30,240
after type that pass war all security
will return

525
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:33,640
are talk until to all the

526
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:36,810
a pic Asian was this token a vacation

527
00:38:36,810 --> 00:38:40,040
can I 10 same

528
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:43,119
ken starr can't do something are 10

529
00:38:43,119 --> 00:38:48,119
waz permission and lunch D I was this
but good book and much do will

530
00:38:48,119 --> 00:38:51,440
use another permission to lunch the

531
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:58,420
our vacation okay there are many

532
00:38:58,420 --> 00:39:02,010
authorization company they Asians in
here so

533
00:39:02,010 --> 00:39:07,319
yet the lot and you can choose what you
need what what kind of authorization you

534
00:39:07,319 --> 00:39:07,740
need

535
00:39:07,740 --> 00:39:12,660
and you just space by the then unit and
you think that there are other Asian it

536
00:39:12,660 --> 00:39:13,990
use that have the pestle

537
00:39:13,990 --> 00:39:17,470
but there yes 01 all

538
00:39:17,470 --> 00:39:20,819
discoloration is very interesting is are

539
00:39:20,819 --> 00:39:24,160
is the parts com dot hair pulled us
subway up

540
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:28,109
they does Ken and it shows are

541
00:39:28,109 --> 00:39:31,400
this a vacation is trying to check

542
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:35,050
for new a poll prior ID somewhere

543
00:39:35,050 --> 00:39:38,140
type your password to allow this so

544
00:39:38,140 --> 00:39:41,619
where you allow this is just checked EPL
provided

545
00:39:41,619 --> 00:39:44,859
somewhere so after

546
00:39:44,859 --> 00:39:48,569
UserType pass or are you can get the
permission

547
00:39:48,569 --> 00:39:52,390
now but I think are you up most over
user we'll talk this

548
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:55,410
as well without any any your

549
00:39:55,410 --> 00:40:01,599
fit in any any thing different so it is
the tricks

550
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:05,339
that you might on them may await
developer or

551
00:40:05,339 --> 00:40:08,680
our big guys can use to to get
permission on this

552
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:12,450
okay so conclusion

553
00:40:12,450 --> 00:40:15,480
that arm today I'll we introduce are the
best

554
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:18,630
our process Higdon treats especially we

555
00:40:18,630 --> 00:40:22,290
I introduce the our lunch D %uh the that

556
00:40:22,290 --> 00:40:26,380
arm for publication control from you
some more and so you'd

557
00:40:26,380 --> 00:40:30,140
if you want to hide process you have two
deals not only colonel you have that the

558
00:40:30,140 --> 00:40:30,760
OS the

559
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:35,030
you some on as well so and also we

560
00:40:35,030 --> 00:40:39,310
are all we also introduced to a
privileged normal user

561
00:40:39,310 --> 00:40:42,740
that our own you know actually

562
00:40:42,740 --> 00:40:47,329
in in Mecosta not other I'll take a sh
the permission country it's very

563
00:40:47,329 --> 00:40:48,550
complicated so

564
00:40:48,550 --> 00:40:52,250
I think there are still many many things
you can try to

565
00:40:52,250 --> 00:40:55,720
to do that so always host

566
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:59,940
privileged that we can't do many things
that because are you have don't have to

567
00:40:59,940 --> 00:41:00,349
though

568
00:41:00,349 --> 00:41:03,530
to be a route so

569
00:41:03,530 --> 00:41:06,790
maybe other me shadow will not feel
anything weird

570
00:41:06,790 --> 00:41:10,339
if you are Justin a normal user when
when

571
00:41:10,339 --> 00:41:15,540
you are you lookit install in the system
then are we introduce a new way to a

572
00:41:15,540 --> 00:41:16,630
direct SS

573
00:41:16,630 --> 00:41:20,250
cannot ask and it is

574
00:41:20,250 --> 00:41:25,579
arm very easy easy way to access to no
memory

575
00:41:25,579 --> 00:41:28,690
and and also we introduce are loath

576
00:41:28,690 --> 00:41:33,440
kernel module are how how do we a lot on
my Joel without warnings

577
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:36,569
and also Atrix 2 10 good

578
00:41:36,569 --> 00:41:40,440
permission

579
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:43,540
okay so all there's almost in that

580
00:41:43,540 --> 00:41:47,119
not on the their kid tricks that all we
are

581
00:41:47,119 --> 00:41:50,619
actually develop in sister merge onto a
verifiable

582
00:41:50,619 --> 00:41:54,230
Mac OS X in all on Windows the research
SBB

583
00:41:54,230 --> 00:41:57,500
our rate is laggin 2006 or two thousand

584
00:41:57,500 --> 00:42:01,200
7i I don't remember about it is
basically a rooted

585
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:04,530
checker to to check you worker now is it
colonel is

586
00:42:04,530 --> 00:42:07,770
are not modified by lookit

587
00:42:07,770 --> 00:42:11,460
so we are developing this tool and we
are going to have

588
00:42:11,460 --> 00:42:14,630
to give you a preview up this tool

589
00:42:14,630 --> 00:42:17,690
and this tool is basically a rookie
scanner

590
00:42:17,690 --> 00:42:21,530
and it is our country it wastes are

591
00:42:21,530 --> 00:42:26,130
comprehensive checkup it checked cause
sis dis intell table

592
00:42:26,130 --> 00:42:29,369
attract a bowl ided table kernel
functions

593
00:42:29,369 --> 00:42:32,730
policy permission and then arm and

594
00:42:32,730 --> 00:42:35,829
network so we check every everything
that

595
00:42:35,829 --> 00:42:39,520
might be arm used fire took it

596
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:42,710
that the but this is underdeveloped
development we we r

597
00:42:42,710 --> 00:42:49,710
yet giving you a de mano

598
00:43:52,610 --> 00:43:59,610
this is that way we monitor process
creation

599
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:36,200
I know we use our tool to scan the
kernel and it your checks his ankle

600
00:44:37,650 --> 00:44:40,740
church make tribe check RTT table

601
00:44:40,740 --> 00:44:47,740
check kannel functions at

602
00:44:53,240 --> 00:44:57,000
of are on yeah I'm sorry %uh %uh

603
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:00,299
it II well we use the I'll

604
00:45:00,299 --> 00:45:06,770
me okay

605
00:45:06,770 --> 00:45:09,960
so %uh this this our function

606
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:14,470
I'm sorry I'm

607
00:45:14,470 --> 00:45:18,119
you if you want a long-term

608
00:45:18,119 --> 00:45:22,030
arm that yes easy as all aren't you is
jobs nope

609
00:45:22,030 --> 00:45:25,210
is are more entered the process creation
right so

610
00:45:25,210 --> 00:45:28,480
it will insert some court in the kernel
so

611
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:31,680
are we use our two little check this
hook

612
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:38,680
and it in discovered that the whole now
so

613
00:45:40,980 --> 00:45:45,180
are no doubt to others their outdoor
courts we discovered

614
00:45:45,180 --> 00:45:52,180
that yeah is hooked by by their tour are

615
00:46:08,220 --> 00:46:11,690
okay so that it a I'm sorry that the
screen is

616
00:46:11,690 --> 00:46:14,789
