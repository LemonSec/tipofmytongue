1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:03,010
I'm glad to present their a.m. research

2
00:00:03,010 --> 00:00:06,600
we essentially the Dhoni as: and there's
a

3
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:09,900
prove it does said now the sick and the
follow-up to

4
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:13,429
have the truest the pot

5
00:00:13,429 --> 00:00:16,720
other search but we present an ASCII
alina

6
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:21,180
Kalu blip in a hike in a box I'm going
to

7
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:24,430
briefly recap I have but there we ended
the year

8
00:00:24,430 --> 00:00:27,730
explain back in October so that you have
an understanding of

9
00:00:27,730 --> 00:00:31,840
Ortiz I S and their which had the basic
attacks

10
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:35,760
between it is close and then going to
present some are

11
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:38,930
tracks related to the sheep industry

12
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:42,239
and to minimize Monaco and they work for

13
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:45,520
te Mike research and the

14
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:49,070
services Jain what projet we've Kylie
colleague mine and a

15
00:00:49,070 --> 00:00:54,010
I sound dumb independent researcher saw

16
00:00:54,010 --> 00:00:57,329
find anything combat any question may
have

17
00:00:57,329 --> 00:01:00,350
on a biggest work i point you to

18
00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:03,460
Anna to the presentation a lot of tone
can take a box

19
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:08,180
sole reason I'd love I want first dole
cannery bowling tonight

20
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:11,460
so you can easily dont the pea aphid

21
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:16,330
and check their whenever question you
may have or you can come back to be at

22
00:01:16,330 --> 00:01:17,310
Dustin

23
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:22,150
being me okay so to give a quick
introduction

24
00:01:22,150 --> 00:01:26,610
he asked is it a crime to find out how
to make the identification system

25
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:30,570
okay is a system for tracking best South

26
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:34,130
ships on a global skier

27
00:01:34,130 --> 00:01:37,509
were lied okay so he's used

28
00:01:37,509 --> 00:01:40,920
for ships

29
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:44,149
to communicate with nearby ships the %ah

30
00:01:44,149 --> 00:01:48,040
review frequency and he's also years

31
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:51,409
to you for communication on from V

32
00:01:51,409 --> 00:01:57,420
port to the ship's to control the sheep
for example the entry into the port

33
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:00,899
ought to be should be sheep they don't
crush against rocks

34
00:02:00,899 --> 00:02:05,140
on again some other shit and their is
also years that

35
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:09,030
for general to you preventive piracy

36
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:12,099
and its ok to use it for

37
00:02:12,099 --> 00:02:15,780
collision avoidance so you can weave
anas

38
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:19,890
he it's possible to set the root try to
ship to make sure that a sheep placenta

39
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:21,459
router does not

40
00:02:21,459 --> 00:02:24,989
crash again some other shit he's using
the search and rescue operation

41
00:02:24,989 --> 00:02:28,220
18 accident investigation

42
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:31,550
and and and more

43
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:35,050
so a/s has been to read used and

44
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:38,970
as a mandatory installation in 2002

45
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:43,500
and let alone in 2006 has been extended
to

46
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:47,940
all by liberation and ships with the
cost on edge of

47
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:51,720
300 and all passenger she forgot your
bedside

48
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:55,890
means that nowadays that on an estimate
number

49
00:02:55,890 --> 00:02:59,720
on roughly 400,000 in his leash on

50
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:03,269
worldwide and expect it to be over the
media and in the near future

51
00:03:03,269 --> 00:03:06,510
so that's in the man YouTube

52
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:11,739
of on the a problem to get an idea

53
00:03:11,739 --> 00:03:18,030
as: and be architecturally ass is
Bethany cene be

54
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:22,220
in the picture so busy keez can see
Ventana

55
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:25,739
ships that took a child not getting a
frequency

56
00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:29,750
and and also told we have there metonomy
Italy's it we

57
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:35,049
what is called add to the big issue on
subway said he used that to you

58
00:03:35,049 --> 00:03:38,129
and instruct the sheep on

59
00:03:38,129 --> 00:03:43,030
not to condition Odyssey on if not
problems at the moment it's on the side

60
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:47,500
really at simplification so all the ship
they took each other to be a VHF

61
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:50,700
and on top of that

62
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:55,090
they also talked we've as: get me so
these get with a collect

63
00:03:55,090 --> 00:03:59,049
as: information on and upload
information on

64
00:03:59,049 --> 00:04:03,060
up some information over the Internet so
we

65
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:07,069
a yes becomes born their BS to respond
the world's

66
00:04:07,069 --> 00:04:11,019
by having the GPS that to look at. the
ship

67
00:04:11,019 --> 00:04:15,069
a gay and then be information it is
broadcast

68
00:04:15,069 --> 00:04:18,940
to the other sheep and yet by and also
to the Internet eased the position of

69
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:19,530
the sheet

70
00:04:19,530 --> 00:04:24,130
together we ve the some static data on
the Sheba like its name

71
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:27,320
the catechol decide

72
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:31,650
emission at eighty which kind of gutsy
scurrying

73
00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:35,490
present biscayne nuclear got and if you
submit a sheep

74
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:39,280
is a passenger she whatever so in this

75
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:43,220
talk we are going to present two major
trades

76
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:46,350
affecting this technology so want to
read

77
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:50,320
he is related to the implementation side
have a problem

78
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:53,820
and their he's aight correspond to the
guy that is look at the up

79
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:57,050
on the corner up left so we see how we
can basically

80
00:04:57,050 --> 00:05:00,250
attack your software

81
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:04,900
all the as: provider but provide such
data

82
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:09,400
where Internet and then we'll see Allen
attack it can possibly

83
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:16,270
attack get at you frequency ASP protocol
itself

84
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:19,820
so is a sad

85
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:22,979
as: messages at exchange in two
different forms

86
00:05:22,979 --> 00:05:26,009
method importance for the first four
ease

87
00:05:26,009 --> 00:05:29,710
get ID frequency so that to China

88
00:05:29,710 --> 00:05:33,860
Rafi around and red in 62 me garrett's

89
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:37,759
but that he is for communication between
ships and between ships in port

90
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:39,949
authorities

91
00:05:39,949 --> 00:05:43,470
and then another form skinned message
as: message

92
00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:47,550
ease be up online he s provider

93
00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:51,259
to one example provider ease but in
traffic

94
00:05:51,259 --> 00:05:55,340
service provider for example we collect
information on chips for the title Katie

95
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:57,210
the at the moment

96
00:05:57,210 --> 00:06:00,669
not riney in the port of Singapore

97
00:06:00,669 --> 00:06:04,789
DC have different callers because for
the friendships

98
00:06:04,789 --> 00:06:08,600
the other position we worship center
located you have information on how many

99
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,160
Besser said a ride

100
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:13,620
bad day I mean a better than ever board

101
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:17,729
and and so on and so far so 09 is
provider baby

102
00:06:17,729 --> 00:06:22,350
big big spacey be collected from a shady
ass information a process them

103
00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:25,729
and then if they provide this
information on it but for free

104
00:06:25,729 --> 00:06:29,180
or a from gonna buy

105
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:32,560
baby get their permission they provide
them to

106
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:36,009
two different parties per sempre B side
is free

107
00:06:36,009 --> 00:06:39,490
so you can easily access this identity
information:

108
00:06:39,490 --> 00:06:43,550
other provider may provide information
to port authorities are two species are

109
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:50,550
to special customers for the friend
needs

110
00:06:52,330 --> 00:06:56,110
so over the data collected by the song
9as provider

111
00:06:56,110 --> 00:07:00,169
that different way over up steam today
that will provide air

112
00:07:00,169 --> 00:07:03,229
song one ways to use my mind up

113
00:07:03,229 --> 00:07:06,660
so if you have the ER shipp and you want
to

114
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:10,190
up steam beat up sitting position to be
a sheep so communicated usually asleep

115
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:11,229
you can use ima by

116
00:07:11,229 --> 00:07:14,300
up if you have a 3G connectivity

117
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:18,110
you can use some some software

118
00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:21,120
you can do to you can use he needs

119
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:25,000
to economically San Fran be made to the
suit will be heir to the line provided a

120
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,220
week process them

121
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:29,819
you can use it at your API to delete but
the most

122
00:07:29,819 --> 00:07:32,940
use their Antti to you for providing

123
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:36,630
to collect as: information ease by using
get weak

124
00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:41,410
to that obese gateway but I'd like to
wear snaking tech sample issue before

125
00:07:41,410 --> 00:07:45,870
sonic peace this one that a beast now
wheres better deployed originally

126
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:50,410
on the cost and make may be securely
send far

127
00:07:50,410 --> 00:07:53,639
radio frequency data

128
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:58,139
and a upstream them to the cloud

129
00:07:58,139 --> 00:08:01,190
okay so that the week at a cop on as:

130
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:06,050
cell if you are more detai at point you
to the pertinent to my presentation at

131
00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:09,330
thinking about or you can even to me

132
00:08:09,330 --> 00:08:12,349
if you go to the PDF it is a front-page
describe how it works

133
00:08:12,349 --> 00:08:15,370
so now we want to focus on Detroit's
because

134
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:19,770
UN Security Conference so we want to see
when I have a problem here

135
00:08:19,770 --> 00:08:23,849
to that to me jar and to macro

136
00:08:23,849 --> 00:08:27,229
categories a problem to the first one

137
00:08:27,229 --> 00:08:31,810
easy is rated to implement these
implementations specie fixable

138
00:08:31,810 --> 00:08:36,130
our problem that only call soon be
online providers

139
00:08:36,130 --> 00:08:39,240
so that's nothing to do leave their with
a with a

140
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:43,810
with them we've had a frequency on with
the protocol it's at about his only

141
00:08:43,810 --> 00:08:47,480
and implementation problem the provider
and

142
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:51,110
eats eases threat is a group of tread

143
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:55,920
batting my keys eats Man of Steel CPR as
the second type of threats

144
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:59,880
so the second category of threats
practical specific

145
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:04,519
which means that it is a problem into
specification obas protocol

146
00:09:04,519 --> 00:09:07,880
and their see if it is a problem they
are all the

147
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:11,420
ANS to respond at like nobody but that

148
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:14,500
more than 400 towers and

149
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:17,769
their problems and a profit beast typeof

150
00:09:17,769 --> 00:09:21,300
problems are not easy to be fixed
because to fix a problem in to respond

151
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:22,260
that would mean to a

152
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:26,250
updated transponder up David Sheehan
when it was born that

153
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:29,519
and is not easy when you need to respond
instead on a ship without into clinic de

154
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:31,339
tienda

155
00:09:31,339 --> 00:09:34,700
is not like updating the freemen my
iPhone right but again dodi from the

156
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:35,330
internet

157
00:09:35,330 --> 00:09:38,760
bad okay

158
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:43,080
so now let's that's a bit toll can give
a we give a brain disease

159
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:46,339
bout image format

160
00:09:46,339 --> 00:09:49,870
as: messages at exchanges so the use a
former colony

161
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:54,360
ATI BDM and then on messaging message
type

162
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:57,720
for different information with an
exchange among ships

163
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:01,250
for example nada message used

164
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:05,310
to you trip or a position over she put
latitude/longitude

165
00:10:05,310 --> 00:10:09,680
the curse the speed but not message for
thirty years to exchange if

166
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:13,390
start the information on their static
what a good starting from a shot like

167
00:10:13,390 --> 00:10:15,269
the movie sheep

168
00:10:15,269 --> 00:10:18,810
account re which kind as Italy for his
kind of God today at

169
00:10:18,810 --> 00:10:22,579
is a is is that he's carrying

170
00:10:22,579 --> 00:10:28,670
and so on benefit on other message but I
to surf report or to Port Authority is

171
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:32,630
saw a este esta responder not many Adam
not allowed

172
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:36,160
to does meet such message and unable to
receive them

173
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:40,700
Mb said men each menus for management by
bus and then but I love it

174
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:44,040
passivity related their message

175
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:48,769
so what would be the freest were lost to
tonight is more to it than that

176
00:10:48,769 --> 00:10:52,529
allies to you and generates such

177
00:10:52,529 --> 00:10:56,570
the payload for such messages

178
00:10:56,570 --> 00:11:01,750
okay so we've east to let and it's
basically an incall dad so we can

179
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:06,420
we can generate any kind all as:
messages

180
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:10,750
and then we'd use the school to

181
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:14,279
performer docs better she laid out serb
of

182
00:11:14,279 --> 00:11:18,519
the implementation side attack embossed
the the protocol

183
00:11:18,519 --> 00:11:22,290
at specific attacks 26 ampal

184
00:11:22,290 --> 00:11:25,540
for example you can see bat we can
generate to pay it off

185
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:31,070
bottom by a reform any ASCII form fought
and died in Shi'ite

186
00:11:31,070 --> 00:11:34,459
that these involved in military
operation

187
00:11:34,459 --> 00:11:39,060
and their you can see that he's Italian
be kids ever sheep as nm

188
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:42,990
what's called MMS hi is a lie came
equivalent

189
00:11:42,990 --> 00:11:47,550
all the Ave played a bit yet when your
car

190
00:11:47,550 --> 00:11:51,540
case each review when your cat is a
plate with an ideal okay sheep at the

191
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:52,800
same

192
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:56,589
and that vid free first DG RVs

193
00:11:56,589 --> 00:12:01,180
hair idea he's correspond to the country

194
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:04,550
van if activities meat-eater is BK is

195
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:08,480
in peace message type it in less than 24

196
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:12,019
the vessel type 35 it niece meter

197
00:12:12,019 --> 00:12:16,589
so of course I'm not going to be paid
yet but he's a wall including all

198
00:12:16,589 --> 00:12:20,240
and fortify the sheep type and so on and
so forth

199
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:24,209
sup

200
00:12:24,209 --> 00:12:28,639
suffer setback we see I'm going to beat
we come first attack BK is

201
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:31,800
have anything to use them pain Taubert
black

202
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:34,910
to give you an idea of a starting point
to the

203
00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:39,070
the the first the talkies abuse software

204
00:12:39,070 --> 00:12:42,459
and the spectacle seized in a BTTF when
a bad guy

205
00:12:42,459 --> 00:12:46,329
to spoof

206
00:12:46,329 --> 00:12:50,720
shapes on ed to navigate shown 229
provider

207
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:53,829
soviet so they attack sabes pretty easy
sell

208
00:12:53,829 --> 00:12:57,230
you have your computer you can craft

209
00:12:57,230 --> 00:13:01,170
any BDM back at by easing that too would

210
00:13:01,170 --> 00:13:04,190
I E a show you before the a bbm included

211
00:13:04,190 --> 00:13:08,579
tool for example in this case we are
crafting a fake shit but is moving at

212
00:13:08,579 --> 00:13:09,079
five

213
00:13:09,079 --> 00:13:12,750
the two notes ethnic Latitude minus
ninety seeks an

214
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:17,019
lodged in my 290 she's alleged fraud to
and we are using netcat

215
00:13:17,019 --> 00:13:21,130
we add upstream to defer to the provider

216
00:13:21,130 --> 00:13:26,660
so with in peak with this weekend we can
for example what he can do

217
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:32,079
weekend for example fake a US shi'ite

218
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:36,490
such as for example me to ship back tees
movie now from the

219
00:13:36,490 --> 00:13:40,660
but I Pacific Ocean on leaa to you

220
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:46,110
North Korea

221
00:13:46,110 --> 00:13:50,410
we can also program in militias truth so
we can years there

222
00:13:50,410 --> 00:13:53,980
Goo Gone and a came out Ryan

223
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:57,139
as simple it and we can say Acadiana

224
00:13:57,139 --> 00:14:01,149
I want to fake a ship it is moving
across the me to Regency

225
00:14:01,149 --> 00:14:04,230
spelling bold word Ian

226
00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:09,529
he to end our time so the sheep will
basically moving out in spending to work

227
00:14:09,529 --> 00:14:12,680
is like a game bat F the sky

228
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:16,010
peace beast online provider

229
00:14:16,010 --> 00:14:19,880
bettys marine traffic he shared a tweet
all the other Provider

230
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:25,300
so what's your if you can inject fake
information patio too busy Kelly

231
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:29,350
an injecting this information all that
appear

232
00:14:29,350 --> 00:14:33,370
governor provider because with a
exchange and he's pretty CVR because

233
00:14:33,370 --> 00:14:34,660
such data

234
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:38,000
I used by Port Authority's to control

235
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,449
and ships very used that but I E

236
00:14:42,449 --> 00:14:46,180
by many parties for temple 11 up in
maine use is to the back

237
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:49,779
sheaves a bet they're Spieler only

238
00:14:49,779 --> 00:14:53,690
illegally in a pissy of Sheba to use air

239
00:14:53,690 --> 00:14:57,449
some cheap well fuel to you

240
00:14:57,449 --> 00:15:01,360
to operate by that that my people you'd

241
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:05,149
actually now studying then we'll where
an issue that

242
00:15:05,149 --> 00:15:08,839
a lot of sheep own.st use few I'll that
he is a

243
00:15:08,839 --> 00:15:13,370
cheaper but valued to what they do these
company they correlate

244
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:16,430
a ass information on we've satellite

245
00:15:16,430 --> 00:15:20,550
photo and they can see they can see if
it eases XIV it easy to become a

246
00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:23,810
sandwich she pees Beaulieu teen girl she
be spilling I N

247
00:15:23,810 --> 00:15:28,260
on Wii sheep made bad things by correct
information so if you can

248
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:33,550
change a fake as: information to gratify
provide their you can blame on someone

249
00:15:33,550 --> 00:15:36,690
else

250
00:15:36,690 --> 00:15:40,149
so in the second attack we are not arnie

251
00:15:40,149 --> 00:15:43,839
injecting false information internet
what about to initially modify next

252
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:45,810
easing information

253
00:15:45,810 --> 00:15:50,680
took effect can be operating in
different ways

254
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:55,040
became do you can be done a complete
even for the remote

255
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:59,730
byee I sending to the provider

256
00:15:59,730 --> 00:16:03,620
updating for updated for an existing
chips

257
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:07,240
and they're basically if we do it that
fast a rate

258
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:10,410
better to wait a minute our target

259
00:16:10,410 --> 00:16:14,240
we are able to override information
sheeps so we can pick up a nexus the

260
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,060
sheep in change their position on

261
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:20,320
change his position on or change if the
type of the sheep

262
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:23,380
or changing the name of the sheep and so
on we can also do it

263
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:27,660
buying as it is eating example by
setting got there ok get to be

264
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:31,540
so for example p.m. but added we are
near to the port

265
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:34,970
so what we can do weekend at this

266
00:16:34,970 --> 00:16:38,880
what im going to you can buy one of
these dumb call that cost twenty twenty

267
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:41,829
dollar Smith that it's going to be a
speakeasy

268
00:16:41,829 --> 00:16:47,610
the end at the stone but normally used
to you received a naked TV or radio

269
00:16:47,610 --> 00:16:51,399
and stream we can plug in the computer

270
00:16:51,399 --> 00:16:54,459
have been as-received her that

271
00:16:54,459 --> 00:16:59,430
demo too late the traffic and then we
can use our computer to receive

272
00:16:59,430 --> 00:17:03,320
as: information broadcast maybe she p.m.
to Singapore out more

273
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:06,890
but what we can do we can I jack

274
00:17:06,890 --> 00:17:09,929
at the the traffic and then we can
upstream

275
00:17:09,929 --> 00:17:14,089
modify the traffic to the provider okay
so it's been is like a rogue

276
00:17:14,089 --> 00:17:17,209
AP K bop me t0

277
00:17:17,209 --> 00:17:20,850
as: get me so

278
00:17:20,850 --> 00:17:23,970
example we have in a good on

279
00:17:23,970 --> 00:17:28,669
which isn't real sheep areas thought
she'd betty's movin

280
00:17:28,669 --> 00:17:33,100
the across the BCP reader and air

281
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:36,210
he did he do you we see I'll

282
00:17:36,210 --> 00:17:39,570
I we add able to you

283
00:17:39,570 --> 00:17:42,730
gotta get the ship and that is

284
00:17:42,730 --> 00:17:46,270
operating along the river and movin

285
00:17:46,270 --> 00:17:49,950
vehicle EV sheep in the middle

286
00:17:49,950 --> 00:17:53,900
lbs in Dallas

287
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:56,980
on Lake on the back of Dallas in

288
00:17:56,980 --> 00:18:00,530
you can see it the provider does not
make any

289
00:18:00,530 --> 00:18:04,169
in a check whatever information bad the
ship is providing

290
00:18:04,169 --> 00:18:07,350
ease easy real fake becas

291
00:18:07,350 --> 00:18:10,870
we cannot ever used to she black and
brought him in the middle of a small

292
00:18:10,870 --> 00:18:12,770
denote making the Gulf

293
00:18:12,770 --> 00:18:19,140
in a golf club in Dallas right

294
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:23,549
okay so p these are threats but I dot
dress teen

295
00:18:23,549 --> 00:18:27,460
for of course obey Allah Bay that
problematic

296
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:30,530
be cares basically

297
00:18:30,530 --> 00:18:34,720
the information are provided by as:
provider

298
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:37,780
they can be easy to pull UT by
cybercriminals

299
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:42,490
so it means bad median or a way to
distinguish between

300
00:18:42,490 --> 00:18:46,600
permission to come true and information
bit might be force

301
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:49,809
on frank so that's one problem but

302
00:18:49,809 --> 00:18:55,500
what I'm going to show you next he's to
me to court but the research

303
00:18:55,500 --> 00:19:00,020
the fact that we taught again at be a
product are detached

304
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:05,260
so we had impersonate the guy bit easy
on the right side of the screen

305
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:08,890
their car care and

306
00:19:08,890 --> 00:19:12,030
him so we are going to

307
00:19:12,030 --> 00:19:18,919
too busy Katie generate such fake
message any standup develop them

308
00:19:18,919 --> 00:19:22,610
to the provider yeah our internet we've
delete

309
00:19:22,610 --> 00:19:28,250
VI BRB radio frequency

310
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:31,289
so be real problem here is that

311
00:19:31,289 --> 00:19:36,950
he asks as be in designing what they
call it had that happen ok

312
00:19:36,950 --> 00:19:42,200
its maybe only ten years ago right
blocked in your single

313
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:45,799
and the staple packs beware murdered de
ficar

314
00:19:45,799 --> 00:19:49,169
to perform in cost expensive

315
00:19:49,169 --> 00:19:52,480
be cares to be able to generate

316
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:56,220
in I do frequency seeking now would have
required a

317
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:59,490
for attack ads to do it United where
most likely

318
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:03,159
there were no easy way of doing it
except buying

319
00:20:03,159 --> 00:20:06,909
beta sophisticated and expensive %uh

320
00:20:06,909 --> 00:20:10,030
instrumentation K so

321
00:20:10,030 --> 00:20:13,929
who designed the protocol December
protocol without any formal with

322
00:20:13,929 --> 00:20:15,370
indication

323
00:20:15,370 --> 00:20:18,860
so there is no way to authenticate the
sender the message

324
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:22,659
and without any for all and I

325
00:20:22,659 --> 00:20:26,679
integrity check it means bad bodies nor

326
00:20:26,679 --> 00:20:31,820
at CRCE Middies no attack bad message
can be easy

327
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:34,929
isn't modified during transmission on
Oct

328
00:20:34,929 --> 00:20:38,090
so what's happened now and 2014

329
00:20:38,090 --> 00:20:43,679
K East steez cool to talk about their
baffin all that flew in for much screen

330
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:47,179
but it's also look to it was a call to
look at

331
00:20:47,179 --> 00:20:51,640
you this kind of threats cares doesn't
14

332
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:55,070
we have 0 can regenerate is seeking out

333
00:20:55,070 --> 00:20:58,740
and I DEF frequency seeking an easy way

334
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:03,640
so down sure is two years what about a
sitter

335
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:09,700
aren't using since couple years eat
coalition logical software defined radio

336
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:13,260
so is a technology that has been a PK
shah

337
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:16,700
and why I'm ease for example to the

338
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:19,980
receive a radio and television
communication is said is it will be

339
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:20,500
before

340
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:24,350
not abuse USB Donald that

341
00:21:24,350 --> 00:21:28,120
for twenty dollar you can you can buy in
to use them

342
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:31,520
and and other application ease pain I do
ima I'm a source

343
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:35,820
so be used is that using a radio link to
communicate with their friends

344
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:39,000
if you can read your the year this often
defined transmitter

345
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:43,870
for doing it and Aguilera obvious of the
final yet he's fat

346
00:21:43,870 --> 00:21:46,960
the air Vic Aust Alba

347
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:51,159
greeting the radio is it used

348
00:21:51,159 --> 00:21:56,140
because he's done via software Mb social
means that the complexity

349
00:21:56,140 --> 00:22:00,080
ease 100 years compared to the physical
radio

350
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:04,320
and %um in greater trick flexibility
because you can see she did your

351
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:06,270
software you can

352
00:22:06,270 --> 00:22:10,429
try different type a free agent David
vowed to add you know because if you can

353
00:22:10,429 --> 00:22:14,210
add any the mistake if too far away we
have it if you can do it again

354
00:22:14,210 --> 00:22:17,980
so it's very cost expansión you unit
their flexibility guess of Teddy's

355
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:21,020
easy you can create a media PC

356
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:25,490
to be technology nowadays is accessible
on by maybe

357
00:22:25,490 --> 00:22:29,679
which means by writing katydid

358
00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:35,110
so that's I want testing lab

359
00:22:35,110 --> 00:22:38,510
so in our testing lab we have miss
computer

360
00:22:38,510 --> 00:22:41,610
which is running DBN we begin a deal

361
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:45,390
get to rate you ease probably the
masterpiece on the softer refinery

362
00:22:45,390 --> 00:22:51,130
your sleazy framework for development of
that when a duplication

363
00:22:51,130 --> 00:22:56,620
and that then we at their is tough to
find a deputy from

364
00:22:56,620 --> 00:23:01,260
which is peace box miss white box on the
right

365
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:05,030
be softer defended to be fed on is
produced by a company called

366
00:23:05,030 --> 00:23:10,270
it was research ended curse to roughly
six hundred dollars

367
00:23:10,270 --> 00:23:14,830
so I don't ever leave me today because
and to pain in the ass too

368
00:23:14,830 --> 00:23:18,090
& Toubro to bring heavy box

369
00:23:18,090 --> 00:23:22,039
we will to keep on reading playing pool
because wedding to on the stage

370
00:23:22,039 --> 00:23:25,980
but to the name alongside on one you
want to bring gonna keep meant and the

371
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:27,690
so we have bet box

372
00:23:27,690 --> 00:23:32,270
this can you can at the box TV computer
USB you the computer to me

373
00:23:32,270 --> 00:23:36,240
to generate básica now be a software

374
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:39,370
and then use it if it all tomb

375
00:23:39,370 --> 00:23:44,240
propagate the Siena 1br is a kind is
like an access point

376
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:49,230
Model S K to Canadia a double that we
have an amplifier your

377
00:23:49,230 --> 00:23:52,299
with to be used to amplify now to put an
Exynos

378
00:23:52,299 --> 00:23:56,120
because so it's tough to find a pity for
is already using another

379
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:59,909
but if you want to to get issue that a
bit these

380
00:23:59,909 --> 00:24:03,400
5-kilometer find away from you you need
an amplified

381
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:07,230
we'd so we both agreed %um what if I
have any York such as

382
00:24:07,230 --> 00:24:11,490
we use videos amplifier and then we had
that game to me don't it is an

383
00:24:11,490 --> 00:24:14,900
NES transponder vets

384
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:19,580
well one of the most use a S transponder
did you know

385
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:22,669
is produced by German company and we use
it

386
00:24:22,669 --> 00:24:26,299
to to past fat

387
00:24:26,299 --> 00:24:30,130
the packet we were generating via radio
where correctly

388
00:24:30,130 --> 00:24:34,110
received by the transponder so we use it
as a team

389
00:24:34,110 --> 00:24:38,500
but the backing basically K

390
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:43,309
courts all okay I'm not going to pay DMV
cares

391
00:24:43,309 --> 00:24:47,529
I don't know what time is it bad at me
she so we have already

392
00:24:47,529 --> 00:24:52,669
billion out an hour cell better the
scheme over tennis meter so the first

393
00:24:52,669 --> 00:24:53,779
thing to be deed

394
00:24:53,779 --> 00:24:56,960
was she develop in a ass

395
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:02,210
cans meter yes software so when first
one to develop such stuff there was no

396
00:25:02,210 --> 00:25:03,830
know where somebody see their

397
00:25:03,830 --> 00:25:07,770
available over the Internet we actually

398
00:25:07,770 --> 00:25:11,250
stumble upon three different receiver
had about 20 or

399
00:25:11,250 --> 00:25:14,820
there was not tells me that so we
develop I what

400
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:19,120
estimates me to use can lead you for
doing it and agreed to provide already

401
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:19,880
some blocks

402
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:23,190
for modem for a moot issue unimpeded
will be seeking I'll

403
00:25:23,190 --> 00:25:26,490
fought for example all featuring I

404
00:25:26,490 --> 00:25:31,570
band featuring and I'm a spam bot if you
think that your clients enough

405
00:25:31,570 --> 00:25:36,270
but it was me seeing to the component
the what bet you will be left

406
00:25:36,270 --> 00:25:41,309
the AAAS what he called 'as a frame be
dead so we develop such component and

407
00:25:41,309 --> 00:25:45,679
in my presentation at having a box I
describe out watching attain

408
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:48,890
to just to be fast that so what we did

409
00:25:48,890 --> 00:25:54,500
we implemented the aass stack which
means that that component taking impute

410
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:58,110
and be paid or do we want to transmit

411
00:25:58,110 --> 00:26:01,400
which she's there Blvd a PDMS each

412
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:05,740
sleep a lot and basically to order a s
stock processing

413
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:09,230
down to lay in one

414
00:26:09,230 --> 00:26:13,470
eke out a black a sequence of at bits

415
00:26:13,470 --> 00:26:18,450
and then finish buyers then what FN DVD
possibly speeds to promote a little bit

416
00:26:18,450 --> 00:26:19,289
misty to him

417
00:26:19,289 --> 00:26:22,950
GMs came with a leash on over to the
friend

418
00:26:22,950 --> 00:26:26,580
China's multiply for to see you know sir
said

419
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:30,159
two different at the glass 25 cue at
imminent risk you know it's

420
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:33,820
and then SN the C you know it will be
you SLP device

421
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:37,990
miss your PC inc. beefed-up so that's
our radio show

422
00:26:37,990 --> 00:26:41,250
PCs this is like a binky

423
00:26:41,250 --> 00:26:45,169
NAS transponder bit cause thousands of
bucks

424
00:26:45,169 --> 00:26:49,669
bad your software

425
00:26:49,669 --> 00:26:53,340
okay so the first the packing going to
show you is

426
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:56,419
called is that I do frequency

427
00:26:56,419 --> 00:26:59,820
spoofing equivalent to the to veteran

428
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:05,190
I show you before he now we've many
traffic

429
00:27:05,190 --> 00:27:08,559
took a top is like following so we have
a computer

430
00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:13,090
a running game and I wanna a estar
neither and that

431
00:27:13,090 --> 00:27:16,929
being connected to and the body for I'll

432
00:27:16,929 --> 00:27:20,429
vats and the season-opening tolerate you

433
00:27:20,429 --> 00:27:23,840
and then we have a target so without get
can be

434
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:27,490
even and the stylish on port

435
00:27:27,490 --> 00:27:30,890
like this when you see here or

436
00:27:30,890 --> 00:27:36,669
a in a estimates border likely to
respond and we both for the experiment

437
00:27:36,669 --> 00:27:41,409
choice a first as a as you can see your

438
00:27:41,409 --> 00:27:45,159
weekend we can generate their

439
00:27:45,159 --> 00:27:49,700
and any kind of as: messege wanna be
your for example these monies affronted

440
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:50,789
SL

441
00:27:50,789 --> 00:27:53,870
called time I chrome at sent a note to
the longitude

442
00:27:53,870 --> 00:27:58,190
says you can see the transponder here is
catching up order ships nearby

443
00:27:58,190 --> 00:28:03,010
so if I E if I E would have come with an
asterisk born that day we def

444
00:28:03,010 --> 00:28:07,760
and he and his mom n you could get up
older she's attending doubt more

445
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:11,880
okay Mb show that in addition to do real
shit

446
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:15,279
he also catch up BC you know that we
fake using I want

447
00:28:15,279 --> 00:28:18,549
weeding out a computer and a

448
00:28:18,549 --> 00:28:22,440
one application is this is that an
attack at can for example

449
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:25,659
created fake police

450
00:28:25,659 --> 00:28:28,820
by he say and fat instruct

451
00:28:28,820 --> 00:28:32,559
existing sheeps into movie ingrained a
national so do we

452
00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:35,809
can be used to say okay look now is a
lot I E

453
00:28:35,809 --> 00:28:39,950
from B section of the sea on my right so
you have to go left

454
00:28:39,950 --> 00:28:44,350
to what I can do is an attacking in Fig
we and establish even to blank

455
00:28:44,350 --> 00:28:49,409
left is to the right say can Bossa being
docked exit the sheep into crashing

456
00:28:49,409 --> 00:28:50,279
against the rocks

457
00:28:50,279 --> 00:28:54,070
except always seem to be all we see in
the next to

458
00:28:54,070 --> 00:28:57,960
so I'd other real example a tux

459
00:28:57,960 --> 00:29:01,200
we could also genetic when we can
generate actually

460
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:05,850
SATs a fake seeking out if in we are in
the proxy meet the proximity means

461
00:29:05,850 --> 00:29:10,690
3250 my desk so he's is this not a big
city because it's a lot

462
00:29:10,690 --> 00:29:15,360
means pretty huge and the effin to
proceed IFP it easier to get to

463
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:16,380
installation

464
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:19,970
wannabes online provider

465
00:29:19,970 --> 00:29:23,470
of course be seen at ease maybe catch up
by the get to be

466
00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:27,799
in will be upstream over the Internet so
we be simple pop we can target

467
00:29:27,799 --> 00:29:31,250
of sheeps and port authorities

468
00:29:31,250 --> 00:29:35,100
and in general I S station but at a
nearby

469
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:39,779
and of online provider because if it is
one of these get a week

470
00:29:39,779 --> 00:29:43,549
as you can see an example if you take a
ship committees moving on the

471
00:29:43,549 --> 00:29:44,649
Mediterranean Sea

472
00:29:44,649 --> 00:29:51,370
out of Genoa port they get to weed
Pakistani port we'll read such

473
00:29:51,370 --> 00:29:55,450
message and upstream to lobbying tonight
so if we in real time if you look over

474
00:29:55,450 --> 00:29:56,760
the Internet

475
00:29:56,760 --> 00:30:01,940
on the provider we see actually I wish
the cheap moving

476
00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:06,820
okay so now started without with aerial
attacks

477
00:30:06,820 --> 00:30:13,820
do you have some question on just sung
it is not clear

478
00:30:14,279 --> 00:30:21,279
s

479
00:30:31,060 --> 00:30:34,600
okay so you're asking me when we i jak
an existing shaper

480
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:38,260
I we block existing information so if
you did your software

481
00:30:38,260 --> 00:30:41,480
you busy Kelly upstream me on a fake
information

482
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:44,970
over and over rapidly and sleep is the
overriding

483
00:30:44,970 --> 00:30:48,750
if you do to get I do frequency you have
an amplifier

484
00:30:48,750 --> 00:30:51,800
so if you if you're not a money

485
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:58,370
as: who work at 12 adult 5 Oct I want
amplify what a cab to a feed furtive apt

486
00:30:58,370 --> 00:31:00,870
safe for use in higher power

487
00:31:00,870 --> 00:31:04,450
when we come after the scene I love ya
and I do frequency

488
00:31:04,450 --> 00:31:07,750
blue basically override existing

489
00:31:07,750 --> 00:31:14,440
a cb6 embody 30 it differs attack is
caught many were spoofing cyl

490
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:18,280
in in the marine industry that is
something I spent 30 years

491
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:22,300
to look aid is survivor in DC K

492
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:26,700
it to be tonight equivalent I'll be able
to see them use tool for other large

493
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:30,020
look it to survive on undeniable urge so
these are

494
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:33,200
what is called a basically meet a
distress beacon

495
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:38,060
okay antifreeze a sheep nearby better
receives BC says begun

496
00:31:38,060 --> 00:31:42,130
the sheep should automatically generate
an undead okay

497
00:31:42,130 --> 00:31:46,520
by specification and a sheep is required
to go when rescued a survivor

498
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:49,540
okay and their

499
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:53,610
in this attack we are able to generate
Satch to speak such

500
00:31:53,610 --> 00:31:56,670
SOS message to you

501
00:31:56,670 --> 00:32:02,350
for XM pollitt retire at we my generate
peace fake messy to live the king bass L

502
00:32:02,350 --> 00:32:05,950
internet big 18 two-way a

503
00:32:05,950 --> 00:32:11,050
species she space between control
because if you generated if a school for

504
00:32:11,050 --> 00:32:13,550
messages for example here

505
00:32:13,550 --> 00:32:17,910
for a phony many new water committees
just here in leadership nearby

506
00:32:17,910 --> 00:32:21,110
we can do to be a sheep into moving can
gain

507
00:32:21,110 --> 00:32:26,350
two hours and rescue I want big survivor
so in the example we see your

508
00:32:26,350 --> 00:32:29,570
we have top right corner

509
00:32:29,570 --> 00:32:34,470
its attack Ecclesall your number right

510
00:32:34,470 --> 00:32:38,090
on the top better back Ecclesall okay so
he's very

511
00:32:38,090 --> 00:32:42,060
is basically attack in with his computer
that is generating Commission's code

512
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:45,070
your number let you know we have a TV
team okay

513
00:32:45,070 --> 00:32:50,550
so this one is a transponder me to you
we have in our do but to use as a victim

514
00:32:50,550 --> 00:32:54,560
and that the alarm bottom these are not
on

515
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:57,760
and their a quizzical I'm connected with
transponder

516
00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:02,720
and the Sun is a call Saul Ave
transponders with us ponder is connected

517
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:03,700
via USB

518
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:07,440
to a laptop okay is the ease in an
automatic

519
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:12,270
and she be stylish on Inc this is what
the cap can't see basically

520
00:33:12,270 --> 00:33:15,350
it was born there appear to respond
articles on

521
00:33:15,350 --> 00:33:18,430
to make sample you see here

522
00:33:18,430 --> 00:33:22,800
because he owl the attack and at
generate

523
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:27,890
using our software defined radio

524
00:33:27,890 --> 00:33:30,910
in SMS alert and now the alert

525
00:33:30,910 --> 00:33:34,620
trigger bacon Dijon on the transponder

526
00:33:34,620 --> 00:33:37,650
you can see all the transponder parse

527
00:33:37,650 --> 00:33:43,390
information as is almost okay so in the
second attack

528
00:33:43,390 --> 00:33:48,470
it's what a cold now said his past blast
because in answer is against multiple

529
00:33:48,470 --> 00:33:49,840
targets or your

530
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:54,170
VIP at is dat get back it is going

531
00:33:54,170 --> 00:33:57,680
to impersonate Port Authority

532
00:33:57,680 --> 00:34:02,760
in to use one of these control messege
and wannabes control message

533
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:06,490
and now to instructed to respond at

534
00:34:06,490 --> 00:34:11,770
she's reached loan default frequency and
it would be for a s work on and 80s to

535
00:34:11,770 --> 00:34:12,450
mid north

536
00:34:12,450 --> 00:34:15,920
so to respond a

537
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:21,020
the Port Authority can in stock mix East
little spoon that into port

538
00:34:21,020 --> 00:34:24,270
to reach to operate on a different
requests year this point

539
00:34:24,270 --> 00:34:27,550
if you do such bad if you'd like that we
can basically

540
00:34:27,550 --> 00:34:30,910
isolate so we can isolate the shape and
we can

541
00:34:30,910 --> 00:34:34,000
for SpaceShipTwo use in if wrong
frequency

542
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:40,739
and what's more interesting weekend
program it what's called desired target

543
00:34:40,740 --> 00:34:44,050
region so we can a busy can you can say
to sheep okay

544
00:34:44,050 --> 00:34:49,010
you're going to reach frequency not now
but when you entertain Sooners turn

545
00:34:49,010 --> 00:34:53,700
you near in a certain region for example
I can say okay do you know when you're

546
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:55,820
going to enter it region a QB

547
00:34:55,820 --> 00:34:59,350
and he had in seeing somalia which is
known to be

548
00:34:59,350 --> 00:35:02,910
to be their sure if par at

549
00:35:02,910 --> 00:35:06,110
you're going to operate out all

550
00:35:06,110 --> 00:35:11,420
down to CT to me guess with these point
when the sheep arriving bit regional

551
00:35:11,420 --> 00:35:13,390
issues peace

552
00:35:13,390 --> 00:35:16,640
ease ASA radar we basically stopped

553
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:21,660
operating so bad at it the she basically
we disappeared from the monitor

554
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:25,830
of of yep up sheeple our own

555
00:35:25,830 --> 00:35:29,270
the Port Authority bettys controlling
issue

556
00:35:29,270 --> 00:35:32,440
CNN's the scenic sample as before so
we'll

557
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:37,130
first sure that the transponder walks

558
00:35:37,130 --> 00:35:40,560
correctly BKS we send the mean eso es en
route

559
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:45,680
emmett was born there iraq saying okay
that he saw me Missy

560
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:49,350
we then pretend to be a bad guy and we
send

561
00:35:49,350 --> 00:35:52,990
me strategy receive their to descend on
another China

562
00:35:52,990 --> 00:35:56,550
saw I know if you can see here but I'm
sailing

563
00:35:56,550 --> 00:35:59,590
okay do you know you're going to operate
on a different channel

564
00:35:59,590 --> 00:36:05,370
not to be not an official an and what
will happen is that BBC that a real

565
00:36:05,370 --> 00:36:10,310
wean called FEMA to message is issued
but little honey

566
00:36:10,310 --> 00:36:14,540
you want react when SOS un do it again

567
00:36:14,540 --> 00:36:19,070
so we show our weekend basically good
enough

568
00:36:19,070 --> 00:36:23,310
it transponder so make me feel bigger
she been busy bar

569
00:36:23,310 --> 00:36:26,540
from riders okay

570
00:36:26,540 --> 00:36:30,230
it's like to learn of the ecosystem will
the Malaysian flight that crashed last

571
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:30,730
week

572
00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:35,970
right so pretty much

573
00:36:35,970 --> 00:36:40,210
okay refer to attack is called CPR
alerting so very easy

574
00:36:40,210 --> 00:36:43,890
very same Kendall out a pile of
technology that these

575
00:36:43,890 --> 00:36:47,050
implemented on muster the best says
worldwide

576
00:36:47,050 --> 00:36:50,530
and is called CPA closest point of
approach

577
00:36:50,530 --> 00:36:54,500
too busy Karim all shapes having gay in
as:

578
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:58,100
transport have a calculate better
position on

579
00:36:58,100 --> 00:37:03,170
automatically with nearby ships and if
it is one of the nearby XIV it is to

580
00:37:03,170 --> 00:37:04,260
your

581
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:08,350
matisse that kind of coming in possible
leading

582
00:37:08,350 --> 00:37:12,710
we ve with my ship the passport to me
react in different way

583
00:37:12,710 --> 00:37:16,900
it okay wanna be space for example to
generate meert

584
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:20,530
or even to 3 Gervais sheep

585
00:37:20,530 --> 00:37:24,390
into movie out of course to avoid a
collision

586
00:37:24,390 --> 00:37:29,480
of course what we can do is banned gay
weekend generate

587
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:33,460
if each ship

588
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:37,130
metal would be team okay so we can

589
00:37:37,130 --> 00:37:41,750
week engineered a pic be %ah get it.
secrecy

590
00:37:41,750 --> 00:37:45,860
if a cheap bettys Co leading with the
team

591
00:37:45,860 --> 00:37:50,140
such as victim can possibly go out of
track

592
00:37:50,140 --> 00:37:53,950
and Khalid against against iraq

593
00:37:53,950 --> 00:37:57,290
so we constructed position report for
the sour

594
00:37:57,290 --> 00:38:02,840
moving at a hundred to notice at the
longitude and latitude

595
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:06,470
with us at the MSCI call sign in the
south

596
00:38:06,470 --> 00:38:10,100
and I would be outtake slpn close to the
target

597
00:38:10,100 --> 00:38:15,839
victim K what to do next week out that
the curse obese figure this out

598
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:19,120
such as redpoint team

599
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:26,120
dollar target

600
00:38:26,380 --> 00:38:29,460
so what will happen I what I can be
triggered a nerd

601
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:32,490
is committing equally Janine 2sec aren't

602
00:38:32,490 --> 00:38:36,070
and 3-meter week

603
00:38:36,070 --> 00:38:40,300
so I remember Vic what you see on the
left he is v

604
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:44,720
is a call saw that the captain asked
unease ship

605
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:48,470
and better transport that with the
trigger period

606
00:38:48,470 --> 00:38:51,530
and he's not a joke saw I could easily
do

607
00:38:51,530 --> 00:38:55,230
from my room here Medina base and

608
00:38:55,230 --> 00:38:58,820
down to the high bar because I do fieger
see nope is he

609
00:38:58,820 --> 00:39:02,110
Evie it again around up to

610
00:39:02,110 --> 00:39:05,230
3050 mites in doubt about it just yet

611
00:39:05,230 --> 00:39:09,190
BB to myself five miles so

612
00:39:09,190 --> 00:39:12,340
speed disappear of course I can even

613
00:39:12,340 --> 00:39:17,110
broadcast about that but nations
information such as a weather forecast

614
00:39:17,110 --> 00:39:20,660
there is a special message time it is
missus type number 8

615
00:39:20,660 --> 00:39:23,720
it is called binary better is used to

616
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:27,220
broadcast genetic information one uses a
follow-up

617
00:39:27,220 --> 00:39:31,160
weather forecasting say can be set next
to be

618
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:35,890
seaside antifreeze storm it is suspected
kami nick is he okay do you know it's

619
00:39:35,890 --> 00:39:37,800
going to be sunny tomorrow

620
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:44,800
go and surfing JVC guys

621
00:39:45,090 --> 00:39:51,310
okay so we still have 20 minutes and
their

622
00:39:51,310 --> 00:39:55,980
so what issue nao out I'm

623
00:39:55,980 --> 00:39:59,750
he said manage some quite interesting
attacks

624
00:39:59,750 --> 00:40:04,370
what's going on is even more savior so

625
00:40:04,370 --> 00:40:07,590
to be said that his new has never been a
release before it is called

626
00:40:07,590 --> 00:40:11,560
equity slot snobbish on

627
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:14,640
and their miss a fat kid call ceased the

628
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:18,470
are them impersonating the Port
Authority

629
00:40:18,470 --> 00:40:23,600
to me disabled the as: functionality
evolve

630
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:27,009
all the air station on your bike

631
00:40:27,010 --> 00:40:30,850
including shapes and its navigation on

632
00:40:30,850 --> 00:40:34,590
and craft involve the Heene assert an S
corporation

633
00:40:34,590 --> 00:40:39,470
I didn't tell you these by specific
issue on or the aircraft but I'm plugin

634
00:40:39,470 --> 00:40:42,480
search and rescue operation on seaside

635
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:46,260
they compose one but I'd currently using
to locate the

636
00:40:46,260 --> 00:40:50,480
the Malaysian flight they air they add a
key play at

637
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:54,120
me requested to you have Iniesta spawned
at

638
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:58,330
snout okay to broadcast position on the
on the plane

639
00:40:58,330 --> 00:41:03,020
and also to locate possible survivor in
this year's on

640
00:41:03,020 --> 00:41:07,250
of course this kind of and craft man not
affected by

641
00:41:07,250 --> 00:41:10,410
the same problem so be set to keep

642
00:41:10,410 --> 00:41:14,000
said he called is not set to be shot so
what we do

643
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:19,290
we first impersonated be the station so
the base station ease im

644
00:41:19,290 --> 00:41:22,480
usually the FBI you or even gabor

645
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:25,860
on on cost line so cannot be space
station

646
00:41:25,860 --> 00:41:29,580
meant to be reused to organize

647
00:41:29,580 --> 00:41:34,260
the mmm as: communication

648
00:41:34,260 --> 00:41:37,960
i know i mean if you are expert back as:
is a protocol

649
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:42,230
that using access scheme it scored a TD
any

650
00:41:42,230 --> 00:41:46,330
so you cannot and party symbol of Penn
Station on the use a round-robin

651
00:41:46,330 --> 00:41:49,730
seas tan suffer station plus meet

652
00:41:49,730 --> 00:41:54,190
first mcpherson of matisse 27 X mi seh
consul first not

653
00:41:54,190 --> 00:41:58,460
seconds in art for those not there's not
invent the cycle again

654
00:41:58,460 --> 00:42:02,100
okay be used the scandal accesskey not
be kiddie

655
00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:05,860
all use the same frequency so we can get
people together

656
00:42:05,860 --> 00:42:10,260
so we use the surround Robbie systemic a
is like at the process

657
00:42:10,260 --> 00:42:13,340
is live in on a computer yet the a

658
00:42:13,340 --> 00:42:16,590
ask least process not only him process
least

659
00:42:16,590 --> 00:42:21,060
and you want to run with people process
me now a days in a computer

660
00:42:21,060 --> 00:42:24,390
ceaser dos I'm with the processing sees
them solely

661
00:42:24,390 --> 00:42:28,930
you can on which will process the same
time the use essentially the same

662
00:42:28,930 --> 00:42:35,120
their approach so made his peace based a
shot back organize the time to be shown

663
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:40,010
will be different station so what we can
do

664
00:42:40,010 --> 00:42:43,920
weekend shakes that's based dish on

665
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:49,850
and shake coming quickly called into a
messy did pat

666
00:42:49,850 --> 00:42:53,620
in which we see okay Dino I'm going

667
00:42:53,620 --> 00:42:57,150
as base station to book the next

668
00:42:57,150 --> 00:43:01,500
for TDMA slot including is not in the
temperance meeting

669
00:43:01,500 --> 00:43:05,480
same going to Brooklyn next there
hundred milliseconds

670
00:43:05,480 --> 00:43:09,930
so if they do we take an in the can
again every 100 me the sack on

671
00:43:09,930 --> 00:43:14,010
what will happen is dat me SBM years a
feat beastie shown

672
00:43:14,010 --> 00:43:17,440
I we'd be booking all the TDMA slot

673
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:22,540
so at that time sees the base station is
a higher priority compared to two

674
00:43:22,540 --> 00:43:26,790
Norma asst shown BST Sean

675
00:43:26,790 --> 00:43:30,850
want us to meet a longer

676
00:43:30,850 --> 00:43:34,850
basically I'm going to you and

677
00:43:34,850 --> 00:43:39,340
what they called slot Mike least lott's
ambition because I'm going to

678
00:43:39,340 --> 00:43:42,910
to started to book all this luxe

679
00:43:42,910 --> 00:43:46,480
to prevent all this dish on two teams
meet

680
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:49,840
bets big reelection and balls so if we
do it

681
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:53,090
on our transponder better pic also on

682
00:43:53,090 --> 00:43:56,920
about transponder okay so what will
happen is that bitterness ponder we

683
00:43:56,920 --> 00:43:58,570
poppin word mean

684
00:43:58,570 --> 00:44:01,930
of as: transmission timeout

685
00:44:01,930 --> 00:44:06,540
and the bright side you can see that the
last trust me Sean

686
00:44:06,540 --> 00:44:10,920
you can see your the last but as me Sean
far a position report

687
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:14,290
is seven minutes 54 seconds ago

688
00:44:14,290 --> 00:44:18,720
and blasted a National Forest a big data
like the Danish on Ovi

689
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:25,720
sheep been a movie she piss on is seeks
me noted 52 seconds

690
00:44:25,870 --> 00:44:30,650
so peace again if they do we face and
the simple messy to the United frequency

691
00:44:30,650 --> 00:44:31,620
from the

692
00:44:31,620 --> 00:44:36,240
from the pan he added down 2.1 all the
sheep they added a we stopped

693
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:40,920
broadcasting their body shot so we
basically shut down all the ASE stem

694
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:44,020
here K

695
00:44:44,020 --> 00:44:47,580
Lisa tax code timing attack miso soup
but

696
00:44:47,580 --> 00:44:53,830
similar to the previous one this use in
our compliments Egypt that

697
00:44:53,830 --> 00:44:57,460
and we design via and

698
00:44:57,460 --> 00:45:01,390
VM the protocol think that was useful
tool to other

699
00:45:01,390 --> 00:45:06,220
so is a condom message fair pair and

700
00:45:06,220 --> 00:45:10,960
can be used to use tonight it past
border two dates this mission in time

701
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:15,190
so I feel bad when going to use such
products such message it was because it

702
00:45:15,190 --> 00:45:16,460
may be a tunnel

703
00:45:16,460 --> 00:45:19,840
I'm thinking maybe have to mean yet
she'd seen be the board

704
00:45:19,840 --> 00:45:23,250
so you won't you don't want them to
dance meet and the

705
00:45:23,250 --> 00:45:26,300
and a sec on C 12 today that it must be
shown because they have to mean either

706
00:45:26,300 --> 00:45:29,070
way there is too much traffic

707
00:45:29,070 --> 00:45:33,260
I don't know saw the fourth broadcast
time he's a six-minute first that you

708
00:45:33,260 --> 00:45:33,890
report

709
00:45:33,890 --> 00:45:39,270
NZ lecomba 5 up to three minutes to the
time to report the penny from speed

710
00:45:39,270 --> 00:45:43,020
by using bet that called you can see
your

711
00:45:43,020 --> 00:45:46,430
you can basically if you to rate over 15
minutes just say okay to know you're

712
00:45:46,430 --> 00:45:47,500
going to delay a

713
00:45:47,500 --> 00:45:51,390
I want you to the day because mission to
50 minutes and then you do it again

714
00:45:51,390 --> 00:45:55,290
and again sorry but I'm the transponder
want us to meet

715
00:45:55,290 --> 00:45:58,560
you no longer so it's actually

716
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:01,900
the effect is BC miss veteran bet on you
so

717
00:46:01,900 --> 00:46:04,940
usual before

718
00:46:04,940 --> 00:46:08,680
of course you can even do the opposite
so you can even say to be

719
00:46:08,680 --> 00:46:11,690
to it juvenile splendor

720
00:46:11,690 --> 00:46:16,120
to increase made frequency

721
00:46:16,120 --> 00:46:20,260
so instead of leg you sending get
starting apart every six minutes like a

722
00:46:20,260 --> 00:46:22,510
circus and respect apart every

723
00:46:22,510 --> 00:46:26,580
lemme Nick 32nd one second

724
00:46:26,580 --> 00:46:30,470
so what's happened if I ever came to add
more than a maybe and red

725
00:46:30,470 --> 00:46:33,780
and transponder under ships and I okay
you

726
00:46:33,780 --> 00:46:39,060
all you have to send the report every
one second this game going to Florida

727
00:46:39,060 --> 00:46:42,380
me the Port Authority's you know

728
00:46:42,380 --> 00:46:46,690
will be boom

729
00:46:46,690 --> 00:46:50,640
okay so better not attack this is very
different from the previous one

730
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:55,640
really be Sunnis in is to me beast when
we needed to should be a problem in the

731
00:46:55,640 --> 00:46:57,150
future

732
00:46:57,150 --> 00:47:01,260
so the ADA's bat as: message exchanges
get it. frequency

733
00:47:01,260 --> 00:47:05,930
okay said before between sheep two sheep
between sheep to police between police

734
00:47:05,930 --> 00:47:06,620
to

735
00:47:06,620 --> 00:47:09,650
and craft between the sheets to Port
Authority's

736
00:47:09,650 --> 00:47:13,290
and whatever and man exchange

737
00:47:13,290 --> 00:47:16,690
and then it in the back and then often
processed

738
00:47:16,690 --> 00:47:20,810
usually Port Authority's be at the back
and see stand that they

739
00:47:20,810 --> 00:47:25,530
we take a lead this message bipartisan a
mess heat

740
00:47:25,530 --> 00:47:29,340
in band the a bust or a condo the
message in a database

741
00:47:29,340 --> 00:47:32,750
on they used to two different affix

742
00:47:32,750 --> 00:47:36,220
okay so I'll what about if you use a SSR
talkback

743
00:47:36,220 --> 00:47:41,030
gonna to Diddy very malicious payload

744
00:47:41,030 --> 00:47:44,730
such as became we may be able to get a
buffer overflow

745
00:47:44,730 --> 00:47:50,080
or a secret injection in the database
the Eliza sadly the same basis

746
00:47:50,080 --> 00:47:53,960
very for example weather forecast he is
a message diabetes

747
00:47:53,960 --> 00:47:57,790
genetic so you can basically

748
00:47:57,790 --> 00:48:00,870
in Typee 10 his mess you can

749
00:48:00,870 --> 00:48:05,780
he said any kind of the they want and
this message will be developed to be

750
00:48:05,780 --> 00:48:09,450
with us born there because point we are
striving a messege bottom message would

751
00:48:09,450 --> 00:48:11,120
be can see them because he's a we do

752
00:48:11,120 --> 00:48:15,280
some pic so when it

753
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:18,880
let example

754
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:23,250
he's man I to use weather forecast
message

755
00:48:23,250 --> 00:48:26,380
to this message are the

756
00:48:26,380 --> 00:48:30,950
processed by became softer like this
when you see your bitch is a softer to

757
00:48:30,950 --> 00:48:32,620
plot

758
00:48:32,620 --> 00:48:38,150
the cooling conditional the Odyssey on
the screen service used by sheep capitan

759
00:48:38,150 --> 00:48:42,200
communal euphrates at high tide low tide
a storm coming he nor

760
00:48:42,200 --> 00:48:47,380
whenever weaver problem and popcorn but
is not an easy issue on

761
00:48:47,380 --> 00:48:53,820
on the data yet so weekend Oct sequin
entering the back end

762
00:48:53,820 --> 00:48:57,950
this is just an example but yet if it is
no DBT own imagination

763
00:48:57,950 --> 00:49:03,130
and that such ease them into be loved if
they don't have any control because

764
00:49:03,130 --> 00:49:06,540
will be designed to see them know what
an even four did that

765
00:49:06,540 --> 00:49:09,560
fam my teachers called the can can mean

766
00:49:09,560 --> 00:49:13,060
VIPs okay

767
00:49:13,060 --> 00:49:16,550
so all the problem affect change

768
00:49:16,550 --> 00:49:19,610
applications such as a by federal
National

769
00:49:19,610 --> 00:49:23,690
for mystery Inc sequined action on a
sonic for

770
00:49:23,690 --> 00:49:27,160
then applicable here to the pic NC
steaming Stan

771
00:49:27,160 --> 00:49:31,800
even achieves or in vessel traffic
CNBC's

772
00:49:31,800 --> 00:49:34,890
became contrail

773
00:49:34,890 --> 00:49:38,260
sewer find any peace

774
00:49:38,260 --> 00:49:41,420
last example is there

775
00:49:41,420 --> 00:49:45,920
is related to may problema our own
devices so much what he called it a

776
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:49,290
point to have such problem but our
transponder repeating it too much

777
00:49:49,290 --> 00:49:50,240
traffic

778
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:53,410
he basically to a cat in a panic

779
00:49:53,410 --> 00:49:56,610
so we show a narrower seen get

780
00:49:56,610 --> 00:50:01,690
it is too much a night on the town and I
dunno when they have to transmit

781
00:50:01,690 --> 00:50:04,740
okay because the transmission works is
following suit

782
00:50:04,740 --> 00:50:09,550
basically transponder release into the
China 88 understand when the Chinese 30

783
00:50:09,550 --> 00:50:11,300
an eternity is booked

784
00:50:11,300 --> 00:50:15,840
because USB CDMA slots diffusion if it
is too much noise on the China sleepy

785
00:50:15,840 --> 00:50:16,590
continue

786
00:50:16,590 --> 00:50:20,780
sending messages even and MSG trash

787
00:50:20,780 --> 00:50:24,910
you want understand when his food know
when his book say we put in an hour

788
00:50:24,910 --> 00:50:28,560
and we stopped working on top of it

789
00:50:28,560 --> 00:50:33,160
I think de Cebu alternator he do
something about you we going to cost you

790
00:50:33,160 --> 00:50:36,410
a vivid memory CPU or the transponder

791
00:50:36,410 --> 00:50:40,340
be kids a kiss yet abedi cannot even get
the GPS

792
00:50:40,340 --> 00:50:45,170
seeking admit any GPS nobody fix so
probably the functionality with one fish

793
00:50:45,170 --> 00:50:48,480
had responded is to get the position
from GPS simple casket

794
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:52,040
so if you can get the position with GPS
me swept that easy

795
00:50:52,040 --> 00:50:55,330
busy we are going we had a we had
overloading be

796
00:50:55,330 --> 00:50:59,950
data source a transponder so it's very
easy for in a packet even to generate

797
00:50:59,950 --> 00:51:03,730
Gandalf random garbage Indiana

798
00:51:03,730 --> 00:51:08,890
and turn to be asked to respond unusable

799
00:51:08,890 --> 00:51:12,280
we have a serial what experiment

800
00:51:12,280 --> 00:51:15,550
that we come back to shiel

801
00:51:15,550 --> 00:51:19,780
too bad the problem we identified

802
00:51:19,780 --> 00:51:22,970
is not only related to our transponder

803
00:51:22,970 --> 00:51:26,230
and I'm not only problem fat we

804
00:51:26,230 --> 00:51:29,570
we evaluated know what lab but we made
the area

805
00:51:29,570 --> 00:51:34,350
experiment outdoor when we violate the
call to rage

806
00:51:34,350 --> 00:51:37,410
to let we show it was he actually he's
able from

807
00:51:37,410 --> 00:51:40,890
in a packet ease expertly

808
00:51:40,890 --> 00:51:44,910
able to to generated to convey such
malicious attack

809
00:51:44,910 --> 00:51:48,560
and we have some beat about that I'm not
going to show now because

810
00:51:48,560 --> 00:51:52,200
you don't have time bath I'm happy to
share with you she should come to his

811
00:51:52,200 --> 00:51:54,890
mean the next today or tomorrow

812
00:51:54,890 --> 00:52:00,190
I can show you DVD obesity what
experiments

813
00:52:00,190 --> 00:52:03,780
of course said that cease peace problem
a pretty severe

814
00:52:03,780 --> 00:52:07,820
I have to do a responsible disclosure
sad to say that we come back

815
00:52:07,820 --> 00:52:11,950
this experiment without interfering with
existing system

816
00:52:11,950 --> 00:52:15,010
in particular mess is a bit odd habit
have separate implication

817
00:52:15,010 --> 00:52:18,050
samples one was a for example there

818
00:52:18,050 --> 00:52:21,970
the No sport inclusion on at to being
issued out of track

819
00:52:21,970 --> 00:52:25,130
or misinterpreted SOS so too

820
00:52:25,130 --> 00:52:28,900
let the stress be gone the F test the
only in a lab environment

821
00:52:28,900 --> 00:52:32,000
so we connect their for some a family
big

822
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:36,859
creepy connect like the transponder to
the radio to keep meant the app via

823
00:52:36,859 --> 00:52:37,680
wired

824
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:40,870
and then we teach up

825
00:52:40,870 --> 00:52:45,220
Opteron to with a child up from nap the
provider

826
00:52:45,220 --> 00:52:48,220
me to an affected by problems so money
in traffic

827
00:52:48,220 --> 00:52:52,859
as: add mess and find a cheap find a
better before major online is provider

828
00:52:52,859 --> 00:52:57,310
ending a guy c you should buy need to be
determined to collect because

829
00:52:57,310 --> 00:53:02,280
began be ever she can have seen and yes
a compact IV authorities

830
00:53:02,280 --> 00:53:05,680
we compared the I am or meet
international mean organization on

831
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:09,250
which is on the top or Italian
authorities

832
00:53:09,250 --> 00:53:14,490
weakened by I T U and which is being
edited medication sector all the

833
00:53:14,490 --> 00:53:16,430
International Telecommunication you need

834
00:53:16,430 --> 00:53:20,030
and that a guy vituperative
specification

835
00:53:20,030 --> 00:53:25,100
and weak and died today yes cause garth
and you can come out again is a shot

836
00:53:25,100 --> 00:53:28,770
up front and we share with them I wanna
South and I could be collaborating with

837
00:53:28,770 --> 00:53:30,480
them too

838
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:34,180
have the problem addressed somehow so

839
00:53:34,180 --> 00:53:37,570
somebody countermeasure we proposed and
we also propose to peace

840
00:53:37,570 --> 00:53:40,780
good condition body is to implement out
indication

841
00:53:40,780 --> 00:53:44,190
to be able to their to issue it has meat
that is the owner

842
00:53:44,190 --> 00:53:49,320
a ship Kate indication can be done in
different way we can discuss later

843
00:53:49,320 --> 00:53:52,440
and these prevent spoofing attacks

844
00:53:52,440 --> 00:53:55,680
we also report squared I'm check

845
00:53:55,680 --> 00:53:59,660
to our avoid the replay attacks and
possibly to take an assist in packet and

846
00:53:59,660 --> 00:54:02,730
they play the tech back in the future

847
00:54:02,730 --> 00:54:05,980
we also propose integrity monitoring

848
00:54:05,980 --> 00:54:09,240
to damp air to avoid bumping weaver

849
00:54:09,240 --> 00:54:12,630
existing ass message that says I
checking as we guy

850
00:54:12,630 --> 00:54:16,740
go to college and question before

851
00:54:16,740 --> 00:54:20,800
and find anybody to check on the context
so if I ever for example NAS get

852
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:24,520
restoration yeti Singapore imagine
anything a packet for Toshiba teasing

853
00:54:24,520 --> 00:54:25,330
embossed on

854
00:54:25,330 --> 00:54:29,350
doesn't make sense that the messy
dealership in Boston

855
00:54:29,350 --> 00:54:32,450
we love each in a yes get to hear
because he's in a way that that idea

856
00:54:32,450 --> 00:54:34,460
previously seen and flight

857
00:54:34,460 --> 00:54:38,290
planet from Boston to Singapore right so
we should do San

858
00:54:38,290 --> 00:54:42,760
an at that context when he's a shin on
the message

859
00:54:42,760 --> 00:54:47,270
said so to conclude that what I want to
take homies pad

860
00:54:47,270 --> 00:54:50,280
a/s is widely years because

861
00:54:50,280 --> 00:54:53,710
sees more than ten years is a mandatory
station for all the

862
00:54:53,710 --> 00:54:59,090
vez esta be worldwide tool at a median
of the station were right

863
00:54:59,090 --> 00:55:03,020
and is also a major technology months
effetti

864
00:55:03,020 --> 00:55:06,490
so he just SAT use their because as
being introduced

865
00:55:06,490 --> 00:55:11,250
as as an announcement to existing
Raiders

866
00:55:11,250 --> 00:55:15,570
so should be taken good next technology
is going to use them they're pushing for

867
00:55:15,570 --> 00:55:17,550
bed in the future

868
00:55:17,550 --> 00:55:21,630
and their that's why we need to be sick
when we shot and we found out the bath

869
00:55:21,630 --> 00:55:23,870
is broken up a leading politician
lebanon

870
00:55:23,870 --> 00:55:27,010
enid providers

871
00:55:27,010 --> 00:55:30,560
that call a template for Michonne an
online

872
00:55:30,560 --> 00:55:34,580
or two special parties but also protocol
like that it is very severe

873
00:55:34,580 --> 00:55:38,660
is very difficult to fix so we hope that
our work we've had been a

874
00:55:38,660 --> 00:55:42,750
you know announcing the current
situation and their

875
00:55:42,750 --> 00:55:45,820
thanks leon edition and

876
00:55:45,820 --> 00:55:49,260
April FAA he criticized then they get
there

877
00:55:49,260 --> 00:55:52,560
lunch break so Jeff question go ahead

878
00:55:52,560 --> 00:55:55,740
right now or get you up little guys

879
00:55:55,740 --> 00:56:02,740
thank you

880
00:56:05,150 --> 00:56:12,150
okay

881
00:56:13,740 --> 00:56:16,970
I'll can be but from this software play
interviewed

882
00:56:16,970 --> 00:56:20,609
the fix is a kind of not revealed but
you can do it too right

883
00:56:20,609 --> 00:56:24,140
because the problem of providers so we
can implement authentication making

884
00:56:24,140 --> 00:56:26,070
prevailed at things

885
00:56:26,070 --> 00:56:29,640
and for the practical standpoint you to
mean to the

886
00:56:29,640 --> 00:56:32,960
updated brother Carl but was more a
critique I

887
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:36,950
bodies to update publicly fume where

888
00:56:36,950 --> 00:56:41,910
with transponder and ate something that
we take time

889
00:56:41,910 --> 00:56:45,120
but at least it's better to know but it
is a problem instead of hiding

890
00:56:45,120 --> 00:56:48,200
because about lani I was in London last
week

891
00:56:48,200 --> 00:56:53,150
phonotheque could be tracks no enemy
like there wasn't that mean I care

892
00:56:53,150 --> 00:56:58,160
bully tee shot on and his guy from the
body organization and was a

893
00:56:58,160 --> 00:57:01,540
some guy from the port of Singapore from
major port were white

894
00:57:01,540 --> 00:57:05,030
and it seems like the wearer away are
somehow that the kid

895
00:57:05,030 --> 00:57:09,080
spoof such message but to hide it

896
00:57:09,080 --> 00:57:12,100
to know the new lead mean this morn

897
00:57:12,100 --> 00:57:15,460
group but Heidi so Bay Phang to me bc
you know it

898
00:57:15,460 --> 00:57:21,220
not happy that you shared pool soon
we've not on our community but worldwide

899
00:57:21,220 --> 00:57:24,359
so that we can figure out that and it's
got to be told me n

900
00:57:24,359 --> 00:57:31,359
we are going to discuss it in books and
maybe you know at sea

901
00:57:33,720 --> 00:57:38,000
sorry

902
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:41,770
on as: has been known that our San

903
00:57:41,770 --> 00:57:44,830
has been reported Sam gays bare

904
00:57:44,830 --> 00:57:48,400
Eva program

905
00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:52,960
draw only fair grasp on their because
there they want to hide sent information

906
00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:54,020
about a ship

907
00:57:54,020 --> 00:57:57,420
or debate the Z beloved transponder

908
00:57:57,420 --> 00:58:01,640
on par plus because we don't want to
shift to disable outside

909
00:58:01,640 --> 00:58:04,850
and even from the online spoofing

910
00:58:04,850 --> 00:58:08,240
if you go bad known at docs help people

911
00:58:08,240 --> 00:58:11,550
that try to put information

912
00:58:11,550 --> 00:58:17,380
2009 providers but data package show you
now want to bet expanded not yet

913
00:58:17,380 --> 00:58:21,550
but BP not yet

914
00:58:21,550 --> 00:58:28,490
guess

915
00:58:28,490 --> 00:58:31,640
a

916
00:58:31,640 --> 00:58:36,120
maybeee aviation industry bodies a
protocol occurrence

917
00:58:36,120 --> 00:58:40,020
essentially that protocol that sees them
it has been disabled on this flight

918
00:58:40,020 --> 00:58:45,130
Malaysia and each it's basically created
for a yes because used for monitoring

919
00:58:45,130 --> 00:58:49,520
and flights as: easing from i 10 ships

920
00:58:49,520 --> 00:58:54,470
free the same but in addition a/s is
also seized him to calm troll sheep
