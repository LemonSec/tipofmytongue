1
00:00:00,149 --> 00:00:03,110
I really want on my name is Kelly L

2
00:00:03,110 --> 00:00:06,830
I director of aviation tapped in from
foreign that can add up

3
00:00:06,830 --> 00:00:10,780
today I can talk about some I APT
attacks

4
00:00:10,780 --> 00:00:15,540
have anarchy us Aria and there are

5
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:19,230
80s lights in this presentation eighty

6
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:23,039
yes so please bear with me and here we
get the fun part

7
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:27,580
right so

8
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:31,210
here is such an so we start from Dr the
March 20 or so tak

9
00:00:31,210 --> 00:00:35,130
from last year and then go through based
on the terrace East Bay condo percent

10
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:37,890
relate one mission mission and a story
go XP

11
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:41,190
those four operations mean I've heard of
right

12
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:44,280
the last two flaming and them to

13
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:47,930
anyone heard of it except for acclaim
from Kaspersky

14
00:00:47,930 --> 00:00:52,170
anyone great

15
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:59,059
so lets guests are from the upper tak

16
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:04,439
so here is in Pak huge impact are two
parts

17
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:07,850
from the bank initial I institutions

18
00:01:07,850 --> 00:01:11,640
and the media you can see that five
cells in

19
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:14,760
employees computers 57 branches

20
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:18,900
60b servers impact is huge

21
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:21,930
so

22
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:24,970
what kind of things you toast them which

23
00:01:24,970 --> 00:01:28,220
here is a wiper case one

24
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:31,220
the case one is internal use it a the
number

25
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:35,130
so it doesn't mean anything okay to the
chopper

26
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:38,400
compile at is a compile-time

27
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,439
are a orange on and I

28
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:45,670
its job for file agent-based I XD

29
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:49,570
I meet yet CPR want that app guarantee
that yes E

30
00:01:49,570 --> 00:01:54,530
so there are two kinds of fibers the
first one is for the Windows

31
00:01:54,530 --> 00:01:58,860
the other one is for the linux/unix so

32
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:03,390
SKS are from the windows on okay

33
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:07,409
so first is gonna check have found
making object

34
00:02:07,409 --> 00:02:10,899
if the thing is just in any create

35
00:02:10,899 --> 00:02:14,280
and then try to q2

36
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:17,459
security I'll

37
00:02:17,459 --> 00:02:21,250
process among be up and how r suffer and
then

38
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:26,040
my point my are you and me are is pretty
simple

39
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:29,099
and 34 remember

40
00:02:29,099 --> 00:02:36,099
simple 34 here see other

41
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:41,340
operation system my purse four different
kinds

42
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:44,510
except the last one for the

43
00:02:44,510 --> 00:02:49,080
general index their justice delayed or
the import and directories

44
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:52,700
ISSN it the other three are trying to

45
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:58,050
right zeros on you NPR so it's just
destroy a hard choice

46
00:02:58,050 --> 00:03:02,349
and to be farm

47
00:03:02,349 --> 00:03:05,720
this is not the only case here is
another one

48
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:10,459
is still a little bit complex

49
00:03:10,459 --> 00:03:16,459
and the first one s injector so it's
just inject the wiper into Iran in

50
00:03:16,459 --> 00:03:17,090
protest

51
00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:24,090
this one is still a friend

52
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:29,060
it has a time bomb its preset marks 20
years

53
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:33,379
3 p.m. an axe

54
00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:37,930
the fam mapping object and the result

55
00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:44,930
steel simple and 34 here is another case

56
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:54,700
fell mapping object and thank you
process

57
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:58,760
and that I it also I set up

58
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:03,349
time on their March 20 years 2 p.m.

59
00:04:03,349 --> 00:04:08,670
you see on the left to southern Turkey

60
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:14,110
March 20 years 2pa in st.

61
00:04:14,110 --> 00:04:21,070
by the strengths you I'm BR is pretty
quick break

62
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:26,699
okay here we may have some questions
race hold talks wipers

63
00:04:26,699 --> 00:04:31,350
got to the computers because

64
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:35,750
the wiper is simple and straightforward
it doesn't have any warm function

65
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:39,169
halsell replicating functions at helping

66
00:04:39,169 --> 00:04:42,889
a itself to spread by using the Internet
right

67
00:04:42,889 --> 00:04:45,940
so there must be something

68
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:52,940
missed

69
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:58,840
here you and you I found this it all
makes sense

70
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:02,460
swept her a spreader so the dropper
compile

71
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:07,430
the before the attack

72
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:10,889
and it job to files tutsi pulse

73
00:05:10,889 --> 00:05:17,530
update that seep and BMS 1014 that's it

74
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:20,550
the VMS II I'll

75
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:25,710
sorry II diid II file he sexually be up
by Rose Bowl

76
00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:31,610
security management system contribution
file its update contraction file

77
00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:36,030
the other one other don't know the EXT
how

78
00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:39,610
is such a review by per case 3

79
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:45,539
exactly match

80
00:05:45,539 --> 00:05:50,870
cell s brief introduce you to a security
security menaces and

81
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:56,130
it has a central server and its
management mention manage it

82
00:05:56,130 --> 00:05:59,539
so many clients I mean from the damage

83
00:05:59,539 --> 00:06:02,889
like five thousand employees computers
so

84
00:06:02,889 --> 00:06:06,860
to update will push from the central
server

85
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:13,860
to all the clients

86
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:18,880
here is steered the content of this
contribution file

87
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:22,860
there are some important bannister the
first

88
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:27,840
if I were Shin it's easy to understand
his fellow Russian

89
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:33,390
and Israel founding this value sex 3gp
in RI

90
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:37,190
which is this EMS

91
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:40,740
myself someone that's it so that's

92
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:47,660
thanks to a file in C in this file down
south St Ste

93
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:51,330
the T veld ice okay

94
00:06:51,330 --> 00:06:58,330
and the update the saudi doctors missed
12 Klein received

95
00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:04,790
adapted adopted the file it to extra the
update file

96
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:08,120
into this directory isn't restored

97
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:15,120
attacked a directory in the wreckage
entries here

98
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:20,970
we go to comfort competition files
that's handy someone wants

99
00:07:20,970 --> 00:07:24,230
actuator majors around I insist normal
one

100
00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:30,110
so we can see the different I had it in
the rat up more once

101
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:34,590
are actually modify you file size: stone
tiles ice

102
00:07:34,590 --> 00:07:39,390
and updated on this really compared to
normal one

103
00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:45,110
so why made it do this because he'd

104
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:50,410
it must match to see file it dropped so
we can see

105
00:07:50,410 --> 00:07:55,150
today matched 2010 October 14th

106
00:07:55,150 --> 00:08:02,150
and file size:

107
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:06,830
to cross ice roof are signs and our
house

108
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:10,160
indicate into up if our attributes

109
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:13,760
St compressed file size and decompress

110
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:17,750
sites so basically

111
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:21,160
a so is a serious basically it will try
to

112
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:25,410
replace else to files exists on a
central server

113
00:08:25,410 --> 00:08:28,410
and want to update happened you're
pushed is still

114
00:08:28,410 --> 00:08:33,550
into all the clients and I see how it do
it

115
00:08:33,550 --> 00:08:38,110
here for seventy pancha process

116
00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:42,979
belongs to the ER /url security
management systems

117
00:08:42,979 --> 00:08:49,040
and then

118
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:53,660
replace a kid out the central server is
hahaha so this key

119
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:56,870
I am this key value is sex restored the

120
00:08:56,870 --> 00:09:00,940
you our the central server get out that
for all

121
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:05,230
so is replaced with this race esmine
descent disable the central server

122
00:09:05,230 --> 00:09:08,340
to get update from the remote web site
soul

123
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:12,440
if the sensors or can get update that
means all the clients can get a bit

124
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:17,260
right and then did it

125
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:20,670
two files exist on this

126
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:24,340
management system security menaces in
update at sea

127
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:28,660
and BMS 1014 that's it exactly

128
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:35,660
it to files chop up but up by the proper
and then chopped up the files

129
00:09:37,330 --> 00:09:40,400
into specific

130
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:43,959
directory again

131
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:50,960
to specific directory but

132
00:09:51,430 --> 00:09:55,830
to binary reversing engine is just tell
me a scenery

133
00:09:55,830 --> 00:09:59,500
right we don't really know whether it's
for it works

134
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:05,740
cited a test and you know the central
server and then

135
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:10,460
insula Klein and running did my sis file
on the central source I'm

136
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:15,280
and then lunch doubt they from the
client site you can see that

137
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:19,550
deputies view still going on the
background and

138
00:10:19,550 --> 00:10:22,910
this up contribution file you can see

139
00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:27,440
is ready in replaced is pushed

140
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:30,470
from the centrist over to decline see

141
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:33,620
all th down thought you exceed
especially

142
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:38,750
a viper so let's eat like

143
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:43,080
here okay the Viper

144
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:47,640
Cup into your computers all the
computers mention

145
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:54,640
managed by this security management
system and here

146
00:10:57,530 --> 00:11:02,130
period sexually or no more that kid will
fall

147
00:11:02,130 --> 00:11:07,300
used by this security management system
somewhat

148
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:11,060
it's not replaced yet it s

149
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:14,370
up is still ongoing

150
00:11:14,370 --> 00:11:17,660
one database finished

151
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:21,630
to normal application has replaced

152
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:27,560
by the wiper for now

153
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:30,930
is an intruder to run this

154
00:11:30,930 --> 00:11:34,600
but a serious to replace a normal
application

155
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:37,690
used by the security management system

156
00:11:37,690 --> 00:11:40,839
of course is some security reasons in
september or

157
00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:43,940
occasionally run this fall and

158
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:50,940
actually I just wait finance and I
checked the MBR

159
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:55,690
great all when I found this I was like

160
00:11:55,690 --> 00:12:02,690
W p

161
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:05,890
soul interesting this is

162
00:12:05,890 --> 00:12:10,290
the only my purse brother they are all

163
00:12:10,290 --> 00:12:14,020
here

164
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:17,780
here's another my purse rather

165
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:21,310
actually I think opportunity I didn't
got chopper

166
00:12:21,310 --> 00:12:25,230
maybe it actually

167
00:12:25,230 --> 00:12:28,690
don't have a chopper it's too fast and
he

168
00:12:28,690 --> 00:12:31,870
setup I and be set up to I and

169
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:35,990
on tenor da txt MP setup ISTE

170
00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:39,050
update country file for and that

171
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:44,870
policy Center the content or 90s he is
actually the wiper

172
00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:51,470
case wall exact match but there's no
connection

173
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:55,560
right and I see the content you

174
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:59,540
says connected all

175
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:03,180
so I guess the same theory

176
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:07,310
happened I didn't asshole

177
00:13:07,310 --> 00:13:14,310
because I didn't have to talk or so

178
00:13:15,950 --> 00:13:22,950
let's take a look up the security men
business and used

179
00:13:28,629 --> 00:13:29,970
it starts to make sense right

180
00:13:29,970 --> 00:13:33,639
so

181
00:13:33,639 --> 00:13:39,830
what do we learn from this for the
security men

182
00:13:39,830 --> 00:13:43,320
system we should have a all protect

183
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:47,000
ok we should protect our own process
Aqeel

184
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:51,530
process it won't happen and implement

185
00:13:51,530 --> 00:13:55,040
at least lead to be strong were
vacationing

186
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:58,090
tearing you up the wall who

187
00:13:58,090 --> 00:14:01,510
moments or so

188
00:14:01,510 --> 00:14:06,620
for the companies or organizations it
seems

189
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:10,920
we shouldn't stake on a single security
management system

190
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:14,200
because

191
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:19,560
it's a weak point it's actually shows us
how they turn out

192
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:24,300
shield into their spears I

193
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:31,300
mom

194
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:40,110
here so there are still some questions

195
00:14:40,110 --> 00:14:43,350
confusing because ice the last one

196
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:47,660
yes the same how those wipers

197
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:50,940
brother Scott into I'll on two computers

198
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:57,300
right and other thing is actually there
are three bipartisan special

199
00:14:57,300 --> 00:15:00,750
before but I think I just fine to

200
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:04,000
kisses match the Vipers further are
still missing

201
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,160
so is there any other more

202
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:14,160
down all this one and

203
00:15:15,690 --> 00:15:20,270
the pepper spray other the secretary job
the files

204
00:15:20,270 --> 00:15:25,130
into a specific directory wonder if I
installed a security management system

205
00:15:25,130 --> 00:15:30,120
into another directory remember them
were right it won't work

206
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:37,120
and/or sir questions

207
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:46,460
so before we trying to I'll find more
related

208
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:51,330
samples person even need to see two
characteristics in those wipers

209
00:15:51,330 --> 00:15:57,730
and wiper spreaders by all the common
parts

210
00:15:57,730 --> 00:16:02,500
no occur you may have new pics but now
these

211
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:06,310
who treat UPS acker second

212
00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:10,220
film acting up there

213
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:14,550
I'm all three important since

214
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:17,740
and

215
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:23,300
accretion tall a packer

216
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:26,860
similar filmmaking object I'm ball

217
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:30,320
East it's cheap or call there's no
harrassing

218
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:33,900
HTTP poor share similar pale

219
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:37,220
because they are not only one choice
case

220
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:42,380
soul for example there are six cases
there're share similar pale

221
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:45,920
and how hit me loss that's the toy

222
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:52,920
all name improbable

223
00:16:55,690 --> 00:16:59,120
try case while star from a dollar

224
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:02,949
and then enter or they some different
all

225
00:17:02,949 --> 00:17:06,270
open system a joke different files

226
00:17:06,270 --> 00:17:09,959
basically is

227
00:17:09,959 --> 00:17:13,970
either Joe to paleo or

228
00:17:13,970 --> 00:17:20,970
job I injector all or a privilege
escalator

229
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:30,750
here's another 10 based on different

230
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:33,980
criticisms or 32-bit or 64-bit

231
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:40,980
juppe different when I checked the
compiled

232
00:17:43,390 --> 00:17:48,200
it's one month before 1 based on months
before the attack

233
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:51,549
so that see

234
00:17:51,549 --> 00:17:55,559
the pale file mapping object home

235
00:17:55,559 --> 00:18:00,809
and then Corey the 3v3 interest to kick
it I D use in the

236
00:18:00,809 --> 00:18:04,650
I HTTP request also

237
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:08,030
string is in cricket I just showed the

238
00:18:08,030 --> 00:18:12,179
the critical I'm ball

239
00:18:12,179 --> 00:18:19,179
things nothing to explain

240
00:18:22,210 --> 00:18:25,370
communication part request

241
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:29,320

secret the value is nothing for a

246
00:18:49,470 --> 00:18:50,130
gruesome

247
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:54,450
and the key simple

248
00:18:54,450 --> 00:18:59,960
here's comments

249
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:03,420
we couple you need to understand we
capitulated

250
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:06,960
in Terre Haute said in told that the

251
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:11,240
the children and then to the census or
and I'll

252
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:14,840
EXE see all the file and skidded

253
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:18,560
map at best

254
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:22,970
this one it's interesting you try to
write

255
00:19:22,970 --> 00:19:27,960
all the following information into one
single file and the store I local

256
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:32,270
I'll try and then my niece the optimal
comin to upload this

257
00:19:32,270 --> 00:19:36,120
it's me

258
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:39,630
it offers to ap questions at least

259
00:19:39,630 --> 00:19:45,040
maybe the computer just got destroyed

260
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:48,190
and Donald other wiper now spread it
either

261
00:19:48,190 --> 00:19:51,940
wiper spreader and holding no

262
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:55,090
you in store the security management
system into that there are three

263
00:19:55,090 --> 00:19:58,110
my past pick up

264
00:19:58,110 --> 00:20:05,110
or you'll false information help us knew
it

not rads PDB file: us I highlighted

266
00:20:19,410 --> 00:20:25,040
to commence up oh then Matt fast send me
a lot of time

267
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:30,630

me know the st. compilat

277
00:21:04,970 --> 00:21:08,890
the Secretary of her the wiper attack

278
00:21:08,890 --> 00:21:13,080
three days out there dewey

279
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:16,220
I'm be received any report that copter

280
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:20,150
the March 20 years there are other
organizations or

281
00:21:20,150 --> 00:21:23,700
institutions got all I their hot right

282
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:30,700
Detroit all no

283
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:36,410
I I see how

284
00:21:36,410 --> 00:21:42,290
once I'm up how to act

285
00:21:42,290 --> 00:21:45,830
but the stupid and changed global

286
00:21:45,830 --> 00:21:49,770
trash resource share

287
00:21:49,770 --> 00:21:53,870
and that's the same thing accurate Rd

288
00:21:53,870 --> 00:22:00,440
I coring it's really pitched ranchers
here

289
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:03,830
is quite different this other choice his
you

290
00:22:03,830 --> 00:22:07,680
I you I can if their friend address a
response

291
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:12,030
you another I'll creampie you think

292
00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:15,240
RSL using

293
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:18,930
you DP Porco to get you artist another
nest

294
00:22:18,930 --> 00:22:22,760
and usage C 40 to get more I'll

295
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:27,210
and then what you can be R&B artist

296
00:22:27,210 --> 00:22:31,420
0 personal strength

297
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:35,400
there or and come how they see three
days after

298
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:42,400
the attack March 20 s

299
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:50,140
here is another question is like if

300
00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:54,340
some organizations or institutions got
there are talking about

301
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:57,400
after piper tech they issued

302
00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:03,350
report or

303
00:23:03,350 --> 00:23:09,160
they can trip or so what kind of
organization institutions can report

304
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:09,910
that was kinda

305
00:23:09,910 --> 00:23:16,820
attack I shall

306
00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:20,440
I'll share my opinions at last at the
end of the presentation for this

307
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:20,970
question

308
00:23:20,970 --> 00:23:25,150
up here 27 you know

309
00:23:25,150 --> 00:23:28,380
characteristics I might not like

310
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:33,560
the stream corruption is using axe or

311
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:37,210
it's the first part calculated the ideal
saying this

312
00:23:37,210 --> 00:23:41,150
other trinkets is it is you pequot and

313
00:23:41,150 --> 00:23:44,230
in the park or and using are saying

314
00:23:44,230 --> 00:23:47,730
key while become a number p1 it's a

315
00:23:47,730 --> 00:23:50,760
it's just like tak he while

316
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:54,220
soul

317
00:23:54,220 --> 00:24:01,220
is that all

318
00:24:01,330 --> 00:24:04,720
operation mission share similar things
ok actor

319
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:09,570
similar found mapping object hindpaw a
City porthole and IRC channel

320
00:24:09,570 --> 00:24:12,690
us

321
00:24:12,690 --> 00:24:17,350
lying is the pick-up are all you help us
name can prop

322
00:24:17,350 --> 00:24:22,240
here's mission place

323
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:27,850
yep

324

355
00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:56,730
a question one mission similar St

356

I'll

362
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:26,620
shopper is similar is the I between
cases

363
00:27:26,620 --> 00:27:33,620
treatin us into massing this one more 34

364
00:27:34,190 --> 00:27:37,399
there's no I injector or permitted
escalator

365
00:27:37,399 --> 00:27:41,799
just isn't 32 bit or 64

366
00:27:41,799 --> 00:27:45,020
64 bit chop tax appeal

367
00:27:45,020 --> 00:27:48,120
this one is much more complicated not
only do

368
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:51,890
I 32-bit or 64-bit or 32-bit awesome 64
bit

369
00:27:51,890 --> 00:27:58,890
you also get the right number specific
remember on

370
00:28:00,570 --> 00:28:04,760
mission telecommunication at and similar
to the choice

371
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:08,980
and that I am here star with two

372
00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:13,279
turns and then calculate after that all

373
00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:16,370
rather either its a candidate

374
00:28:16,370 --> 00:28:19,620
i cor either 3 Ricky three entries

375
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:22,950
or your Mac Address to hear you me

376
00:28:22,950 --> 00:28:27,070
are at some other vendors report if they
put both

377
00:28:27,070 --> 00:28:30,340
ID's in their report

378
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:34,610
there actually mac Address after that so
you might tell

379
00:28:34,610 --> 00:28:37,809
weather at the and I school mahler in
the

380
00:28:37,809 --> 00:28:44,520
or commissioning all remorse and their
rights a response to

381
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:48,020
its founding same

382
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:53,090
asset or case the crib the file using
base64 in RI said

383
00:28:53,090 --> 00:28:57,799
missing each city coral and IRC channel
there are 28 comments

384
00:28:57,799 --> 00:29:00,960
her to make a mess but the function the
same

385
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:04,370
uphold the whole report

386
00:29:04,370 --> 00:29:10,780
bypass here

387
00:29:10,780 --> 00:29:14,990
my mission pay no corporate the mistakes
how many of her

388
00:29:14,990 --> 00:29:19,740
newest might have passed so

389
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:23,620
string thing is actually a

390
00:29:23,620 --> 00:29:27,700
see us for before it hits us

391
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:31,720
clock that they have an essential to the
remote server

392
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:35,210
without any compression or encryption
its I'm

393
00:29:35,210 --> 00:29:41,490
compressible and I send it inherit the
new on

394
00:29:41,490 --> 00:29:44,539
the base 64 and are saying he 0

395
00:29:44,539 --> 00:29:48,409
remember try to remember to ski 0 using
one mission

396
00:29:48,409 --> 00:29:52,799
yes another

397
00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:58,100
operations star share similar things
this is the first time we

398
00:29:58,100 --> 00:30:01,980
on yes tell PDP it's important

399
00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:06,159
it on this weekend find more things
person number two point

400
00:30:06,159 --> 00:30:09,190
10 or

401
00:30:09,190 --> 00:30:12,409
say miss one mission

402
00:30:12,409 --> 00:30:19,409
also said

403
00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:28,590
and the base on those characteristics

404
00:30:28,590 --> 00:30:32,450
we find another operation black skin Rs

405
00:30:32,450 --> 00:30:35,590
much more seminar no packer

406
00:30:35,590 --> 00:30:39,520
seminar I'll backing up that I'm all its
sprawling

407
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:43,120
anarchy channel worsen 2.0

408
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:48,200
so we can clear seeded

409
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:52,260
it's at the bottom pols CSS question
number

410
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:56,670
2.1 2.0 2.02 I wanted

411
00:30:56,670 --> 00:31:01,740
long here

412
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:06,060
said in store did

413
00:31:06,060 --> 00:31:11,050
to that one mission mention
characteristics

414
00:31:11,050 --> 00:31:14,420
almost the same so here

415
00:31:14,420 --> 00:31:19,520
which we case

416
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:23,620
is sexually not happening on 2013 the
prototype is actually

417
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:26,810
long 2009 core payroll

418
00:31:26,810 --> 00:31:30,360
and it connected or operations blacks

419
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:33,620
into and and start 2011

420
00:31:33,620 --> 00:31:37,950
more mission to South uncertain

421
00:31:37,950 --> 00:31:43,060
one mission to South tall here

422
00:31:43,060 --> 00:31:46,470
I just while gonna get those

423
00:31:46,470 --> 00:31:51,090
I just can't believe it's the at it
consists from

424
00:31:51,090 --> 00:31:55,660
to 2013 always backed into south and

425
00:31:55,660 --> 00:31:59,910
11 2010 I just can't believe it's

426
00:31:59,910 --> 00:32:03,050
it stay at home so before who

427
00:32:03,050 --> 00:32:06,600
I'll trying to find more samples

428
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:12,050
still need to find home the
characteristics all those operations

429
00:32:12,050 --> 00:32:18,560
mapping object all

430
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:22,280
string corruption calculate

431
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:25,770
yeah I did you sing which the
bureaucrats it is

432
00:32:25,770 --> 00:32:28,930
HTTP request advanced the patents may
change but

433
00:32:28,930 --> 00:32:33,510
it cheaper or 864 aren't saying
corruption

434
00:32:33,510 --> 00:32:37,000
IRC channel mad at us

435
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:44,000
and then the possum or

436
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:53,869
I found this operation slaying worsen
1.0

437
00:32:53,869 --> 00:32:57,940
is compiled al 2007 marks evince yes

438
00:32:57,940 --> 00:33:01,369
is the very first the worse and now all
those

439
00:33:01,369 --> 00:33:05,059
operations earth for so long use

440
00:33:05,059 --> 00:33:08,580
it's the porthole and

441
00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:12,429
won the I actually got all the data from

442
00:33:12,429 --> 00:33:15,460
the source I just and save it

443
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:20,909
so communication percolates a single
city and zip file

444
00:33:20,909 --> 00:33:24,919
and this house architecture that have
problems

445
00:33:24,919 --> 00:33:29,110
so it has to take USB number

446
00:33:29,110 --> 00:33:33,259
map ass all keylogger

447
00:33:33,259 --> 00:33:40,259
email stealer

448
00:33:44,509 --> 00:33:47,769
and operation claim 2.0

449
00:33:47,769 --> 00:33:51,289
portion from 11 12 1.6

450
00:33:51,289 --> 00:33:57,039
there in that year 2008 it's actually a
star

451
00:33:57,039 --> 00:34:01,220
farm pure IRC channel there's no HTTP
port

452
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:05,059
going at pure IRC all and then

453
00:34:05,059 --> 00:34:09,589
at the late development their ship from
my arse into a combination of pity for

454
00:34:09,589 --> 00:34:10,899
all and IRC channel

455
00:34:10,899 --> 00:34:15,220
it's also for a fact that being

456
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:22,220
other operations HCP morality tale and
interesting streams

457
00:34:22,889 --> 00:34:26,319
arm cost new look at home and in detail

458
00:34:26,319 --> 00:34:29,809
and still remember daresay key 0

459
00:34:29,809 --> 00:34:32,950
you think the other operations I'll

460
00:34:32,950 --> 00:34:38,839
the strengths is interesting secretary

461
00:34:38,839 --> 00:34:42,549
told us there Park its

462
00:34:42,549 --> 00:34:46,619
also use all strengths St IRC channel

463
00:34:46,619 --> 00:34:50,470
name it would join us have to channel
and that's an information service

464
00:34:50,470 --> 00:34:54,290
artsy soul arming

465
00:34:54,290 --> 00:34:59,410
hostile see army calls for preventing
the Korean military academy

466
00:34:59,410 --> 00:35:02,950
so the Navy Lodge comets military parts

467
00:35:02,950 --> 00:35:06,349
and spy or and and the jaw

468
00:35:06,349 --> 00:35:13,349
Ministry of National Defense lessons

469
00:35:14,859 --> 00:35:19,910
the those are or the pardons now

470
00:35:19,910 --> 00:35:24,670
in the late help it's that man

471
00:35:24,670 --> 00:35:29,640
purple change a little bit meter
engineering department

472
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:34,490
Korean military academy are okay US
combined force

473
00:35:34,490 --> 00:35:39,000
so when the target is clear

474
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:42,059
not ask questions to be

475
00:35:42,059 --> 00:35:49,059
well either pearl

476
00:35:51,850 --> 00:35:54,840
see you sensitive documents disable or
system

477
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:58,850
how they steal you sensitive documents
the cost

478
00:35:58,850 --> 00:36:02,040
operation flame or Persian prince 2.0

479
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:08,310
ass ability to uphold file similar to
the toy kids

480
00:36:08,310 --> 00:36:11,920
is to remember that my past who got all
it real

481
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:17,670
right all you file permissions into one
single file and then sent to the census

482
00:36:17,670 --> 00:36:19,680
or thought they would just try to search

483
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:23,310
things some access to it

484
00:36:23,310 --> 00:36:27,760
sensitive documents and then trying to
specifically

485

from the Mac I S another interesting

489
00:36:45,180 --> 00:36:49,150
thing is actually in that late I'll its
development

490
00:36:49,150 --> 00:36:53,480
it tried to identify whether the
infected system

491
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:59,180
its a are system so

492
00:36:59,180 --> 00:37:03,000
yet what is a AR system use

493
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:07,160
a action required system it management

494
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:11,880
managed or your digital assets and also
your digital

495
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:15,720
Titans so they are not

496
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:18,930
only interested in your the toll sings

497
00:37:18,930 --> 00:37:22,440

further our team to the system and anger
and access our

504
00:37:47,130 --> 00:37:51,400
so let us know with that means you can

505

00:37:56,230 --> 00:38:00,070
the targets not only interested in your
digital document

507
00:38:00,070 --> 00:38:03,160
but also interesting and hurrying

508
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:07,260
your facility another way is to

509
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:10,980
grand the excess to someone already

510
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:14,330

digital

516
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:45,920
here

517
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:50,619
how so many I PDB file: us for Oracle
Corp you know

518
00:38:50,619 --> 00:38:55,079
yes I'll we can proceed it right are

519
00:38:55,079 --> 00:38:58,670
to rate and in korea

520

backdoor work

522
00:39:06,390 --> 00:39:11,499
plan and loveseat ya

523
00:39:11,499 --> 00:39:14,989
when are 14 15-17 making

524
00:39:14,989 --> 00:39:19,479
its long way about of and you know

525
00:39:19,479 --> 00:39:23,710
you know art in might be the computer
name or

526
00:39:23,710 --> 00:39:30,710
real processing on nickname

527
00:39:33,670 --> 00:39:40,559
now I'm happy rehab here

528
00:39:40,559 --> 00:39:44,579
here is that the at the Taphouse of or
the cor-

529
00:39:44,579 --> 00:39:48,690
functions core I'll the Estadio el

530
00:39:48,690 --> 00:39:52,770
star from 2007 along too southern
certain

531
00:39:52,770 --> 00:39:55,920
with an interesting things I in 2008

532
00:39:55,920 --> 00:40:00,490
their a branch there and one crashed you

533
00:40:00,490 --> 00:40:03,890
continue to development the frame 1 and
another branch to

534
00:40:03,890 --> 00:40:07,190
claim to and and the Senate decided

535
00:40:07,190 --> 00:40:14,190
market to branch into one and 2009

536
00:40:17,510 --> 00:40:21,230
because a the space is limited I have to
combine

537
00:40:21,230 --> 00:40:25,080
some a similar Palin 21

538
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:28,450
one block like the BS

539
00:40:28,450 --> 00:40:32,480
the escapees at 12 11 at the end up

540
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:37,730
the year 2009 and here I i likey

541
00:40:37,730 --> 00:40:41,859
the operation name there are 14

542
00:40:41,859 --> 00:40:44,980
each year when one thing to

543
00:40:44,980 --> 00:40:48,830
choice case then

544
00:40:48,830 --> 00:40:53,300
ego XP star one mission

545
00:40:53,300 --> 00:41:00,300
2013 way case

546
00:41:13,410 --> 00:41:19,000
yet think that's all

547
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:23,319
and a by the way this might be

548
00:41:23,319 --> 00:41:30,319
and assessed

549
00:41:40,230 --> 00:41:43,590
now

550
00:41:43,590 --> 00:41:48,790
or what pool knowing that situation a
lot

551
00:41:48,790 --> 00:41:52,540
because I because I'm

552
00:41:52,540 --> 00:41:56,490
apart my job base dedicated to the
engine development so

553
00:41:56,490 --> 00:41:59,980
I have a limited time to going going

554
00:41:59,980 --> 00:42:04,790
the into this richer research a trace
star from last year March

555
00:42:04,790 --> 00:42:08,400
wires until a 10 2 months ago

556
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:11,410
before I summit the proposal to the
blackout

557
00:42:11,410 --> 00:42:14,700
it's a long way

558
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:18,560
and that because at the reason I

559
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:21,830
going so it because I also I'll

560
00:42:21,830 --> 00:42:26,280
IOC's myself so many questions so I can
continue into

561
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:29,940
Paul something interesting sherry thick
ice

562
00:42:29,940 --> 00:42:34,030
1

563
00:42:34,030 --> 00:42:41,030
yes

564
00:42:41,910 --> 00:42:43,960
I actually did I'll

565
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:47,190
you might you may dread of other when
there's

566
00:42:47,190 --> 00:42:50,380
reports say acting or anonymous

567
00:42:50,380 --> 00:42:53,530
in behind this but I wouldn't say
anything about

568
00:42:53,530 --> 00:42:56,670
who behind this because I don't have
solid

569
00:42:56,670 --> 00:43:01,050
evidence to Scholl who's behind this

570
00:43:01,050 --> 00:43:05,170
because it's a paradox right you it just
like I

571
00:43:05,170 --> 00:43:12,170
it's like ask anonymous who you are and
what

572
00:43:22,020 --> 00:43:25,400
now okay thank you guys in
