1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:03,389
so this is not about privacy any user

2
00:00:03,389 --> 00:00:09,170
data privacy so privacy is gotten a lot
of attention recently

3
00:00:09,170 --> 00:00:13,110
no specially after the Snowdon
revelations last summer

4
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:17,020
arm but they're not alone over

5
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:20,460
technical people with experience doing
privacy

6
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:25,160
so it did it's ending up that all the
security people in

7
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:29,609
end up doing privacy and this makes a
lot of sense because a big part of

8
00:00:29,609 --> 00:00:30,689
privacy

9
00:00:30,689 --> 00:00:34,100
is earth securing the user data but

10
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:37,910
there are some other aspects privacy
also an

11
00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:41,450
basically this talk is about and those
aspects

12
00:00:41,450 --> 00:00:45,420
so in particular

13
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:48,750
I'll be talking about privacy by design

14
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:53,289
so this is a methodology that originated
the 1990s

15
00:00:53,289 --> 00:00:57,289
an a at this point its

16
00:00:57,289 --> 00:01:02,960
it's pretty much the most popular and
regulatory approved way

17
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:06,570
up doing a promising engineering home

18
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:11,030
its it's basically a set of principles
which will talk about in detail more

19
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:14,200
burn basically most to them will will be

20
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:18,049
will make a licence the security people
but there are a couple that

21
00:01:18,049 --> 00:01:22,520
may not be so familiar ansel basically
in this talk will talk about those

22
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:23,360
aspects

23
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:28,030
sold as far as well will be

24
00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:31,570
covering first I wanna so the described

25
00:01:31,570 --> 00:01:36,850
or compare security versus privacy I'm
in a way to emphasize why

26
00:01:36,850 --> 00:01:40,119
privacy is a little bit different okay
then I'll talk about

27
00:01:40,119 --> 00:01:43,540
own personal information a PIII because

28
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:47,350
it's hard to talk about privacy and not
talk about these terms

29
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:51,070
K and then finally we can the privacy by
design

30
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:56,119
so first security versus privacy

31
00:01:56,119 --> 00:02:00,820
so in the usual set up for security

32
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:04,329
right there's alice is communicating
Obama

33
00:02:04,329 --> 00:02:07,790
and bar could be a server another person
are

34
00:02:07,790 --> 00:02:10,810
or even hard drive right that you're
writing to him

35
00:02:10,810 --> 00:02:14,910
and a the the usual week set up at least

36
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:20,480
cryptographically is that bob if alice
is reading one bit of information

37
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:24,180
on the ideas that the attacker should
not be able to

38
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:27,420
guess this bit with more than 50 percent
accuracy

39
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:31,030
okay if you've done that then you've
done a good job security wise

40
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:34,670
so im privacy

41
00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:38,450
um he still have the the the same

42
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:43,430
basic setup right you have this attacker
whose China snoop communication changer

43
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:46,860
breaking the system's um but their

44
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:50,060
other entities you need to consider also
cell

45
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:54,459
these entities are not necessarily
attackers

46
00:02:54,459 --> 00:02:58,489
in the militia sense right but it's
helpful to model them

47
00:02:58,489 --> 00:03:02,110
as a adversaries because you usually
China women

48
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:05,970
the amount of information that they no
metal I put in

49
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:09,550
intel up here because I i worked for
Intel in it

50
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:14,269
in if you're doing privacy love the time
you're trying to

51
00:03:14,269 --> 00:03:17,540
couldn't figure out what your work you
can infer

52
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:20,590
about the data your company collects
about its users

53
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:24,040
page seldom 'em

54
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:28,799
okay so for example we might want to

55
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:32,530
a try to figure out whether we can infer
the identity of a user

56
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:36,379
from the data we collect them and these

57
00:03:36,379 --> 00:03:40,739
inferences right are not necessarily

58
00:03:40,739 --> 00:03:43,750
too easy right so for instance a few
years back

59
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:48,090
who would have thought that if you
collect the browser user agent

60
00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:52,530
you know the time zone screen resolution

61
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:56,170
that with these kinds of data you can
actually identify the device

62
00:03:56,170 --> 00:04:00,989
so this is an example the kinda
inference that you can get from

63
00:04:00,989 --> 00:04:05,670
collecting data um because im

64
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:09,580
these kinds of inferences red which are
often

65
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:13,450
you know machine learned the the tools
of the trade for privacy

66
00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:18,169
are things like statistics data mining
machine learning

67
00:04:18,169 --> 00:04:21,600
'em and at missus in addition ride to
the

68
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:25,930
traditional tools of security
cryptography on

69
00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:29,729
K still

70
00:04:29,729 --> 00:04:33,949
what makes third in French problem maybe
a little harder

71
00:04:33,949 --> 00:04:38,870
or may be much harder is that often
don't know what Heather knowledge

72
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:41,910
the the the the adversary has

73
00:04:41,910 --> 00:04:45,880
so for instance it if you collect data
that her

74
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:49,280
some users check as says he his

75
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:53,259
at school um you probably don't know
really worry is

76
00:04:53,259 --> 00:04:58,870
but if you also know he's you know from
singaporean you know is approximate age

77
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:02,300
then there's probably a not so long list
of places he might be

78
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:05,830
I buddy also if he also happen to know
his soda

79
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:08,970
little region within Singapore then you
can probably

80
00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:14,020
have a pretty good idea where he's at
okay so the auxiliary knowledge that

81
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:17,320
this adversary has kinda influences

82
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:22,940
made to a great deal worth I'm kinda
intrinsic image

83
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:29,039
um see

84
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:33,520
still likewise

85
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:38,120
your when when you build a product or
service these days there are

86
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:41,550
it's it's rarely in isolation right
usually musings

87
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:45,270
the service providers are infrastructure
providers are partners

88
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:49,360
in you have to understand what they know
about you used to

89
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:53,199
so few using a Google Maps plugin what
is Google

90
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:56,600
learning about your users location users
for that

91
00:05:56,600 --> 00:06:00,580
you should consider also I on

92
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:06,630
and finally you have to sort it explain
all this to Alice

93
00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:10,360
so what data you're collecting what
inferences are possible

94
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:13,620
in security writer you remember that
year

95
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:17,830
alice is basically trying to communicate
nothing to the attacker and nothing

96
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:23,660
is kinda easy to understand but from
privacy you're trying to keep your china

97
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:26,960
actually communicate some non-trivial
data cell

98
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:30,840
China communicators this to the user
introduces you know

99
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:33,960
human-computer interface problems it
it's more

100
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:37,759
involved in with security

101
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:42,009
so I don't so this is a little bit of an
exaggeration this comparison right

102
00:06:42,009 --> 00:06:43,370
because and security

103
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:47,259
there's also inferences you can make to
so for instance

104
00:06:47,259 --> 00:06:50,880
even though you don't know anything
about the content up to communication

105
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:51,270
you know

106
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:55,220
when he was sent so maybe on the bases
and when I was saying you can deduce

107
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:56,240
things

108
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:00,860
but am I would argue that the the kinds
of inferences the inference problems

109
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:06,419
her I'm a greater had a greater scale
privacy

110
00:07:06,419 --> 00:07:09,569
okay so that that's enough about those
who are the basic

111
00:07:09,569 --> 00:07:13,370
setup NY her privacy introduces constant

112
00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:18,740
new things to worry about um now let's
talk about personal information

113
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:22,090
more as in the US is often called

114
00:07:22,090 --> 00:07:26,870
PIII her personally identifiable
information

115
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:29,990
okay so what is this this is

116
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:34,780
um the in the asian-pacific economic

117
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:38,210
cooperation center in Singapore will use
their definition

118
00:07:38,210 --> 00:07:41,550
okay any information about an
indemnified

119
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:45,590
or identifiable individual so

120
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:49,280
Heather organizations around the world
will have similar definitions are all

121
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,150
pretty much

122
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:53,710
the same I'm what this means is things
like

123
00:07:53,710 --> 00:07:57,099
you know you can use biometrics
birthdate

124
00:07:57,099 --> 00:08:00,669
I'm name address credit card number to
identify somebody

125
00:08:00,669 --> 00:08:05,639
the any information attached to that
identifying information

126
00:08:05,639 --> 00:08:09,479
um would also be considered personal
information

127
00:08:09,479 --> 00:08:13,500
and an important point here is that it
doesn't matter how trivial this other

128
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:15,210
information is

129
00:08:15,210 --> 00:08:19,250
on I could be like a Micah you don't
like ice cream

130
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:23,250
I but once attached to some identifying

131
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:26,599
right it's considered personal
information because it's shouldn't be

132
00:08:26,599 --> 00:08:28,569
helped to anybody to

133
00:08:28,569 --> 00:08:32,649
define what is personal to you or not
right you may simply not want other

134
00:08:32,649 --> 00:08:34,019
people to know

135
00:08:34,019 --> 00:08:38,880
you know your ice cream preferences on a
until the concentration on

136
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:43,430
this this idea personal information is
not high on the kinda data attached

137
00:08:43,430 --> 00:08:47,029
to the slowdown ways to identify
somebody but

138
00:08:47,029 --> 00:08:52,720
on these ways to identify some leeway so
these identifiers

139
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:57,120
so the problem is um

140
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:00,200
if you think about this definition right
you

141
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:05,830
used kinda realize eventually that to
there's some problems with it

142
00:09:05,830 --> 00:09:09,120
what does identifiable really mean

143
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:13,130
troll troll for one thing the copter the
usual model

144
00:09:13,130 --> 00:09:16,990
you have in mind is somebody goes to the
data that we collect from somebody and

145
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:19,060
says well this is

146
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:23,380
personal information you know this is
not you know is not sensitive is not

147
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:27,120
but um that really doesn't work right
because

148
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:30,339
whether something his identifiable had

149
00:09:30,339 --> 00:09:35,970
to an individual depends on all the data
so if you consider device fingerprints

150
00:09:35,970 --> 00:09:39,380
if you look at any those pieces of data
and in isolation to

151
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:43,470
its kinda binoculars but only if you
take everything together

152
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:46,740
has actually identify somebody right um

153
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:50,760
so he identifiable depends on all the
data that you click to rate

154
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:54,500
not just you know a few fields another
thing

155
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:59,450
is that term it depends on what
auxiliary data you hanan

156
00:09:59,450 --> 00:10:03,260
so you may have the name and address
okay so that's clearly

157
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:07,450
personal information but suppose you
have and identify your

158
00:10:07,450 --> 00:10:11,410
I and this in Sunday to attach to that
identify your

159
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:16,010
and then identifiers in some third party
proprietary database

160
00:10:16,010 --> 00:10:20,140
attest to a name and address so
presumably you don't really have

161
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:23,940
easy access to this other database right
so

162
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:28,890
is a considered identifiable I mean
somebody could identify and for it but

163
00:10:28,890 --> 00:10:31,940
you you can tell he's not so easily

164
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:35,860
on cell is a considered

165
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:40,170
personal information unclear right cell

166
00:10:40,170 --> 00:10:43,910
the the argument I'm trying to make is
that this this idea

167
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:47,740
personal information RPI is a construct

168
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:51,329
based in policy in law it's not a
technical construct

169
00:10:51,329 --> 00:10:55,350
and technically in fact it doesn't make
any sense okay so

170
00:10:55,350 --> 00:10:59,470
from firm for us the the on a technical
side

171
00:10:59,470 --> 00:11:02,940
so I would encourage you guys to forget
about

172
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:08,000
you know arm personally the idea
personal information

173
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,370
I am lemme does

174
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:18,040
and this little section with the closed
from Narayanganj Monica of these are two

175
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:22,120
so the privacy security researchers they
need

176
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:25,740
they're basically said they say it
better than me

177
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:30,360
rates basically people who try to go
into a collection of data and so to pick

178
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:31,269
out

179
00:11:31,269 --> 00:11:34,990
what is considered personal or not is
this just not the right way to go

180
00:11:34,990 --> 00:11:38,640
yet again holiday to at once

181
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:42,510
hmmm okay if you accept

182
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:46,390
what I'm saying personal information as
it is so that not

183
00:11:46,390 --> 00:11:49,490
exactly what you want to look at as a
technical person then what do you do

184
00:11:49,490 --> 00:11:50,790
about

185
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:54,950
all your company policies about personal
information P II

186
00:11:54,950 --> 00:12:00,360
because com for instance I work for
Intel and Intel a certain policies that

187
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:01,740
you have to handle

188
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:06,360
you know PI in a certain way you have
the treated in a certain way

189
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:09,610
so how do you do that if you can even
define it on

190
00:12:09,610 --> 00:12:13,070
well here's one suggestion %uh

191
00:12:13,070 --> 00:12:16,220
you can take a you can take a risk
management approach

192
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:20,800
so basically the risk have a piece a
personal information depends on

193
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:25,420
how easy it is to make the
identification with an actual individual

194
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:29,310
and how sensitive it is right sold
together

195
00:12:29,310 --> 00:12:32,750
you can sort of evaluate the risk have a
certain piece and Aiden

196
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:35,910
so if you if you know the risk have
their data

197
00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:38,950
then you can't really compare it with up

198
00:12:38,950 --> 00:12:43,470
other day to have similar risk and they
should be handled the same way

199
00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:47,290
until then this way you might sidestep

200
00:12:47,290 --> 00:12:49,930
the question of whether you wanna
declare something as personal

201
00:12:49,930 --> 00:12:51,290
information on

202
00:12:51,290 --> 00:12:56,130
thats moreover a legal policy issue the
more on a technical side

203
00:12:56,130 --> 00:13:00,130
on we just take a risk management
approach

204
00:13:00,130 --> 00:13:03,610
okay um

205
00:13:03,610 --> 00:13:08,529
okay so now we've talked about this this
PI or personal data question which

206
00:13:08,529 --> 00:13:14,070
for comes up in your privacy now finally
let's talk about privacy by design

207
00:13:14,070 --> 00:13:19,720
so production privacy by design is
basically a set of principles

208
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:22,950
and these principles her were based

209
00:13:22,950 --> 00:13:26,389
Honda fair Information practice
principles

210
00:13:26,389 --> 00:13:30,709
which which to revision aid in the
nineteen seventies

211
00:13:30,709 --> 00:13:34,940
back in the nineteen seventies the US
Department of Health Education and

212
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:36,700
Welfare formed on

213
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:40,699
small commission to look at the
consequences on father's

214
00:13:40,699 --> 00:13:43,889
electronic data I was coming into being

215
00:13:43,889 --> 00:13:46,990
so the Commission

216
00:13:46,990 --> 00:13:51,600
came up with five what they call the
Fair Information practice principles

217
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:55,060
and let me just tell you about those
because they're actually pretty easy to

218
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:57,570
understand and they're very intuitive

219
00:13:57,570 --> 00:14:01,500
'em the first one is that you know the
usual should know about the data

220
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:02,459
collection

221
00:14:02,459 --> 00:14:06,600
if you're collecting data from user you
should should know about it

222
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:09,899
the user should be able to see the data
collected so if you're collecting

223
00:14:09,899 --> 00:14:11,240
information about

224
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:14,560
from somebody he should be able to come
back to you and say okay show me what

225
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:15,750
you got

226
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:20,010
okay 'em the data should only be used
for that

227
00:14:20,010 --> 00:14:24,139
use that was collected for so usually
you tell the user

228
00:14:24,139 --> 00:14:27,279
why you're collecting the data and you
shouldn't use it for some other purpose

229
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:28,440
obviously

230
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:32,389
home the user can correct

231
00:14:32,389 --> 00:14:36,610
or amend or delete the data that you
have on him

232
00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:39,949
okay as the fourth principle in the last
one is them

233
00:14:39,949 --> 00:14:43,459
basically the data should be secured

234
00:14:43,459 --> 00:14:47,490
in those days they used to rid the term
reliable

235
00:14:47,490 --> 00:14:51,480
basically you wanna make sure the data
stored securely reliably

236
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:55,709
in people can't first come in and miss
misuses

237
00:14:55,709 --> 00:15:00,170
so those by the original Fair
Information practice principles from the

238
00:15:00,170 --> 00:15:01,570
1970s

239
00:15:01,570 --> 00:15:05,810
um so after a few years there are other
bodies

240
00:15:05,810 --> 00:15:10,709
you know governmental bodies from
different places not just the US but

241
00:15:10,709 --> 00:15:14,660
Europe in particular with which they
took these very Information practice

242
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:15,850
principles and

243
00:15:15,850 --> 00:15:19,920
in augmented them a little bit made them
in the policy and eventually

244
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:23,440
long in a lot of places

245
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:26,970
so privacy by design builds on those
principles

246
00:15:26,970 --> 00:15:31,570
okay on I won't I won't go into all
seven

247
00:15:31,570 --> 00:15:35,029
these privacy by design principles
because you can easily

248
00:15:35,029 --> 00:15:38,850
find information about these on the air
on the web

249
00:15:38,850 --> 00:15:42,310
instead done I'm gonna try to give you
three

250
00:15:42,310 --> 00:15:46,829
soda guidelines basically on how you
learn

251
00:15:46,829 --> 00:15:50,199
do privacy by design

252
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:53,350
so them the first guideline

253
00:15:53,350 --> 00:15:58,009
his is the is the day to secure okay so
this is one of the key

254
00:15:58,009 --> 00:16:01,829
aspects a privacy by design in as I said
before

255
00:16:01,829 --> 00:16:06,250
censuses a.m. security ID as we probably
don't need to worry im

256
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:09,970
I mean at least worry about this too
much for basically this is whether

257
00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:15,410
the data flows and you're getting are
actually today employs You're Expecting

258
00:16:15,410 --> 00:16:19,480
so I want a more about this one this one

259
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:23,589
we're going to cover down a few examples
little later on we basically had we

260
00:16:23,589 --> 00:16:24,600
minimized

261
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:29,100
the data that we collect and minimize
means that come

262
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:32,250
week we should collect more then

263
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:35,690
what we really need and that's the

264
00:16:35,690 --> 00:16:39,860
on that that's that's a little bit hard
in this day

265
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:43,670
love arm collecting holiday to you know
about

266
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:48,519
you can get from somebody in order to
may be targeted advertisement to 'em

267
00:16:48,519 --> 00:16:53,820
are or something like that and but but
the philosophy is you shouldn't get

268
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:57,250
more than you really need and you can
keep in longer than you need to

269
00:16:57,250 --> 00:17:00,740
right turn after after a certain amount
of time

270
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:04,169
if it's not give is not have any you
should too scary 11

271
00:17:04,169 --> 00:17:09,669
okay so this is basically dead at data
minimisation

272
00:17:09,669 --> 00:17:13,829
died I number three does the user
understand

273
00:17:13,829 --> 00:17:17,500
so the word the word transparency

274
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:20,679
you often hear with respect the privacy
well

275
00:17:20,679 --> 00:17:24,650
we are transparent well what is a what
does it mean if you're not

276
00:17:24,650 --> 00:17:28,799
if if I'm sitting good if there's a
window which is transparent but I'm not

277
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:30,980
looking through it it doesn't really
help me

278
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:35,299
so if a company in has transparent

279
00:17:35,299 --> 00:17:38,990
policies doesn't really help these are
never looks at a right

280
00:17:38,990 --> 00:17:43,100
um so I wanna I don't use the word
transparency here

281
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:47,370
the user the goal is really to make
these understand what's going on

282
00:17:47,370 --> 00:17:51,470
what kind of data is being collected
know why is being collected

283
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:54,799
you know and what what the retention
policy is things like this

284
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:58,070
he really has to understand is not says
that he is able to understand

285
00:17:58,070 --> 00:18:01,700
if he you know does certain things

286
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:05,770
at least have to go

287
00:18:05,770 --> 00:18:08,919
okay so let's talk about

288
00:18:08,919 --> 00:18:13,559
data minimisation first I'm gonna give
you up two examples

289
00:18:13,559 --> 00:18:17,419
right then I'm gonna talk about
anonymization

290
00:18:17,419 --> 00:18:22,000
which is kinda way to do data
minimisation

291
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,770
you try to d personalized data by
removing any trace have any

292
00:18:25,770 --> 00:18:28,900
particular person so

293
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:32,559
the first example is on

294
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:35,700
has to do with ID's

295
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:40,160
so whenever you hear them whenever you
hear about ideas should be a red flag

296
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,179
for you

297
00:18:41,179 --> 00:18:44,460
okay ID's in and a couple other terms
that will

298
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:47,530
get to solution one understand one

299
00:18:47,530 --> 00:18:50,919
his associate with that ID because I
these are away to glue

300
00:18:50,919 --> 00:18:54,110
information together right if you have
an ID that

301
00:18:54,110 --> 00:18:57,480
could thats persistent for user you can
attach

302
00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:02,460
data that I D over a period of time and
eventually you get to know me better

303
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:05,830
in better picture at the user's habits
in

304
00:19:05,830 --> 00:19:10,410
you know when he's like what he does on

305
00:19:10,410 --> 00:19:16,270
ID's can be you know confined to one
company or go across companies

306
00:19:16,270 --> 00:19:20,340
so for instance Apple's advertiser I D

307
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:25,809
Apple's advertiser ID great you with his
men too soon to be shared among

308
00:19:25,809 --> 00:19:29,510
you know a group love entities

309
00:19:29,510 --> 00:19:33,299
and so that's kinda even more dangerous
in a sense because

310
00:19:33,299 --> 00:19:37,559
you've collected data corresponding this
ID some other

311
00:19:37,559 --> 00:19:41,520
entity is collected data if this date is
a merged

312
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:45,510
what inferences are possible as is not
clear

313
00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:49,190
and so

314
00:19:49,190 --> 00:19:54,490
so basically you would like to arm try
to disconnect the data whenever possible

315
00:19:54,490 --> 00:19:55,660
for privacy

316
00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:59,440
so if you're trying to maintain privacy
you want your data into little pieces

317
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:01,380
that are not collect connected

318
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:06,520
you don't want it all in one big one
they can be easily analyzed pain

319
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:10,220
sold the one example of this is a

320
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:15,200
Google's decision a couple years back to
sort emerged

321
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:18,490
all the data from his various services
in

322
00:20:18,490 --> 00:20:22,970
if you remember that caused a big
privacy up right people don't like that

323
00:20:22,970 --> 00:20:23,530
because

324
00:20:23,530 --> 00:20:28,490
now all this on google has merged your
injury data in your search data and

325
00:20:28,490 --> 00:20:32,020
mean any other data that you use from
them enters are the one big pile

326
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:37,049
and she can imagine that they get a much
better picture view because emerges data

327
00:20:37,049 --> 00:20:40,100
so so it's a problem with ID's

328
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:45,440
okay

329
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:48,500
now I'll give you a simple example

330
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:51,830
Nov data minimisation ID's

331
00:20:51,830 --> 00:20:54,940
I was involved in a project where

332
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:58,590
we're collecting data for
troubleshooting and I it not

333
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:04,020
diagnostics from devices okay that there
was a need to so don't correlate data

334
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:08,750
from the same device I in order so to
figure out what was going on

335
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:12,460
on but the key point was that

336
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:16,280
this correlation only needed to be local
on-time

337
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:19,330
so for instance if you collect data

338
00:21:19,330 --> 00:21:23,289
from the same device there was a week
apart you didn't really need no news

339
00:21:23,289 --> 00:21:24,679
from the same device

340
00:21:24,679 --> 00:21:28,520
but if he collected his data you know
those on our part

341
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:33,740
then it was quite useful to know that
this this data came from the same device

342
00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:38,470
okay so given so that need what we did
was we

343
00:21:38,470 --> 00:21:42,049
periodically change the identifiers
right so we would

344
00:21:42,049 --> 00:21:45,549
upload data from the device with and
identify your

345
00:21:45,549 --> 00:21:49,669
and then every few days we will change
that identifying the device will change

346
00:21:49,669 --> 00:21:51,080
it on identifying

347
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:54,140
down this way we get so there's local
correlation

348
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:57,400
what's going on but that we've

349
00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:02,289
to enhance the user's privacy because
that we can't get

350
00:22:02,289 --> 00:22:05,409
right her long record in or

351
00:22:05,409 --> 00:22:09,490
keep gathering data on the same on the
user cuz every

352
00:22:09,490 --> 00:22:12,740
X 10 champa data that we gather about a
particular

353
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:15,990
no user is homie make a few days long

354
00:22:15,990 --> 00:22:20,820
so this way which or to minimize the
data depict based on our need

355
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:24,580
so it's a simple example uva minimizing
Dana

356
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:28,309
on here's another example

357
00:22:28,309 --> 00:22:32,110
it has to do with a location

358
00:22:32,110 --> 00:22:35,590
now location is another one of those
terms that if you hear it he should you

359
00:22:35,590 --> 00:22:38,600
should immediately perk up and say all
right with what is going on with

360
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:43,059
with that on location is very useful for

361
00:22:43,059 --> 00:22:46,390
mobile app strain but at the same time
right it's

362
00:22:46,390 --> 00:22:49,730
10 most sensitive things about you

363
00:22:49,730 --> 00:22:54,750
your location so the scenario the
scenario is that there's a

364
00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:58,400
has a website or app that incorporates
this

365
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:01,400
you want to use this third-party Weather
Service

366
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:04,840
you don't wanna go to the trouble
yourself to build the service on a

367
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:08,010
Weather Service who use a third-party
Weather Service

368
00:23:08,010 --> 00:23:11,799
this weather service you give any a
location

369
00:23:11,799 --> 00:23:15,710
energy back maybe the weather in a
location probably the forecast to

370
00:23:15,710 --> 00:23:19,429
okay um

371
00:23:19,429 --> 00:23:22,620
you can easily find a bunch of the
services on the Internet

372
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:28,309
it because it's obviously useful thing

373
00:23:28,309 --> 00:23:33,140
so you wouldn't naturally not give

374
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:37,370
the user who request the location to
request the weather

375
00:23:37,370 --> 00:23:41,970
you wouldn't give his user ID to the
weather service rate you adjust um

376
00:23:41,970 --> 00:23:45,100
give the weather service a location

377
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:48,929
I on unmarked with the user ID

378
00:23:48,929 --> 00:23:52,059
and sell the the pics you get

379
00:23:52,059 --> 00:23:55,240
for the weather service might be
something like this right he just gets a

380
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:56,409
bunch showed

381
00:23:56,409 --> 00:23:59,809
so marks for some user requested

382
00:23:59,809 --> 00:24:03,799
though the weather at this location

383
00:24:03,799 --> 00:24:06,890
n you may think well

384
00:24:06,890 --> 00:24:09,900
this is OK I missed that should be okay

385
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:14,720
um the question is does does anything
like this ever happen

386
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:19,100
does the weather service ever see
something like this

387
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:23,590
where that the center queries the sort
have obviously corresponding to one

388
00:24:23,590 --> 00:24:24,909
person

389
00:24:24,909 --> 00:24:28,820
and if you get the location for one
person

390
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:33,400
on you can pretty much newbie you know a
lot about a person really know where he

391
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:33,960
lives

392
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:37,580
because you know where he sleeps at
night you know his head that's what he

393
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:40,890
does during the day I mean you you know
a lot if he can get his location which

394
00:24:40,890 --> 00:24:45,320
trace so the question is does this
happen

395
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:49,730
can this happen with for with if you're
using this third party location service

396
00:24:49,730 --> 00:24:54,000
I mean Weather Service intuitively you
might think well

397
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:58,320
there so many users right dish shouldn't
happen because

398
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:03,309
you know I mean all the users patterns
will be sort of on top of each other in

399
00:25:03,309 --> 00:25:05,250
your bill to discern any pattern

400
00:25:05,250 --> 00:25:09,250
like this um that might be true

401
00:25:09,250 --> 00:25:13,960
how do we figure out whether it might
happen or not well

402
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:17,809
must look good an analogous

403
00:25:17,809 --> 00:25:20,820
sorta situation

404
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:24,000
Twitter users so there a while back

405
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:28,270
there was a a demographic study 'em
Twitter when they tried to figure out

406
00:25:28,270 --> 00:25:32,320
each county in the US what percent

407
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:37,029
%uh use Twitter so hit

408
00:25:37,029 --> 00:25:40,409
this is a scatterplot a up what they
found

409
00:25:40,409 --> 00:25:43,659
so if you look at the come the bottom

410
00:25:43,659 --> 00:25:46,760
left hand corner

411
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:49,789
there's a diagonal there that diagonal

412
00:25:49,789 --> 00:25:55,500
I represents counties where there was
only one Twitter user

413
00:25:55,500 --> 00:26:00,490
so in other words the distribution of
Twitter users is such that there are

414
00:26:00,490 --> 00:26:01,830
counties

415
00:26:01,830 --> 00:26:05,010
where these each with these where their

416
00:26:05,010 --> 00:26:08,010
new really geographically isolated users

417
00:26:08,010 --> 00:26:11,179
and this is 3.2 million users okay so

418
00:26:11,179 --> 00:26:15,080
um missus some evidence right to

419
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:18,169
argue that you know it could happen

420
00:26:18,169 --> 00:26:24,520
if if you're in some situation where I
do not many users near you

421
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:29,130
I and in Twitter even in Twitter it
happens right millions of users

422
00:26:29,130 --> 00:26:33,919
um you might be in a situation where
geographically isolated

423
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:37,220
if you geographically isolated um

424
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:40,340
you might be tracked film

425
00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:44,340
what do you do about that a well

426
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:47,470
you can just make the observation that
whether right

427
00:26:47,470 --> 00:26:51,809
doesn't really depend on your exact
location

428
00:26:51,809 --> 00:26:56,120
I mean you're him your weather only
depends on side your course location

429
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:59,970
I mean it's not gonna change within the
city too much so maybe you don't need to

430
00:26:59,970 --> 00:27:00,580
give

431
00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:04,159
your exact location to the weather
service you give some soda course very

432
00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:04,940
coarse

433
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:09,120
maybe a grid coordinate or something to
the to the weather service

434
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:12,980
and that's good enough forgetting the
weather right if you do then

435
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:17,289
then you sorta reduced this

436
00:27:17,289 --> 00:27:22,399
problem up the well love them Weather
Service Order Tracking your users

437
00:27:22,399 --> 00:27:25,750
so this is another example months on a
minimization

438
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:29,440
okay because you don't really need to
give something

439
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:34,370
he you try not to give it

440
00:27:34,370 --> 00:27:37,779
okay so now let me talk about the

441
00:27:37,779 --> 00:27:44,020
anonymization anonymization is this

442
00:27:44,020 --> 00:27:47,130
really attractive idea writer you

443
00:27:47,130 --> 00:27:50,840
you don't you're afraid I love this this
data that you have

444
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:54,090
you know becoming getting into the wrong
hands are

445
00:27:54,090 --> 00:27:59,470
or whatever so to help with privacy
concerns you anonymizer

446
00:27:59,470 --> 00:28:03,700
than the Minish no problem on so for
instance

447
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:07,799
Google when Yahoo after a certain amount
a month

448
00:28:07,799 --> 00:28:12,029
they claim they anonymizer search data

449
00:28:12,029 --> 00:28:15,059
and they don't think that they tell us
what they do but

450
00:28:15,059 --> 00:28:20,240
um they the they've said something about
you know you do something the IP may be

451
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,159
truncated

452
00:28:21,159 --> 00:28:25,210
and then a maybe some other things but
we they did they really haven't said

453
00:28:25,210 --> 00:28:28,899
but they claim to basically anonymized
research data

454
00:28:28,899 --> 00:28:33,830
so this is done missus obviously
attracted from the privacy point of view

455
00:28:33,830 --> 00:28:37,010
but you know

456
00:28:37,010 --> 00:28:41,220
its non-trivial to do it on a position
in this is one

457
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:44,309
if there's a few points you want to take
away from the talk

458
00:28:44,309 --> 00:28:47,390
provinces 1 a.m. anonymization is not
easy

459
00:28:47,390 --> 00:28:52,620
okay and were good in order we're gonna
like see some examples

460
00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:56,260
in a sec okay but to is an important
point

461
00:28:56,260 --> 00:29:00,039
so must take a look at location data
Excel

462
00:29:00,039 --> 00:29:03,100
if you just take away the ID from a
location trace

463
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:07,210
obviously you can get the guys idid you
know where he sleeps

464
00:29:07,210 --> 00:29:10,710
you might have a fun well let's just cut
away some of those

465
00:29:10,710 --> 00:29:14,419
points you know cutaway where %um where
he

466
00:29:14,419 --> 00:29:18,890
daniel is home maybe cutaway some other
points and maybe that's good enough

467
00:29:18,890 --> 00:29:22,309
%uh the last year

468
00:29:22,309 --> 00:29:26,690
there are some there some researchers
from MIT who look at this

469
00:29:26,690 --> 00:29:30,890
mobile phone data set about 1.5 million
users

470
00:29:30,890 --> 00:29:34,100
an they'd found that just four

471
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:37,350
data points was enough to identify a
user

472
00:29:37,350 --> 00:29:41,740
so basically you're your mobility
patterns how you move around

473
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:45,220
is the sauna very identifying
characteristic

474
00:29:45,220 --> 00:29:48,950
so it's very hard try to just sorta um

475
00:29:48,950 --> 00:29:52,409
remove data points in in order to try to
Nana mines

476
00:29:52,409 --> 00:29:55,529
you might have the thought to a

477
00:29:55,529 --> 00:29:59,049
course send the data like we did with
the

478
00:29:59,049 --> 00:30:02,659
the weather the weather service right
instead of instead of %uh sending the

479
00:30:02,659 --> 00:30:05,470
exact keeping exact location use Cookies

480
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:09,779
keep sort of a course in variation home

481
00:30:09,779 --> 00:30:13,529
you can't do then in a might work if you
do it

482
00:30:13,529 --> 00:30:17,049
in a course enough way alright but you
may lose

483
00:30:17,049 --> 00:30:21,149
why you're keeping it in the first place
right because Butner

484
00:30:21,149 --> 00:30:25,320
others give you one Heather sorta
well-known result

485
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:28,409
a Philippe go away incurred partridge

486
00:30:28,409 --> 00:30:32,140
I guess this was number five years back
they're looking at

487
00:30:32,140 --> 00:30:35,480
down this Chris census data and

488
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:38,600
if you look at the zip code

489
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:42,270
when this is roughly say a thousand two
thousand people

490
00:30:42,270 --> 00:30:46,090
on up where people work

491
00:30:46,090 --> 00:30:49,809
and where people live so that that tuple
right

492
00:30:49,809 --> 00:30:55,210
there is enough to a narrow you down
into a group of 20

493
00:30:55,210 --> 00:30:58,909
so in other words in your zip code is
probably

494
00:30:58,909 --> 00:31:03,380
workers likely right only 20 other
people

495
00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:08,240
who who halsell work in the same zip
code

496
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:11,450
and this accords varies depending on you
know these are on me

497
00:31:11,450 --> 00:31:15,679
basically media figures but the idea is
that you know

498
00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:20,320
even when you course and data location
data it's kinda hard to scrub away the

499
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:24,830
home individual characteristics other so
location is the guy never

500
00:31:24,830 --> 00:31:28,510
hard thing to depersonalize search data

501
00:31:28,510 --> 00:31:33,149
okay we a this this picture hears from
the new york times while back you

502
00:31:33,149 --> 00:31:34,299
probably heard us but

503
00:31:34,299 --> 00:31:39,029
basically a New York Times reporter
managed to DN undermines the data

504
00:31:39,029 --> 00:31:43,070
there wasn't even a computer science
researcher I it was just a reporter who

505
00:31:43,070 --> 00:31:47,429
looked at research data and say well
okay

506
00:31:47,429 --> 00:31:51,250
um again it's its kinda

507
00:31:51,250 --> 00:31:55,730
it kinda difficult turn it's through it
would seem kinda difficult to

508
00:31:55,730 --> 00:32:00,260
anonymous search data although you know
going you know who claim they are doing

509
00:32:00,260 --> 00:32:01,059
in

510
00:32:01,059 --> 00:32:04,700
home okay

511
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:07,669
and I'm gonna give you a few more
examples right just to drive this point

512
00:32:07,669 --> 00:32:08,080
home

513
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:11,590
probably you you purdham you know only
somebody's

514
00:32:11,590 --> 00:32:15,190
this this X this example

515
00:32:15,190 --> 00:32:20,350
have fun were tonya sweeney discovering
the Massachusetts governor's

516
00:32:20,350 --> 00:32:25,070
hospital visits is another famous
example solar tonya Sweeney was a

517
00:32:25,070 --> 00:32:28,130
CMU graduate student and

518
00:32:28,130 --> 00:32:31,450
there the Insurance Commission

519
00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:35,220
other state a Massachusetts release
these anonymized

520
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:38,710
you know hospital visits you know for
the purpose

521
00:32:38,710 --> 00:32:43,640
up let letting people like keno
analyzing data for

522
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:46,799
to make society better I guess um

523
00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:49,870
but on yes when he took this data right

524
00:32:49,870 --> 00:32:53,460
which had been anonymized by you know
we're moving name address social

525
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:54,950
security number

526
00:32:54,950 --> 00:32:58,500
and she joined it with voter records

527
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:02,429
so voter records also had things like
gender zip code birth date but also a

528
00:33:02,429 --> 00:33:03,870
name

529
00:33:03,870 --> 00:33:07,370
and it turns out you know gender zip
code birth date

530
00:33:07,370 --> 00:33:10,799
is basically and then a fire so she was
able to see that

531
00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:13,880
no look at the governor and the Senate
records and

532
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:17,409
see that even you know visited a
hospital on

533
00:33:17,409 --> 00:33:20,570
and that was I was kinda famous

534
00:33:20,570 --> 00:33:25,860
the anonymization case probably one of
the first

535
00:33:25,860 --> 00:33:29,419
um another example Isner

536
00:33:29,419 --> 00:33:33,529
the Netflix Prize dataset so this is a
dataset have

537
00:33:33,529 --> 00:33:36,809
movie ratings that Netflix

538
00:33:36,809 --> 00:33:41,590
released it's an anonymized movie
ratings and Netflix released I guess in

539
00:33:41,590 --> 00:33:42,870
about 2006

540
00:33:42,870 --> 00:33:46,399
your cell um for the purposes are
leading

541
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:49,529
researchers Anna

542
00:33:49,529 --> 00:33:54,149
experiment on them in order to prove
Netflix's recommendation algorithm

543
00:33:54,149 --> 00:33:57,190
they're offering like a million bucks if
you interested

544
00:33:57,190 --> 00:34:01,100
you improved the recommendation after
them

545
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:05,140
by more than 10 percent compared to
theirs so

546
00:34:05,140 --> 00:34:08,790
it turns out I'm afraid that you could
you can

547
00:34:08,790 --> 00:34:12,490
soda identify users and their data set

548
00:34:12,490 --> 00:34:15,560
because a the movies that they actually
rated

549
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:19,869
because the Netflix dataset like a lot
of other datasets

550
00:34:19,869 --> 00:34:24,149
Hazare long tail the movie the center
movies

551
00:34:24,149 --> 00:34:28,179
so if you choose them if you're reading
a movie

552
00:34:28,179 --> 00:34:32,560
in this long tail um they're not
relatively speaking there not many other

553
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:33,280
mood

554
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:36,710
abusers who agree to that movie right so
it's kinda

555
00:34:36,710 --> 00:34:40,700
infrequent event so if you have a few
these infrequent events

556
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:45,109
basically you can identify the user it
so this is what they call her

557
00:34:45,109 --> 00:34:49,250
them is a the problem with having a long
tail right a few of those events

558
00:34:49,250 --> 00:34:53,909
is enough to identify somebody home

559
00:34:53,909 --> 00:34:57,180
and this this got a lot of press because
a

560
00:34:57,180 --> 00:35:00,890
the the minister identify people who

561
00:35:00,890 --> 00:35:04,820
a in this other data set those public
dataset

562
00:35:04,820 --> 00:35:11,040
right Calder in the Internet Movie
Database miss Internet Movie Database

563
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:14,230
her head Associated user names to it

564
00:35:14,230 --> 00:35:17,430
and the Netflix data

565
00:35:17,430 --> 00:35:21,950
had movies that were not publicly rated
and sometimes the movies that were not

566
00:35:21,950 --> 00:35:23,420
publicly rated work I know

567
00:35:23,420 --> 00:35:28,030
potentially embarrassing and there was a
lawsuit eventually that

568
00:35:28,030 --> 00:35:32,270
some closet gay woman

569
00:35:32,270 --> 00:35:38,329
claim that from her Netflix ratings
history you can infer that she was

570
00:35:38,329 --> 00:35:42,619
homosexual and these movies movies are
not didn't exist in the

571
00:35:42,619 --> 00:35:46,710
in our public ratings so eventually
Netflix settled the suit

572
00:35:46,710 --> 00:35:50,140
right but this this was a another
example

573
00:35:50,140 --> 00:35:53,220
up you know d why anonymization

574
00:35:53,220 --> 00:35:56,339
are you would think a few movie ratings

575
00:35:56,339 --> 00:36:01,619
what's the harm but in fact you can
identify somebody from there

576
00:36:01,619 --> 00:36:04,670
finally I'll give you an arm one last
example

577
00:36:04,670 --> 00:36:08,140
graphical data so graphical data

578
00:36:08,140 --> 00:36:12,570
you can and if you can if you even if
you take away

579
00:36:12,570 --> 00:36:16,280
identifiers from the structure of the
crash

580
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:20,900
you can figure out a you can identify
somebody basically

581
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:24,050
so if you have some auxiliary draft

582
00:36:24,050 --> 00:36:28,920
dataset um say like twitter is something
as more public

583
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:33,170
you can solder match your users to that
to those users

584
00:36:33,170 --> 00:36:36,369
to serve identify them and this is what
on people

585
00:36:36,369 --> 00:36:39,869
did okay to let that enough about

586
00:36:39,869 --> 00:36:43,530
anonymization I hope I've convince you
basically it's its not

587
00:36:43,530 --> 00:36:47,369
is not a trivial thing and you should be
careful when you attempt this thing

588
00:36:47,369 --> 00:36:51,359
okay so that was the whole point about
their um supplement and Thursday the

589
00:36:51,359 --> 00:36:52,230
minimisation

590
00:36:52,230 --> 00:36:56,060
part by just saying that you know you
can see there

591
00:36:56,060 --> 00:36:59,369
the challenge in data minimisation is
that

592
00:36:59,369 --> 00:37:02,920
people on the other side are trying to
make inferences through data mining

593
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:06,740
data mining is getting you know better
and better as weak as we go on in

594
00:37:06,740 --> 00:37:12,000
there's more and more data so that the
challenges that we have to swallow

595
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:15,720
there's a tension right between data
minimisation and data mining

596
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:22,380
and this is so that the the issue in
this area

597
00:37:22,380 --> 00:37:25,740
okay on

598
00:37:25,740 --> 00:37:29,599
finally there's third topic up does the
user understands

599
00:37:29,599 --> 00:37:32,780
right this is sort of the last guideline
love

600
00:37:32,780 --> 00:37:36,980
on privacy by design

601
00:37:36,980 --> 00:37:40,020
the traditional model

602
00:37:40,020 --> 00:37:43,510
um our framework for privacy is that

603
00:37:43,510 --> 00:37:46,710
he's going to explain to the user what
you're collecting

604
00:37:46,710 --> 00:37:50,290
you know in all this and he says okay he
can sense

605
00:37:50,290 --> 00:37:54,359
so this is got the notice and consent
right and

606
00:37:54,359 --> 00:37:58,760
often it's implemented by some you know
little privacy range

607
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:02,770
maybe on on some web page you're looking
at in a few click on that link you get

608
00:38:02,770 --> 00:38:03,579
some

609
00:38:03,579 --> 00:38:07,869
something like this and how many people
have read

610
00:38:07,869 --> 00:38:13,750
Google's privacy policy completely

611
00:38:13,750 --> 00:38:17,760
but not surprising the font on this
thing a small

612
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:22,680
intentionally okay not nobody reach
these things I mean unless maybe your

613
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:26,020
pressure your professionally interested

614
00:38:26,020 --> 00:38:30,640
on there mainly for lawyers and
policymakers

615
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:35,640
right cell what happens is that the
paula and her company doesn't follow the

616
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:39,710
you know what they say they're doing
then the lawyers and policymakers can

617
00:38:39,710 --> 00:38:41,589
say hey wait a second you said you're
getting your

618
00:38:41,589 --> 00:38:44,750
exposed to do this but you not doing it

619
00:38:44,750 --> 00:38:48,750
the end users actually not really paying
too much attention to this

620
00:38:48,750 --> 00:38:52,210
right unfortunately so

621
00:38:52,210 --> 00:38:56,270
the traditional noticing consent model
is really difficult because

622
00:38:56,270 --> 00:38:59,329
how do you make the user understand he
doesn't want to understand he does want

623
00:38:59,329 --> 00:39:00,450
to do what He

624
00:39:00,450 --> 00:39:03,970
miss China do it doesn't care about your
privacy policy right

625
00:39:03,970 --> 00:39:08,430
um and that is why

626
00:39:08,430 --> 00:39:15,430
and that's why %um should do everything
you can in the area data minimisation

627
00:39:15,820 --> 00:39:19,950
in Fig in because user Guinea user
understanding is very hard

628
00:39:19,950 --> 00:39:23,730
right so you should try to like minimize
it as much as you can so

629
00:39:23,730 --> 00:39:27,630
to soda lesson the need for use our
understanding

630
00:39:27,630 --> 00:39:30,849
because he's understanding is a very
hard game and usually

631
00:39:30,849 --> 00:39:34,930
you know it's it's it's not real user
understanding it's more something so

632
00:39:34,930 --> 00:39:37,640
that the lawyers and policy makers are
happy

633
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:42,510
okay on so just too

634
00:39:42,510 --> 00:39:45,710
Salem Ore brown to give an example love

635
00:39:45,710 --> 00:39:50,339
why this is hard I'm gonna talk about
her actually Intel project

636
00:39:50,339 --> 00:39:53,670
car the the perceptual computing STK

637
00:39:53,670 --> 00:39:58,740
so this is a a bundle love two
algorithms and drivers

638
00:39:58,740 --> 00:40:02,270
that Intel is put into library and

639
00:40:02,270 --> 00:40:06,230
he can enable third-party developers to
do things like

640
00:40:06,230 --> 00:40:10,329
you know arm measure your heart rate so
using the sensors

641
00:40:10,329 --> 00:40:13,400
on your webcam he can pick up the

642
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:17,480
for minute fluctuations in your skin
tone with every heartbeat

643
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:21,280
in that way to measure your heart rate
on

644
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:24,700
selig so it enables applications like
that but of course

645
00:40:24,700 --> 00:40:28,569
a the sweater applications have

646
00:40:28,569 --> 00:40:32,040
privacy concerns right because they may
not be just things like measuring your

647
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:32,819
heart rate

648
00:40:32,819 --> 00:40:36,250
they may be capturing raw video: they
may be doing

649
00:40:36,250 --> 00:40:43,250
facial recognition things like this um

650
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:48,510
Phil how do you how do you so the
problem is how do you make the 100 the

651
00:40:48,510 --> 00:40:49,089
user

652
00:40:49,089 --> 00:40:53,220
to understand what is going on what is
the application actually doing

653
00:40:53,220 --> 00:40:56,220
um one thing you can see here is

654
00:40:56,220 --> 00:41:01,619
on icons so what is that what is the
first thing that people

655
00:41:01,619 --> 00:41:05,670
do when they see when these you know
privacy notices are

656
00:41:05,670 --> 00:41:10,750
Euler's well would be quickly search for
the OK button or I agree button

657
00:41:10,750 --> 00:41:14,430
because you just wanna give it a thing
right so

658
00:41:14,430 --> 00:41:19,060
while they're doing that and maybe in
this case they see some pictures

659
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:22,609
they'd prolly are going to read anything
but if they see some pictures then

660
00:41:22,609 --> 00:41:26,359
police pictorially you can so to see

661
00:41:26,359 --> 00:41:30,720
on some indication of what the f is
doing

662
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:34,200
so this is sorta one thought here to you
sort of pictures are some

663
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:40,020
other ways to get user understanding

664
00:41:40,020 --> 00:41:44,150
another another point um that I should
mention is that

665
00:41:44,150 --> 00:41:47,170
at the Bonham with that a

666
00:41:47,170 --> 00:41:50,640
dialogue there's a there's a little
unchecked box

667
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:55,060
for on giving the after a mission to
share your data

668
00:41:55,060 --> 00:41:58,250
so it's unchecked right and that's
important

669
00:41:58,250 --> 00:42:02,069
there's a principal and privacy by
design call her

670
00:42:02,069 --> 00:42:06,349
primis private by default if the user
doesn't do anything

671
00:42:06,349 --> 00:42:09,550
very he should maintain his privacy

672
00:42:09,550 --> 00:42:13,349
and that's and that's important right
because a most the time is not gonna do

673
00:42:13,349 --> 00:42:14,880
anything

674
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:19,650
right so it's similar to fail safe and
security right

675
00:42:19,650 --> 00:42:23,369
if something fails on security are some
the users not paying attention you want

676
00:42:23,369 --> 00:42:24,770
things to still be safe

677
00:42:24,770 --> 00:42:31,310
right so you still want things to be
private if these are not doing anything

678
00:42:31,310 --> 00:42:34,869
this is interesting what this means in
the in that case at something like

679
00:42:34,869 --> 00:42:36,369
Facebook

680
00:42:36,369 --> 00:42:41,810
I where prompted you can't you can't
have absolute privacy 24

681
00:42:41,810 --> 00:42:44,990
because you were not communicating with
any your friends or anything and

682
00:42:44,990 --> 00:42:49,990
users would not her necessarily no to go
in and change your settings

683
00:42:49,990 --> 00:42:53,339
so they can't exactly adopt this I'm but

684
00:42:53,339 --> 00:42:57,940
the ideas this is what you should strive
for

685
00:42:57,940 --> 00:43:01,359
um

686
00:43:01,359 --> 00:43:05,650
another and you might notice the
similarity

687
00:43:05,650 --> 00:43:10,400
I love you know this Sat Nav you know

688
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:14,480
sensor data and what you're doing with
that to enjoy commissions

689
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:17,730
so when you install an Android app trade
you get this

690
00:43:17,730 --> 00:43:21,240
so a long list of commissions

691
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:25,020
it's sorta like a privacy notices and
Euler's

692
00:43:25,020 --> 00:43:28,480
most users don't pay any attention to it
right you just scroll down as fast as

693
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:29,119
you can and

694
00:43:29,119 --> 00:43:33,599
and just click that thing because used

695
00:43:33,599 --> 00:43:37,510
adhered these this thing is getting in
the way if you installing the app

696
00:43:37,510 --> 00:43:41,540
great United you not him users are not
here to like I try to analyze their

697
00:43:41,540 --> 00:43:42,109
their

698
00:43:42,109 --> 00:43:46,030
the the privacy ramifications of this
app they just wanna start the app and do

699
00:43:46,030 --> 00:43:49,609
what

700
00:43:49,609 --> 00:43:53,369
right so given that

701
00:43:53,369 --> 00:43:56,800
home when you do

702
00:43:56,800 --> 00:44:00,069
well there aren't there are some
approaches people are looking at so for

703
00:44:00,069 --> 00:44:00,980
instance

704
00:44:00,980 --> 00:44:04,130
some contextual approaches so instead I
love

705
00:44:04,130 --> 00:44:07,520
you know in the very beginning when you
install the app in the user's

706
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:10,569
very unlikely to be paying attention at
that time right

707
00:44:10,569 --> 00:44:16,030
you he sorta asked for permission only
at the time you need

708
00:44:16,030 --> 00:44:19,880
so if you are getting location data for
instance

709
00:44:19,880 --> 00:44:23,369
then maybe only asked just just at that
time

710
00:44:23,369 --> 00:44:26,369
and there's there have been some studies
would say that my

711
00:44:26,369 --> 00:44:29,819
work a little bit better but obviously
this is a really

712
00:44:29,819 --> 00:44:33,880
you know young field and I just want to
convey that

713
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:37,150
right now things are and probably a
sorry state right

714
00:44:37,150 --> 00:44:41,880
sad to say and but there's a lotta you
know work people are trying to do to try

715
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:43,240
to make it better

716
00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:47,690
but how much they can make matters
unclear

717
00:44:47,690 --> 00:44:50,690
um so justice just the sum up

718
00:44:50,690 --> 00:44:53,950
prayer we've we look at a couple

719
00:44:53,950 --> 00:44:58,740
aspects to privacy by design it's now
the to the de facto standard for privacy

720
00:44:58,740 --> 00:44:59,900
engineering

721
00:44:59,900 --> 00:45:04,490
on most amid you know because we're
security people as soda

722
00:45:04,490 --> 00:45:07,720
very comfortable but there are some
aspects that are a little

723
00:45:07,720 --> 00:45:10,819
home maybe less comfortable

724
00:45:10,819 --> 00:45:15,030
um the two aspects are may be less
comfortable or data minimisation

725
00:45:15,030 --> 00:45:18,079
for data minimisation I'm

726
00:45:18,079 --> 00:45:22,619
emphasizes machine learning and this is
gonna get more and more important right

727
00:45:22,619 --> 00:45:26,819
has her big data and

728
00:45:26,819 --> 00:45:30,700
as the size of a sickly big data grows
in more and more data is gonna be

729
00:45:30,700 --> 00:45:32,160
collected about you

730
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:36,800
alright so this is more important
another aspect of this is a.m.

731
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:41,109
use our understanding user understanding
it emphasizes the human-computer

732
00:45:41,109 --> 00:45:42,609
interface

733
00:45:42,609 --> 00:45:45,810
and this is gonna get harder to

734
00:45:45,810 --> 00:45:50,540
right so we're moving into a world I
love mobile and Internet of Things

735
00:45:50,540 --> 00:45:54,680
in this new world helped you get
noticing consent

736
00:45:54,680 --> 00:45:57,770
right from a sensor a street camera I
mean

737
00:45:57,770 --> 00:46:00,910
the did the models are unclear

738
00:46:00,910 --> 00:46:04,950
right so this is another

739
00:46:04,950 --> 00:46:10,900
a area I think that will deserve a lot
of attention in the future

740
00:46:10,900 --> 00:46:13,950
um finally

741
00:46:13,950 --> 00:46:17,869
I want to say that you know I didn't
cover a lot

742
00:46:17,869 --> 00:46:21,170
okay so there's not a privacy topics
that

743
00:46:21,170 --> 00:46:25,140
are kinda a on the side like children's
privacy

744
00:46:25,140 --> 00:46:29,579
alright thanks in and the fact that you
know different regions of the world have

745
00:46:29,579 --> 00:46:33,470
kinda different privacy laws and

746
00:46:33,470 --> 00:46:38,250
how that all plays together so when you
do these names especially

747
00:46:38,250 --> 00:46:41,339
for user understand you probably want to
consult

748
00:46:41,339 --> 00:46:44,760
your privacy lawyer in your company

749
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:48,450
okay so they will be able to give you
guidance on

750
00:46:48,450 --> 00:46:51,910
whether what your design whether
actually is OK

751
00:46:51,910 --> 00:46:55,589
from the legal point of view okay so

752
00:46:55,589 --> 00:47:00,400
sister souljah many disclaimer there com

753
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:05,010
Adam at thanks and if you have any
questions i'm happy to

754
00:47:05,010 --> 00:47:12,010
track yeah

755
00:47:18,540 --> 00:47:19,320
right so

756
00:47:19,320 --> 00:47:23,570
on so there are legal

757
00:47:23,570 --> 00:47:27,980
them so there are potential there are
legal so whatever

758
00:47:27,980 --> 00:47:33,370
a policy home accepted depend on the
regional welcome to the world year

759
00:47:33,370 --> 00:47:36,950
rain so um that depending on

760
00:47:36,950 --> 00:47:40,840
the regional world they might define and
this is

761
00:47:40,840 --> 00:47:44,720
again this is not technical missus more
policy law

762
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:48,330
about what constitutes personal data RPI

763
00:47:48,330 --> 00:47:52,210
right so in the US nom it's a little
more

764
00:47:52,210 --> 00:47:55,520
loose in Europe its good

765
00:47:55,520 --> 00:47:58,830
more things would be considered personal
data but

766
00:47:58,830 --> 00:48:02,090
assist a general statement but again

767
00:48:02,090 --> 00:48:05,220
I think I think I want to recommend from
our point of view

768
00:48:05,220 --> 00:48:11,380
here at least for on the technical side
it's a bit hard to get involved in that

769
00:48:11,380 --> 00:48:14,620
kind of thing good I i prefer to let the
lawyers

770
00:48:14,620 --> 00:48:18,950
handle it and say well this is this is
the approach is acceptable

771
00:48:18,950 --> 00:48:22,000
and the NSA they should sign off on it

772
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:29,000
her

773
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:36,280
go ahead

774
00:48:58,990 --> 00:49:00,650
here it depends

775
00:49:00,650 --> 00:49:05,240
depend in that example who was the head
the depended on the technical need

776
00:49:05,240 --> 00:49:08,870
so for that project the kind of data
that we collected

777
00:49:08,870 --> 00:49:12,430
it was it was sort of acceptable to

778
00:49:12,430 --> 00:49:18,710
to change it every few days home sold
for other kinds of data in will be

779
00:49:18,710 --> 00:49:19,280
different

780
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:23,650
way so it would be trippin probably by
the user up the data

781
00:49:23,650 --> 00:49:27,560
some so at the privacy

782
00:49:27,560 --> 00:49:30,880
person you know obviously would be
pushing for

783
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:34,590
a smaller interval but they you know

784
00:49:34,590 --> 00:49:40,000
might need a longer interval yeah

785
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:44,030
yeah other

786
00:49:44,030 --> 00:49:51,030
more more questions then I guess

787
00:49:52,130 --> 00:49:56,420
I guess we can break for lunch thanks

788
00:49:56,420 --> 00:50:00,540
way
