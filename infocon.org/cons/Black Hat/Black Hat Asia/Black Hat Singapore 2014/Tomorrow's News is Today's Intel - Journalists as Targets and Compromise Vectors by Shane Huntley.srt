1
00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:03,840
I'll lunch and Hanley and I write this
presentation

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:09,200
with a colleague of mine Morgan marquee
blog and we're talking today about us

3
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:13,120
journalists as targets specifically john
also targets

4
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:16,209
all of state-sponsored and government
hacking

5
00:00:16,209 --> 00:00:21,609
um for smaller unable to make it here
today but I'll do my best to

6
00:00:21,609 --> 00:00:25,570
keep you entertained and won't see where
it goes from there

7
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:30,099
um get her out why we talking to
journalists

8
00:00:30,099 --> 00:00:33,750
arm and I really wanna talk about the
actual threats we see

9
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:37,649
i think is a live kinda theoretical
threats as also love hyped

10
00:00:37,649 --> 00:00:41,780
threats out there and a lot of people
who are kind of selling she is suing

11
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:43,140
advanced persistent threat

12
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:46,420
and always other sort of Conniff
buzzwords but

13
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:49,410
we're gonna be in a good position that
we actually have seen a lot of these

14
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:50,030
attacks

15
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:53,820
for real only one penny pitchers like
what's going on the ground as far as we

16
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:54,280
see it

17
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:58,199
on ans I wanna talk about it regional
variation as well

18
00:00:58,199 --> 00:01:03,090
I'm I don't wanna just talk about NSA
like missus note I don't wanna just talk

19
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:04,670
about china on a kind of

20
00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:08,570
in a bit in the variety it had general
seating time in different ways depending

21
00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:10,330
on witnesses and journalists or

22
00:01:10,330 --> 00:01:13,310
when it comes to the Middle East all
other parts of the world and there are

23
00:01:13,310 --> 00:01:14,960
some key differences which I think

24
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:19,600
is interesting to look at um

25
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:22,799
answer then maybe told me that what I
can do so

26
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:26,439
arm one thing we do

27
00:01:26,439 --> 00:01:30,759
for well as my job in Google and and
Woodside not everything I'm talking

28
00:01:30,759 --> 00:01:32,009
about here is Google work in

29
00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:35,799
my opinions on line of my employers but
one thing that Google does

30
00:01:35,799 --> 00:01:39,939
is we actually identify a user's that

31
00:01:39,939 --> 00:01:43,259
other targets of state-sponsored attacks
and

32
00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:46,869
as too much anyone that we believe is
being directly targeted by

33
00:01:46,869 --> 00:01:50,890
fishing now or something that we can
actually talk by to a group or a

34
00:01:50,890 --> 00:01:51,860
campaign

35
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:55,930
which we we don't commit suicide a crime
we don't think this is for profit

36
00:01:55,930 --> 00:01:59,590
we r pretty sure that we believe that
this is actually

37
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:03,689
into being done directly by government
or bike on it government-supported

38
00:02:03,689 --> 00:02:06,939
actors and we do this periodically

39
00:02:06,939 --> 00:02:10,379
primarily as a mechanism to give these
uses this information

40
00:02:10,379 --> 00:02:14,410
and as tens of thousands of the sky and
every couple of months

41
00:02:14,410 --> 00:02:18,800
and we just want a whole not a bunch of
these uses last week

42
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:23,290
almost 50,000 in fact and as we've done
this at the time

43
00:02:23,290 --> 00:02:27,360
more than I really noticed that certain
groups of people a massively

44
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:30,280
over-represented in the people they
constantly telling the baton to

45
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,500
state-sponsored attacks

46
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:35,680
and one group that's mean
disproportionately targeted as

47
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:36,840
journalists of

48
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:39,970
all stripes and for all around the world
but

49
00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:43,629
and it being attacked from everywhere in
the world as well so

50
00:02:43,629 --> 00:02:46,950
everyone in the world is attacking
journalists everywhere in the world

51
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:50,030
in different state sponsored mechanisms
ans

52
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:53,769
because in that we decided to like which
line drawn overall picture about what

53
00:02:53,769 --> 00:02:55,500
what that means for journalism today

54
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:59,060
misconduct the was the calm motivation
behind the store

55
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:02,599
arm very very kind of

56
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:06,700
I don't really don't teach in american
history lesson because

57
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:11,019
in the lead in America on Australian I
still find americans little bit weird

58
00:03:11,019 --> 00:03:15,040
but it Americans do have this whole
first amendment things such as like

59
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,180
freedom in the press

60
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:20,489
and it's really important and freedom
expression is massively important to the

61
00:03:20,489 --> 00:03:22,230
US is massively important to

62
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:27,090
you do land it also import around the
world but you know this is like the 18th

63
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:27,870
century

64
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:31,599
group ans

65
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:34,950
you know he met him in the number one
was like 23

66
00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:38,970
was like in the 20th century they sold
it it was that important that time

67
00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:44,049
on and you know in more modern times
this like the Universal Declaration of

68
00:03:44,049 --> 00:03:45,049
Human Rights

69
00:03:45,049 --> 00:03:48,260
is that you know if we do makes pressure
and the free into

70
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:52,459
apartheid Easter media is considered
like central do but civil society

71
00:03:52,459 --> 00:03:57,150
ants why is this my best examples
watergate

72
00:03:57,150 --> 00:04:01,239
and which willie with that I'm a talk to
journalists and

73
00:04:01,239 --> 00:04:05,290
and read a lot about journalism a really
see the roles in journalism is

74
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:08,860
holding the powerful to account I'm has
been described in the British system is

75
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:10,420
before first night as in

76
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:14,489
10 the he pops up like society in cana
governments have

77
00:04:14,489 --> 00:04:18,540
this is the kind of checks and balances
in the system and even in the US

78
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:22,470
might mediating into my hey Dave
investigative journalism actually took

79
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:23,330
down a president

80
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:27,280
so here I think government's interested
in people that are capable of taking

81
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,250
down in Thai government's then

82
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:33,720
what are they interested in ans another
interesting thing which I think lies in

83
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:38,080
modern times is his ideas actually the
confidentiality that journalists

84
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:41,090
need to have is key to how to do the job

85
00:04:41,090 --> 00:04:44,790
like nobody's going to be a confidential
informant

86
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:49,070
all very few people %ah requires much
more brave to be confidential informant

87
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:53,350
if you don't think a journalist can keep
a secret and the Watergate source

88
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:57,500
was actually secret for thirty years and
the government really didn't go off for

89
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:00,940
getting pollution can actually force him
to reveal even though in the US

90
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:04,050
there is no actual decided
constitutional protection on the value

91
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:05,389
of sources but

92
00:05:05,389 --> 00:05:09,500
sources are and true danger and really
are a key part of society and you

93
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:12,820
really see what is actually happening to
summit the leaders but if you believe

94
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:13,850
what they're doing it

95
00:05:13,850 --> 00:05:18,380
it really upping their lives on the line
so it really is serious consequences

96
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:19,650
leaking so

97
00:05:19,650 --> 00:05:23,410
this is part of it but so that's the
whole why john also important but

98
00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:27,210
its deal thing is like spine I'm not
trying to go

99
00:05:27,210 --> 00:05:31,940
a moral position on spine but is
describes the second oldest profession

100
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:36,169
um ans just so long as there is like
governments

101
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:39,199
so long as our people people died 21
information

102
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:42,970
and journalists had great contact
networks

103
00:05:42,970 --> 00:05:46,370
and traditionally all especially more
recent times

104
00:05:46,370 --> 00:05:49,740
that don't necessarily have the greatest
operational security

105
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:53,979
so this kind of makes them the perfect
hot

106
00:05:53,979 --> 00:05:58,509
because everything we see it out kinda
tired and hacking as opposed to the

107
00:05:58,509 --> 00:06:00,009
recreational hacking

108
00:06:00,009 --> 00:06:03,680
all the kinda money hacking the Wii see
the biggest

109
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:06,720
characteristic a state-sponsored hacking
is

110
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:10,449
they go where the intelligences and they
go with intelligence which is a value to

111
00:06:10,449 --> 00:06:11,600
their

112
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:15,780
governments and has different places has
held held in other governments

113
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:20,100
it held into a protest group buttoned
and more often than not

114
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:23,370
journalists on this bright white
actually know people on both sides and

115
00:06:23,370 --> 00:06:26,009
actually had the sources they had these
contacts

116
00:06:26,009 --> 00:06:30,069
and therefore they make direct on its
like national security reasons or state

117
00:06:30,069 --> 00:06:31,509
security reasons

118
00:06:31,509 --> 00:06:34,800
and it goes away back to in terms of
like even the US

119
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:38,470
as freedom of press had when back in a
lot of time all

120
00:06:38,470 --> 00:06:41,690
one of the previous time since I was
heading this candles just to show how

121
00:06:41,690 --> 00:06:43,539
history repeats itself

122
00:06:43,539 --> 00:06:47,880
that declassified documents show that
like an essay with spinal New York Times

123
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:49,690
misconduct led to

124
00:06:49,690 --> 00:06:52,889
the church comedian want the previous
order

125
00:06:52,889 --> 00:06:58,590
we worked in the SHR up and so that is
project minaret with a kind declared

126
00:06:58,590 --> 00:07:01,039
people so the state security risks and
they were

127
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:05,020
Connor spine the communications back in
a Capri digital age

128
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:08,819
a listing in the phone calls so and

129
00:07:08,819 --> 00:07:12,130
thats con this has been going on a long
time but

130
00:07:12,130 --> 00:07:17,169
I think things are different now like
journalism is rapidly changing

131
00:07:17,169 --> 00:07:21,169
Tom its but becoming a lot better but
also in some ways

132
00:07:21,169 --> 00:07:26,729
a little bit worse that is actually a
huge competition from the newspaper is

133
00:07:26,729 --> 00:07:30,780
any compete with arm you know citizen
journalism and the complete with

134
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:31,530
bloggers

135
00:07:31,530 --> 00:07:35,500
having to that had the classified ads
stick on a plan to lend money more than

136
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:37,160
compete with Google ads or

137
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:41,130
always on the mechanism so in many ways
they have more tools at their disposal

138
00:07:41,130 --> 00:07:43,069
than ever before

139
00:07:43,069 --> 00:07:46,660
except there's not nearly as common as
much money so it's not really as much

140
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:48,860
the budget investigative journalism so

141
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:52,150
the heavy lifting is being really picked
up by

142
00:07:52,150 --> 00:07:56,150
you know it the kind of people doing the
leaking people on the ground citizen

143
00:07:56,150 --> 00:07:57,220
journalism

144
00:07:57,220 --> 00:08:00,639
and missed seeing you know people have
any cans are planning to use you

145
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:04,780
as opposed to having to have that kind
of in vietnam you have the

146
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:08,530
kinda on silent porno with his conduct
actual

147
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:12,220
cameras and inform back and actually
being played a news organization

148
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:16,310
now you actually have the guy his pot
and see an oppositional DG process

149
00:08:16,310 --> 00:08:17,650
movement on the ground so

150
00:08:17,650 --> 00:08:22,500
is one what journalism is these days
isn't water than ever

151
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:25,879
um and will send the agent leaks as well
love

152
00:08:25,879 --> 00:08:30,199
you know easy for information to be
given to journalists as well

153
00:08:30,199 --> 00:08:33,560
on miss a pitch on my colleagues in the
office

154
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:36,990
on we don't always dress like this but
just on special occasions

155
00:08:36,990 --> 00:08:40,050
um I'll go through some specific

156
00:08:40,050 --> 00:08:43,640
threats and attacks the states that
we've actually same

157
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:47,440
on I may be a little bit by about some
other things that I had commissioned to

158
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:52,290
out retarded or out every tackle I want
to be 100 essential but

159
00:08:52,290 --> 00:08:56,420
I think I can give you apps really good
luv you

160
00:08:56,420 --> 00:09:00,490
love the real things that happened in
the last couple of years

161
00:09:00,490 --> 00:09:05,100
arm so

162
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:08,380
let's stop back it kinda fairly famous
incident

163
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:13,500
9 as a war are all the China instead
with Google

164
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:17,110
arm so as probably anybody who works in
computer security

165
00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:20,519
knows that late

166
00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:24,230
2009 Google actually detected a

167
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:28,089
intrusion on the network and it was

168
00:09:28,089 --> 00:09:31,820
be identified it had originated in China
and

169
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:35,350
I think these days would say that you
know you look has some

170
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:38,459
able what level state-sponsored attack
to it

171
00:09:38,459 --> 00:09:41,660
and directly pre watershed moment one
because

172
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:44,269
people actually took a stand against
china about this on a lot of different

173
00:09:44,269 --> 00:09:45,110
issues

174
00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:49,920
but also is probably one of the beach
for this condo

175
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:53,420
victims a ball with activity actually
going public but

176
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:57,350
but wasn't really picked up is that and
the time do with bryan said

177
00:09:57,350 --> 00:10:02,200
they were hacked I was in there the time
but work on it not many people like

178
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:06,070
picked up at the time will remember that
at the time they said they had clearly

179
00:10:06,070 --> 00:10:07,220
identified it

180
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:10,779
over twenty other organizations were
hatched and

181
00:10:10,779 --> 00:10:14,079
they came from a wide-ranging business
is this was just one attack coming from

182
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:14,709
China

183
00:10:14,709 --> 00:10:17,980
they were able to definitively say date

184
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:21,480
had owns twenty other organizations and
in that list again

185
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:25,170
was media and its

186
00:10:25,170 --> 00:10:28,320
I didn't as we going on is obviously

187
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,579
made a lot more interest in has been
huge amounts if

188
00:10:31,579 --> 00:10:34,649
kinda tracking all and understanding

189
00:10:34,649 --> 00:10:40,450
all Conniff Chinese I P T is the time
and it's been a busy one has been

190
00:10:40,450 --> 00:10:44,829
night dragon there's been so many groups
I'm anything's gonna put out there noun

191
00:10:44,829 --> 00:10:48,930
I think this massively great a
comprehensive pitcher about Chinese

192
00:10:48,930 --> 00:10:50,829
hacking in the modern world

193
00:10:50,829 --> 00:10:54,160
amongst hacking for many other nations
but

194
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:58,810
again and again both from this group
another group when we examine a group

195
00:10:58,810 --> 00:11:02,040
one of the things we do an outcall
financial workers who work at

196
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:05,649
who they targeting ans make a list K

197
00:11:05,649 --> 00:11:09,230
he's got it I think I've whale industry
in the media these targets

198
00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:13,190
these ones that are getting you know
economics in the media and

199
00:11:13,190 --> 00:11:16,740
again and again we've had this list will
be targeting couple different things

200
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:21,390
but I think one of the most common if
not the most common targets and

201
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:25,180
all groups in every aspect is the media
that they going

202
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:28,769
will target the actual specific thing
wrapped up possible also tied to the

203
00:11:28,769 --> 00:11:29,250
journal's

204
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:32,870
both beso journalist always seen as part
of this campaign

205
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:36,750
and some ways I think the the the week a
part of it because

206
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:40,930
one journalists on secure security
people and has been his Porsche post

207
00:11:40,930 --> 00:11:42,029
Aurora that the

208
00:11:42,029 --> 00:11:45,360
the companies are actually getting
better the company's really believing in

209
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,250
the threat

210
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:49,170
is always products out there people
understanding and people saying

211
00:11:49,170 --> 00:11:52,329
upgrading tell people sending the people
to conferences like black cat

212
00:11:52,329 --> 00:11:55,450
miss starting to understand the threat
but these kinda on the ground

213
00:11:55,450 --> 00:11:55,920
journalists

214
00:11:55,920 --> 00:12:00,060
activists a probably lag behind a little
bit

215
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:03,120
so another specific much more recent one

216
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:07,200
icon Manny in exact organizations a
major

217
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:11,990
media organization and has just a modern
variant of it that

218
00:12:11,990 --> 00:12:15,450
sending out now where pretending to be
like in other offices is an

219
00:12:15,450 --> 00:12:18,779
international organization pertaining to
be the Beijing office

220
00:12:18,779 --> 00:12:22,760
and listening at these documents with
the exploits

221
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:26,709
and this is where the actual
organizational security files down that

222
00:12:26,709 --> 00:12:29,910
you will open by at least employees ans

223
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:33,990
Inc on the follow-up discussions was
like all we had only security products

224
00:12:33,990 --> 00:12:34,779
installed

225
00:12:34,779 --> 00:12:39,160
ants biz wasn't particularly advanced
malware wasn't even

226
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:42,410
it was an exploit but it was an exploit
the been patched like

227
00:12:42,410 --> 00:12:45,649
at least 12 months ago but this feeling
that

228
00:12:45,649 --> 00:12:49,680
you know I had by born any Barisan gonna
love and all in black had not bought

229
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:51,519
like at least half the products

230
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:55,829
and its you know it didn't any bar
satisfy my mail gateway said it was fine

231
00:12:55,829 --> 00:12:57,070
but

232
00:12:57,070 --> 00:13:00,250
in reality that's not enough when he's a
targeted attack because these apps

233
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:01,839
specifically pertaining to be

234
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:06,050
their office they only sent it to a
small number people they tweeted so

235
00:13:06,050 --> 00:13:09,920
it didn't end up with anything on bars
total so they a test against the AB

236
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:14,300
scan as well and I sent it out and
they're able to compromise that people

237
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:17,529
and and this is the thing we see
literally

238
00:13:17,529 --> 00:13:21,410
every day in some aspects we see this
studies going on the Internet

239
00:13:21,410 --> 00:13:25,930
it's not super sophisticated this is the
chinese mechanism generally is you see

240
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:30,209
the you see the zip files the PDF's the
RTS

241
00:13:30,209 --> 00:13:33,940
and its sheer volumes from all different
groups whatever the area is

242
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:37,930
and I think the success rates low
detection rate is really high

243
00:13:37,930 --> 00:13:41,399
but just sheer volume it works

244
00:13:41,399 --> 00:13:45,660
arm so this is thus

245
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:49,800
a different story entirely different
envelope is that this is actually

246
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:54,079
I'll government in the middle eastern
area

247
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:58,290
and this is actually where you know
national newspaper is actually being

248
00:13:58,290 --> 00:13:59,380
targeted

249
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:02,810
directly by their own government
something which

250
00:14:02,810 --> 00:14:07,740
we r min hope we don't have to deal with
as much around here

251
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:11,100
but or in the Western world but
definitely

252
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:14,690
prevalent Middle East ans in this case

253
00:14:14,690 --> 00:14:18,019
there was Polak to compromise people
pulled in

254
00:14:18,019 --> 00:14:21,959
doing the forensics and when it went
down to it identified that yes the

255
00:14:21,959 --> 00:14:23,550
malware installed

256
00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:26,829
and would look good when

257
00:14:26,829 --> 00:14:30,839
way and other portable the malware was
it was actually

258
00:14:30,839 --> 00:14:34,449
is to open Fisher I don't have anyone
people heard in Fisher

259
00:14:34,449 --> 00:14:39,490
on but think this is a great tool
valproate platform it's a

260
00:14:39,490 --> 00:14:44,089
content has back doors with modules for
it has been great capabilities

261
00:14:44,089 --> 00:14:47,940
arm but it's a commercial tool arm
supposedly

262
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:51,139
one that only sell soul to not friendly
governments and I

263
00:14:51,139 --> 00:14:53,920
definitely wouldn't call with particular
Middle East in government a friendly

264
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:54,889
government

265
00:14:54,889 --> 00:14:58,769
but this is a company that's based in
the you can Germany

266
00:14:58,769 --> 00:15:02,480
arm and they sell these tools

267
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:06,360
on and the stalled hanging up on me your
organization's

268
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:09,910
of people and example of climate

269
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:13,959
China this definitely is for sale
directly to conduct these

270
00:15:13,959 --> 00:15:17,829
repressive time governments is this is
actually a document that was seized when

271
00:15:17,829 --> 00:15:18,269
the

272
00:15:18,269 --> 00:15:21,610
the bar crimp fell ans is actually

273
00:15:21,610 --> 00:15:25,269
been pulled from like day consequent the
secret police headquarters

274
00:15:25,269 --> 00:15:28,399
and it's a Conniff purchase order to

275
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:32,329
by looking fish a software analyst sold
a lot 297

276
00:15:32,329 --> 00:15:36,290
thousand euros or something which I'd
kind described like that sounds like a

277
00:15:36,290 --> 00:15:37,320
lot the software that

278
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:40,589
and reality is kinda be tight a pocket
change it's the sort of

279
00:15:40,589 --> 00:15:43,600
you know what they spend on gold caps
and work and

280
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:47,860
to the bathroom magnet third bathroom
and sits down from that you can buy

281
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:49,440
really up on a whole

282
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:53,480
hacking capability which allows you to
conduct really get into your

283
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:57,139
condo what if you want including a
domestic newspaper that might

284
00:15:57,139 --> 00:16:00,579
had some issue and make something say
bad things about you corruption or

285
00:16:00,579 --> 00:16:02,240
something like that

286
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:07,120
ans move install a research with his
citizen lab work and actually looking at

287
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:11,139
with in Fisher said is our located
around the world and

288
00:16:11,139 --> 00:16:14,519
a found that there is quite a
considerable number

289
00:16:14,519 --> 00:16:17,930
these is a very popular products they
really do provide great service and fun

290
00:16:17,930 --> 00:16:18,769
great training

291
00:16:18,769 --> 00:16:22,820
ongoing support and you you're like a a
police force R Us

292
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:26,560
security service you can you know wanna
check em out

293
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:30,360
seem to know so what apparently only
defend the government's

294
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:34,550
what they say arm so

295
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:37,680
as but citizen journalists

296
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:40,720
I'll

297
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:44,029
something citizen journalists was
actually Conniff

298
00:16:44,029 --> 00:16:47,170
with the future this is because

299
00:16:47,170 --> 00:16:50,310
just look at the reporting missing from
around the world arm

300
00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:54,389
if you wanna know what's going on in the
Syrian Civil War

301
00:16:54,389 --> 00:16:56,980
arm there's some good reporting coming
after the traditional news organizations

302
00:16:56,980 --> 00:16:58,699
for the people look

303
00:16:58,699 --> 00:17:03,509
I really capturing the the real images
on the ground

304
00:17:03,509 --> 00:17:07,410
what what's going on when there's a gas
attack or what's actually happening

305
00:17:07,410 --> 00:17:10,539
Conniff in these places where the
fighting is actually going on

306
00:17:10,539 --> 00:17:14,400
huge amounts and this is actually coming
from a citizen media

307
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:18,780
and its this organization applied for
nasa horribly

308
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:22,079
is mom fucking each dot com

309
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:25,370
and its this was the citizen media
project

310
00:17:25,370 --> 00:17:28,569
ants it grew out of the Arab Spring

311
00:17:28,569 --> 00:17:32,070
I'll early 2011 and

312
00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:35,270
its quite critical all Morocco

313
00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:38,610
and its daily draconian government

314
00:17:38,610 --> 00:17:41,960
IOM and its

315
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:45,299
early last year won awards for Google
for its

316
00:17:45,299 --> 00:17:49,740
Google for its voices to defend and
promote freedom of speech

317
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:54,610
and right across the internet so once
bright awarding for this page

318
00:17:54,610 --> 00:17:57,870
ans so eleven days later however

319
00:17:57,870 --> 00:18:01,100
they receive an e-mail and the same
hours no

320
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:05,880
not there to congratulate them on their
ward

321
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:10,580
a so on my notes but don't speak French

322
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:14,270
on so and this example judgment

323
00:18:14,270 --> 00:18:18,280
really good targeting that your eBay
knows potholed

324
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:22,000
denunciation on and was and this

325
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,080
be attempt to be a denunciation as
saying as a link to what looks like a

326
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:27,240
Word document

327
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:31,679
it's saying that the scandal and as has
has a single line a French they're

328
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:32,410
saying

329
00:18:32,410 --> 00:18:37,010
which translate something is please do
not mention my name so it simply as a

330
00:18:37,010 --> 00:18:40,500
kinda confidential source he is a
scandal

331
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:43,630
his what's going on so this is a

332
00:18:43,630 --> 00:18:48,360
it's a great bait because let's face it
journalists have to

333
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:51,570
open things from sources so

334
00:18:51,570 --> 00:18:55,090
the try to open the file ans

335
00:18:55,090 --> 00:18:59,770
when they open it again do some poor
security at how we build things

336
00:18:59,770 --> 00:19:03,039
actually ends up being a job that
actually has malware

337
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:06,270
and you actually turns out to be

338
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:13,270
another commercial hacking tool

339
00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:19,350
um and the same hacking tool with down's
in

340
00:19:19,350 --> 00:19:22,620
but targeting I

341
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:25,690
bite what looks like the ethiopians so

342
00:19:25,690 --> 00:19:28,700
his organization called he sat

343
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:32,320
which is a a media organization

344
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:36,480
formed an Ethiopian actually based in
the US and

345
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:41,340
late last year me saying this attack is
again this is content

346
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:46,570
I its a que se you may be like blocking
these low-level things but these things

347
00:19:46,570 --> 00:19:48,470
the things that are actually working at
the moment

348
00:19:48,470 --> 00:19:52,720
the actually a couple hours they made
three separate aims to target these

349
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,010
employees as he sat

350
00:19:54,010 --> 00:19:57,920
with sophisticated computer spyware ans

351
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:04,920
the first attempt can anyone see what's
wrong with this picture hopefully yes

352
00:20:05,110 --> 00:20:08,950
so its is on the in the people spotted
this right like this is the example of

353
00:20:08,950 --> 00:20:09,480
like

354
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:13,050
how the government supplying Adam I'm at
the low end they're actually like

355
00:20:13,050 --> 00:20:17,530
you note the Rafale hasn't XE you know
please accept this article

356
00:20:17,530 --> 00:20:21,100
didn't work and we look to what was arm

357
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:24,350
more than discovered that it was the on

358
00:20:24,350 --> 00:20:27,410
the a tool called

359
00:20:27,410 --> 00:20:31,850
a tool by hacking team and hacking team

360
00:20:31,850 --> 00:20:35,660
Italian based company which also sell
it's about time this is from one in

361
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:36,160
there

362
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:39,390
great a kind of sales pitches about

363
00:20:39,390 --> 00:20:43,090
its cool of CSI slashing invisible to
the target

364
00:20:43,090 --> 00:20:47,070
if you're interested boys relationships
title occasion when browsing

365
00:20:47,070 --> 00:20:50,230
always things the carp only compromise

366
00:20:50,230 --> 00:20:54,410
that if you just from these things and
it was really worried about

367
00:20:54,410 --> 00:20:57,560
always looking tradition and other
assorted aspects but if you can just

368
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:59,420
trick you use and installing this

369
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:04,420
it's all going over and again more with
Matt actually what witnesses around the

370
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:05,130
world

371
00:21:05,130 --> 00:21:08,470
if you look at it it's not exactly the
map of you know the

372
00:21:08,470 --> 00:21:12,280
Cardiff this is a map and the greatest
freedom expression leading countries in

373
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:12,880
the world

374
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:16,140
arm ans

375
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:20,630
so going back to like most doctor worked
in on the action

376
00:21:20,630 --> 00:21:24,640
rosso these guys are actually like
talking to Mike you know this should

377
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:27,220
actually be an XE you try to send me a
dog and

378
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:30,450
you know they you quickly come back and
saying all

379
00:21:30,450 --> 00:21:34,300
sorry his adult miss and I quickly send
a dog

380
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:37,920
and its the doc has the same now wearing
it

381
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:42,690
and its the Fed so this is the
depressing thing missus

382
00:21:42,690 --> 00:21:46,760
what's happening in this is what's
working so I got the doc ans

383
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:49,970
you know RTS arm

384
00:21:49,970 --> 00:21:54,130
so let you know artifice rich text
format

385
00:21:54,130 --> 00:21:57,960
so it's kind of my kid it's meant to be

386
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:02,190
like ASCII text inventive mock up allows
you to kind of

387
00:22:02,190 --> 00:22:06,520
you make things a little bit more kinda
express Word docs

388
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:10,360
sort of but in a format that meant to be
cross-platform as kinda like a legacy

389
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:11,760
format is used in outlaw

390
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:14,930
its abuses compatibility liau it's an
open format

391
00:22:14,930 --> 00:22:18,990
but on the last couple pieces had a
one-on-one abilities

392
00:22:18,990 --> 00:22:22,430
and due to the fact that people had
parted office

393
00:22:22,430 --> 00:22:25,570
and people have old versions of Office
is become

394
00:22:25,570 --> 00:22:30,180
the workhorse exploits all the both the
government people

395
00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:34,360
and increasing was on the prime people
like it used to be PDF Venetian Jacob

396
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:37,660
EDS but these days rich text format

397
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:40,680
is totally taking over so this is an
exploit

398
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:43,980
arm you know back are referred to as
quad

399
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:47,330
13 in the office because 2010 exploit

400
00:22:47,330 --> 00:22:50,850
but we see this again everyday targeting
users

401
00:22:50,850 --> 00:22:53,910
and the reason is that such a beautiful
exploit it's just a straight Stack

402
00:22:53,910 --> 00:22:54,560
Overflow

403
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:57,730
it's like so to exploit that I was
watching as Selina

404
00:22:57,730 --> 00:23:01,020
much younger younger hack attack in

405
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:06,480
you know 2009 back in like 20 2009 I
dislike straight Stack Overflow

406
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:11,230
Tom you specify the fragments c5 then
you specify return address just the

407
00:23:11,230 --> 00:23:12,470
second red box

408
00:23:12,470 --> 00:23:16,860
and then jump directly to the shelter
you see the 1990 1990 there which is

409
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:18,140
like an OPS lead

410
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:21,910
start executing so this is like in
Titanic what everything beyond that gets

411
00:23:21,910 --> 00:23:22,770
executed this

412
00:23:22,770 --> 00:23:27,210
there's no to number this advance like
what chains are in is complicated stuff

413
00:23:27,210 --> 00:23:31,290
you get a ride were immediately BC v2x
bullet on the biggest problem with this

414
00:23:31,290 --> 00:23:32,070
exploit

415
00:23:32,070 --> 00:23:35,340
is that at least half the people using
it

416
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:38,490
have no idea how to find a different
address um

417
00:23:38,490 --> 00:23:43,250
so if you know how these exploits work
you need to have what one

418
00:23:43,250 --> 00:23:47,360
exploit in memory where jobs back to as
a couple of those new do some research

419
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:48,350
inkatha works

420
00:23:48,350 --> 00:23:53,410
we find obviously sometimes only test on
their own version of Windows so

421
00:23:53,410 --> 00:23:56,620
the least half the time the Chinese and
unexplained only works on Chinese

422
00:23:56,620 --> 00:23:58,500
windows even though they sending it to
people in

423
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:02,690
the USA so I am builds automatic now
we're now systems

424
00:24:02,690 --> 00:24:06,140
mind this imply module on a flight
system that part of the whole

425
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:09,240
processing these exploit I called the
explicar pan n

426
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:13,680
that actually i repair the exploits on
able to run to make it work because

427
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:17,670
half the exploits out their conduct low
quality that they want actually work

428
00:24:17,670 --> 00:24:21,960
so is actually wanna the condo thing is
most I'm consuming analyzing the stuff

429
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:24,840
is actually the low quality time with
their exploits

430
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:30,340
arm so RTF was that was passed in 2010
and 2012 actually had a different one

431
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:34,330
actually got the number wrong there on
but isn't actually look at how to trade

432
00:24:34,330 --> 00:24:35,430
wise but

433
00:24:35,430 --> 00:24:38,880
his car with a slight rich text format
lot it's a text format

434
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:42,340
but in the end he actually been other
doc files in it conveyed

435
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:46,610
in bed away leaving big palm missus like
a

436
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:51,040
detect surface here so much infinite ans
this is why we're able to like see this

437
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:51,510
is the

438
00:24:51,510 --> 00:24:56,320
the new the new word exploit that is
actually again more more common

439
00:24:56,320 --> 00:25:00,830
very hot access rights used to deliver
everything under the Sun

440
00:25:00,830 --> 00:25:04,410
arm so this was kinda cool ins that he's
the new one

441
00:25:04,410 --> 00:25:08,720
you probably haven't seen it yet but
this is actually found by

442
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:11,860
myself on my colleagues from airport to
Microsoft

443
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:16,690
I'll just this month and Microsoft
actually put out a fix it on Monday

444
00:25:16,690 --> 00:25:20,100
Ford so we actually found this being
used in the wild

445
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:24,540
by a by now the government are just a
small numbers

446
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:28,920
again only targeting United a very small
number of users but they happen to be

447
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:32,310
journalists on my list as well so that's
why I'm willing to put in this talk

448
00:25:32,310 --> 00:25:36,410
that they again the first places exploit
was used

449
00:25:36,410 --> 00:25:41,260
it looks like was probably purchased but
again it's a very successful exploit

450
00:25:41,260 --> 00:25:44,290
and as gonna they're putting his says
like

451
00:25:44,290 --> 00:25:47,610
is how we could do better 2014 in you
know

452
00:25:47,610 --> 00:25:51,450
opening an RTF file or even possibly
viewing in the preview pane

453
00:25:51,450 --> 00:25:55,760
so expects anybody who's doing this or
to research is gonna see the CB number a

454
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:57,020
lot because

455
00:25:57,020 --> 00:26:01,200
especially now sponsoring public bad on
this can be a lot of copycats on this

456
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:03,150
one because it is very nice exploit

457
00:26:03,150 --> 00:26:06,310
and again used in the wild and

458
00:26:06,310 --> 00:26:10,650
what we're seeing more and more so as a
general pitch on exploits but I'll say

459
00:26:10,650 --> 00:26:12,160
is that

460
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:15,550
a lot on the timing by the government is
amusing exploitable

461
00:26:15,550 --> 00:26:18,580
arm day using

462
00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:22,060
a from the defending the raw files the
same as if files are sending the

463
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:23,570
documents directly

464
00:26:23,570 --> 00:26:28,200
on ans the reason is is that users will
pick on it and we don't have enough

465
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:29,490
protections

466
00:26:29,490 --> 00:26:33,230
on the the next content level we
actually see in me so lucky he sat next

467
00:26:33,230 --> 00:26:34,850
level escalation is

468
00:26:34,850 --> 00:26:39,650
the plot one of the older exploits
because the it's safe and careful spent

469
00:26:39,650 --> 00:26:43,290
but as we thought let's not have fun
that the new ones today

470
00:26:43,290 --> 00:26:47,110
and we had a lot of a bit of success

471
00:26:47,110 --> 00:26:51,170
arm well you know me some my colleague
and stuff from

472
00:26:51,170 --> 00:26:55,190
do other people reporting them that
about we say that with regularity at

473
00:26:55,190 --> 00:26:57,210
least once every three months

474
00:26:57,210 --> 00:27:02,460
we finding a your day it's kinda content
exploit like exploit usually get

475
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:02,950
something like

476
00:27:02,950 --> 00:27:07,260
I E R word and and we see that actually
being Connie

477
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:12,070
used by government actors we report it
get patched and get use more

478
00:27:12,070 --> 00:27:16,360
but week I've clockwork regularity there
are a small number of groups that have

479
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:17,350
these exploits

480
00:27:17,350 --> 00:27:21,570
but the vast majority done so you have
to Hana been lucky targeted by the

481
00:27:21,570 --> 00:27:22,980
Saturday see condition feel

482
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:26,270
on it field on it actually pull one out
for you

483
00:27:26,270 --> 00:27:30,360
and to be honest I don't the button that
high success rate

484
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:33,750
but we definitely say that they are out
there and has definite evidence that

485
00:27:33,750 --> 00:27:34,640
they for sale

486
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:37,880
that is the company's that are actually
on

487
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:41,820
openly selling exploits for government
use as also these black market

488
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:45,130
that we definitely believe her small
number people responsible for

489
00:27:45,130 --> 00:27:48,360
blossom and exploits and 5

490
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:51,980
like the you hope to come to produce
that mark release compete with that

491
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:54,170
market to actually get some base

492
00:27:54,170 --> 00:27:58,240
kinda of the market so

493
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:02,870
how do we actually solve this and I kind
of total journalists of total what

494
00:28:02,870 --> 00:28:04,180
activists

495
00:28:04,180 --> 00:28:08,450
ands the big solution a lot of the time
the community

496
00:28:08,450 --> 00:28:11,910
is actually circumvention tools everyone

497
00:28:11,910 --> 00:28:17,470
jumped to No you know bpm and install
for encryption and PGP

498
00:28:17,470 --> 00:28:21,300
and these are all great tools they
definitely protect against threats

499
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:25,520
definitely really important in terms of
understanding what they are

500
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:29,030
arm I pushed back a little bit it's an
argument at more than I actually have a

501
00:28:29,030 --> 00:28:31,780
little bit about some the second mention
tools is that

502
00:28:31,780 --> 00:28:35,120
it does worry me that I sometimes feel
that they can sprinkle around like magic

503
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:36,000
pixie dust

504
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:40,250
that just go to a website to get some
big list always tools to install

505
00:28:40,250 --> 00:28:44,880
its nice like Windows machine and some
you're installing 10 crime extensions 7

506
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:46,190
proxy tools

507
00:28:46,190 --> 00:28:49,690
you have all these things installed and
in some people believe this site not

508
00:28:49,690 --> 00:28:51,590
really understanding what does like

509
00:28:51,590 --> 00:28:55,220
do people really understand what if you
use toll what does that actually mean

510
00:28:55,220 --> 00:28:57,060
who can see your traffic now

511
00:28:57,060 --> 00:29:02,100
this is who could see a traffic for what
a taxi vulnerable to what a taxi you

512
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:05,280
less possible to what actually more
vulnerable to um

513
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:08,910
the biggest one we're seeing now is
actually back toward circumvention tools

514
00:29:08,910 --> 00:29:12,070
that the sentimental really do work

515
00:29:12,070 --> 00:29:15,690
but as part of that or

516
00:29:15,690 --> 00:29:19,500
missing like a nice new tax surface that
the whole

517
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:23,430
you know installing circumvention tools
is all about

518
00:29:23,430 --> 00:29:26,840
you know many cases these are
distributed through content informal

519
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:28,070
channels

520
00:29:28,070 --> 00:29:31,100
and then suddenly you know

521
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:34,020
you had people installing X ease of
random places on the internet and their

522
00:29:34,020 --> 00:29:34,590
friends

523
00:29:34,590 --> 00:29:37,720
so in this new thing about that's great
you wanna run

524
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:40,810
executables less to send you some
executables look like circumvention

525
00:29:40,810 --> 00:29:43,030
tools are back toward circumvention
tools

526
00:29:43,030 --> 00:29:47,060
a diff within this this to our a simmer
good actually

527
00:29:47,060 --> 00:29:52,650
a Iranian tool has been used to bypass
censorship in Iran since 2009

528
00:29:52,650 --> 00:29:55,890
it's less than a megabyte which is great
because the Internet's not particularly

529
00:29:55,890 --> 00:29:57,330
fast Iran

530
00:29:57,330 --> 00:30:02,120
and it's kind it's very convenient also
passed around a lot by USB because as

531
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:03,000
love this kind of

532
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:06,950
informal sort of things there so

533
00:30:06,950 --> 00:30:09,740
unfortunately the one on the left is
what the real install looks like the

534
00:30:09,740 --> 00:30:10,100
long

535
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:13,380
on the right sorin install

536
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:16,570
his moms gonna lot is like a hole like
install

537
00:30:16,570 --> 00:30:20,110
and these drops a complete like BB now
where

538
00:30:20,110 --> 00:30:23,670
back both machines are suddenly this
user whose trying to get possible ways

539
00:30:23,670 --> 00:30:25,080
like circumvention tools

540
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:29,540
the middle-aged install the back door
directly ans

541
00:30:29,540 --> 00:30:34,510
using his car becoming a trend himself
mid-2013

542
00:30:34,510 --> 00:30:38,230
we saw or the kind of free gay do the
same thing

543
00:30:38,230 --> 00:30:42,520
on of we sold backboard versions a free
day

544
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:45,780
ands on the ins its

545
00:30:45,780 --> 00:30:49,090
being good somehow but actually see this
is a commercial rat

546
00:30:49,090 --> 00:30:53,700
so actually saying that this is parking
they are

547
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:56,940
Syrian opposition and it's actually

548
00:30:56,940 --> 00:31:00,810
the campaign was masquerading as a call
to arms by

549
00:31:00,810 --> 00:31:04,990
mesmerized alarm saying it's always a
little holes and in some intense towards

550
00:31:04,990 --> 00:31:07,230
commercial about

551
00:31:07,230 --> 00:31:10,490
and again told which is kinda

552
00:31:10,490 --> 00:31:14,860
wanna one the most powerful tools people
had to actually protect anonymity

553
00:31:14,860 --> 00:31:19,350
is actually also back toward patients
and that turning up as well

554
00:31:19,350 --> 00:31:23,360
and this was targeted this is seen to be
sent around by a mile

555
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:29,280
arm in you know in with center too bad
news organizations as journalists

556
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:33,010
really and citizen journalists really
kinda worried about the source is why

557
00:31:33,010 --> 00:31:34,460
many connecting to

558
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:37,910
and then getting email be back till
circumvention tools so

559
00:31:37,910 --> 00:31:41,350
this is Connor if again low tech trends
but

560
00:31:41,350 --> 00:31:45,850
identifying Howell weaknesses in their

561
00:31:45,850 --> 00:31:49,270
arm ants to be a little bit closer to

562
00:31:49,270 --> 00:31:53,270
where we currently are are also saying a

563
00:31:53,270 --> 00:31:56,410
United everybody's getting into this
game ans

564
00:31:56,410 --> 00:32:00,290
in Vietnam has been oh and did to me
smile should say

565
00:32:00,290 --> 00:32:04,940
have been very Cana heavily targeted at
a las 12 months

566
00:32:04,940 --> 00:32:08,880
are we've got bloggers upon was targeted

567
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:12,050
kinda early in the year last year and
then be

568
00:32:12,050 --> 00:32:16,680
should machine was totally compromised
but then suddenly as a result

569
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:19,900
personal information in it up online
that misconduct

570
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:24,310
which is in great form of intimidation
like contact details private photos

571
00:32:24,310 --> 00:32:27,840
or on getting out onto the internet
which is you know

572
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:32,160
it definitely has a mechanism to how to
make people think twice about

573
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:36,450
speaking at a blogging and this isn't
just hiding with in vietnam

574
00:32:36,450 --> 00:32:40,420
really comprehensive like the number of
accounts the number all

575
00:32:40,420 --> 00:32:45,150
contest now and being sent out volumes
that you know

576
00:32:45,150 --> 00:32:48,180
almost anything done the Vietnamese
language around the internet that if

577
00:32:48,180 --> 00:32:51,120
you're wanting something the Vietnamese
language a rebate amis

578
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:54,710
expect group eating pot at the enemy's
despite this borough

579
00:32:54,710 --> 00:32:58,210
you really are going to be sent someone
is now where the last 12 months

580
00:32:58,210 --> 00:33:02,800
arm got mathematicians in France if if
blood is in late last year

581
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:05,890
anything UN in talking to reporters at
like

582
00:33:05,890 --> 00:33:10,920
in Altus linking to like system bloggers
but also the Associated Press

583
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:14,400
on so

584
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:18,430
icon talk to meddle in our in stopping
and somehow adding stuff sent out

585
00:33:18,430 --> 00:33:22,990
but color great secret a fly fishing is
like

586
00:33:22,990 --> 00:33:26,180
fishing is actually what I think is the
the seat most serious threat to meet at

587
00:33:26,180 --> 00:33:28,410
the moment which is kinda craving to say
cuz

588
00:33:28,410 --> 00:33:32,170
are you human does Ricky guy and Nels
Cline to exploit Scion

589
00:33:32,170 --> 00:33:36,250
I really did consider especially before
I started Google stunning and open web

590
00:33:36,250 --> 00:33:37,410
stuff is like

591
00:33:37,410 --> 00:33:42,240
you know you can control the IP you can
control the exploit and it's really is

592
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:43,560
lame stuff

593
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:47,540
but in reality the we've moved in this
world now

594
00:33:47,540 --> 00:33:52,630
that I'm getting almost everybody in
this room is able to access

595
00:33:52,630 --> 00:33:56,760
they work systems the personal Systems
from here

596
00:33:56,760 --> 00:34:01,850
and general I think most of the time
you're going to be doing that

597
00:34:01,850 --> 00:34:05,150
through credentials so you can get
credentials

598
00:34:05,150 --> 00:34:10,610
you don't need one and machine and some
weekend June 2011 as we actually sold

599
00:34:10,610 --> 00:34:12,190
that

600
00:34:12,190 --> 00:34:16,370
really comprehensive targeting that
Google identified as being specifically

601
00:34:16,370 --> 00:34:18,080
from Jinan China

602
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:22,410
and he was actually timing the personal
accounts to

603
00:34:22,410 --> 00:34:27,620
all individuals so he said and doing
very many media figures he is well as

604
00:34:27,620 --> 00:34:31,550
military figures as well as some very
senior US officials and US government

605
00:34:31,550 --> 00:34:32,610
types

606
00:34:32,610 --> 00:34:36,610
ans again you can if you contact Google

607
00:34:36,610 --> 00:34:41,930
trick the user for the credentials econ
get home I he contact Microsoft

608
00:34:41,930 --> 00:34:45,810
treaties for the credentials and then in
many cases that will get you everything

609
00:34:45,810 --> 00:34:46,680
you need to know

610
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:51,290
remember these professionals these ons
about china cup of the pool hack

611
00:34:51,290 --> 00:34:54,950
always guys want is the information in
the account they actually want this

612
00:34:54,950 --> 00:34:55,710
information

613
00:34:55,710 --> 00:34:58,930
they want the contacts they want social
information and more more this

614
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:00,920
information is online in some ways

615
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:04,410
or is available online if they can get
access the credentials

616
00:35:04,410 --> 00:35:07,710
so this is actually pretty well
engineered this is one which is found

617
00:35:07,710 --> 00:35:11,010
last week arm thanks in advance

618
00:35:11,010 --> 00:35:15,050
really close like Italy pixel perfect
except for the

619
00:35:15,050 --> 00:35:20,160
a eurobabe on exactly like what to do
the login page looks like these days

620
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:23,610
ans this is being sent out

621
00:35:23,610 --> 00:35:29,720
hobbles the credentials they move on
Alsip ill try and access the accounts

622
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:33,320
um and I take it was really good

623
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:36,410
at really got a fishing these days is

624
00:35:36,410 --> 00:35:39,460
group points also suing outright army

625
00:35:39,460 --> 00:35:44,190
om they are I'll comprehensively getting
into Twitter accounts

626
00:35:44,190 --> 00:35:48,140
they were able to compromise Microsoft
employees and get specific information

627
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:50,380
about the legal processes

628
00:35:50,380 --> 00:35:53,410
and just across the border soon I'll try
calming and

629
00:35:53,410 --> 00:35:56,670
the Syrian group which is you

630
00:35:56,670 --> 00:36:00,400
expressing their support for on Assad

631
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:05,380
is that they we haven't actually seen
plan now with any more advanced than

632
00:36:05,380 --> 00:36:07,040
anything they can download from the net
for

633
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:12,290
least free or fifty dollars but there in
some ways point a big tax than anyone

634
00:36:12,290 --> 00:36:13,040
else's

635
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:16,260
just by tricking people from the
credentials so is a good the gray one

636
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:17,710
from

637
00:36:17,710 --> 00:36:22,320
a just the a few months back

638
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:25,540
where and actually managed to get the
Associated Press Twitter account

639
00:36:25,540 --> 00:36:29,930
actually said two explosions in the
white house back Obama is injured

640
00:36:29,930 --> 00:36:33,440
and then immediately from one to the
other ones it was able to do it so

641
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:37,780
wanna thank you think it has a well
besides being con- very funny

642
00:36:37,780 --> 00:36:41,590
is that like looking this shot on

643
00:36:41,590 --> 00:36:45,680
that's actually the Dow Jones Industrial
Average

644
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:48,960
like that immediate did their represents
like

645
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:54,150
1 percent all the value of the US stock
market as an instantaneous drop in

646
00:36:54,150 --> 00:36:57,730
trading by so that probably repeat that
represents

647
00:36:57,730 --> 00:37:01,460
get back in the envelope probably about
you know the network cable companies

648
00:37:01,460 --> 00:37:02,390
intend to trading

649
00:37:02,390 --> 00:37:07,090
like does a 150 billion dollar drop in
terms of what US companies worth

650
00:37:07,090 --> 00:37:10,700
said you could actually trade on that
information all kind of do something

651
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:11,390
wrong will be

652
00:37:11,390 --> 00:37:15,690
little bit more subtle on what they did
on you can have some pretty interesting

653
00:37:15,690 --> 00:37:18,830
affects and is kinda a small group

654
00:37:18,830 --> 00:37:22,400
fishing people potentials having in a
I'm sure some people had some horrible

655
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:23,210
trades on that

656
00:37:23,210 --> 00:37:27,260
and some people doing automatic trading
probably it a lost or gained a lot of

657
00:37:27,260 --> 00:37:28,430
money in that little spot

658
00:37:28,430 --> 00:37:33,760
day every time the market need some some
hot a try to wins or loses

659
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:37,220
um I really he gets all fishing if I had

660
00:37:37,220 --> 00:37:40,650
like all things and fix in the world

661
00:37:40,650 --> 00:37:44,060
um I think actually fishing is actually
the first 1i think all with

662
00:37:44,060 --> 00:37:48,800
other solution systems beyond that only
gonna go away

663
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:52,490
when we can stop using trick for the
credentials we've actually seen this

664
00:37:52,490 --> 00:37:53,390
stuff like

665
00:37:53,390 --> 00:37:58,010
and a that this in this town for booking
engine on group is actually interesting

666
00:37:58,010 --> 00:38:00,170
the vision on group that we actually saw

667
00:38:00,170 --> 00:38:03,930
doing fishing at a high level officials
they also said that malware

668
00:38:03,930 --> 00:38:07,440
we actually sold to make decisions in
terms of you know

669
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:11,240
if the economy online presence they got
fishing if it's on it what of wine so

670
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:15,150
people with Connor mind rhyme L councils
and now it's this kind of balance

671
00:38:15,150 --> 00:38:18,970
all Klein is they see that fishing is at
least up there is a

672
00:38:18,970 --> 00:38:22,460
Balan waaye attacking just as much as
malware exploits

673
00:38:22,460 --> 00:38:25,560
but never treated smart has never
treated the same way it's not change the

674
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:27,270
same respect in a black hat conference

675
00:38:27,270 --> 00:38:30,340
as Condit some cool new exploit but

676
00:38:30,340 --> 00:38:34,950
it can be different acceptable we r in
common do list moving trying to move

677
00:38:34,950 --> 00:38:36,030
beyond passwords

678
00:38:36,030 --> 00:38:40,040
and password for dead on two-factor
authentication and try and verify

679
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:41,310
identities

680
00:38:41,310 --> 00:38:46,000
on and more people moving towards is the
whole point a two-factor authentication

681
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:50,240
hope we all love you run some former to
fit factor authentication is that

682
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:54,350
you don't just what the password on it
especially important for password for

683
00:38:54,350 --> 00:38:55,570
use cause we see

684
00:38:55,570 --> 00:38:59,090
a lot of these attacks on Twitter
accounts all things is but get one past

685
00:38:59,090 --> 00:39:00,910
would have to take you into this

686
00:39:00,910 --> 00:39:04,420
and everybody uses the same password
everywhere else addition saw the prime

687
00:39:04,420 --> 00:39:05,860
well people hack

688
00:39:05,860 --> 00:39:09,610
you know some crazy little website men
in PHP even by like

689
00:39:09,610 --> 00:39:14,030
two guys who've never done security its
deal all possible database no use it

690
00:39:14,030 --> 00:39:14,790
against Google

691
00:39:14,790 --> 00:39:19,150
where we have pretty good security and
it works and simile

692
00:39:19,150 --> 00:39:22,210
if you get somebody's personal account
it probably matches the Twitter account

693
00:39:22,210 --> 00:39:22,940
and

694
00:39:22,940 --> 00:39:26,680
we've seen economy moves that way so too
is deprecated important

695
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:31,000
but the next kind of it still falls down
that you can be triggered by the second

696
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:31,470
back to

697
00:39:31,470 --> 00:39:37,260
on and so duels actually said that the
trying to move beyond

698
00:39:37,260 --> 00:39:41,180
just password to something him a treat
for I think the real solution to this is

699
00:39:41,180 --> 00:39:44,070
you have to create something the user
cannot be tricked out of providing

700
00:39:44,070 --> 00:39:48,370
because users will always be tricked
into providing credentials

701
00:39:48,370 --> 00:39:52,050
on we've done rent aims to dump and
tests

702
00:39:52,050 --> 00:39:56,580
arm when I Sindhu Penn tests generally
we end up getting banned from using

703
00:39:56,580 --> 00:39:57,180
fishing

704
00:39:57,180 --> 00:40:00,940
because vision people for trades just
work every time and improved improve

705
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:01,440
anything

706
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:04,630
it's like yeah we know fishing works it
works again security people

707
00:40:04,630 --> 00:40:09,090
work against engineers work against PhD
works against moms and dads

708
00:40:09,090 --> 00:40:12,250
if you say not enough fishing will work

709
00:40:12,250 --> 00:40:15,870
so um pissing on the is an early
prototype have something

710
00:40:15,870 --> 00:40:19,420
google said they're working on its I
call security key

711
00:40:19,420 --> 00:40:23,320
is actually and said I just want to
include like some the UK's at the moment

712
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:27,350
it actually has crypto in it and
cuddling seem to the crime browse on

713
00:40:27,350 --> 00:40:31,270
with an open standard would actually
seems like a signed

714
00:40:31,270 --> 00:40:34,360
thing to to do the login process so

715
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:39,170
I have on one here only sticks out like
literally a millimeter out my

716
00:40:39,170 --> 00:40:43,180
machine but every time I log in I have
to touch that

717
00:40:43,180 --> 00:40:46,990
and then it actually kinda confirms but
if I was in that paper website

718
00:40:46,990 --> 00:40:50,160
there's no way for that fake website is
no longer look onto

719
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:53,260
treatment oppressing doesn't matter if I
present on another web site

720
00:40:53,260 --> 00:40:58,300
and I think niece makes you relatively
on fishable and google said it like

721
00:40:58,300 --> 00:41:01,320
try and if we try to push this out into
on Nov

722
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:04,840
lease or some variant to it to consumers
as quick as possible because

723
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:08,450
I think people who is under attack on
journalists and others really need a

724
00:41:08,450 --> 00:41:09,490
solution

725
00:41:09,490 --> 00:41:13,600
not being able to be tricked because
user education is always pull up as a

726
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:14,450
panacea

727
00:41:14,450 --> 00:41:17,660
but on it user education is

728
00:41:17,660 --> 00:41:22,340
a nice thing but where engineers we can
do better

729
00:41:22,340 --> 00:41:27,900
um so all the presentation xkcd comic

730
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:33,910
um so

731
00:41:33,910 --> 00:41:37,830
is coming talked about how yeah let's
let's break our sales to the middle is

732
00:41:37,830 --> 00:41:38,470
great

733
00:41:38,470 --> 00:41:41,470
wake when attacks but the five-dollar
ranch

734
00:41:41,470 --> 00:41:44,810
um and I read MinuteClinic a while back

735
00:41:44,810 --> 00:41:48,300
but a lot of the work that more than
I've done dealing with these people and

736
00:41:48,300 --> 00:41:50,620
dealing with journalists and dealing
with bloggers and what

737
00:41:50,620 --> 00:41:54,050
always oppressive regimes in the world
is economies in a comic

738
00:41:54,050 --> 00:41:57,070
missus in a comment below these people
who many possible world

739
00:41:57,070 --> 00:42:01,640
arm you know i'd definitely have sat
down with sat down with you single

740
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:05,700
like the reports for standard you know
they were held they were tortured

741
00:42:05,700 --> 00:42:09,720
their me regimes in the world way like
your higher on your like a blogger

742
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:12,940
you definitely can get like rated and
picked up off the streets

743
00:42:12,940 --> 00:42:15,990
and the first-hand reports coming from

744
00:42:15,990 --> 00:42:19,060
pontiff that puddled specially is that

745
00:42:19,060 --> 00:42:22,560
you know one thing so I ask you for now
is your Hotmail password to Gmail

746
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:24,740
password you picked a case

747
00:42:24,740 --> 00:42:28,350
and this definitely needs to actually
all into al

748
00:42:28,350 --> 00:42:32,280
security model like what you have to
take these people in terms of like how

749
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:35,000
do you limit damage in most cases
because

750
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:38,000
Anne Moller breaks down a five dollar
range

751
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:41,650
really doesn't work ans it something
that you

752
00:42:41,650 --> 00:42:45,420
%uh do like he is actually talked about
in terms of like the next uses

753
00:42:45,420 --> 00:42:48,750
would get as they grow in the world with
and his me turn to the Internet in

754
00:42:48,750 --> 00:42:49,680
general it

755
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:52,780
you know the first billion or two
billion uses a condom on the internet

756
00:42:52,780 --> 00:42:53,190
now

757
00:42:53,190 --> 00:42:57,050
generally from the first world generally
from relatively

758
00:42:57,050 --> 00:43:01,400
stable regimes in the whole definitely
don't have what you that much

759
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:05,370
kinda you know not new is bad and you
talk about the developing world

760
00:43:05,370 --> 00:43:08,220
you talk about what the remaining four
billion people that are really coming

761
00:43:08,220 --> 00:43:09,150
online

762
00:43:09,150 --> 00:43:12,720
many that people are coming on line from
places don't have the same love war

763
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:16,570
that had the same physical safety then
had the same civil institutions

764
00:43:16,570 --> 00:43:20,000
so time to challenge this I putting ends
the same

765
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:23,310
everybody's the chinese input all
security professionals is how do you

766
00:43:23,310 --> 00:43:25,170
build security systems

767
00:43:25,170 --> 00:43:30,180
that Conniff gonna work for people and
those kinda unstable places

768
00:43:30,180 --> 00:43:33,540
as well as a works for people Conniff
who actually do have the protection

769
00:43:33,540 --> 00:43:34,360
award for

770
00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:37,300
a officials say is the whole but
anything before I just point to other

771
00:43:37,300 --> 00:43:38,290
parts of the world

772
00:43:38,290 --> 00:43:41,380
is that um

773
00:43:41,380 --> 00:43:44,520
you know this we have a pretty good
example recently that

774
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:49,340
the modern journalists can beat detained
anywhere the as we saw

775
00:43:49,340 --> 00:43:53,860
I with Miranda who are when Graeme old
partner who is working with him

776
00:43:53,860 --> 00:43:56,890
on the snowed in leaks way

777
00:43:56,890 --> 00:44:00,250
he was just transiting through Heathrow
and he was detained for the

778
00:44:00,250 --> 00:44:03,400
nine hours under terrorism provisions of
the US

779
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:08,040
you cable anti-noise media electronic
devices whose

780
00:44:08,040 --> 00:44:11,230
detained in question for nine hours and

781
00:44:11,230 --> 00:44:15,960
this is like August last year ands you
know you was appealed the went to the

782
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:16,520
High Court

783
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:21,280
UK and actually ruled that he was a a
valid use it was okay for them to use

784
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:24,010
these terrorism wars 2 detained for nine
hours so

785
00:44:24,010 --> 00:44:28,740
if you're a journalist I you know it's
it's not just ironic that you aren't

786
00:44:28,740 --> 00:44:30,250
about condoms your

787
00:44:30,250 --> 00:44:34,040
security of your information is like is
connecting to heathrow is well

788
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:34,680
apparently

789
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:40,060
so decline if be healthy paranoia i
spose

790
00:44:40,060 --> 00:44:43,920
and he'd if we had like laptop mobile
phone and memory cards all taken from

791
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:45,700
internet on

792
00:44:45,700 --> 00:44:49,900
on losses on talk about as I

793
00:44:49,900 --> 00:44:52,940
yeltsin the encourage it does the

794
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:56,490
ok why the revolution will be televised
and it's becoming very true the

795
00:44:56,490 --> 00:44:58,250
revolution will be televised on YouTube

796
00:44:58,250 --> 00:45:01,770
we've seen it to the Arab Spring should
Syrian civil war

797
00:45:01,770 --> 00:45:05,360
and that definitely makes kinda you
choose to be 100 battleground

798
00:45:05,360 --> 00:45:08,920
arm up recent remarks they say is like

799
00:45:08,920 --> 00:45:12,850
social media business social media and
is Alexis and put out by the console

800
00:45:12,850 --> 00:45:14,540
Syrians on YouTube

801
00:45:14,540 --> 00:45:18,430
and still have like a lot more follows
the Cyprus odd

802
00:45:18,430 --> 00:45:22,390
they the accused the opposition of being
terrorists ans

803
00:45:22,390 --> 00:45:26,660
bed this page here is what they're doing
is actually playing out opposition

804
00:45:26,660 --> 00:45:29,460
videos that is documenting violence on
YouTube

805
00:45:29,460 --> 00:45:33,300
and documenting Connor what reported to
be abused by the Assad regime

806
00:45:33,300 --> 00:45:36,820
at the same day bow to you she fly
mister

807
00:45:36,820 --> 00:45:40,360
or tell us as well current a content

808
00:45:40,360 --> 00:45:44,010
and tell us is terrorism so they're
actually climbed getting all that

809
00:45:44,010 --> 00:45:48,020
all is on their side to go in our poll
the opposition's kind of

810
00:45:48,020 --> 00:45:51,060
videos terrorist videos so I kinda
abusing

811
00:45:51,060 --> 00:45:54,580
this whole process this is actually kind
of

812
00:45:54,580 --> 00:45:57,580
tough to deal with it like he had his
whole burden to

813
00:45:57,580 --> 00:46:01,800
how do you actually maintain free
expression while also con- it actually

814
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:05,760
maintaining the car censorship in
responsibility to not have terrorism

815
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:09,530
and you keep up with the whole burden on
the system

816
00:46:09,530 --> 00:46:13,040
and the other way we see on in
journalism being targeted is

817
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:17,410
Jost what you say say it is really
causes like to get his perfidy this in

818
00:46:17,410 --> 00:46:18,490
your life

819
00:46:18,490 --> 00:46:21,910
so he's actually in Turkey last week arm
so

820
00:46:21,910 --> 00:46:25,890
turkey decided to blocked with up
because people in Turkey where

821
00:46:25,890 --> 00:46:30,620
documenting the water a corruption and
other bad thing supposedly being done by

822
00:46:30,620 --> 00:46:31,560
the Turkish government

823
00:46:31,560 --> 00:46:36,480
so instead of a so the parking around
same though doing it

824
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:39,920
Bailey naively though doing at the DNS
lasso

825
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:43,610
rusty like putting up graffiti just say
go to Google

826
00:46:43,610 --> 00:46:47,730
DNS you'll get through it when it that
way I just this week

827
00:46:47,730 --> 00:46:51,080
that I'll take its government is now
blocking you choose well because there's

828
00:46:51,080 --> 00:46:52,300
always YouTube videos so

829
00:46:52,300 --> 00:46:55,680
this is the other thread and kinda a
different thread journalists but

830
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:59,230
you know the the threaded just actually
being blocked or taken down so

831
00:46:59,230 --> 00:47:03,210
is with circumvention tools and the
conduct maintaining the Internet upon is

832
00:47:03,210 --> 00:47:05,520
also important

833
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:10,340
on and had another crazy threats uniform
for journalists that has been

834
00:47:10,340 --> 00:47:14,860
important this is again just in the last
week or two

835
00:47:14,860 --> 00:47:18,280
ants start a lot of debate is that

836
00:47:18,280 --> 00:47:22,870
this case was arm so Microsoft had

837
00:47:22,870 --> 00:47:26,030
I'll employed at like late some

838
00:47:26,030 --> 00:47:29,990
information about Windows release that
lead to a journalist blogger

839
00:47:29,990 --> 00:47:35,100
and its so it actually did the coal
fines 10 things they did is that the

840
00:47:35,100 --> 00:47:35,570
blog

841
00:47:35,570 --> 00:47:40,090
journalist was actually hosting the had
email on hotmail

842
00:47:40,090 --> 00:47:44,240
and so they can identify the employees
didn't make it

843
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:48,180
but Marcus of actually used the
provision which kind out to be legal to

844
00:47:48,180 --> 00:47:49,450
protect Microsoft

845
00:47:49,450 --> 00:47:52,920
but they're actually able to actually
pulled the journal's mailbox

846
00:47:52,920 --> 00:47:56,050
in order to identify the source against
microsoft

847
00:47:56,050 --> 00:47:59,080
so this is you got a lot about right
shin

848
00:47:59,080 --> 00:48:02,270
and nobody said that the legal I've done
but

849
00:48:02,270 --> 00:48:05,390
it's definitely a threat to public thing
to journalist and thing called being

850
00:48:05,390 --> 00:48:05,970
like

851
00:48:05,970 --> 00:48:09,650
you know journalists reporting on
Microsoft something Microsoft is going

852
00:48:09,650 --> 00:48:10,440
to be meeting

853
00:48:10,440 --> 00:48:13,810
email because of this arm so

854
00:48:13,810 --> 00:48:17,350
again this so many different threats out
there and

855
00:48:17,350 --> 00:48:22,460
requires a lot of new wants to work out
who your adversary is

856
00:48:22,460 --> 00:48:26,240
arm so trying to be very quick summary

857
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:30,190
are a pint how I see the regional
variation on time

858
00:48:30,190 --> 00:48:33,240
just doing this of the CAF is that

859
00:48:33,240 --> 00:48:36,860
me see the whole gamut spectrum out and
talked about all of them that we see

860
00:48:36,860 --> 00:48:38,260
there is the

861
00:48:38,260 --> 00:48:41,970
this the inkatha below in Middle East
guys

862
00:48:41,970 --> 00:48:46,710
although africans or whatever they've
gone they bought their client tools from

863
00:48:46,710 --> 00:48:49,910
ganar the ball the fin fish in that both
the Rossi s

864
00:48:49,910 --> 00:48:54,980
and is sending it out they pretty low
ends but they working

865
00:48:54,980 --> 00:48:58,030
and it definitely works and then you
step up and then

866
00:48:58,030 --> 00:49:03,000
elsewhere you see like the not thinking
on the electric obviously

867
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:06,820
around are Iranian Trigon issuing I try
tommie

868
00:49:06,820 --> 00:49:11,200
if you Bayer target you you really gotta
watch after being fished didn't

869
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:14,550
some the best social engineers in the
world they will play they will really

870
00:49:14,550 --> 00:49:17,670
work out will present your buttons they
will trick you into something

871
00:49:17,670 --> 00:49:20,880
they really know how to play the system
and then

872
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:24,280
you move up to clio you know

873
00:49:24,280 --> 00:49:27,610
you are on your Tunisia I mention this
in detail

874
00:49:27,610 --> 00:49:32,210
near the kind of place are looking at
Mina fake penis certificates actually

875
00:49:32,210 --> 00:49:35,070
meant a middling actually using the
infrastructure to control the

876
00:49:35,070 --> 00:49:36,510
journalists

877
00:49:36,510 --> 00:49:40,510
and then does the what a pleasant and
just about to be like

878
00:49:40,510 --> 00:49:44,230
your China's or whatever which actually
had a comprehensive programs both

879
00:49:44,230 --> 00:49:45,250
military

880
00:49:45,250 --> 00:49:50,040
and skydive civilian really timing but
state national security

881
00:49:50,040 --> 00:49:53,420
and they will just comprehensively go
out to all the different targets

882
00:49:53,420 --> 00:49:59,020
and then you obviously have the the west
and what's being removed male dog like

883
00:49:59,020 --> 00:50:02,100
you know they had the ability to like
these warrants

884
00:50:02,100 --> 00:50:06,700
compel and with all the spine and also
even you know detained journalists

885
00:50:06,700 --> 00:50:10,720
so this is variation in capability
all-white along the spectrum

886
00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:13,820
of the really naive to university
students

887
00:50:13,820 --> 00:50:18,830
to like you know the APT 1 went on a
building in Shanghai which has like

888
00:50:18,830 --> 00:50:22,370
mortal for so professionally trained
operators and

889
00:50:22,370 --> 00:50:26,270
we really are seeing everything from you
know really naive

890
00:50:26,270 --> 00:50:29,770
rock while XE net through to I A

891
00:50:29,770 --> 00:50:33,640
you know zero-day RTF document that
nobody knows anything about

892
00:50:33,640 --> 00:50:37,540
always see the you know flash one
ability which allows

893
00:50:37,540 --> 00:50:41,760
you know to take over anybody's chain
told the unpatched holy cross platform

894
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:45,990
so the range of threats and I think
wants a 10 journalists

895
00:50:45,990 --> 00:50:49,310
is you know no who you're dealing with

896
00:50:49,310 --> 00:50:53,560
and off-site think about what sort of
threats and he let me go against what

897
00:50:53,560 --> 00:50:54,960
omitted operation is

898
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:58,000
and that's kinda why I deleted threat
intelligence that

899
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:01,080
three intelligence doesn't actually sold
the problem

900
00:51:01,080 --> 00:51:04,470
allows you have like some rough idea
what you're facing unless you know what

901
00:51:04,470 --> 00:51:06,150
to do

902
00:51:06,150 --> 00:51:10,370
are so that the timing are just gives
one more indication if

903
00:51:10,370 --> 00:51:16,490
how prevalent is I'll his allister the
election top 25 new sites

904
00:51:16,490 --> 00:51:20,860
ants more when I put together like the
databases and access to and what we know

905
00:51:20,860 --> 00:51:23,140
state-sponsored attacks were able to

906
00:51:23,140 --> 00:51:27,000
between is work out that we can
definitively

907
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:31,880
say that we believe we've seen least 21
at the top 25 you thoughts

908
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:35,410
targeted by state-sponsored attacks in
some form

909
00:51:35,410 --> 00:51:39,100
ans thats prior so

910
00:51:39,100 --> 00:51:46,100
if you are in journalism you are going
to be targeted am so

911
00:51:46,430 --> 00:51:49,470
I a.m. briefers say had a soulless

912
00:51:49,470 --> 00:51:53,400
me johnnie we need to go back into this
being important part of a job I think

913
00:51:53,400 --> 00:51:54,350
journalists

914
00:51:54,350 --> 00:51:57,560
have kind of a got back in the Detroit
guys these guys how do you know

915
00:51:57,560 --> 00:52:00,940
dead letter drops though doing serious
plaintive

916
00:52:00,940 --> 00:52:04,360
off-the-cuff though doing like to use of
sect really sort is this

917
00:52:04,360 --> 00:52:07,760
I think this is feeling now that you
know up computers a hard

918
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:11,290
I majored in English in college I'm
gonna rotting stuff but really if you

919
00:52:11,290 --> 00:52:12,540
want to get into this game

920
00:52:12,540 --> 00:52:16,090
you are going to be targeted and you
don't need to be talking about something

921
00:52:16,090 --> 00:52:17,950
really sophisticated meet our data

922
00:52:17,950 --> 00:52:21,130
like if you touch eating into
international relations

923
00:52:21,130 --> 00:52:24,410
at all you're going to be tied in some
ways

924
00:52:24,410 --> 00:52:27,710
security industry I'm really didn't like
the keynote

925
00:52:27,710 --> 00:52:30,790
I think we need to do that up we need to
build systems that

926
00:52:30,790 --> 00:52:35,170
I'll secure by default on I think the
economy

927
00:52:35,170 --> 00:52:38,770
holding up their hands and say I thought
user education uses being smart I i

928
00:52:38,770 --> 00:52:39,970
think is

929
00:52:39,970 --> 00:52:43,200
con una copia I think we can build
system better than people having to

930
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:43,590
download

931
00:52:43,590 --> 00:52:46,630
X's of the way in double clicking on
them we can make it

932
00:52:46,630 --> 00:52:50,000
so you don't have to think about every
single document you open

933
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:53,380
and governments yeah

934
00:52:53,380 --> 00:52:57,660
nothing can be nice if someone trying to
pretend to be good guys every so often I

935
00:52:57,660 --> 00:52:58,080
think

936
00:52:58,080 --> 00:53:02,120
this year has been everybody is seeded
the home the moral high ground on the

937
00:53:02,120 --> 00:53:03,960
hacking efforts at the moment so

938
00:53:03,960 --> 00:53:06,890
it's hard for any government to point
the finger at any other government seems

939
00:53:06,890 --> 00:53:08,720
like everyone is doing a lacking

940
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:14,060
I am I think I'll call Chris they aren't
adopt any questions about

941
00:53:14,060 --> 00:53:17,100
akio journalists were intelligent so

942
00:53:17,100 --> 00:53:24,100
random opinions on things

943
00:53:30,090 --> 00:53:33,430
so we don't we don't go into specifics

944
00:53:33,430 --> 00:53:36,880
support for good reason exactly how
identify all of them so

945
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:39,940
it's pretty much the some all

946
00:53:39,940 --> 00:53:42,980
everything we've seen through

947
00:53:42,980 --> 00:53:47,770
or detection mechanisms economy goes
into a three intelligence systems

948
00:53:47,770 --> 00:53:52,700
ans we able to condo all the tax we see
in all things we detect

949
00:53:52,700 --> 00:53:56,240
were able to make a pretty good
determination

950
00:53:56,240 --> 00:53:59,710
based on to the timing what links to

951
00:53:59,710 --> 00:54:03,240
who's being targeted in cana like with
%uh categorizing

952
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:06,470
you can control the lines of what had
this looks like sought a crime

953
00:54:06,470 --> 00:54:09,630
ya be deciding journalists and Tibetans

954
00:54:09,630 --> 00:54:13,890
you know put that in the put that in the
constant on settling definitely pot this

955
00:54:13,890 --> 00:54:15,510
was specific attack a group so

956
00:54:15,510 --> 00:54:19,120
without banditry specifics and doesn't
mean they're actually it

957
00:54:19,120 --> 00:54:22,550
they were top they were compromised it
just means that we saw indications that

958
00:54:22,550 --> 00:54:23,380
were targeted

959
00:54:23,380 --> 00:54:30,380
so

960
00:54:34,350 --> 00:54:36,260
so yeah

961
00:54:36,260 --> 00:54:39,660
absolutely um good we have

962
00:54:39,660 --> 00:54:43,070
we've been to google has been doing a
huge matter deficit Ryan

963
00:54:43,070 --> 00:54:46,750
protect against internal threats ans
wanna

964
00:54:46,750 --> 00:54:49,980
wanna things we do realize we have what
data and while things is that there's a

965
00:54:49,980 --> 00:54:51,600
whole bunch atrocity to place their

966
00:54:51,600 --> 00:54:55,370
so internally with a lot of things and
putting everything on links between

967
00:54:55,370 --> 00:54:58,720
but internally we really have been naw

968
00:54:58,720 --> 00:55:02,170
treating people on the inside is trusted
so we

969
00:55:02,170 --> 00:55:05,460
try to create systems where there's like
a single why to access the data

970
00:55:05,460 --> 00:55:08,950
distorting cryptid has a godless
specific brokaw

971
00:55:08,950 --> 00:55:13,220
every single transaction is logged only
upon a number people had access to you

972
00:55:13,220 --> 00:55:14,320
today it is not like

973
00:55:14,320 --> 00:55:18,950
only a very tiny number Google employees
a specific needs very granular controls

974
00:55:18,950 --> 00:55:23,030
and then all access is logged so we try
and create this system way

975
00:55:23,030 --> 00:55:27,620
we have one good employees

976
00:55:27,620 --> 00:55:32,300
and we have systems that climate
minimize access and and what the access

977
00:55:32,300 --> 00:55:32,750
and then

978
00:55:32,750 --> 00:55:36,960
having people to actually order has been
a massive growth invest in both security

979
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:38,610
and privacy across that

980
00:55:38,610 --> 00:55:42,990
am just trying to eyeball that and I'm
in that's what I think all we can do

981
00:55:42,990 --> 00:55:46,210
that hopefully and we believe that we
can actually

982
00:55:46,210 --> 00:55:50,560
have some trust in the system that pace
the week we'll catch people if there is

983
00:55:50,560 --> 00:55:54,130
internal abuse and we absolutely
minimize the potential for abuse but

984
00:55:54,130 --> 00:56:01,130
people

985
00:56:18,490 --> 00:56:22,280
up

986
00:56:22,280 --> 00:56:25,180
I

987
00:56:25,180 --> 00:56:27,170
so I and going I

988
00:56:27,170 --> 00:56:31,089
are why we got a little bit too much
like me I and

989
00:56:31,089 --> 00:56:34,089
I'm different security team and if it
speaking in general research he has

990
00:56:34,089 --> 00:56:36,660
posted by being the official Google
spokesperson everything

991
00:56:36,660 --> 00:56:41,069
on by yeah I know today is a general
principle is that one is to

992
00:56:41,069 --> 00:56:45,650
would to not want to we should all the
day we need to log in one today this

993
00:56:45,650 --> 00:56:46,329
useful

994
00:56:46,329 --> 00:56:49,599
and not a luddite up at him without
going to bike I the North Pacific and

995
00:56:49,599 --> 00:56:50,410
you're talking about

996
00:56:50,410 --> 00:56:57,089
terms of what we should be looking this
is what we are me

997
00:56:57,089 --> 00:57:04,089
questions am up

998
00:57:14,190 --> 00:57:21,190
up

999
00:57:37,570 --> 00:57:41,890
I guess so the best place simply point
you too as they are transparent report

1000
00:57:41,890 --> 00:57:46,650
I'll which we actually the transparency
put actually shows one

1001
00:57:46,650 --> 00:57:51,140
what government request we get from what
countries and in what cases the data is

1002
00:57:51,140 --> 00:57:51,780
provided

1003
00:57:51,780 --> 00:57:57,560
on generally that and it actually has
the Count I don't even know symposium at

1004
00:57:57,560 --> 00:57:58,510
least there's only so

1005
00:57:58,510 --> 00:58:02,510
yes oh that's nice a number companies
the countries that we will actually

1006
00:58:02,510 --> 00:58:03,910
accept legal process from

1007
00:58:03,910 --> 00:58:07,730
and that's generally because they
actually have I'll

1008
00:58:07,730 --> 00:58:11,470
compatible legal systems I'm not the
expert on that and if we pointed

1009
00:58:11,470 --> 00:58:13,920
transparent report depreciation way we

1010
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:17,630
where we do and do not provide data but
generally the the biggest criticism is

1011
00:58:17,630 --> 00:58:18,770
we don't provide nearly

1012
00:58:18,770 --> 00:58:23,400
as much data as people expect or want
and in many cases we do not want to

1013
00:58:23,400 --> 00:58:30,020
and definitely are released all the
countries we do provide data to

1014
00:58:30,020 --> 00:58:36,020
so you can you can work it out which
ones we don't either easily and yes oh

1015
00:58:36,020 --> 00:58:36,440
and

1016
00:58:36,440 --> 00:58:40,130
if you look like you know the room the
repressive regimes on bare when like

1017
00:58:40,130 --> 00:58:41,070
this does not like

1018
00:58:41,070 --> 00:58:44,640
United Syria is not providing is court
orders and getting data from us

1019
00:58:44,640 --> 00:58:49,420
pope

1020
00:58:49,420 --> 00:58:50,270
thanks very much
