1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,410
it's gonna be my pleasure to introduce
to you Greg fun who is the

2
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:07,560
the asia-pacific security a business
leader

3
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:12,030
a Juniper Networks one of our sponsors
that's I had a long time history

4
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:17,000
with black cat over the years many
speakers and even employees a black cat

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,190
have worked for juniper

6
00:00:18,190 --> 00:00:22,090
and they've had a really excellent
business supporting the region for over

7
00:00:22,090 --> 00:00:23,289
15 years

8
00:00:23,289 --> 00:00:26,460
so to thank them for all the support

9
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:29,619
I'd like to invite great but come up
here in and welcome I saw

10
00:00:29,619 --> 00:00:36,619
so thank you thank you Jeff and good
morning everybody

11
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:41,950
it's certainly a pleasure to be here and
if I look back at the

12
00:00:41,950 --> 00:00:47,789
the last year also 2013 it's been a very
tough time for this part of the world

13
00:00:47,789 --> 00:00:51,360
been a tough time for the digital
economy we've seen

14
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:54,820
many bad actors play out over the last
year or so

15
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:58,020
an increasing number about cyberattacks
and

16
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:01,850
other attacks against the digital
economy and economies broadly

17
00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:05,939
last year I'm a gentleman by name is
Edward snowed in

18
00:01:05,939 --> 00:01:09,180
expose a lot of things that I guess
people

19
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:12,400
really you but had never really spoken
about in the public

20
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:16,729
it means that you've got some
governments now trying to balance the

21
00:01:16,729 --> 00:01:18,080
the need between

22
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:21,460
securing their economy and protecting
the privacy

23
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:26,950
also Deira I'm of the constituency
obviously that's a difficult thing to do

24
00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:31,430
and even in this part of the world in
Singapore would not be immune from

25
00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:34,530
attacks against at digital
infrastructure with many

26
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:39,140
government organizations and ministries
being attacked in 2013

27
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:43,939
2014 will be no different it's a
pleasure to be here

28
00:01:43,939 --> 00:01:48,409
at a place like black hat supporting the
industry that helped keep

29
00:01:48,409 --> 00:01:51,430
out digital infrastructure and other
infrastructure

30
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:55,000
protected I look at the the overall

31
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,060
I'm underground market for hacking

32
00:01:58,060 --> 00:02:02,680
and it's been moved on very much from a
cottage industry

33
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:05,790
it's moved into a multi-billion dollar
business

34
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:09,410
in places I'll even in this part of the
world

35
00:02:09,410 --> 00:02:13,090
specialists that attack web sites that
are e-commerce based

36
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:17,319
or in actually go to the russians States
state-based

37
00:02:17,319 --> 00:02:20,370
hacking that focuses on fraud

38
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:24,550
with regards to banks and finance
companies and in other parts the world

39
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:28,040
around intellectual property theft it's
becoming clearer

40
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:31,340
every day that we need to protect our
digital assets

41
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:34,390
in the same way that we would protect a
power systems

42
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:37,750
a water and other pieces if key
infrastructure

43
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:40,819
that we supply to our residents a

44
00:02:40,819 --> 00:02:44,180
all around the world and all uses of the
digital economy

45
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:47,989
as more and more devices connect to the
internet

46
00:02:47,989 --> 00:02:52,360
the attack surface will increase 34
five-fold easily

47
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:56,099
in the next few years working together
at a conference like this

48
00:02:56,099 --> 00:02:59,230
to make sure that where actively
participating

49
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:03,519
where sharing information making sure
you guys understand you know and

50
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:04,200
leverage

51
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:07,709
the more than a billion dollars a year
the Juniper spins on research

52
00:03:07,709 --> 00:03:11,819
and make sure you guys can leverage that
to help better protect your assets

53
00:03:11,819 --> 00:03:15,530
out with that like to a game thank you
everyone for coming

54
00:03:15,530 --> 00:03:19,470
today and and welcome affronted to buy
cat and with that I'll pass it back to

55
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:19,920
Jeff

56
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:26,920
thank you alright everybody

57
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:32,870
this is the best part of the day for me
it's a kicking off the show in

58
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:36,659
introducing the keynote speaker that
we're all looking forward to hear from

59
00:03:36,659 --> 00:03:39,769
I'm gonna say a few words about doctor
Crocker

60
00:03:39,769 --> 00:03:42,750
just to embarrass him a little bit
before he gets up here and lay the

61
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:43,580
groundwork

62
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:49,400
I'm so steve has been lucky enough to
sort of see it all

63
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:52,819
from sort of the dawn of the Internet
Arbor net

64
00:03:52,819 --> 00:03:56,330
I'm to present-day and in the sixties

65
00:03:56,330 --> 00:03:59,799
steve was a graduate student at the UCLA

66
00:03:59,799 --> 00:04:05,409
university-california LA and was part of
the team that developed the

67
00:04:05,409 --> 00:04:09,510
protocols for the ARPANET which
eventually became as we all know it the

68
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:10,189
Internet

69
00:04:10,189 --> 00:04:13,790
I'm so from the very early days he was
intimately involved

70
00:04:13,790 --> 00:04:17,680
the plumbing in the networking the
reason why certain decisions were made

71
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:20,720
certain trade of certain technical
decisions were made that we're all

72
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,199
living west today

73
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:25,699
some noise I always really enjoy talking
with Steve because

74
00:04:25,699 --> 00:04:29,090
all speculate about something out loud I
wonder why

75
00:04:29,090 --> 00:04:33,660
ipv4 on and he'll know the answer take

76
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:36,690
you know that a Adobe a pretty
privileged place to be to be able to

77
00:04:36,690 --> 00:04:38,720
have that level of insight

78
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:43,130
later after UCLA steve was a program
manager at darpa

79
00:04:43,130 --> 00:04:46,500
as senior researcher at USC who's a

80
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:50,520
founder and director at the computer
science laboratory at the Aerospace

81
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:52,520
Corporation

82
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:56,680
he was a BPA trusted information systems
or Tess

83
00:04:56,680 --> 00:05:00,900
how many people in this room remember it
s they created one of the first

84
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:04,199
commercial firewalls about the same time
as checkpoint

85
00:05:04,199 --> 00:05:08,370
so he was at the company that created
the first commercial firewall

86
00:05:08,370 --> 00:05:13,229
I'm this is my best part though in 1994
Steve was a founder and chief technology

87
00:05:13,229 --> 00:05:16,860
every digital cyber cash company called
cyber cash

88
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:19,889
but probably about 15 years too early up

89
00:05:19,889 --> 00:05:23,830
compared to what's going on with
bitcoins vigil currencies today

90
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:27,220
he's currently the CEO of company called
shin coro a

91
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:30,930
research and development company
focusing currently on collaboration

92
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:32,090
software

93
00:05:32,090 --> 00:05:35,669
and he's been heavily involved in the
development of DNS sec

94
00:05:35,669 --> 00:05:39,220
protocols the Internet Society I'm

95
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:43,070
when he was at the up

96
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:47,650
so let me see well so many who'd
probably don't know this is how many

97
00:05:47,650 --> 00:05:49,010
people are familiar with the

98
00:05:49,010 --> 00:05:52,350
RFC system artsy 1234

99
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:56,600
so Steve accidentally created that when
he wrote RFC number one

100
00:05:56,600 --> 00:06:01,190
and which he didn't realize is artsy
number one it was just seemed like the

101
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:02,050
thing to do

102
00:06:02,050 --> 00:06:05,300
and then like anything else on the
Internet it became a custom

103
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:08,930
and so now it's the way things are done
I'm

104
00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:12,770
he was also involved at are poke and

105
00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:16,340
arpa working group which later devolved
into the IETF

106
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:19,430
so steve has been involved in many

107
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:23,150
key areas are the Internet and I always
love his insights

108
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:26,640
and so I'm hoping he can share some with
you as topic today is going to be

109
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:28,500
talking about let's fix this mess

110
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:32,160
and he's going to reserve some time
again for questions and answers so

111
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:35,760
try to think up your best question and
stable does best answer it

112
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:42,760
so it's my pleasure to welcome my friend
Steve thank you thank you

113
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:49,470
now so

114
00:06:49,470 --> 00:06:54,460
his recitation of history no is a plate
including

115
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:57,970
love the history of all the mistakes
don't have to revisit

116
00:06:57,970 --> 00:07:03,140
mom including why the network was built
the way it was and so forth

117
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:06,730
arm it's a pleasure to be here

118
00:07:06,730 --> 00:07:11,590
no as a possibly a surprise at least a
surprise to me

119
00:07:11,590 --> 00:07:16,450
another been to a black hat conference
although been involved in no

120
00:07:16,450 --> 00:07:19,880
network security for a long time um

121
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:24,320
and so I thought this is appreciate the
invitation I'm in town

122
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:29,060
because I'm heavily involved with the
another organization called I can

123
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:32,520
that oversees the domain name system and
the

124
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:36,400
allocation have addresses and and a
unique identifiers

125
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:41,290
home and it's a the small clerical
operation that seems to have

126
00:07:41,290 --> 00:07:44,540
grown and grown and grown and grown

127
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:47,640
and we grown all the time um

128
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:50,860
sorry im full a bad jokes today the

129
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:56,040
a and and although I have primarily a
technical background

130
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:59,600
longevity helps and the you hang around
in

131
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:03,080
and now I'm chairman of the board which
means that I get to do very little

132
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:05,530
technical work unlawful other political
work

133
00:08:05,530 --> 00:08:08,530
'em I have

134
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:12,070
some something approximating

135
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:16,910
some preparation here min

136
00:08:16,910 --> 00:08:23,020
nurse um

137
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:27,380
one thing I'm worried about in no being
invited to a

138
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:30,620
black at meeting was what the dress code
was

139
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:35,440
and though it turns out that I can we
have abortions

140
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:40,000
you don't have any bike at

141
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,849
said to bring my own on

142
00:08:43,849 --> 00:08:47,120
I know there's better on it with if my
head

143
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:52,130
is too shiny tell me in a way to put it
back on um

144
00:08:52,130 --> 00:08:55,300
I'm I'll

145
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:58,600
home the research person by

146
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:03,430
oren tation and by training you know
come back to all that

147
00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:06,800
in how it relates to to hear norm

148
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:11,050
but i wanna mmm take a little tour
through history a little different from

149
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:12,070
the one that term

150
00:09:12,070 --> 00:09:16,300
just talked about its beauty

151
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:21,420
um soap you know that there's a lot of
the platitudes about

152
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:24,450
up the growth up the network um

153
00:09:24,450 --> 00:09:28,060
from the early days I'll show you just a
couple a brief pictures

154
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:32,180
on so let's that's the diagram

155
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:35,589
up the network MENTOR Network home

156
00:09:35,589 --> 00:09:40,850
in December 1969 for nodes in the
western part of the United States three

157
00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:41,900
in California

158
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:45,470
and won it the University of Utah a

159
00:09:45,470 --> 00:09:49,140
and the single computer at each those
sites

160
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:53,920
are connected to a big machine that
about size refrigerator that

161
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:57,460
a you would now call a router in those
days was called an imp

162
00:09:57,460 --> 00:10:00,959
but that's the purpose is served and the
those

163
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:05,220
those lines that connected the round
ones are the routers and the

164
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:09,709
the lines are running at a stupendously
fast

165
00:10:09,709 --> 00:10:13,070
50,000 bits per second 50k

166
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:17,220
I am not 56 even just 50 %uh there's a

167
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:20,930
there's a reason why it 59-56 I'll

168
00:10:20,930 --> 00:10:24,800
and that actually was so

169
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:28,730
dramatic because there'd been a lot of
attempts previously to build networks

170
00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:30,890
that had not worked very well

171
00:10:30,890 --> 00:10:35,170
and their number reasons why this
project succeeded

172
00:10:35,170 --> 00:10:38,350
in the face a previous failures um

173
00:10:38,350 --> 00:10:42,120
in in some ways one other reasons it
succeeded was because

174
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:46,760
there was a lot of diversity diversity
locations diversity machines

175
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:51,570
and arm it sort of forced a separation
issues

176
00:10:51,570 --> 00:10:55,040
so the network grew and and here

177
00:10:55,040 --> 00:11:00,610
it is 'em one year later the since
December 16 ounces December 1970

178
00:11:00,610 --> 00:11:05,250
know they're so lines going across the
country and a dozen nodes

179
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:09,079
and here it is a seven years later
six-and-a-half years later

180
00:11:09,079 --> 00:11:13,970
a and we've had to change the way that
we draw the diagram cuz it can get all

181
00:11:13,970 --> 00:11:15,329
on their very well

182
00:11:15,329 --> 00:11:18,870
um and but you know you know the
dramatic growth somali gonna show you

183
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:22,490
one more of the usual hockey stick it
kinda growth but instead of

184
00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:26,430
numbers and graphs and so forth this one
is arm

185
00:11:26,430 --> 00:11:29,660
account a conceptual where the
breakthroughs were in

186
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:32,980
understanding a tom brokaw

187
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:36,589
in 1988 mentions that on television

188
00:11:36,589 --> 00:11:41,740
so I was a magic moment that all of
sudden the world understands about this

189
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:46,290
prior to that it was login academic and

190
00:11:46,290 --> 00:11:49,740
research networks and students and teach
you about it

191
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:53,390
um and then the World Wide Web and
everybody

192
00:11:53,390 --> 00:11:57,300
and and everybody's mother knows about
this

193
00:11:57,300 --> 00:12:02,700
'em I like that picture because Lloyd
Scott grander smother it reminds me of

194
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:04,120
my mother-in-law

195
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:09,190
on who unknown so a little personal
aside

196
00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:13,760
others those as jobs that I was evolved
from the early days so help

197
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:17,390
arm you formulate some the protocols me
involved in the

198
00:12:17,390 --> 00:12:21,020
in the formation of the ARPANET up

199
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:24,930
and I met my future wife is in the
process

200
00:12:24,930 --> 00:12:29,200
and she came with me well I give a talk
to a university

201
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:34,360
and she went home and tried to explain
all this network stuff this is

202
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:38,709
early part of nineteen seventy-one to
her parents

203
00:12:38,709 --> 00:12:42,280
now she was fortunate to come from a

204
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:45,360
pretty good family her father was a prof

205
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:48,810
relatively famous professor of medicine
and she was a

206
00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:53,030
surrounded by be young doctors who were
pursuing your

207
00:12:53,030 --> 00:12:57,270
and she tried to explain this networking
stuff to her parents

208
00:12:57,270 --> 00:13:01,280
but but is not a doctor not a real
doctor anyway

209
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:04,440
'em and

210
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:07,700
a the conversation go very far

211
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:11,510
some many years later after you're
married a

212
00:13:11,510 --> 00:13:15,650
we needed to move back into her parents
else rather abruptly for some

213
00:13:15,650 --> 00:13:20,930
medical attention and night at that
point was a

214
00:13:20,930 --> 00:13:23,980
running a research laboratory the one
that just mentioned

215
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:28,380
and I'm I'm we moved overnight from Los
Angeles back to Boston

216
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:31,410
up in the and so I have this problem

217
00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:34,760
how do I keep my laboratory going how do
I manage a distance but we've got this

218
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:35,810
network

219
00:13:35,810 --> 00:13:39,900
and does so I called in a couple favors
and I dragged

220
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:43,100
a big ol heavy cloud the terminal into

221
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:47,260
money in Los else and my mother-in-law
stood at the

222
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:51,610
at the door said there's no room for
that in this house

223
00:13:51,610 --> 00:13:55,350
%uh those of state of high tension and I
understood so I

224
00:13:55,350 --> 00:13:59,280
turn tail and dragged it out made some
other arrangement

225
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:04,470
time passed and AUB beings worked out
quite well

226
00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:09,250
up and then much later my mother are
still alive

227
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:13,570
I'll was running a business out of her
house trying to keep her husband busy in

228
00:14:13,570 --> 00:14:14,660
retirement

229
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:18,630
and a wifi router with the laptop so
that she could keep the box and

230
00:14:18,630 --> 00:14:19,440
everything

231
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:23,080
and she took enormous delighted in
stealing the WiFi signals from a

232
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:25,650
neighbor's house

233
00:14:25,650 --> 00:14:29,610
and overtime up my stock has risen with
her

234
00:14:29,610 --> 00:14:33,790
rather rather well and we get along very
very nicely

235
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:38,850
so that's a of bill perky little story
about the impact

236
00:14:38,850 --> 00:14:43,150
that the network is had on all of us
which we've all lived in

237
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:46,310
know you've all grown up unit

238
00:14:46,310 --> 00:14:49,750
from I can see from in from the %eh

239
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:53,970
most to you that dove the probably
wasn't the time when the network was

240
00:14:53,970 --> 00:14:54,380
there

241
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:57,620
just just existed and so we had all the
positives

242
00:14:57,620 --> 00:15:01,089
love email the web Facebook or Skype
Google

243
00:15:01,089 --> 00:15:05,260
so forth and change the world and at the
same time

244
00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:08,410
%uh a handful of negatives have crept in

245
00:15:08,410 --> 00:15:12,260
that sorry in intertwined with all those
from of

246
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:15,529
on spam and fraud a to

247
00:15:15,529 --> 00:15:20,050
much worse things call the espionage and
surveillance issues

248
00:15:20,050 --> 00:15:23,610
and arm at the political level culture
wars

249
00:15:23,610 --> 00:15:27,370
which you to read about and participate
yourself

250
00:15:27,370 --> 00:15:32,170
arm and so we have a much more
complicated world

251
00:15:32,170 --> 00:15:38,730
then No when we first started out

252
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:43,930
the EM I from from my interest in these
things

253
00:15:43,930 --> 00:15:47,600
as I said started on the technical side
and my

254
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:51,570
my background even before getting into
internetworking

255
00:15:51,570 --> 00:15:54,779
was pretty strong on the formal side of
things

256
00:15:54,779 --> 00:15:57,810
math background in lot of

257
00:15:57,810 --> 00:16:00,930
hardcore programming while I was in
college

258
00:16:00,930 --> 00:16:04,110
on and unfocused my

259
00:16:04,110 --> 00:16:08,910
research work on formal methods and how
do you make the system's really tight

260
00:16:08,910 --> 00:16:09,880
how do you make them

261
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:13,080
%uh strong so that they can be broken
into

262
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:17,589
and as has been entirely evident we've
lost that

263
00:16:17,589 --> 00:16:22,240
%uh the systems help %uh gotten bigger
and bigger and bigger

264
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:25,560
and we have not made them stronger

265
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:28,830
I love in the main the some

266
00:16:28,830 --> 00:16:32,160
some advances but I'll love

267
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:35,910
we have just unending serve

268
00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:38,960
holes in them so

269
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:42,790
up I wanna come back to that in a minute
but I also wanna talk

270
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:47,200
about 200 a little bit but the other
parts of the world that I'm involved in

271
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:48,210
a mentioned

272
00:16:48,210 --> 00:16:53,460
that I'm at and I can I can is a
non-profit no

273
00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:58,610
organization that tries to do a a
minimal and sorta white

274
00:16:58,610 --> 00:17:03,890
handjob pov orchestrating and an
overseeing the domain name system

275
00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:07,770
primarily along with the addresses and
the

276
00:17:07,770 --> 00:17:10,870
protocol parameters for the idea from so
worth

277
00:17:10,870 --> 00:17:13,939
and it to you is a victim of the

278
00:17:13,939 --> 00:17:17,709
growth and scaling and love complexities
that be set

279
00:17:17,709 --> 00:17:21,070
up to us as we as we

280
00:17:21,070 --> 00:17:24,220
bring the system further along the

281
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:27,620
because because it's time for me to kill
mmm

282
00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:32,169
there's a way to do this right something
when I'll just do them

283
00:17:32,169 --> 00:17:35,820
right army the

284
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:40,540
love in overseeing the domain name
system for example

285
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:45,720
um 10 the small challengers was will
wire there are only a handful of top

286
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:48,100
level domains ComNet board

287
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:51,640
and so for the long with the in the to
other country codes

288
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:54,750
and a lot of pressure right from the
beginning

289
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:58,429
%uh expanding them so after a number of
our

290
00:17:58,429 --> 00:18:03,429
preliminary temps in experiments we my
finally converged on

291
00:18:03,429 --> 00:18:07,850
the a planned with enormous many
community imports and

292
00:18:07,850 --> 00:18:12,260
meetings all over the world over many
years on opening up the domain name

293
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:13,060
system

294
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:18,890
at the top level answered send in your
applications anybody can now apply for

295
00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:22,780
we just want to cover the cost up for
processing the applications and so we

296
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:23,649
set the

297
00:18:23,649 --> 00:18:28,050
the price at a very nominal 185 thousand
dollars per application

298
00:18:28,050 --> 00:18:31,370
arm why so much people last

299
00:18:31,370 --> 00:18:35,640
about a third of that is set aside for

300
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:40,659
arm what we call risk that is in case we
get sued we want to work just that we

301
00:18:40,659 --> 00:18:41,399
could

302
00:18:41,399 --> 00:18:44,460
do it that such as give you some idea of
the mass

303
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:47,899
arm and so we help love

304
00:18:47,899 --> 00:18:54,899
applications for berries brand names web
applications for various social causes

305
00:18:55,090 --> 00:18:58,890
and our a and competition for the
strings we had

306
00:18:58,890 --> 00:19:01,990
1930 applications

307
00:19:01,990 --> 00:19:05,590
do the math and you get around a third
of a billion dollars

308
00:19:05,590 --> 00:19:08,630
in application fees home

309
00:19:08,630 --> 00:19:13,870
and so all of a sudden we gotta a big
bank account and above those 1930

310
00:19:13,870 --> 00:19:18,480
there were a little over 1400 distinct
strings so there was a lot of overlap

311
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:19,419
love

312
00:19:19,419 --> 00:19:23,120
applications to double triple and some
cases more

313
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:26,810
applications for the same string and
that leads to

314
00:19:26,810 --> 00:19:29,890
animal so the questions behind you sort
all that out

315
00:19:29,890 --> 00:19:33,669
and mostly we hope that they sorted out
amongst themselves

316
00:19:33,669 --> 00:19:37,880
in inferred I'll reluctantly will hold
an auction

317
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:40,290
and then the question is will you do
with all that money you get from the

318
00:19:40,290 --> 00:19:41,280
auction

319
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:45,080
sources I see the money all all start
figuring that out I guess

320
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:49,560
arm and then there's olov

321
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:53,310
political pressures how do we make our
decisions for who what r

322
00:19:53,310 --> 00:19:58,080
oversight process and our if you really
want a distraction from the good work

323
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:59,270
that you're doing

324
00:19:59,270 --> 00:20:02,790
on a command you to look at the I can
website and the

325
00:20:02,790 --> 00:20:08,480
enormous amount of worthiness the cause
around all them

326
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:12,230
up coming back

327
00:20:12,230 --> 00:20:16,590
to home the security aspects

328
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:21,310
home we care a lot about security and I
care a lot about security

329
00:20:21,310 --> 00:20:24,750
%uh most of what we've done and
certainly most to what I've done in my

330
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:25,690
life

331
00:20:25,690 --> 00:20:28,810
is focus on how to build systems that
are

332
00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:33,380
are stronger as opposed to finding holes
and systems

333
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:37,720
are ano supposed to tracking down the
bad guys

334
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:42,690
both of those tracking on the bad guys
and finding holes and systems are worthy

335
00:20:42,690 --> 00:20:46,990
are activities and one of the reasons
why I wanted to come here

336
00:20:46,990 --> 00:20:51,190
is because I'd decided that it was time
to get more in touch with what's

337
00:20:51,190 --> 00:20:52,520
actually happening

338
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:56,560
in the world instead of the somewhat
theoretical exercise

339
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:59,690
how do you make things stronger and keep
hoping

340
00:20:59,690 --> 00:21:03,760
that you can do that arm

341
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:07,970
jeff mentioned that I was at trusted
information systems and

342
00:21:07,970 --> 00:21:11,500
we were in the we're fortunate enough to
be

343
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:16,080
a either first or the first to develop
the idea of a firewall

344
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:19,750
and we sold quite a few of them and on
the strength that the company went

345
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:21,919
public in a bunch of mates money

346
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:25,800
but checkpoint beat us by quite a bit in
the marketplace

347
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:30,290
they were may be slightly behind us but
roughly the same era

348
00:21:30,290 --> 00:21:33,480
and 10 the lessons that I'll became

349
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:37,880
very quickly clear is they had a much
more usable product who say

350
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:42,810
easy to configure easy do to read and oh
so we would grow since idea but they are

351
00:21:42,810 --> 00:21:44,030
there no strong

352
00:21:44,030 --> 00:21:47,230
little have a stronger protection

353
00:21:47,230 --> 00:21:51,710
and though but the marketplace was on
the market spoke very clearly

354
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:55,870
am usability a and time to market

355
00:21:55,870 --> 00:21:59,750
beat out security every time sadly

356
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:03,399
firming up to sell it so overtime

357
00:22:03,399 --> 00:22:07,830
we have on things that to my eye

358
00:22:07,830 --> 00:22:13,320
seem to be patches seem to be band-aids
on the system

359
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:16,500
from reporting systems like search

360
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:20,409
to firewalls and intrusion detection
systems

361
00:22:20,409 --> 00:22:24,649
and even to the growth love the entire
industry

362
00:22:24,649 --> 00:22:28,120
that you are all part of on it's a

363
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:31,340
it's a signal are how bad the problem is

364
00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:36,260
in a way it is full employment for you
full employment for me for that matter

365
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:39,980
arm and it's where they work but from a

366
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:43,179
longer-term perspective its

367
00:22:43,179 --> 00:22:50,179
arm my wonder we're not we can do better

368
00:22:50,850 --> 00:22:54,580
so the thing that I wanna say is

369
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:58,710
you guys no what the problems are

370
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:02,600
not at your business that which involved
in are that's what you learn all about

371
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:03,470
them

372
00:23:03,470 --> 00:23:07,889
are and that's extremely important

373
00:23:07,889 --> 00:23:11,690
you obviously have to attend to each
other problems that you find work for

374
00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:13,850
the organization's is your part of

375
00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:17,629
but I want to challenge you to a
additional

376
00:23:17,629 --> 00:23:22,419
goal which is to put yourself out a
business

377
00:23:22,419 --> 00:23:25,440
find out how to express what you know
about

378
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:30,100
the problems with the system and how
they could be built in a way

379
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:35,310
that makes it unnecessary for us to be
here

380
00:23:35,310 --> 00:23:39,520
big challenge mom

381
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:44,379
maybe you think that there's no way to
fix anything that the systems are gonna

382
00:23:44,379 --> 00:23:45,790
keep coming out with her

383
00:23:45,790 --> 00:23:49,679
as many holes as the help from the
vendors they're going to be

384
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:52,710
configured and operated in ways that

385
00:23:52,710 --> 00:23:56,000
love are are you home clueless

386
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:00,260
or brain-dead I would argue that systems
that are hard of

387
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:05,179
to use a hard to configure are probably
built in a way that don't match the

388
00:24:05,179 --> 00:24:06,490
natural capabilities

389
00:24:06,490 --> 00:24:10,350
a human to human factors question and so

390
00:24:10,350 --> 00:24:15,169
%uh the the nontrivial challenger this
is not I'm not being casual about this

391
00:24:15,169 --> 00:24:16,800
and I know that it's very hard

392
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:20,609
I know it's hard because I've tried to
do some things about an

393
00:24:20,609 --> 00:24:23,919
and not gone very far but I still think

394
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:28,040
that collectively if we build

395
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:31,179
a expectation we build an image love

396
00:24:31,179 --> 00:24:34,690
all what it would take to have systems

397
00:24:34,690 --> 00:24:38,310
not only the individual parts later
delivered from vendors for talking about

398
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:39,500
operating systems or

399
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:42,700
mobile devices or or networks arm

400
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:46,280
but also the use of these systems only
in the measure the system's

401
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:49,750
in such a way that the reliability is
stronger

402
00:24:49,750 --> 00:24:53,040
in such a way that the new standard
method to views

403
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:58,060
don't lead to on newspaper headlines
about

404
00:24:58,060 --> 00:25:01,240
massive disclosures data on

405
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:04,760
think about a world like that and

406
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:08,090
think about what changes should take
place

407
00:25:08,090 --> 00:25:11,260
all along the way from this offer
development process the design process

408
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:13,859
to the user expectations

409
00:25:13,859 --> 00:25:18,440
on automobiles for example phone wants
to compare

410
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:21,679
have come a very long way I remember

411
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:27,369
when I first learned to drive in the
early nineteen sixties

412
00:25:27,369 --> 00:25:30,760
cars where semi reliable

413
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:34,350
more so the time I could depend on when
I put the key in the ignition

414
00:25:34,350 --> 00:25:38,659
we used to put keys in the ignition
actually arm and in turn the key the the

415
00:25:38,659 --> 00:25:39,780
car will go on

416
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:44,700
but um if the car was hit a little bit
for mileage on it and was a little there

417
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:45,790
might be some questions on

418
00:25:45,790 --> 00:25:49,369
today cars are extremely reliable I mean
I'm

419
00:25:49,369 --> 00:25:52,909
I'm rarely her in a been in that
situation where after

420
00:25:52,909 --> 00:25:56,030
to think about well what happens if the
car doesn't start

421
00:25:56,030 --> 00:26:00,149
if I screw up and look battery run down
and so forth but mostly

422
00:26:00,149 --> 00:26:04,290
it is a rock-solid part of the

423
00:26:04,290 --> 00:26:08,700
the world that I live in on computers

424
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:12,879
the hardware it's got more more reliable
on I remember when

425
00:26:12,879 --> 00:26:19,369
are we were reporting that the UNIX
system it stayed up for 24 hours

426
00:26:19,369 --> 00:26:23,369
that was a big deal concerned you'd
before that we would expect that

427
00:26:23,369 --> 00:26:27,590
every several hours would have to
restart the the computer chose the

428
00:26:27,590 --> 00:26:32,129
operating system is broken or the
hardware broken we're past that point

429
00:26:32,129 --> 00:26:38,070
but we're still a long way from our
feeling comfortable what systems

430
00:26:38,070 --> 00:26:42,470
on in and large part it's because up the
enormous complexity

431
00:26:42,470 --> 00:26:45,790
the complexity is driven by the scale

432
00:26:45,790 --> 00:26:49,669
growth and the demand for new
applications that demand for

433
00:26:49,669 --> 00:26:53,690
a novel uses and for are a while a wider
set up the

434
00:26:53,690 --> 00:26:58,970
a user's we can't demand that every user
go through a security training course

435
00:26:58,970 --> 00:27:02,300
and it probably wouldn't help even if we
did so

436
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:05,550
it to be very challenging our problem

437
00:27:05,550 --> 00:27:09,149
but its as I say one that I think
deserves

438
00:27:09,149 --> 00:27:12,300
attention and you all are in

439
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:15,649
a very privileged position for at least

440
00:27:15,649 --> 00:27:19,510
two reasons one is the you are on the
ground

441
00:27:19,510 --> 00:27:22,669
in the trenches dealing with the real
data you know

442
00:27:22,669 --> 00:27:26,730
where the holes are you know not only
were the whole is in a particular system

443
00:27:26,730 --> 00:27:30,000
but with a bit of reflection you know

444
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,310
on how those problems were

445
00:27:33,310 --> 00:27:36,919
created in the first place what the
syndromes are what the patterns are

446
00:27:36,919 --> 00:27:40,500
and how to on think about it

447
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:44,230
and the other is I'll something that you
have

448
00:27:44,230 --> 00:27:47,820
that I don't have it all you have a lot
more time here

449
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:51,590
your you're going to watch the next

450
00:27:51,590 --> 00:27:55,450
many years OVR systems evolve unfold

451
00:27:55,450 --> 00:27:59,350
and there'll be up quite a few
opportunities

452
00:27:59,350 --> 00:28:02,850
at various times for you to speak up

453
00:28:02,850 --> 00:28:06,340
and to perhaps be in charge and

454
00:28:06,340 --> 00:28:10,109
change the way the streams are flowing
or

455
00:28:10,109 --> 00:28:13,109
been the twiggs in a different direction

456
00:28:13,109 --> 00:28:16,340
arm I'm a lot more comfortable

457
00:28:16,340 --> 00:28:20,280
taking questions that I am talking so I
think I'm just going to switch to that

458
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:21,350
mode

459
00:28:21,350 --> 00:28:24,889
on where or how we doing on time

460
00:28:24,889 --> 00:28:31,889
don't 10 minutes

461
00:28:46,169 --> 00:28:49,039
hi are you mention about I can you
mentioned it's

462
00:28:49,039 --> 00:28:52,970
of course it's big money by peace
because just a little

463
00:28:52,970 --> 00:28:57,139
speaking but I can you mentioned above
course them directing the question

464
00:28:57,139 --> 00:29:00,250
a maybe not to you

465
00:29:00,250 --> 00:29:03,919
politically budget said that in a
knowledge in the light of what mister

466
00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:07,960
Edward snowed in respectfully as for the
world and

467
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:12,610
now the new city is hitting us that I
can is kinda be scintillating itself

468
00:29:12,610 --> 00:29:13,600
then setting up a

469
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:17,019
international body how does that mean
use relate to itself

470
00:29:17,019 --> 00:29:21,649
is the America finally woken up and said
okay you know what let's get rid of

471
00:29:21,649 --> 00:29:26,220
the the Big Brother kind of an approach
what is they don't

472
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:31,049
another political will to be a nerd so
so I I truly apologize but

473
00:29:31,049 --> 00:29:34,580
a didn't quite understand the question
good

474
00:29:34,580 --> 00:29:38,210
you can use it again or on Sep sorry
about that

475
00:29:38,210 --> 00:29:42,230
my question is it on the recent news
that I can is known

476
00:29:42,230 --> 00:29:46,460
not going to be busy and America are
it's going to be an international body

477
00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:49,529
i sat at Muse worse is what a good
snowed in said

478
00:29:49,529 --> 00:29:53,389
worse is what Barrack Obama is trying to
say about

479
00:29:53,389 --> 00:29:56,850
you know not being the big brother
anymore yeah

480
00:29:56,850 --> 00:29:59,889
um so

481
00:29:59,889 --> 00:30:03,649
let me say but more about the the
situation I can isn't

482
00:30:03,649 --> 00:30:06,990
arm I can news

483
00:30:06,990 --> 00:30:11,330
quite quite global in its scope in dance

484
00:30:11,330 --> 00:30:15,590
structure arm the parts that

485
00:30:15,590 --> 00:30:20,120
on some people find problematic or

486
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:23,889
irritating is that we're on

487
00:30:23,889 --> 00:30:27,350
a private company as a legal matter

488
00:30:27,350 --> 00:30:31,120
are incorporated in City Calif in the
United States

489
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:34,820
um so that's the

490
00:30:34,820 --> 00:30:40,149
the US side of the story we have a
border for directors that is

491
00:30:40,149 --> 00:30:46,049
are by our own bylaws are composed of
people from all parts of the world

492
00:30:46,049 --> 00:30:50,129
we have a formal requirement to have
directors

493
00:30:50,129 --> 00:30:54,799
from each of what we call five regions
course by roughly 25 comments

494
00:30:54,799 --> 00:30:58,470
on with some embarrassment we treat

495
00:30:58,470 --> 00:31:03,590
Australia an olive Asia in all the
Pacific Islands as one region

496
00:31:03,590 --> 00:31:07,000
arm and though we could probably use

497
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:10,090
little more representation from this
region but

498
00:31:10,090 --> 00:31:14,159
but we have people from all over the
world at every level the organization

499
00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:15,049
not just the

500
00:31:15,049 --> 00:31:19,980
arm not just the board arm the

501
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:24,419
there are two big things that are
underway

502
00:31:24,419 --> 00:31:27,700
and they're intertwined but there are
somewhat separate

503
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:32,539
the clerical function that we call the
eye and a function

504
00:31:32,539 --> 00:31:36,289
that is the management at the root zone
and the

505
00:31:36,289 --> 00:31:39,529
related protocol parameters and
addresses

506
00:31:39,529 --> 00:31:42,909
are has been operated under a a

507
00:31:42,909 --> 00:31:48,100
a special contract with the United
States Department of Commerce

508
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:52,379
on no money changes hands a 20 dollar
contract

509
00:31:52,379 --> 00:31:56,500
and it has been the framework for

510
00:31:56,500 --> 00:32:01,460
arm oversight ove the function that
would perform but it's very lightweight

511
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:02,129
oversight

512
00:32:02,129 --> 00:32:05,500
so win a top-level domain operator for
example

513
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:09,230
say somebody running arm love

514
00:32:09,230 --> 00:32:13,529
a .am why from Malaysia wants to change

515
00:32:13,529 --> 00:32:18,200
the address or any other a new name
server to the list of name servers

516
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:21,940
that are supporting them they'll send us

517
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:26,610
a message saying please make this change
in the roots on so everybody knows

518
00:32:26,610 --> 00:32:30,129
who are root servers are men who are
nameservers are %uh

519
00:32:30,129 --> 00:32:33,799
we take a look at that make sure we
understand that and

520
00:32:33,799 --> 00:32:37,399
in cooperation with Verisign Louis
update the

521
00:32:37,399 --> 00:32:40,679
a master root files own and twice a day

522
00:32:40,679 --> 00:32:45,490
our copy of the total would file is sent
out to all the root servers

523
00:32:45,490 --> 00:32:50,330
around the world there's Aug 13 Sep
separate servers 13 operations

524
00:32:50,330 --> 00:32:53,700
each one of which how's are some number
of our

525
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:57,860
separate name servers around the world
to an aggregate several hundred name

526
00:32:57,860 --> 00:32:58,429
servers

527
00:32:58,429 --> 00:33:01,619
arm and that process is

528
00:33:01,619 --> 00:33:05,179
overseen but overseen and a very light
way way by

529
00:33:05,179 --> 00:33:09,260
%uh the former commerce week and a half
ago

530
00:33:09,260 --> 00:33:13,119
almost two weeks ago are the former
commerce announced

531
00:33:13,119 --> 00:33:17,000
that in accordance with the original
plans with formation if I can

532
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:21,019
are they are finally who was it to spend
the do sooner

533
00:33:21,019 --> 00:33:24,260
they are finely exiting from that
process

534
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:27,659
up but not abruptly they've announced
that they will exit

535
00:33:27,659 --> 00:33:32,690
and they have invited our consultation
with the entire world wide community

536
00:33:32,690 --> 00:33:36,700
on how to do this and whether or not
there is a need to replace

537
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:39,970
not the function that we're doing but
the stewardship

538
00:33:39,970 --> 00:33:43,200
part about the oversight process so that
one element

539
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:46,809
of globalization and the other element

540
00:33:46,809 --> 00:33:50,200
up globalization is that we have been

541
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:55,539
for quite a while looking at the way i
can. itself as an organization

542
00:33:55,539 --> 00:33:58,609
is structured and help from

543
00:33:58,609 --> 00:34:02,179
taken some steps to reduce

544
00:34:02,179 --> 00:34:05,429
the on a the emphasis

545
00:34:05,429 --> 00:34:08,450
that comes from our origins in the US

546
00:34:08,450 --> 00:34:14,369
and a I'm becomes or more equally
balanced around the world

547
00:34:14,369 --> 00:34:18,799
so one big step is that the headquarters
which has been in Los Angeles

548
00:34:18,799 --> 00:34:22,639
basically took a hammer and smashed in
summer breaking it up into three

549
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:26,179
and we're putting on we call it now try
quarters

550
00:34:26,179 --> 00:34:30,200
and we put one piece living on par de
los angeles when we created to other

551
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:30,879
parts

552
00:34:30,879 --> 00:34:35,339
one in Istanbul Turkey and the other in
fact in Singapore

553
00:34:35,339 --> 00:34:38,960
the fact that we're having a meeting
down the street sir kinda just

554
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:40,220
coincidence but

555
00:34:40,220 --> 00:34:43,329
we have spun up the headquarters or try
quarters

556
00:34:43,329 --> 00:34:47,730
in Singapore now have substantial number
people and I'll

557
00:34:47,730 --> 00:34:51,730
overtime we'll have not just arm

558
00:34:51,730 --> 00:34:56,440
people look like a branch office but but
part of the top levels were people that

559
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:57,020
are

560
00:34:57,020 --> 00:35:02,020
reporting to the CEO distributed in
doing functions that are unique so won't

561
00:35:02,020 --> 00:35:02,720
be

562
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:06,140
I'll second-order in fact are are

563
00:35:06,140 --> 00:35:11,150
CEO and President funny shoddy as
committed to actually moving himself

564
00:35:11,150 --> 00:35:14,299
are to live in these different places
and I'll

565
00:35:14,299 --> 00:35:19,460
thus this week actually units wife moved
into Singapore and will be here for

566
00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:24,020
a few months have been Istanbul for
several months later this year

567
00:35:24,020 --> 00:35:27,250
up so those are the two distinct
elements of

568
00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:30,460
globalization all I can then underway

569
00:35:30,460 --> 00:35:33,740
there is a another effort which is very
important

570
00:35:33,740 --> 00:35:37,490
in a somewhat distinct there's a much
broader discussion

571
00:35:37,490 --> 00:35:42,180
about Internet Governance are and the
small job that

572
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:45,369
I can does in this area is so

573
00:35:45,369 --> 00:35:51,010
a dwarfed by all the other big issues in
their governance what do you do with

574
00:35:51,010 --> 00:35:56,010
all the the fraud in law enforcement
issues what he do what

575
00:35:56,010 --> 00:35:59,869
the culture wars what do you do about
berries commerce issues

576
00:35:59,869 --> 00:36:03,589
arm and part up that activity

577
00:36:03,589 --> 00:36:07,710
is will show up next month in a major
meeting in Brazil

578
00:36:07,710 --> 00:36:10,760
are which were heavily involved in but
it's not our meeting

579
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:14,140
so there's like a three-ring circus
underway

580
00:36:14,140 --> 00:36:18,030
and it's a little hard to keep track of
all that a no no I hope that answers

581
00:36:18,030 --> 00:36:18,930
your question

582
00:36:18,930 --> 00:36:25,930
up somewhere along the way there and
this helpful on more broadly

583
00:36:35,670 --> 00:36:36,420
thanks

584
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:39,390
I'm so I guess my question celebre to
faults on

585
00:36:39,390 --> 00:36:44,060
first do think that the like your
challenge that you gave to

586
00:36:44,060 --> 00:36:48,410
Sol you know but get make better problem
build processes or or development

587
00:36:48,410 --> 00:36:49,270
process to it

588
00:36:49,270 --> 00:36:52,920
both essentially enough from the ground
up like more secure systems and so on

589
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:56,910
don't you think this is some I had the
feeling over my brief history

590
00:36:56,910 --> 00:37:00,930
you know brief research that this is
someone actually done and and and and in

591
00:37:00,930 --> 00:37:02,750
lots of different ways already

592
00:37:02,750 --> 00:37:05,710
you know there have been solutions to a
lot of the problems that we face and

593
00:37:05,710 --> 00:37:08,870
lots of systems have been more secure
and protocols have been more secure

594
00:37:08,870 --> 00:37:12,090
and just in the end the adoption failed
and you know

595
00:37:12,090 --> 00:37:15,730
just the half the world just didn't
change in that way I mean

596
00:37:15,730 --> 00:37:18,850
i've seen. research come out and
operating systems that are awesomely

597
00:37:18,850 --> 00:37:21,030
secure you know protocols that are much
better

598
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:24,380
and still you know it's just not widely
deployed and used

599
00:37:24,380 --> 00:37:28,730
right and arm so this gets back to this
usability

600
00:37:28,730 --> 00:37:32,230
verses a security arm

601
00:37:32,230 --> 00:37:36,530
yes it's possible to build an many
people are built much more secure

602
00:37:36,530 --> 00:37:38,600
systems and as you've observed

603
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:41,759
are the history is littered with

604
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:45,590
are unsuccessful attempts to get them
adopted arm

605
00:37:45,590 --> 00:37:49,200
and I certainly help for my almost two
failures

606
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:52,320
in that regard up to me

607
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:57,110
the that turns back into a challenge
that we need to think harder about it

608
00:37:57,110 --> 00:38:01,480
now it is an inescapable requirement

609
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:05,270
that whatever we build people going to
have to want to use

610
00:38:05,270 --> 00:38:08,570
when I can be will force it on them so

611
00:38:08,570 --> 00:38:12,190
if we're going to are you get systems
that

612
00:38:12,190 --> 00:38:17,200
are more secure we're going to have to
not fall into the trap of will do you

613
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:19,560
want to be usable or do you want to be
secure

614
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:24,710
in the answer has to be yes be all that
and until we figure out how to solve

615
00:38:24,710 --> 00:38:25,200
that problem

616
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:28,570
and that I think is not just

617
00:38:28,570 --> 00:38:32,140
are a puzzle or you know something the
so all that's too bad

618
00:38:32,140 --> 00:38:36,710
I i think there is some technical depth
to that number understanding how to

619
00:38:36,710 --> 00:38:38,050
blend those things the other

620
00:38:38,050 --> 00:38:42,380
and not have it be a trade up your train
of appeared zero-sum game

621
00:38:42,380 --> 00:38:45,570
never get and like that answer so the
second part then s

622
00:38:45,570 --> 00:38:48,790
and even if we would have Noah a

623
00:38:48,790 --> 00:38:53,740
much more secure system and its usable
and everything what about the inherent

624
00:38:53,740 --> 00:38:56,720
problem of putting yourself out of
business you know that you know most

625
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:59,930
companies are people probably don't want
to do that like even if they could or

626
00:38:59,930 --> 00:39:01,540
even if they had a chance so

627
00:39:01,540 --> 00:39:06,390
as an example on just as really a at
this is a minor calf example but

628
00:39:06,390 --> 00:39:11,800
recently i've seen devices set-top boxes
for TVs are different devices being put

629
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:12,170
out

630
00:39:12,170 --> 00:39:16,830
that looked like I mean ever in lots of
different ways in securing bondable

631
00:39:16,830 --> 00:39:19,850
but it didn't look like that was a
mistake it looked like and in a lot of

632
00:39:19,850 --> 00:39:22,620
cases that was on purpose and actually
not even on purpose

633
00:39:22,620 --> 00:39:27,000
to you know be hackable or something by
remote guys and be

634
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:30,330
you no use for militia stuff but
actually being used for

635
00:39:30,330 --> 00:39:34,470
in a bit coming wider deployed because
the community can use

636
00:39:34,470 --> 00:39:38,320
open devices may be much more or like
you know hackable and and

637
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:41,960
in secure devices may be much more than
they can do with secure devices

638
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:46,490
I mean think about for example consoles
versus set-top boxes on your TV

639
00:39:46,490 --> 00:39:49,530
and you can always repurpose your out
your site set-top box

640
00:39:49,530 --> 00:39:53,600
you it's very hard to repurpose a consul
get a gaming console right because the

641
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:54,180
security

642
00:39:54,180 --> 00:39:57,180
right so arm

643
00:39:57,180 --> 00:40:01,200
I think there's on maybe two different
things

644
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:05,120
involved in what you've said on the
first thing

645
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:09,010
was so is it problematic

646
00:40:09,010 --> 00:40:12,410
to produce things that will put yourself
on a business on

647
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:16,470
that so that's the kind of a standard
problem big companies

648
00:40:16,470 --> 00:40:19,700
often have are reticent to

649
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:23,280
arm bring up products that would
obsolete the products that they help

650
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:26,400
the problem is and and many companies
know this and have

651
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:29,700
dole with a very forcefully if you don't
somebody else will

652
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:33,560
so you have to be in creative
destruction all the time

653
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:37,480
are and the slow literature on this I
haven't invented the sand

654
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:41,760
and you can read about the other arm
element that you've talked about

655
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:45,290
is on in you didn't say this exactly so

656
00:40:45,290 --> 00:40:48,310
apologize if I'm putting words in your
mouth but a

657
00:40:48,310 --> 00:40:51,590
you brought into juxtaposition the

658
00:40:51,590 --> 00:40:55,700
be tension between security and openness

659
00:40:55,700 --> 00:40:59,160
and I don't think that there's a
fundamental

660
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:02,810
are contradiction there I think that you
can have

661
00:41:02,810 --> 00:41:06,340
platforms that are extendable that
people who have open interfaces that

662
00:41:06,340 --> 00:41:07,620
people can build on

663
00:41:07,620 --> 00:41:12,580
and still have separation and control
access and

664
00:41:12,580 --> 00:41:15,710
limitations the are built in underneath
out

665
00:41:15,710 --> 00:41:18,920
in some sense the fundamental role in
operating system

666
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:22,320
arm and our it's not a trivial question

667
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:25,660
the army I would build operating system
for many many years

668
00:41:25,660 --> 00:41:29,810
and getting it right probable right
level of functionality in the right

669
00:41:29,810 --> 00:41:30,760
degree

670
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:34,890
of separation is just as challenging
which is why the whole business

671
00:41:34,890 --> 00:41:36,570
operating systems is not yet

672
00:41:36,570 --> 00:41:39,720
closed on clothes subject but

673
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:43,590
are but I think that you can actually
have it both ways you can help

674
00:41:43,590 --> 00:41:47,810
the openness that provides the platform
for people to build on

675
00:41:47,810 --> 00:41:51,200
that is the core principle that we used
in the design of the

676
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:54,490
protocols for the network are and at the
same time

677
00:41:54,490 --> 00:41:57,880
I think you can help clarity and
cleanliness and

678
00:41:57,880 --> 00:42:01,820
precision about the functionality

679
00:42:01,820 --> 00:42:06,430
and build things underneath the that
provide the necessary levels of

680
00:42:06,430 --> 00:42:10,220
protection of the core infrastructure
and protection at the user's

681
00:42:10,220 --> 00:42:17,220
or using an infrastructure thank you
very much

682
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:28,770
are warning sticker arm I'm curious to
know

683
00:42:28,770 --> 00:42:33,620
the real reason behind I can setting the
price of high for a

684
00:42:33,620 --> 00:42:38,120
domain name up occasions and secondly
are like to understand what factors

685
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:41,970
come into picture are in the process
these applications

686
00:42:41,970 --> 00:42:46,390
a II club party this you wanna know the
real reason for

687
00:42:46,390 --> 00:42:50,230
for what for you said one-third of it
goes to

688
00:42:50,230 --> 00:42:53,760
goes to help you if somebody sues over

689
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:57,150
I mean I was joking I want to know the
real reason a

690
00:42:57,150 --> 00:43:00,750
lie I can set the price of all other
prices so high

691
00:43:00,750 --> 00:43:04,470
yeah on leon

692
00:43:04,470 --> 00:43:08,190
right that's a that's a that's a fair
question

693
00:43:08,190 --> 00:43:11,380
and just to bring it into

694
00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:15,730
mmm sharp a focus for everybody at the
next level down

695
00:43:15,730 --> 00:43:19,420
one can buy a registration for domain
name

696
00:43:19,420 --> 00:43:22,890
in car more well now to order something
for

697
00:43:22,890 --> 00:43:26,870
or the price is exactly these days but
call it on the order of ten dollars a

698
00:43:26,870 --> 00:43:27,310
year

699
00:43:27,310 --> 00:43:31,210
and ten dollars 295,000 I was a big jump

700
00:43:31,210 --> 00:43:34,400
arm the

701
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:37,580
on I said we spent many years

702
00:43:37,580 --> 00:43:42,260
literally years and years are working
over what the rule should be

703
00:43:42,260 --> 00:43:45,260
but the process should be in one of the
things that emerged from those

704
00:43:45,260 --> 00:43:46,500
consultations

705
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:49,700
was a Inc a very heavy concerned

706
00:43:49,700 --> 00:43:52,850
in fact about security and number
different ways

707
00:43:52,850 --> 00:43:56,510
are what are the qualifications for
running

708
00:43:56,510 --> 00:44:00,740
a new top-level domain to love the
things that we worried about is so

709
00:44:00,740 --> 00:44:04,440
on I'll through things to write about

710
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:07,610
financial liability arm

711
00:44:07,610 --> 00:44:10,730
technical competence and arm

712
00:44:10,730 --> 00:44:14,190
I'll just call the honesty on

713
00:44:14,190 --> 00:44:17,300
quite a few are part to the community

714
00:44:17,300 --> 00:44:20,580
law enforcement and government and so
forth are

715
00:44:20,580 --> 00:44:24,570
express very strong concern what would
happen if the new top-level domain were

716
00:44:24,570 --> 00:44:25,090
set up

717
00:44:25,090 --> 00:44:30,110
and criminals were running at and taking
advantage of the fact that they

718
00:44:30,110 --> 00:44:34,900
had control over a top level domain to
to do a bunch of things that would be

719
00:44:34,900 --> 00:44:38,670
on socially undesirable say so

720
00:44:38,670 --> 00:44:41,880
on the application process

721
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:45,250
is a very heavy weight process with a
lot up different

722
00:44:45,250 --> 00:44:48,720
aspects to it examination of the
applicant

723
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:53,430
are examination at the apt and systems
and so forth and then of course we have

724
00:44:53,430 --> 00:44:57,140
the the problem dealing with contention
are

725
00:44:57,140 --> 00:45:00,800
and objections from community is
sometimes it isn't just a question of

726
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:04,690
two different parties want the same
domain name are but we have plenty of

727
00:45:04,690 --> 00:45:05,050
his

728
00:45:05,050 --> 00:45:09,170
instances where somebody also we want
this domain name

729
00:45:09,170 --> 00:45:12,720
and somebody else will say you nobody
should have that domain name or they

730
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:16,350
shouldn't have it are so we have
community objections we help our

731
00:45:16,350 --> 00:45:17,640
geographic names

732
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:21,050
are one of the more visible and famous
ones which I want

733
00:45:21,050 --> 00:45:24,770
say anything about the outcome but just
to sketch the issue

734
00:45:24,770 --> 00:45:28,350
there's a as a small company and no

735
00:45:28,350 --> 00:45:31,420
northwest part of United States called
Amazon

736
00:45:31,420 --> 00:45:35,520
to souls books or something like that
and

737
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:40,210
on the and they apply for Don Amazon

738
00:45:40,210 --> 00:45:44,650
and our we have our messages coming in
from

739
00:45:44,650 --> 00:45:49,410
another part of the world from South
America on multiple countries saying

740
00:45:49,410 --> 00:45:53,630
you know of we like the emails on two in
fact we have our river

741
00:45:53,630 --> 00:45:58,280
and our with with we think this kind of
important to us and we're not sure

742
00:45:58,280 --> 00:46:02,190
that day are a commercial company in
North America should be the right one

743
00:46:02,190 --> 00:46:02,670
for

744
00:46:02,670 --> 00:46:05,930
and just to give you an idea of how

745
00:46:05,930 --> 00:46:10,150
interesting this gets got a message from
our somebody in Greece's said

746
00:46:10,150 --> 00:46:13,710
you know Amazon really is a Greek word

747
00:46:13,710 --> 00:46:18,260
and of where the ones that created the
stories around a one-out

748
00:46:18,260 --> 00:46:21,490
and so then you you try to sort out
what's the right answer

749
00:46:21,490 --> 00:46:25,350
there and I as I say I won't say
anything about the alchemist but

750
00:46:25,350 --> 00:46:29,990
on it's expensive arm just go back to
your question about where the money goes

751
00:46:29,990 --> 00:46:34,230
it's actually expensive to sort all that
out and to do it in a way that is

752
00:46:34,230 --> 00:46:39,970
are as documented in its transparent
anna's

753
00:46:39,970 --> 00:46:43,040
are conformant to reasonable set rules

754
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:46,560
as we know how to make it doesn't leave
everybody happy but at least

755
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:50,060
a week we try very hard to use

756
00:46:50,060 --> 00:46:54,570
general principles of fairness and
anticipate its many of the issues

757
00:46:54,570 --> 00:46:58,220
her times a week so what the processes
are going to be

758
00:46:58,220 --> 00:47:05,220
thanks thanks

759
00:47:10,940 --> 00:47:17,940
okay

760
00:47:23,770 --> 00:47:27,109
money does broker am a broad question
and

761
00:47:27,109 --> 00:47:30,130
in Dec to fundamental protocols

762
00:47:30,130 --> 00:47:33,770
and to basically run the internet one
ish BGP

763
00:47:33,770 --> 00:47:38,349
border gateway protocol just use in
rousing the other one is dns

764
00:47:38,349 --> 00:47:42,230
these courses you see the naming system
and both

765
00:47:42,230 --> 00:47:45,630
over the last few years have seen quite
a development of of

766
00:47:45,630 --> 00:47:48,660
security around its yup in BB have

767
00:47:48,660 --> 00:47:51,930
RPI for instance am Russia Cuba to be

768
00:47:51,930 --> 00:47:56,000
an Indian ashey hefty in a sec now I
happen to know that you've been quite

769
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:57,460
involves Indian check

770
00:47:57,460 --> 00:48:00,540
and I wonder if you could elaborate a
little bit of

771
00:48:00,540 --> 00:48:03,839
of the importance of the anesthetic and

772
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:07,550
for me just just full disclosure I know
this guy

773
00:48:07,550 --> 00:48:11,599
I don't know I was surprised to see me
right in the eye and

774
00:48:11,599 --> 00:48:15,770
this is Roy errands for my Nominet he
too has been very heavily involved in

775
00:48:15,770 --> 00:48:18,950
day in a sec among other things um sorry

776
00:48:18,950 --> 00:48:22,349
was russian plans it slightly I

777
00:48:22,349 --> 00:48:26,270
I really came last with some sometimes
you just get lucky arm

778
00:48:26,270 --> 00:48:29,700
so wrote asking about security
enhancements

779
00:48:29,700 --> 00:48:33,310
at to layers in the protocol is stack

780
00:48:33,310 --> 00:48:37,130
one at the routing layer the border
gateway protocol BGP

781
00:48:37,130 --> 00:48:41,329
are and there have been plenty of
instances

782
00:48:41,329 --> 00:48:44,730
where routing has been diverted are

783
00:48:44,730 --> 00:48:48,310
either on purpose or accidentally one of
the most famous

784
00:48:48,310 --> 00:48:52,220
incidents was Pakistani government of
Pakistan

785
00:48:52,220 --> 00:48:56,020
was annoyed about what was on YouTube
and our

786
00:48:56,020 --> 00:49:00,410
tried to block access to YouTube and the
method that they did that

787
00:49:00,410 --> 00:49:04,380
was to send out that induce some purpose
exactly but

788
00:49:04,380 --> 00:49:07,810
it worked out that they caused are
routing

789
00:49:07,810 --> 00:49:10,980
updates to be sent out that effectively
blocked

790
00:49:10,980 --> 00:49:14,579
access to you too across the entire
world arms

791
00:49:14,579 --> 00:49:17,810
I was not not considered to be a good
thing

792
00:49:17,810 --> 00:49:20,859
are and that these two fundamental
questions of

793
00:49:20,859 --> 00:49:24,329
why is that that a particular country
has the

794
00:49:24,329 --> 00:49:27,460
mechanical ability why it was the
mechanism set up

795
00:49:27,460 --> 00:49:31,579
that has a possibility up having that
dramatic affect

796
00:49:31,579 --> 00:49:34,720
intended or unintended doesn't matter

797
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:38,140
on be like

798
00:49:38,140 --> 00:49:42,960
you leaving the on controls for major
pieces

799
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:45,980
infrastructure exposed on the street on

800
00:49:45,980 --> 00:49:49,270
and just hope that nobody a misuse loves
the other

801
00:49:49,270 --> 00:49:53,240
are layer in the protocol that the Royal
refer to is the

802
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:58,609
domain name system a itself and we put a
lot of work into adding a security

803
00:49:58,609 --> 00:50:01,900
extension to that called in a sec arm

804
00:50:01,900 --> 00:50:04,960
as Roy said I've been very heavily
involved in in a sec for

805
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:08,960
long time for a decade boss arm

806
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:13,020
and that involves adding cryptographic
signatures

807
00:50:13,020 --> 00:50:17,000
to every record every record in the
entire

808
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:20,680
on a domain name system from top to
bottom arm

809
00:50:20,680 --> 00:50:24,710
not at the level of his own but at each
record within the zone

810
00:50:24,710 --> 00:50:27,790
and not only adding those signatures
there but the

811
00:50:27,790 --> 00:50:30,670
they're no good unless somebody actually
checked the signatures and so the other

812
00:50:30,670 --> 00:50:32,020
half of that puzzle

813
00:50:32,020 --> 00:50:35,079
is to help are all the

814
00:50:35,079 --> 00:50:39,869
elements that look up names are
recursive resolvers and systems ideally

815
00:50:39,869 --> 00:50:43,530
check those signatures to make sure that
they're accurate and discard

816
00:50:43,530 --> 00:50:47,050
I'll look up so that Arden don't have
valid signatures

817
00:50:47,050 --> 00:50:50,550
that's a big challenge its conceptually
simple

818
00:50:50,550 --> 00:50:55,280
but would it faces the same issue so how
do you get people to adopt cloud

819
00:50:55,280 --> 00:51:00,020
we're part way there the route top-level
are accused sign four years ago

820
00:51:00,020 --> 00:51:03,190
the are most of the top level domains

821
00:51:03,190 --> 00:51:07,060
arm all the major top-level domains and
many of the other

822
00:51:07,060 --> 00:51:10,300
smaller top-level domains have been
signed

823
00:51:10,300 --> 00:51:14,329
that I can I'm pleased to say that as
part of the new

824
00:51:14,329 --> 00:51:17,550
couple doing programs or call the
generic top-level domains

825
00:51:17,550 --> 00:51:20,560
we we put in from the very beginning

826
00:51:20,560 --> 00:51:24,220
a requirement that the new top-level
domains had to be signed

827
00:51:24,220 --> 00:51:28,170
from day one so when they go into
operation there there's a

828
00:51:28,170 --> 00:51:32,290
are on so-called DS record in the root
for them

829
00:51:32,290 --> 00:51:36,510
arm adoption down at the next lawyers
has been our

830
00:51:36,510 --> 00:51:40,650
much slower in on the checking side we
have some

831
00:51:40,650 --> 00:51:46,250
some good news in the form of our ISP's
a handful ISP's around the world

832
00:51:46,250 --> 00:51:49,430
Telia in Sweden and surf know than the
no loans

833
00:51:49,430 --> 00:51:54,720
comcast in the US and and several others
that I've been aggressively supporting

834
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:58,470
Rd in a sec %uh that's a good news bad
news here's

835
00:51:58,470 --> 00:52:02,430
up there has not been a stampede by all
their brother and

836
00:52:02,430 --> 00:52:05,829
other eyes peas to equally support that

837
00:52:05,829 --> 00:52:08,890
on if you wanna make some noise ask

838
00:52:08,890 --> 00:52:12,750
about repeatedly in every quarter that
can how come

839
00:52:12,750 --> 00:52:16,170
these are two main is inside how come
we're not checking

840
00:52:16,170 --> 00:52:22,460
%uh lookups are and build some buzz you
guys can do that

841
00:52:22,460 --> 00:52:29,460
thank you all

842
00:52:29,770 --> 00:52:30,040
thank you
