were come to my talk I will talk about
all time this nice topic here

2
00:00:04,690 --> 00:00:08,250
you I be dressing attacks on Android
device 02 by sis

3
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:14,750
revisited I s maybe some of you already
know I have given the store

4
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:18,660
and the on I would Dhabi

5
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:22,029
like Konferenz in at the end of 2012

6
00:00:22,029 --> 00:00:25,949
and so on at this time it will be a new
version

7
00:00:25,949 --> 00:00:31,099
and for this reason we can find be
revisited term inside the title

8
00:00:31,099 --> 00:00:34,210
so I will show you some new attack
techniques

9
00:00:34,210 --> 00:00:39,250
so I 0 day which is totally new and some
at the end he will see

10
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:42,870
that we can yeah hecho poem

11
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:46,469
every Android phone which is available
at the moment

12
00:00:46,469 --> 00:00:50,250

know it okay them Who Am I R why did I
talk about alt

16
00:01:05,409 --> 00:01:08,930
why do I talk about this topic well I'm
from being lost

17
00:01:08,930 --> 00:01:13,799
goods Institute on of IT security it
which is in Germany it it's a part of

18
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:14,260
the

19
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:20,009
war University and both home and vera
and doing now my PhD I'm doing some

20
00:01:20,009 --> 00:01:22,610
research stuff regarding cross-site
scripting

21
00:01:22,610 --> 00:01:27,250
arm clickjacking or are you I V dressing
and Tom

22
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:32,909
mall sp over last top 10 the site that

23
00:01:32,909 --> 00:01:38,110
I am the CEO of the new company which
has free curity armbar reason is that

24
00:01:38,110 --> 00:01:41,799
I am I'm giving security trainings and
penetration tests

25
00:01:41,799 --> 00:01:46,610
on in the fields of web application
security especially for the all those

26
00:01:46,610 --> 00:01:47,210
things

27
00:01:47,210 --> 00:01:50,640
on since the last maybe ten years

28
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:53,820
and Tom for a reason but I

29
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:57,219
really love you I'm addressing that's my
girlfriends is

30
00:01:57,219 --> 00:02:02,140
that I there is all this but I haven't
bought a book about it and German

31
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:05,860
which is called click taking on too I V
dressing on this and in

32
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:11,510
in John on and Tom as is maybe two
hundred pages long and contains a lot of

33
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:13,450
things a lot of attack techniques were a

34
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:16,690
if you're able to read a book in drama
now I have a look

35
00:02:16,690 --> 00:02:20,220
come yeah I'm also speaker at

36
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:23,239
some conferences I think it was where

37
00:02:23,239 --> 00:02:28,340
30 effort in the last two years among
them the black hat conference Abu Dhabi

38
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:31,060
blue hat which is the one from Microsoft
in Redmond

39
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:35,260
are some conferences in Russia and
Germany and so on so on

40
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:38,769
more or less a talk and up at all of
them

41
00:02:38,769 --> 00:02:42,260
a ball it's on you I V dressing you can
also fight me

42
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:46,840
on Twitter so this is over a table of
contents looks like

43
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:50,920
we will begin with him to pick an
introduction an amp with a conclusion

44
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:51,629
and outlook

45
00:02:51,629 --> 00:02:55,670
between I we will see I'm at point to
hear

46
00:02:55,670 --> 00:02:58,739
are what's you I'm addressing what's the
public more let's

47
00:02:58,739 --> 00:03:02,040
on this means which attacks are
available

48
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:06,430
on the best all based off-field after
that I will show you

49
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:09,450
which a text can be ported to Android

50
00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:13,209
which isn't really new research by
that's my research and

51
00:03:13,209 --> 00:03:18,239
this new point for we will see some new
brawls less attacks

52
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:21,510
and depending on this 14 depending on
the

53
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:24,530
new but also less attacks on the show
you some integration techniques

54
00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:28,269
against you I V dressing or robert Half
checking which is

55
00:03:28,269 --> 00:03:32,360
in you think your so introduction

56
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:37,159
arm I'm from germany as you can hear it
from an excellent

57
00:03:37,159 --> 00:03:40,519
and for this reason I am

58
00:03:40,519 --> 00:03:44,659
yeah have some historical mall that's
about the German

59
00:03:44,659 --> 00:03:48,090
on technology market and some as you can
see your

60
00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:52,610
their happen something in July 1999 but
until a Kombi

61
00:03:52,610 --> 00:03:55,640
now I think largest telecommunication

62
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:59,930
company and Germany who is offering
Internet connections

63
00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:05,629
on more by the by so this on telephone
call and connections

64
00:04:05,629 --> 00:04:09,780
arm offered broken connection see at
this time

65
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:12,950
and this along with us with DS L to

66
00:04:12,950 --> 00:04:16,410
serve a lot of pasta or and

67
00:04:16,410 --> 00:04:21,419
due to this broadband connections that
disapproved a huge problem I miss you

68
00:04:21,419 --> 00:04:21,669
too

69
00:04:21,579 --> 00:04:24,960
problem we are free program freemen
number phone calls

70
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:29,259
on cost by diarist soapy

71
00:04:29,259 --> 00:04:32,759
dialer problem disappeared for more or
less

72
00:04:32,759 --> 00:04:37,220
ten years as they can see it here and a
new aids

73
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:41,229
arava since 2009 the diarist

74
00:04:41,229 --> 00:04:46,020
rather again bear because we have
smartphones we have telephones with

75
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:49,540
computer is inside of them

76
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:54,780
we can play mo by a a games on all
smartphone on a lot tablets

77
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:57,780
or other devices

78
00:04:57,780 --> 00:05:01,270
and when you talk about that Exxon Mobil
it based devices

79
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:05,550
aren't we talk about alt are usually we
talk about alt Troy and also spitz means

80
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:07,389
what it means to be a using

81
00:05:07,389 --> 00:05:12,110
on a web browser as a Picton on to south
on the Internet

82
00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:15,110
we r clicking on the link or

83
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:18,240
clicking on elements and by doing this

84
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:21,550
we get infected by for example
JavaScript court with his

85
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:26,680
which was executed Ahmed our browser

86
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:30,710
the other thing as and this isn't
actually an attack

87
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:33,940
it's that be can install applications
which

88
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:37,690
on have a lot of commissions a good
example is

89
00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:42,030
wats app what's up can for example I

90
00:05:42,030 --> 00:05:47,970
to locate your netbook Bay stater it can
send SMS it can send as a MMS

91
00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:51,039
it can directly call phone numbers it
can

92
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:54,370
reach your contact data it can many
people later contact better

93
00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:57,910
so at least in my mind it's a

94
00:05:57,910 --> 00:06:03,259
in deal spying to for the NSA or offer
secret services

95
00:06:03,259 --> 00:06:07,440
cyl as a sadness is not an attack it's
just an application

96
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:11,220
with many many rights and I think is a
really necessary

97
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:14,259
that this application has visit rights

98
00:06:14,259 --> 00:06:18,090
dozens let them is it really necessary
but this application is able to call the

99
00:06:18,090 --> 00:06:19,030
phone number

100
00:06:19,030 --> 00:06:23,509
especially is this is it really
necessary but this application is able

101
00:06:23,509 --> 00:06:26,580
to call a premium phone call number
which costs ball

102
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:31,370
through our free euro/dollar for one
minute

103
00:06:31,370 --> 00:06:36,870
and the question the yeah the primary
question office talk as

104
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:41,000
can we as an attacker build an
application which has in all rights to

105
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:41,919
do

106
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:45,270
up for example phone calls or read
contact data were

107
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:50,990
and re: how is it possible to do that

108
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:54,190
on so we have an application like a
calculator

109
00:06:54,190 --> 00:06:58,900
well which can nothing more Ben
calculate so mathematical

110
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:02,360
things and Tom is the supplication a lil

111
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:05,610
to call is this application to set on
the Internet

112
00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:09,970
the salt having any rights and this is
possible and I show you

113
00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:15,669
how sale let's begin with the public
knowledge part

114
00:07:15,669 --> 00:07:19,840
you I'm dressing as a problem which is
known since 2002

115
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:23,930
the back on story behind that is that
Jesse ru demand a security researcher

116
00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:25,250
from the

117
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:29,039
United States published arm in the
muzzle a bug tracker

118
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:32,569
but it is possible to make elements

119
00:07:32,569 --> 00:07:36,280
transparent arava to make iframe
backrounds

120
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:39,460
transplant and some

121
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:43,889
this take it inside the back take up was
close but the muzzle a security team

122
00:07:43,889 --> 00:07:47,650
YouTube a reason that this had minutes
more featuring the Bach

123
00:07:47,650 --> 00:07:51,319
me one fed things are invisible

124
00:07:51,319 --> 00:07:54,580
you want things a half transparent

125
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:58,889
it's nice to have its healthy aunt

126
00:07:58,889 --> 00:08:02,460
viz security problem from 2002

127
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:06,180
appears again with a kid again in 2008

128
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:10,990
and this problem was called click taking
click checking consists of two World

129
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:14,949
up two of two worlds I'm a first brought
us clicking or click

130
00:08:14,949 --> 00:08:20,310
and the second bus hijacking so we
hijack clicks with clickjacking

131
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:25,340
and as you can see year click taking is
a part of you I V dressing so you I we

132
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:27,270
dressing as a set of attacks

133
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:30,910
and inside the said there I'll some Ivor

134
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:35,019
attacks and one operable set of a text

135
00:08:35,019 --> 00:08:38,550
is called quit taking so my wait a
moment

136
00:08:38,550 --> 00:08:42,630
asshat click checking as an attack and
then I say

137
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:45,810
click taking is a subset

138
00:08:45,810 --> 00:08:51,269
of attacks mmm you will see why

139
00:08:51,269 --> 00:08:54,300
and want two minutes so

140
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:58,450
we can also see here is that we have are
attacks inside of quit taking

141
00:08:58,450 --> 00:09:02,640
which are called projecting of hijacking
to checking and so on

142
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:05,850
but let C be attack from 2000

143
00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:11,180
8 so a short video

144
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:16,500
which was published at is year

145
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:19,589
that's run so we see here but we have a

146
00:09:19,589 --> 00:09:23,830
flexibly cation on the website which is
we are not met

147
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:27,330
and victimless going to this website

148
00:09:27,330 --> 00:09:30,440
plan on and sees oh I can get some high
score if I click

149
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:33,680
combatants and in this case victims
clicking

150
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:36,810
lot of buttons on a lot of buttons and
on

151
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:41,630
you can see that P scoring trees this
year

152
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:45,279
so few moments later we will see that
the attacker

153
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:49,180
arava agree I dot net gets automatic
only access to the microphone and camera

154
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:50,260
of a victim

155
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:55,050
you know so and now with a half
transparent background so the white

156
00:09:55,050 --> 00:09:56,870
background is hot transplant

157
00:09:56,870 --> 00:10:03,200
in a few moments

158
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:07,040
so we can see that in the background
very slow dirt Adobe Flash Player

159
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,240
security settings web page

160
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:12,550
or offer in the past Michael media it's
now a days

161
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:16,079
Adobe and we can see that the clicks

162
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:19,990
are allowing we are taught net to get
access to the microphone and to get

163
00:10:19,990 --> 00:10:21,589
access to the

164
00:10:21,589 --> 00:10:27,269
webcam

165
00:10:27,269 --> 00:10:32,100
so here's a list of web sites we're not
that will appear here

166
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:36,620
in a few moments

167
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:40,510
year is it now and what we need now is
that we can

168
00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:44,120
we have to see what this element and
after that we have to click on

169
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:48,829
always lolol to get at the automatically
exits

170
00:10:48,829 --> 00:10:52,620
Veritas that's all and

171
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:57,930
after this beget the excess so this was
fixed by Adobe

172
00:10:57,930 --> 00:11:04,930
and this post cope with checking at this
time

173
00:11:10,579 --> 00:11:13,720
click checking is now a days more being
clicking

174
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:17,639
on the bottom and for this reason which
i think is called classic

175
00:11:17,639 --> 00:11:21,069
clickjacking and a classic look taking a
tech

176
00:11:21,069 --> 00:11:24,660
from today looks like that

177
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:28,839
we are a victim a locked in on the big
talk on being not con- website

178
00:11:28,839 --> 00:11:32,209
you can see it here be we have an
account name which is Marco's

179
00:11:32,209 --> 00:11:35,489
so my name we have ru on the right side

180
00:11:35,489 --> 00:11:38,759
sign all think and what we want is that
the

181
00:11:38,759 --> 00:11:42,509
victim will click on the same all
cleaning without getting

182
00:11:42,509 --> 00:11:45,889
noticed that he or she is clicking on on
it

183
00:11:45,889 --> 00:11:48,980
so what we need is social engineering

184
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:52,639
you know we have a headline hear a funny
picture us we have two smileys on the

185
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:53,100
bottom

186
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:57,410
aunt what the victim more paying

187
00:11:57,410 --> 00:12:01,139
when he or she on this with it visiting
such a website is

188
00:12:01,139 --> 00:12:06,089
pay if I click on click me I will see
some pictures with maybe

189
00:12:06,089 --> 00:12:10,189
kittens and funny docks and so on
TinyPic tourists

190
00:12:10,189 --> 00:12:13,269
so I have to click on it and

191
00:12:13,269 --> 00:12:16,730
by clicking on it you will actually take
on South

192
00:12:16,730 --> 00:12:21,389
you can see here that we have an iframe
a woman's which is slowing been locked

193
00:12:21,389 --> 00:12:22,119
call

194
00:12:22,119 --> 00:12:27,339
and that be want to merge or other
overlay be signed all clink

195
00:12:27,339 --> 00:12:30,600
which is in the eye from a lament overby

196
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:34,339
click the button so you can see it here
remove its to be

197
00:12:34,339 --> 00:12:37,939
top left also battling and Lee

198
00:12:37,939 --> 00:12:42,119
I from elements Alba our button and here

199
00:12:42,119 --> 00:12:45,269
is the iframe transparent so he of
transparent

200
00:12:45,269 --> 00:12:49,189
yet completely transparent so if I click
on this button here I will actually take

201
00:12:49,189 --> 00:12:49,899
on a cold

202
00:12:49,899 --> 00:12:56,389
that's all so when we have a look at you
I'm addressing

203
00:12:56,389 --> 00:13:00,860
are we look at this head of the techs
you can't see that we have the subset

204
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:01,610
click taking

205
00:13:01,610 --> 00:13:06,639
and that we have a text like stroke take
a neck and neck and drop a text content

206
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:09,269
extraction even recycling SPG Mustangs

207
00:13:09,269 --> 00:13:12,399
and here is also lets with a lot of
checkins

208
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:15,809
and this is a little bit difficult to
explain and this so

209
00:13:15,809 --> 00:13:19,679
yeah short time but I will show you to a
text

210
00:13:19,679 --> 00:13:23,369
the first one is projecting and

211
00:13:23,369 --> 00:13:28,799
actually the easiest attack so I have

212
00:13:28,799 --> 00:13:32,149
for links your when I click on to

213
00:13:32,149 --> 00:13:35,769
so here for PS and a lot will know with
Bay you too

214
00:13:35,769 --> 00:13:39,329
effect take on wonder appears on the lot
will you miss with the value

215
00:13:39,329 --> 00:13:43,449
one and so on so 1144 22 and free free

216
00:13:43,449 --> 00:13:47,149
I will take on too look what happens
Kulik

217
00:13:47,149 --> 00:13:51,689
I would take on one what on so I would
click on run

218
00:13:51,689 --> 00:13:54,929
click and nothing happens so either
click on for

219
00:13:54,929 --> 00:14:00,149
click and I will actually take on Fri
who

220
00:14:00,149 --> 00:14:03,360
so the magic behind his is

221
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:10,360
this thing here our most rosas nothing
more venom picture and in this case

222
00:14:10,819 --> 00:14:14,929
the background of this picture isn't ret
its transparent

223
00:14:14,929 --> 00:14:19,149
so concede here I actually click with
the top left

224
00:14:19,149 --> 00:14:23,819
office elements i click onto but I
actually take on one so click

225
00:14:23,819 --> 00:14:27,749
irritants once again effect here

226
00:14:27,749 --> 00:14:33,809
take tits text just saw it here when I
click here or maybe

227
00:14:33,809 --> 00:14:38,519
bear sp2 so a little bit

228
00:14:38,519 --> 00:14:45,339
magic with CS escort another thing which
is BBQ is necessity G mas Kings

229
00:14:45,339 --> 00:14:49,879
arm it's a pure you I V dressing attack
as best you can and this is a Firefox

230
00:14:49,879 --> 00:14:51,029
feature only

231
00:14:51,029 --> 00:14:56,350
are mask elements inside all other
elements like frame so I frames

232
00:14:56,350 --> 00:14:59,660
and in this case we can see that we are

233
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:03,860
we have logo here and a Barton

234
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:08,139
and what actually happens is that we are
loading an iframe

235
00:15:08,139 --> 00:15:11,179
which consists of the

236
00:15:11,179 --> 00:15:14,610
when he was a t.a both home such engine

237
00:15:14,610 --> 00:15:17,910
are rich Los the search and engine
inside or chrome

238
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:21,399
in Firefox of the same court we have

239
00:15:21,399 --> 00:15:25,259
is search engine plus on my asking so if
I click here

240
00:15:25,259 --> 00:15:28,439
and scroll a little bit we can really
see

241
00:15:28,439 --> 00:15:32,850
but we are inside of an iframe K gonna
love it up

242
00:15:32,850 --> 00:15:36,490
we can see that I can searchers the

243
00:15:36,490 --> 00:15:39,839
masking is beer

244
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:43,100
cyl that's a problem clickjacking

245
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:49,009
there are some countermeasures

246
00:15:49,009 --> 00:15:52,299
no I don't wanna make it long

247
00:15:52,299 --> 00:15:55,429
we have free bus or so ya script coat

248
00:15:55,429 --> 00:15:59,409
we have HTTP headers like extreme
options

249
00:15:59,409 --> 00:16:02,999
which protects you against click
checking and some other attacks

250
00:16:02,999 --> 00:16:06,139
and Internet Explore we have

251
00:16:06,139 --> 00:16:09,970
susp be content security policy as a
countermeasure but that's not well

252
00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:11,769
implemented a new a Brussels

253
00:16:11,769 --> 00:16:15,970
so it's better to use extreme options or
maybe both

254
00:16:15,970 --> 00:16:19,600
and we have no script which is v

255
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:23,709
I think best security extension for
browsers

256
00:16:23,709 --> 00:16:29,069
you're available for Firefox from George
or maloney

257
00:16:29,069 --> 00:16:34,879
so we know now what you I we dressing is
what click taking is

258
00:16:34,879 --> 00:16:38,579
and for me at least they are rivals the
question

259
00:16:38,579 --> 00:16:42,369
can report the you I'm addressing a text

260
00:16:42,369 --> 00:16:46,639
more by based devices arava to Android
devices

261
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:50,149
and when ice have started with my
research

262
00:16:50,149 --> 00:16:53,220
I arm which was in

263
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:57,839
2011 so for years ago

264
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:01,549
I its orbit the market research
jewishness the following

265
00:17:01,549 --> 00:17:07,610
we have here small market share for
Android

266
00:17:07,610 --> 00:17:10,939
Symbian as mayor and just a little bit
of I O S so

267
00:17:10,939 --> 00:17:15,279
here is he Iowa spot

268
00:17:15,279 --> 00:17:18,360
and also Huron year later we can see

269
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:21,470
android data on the market share for
Android increased

270
00:17:21,470 --> 00:17:24,619
and year

271
00:17:24,619 --> 00:17:29,090
once again Symbian it decreased in this
case

272
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:33,669
and I O S

273
00:17:33,669 --> 00:17:38,580
when we have a look at 2012 we can see
that Android has a market share or had a

274
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:41,119
market share of 66 percent

275
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:44,169
and in 2014

276
00:17:44,169 --> 00:17:49,260
nearly 80 process so it's reworked to
look at Android because I mean

277
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:52,760
I US has a market share our nearly
fifteen percent

278
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:57,190
thats nothing comparison to enright

279
00:17:57,190 --> 00:18:00,250
and when we look at russians

280
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:04,490
which are in use already East which are
in use in in Germany

281
00:18:04,490 --> 00:18:08,200
we can see that most of the people I
using Android 2.2 X

282
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:11,520
you know the reason for this

283
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:14,580
is that

284
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:17,960
be have mobile phones and Germany

285
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:22,049
which arm are for example motor without
the if he

286
00:18:22,049 --> 00:18:25,460
and such a Motorola DP'd by its I'm

287
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:28,960
holds Android version like

288
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:33,169
2.1 and we can upgraded to 2.2

289
00:18:33,169 --> 00:18:36,940
yeah which scares me a little bit but
this is the case in Germany

290
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:41,020
and it most the possible Europe

291
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:44,129
nevertheless all of the attacks I will
show you are working on

292
00:18:44,129 --> 00:18:47,500
all worlds since to dot X

293
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:50,820
so also in reversion for but X

294
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:54,149
and freedom X here are some

295
00:18:54,149 --> 00:18:57,740
some screenshots we can see but we have
a notification bar on the top

296
00:18:57,740 --> 00:19:01,360
in both worms so and right to an Android
4

297
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:06,200
on the top a notification bar when we
have a search engine fought with Google

298
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:10,179
we have a home screen and we have some
but this year so we can

299
00:19:10,179 --> 00:19:13,350
to a phone call we can open the menu
weekend

300
00:19:13,350 --> 00:19:19,409
surf they are not so many differences
between Bieber since you're

301
00:19:19,409 --> 00:19:24,000
at least if they are not customized

302
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,289
so the next step about looking have

303
00:19:27,289 --> 00:19:32,840
the Android RB you I'm addressing
attacks can be ported is

304
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:36,480
to have a look at the available browsers
and

305
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:41,679
what we can see is that Firefox is
available so the Gecko engine

306
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:47,200
we have chrome so wet kit or probably at
the moment

307
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:50,440
we have all-pro with pesto in the past

308
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:53,830
pressed was also available on some TV's
you know

309
00:19:53,830 --> 00:19:58,389
but nowadays VA switched at least in the
best the best feel too

310
00:19:58,389 --> 00:20:01,760
on link so the same ask Oprah

311
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:05,369
by escrow what been what happened as

312
00:20:05,369 --> 00:20:09,030
Saif Ali and Internet Explorer but

313
00:20:09,030 --> 00:20:12,059
this is in really important for us
because

314
00:20:12,059 --> 00:20:15,619
but it's just one attack which is
working at it's a party

315
00:20:15,619 --> 00:20:21,980
and just one attack which is working in
Internet Explorer

316
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:26,099
still you can see here for example that
three attacks can be

317
00:20:26,099 --> 00:20:29,559
easy be the be ported because the only
thing what

318
00:20:29,559 --> 00:20:34,090
a brothel needs an hour cases but it
supports frame so I frames

319
00:20:34,090 --> 00:20:37,720
but it supports cascading style sheets
CSS code

320
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:40,830
endoscopy called so as

321
00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:43,889
possible and are in every browser San
every Bros

322
00:20:43,889 --> 00:20:48,210
available what we can see here bill
Summit X which

323
00:20:48,210 --> 00:20:53,539
I using some brawls were specific few
truths like Gollum

324
00:20:53,539 --> 00:20:56,679
some attributes that kid directory for
example in chrome

325
00:20:56,679 --> 00:21:00,639
no which is necessary for hijacking

326
00:21:00,639 --> 00:21:03,659
you know and type checking which is

327
00:21:03,659 --> 00:21:07,570
which we try as Firefox so but all of
those things

328
00:21:07,570 --> 00:21:12,220
I V E R we have chrome we have to offer
our and we have Firefox

329
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:16,270
a text which doesn't work as click
taking the pole because he doesn't have

330
00:21:16,270 --> 00:21:17,099
clicked

331
00:21:17,099 --> 00:21:20,149
you balance on Android device will speak
and

332
00:21:20,149 --> 00:21:24,740
use our crews about bizarre actually
touch events not click events

333
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:29,240
we don't can cannot do KK checking with
because the trials

334
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:33,770
Windows we have Robert taps

335
00:21:33,770 --> 00:21:37,629
and not when also mobile phones or tell
what this is

336
00:21:37,629 --> 00:21:42,669
and cookie checking because it's an
Internet Explorer base attack

337
00:21:42,669 --> 00:21:48,330
okay all new role as a text

338
00:21:48,330 --> 00:21:52,520
when we look at and roared

339
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:56,099
we can see its young the emulator that

340
00:21:56,099 --> 00:22:00,299
we can do for example all things like

341
00:22:00,299 --> 00:22:03,409
make the volume louder no

342
00:22:03,409 --> 00:22:06,470
for you I can do this or

343
00:22:06,470 --> 00:22:12,070
you bit crucial things are

344
00:22:12,070 --> 00:22:15,869
be a transparent but can be transparent
this notification messages

345
00:22:15,869 --> 00:22:20,460
miss you they disappear after a few
seconds so that this appeal

346
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:24,470
after two or three seconds they can also
disappear after one second

347
00:22:24,470 --> 00:22:28,010
and I can click on that so yep click

348
00:22:28,010 --> 00:22:31,490
and we can see I actually clicked on the
Google com search bar

349
00:22:31,490 --> 00:22:37,179
so once again is free things are very
important

350
00:22:37,179 --> 00:22:44,179
click I can click under it so its
transfer and for my actions

351
00:22:44,619 --> 00:22:49,639
so the idea behind the new brawl select
attacked a brosser les attack is not all

352
00:22:49,639 --> 00:22:54,409
apollo weighing isn't it possible to

353
00:22:54,409 --> 00:22:57,970
make such modifications missile
notification message

354
00:22:57,970 --> 00:23:01,760
I'll to full screen to resize that

355
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:05,480
well and is not possible to show it for
longer time than

356
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:09,210
just free seconds

357
00:23:09,210 --> 00:23:14,919
as possible and the result is the
following:

358
00:23:14,919 --> 00:23:18,399
%um I will show it to you

359
00:23:18,399 --> 00:23:23,980
your personal all arm efforts said we
have an application which has no rights

360
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:27,119
to do an effing to do for example phone
calls

361
00:23:27,119 --> 00:23:31,330
so if I'll

362
00:23:31,330 --> 00:23:35,710
was that your applications manage
applications

363
00:23:35,710 --> 00:23:40,590
open for example the API demo also I
conceive that there are some permissions

364
00:23:40,590 --> 00:23:44,080
also this application is a lot or

365
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:48,530
reach your personal information to take
pictures and saw

366
00:23:48,530 --> 00:23:51,700
so in this case it will open type
checking up the kitchen

367
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:55,659
which is for example my calculator

368
00:23:55,659 --> 00:23:59,099
and we can see but it hasn't any rights
no

369
00:23:59,099 --> 00:24:04,169
so no rights here just a calculator or
just an application

370
00:24:04,169 --> 00:24:11,169
for sooo computer game for some them so
I opened the supplication you

371
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:16,580
we can see that there appears

372
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:21,220
the window which is actually the
notification message

373
00:24:21,220 --> 00:24:24,700
and a button and click on this button
and look at the top left

374
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:27,859
but I did I made a phone call

375
00:24:27,859 --> 00:24:31,619
so the magic behind this

376
00:24:31,619 --> 00:24:35,270
so following my closet you can see that
I'm

377
00:24:35,270 --> 00:24:39,359
I'm calling this the fool by Hugh

378
00:24:39,359 --> 00:24:44,820
in the call silno with a heart
transplant or Robert transplant back on

379
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:46,330
what what

380
00:24:46,330 --> 00:24:52,389
you can see that I have about you but I
have to do not press

381
00:24:52,389 --> 00:24:56,629
Wirtz and but I have a application in
the background in this application is

382
00:24:56,629 --> 00:24:57,990
the focal application

383
00:24:57,990 --> 00:25:01,049
so an application resulting writes this
able

384
00:25:01,049 --> 00:25:04,529
to open another application now is able
to open

385
00:25:04,529 --> 00:25:10,159
the conduct a tour the focal application
eat web browser

386
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:13,899
when be count them you know our
application is

387
00:25:13,899 --> 00:25:17,599
able to open 16 other applications

388
00:25:17,599 --> 00:25:22,559
by using intend action in android

389
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:25,730
so once again you can see

390
00:25:25,730 --> 00:25:29,450
of local application in the background
from predefined number and all I need is

391
00:25:29,450 --> 00:25:33,210
a click your

392
00:25:33,210 --> 00:25:36,260
and Pixie that I'm actually

393
00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:43,260
doing a phone call so

394
00:25:45,070 --> 00:25:49,760
business what happens I have my
notification

395
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:54,039
and I have my Tiger application in the
background by clicking on the

396
00:25:54,039 --> 00:25:55,029
notification

397
00:25:55,029 --> 00:25:58,260
I will actually pick under its because

398
00:25:58,260 --> 00:26:03,399
they are transfer and for actions

399
00:26:03,399 --> 00:26:07,389
so what can an attacker do and attacker
can

400
00:26:07,389 --> 00:26:10,470
many people ate contact later

401
00:26:10,470 --> 00:26:14,460
it can use your browser to serve on web
pages

402
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:17,649
it can close the browser in the
background

403
00:26:17,649 --> 00:26:21,059
it can local touch keys tres so

404
00:26:21,059 --> 00:26:25,669
we have a cure it can do predefined
phone calls

405
00:26:25,669 --> 00:26:28,970
is all that and this was fixed by Google

406
00:26:28,970 --> 00:26:32,549
and this was your day for today it can
and

407
00:26:32,549 --> 00:26:36,260
they are applications in the background
with more

408
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:40,849
commissions so we can stay on
application

409
00:26:40,849 --> 00:26:44,220
with the help of an application which
has no right and this

410
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:48,820
new application can for example do all
things on your phone like it as in the

411
00:26:48,820 --> 00:26:49,849
case of

412
00:26:49,849 --> 00:26:56,849
what's at let me show that in a video

413
00:26:57,529 --> 00:27:02,409
apps it's the wrong one

414
00:27:02,409 --> 00:27:05,429
so these videos by Nicole Smith's

415
00:27:05,429 --> 00:27:10,000
security researcher from the stuff you
know sure all cool it is called in

416
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:10,859
Germany

417
00:27:10,859 --> 00:27:14,659
we can see it here that I'm

418
00:27:14,659 --> 00:27:17,869
he opened VVN Reuters some settings

419
00:27:17,869 --> 00:27:21,869
to show that up this when steeled after
vet Res opening the target application

420
00:27:21,869 --> 00:27:22,889
here

421
00:27:22,889 --> 00:27:25,909
and BC that use social touch on

422
00:27:25,909 --> 00:27:29,490
this I can have a touching on this I can
bear appeared you something

423
00:27:29,490 --> 00:27:33,279
I will show it to you again because it
was very very fast

424
00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:37,710
cyl us once again

425
00:27:37,710 --> 00:27:42,260
you know yes gotta diversion in a few
seconds

426
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:46,070
so with this touch his true he shows

427
00:27:46,070 --> 00:27:49,159
there is no update available

428
00:27:49,159 --> 00:27:53,220
when he opens the target application and
please look your

429
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:56,409
at the notification bar will appear
something

430
00:27:56,409 --> 00:27:59,599
but touching on this I can hear

431
00:27:59,599 --> 00:28:04,760
here isn't stellar application just to a
free seconds

432
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:08,159
saw what actually happens this

433
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:15,159
the following now all again with a
transparent background

434
00:28:15,749 --> 00:28:19,159
he shows in this case that we can

435
00:28:19,159 --> 00:28:22,230
tool for example fortifications weekend

436
00:28:22,230 --> 00:28:26,220
but we can push some messages sent some
messages and so on

437
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:30,320
know he moves at and opens the

438
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:34,509
a replication

439
00:28:34,509 --> 00:28:37,889
which is there and we can see

440
00:28:37,889 --> 00:28:40,970
here in a few moments that there a PSP
Google

441
00:28:40,970 --> 00:28:44,149
play market for a few moments and that
is a that the touch

442
00:28:44,149 --> 00:28:48,480
Easter on this place your

443
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:52,700
instead an application in the back row
and once again this application has no

444
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:53,570
rights

445
00:28:53,570 --> 00:28:56,999
to do this it has actually

446
00:28:56,999 --> 00:29:03,999
0 rights

447
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:08,660
so what we have learnt is that

448
00:29:08,660 --> 00:29:11,830
their work we can use notification

449
00:29:11,830 --> 00:29:15,610
messages with combined with social
engineering

450
00:29:15,610 --> 00:29:18,910
to trick the user and to do

451
00:29:18,910 --> 00:29:21,920
a lot of things like phone calls like
unfailing implications

452
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:25,760
which was actually fix by Google but
it's still possible as we can

453
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:30,190
see it and some

454
00:29:30,190 --> 00:29:33,400
nevertheless therapy is the question can
I attack

455
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:36,570
more ben-veniste 16 applications

456
00:29:36,570 --> 00:29:39,840
which are available by using intent
action

457
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:43,890
and then right and the answer is

458
00:29:43,890 --> 00:29:46,920
yes of course

459
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:50,550
because we can click on the menu bar

460
00:29:50,550 --> 00:29:55,280
to concede you so for example

461
00:29:55,280 --> 00:30:00,260
you what I need in my game in my
application like a key later

462
00:30:00,260 --> 00:30:03,290
click on this point for example

463
00:30:03,290 --> 00:30:06,780
in Ventura and for example here

464
00:30:06,780 --> 00:30:10,440
and then EG you you know so

465
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:14,410
what we need is an attacker are a lot of
clicks on the victim

466
00:30:14,410 --> 00:30:18,620
on the right places which is little bit
difficult but it can be done with a lot

467
00:30:18,620 --> 00:30:19,010
of

468
00:30:19,010 --> 00:30:23,880
touch these trips and if we have this
touch keys to this weekend for example

469
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:24,810
in this is

470
00:30:24,810 --> 00:30:28,630
also possible with intent action many
plate contact better

471
00:30:28,630 --> 00:30:32,510
with just watch the stress we can

472
00:30:32,510 --> 00:30:36,050
save that the victim

473
00:30:36,050 --> 00:30:40,110
is allowed to insane application which
are knots high-end which I'm not from

474
00:30:40,110 --> 00:30:41,210
the Android Market

475
00:30:41,210 --> 00:30:44,420
so which are for example from the
attackers

476
00:30:44,420 --> 00:30:48,270
are application market and

477
00:30:48,270 --> 00:30:52,370
we can wipe we can you race IMO by phone

478
00:30:52,370 --> 00:30:55,790
by in mini mall um only having

479
00:30:55,790 --> 00:30:59,910
6 touch the stress which is nearly
nothing

480
00:30:59,910 --> 00:31:05,060
sale we knew now that

481
00:31:05,060 --> 00:31:09,090
we can control as an attacker the whole
more by four

482
00:31:09,090 --> 00:31:13,810
on there is just one thing necessary and
missus are tied with the application

483
00:31:13,810 --> 00:31:17,790
this is all a calculator which has no
rights and

484
00:31:17,790 --> 00:31:20,800
this cannot be detected by Google just
to say it

485
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:24,550
well make this one count on measure

486
00:31:24,550 --> 00:31:28,040
you know and this countermeasure

487
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:31,210
is called to to touch has been up skirt

488
00:31:31,210 --> 00:31:36,560
which means if you I using this
attribute on effort

489
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:39,570
for your bottom and that this button
will be block

490
00:31:39,570 --> 00:31:42,980
touch these truths which on has

491
00:31:42,980 --> 00:31:47,780
layers over them so which are for
example not visible to the user

492
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:51,320
you know and some as he conceded

493
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:56,390
Europe this yeah countermeasures are
available since

494
00:31:56,390 --> 00:31:59,930
divergent 2.2 so ever Motorola DT with

495
00:31:59,930 --> 00:32:02,970
two daughters one is completely

496
00:32:02,970 --> 00:32:07,690
your is definitely a victim in this case

497
00:32:07,690 --> 00:32:10,930
conclusion all talk

498
00:32:10,930 --> 00:32:16,610
so we know that most of your IP address
in a text can be ported

499
00:32:16,610 --> 00:32:19,850
on Android devices this is definitely no
problem

500
00:32:19,850 --> 00:32:23,020
you but we had just three attacks

501
00:32:23,020 --> 00:32:26,750
in a set all 28 X

502
00:32:26,750 --> 00:32:31,650
which don't work we

503
00:32:31,650 --> 00:32:36,710
can use you I we dressing on the desktop
based field

504
00:32:36,710 --> 00:32:40,580
and also on the mall by based fueled
especially on Android

505
00:32:40,580 --> 00:32:45,970
and the most important thing at least
for me is

506
00:32:45,970 --> 00:32:49,680
that we are able as an attacker

507
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:54,580
to instill applications in the
background and but we were able to

508
00:32:54,580 --> 00:32:59,310
call premium number phone court so to
get

509
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:03,820
money at work on we have offer user and

510
00:33:03,820 --> 00:33:06,990
last but not least there are some
council members like extreme optimistic

511
00:33:06,990 --> 00:33:08,260
on the security policy

512
00:33:08,260 --> 00:33:13,050
and this nice attribute available

513
00:33:13,050 --> 00:33:17,020
but just to say at this attributes is an
integrated

514
00:33:17,020 --> 00:33:21,610
and been a tooth Android app so it is an
integrated

515
00:33:21,610 --> 00:33:26,520
in before collect occasional contact
later application no

516
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:29,540
which is a little bit strange from my
perspective

517
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:32,620
but this is the case Google doesn't
integrate

518
00:33:32,620 --> 00:33:37,320
so that's all

519
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:40,470
thank you for your attention and if you
have any questions

520
00:33:40,470 --> 00:33:47,470
feel free to ask me questions

521
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:53,370
good question arm

522
00:33:53,370 --> 00:33:58,310
the thing is that I'll Estes asking for
permissions to do for example

523
00:33:58,310 --> 00:34:03,120
push notifications you know and if you
give such commissions

524
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:07,100
them then it's possible I was no okay

525
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:14,100
yet

526
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:18,650
nope just on you on a vacation like for
home banking or

527
00:34:18,650 --> 00:34:25,650
other stuff

528
00:34:26,470 --> 00:34:29,770
be aware if you don't have an
application it can be dangerous

529
00:34:29,770 --> 00:34:36,550
even if it hurts no rights amor

530
00:34:36,550 --> 00:34:43,550
questions yes

531
00:34:53,839 --> 00:34:56,649
arm the post

532
00:34:56,649 --> 00:35:03,649
to speak a little bit louder please yep

533
00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:14,250
min

534
00:35:14,250 --> 00:35:19,520
missus right about content action can
actually call just the 16 applications

535
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:22,840
but the user can open your application
when

536
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:28,100
on by clicking on the menu but it's a
little difficult because the icons on

537
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:29,880
the position of the icons can change

538
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:33,930
you know but it's possible if you have
enough

539
00:35:33,930 --> 00:35:40,930
touch the stress

540
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:51,390
once again please

541
00:35:51,390 --> 00:35:54,430
%uh yep their way a of three

542
00:35:54,430 --> 00:35:59,130
applications and the past and someone up
occasional

543
00:35:59,130 --> 00:36:03,300
all wherein the Google market for over

544
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:06,350
I think for months so it was deleted

545
00:36:06,350 --> 00:36:09,460
it was my application I

546
00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:14,940
so um the problem is that Google cannot
detect that

547
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:17,940
now it can just look for some strings

548
00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:21,040
I and for intend action but arm

549
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:24,340
SU maybe all own mill is that

550
00:36:24,340 --> 00:36:28,270
we can use code obfuscation techniques
you know to hide

551
00:36:28,270 --> 00:36:31,870
is strings to change from and

552
00:36:31,870 --> 00:36:35,720
for this reason Google isn't really able
to 22 detected

553
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:38,740
this justice countermeasure

554
00:36:38,740 --> 00:36:42,230
and it isn't used in the native
applications

555
00:36:42,230 --> 00:36:49,230
so number one

556
00:36:50,909 --> 00:36:54,809
okay about us after that or then thank
you very much for being here
