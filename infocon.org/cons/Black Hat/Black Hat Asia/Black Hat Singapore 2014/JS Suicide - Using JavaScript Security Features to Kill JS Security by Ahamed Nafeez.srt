1
00:00:00,269 --> 00:00:04,410
so this is not peace a so to be able to
see our

2
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:08,029
how we can use java scripts a in Billy

3
00:00:08,029 --> 00:00:11,160
inherent security features a to

4
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:16,279
attack its own security implementations
and my bus a few restrictions

5
00:00:16,279 --> 00:00:19,550
great so up just to check

6
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:24,109
a home you'll be here early jealous
commuter bus and development

7
00:00:24,109 --> 00:00:25,380
applications in Jalisco

8
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:30,279
sorry so so

9
00:00:30,279 --> 00:00:34,300
yep up this how today's agenda is going
to look like

10
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:37,780
the stagnant why Telstra this
all-important and

11
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:41,140
the doc specifically among the objects
and what

12
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:44,590
up me JavaScript up stand it has two
talk about it

13
00:00:44,590 --> 00:00:48,640
the ECMAScript feisty and its which came
away recently and

14
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:52,079
the new doc a bold a second design
pattern and then

15
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:56,079
we take a specific example a labor
required class he has had it gone

16
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:59,940
and we like talk about how to find the
scandal early days

17
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:04,030
up doing following a penetration testing
sore how you can have never appropriate

18
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:04,439
to

19
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:08,920
train fits the so up just setting
expectations

20
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:12,619
up as I said it's a vote up trying to
attack

21
00:01:12,619 --> 00:01:17,759
implementations in javascript and up the
orcs have that story and again another

22
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:19,049
thing called on Prime bring

23
00:01:19,049 --> 00:01:24,200
has enough you heard a word I'm coming
before alright

24
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:28,310
up that's what and this is not about the
regular across eight scripting or or to

25
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:29,820
cross and request forgery

26
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:34,060
attack ardent usual stuff you hear in a
javascript security at context we just

27
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:34,350
like

28
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:38,000
don't use go by the labor's and stuff
like that

29
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,619
so who am I R I'm as I said no fees are

30
00:01:42,619 --> 00:01:46,880
so I work as a security engineer for
separates in Bannu

31
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:51,270
a I have some interesting web and it
works especially in the blanks a part of

32
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:51,590
it

33
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:54,939
I believe that in defending and building
up

34
00:01:54,939 --> 00:01:57,649
secure system so much harder than
attacking causing in the first meeting

35
00:01:57,649 --> 00:01:58,630
to act act

36
00:01:58,630 --> 00:02:02,450
before you up go ahead then

37
00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:05,600
defend mr Milne improperly up and

38
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:08,720
this don't miss any person any of my and
briars opinions

39
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:12,650
okay so JavaScript just keep this

40
00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:15,760
something which is their a anywhere up

41
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:18,930
all in a way for them to use all the
devices ABC its

42
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:23,069
it as long as you have a browser and
it's only way to script the bros are so

43
00:02:23,069 --> 00:02:27,459
it so there and it is becoming more
relevant as we go forward

44
00:02:27,459 --> 00:02:30,640
rate so up new going up in all the main
stack

45
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:33,660
but the means that in a bush right so a

46
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:38,370
mean stack a is is a complete up no
obligation stack we can measure

47
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:41,480
elimination using javascript only so

48
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:44,670
if your photo board Mon 20 me it's the

49
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:48,319
database it's a not equal database which
company he works

50
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:52,200
hit you in the face it using javascript
so next the M in the mean

51
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:56,150
and a express express yes and no JS

52
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:59,280
babe solar again by DJ how do we check
if you know him

53
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:03,129
so it's a very famous up bookseller fame
okay night

54
00:03:03,129 --> 00:03:07,659
no JS which is i mean mission I'm
jealous grip and they have the anger JS

55
00:03:07,659 --> 00:03:11,400
which is a glance aid in the supreme ok
my glue and have been OJ s

56
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:15,510
again up which is the suicide a but it's
just got back from

57
00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:19,470
up let's pretty amazing make so we just
learn one language

58
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:23,310
you can read a complete bitch that which
iz not not the case which he is to have

59
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:23,909
before

60
00:03:23,909 --> 00:03:27,370
get so up

61
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:31,260
just limit of Jalisco primer up

62
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:35,190
just got this a fundamentally a very
dynamic language everything is rosy type

63
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:37,310
it's very flexible you can do a lot of
things

64
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:41,810
up but you cannot do in other languages
because of the amount of rhetoric United

65
00:03:41,810 --> 00:03:44,659
polite you are you can go a little bit
deeper and change the only real

66
00:03:44,659 --> 00:03:45,940
implementations which is

67
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:50,180
by that what we talk about today and
just completely object-based

68
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:53,739
everything is treated as an object and
and up

69
00:03:53,739 --> 00:03:57,720
course citizen I've functions are said a
first-class it isn't it in a sense like

70
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:00,260
your functions can also act as a meeting
between you get up

71
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:03,860
object so up me da quad objects

72
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:07,090
up we have two different types of them
which they

73
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:11,430
need to object so up the new object on
the ones which are

74
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:15,650
up provided by the javascripts
specifications itself

75
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:19,419
right something like he or going to die
check the number

76
00:04:19,419 --> 00:04:22,850
RA and even the object so this object
over there is the

77
00:04:22,850 --> 00:04:26,440
mother of our object in javascript so
you can inherit everything else from

78
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:27,630
there is for chambliss

79
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:31,070
REO object miss you need to object can
be inherited from

80
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:36,410
up the main object and they have
something which is the host objects

81
00:04:36,410 --> 00:04:39,810
so up this is something which we need to
really understand

82
00:04:39,810 --> 00:04:44,419
up before we try to take a look at how
that different JavaScript and conditions

83
00:04:44,419 --> 00:04:44,910
work

84
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:47,919
so up as a mi nadie obvious from the
name itself

85
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:51,240
host objects or something reach you not
only use

86
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:54,330
up to interface your javascript

87
00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:58,410
engine with up your a platform for Tampa

88
00:04:58,410 --> 00:05:02,199
up most of you may have had of the b8

89
00:05:02,199 --> 00:05:05,479
JavaScript engine Michael up you

90
00:05:05,479 --> 00:05:09,210
interface that with the browser using
nom host object

91
00:05:09,210 --> 00:05:12,910
you have a complete JavaScript walking
in mind you interface the same thing

92
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:13,380
with the

93
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:16,550
we ate engine with up

94
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:19,949
it email even today when all that and
you have no JS

95
00:05:19,949 --> 00:05:23,570
great so for the roses

96
00:05:23,570 --> 00:05:26,650
your host object to land on which is a
document object model and

97
00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:29,850
for things like node.js or other
platforms whatever

98
00:05:29,850 --> 00:05:33,410
your a javascript implementation doesn't
game by default

99
00:05:33,410 --> 00:05:37,120
you just implemented as be it using the
host object of on OJ's what it's going

100
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:41,889
to media I should he be DNS TCP all
these particles

101
00:05:41,889 --> 00:05:45,250
okay so that shift gears a little bit

102
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:48,949
and grain see up ECMAScript

103
00:05:48,949 --> 00:05:52,509
so up ECMAScript it's it's another name
for JavaScript

104
00:05:52,509 --> 00:05:56,870
there there's been a whole lot of up you
know philosophy and historically

105
00:05:56,870 --> 00:06:00,330
up lot of political reasons in orbit
behind the names have JavaScript enabled

106
00:06:00,330 --> 00:06:01,190
script

107
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:04,889
but a the standard name up according to
specification is

108
00:06:04,889 --> 00:06:08,710
ECMAScript so if you want to implement a
javascript engine our parser

109
00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:12,150
you may see me when looked at Muscat
definitions right so

110
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:16,590
a kindly all the browsers are complying
with the ECMAScript fight

111
00:06:16,590 --> 00:06:20,400
up specifications and it must comply
specifications

112
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:24,020
they gave few up feel any sense

113
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:27,310
to a hoe and object would actually a be
treated

114
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:30,860
great so I'll if you have an object say

115
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:34,169
point so this in the JavaScript or this
is how you

116
00:06:34,169 --> 00:06:37,949
if an object you have a point and you
have a

117
00:06:37,949 --> 00:06:42,020
a as a property and its value is 1 me as
a liberal KS to

118
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:46,100
so up if they have a if you have an
object cocaine in Tampa proffered

119
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:49,430
up so one of the additions of

120
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:53,039
ECM us to fight is something on this
object undefined property:

121
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:56,310
up so you can basically take an object
and its property

122
00:06:56,310 --> 00:06:59,560
and define whatever you want 10 minutes
get there and said that wants to do

123
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:02,910
so up if you've been using javascript
for quite some time you already know

124
00:07:02,910 --> 00:07:03,460
aboard

125
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:06,979
get doesn't it doesn't pretty famous in
javascript shows its power as well

126
00:07:06,979 --> 00:07:10,330
but nowadays you used you you do them
using the object to giving property as a

127
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:12,240
standard

128
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:16,240
so this specific functional here place
to have an object point

129
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:20,389
and had it's probably a and whenever you
call it together a pic which is to say

130
00:07:20,389 --> 00:07:22,009
point guard is the get off

131
00:07:22,009 --> 00:07:25,050
this object up it always against

132
00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:28,389
some value well what you find so even if
you said

133
00:07:28,389 --> 00:07:31,880
something like up why not is going two
hundred

134
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:35,520
its me know when you ask 0.0 day to get
there is always going to a done deal

135
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:38,780
the only speak value

136
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:42,800
so again now how can you up locking dole

137
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:46,919
there's something on as object but the
extensions up

138
00:07:46,919 --> 00:07:50,129
so effing you know if if if you do
through an expansion

139
00:07:50,129 --> 00:07:53,300
on on an object it's basically going to
make sure that

140
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:56,530
you cannot said and other property or
add anything

141
00:07:56,530 --> 00:08:01,160
expect are extend something to it so it
is a point-to-point again by just had

142
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,470
and it's not going to work

143
00:08:02,470 --> 00:08:06,009
BC are all these implementations in crop
quite a bit

144
00:08:06,009 --> 00:08:09,039
so on did not see again up

145
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:12,270
is whatever your object not prevent
extensions would do

146
00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:16,430
in addition you cannot delete something
else so for some we have pointed AR

147
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:17,729
gurney mean defined

148
00:08:17,729 --> 00:08:21,520
you cannot go insane daily point on a
which which wouldn't do it which would

149
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,599
allow you to do it so

150
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:26,750
and again on June but freezes the last
one of the ECMAScript 5

151
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:31,199
a problem is that you can see today up
so I'm not freeze

152
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:34,300
does everything work object got seated
us in addition

153
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:38,219
in price to make sure that you cannot
change the property of

154
00:08:38,219 --> 00:08:42,110
existing up you cannot see the value of
the existing properties

155
00:08:42,110 --> 00:08:45,660
rate so if you have pointed a tape to
some 500 and

156
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:49,149
you cannot or someone has to change the
value so all these have different

157
00:08:49,149 --> 00:08:50,769
different use cases depending upon

158
00:08:50,769 --> 00:08:53,970
up no way you can remain your up

159
00:08:53,970 --> 00:08:58,240
JavaScript up a plain sight for a
fortnight for Time Warner Bros

160
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:01,550
right so if you're if you're Jade Goody
would basically go and say

161
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:04,800
up I would define something I don't make
sure that it's being frozen

162
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:08,410
on you don't freeze of let's say up are
in our prototype

163
00:09:08,410 --> 00:09:12,240
and nobody will be able to change that I
don't want to type implementation

164
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:15,740
so that to all the court up here are a
dork what time is going to remain the

165
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:16,230
same

166
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:19,600
in us in a sense to say in a few lowered
let's say

167
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:23,589
a someone the library you have to agree
and some in the library on it agape

168
00:09:23,589 --> 00:09:26,630
after that that is not going to redefine
what

169
00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:29,880
what you had from object when you had
from Jake Lee

170
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:33,980
great so it's it's already an alleged
abuse case that you want to use it for

171
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:38,120
so I'll let's take a look at it holdings
cool so let's say we have a point I'm

172
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,870
just going to join 28 ambos

173
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:43,500
again just to show how it really works
up

174
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:48,120
just bear with me

175
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:51,220
so we have this point which as the
object a

176
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:55,170
in one so its strain se object or define
property

177
00:09:55,170 --> 00:09:59,330
of

178
00:09:59,330 --> 00:10:02,720
you wanna see it I I want to do the
point

179
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:06,240
and 12 renew finding a trough let's say
a

180
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:10,060
up the property me a property a now it's
a IR

181
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:14,510
something like this

182
00:10:14,510 --> 00:10:21,510
story

183
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:27,829
okay so up you know we had points

184
00:10:27,829 --> 00:10:30,959
up so

185
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:34,839
what it what do you see a point or two
it's a pointer a study even if you say

186
00:10:34,839 --> 00:10:35,509
point north

187
00:10:35,509 --> 00:10:39,279
ace for you're still going to

188
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:43,050
24 history going to get point or pay s
30

189
00:10:43,050 --> 00:10:46,360
so even though internally your point
guard ace

190
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:50,199
up defined as something as you try to
said

191
00:10:50,199 --> 00:10:53,730
said to do something else you're going
to make sure that it 3 defined to

192
00:10:53,730 --> 00:10:54,529
something else

193
00:10:54,529 --> 00:10:58,350
CNN you can do it for us said those as
well you can't change the way

194
00:10:58,350 --> 00:11:01,420
something is being said if someone tries
to say a value for something

195
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:06,050
you can always keep thinking that right
so again object art

196
00:11:06,050 --> 00:11:09,940
brand extensions make sure that

197
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:13,920
he cannot at something so for example if
this is still your point

198
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:18,940
you cannot make sure you can make sure
that point at CES morning said

199
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:21,940
so right doesn't

200
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:25,819
it's it's no point it's been all we can
do something like object but ASEAN

201
00:11:25,819 --> 00:11:28,870
which if you remember we can try to

202
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:32,329
add up me make the connection and you
cannot delete something so

203
00:11:32,329 --> 00:11:39,329
up piece a daily point beats are going
to work you'll be still going to

204
00:11:40,730 --> 00:11:44,470
me said no just showing you are so that
a No

205
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:47,870
just be clear with most of you know
sometimes up honey

206
00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:52,040
me a bit of it and used it so is anyone
without any use this year program so

207
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:55,490
about affect oh that's great

208
00:11:55,490 --> 00:11:59,589
so up again let's so see object but
freeze

209
00:11:59,589 --> 00:12:03,720
for the last time we can go and say I
want to freeze the point object

210
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:06,810
so I no one can basically change so my

211
00:12:06,810 --> 00:12:10,459
value of point Arby's to a face a when
it meets 24

212
00:12:10,459 --> 00:12:13,720
your point would be skilled remains the
same not there's a fundamental

213
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:15,300
difference between this

214
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:19,430
and the way we saw object undefined
property: IFN property changes the value

215
00:12:19,430 --> 00:12:22,550
which is being showing to the console
rate

216
00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:25,610
which many do I get there it changes the
value but

217
00:12:25,610 --> 00:12:28,949
here it's not even allowing you to
change the value rate so

218
00:12:28,949 --> 00:12:33,779
it is a fun so the the internal
implementation of the way to loot still

219
00:12:33,779 --> 00:12:34,500
remains

220
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:38,510
the same in the case of object of peace
but in the other case I just

221
00:12:38,510 --> 00:12:42,079
get this just change it okay so in a
first at

222
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:45,559
let's come back to we've been talking
about so

223
00:12:45,559 --> 00:12:49,100
with that being said of let's

224
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:52,990
shipped yet again and you know we just
much the Sleepings

225
00:12:52,990 --> 00:12:56,350
and come to a up come to anyone to so

226
00:12:56,350 --> 00:12:59,850
up the principle of one person
JavaScript so it's it's a pretty pretty

227
00:12:59,850 --> 00:13:00,930
fancy name

228
00:13:00,930 --> 00:13:04,230
but most of you we are using this back
and if it does then back into the plain

229
00:13:04,230 --> 00:13:04,689
sight

230
00:13:04,689 --> 00:13:08,500
anyone to say they don't want the Mets
your

231
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:11,819
design and your behavior great soap

232
00:13:11,819 --> 00:13:15,420
not only if you're going to do a a in
hand a no on

233
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:19,630
in lane even-handed are you going to say
but then on to go to a local shop

234
00:13:19,630 --> 00:13:20,439
something like that

235
00:13:20,439 --> 00:13:23,910
up instead he would basically say just
define the

236
00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:28,829
up me presentation and make your
behavior everything inside

237
00:13:28,829 --> 00:13:32,279
up they're just bitches compliment so
you just add event listener

238
00:13:32,279 --> 00:13:35,559
just like this so you have an event
listener on Flickr

239
00:13:35,559 --> 00:13:39,230
which should the snow for you so that a
this

240
00:13:39,230 --> 00:13:42,240
this is a pretty common standard our
design which is being

241
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:46,040
for Justin may order a person for
performance a reason and even the

242
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:46,959
security guys

243
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:50,319
with an issue that because up imagine

244
00:13:50,319 --> 00:13:53,829
one of the four one of the up biggest
problems I mean

245
00:13:53,829 --> 00:13:57,189
a haunting us for the past decade is
crossing scripting rate so

246
00:13:57,189 --> 00:14:00,160
people have been trying to meet again
this in bed as you bring me a straight

247
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:00,959
to bring in

248
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:04,970
different mitigation strategies
including libraries but still

249
00:14:04,970 --> 00:14:08,309
you're opposed to make mistakes so up
this is one of the

250
00:14:08,309 --> 00:14:12,050
design bad as people say just so that
you know you can renew such mistakes

251
00:14:12,050 --> 00:14:15,579
how would you have a completely static
HTML Beach great

252
00:14:15,579 --> 00:14:19,759
and you do we are dynamic data on
JavaScript and you need to make sure you

253
00:14:19,759 --> 00:14:22,319
fill video data only at the Dallas trip
lever

254
00:14:22,319 --> 00:14:25,779
only and plain sight so a so that

255
00:14:25,779 --> 00:14:29,389
all your stuff is being done on your 980
which is that will cause a crisis

256
00:14:29,389 --> 00:14:29,990
gripping

257
00:14:29,990 --> 00:14:33,170
is going to come from and let it suppose
is in process getting by the way

258
00:14:33,170 --> 00:14:36,250
up it's going to come from upscale you
to flip its

259
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:39,639
10 demand letter says he's going to come
from up and up

260
00:14:39,639 --> 00:14:42,689
is going to only come from a it's a
challenge is on the question this in

261
00:14:42,689 --> 00:14:45,089
this case and you can filter all of them
and that Levin

262
00:14:45,089 --> 00:14:49,329
so again if you're going to fall in
security policy

263
00:14:49,329 --> 00:14:53,230
it's it's basically a all of the up
defenseman to patience

264
00:14:53,230 --> 00:14:57,470
defense against cross-site scripting
well-being menus cases of that this

265
00:14:57,470 --> 00:15:01,399
to make sure that you record in such a
way and use these these

266
00:15:01,399 --> 00:15:05,769
up standards of no doing you're a plane
say court so that

267
00:15:05,769 --> 00:15:11,240
your you're less want to cross a creek
and backs

268
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:15,630
and this even suggest you that so
planning document all this because

269
00:15:15,630 --> 00:15:19,670
this principle is something which is
used up you know it you're just going to

270
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:20,319
do it from

271
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:23,549
from a security point of view and that
would cause you problems

272
00:15:23,549 --> 00:15:27,279
up I come to that so now we have object

273
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:30,850
a change in the tradition if you if you
i mean into performance

274
00:15:30,850 --> 00:15:35,130
you may already knowing that you
normally cash in dallas good fight and

275
00:15:35,130 --> 00:15:35,679
name the

276
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:39,579
patient pages long great now it's going
to change it going to cash a haitian

277
00:15:39,579 --> 00:15:40,500
pages

278
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:43,720
and going to you on your javascript
price because they're going to be

279
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:44,889
dynamic depending upon the

280
00:15:44,889 --> 00:15:48,500
kind user are the confession interesting

281
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:52,170
now with that being said if you think
about security

282
00:15:52,170 --> 00:15:55,720
when you put your nine to make for being
sarcastic attack

283
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:59,429
affects so let's stick with the problem
of cross into best for you

284
00:15:59,429 --> 00:16:03,630
today in B minor website using the
principle of an employee JavaScript

285
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:07,589
when this your a CSRF token school

286
00:16:07,589 --> 00:16:12,589
thank you and suppose that Europe's
haitian page is going to be stacked

287
00:16:12,589 --> 00:16:16,699
up it you can actually think up in a few
ace but

288
00:16:16,699 --> 00:16:20,329
up it would naturally going to your
javascript fight because that's where

289
00:16:20,329 --> 00:16:21,919
you're next up pops

290
00:16:21,919 --> 00:16:25,350
up but we'll see how one of the
industry's standard

291
00:16:25,350 --> 00:16:28,760
up based did that so a

292
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:32,740
and you know if your a matter of last
have to see a

293
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:36,350
a unit out of there a job I'll CSRF

294
00:16:36,350 --> 00:16:40,600
guide framework so lot of Joe three
months actually

295
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:44,149
general obligations actually use this
framework because of the simplicity

296
00:16:44,149 --> 00:16:47,540
and its as in the kind of protection
that it gives a

297
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:50,630
so it is one of the libraries which is
completely

298
00:16:50,630 --> 00:16:54,089
a come back to move it depends but my
number is a javascript and just to say

299
00:16:54,089 --> 00:16:55,709
just began

300
00:16:55,709 --> 00:16:59,230
up simply me according is an easy so up

301
00:16:59,230 --> 00:17:02,929
ready to commit opens up just like what
we just saw

302
00:17:02,929 --> 00:17:06,760
so this how their implementation look
like so it would help

303
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:10,470
a script we say if you would not complex

304
00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:14,230
who's trying to use last year's I got
was a good luck on special associate

305
00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:15,329
I've got

306
00:17:15,329 --> 00:17:18,980
and backcourt that's good is going to
launch something like this

307
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:22,380
depending upon the current user so if
you log in as a different session

308
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:26,120
this docking is going to change so you
have a dynamic content

309
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:29,340
getting changed inside a javascript by

310
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:33,149
now if the Armenian to attacking mabus

311
00:17:33,149 --> 00:17:37,040
publications okay I've been thinking
about cross-site Request for you HSS

312
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:37,980
engendered

313
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:41,250
up this this kind of so it's not a look

314
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:44,500
a you you can think that faced this
compact

315
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:48,049
she's the scripts can be on a
cross-domain as well escape from let's

316
00:17:48,049 --> 00:17:48,659
say

317
00:17:48,659 --> 00:17:52,490
CD and art wheeler dot com can be
ordered into your website

318
00:17:52,490 --> 00:17:56,250
say facebook.com just about at some
point but

319
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:59,669
yep so an attacker could basically all
this javascript by

320
00:17:59,669 --> 00:18:03,149
from across the main website same and
I'll call

321
00:18:03,149 --> 00:18:07,240
rate he can be friends the same and a
colleague and a friend something like

322
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:11,020
script SRC political dot com slash CSRF
not slash

323
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:15,950
digest is going to look now

324
00:18:15,950 --> 00:18:20,360
well up and maybe the attack again
hijacked the token and then it's game

325
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:21,389
over Europe

326
00:18:21,389 --> 00:18:24,820
CS out-of-body sorry otis had offered a
chance not anymore because

327
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:28,360
attack and when I really three years he
is out of token which

328
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:32,130
is sworn you used to prevent against the
whole situation great

329
00:18:32,130 --> 00:18:36,320
now the other symbol SSN but I really
thought about this a few years back

330
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:41,230
thank and they say they have a function
inside Angeles comply with shorts

331
00:18:41,230 --> 00:18:45,649
it taste up which has a function but
israeli domain of not my domain and

332
00:18:45,649 --> 00:18:48,730
if it were not gone so the weight loss
is

333
00:18:48,730 --> 00:18:52,059
if you're using this framework for wood
dot com as the domain

334
00:18:52,059 --> 00:18:55,240
then up you have a function which calls

335
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:58,830
up it checks between the coming document
or domain

336
00:18:58,830 --> 00:19:01,850
and your Boondock on which is the
current lets a bitch is trying to

337
00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:03,030
protect

338
00:19:03,030 --> 00:19:08,389
now let's try to get into the East
Valley domain and one place to do

339
00:19:08,389 --> 00:19:12,669
okay so I'll initiate race to check
whether the

340
00:19:12,669 --> 00:19:16,250
got in value is same is is the same as a
bounded

341
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:20,240
which is if if we're not bomb is being
your day if this labor is being ordered

342
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:22,110
my good luck on itself the NEA

343
00:19:22,110 --> 00:19:27,000
return true and that's and that's good
and basically pretends to lift statement

344
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,830
becomes true again and then you know

345
00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:33,280
up main kitchen happens and you're
shares and outlooks

346
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:37,129
know if if it's they have another case
project for some damage

347
00:19:37,129 --> 00:19:40,790
so they have a specific property call
your domain strict

348
00:19:40,790 --> 00:19:44,800
something if you which one you going to
of you can actually know this from some

349
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:45,350
domains

350
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:49,610
so you can try to protect up extort
would not call

351
00:19:49,610 --> 00:19:53,520
might just using this up but may just
learning this from would not call

352
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:57,010
again the picture 8 nope many
interestingly

353
00:19:57,010 --> 00:20:00,820
up when I was trying to actually go deep
into the stack so you had something or

354
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:02,460
just begun don't ensuite

355
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:05,710
of this value so the starting value is
the value of which

356
00:20:05,710 --> 00:20:08,820
up which your a kind website is great

357
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:13,600
soap up madness Returns if I can make
the necessary but don't always true

358
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:17,530
then again it's the same s you know in
the check is my passion it's what

359
00:20:17,530 --> 00:20:21,230
now so because I'm not

360
00:20:21,230 --> 00:20:25,379
en suite is actually a a custom
implementation of new OS

361
00:20:25,379 --> 00:20:29,379
on this which up wish which which is no
mean and make things like

362
00:20:29,379 --> 00:20:32,700
standard for tonight so you can
basically for the day many object in

363
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:34,960
javascript and had an implementation do
it

364
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:38,909
so I may have actually added a ends with
prototype up to a string

365
00:20:38,909 --> 00:20:42,309
which most in the morning day I'm roses
new support so

366
00:20:42,309 --> 00:20:45,740
they just added so that something some
things like a doesn't support it so that

367
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:46,500
it can

368
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:49,919
company we don't great now

369
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:53,090
what they do here is didn't just do a
match and just

370
00:20:53,090 --> 00:20:56,899
me to just known in the nation and what
would this be it's a sneak one is going

371
00:20:56,899 --> 00:20:58,100
to be a bit

372
00:20:58,100 --> 00:21:02,980
now seems to have been trying to low
this from across the main website

373
00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:06,040
an attacker okay on his horn can have

374
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:10,230
his on implementation of stringer
pointed a gun and Smith

375
00:21:10,230 --> 00:21:13,340
if you think about it rate but the
problem is

376
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:16,350
up his quest the Lord first and the up

377
00:21:16,350 --> 00:21:19,710
the CSI got question what second up

378
00:21:19,710 --> 00:21:23,020
again there's another bro if he'll if he
initiates this

379
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:26,220
own definition of ends with up

380
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:29,480
the definition of CSR God is going to
replace it

381
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:32,940
great so next next to me if you cheat
meet me on this had

382
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:35,970
few years back when it implemented but
good

383
00:21:35,970 --> 00:21:39,040
it must confide up me we had

384
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:43,230
a new feature poll object that priest
great so just by adding a new security

385
00:21:43,230 --> 00:21:46,440
feature you actually trying to make
something which used to work

386
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:50,149
me that before so this is the kind of
attack which owns docking whatcha echo

387
00:21:50,149 --> 00:21:52,669
can have something they call when I
don't GS

388
00:21:52,669 --> 00:21:55,740
and he can go and say up

389
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:59,270
standard for the number in Swedish
always going to return true

390
00:21:59,270 --> 00:22:03,540
and you can say all you got free that's
going on for today

391
00:22:03,540 --> 00:22:08,070
and he lost discord and you can go and
see if he leads the squad on the top

392
00:22:08,070 --> 00:22:11,690
and then he traced to load the CS at a
black frame up from the costuming

393
00:22:11,690 --> 00:22:14,159
website which is man don't come by the
way

394
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:17,230
now the ordeal implementation of

395
00:22:17,230 --> 00:22:20,369
up Customs and Border type up many other
is going

396
00:22:20,369 --> 00:22:23,950
is not going to be the place because
intervention and her

397
00:22:23,950 --> 00:22:27,780
because of the object but freeze with
the attack and a it's quite natural

398
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:32,070
up so up man I mean it's pretty
straightforward you just inject your own

399
00:22:32,070 --> 00:22:33,139
farms and

400
00:22:33,139 --> 00:22:36,250
still it open so up as well as or CSI

401
00:22:36,250 --> 00:22:39,909
goes as long as he can train bypass the
up

402
00:22:39,909 --> 00:22:43,220
is latino men shake up you pretty much

403
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:46,559
up secure a pretty much its it's it's
it's gone

404
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:49,980
so their mean also I know eight evidence
of

405
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:53,800
I'll brother demo rating by bus but this
one specifically is interesting because

406
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:54,300
of the

407
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:58,059
up object but Freese a functionality

408
00:22:58,059 --> 00:23:01,240
so it something to fix this great so

409
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:04,950
up so there was a fits a which actually
was

410
00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:09,000
being pushed a into the issues that
about fame ok which uses something on

411
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:09,669
his object but

412
00:23:09,669 --> 00:23:12,909
is frozen okay so

413
00:23:12,909 --> 00:23:16,440
as you can guess object to is frozen is
going to say when I given

414
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:20,720
object is frozen on art and this is a
need to object which is being a new

415
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:21,369
property

416
00:23:21,369 --> 00:23:24,500
which is being given me that much
confined to finish standard okay

417
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:28,190
so it's it's not a pest elimination it
goes according to the stand

418
00:23:28,190 --> 00:23:31,480
so we can check if my object is irony
mean

419
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:34,919
redefined it's being redefined and if
it's frozen underneath then I can know

420
00:23:34,919 --> 00:23:36,830
that someone has tried to change a given
object

421
00:23:36,830 --> 00:23:40,059
just going to put that great

422
00:23:40,059 --> 00:23:43,360
and meet with the pits now

423
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:46,800
the problem is Dallas campus to dynamic
that even you all you've done is frozen

424
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,169
can be spotted

425
00:23:48,169 --> 00:23:51,809
get show up as you can see here

426
00:23:51,809 --> 00:23:55,950
and attacker can always return false but
on you but is frozen

427
00:23:55,950 --> 00:24:01,780
break so up so let's say that we have an
object called

428
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:05,619
string got bored today screen got
prototype is an object here

429
00:24:05,619 --> 00:24:08,730
no lets fans a object but is frozen of

430
00:24:08,730 --> 00:24:13,059
screen a prototype

431
00:24:13,059 --> 00:24:16,799
it's going to wasn't done for us because
no one s great to freeze it

432
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:23,799
it strange reason

433
00:24:24,450 --> 00:24:27,639
K so know if he sailed too but it was
not sitting duck for tonight it's going

434
00:24:27,639 --> 00:24:29,110
to the country because it's me

435
00:24:29,110 --> 00:24:33,679
pre-fight it's me causal okay so we
don't even believe in this chick

436
00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:36,960
unfortunately up it doesn't look that
great so

437
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:40,020
someone can go and say object dart

438
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:47,020
is frozen and redefine the function

439
00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:53,620
okay now I think goes into a pole and us
anything on your disposal of

440
00:24:53,620 --> 00:24:59,350
sorry into it and it floats I'm sorry
because we need to say it's unknown s

441
00:24:59,350 --> 00:25:03,740
fortunate up some is going to sail today
is frozen of

442
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:06,840
this even though it's being frozen
doesn't matter it matter

443
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:10,530
you know I just that promise this is a
very fundamental

444
00:25:10,530 --> 00:25:13,700
up up object a Japanese prison

445
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:16,940
know you you give a sec you'll be
featured try to check it but

446
00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:21,670
I do maybe that can be ordered as let
now I mean that's a problem JavaScript

447
00:25:21,670 --> 00:25:21,950
but

448
00:25:21,950 --> 00:25:25,480
that can be may be used in a lot of
other cases as well for for the good you

449
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:28,030
know if you get you can use this to
conduct a lot of things

450
00:25:28,030 --> 00:25:32,110
you-know-who do some aspect oriented
programming kind of stuff JavaScript but

451
00:25:32,110 --> 00:25:35,110
if you're going to try and do that in
your a

452
00:25:35,110 --> 00:25:38,250
up definition itself like a huge

453
00:25:38,250 --> 00:25:41,700
for for something a security feature is
going to be pretty bad

454
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:46,700
so that's just you know you can do it on
the body is frozen

455
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:49,820
you can redefine its only i think im
just has to and under grace frozen

456
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:53,120
and again it falls on base and the check
is always going to be bypassed and

457
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:56,740
yes 200 orange skin looks okay so

458
00:25:56,740 --> 00:25:59,840
now it's trying to

459
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:05,730
another way of doing a great job up me
just by bus this

460
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:09,040
using up we need to have the ensuite to
work

461
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:12,420
this bike to work for the standby
battery so we need to have

462
00:26:12,420 --> 00:26:16,260
gonna dance with this up to this level
for this to work so that means that

463
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:20,710
enable strict a this has gone is the
party gonna force has always has to

464
00:26:20,710 --> 00:26:21,110
match

465
00:26:21,110 --> 00:26:24,710
if the administrator of the OS is that
got us going to

466
00:26:24,710 --> 00:26:27,780
of then it wouldn't even come to this
condition XO

467
00:26:27,780 --> 00:26:32,080
this might not work always so let's try
and one find a way to convey my budget

468
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:36,240
okay so be initially saw

469
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:39,910
that Mays Landing domain is also
dependent upon the value of not monogamy

470
00:26:39,910 --> 00:26:42,960
okay up so as you can see

471
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:47,030
the whole security check yes as you can
I

472
00:26:47,030 --> 00:26:50,620
we appreciate it only guessing it but up
yep

473
00:26:50,620 --> 00:26:54,870
don't mind on laser a government or
domain is also a late great help you can

474
00:26:54,870 --> 00:26:56,620
read your friend of mine or domain and

475
00:26:56,620 --> 00:27:00,030
you can make them say anything you as
you want rate so set something which

476
00:27:00,030 --> 00:27:00,670
most of

477
00:27:00,670 --> 00:27:03,420
most of us do not believe in the first
place because because I don't wanna know

478
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:04,150
me nasa

479
00:27:04,150 --> 00:27:07,600
security rally which cannot be changed
by 10 wickets and upload a manual blah

480
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:08,000
blah blah

481
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,960
it wouldn't look but you can actually
change on you don't defend prop against

482
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:13,220
a document or domain and

483
00:27:13,220 --> 00:27:16,850
chain stuff just like this so just to
make it go

484
00:27:16,850 --> 00:27:20,270
so he turned off my domain this black
and not com

485
00:27:20,270 --> 00:27:27,270
great I can go and say object are
defined property

486
00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:41,399
minutes just to show up and I just looks

487
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:51,029
let's take it difficult go

488
00:27:51,029 --> 00:27:57,450
poets again

489
00:27:57,450 --> 00:28:04,450
dog if a property document domain yet
can't function return

490
00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:09,260
wheelchair so nice to see a document or
domain

491
00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:14,730
know it's going to be difficult got so

492
00:28:14,730 --> 00:28:18,620
you're actually in the domain of black
and on comp and you're trying to check

493
00:28:18,620 --> 00:28:21,820
what is the value of got my domain and
its the your

494
00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:26,000
owned all is trying to fully great think
about the situations in a lot of this

495
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:26,570
and ideas

496
00:28:26,570 --> 00:28:31,210
you on it your using anodic slavery rate
so if an anti-slavery spank a check

497
00:28:31,210 --> 00:28:35,070
the value of the current domain by using
government or domain the although no

498
00:28:35,070 --> 00:28:38,850
right to for the heretics by doing
something else you can always

499
00:28:38,850 --> 00:28:41,990
Tritons no a famous obtain even going

500
00:28:41,990 --> 00:28:45,700
have your own website and make it more
popular things like that

501
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:49,750
so what does that mean

502
00:28:49,750 --> 00:28:52,960
that means that the same technique can
be used

503
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:57,010
and in snow freezing and going with all
those hard things you can just see all

504
00:28:57,010 --> 00:28:58,980
you can defend prop your feet up with a
domain and

505
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:02,559
10 and the domini want to buy bus and
it's game over

506
00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:08,140
and it's a company may cause of that now
this

507
00:29:08,140 --> 00:29:11,200
this this this is not a problem just
what he is up but

508
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:15,210
know I'd a wasn't a bad idea that they
trade him in there she is out of tokens

509
00:29:15,210 --> 00:29:17,880
in the inside the telescope by which can
be on across the main

510
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:21,970
but I think of this induce may be used
up window.domain every day

511
00:29:21,970 --> 00:29:26,840
just to check 12 kind values right so

512
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:29,900
how do we do with this strike to protect
this that up

513
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:33,100
week I don't make sure that up not

514
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:36,530
embed are High Court your programs
inside a javascript by

515
00:29:36,530 --> 00:29:40,470
okay up it's pretty hard to protect it
as of today

516
00:29:40,470 --> 00:29:44,179
up with the current specifications if
you want to have

517
00:29:44,179 --> 00:29:47,320
in the bank must comply specifications
in the DOM

518
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:50,490
if you want to have a secret precious
something

519
00:29:50,490 --> 00:29:54,559
in your noms and you want to protect it
the only wait for you to protect fish

520
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:58,620
is by not using it at all if if with
them anyway I'm going to use it

521
00:29:58,620 --> 00:30:02,360
then it's going to be some homemade bust
and someone can make make use up

522
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:08,179
great so a you can do something like
most other web sites we get harmed us

523
00:30:08,179 --> 00:30:12,669
know he can you need to have the old web
sites has to my page me non-static

524
00:30:12,669 --> 00:30:16,640
and you know have some to any cannot
catch them and you can have put them in

525
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:17,570
10 your makeup

526
00:30:17,570 --> 00:30:20,620
tax and Grandpa saddam and walked on and
take the stuff

527
00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:24,380
or the best way is to still have a
standard web site

528
00:30:24,380 --> 00:30:27,700
static page and you're jealous grip send
a fetch

529
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:31,010
request a snuff enough hi putting your

530
00:30:31,010 --> 00:30:34,350
c est secret opens just sent in the
request

531
00:30:34,350 --> 00:30:37,550
just make one up a friend request Justin
then one day parts

532
00:30:37,550 --> 00:30:41,260
you can just say no to question which
the up going to open from a different

533
00:30:41,260 --> 00:30:41,630
and

534
00:30:41,630 --> 00:30:45,200
endpoint so that so we try to fix yes I
might as well

535
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:50,090
so from she's out about 3.0 or later
that the point zero or ornaments 0.3 by

536
00:30:50,090 --> 00:30:51,160
one we try to do

537
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:54,669
in such a way that we send a post
request and trying to weaken the second

538
00:30:54,669 --> 00:30:55,100
me

539
00:30:55,100 --> 00:31:00,350
you know just it open and operating in a
meeting with okay

540
00:31:00,350 --> 00:31:04,100
so in any questions so far with the

541
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:07,300
up javascripts a ECMAScript 5 I'm

542
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:14,300
or your Lee if yep

543
00:31:18,050 --> 00:31:24,260
yes yes

544
00:31:24,260 --> 00:31:28,970
I ice all

545
00:31:28,970 --> 00:31:33,150
yet so

546
00:31:33,150 --> 00:31:37,020
here we're not talking a moat across its
crippling okay

547
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:40,360
you're talking about someone is having a
JS JS fight

548
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:43,510
and they're talking with same origin
policy because despite can always been

549
00:31:43,510 --> 00:31:44,350
on a cross-domain

550
00:31:44,350 --> 00:31:47,860
so you and i cant use it to put anywhere
you want

551
00:31:47,860 --> 00:31:52,169
so you you design injection point here
80 you do your

552
00:31:52,169 --> 00:31:56,090
injection scripts you do your up you
know all writing scripts

553
00:31:56,090 --> 00:31:59,100
and then loaded just by up generates

554
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:02,460
it's naturally a bad idea to have
something secret

555
00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:07,179
in a publicly accessible yes by you know
because it can be on across to me

556
00:32:07,179 --> 00:32:10,929
that's obvious and this is kinda for MSN
to the

557
00:32:10,929 --> 00:32:15,390
a JavaScript of hijacking attacks me I
needed for the democrats and we had

558
00:32:15,390 --> 00:32:16,210
previously

559
00:32:16,210 --> 00:32:19,860
if the feet feel good when Jason a
checking before it something similar to

560
00:32:19,860 --> 00:32:20,270
that

561
00:32:20,270 --> 00:32:23,490
but from a different perspective that we
use I'll

562
00:32:23,490 --> 00:32:27,020
musket fire as well you know to coming
to the party and have some fun

563
00:32:27,020 --> 00:32:30,270
get so

564
00:32:30,270 --> 00:32:34,059
okay saddam plumbing up is not a
completely new pink

565
00:32:34,059 --> 00:32:38,380
but and is the you know the last
stopping anyone to talk about today

566
00:32:38,380 --> 00:32:41,909
up yes it's pretty funny as well so up

567
00:32:41,909 --> 00:32:44,909
the having heard this before this has
been being docked the boat

568
00:32:44,909 --> 00:32:47,990
a for quite a while and a few people
even talk about

569
00:32:47,990 --> 00:32:51,750
in Qatar not gonna be nude on probing
techniques to bypass a whole lot of

570
00:32:51,750 --> 00:32:52,270
stuff

571
00:32:52,270 --> 00:32:56,740
so of basically what it means this

572
00:32:56,740 --> 00:33:00,270
no way number loading them into Dom
issue now is to always

573
00:33:00,270 --> 00:33:04,669
handed over to parse okay so a made when
the nasty stuff

574
00:33:04,669 --> 00:33:09,929
which is a you try to populate your job
was completed lose

575
00:33:09,929 --> 00:33:13,130
depending upon what your farm properties
have so

576
00:33:13,130 --> 00:33:16,309
it again have something like form a
musical hello

577
00:33:16,309 --> 00:33:20,530
and you have at and North Pole input
type music on both text and name is

578
00:33:20,530 --> 00:33:21,460
Willard

579
00:33:21,460 --> 00:33:25,040
that in your javascript and linemen if
you go and see how you're not water

580
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:28,140
into actually differential input node so

581
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:32,300
if any notable you you know the stuff
but that's actually pretty nasty that

582
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:35,450
the supposedly churned out you should
not be accessing this is

583
00:33:35,450 --> 00:33:39,140
basically say have an ID are possible
lawmen

584
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:42,649
track prey to reach palm and then try to
take up

585
00:33:42,649 --> 00:33:46,360
thank think that north and then parted
again and take it but rather just have

586
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:50,059
a fall hello Doug Ward a farm named art
up

587
00:33:50,059 --> 00:33:53,350
a a Chinese name we do that so

588
00:33:53,350 --> 00:33:56,750
up that can lead to bring about bringing
back steps so

589
00:33:56,750 --> 00:34:01,200
mainly just the one and only its amber
here of how bad this can be

590
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:05,919
so up you know who to more Dallas
complaint must just before

591
00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:09,560
so does country must disarm justice stir

592
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:13,710
finally let script which is smellin
effective against everything else what

593
00:34:13,710 --> 00:34:14,869
is trying to protect

594
00:34:14,869 --> 00:34:18,369
I would say that donde location is able
to send our location

595
00:34:18,369 --> 00:34:21,419
okay so up when you're trying to iframe
something

596
00:34:21,419 --> 00:34:24,600
for this doesn't pay much to be our DD
tonight just

597
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:27,629
trying to bust out of getting a free

598
00:34:27,629 --> 00:34:31,500
okay if the iframe some x8 and I guess
my apps and then you can have a call

599
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:32,230
like this

600
00:34:32,230 --> 00:34:36,179
Richard must yield offered to say up the
top is the betting window

601
00:34:36,179 --> 00:34:39,470
and then says this your car window if
what I've them doesn't match that means

602
00:34:39,470 --> 00:34:40,409
he i mean

603
00:34:40,409 --> 00:34:43,669
yeah I mean within sight someone and
some other container Bay

604
00:34:43,669 --> 00:34:46,700
attained so that means I need too much
start-up it so he say

605
00:34:46,700 --> 00:34:50,190
don't know the location is able to show
the location now

606
00:34:50,190 --> 00:34:53,760
up this is used to grow and you later
using attacks but people may pass in a

607
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:56,600
lot of maize newsstand my dreams and
watching techniques

608
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:59,740
a you know there's a good night for
going to be a guy I'm not going to talk

609
00:34:59,740 --> 00:35:00,680
about that

610
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:04,180
that itself is funny but up hear
something more funny

611
00:35:04,180 --> 00:35:08,570
so up people who still use the better
way which is extreme options

612
00:35:08,570 --> 00:35:11,609
great to prevent bro to prevent
something from being a friend

613
00:35:11,609 --> 00:35:14,869
use you use a response to call its fame
options

614
00:35:14,869 --> 00:35:18,680
now what can happen here ish up

615
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:22,330
some people try to me know a little bit
more paranoid and they say you know what

616
00:35:22,330 --> 00:35:23,530
I just when used what

617
00:35:23,530 --> 00:35:27,420
because for some time some Bros has been
used to support its been options then

618
00:35:27,420 --> 00:35:30,550
your your stupid free must think what
used to be the second line of defense

619
00:35:30,550 --> 00:35:33,119
which that's what s it's not there

620
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:37,530
rate so the thing is up would you
imagine that you can cause

621
00:35:37,530 --> 00:35:40,540
exorcist whip a frame busting script

622
00:35:40,540 --> 00:35:44,660
so up some some of the best-known we are
you do

623
00:35:44,660 --> 00:35:48,940
up basically up inject ice cream reforms

624
00:35:48,940 --> 00:35:55,430
but not scripts okay up it if if you
want if you have a website is protecting

625
00:35:55,430 --> 00:35:58,460
which is being protected mayor standard
laugh and you have

626
00:35:58,460 --> 00:36:01,730
a a call later this switch is this

627
00:36:01,730 --> 00:36:05,140
and you can basically have cross-site
scripting with it so

628
00:36:05,140 --> 00:36:09,290
when it back again do is have a fall
with the name itself

629
00:36:09,290 --> 00:36:12,470
and location is dallas component a lot
of fun as you know jobs report and I

630
00:36:12,470 --> 00:36:14,530
don't wanna address bar is going to pop
out

631
00:36:14,530 --> 00:36:18,070
JavaScript make so and you just i three
Mik

632
00:36:18,070 --> 00:36:22,589
okay and what happens this if top notch
legal to sell fuel pump that location

633
00:36:22,589 --> 00:36:26,350
will become a central location so
because saddam crumbling

634
00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:29,900
yourself not locations value according
to the JavaScript environment

635
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:34,240
is actually jealous but got a lot of one
just replaced the top don't look at me

636
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:36,010
just be business as the location value

637
00:36:36,010 --> 00:36:39,830
straight pretty interesting so at its
kinda

638
00:36:39,830 --> 00:36:42,950
many her back to see that you can
actually have

639
00:36:42,950 --> 00:36:46,200
a across its good thing just by using

640
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:49,810
up just might bring to defend with some
other core some other

641
00:36:49,810 --> 00:36:53,410
be subject to court so I'll

642
00:36:53,410 --> 00:36:56,740
this is actually part of the work done
by get a case a if

643
00:36:56,740 --> 00:37:00,410
you know if you already know him so he
wasn't on SMS because of the fact that

644
00:37:00,410 --> 00:37:01,190
saddam

645
00:37:01,190 --> 00:37:04,240
known as always gang noms can be public

646
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:07,870
and he'd also what made it so they're
funny techniques about how we can

647
00:37:07,870 --> 00:37:11,440
a you know but the DOM and a lot of
other stuff

648
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:15,589
a another thing which I have mentioned
here s it by the slights but

649
00:37:15,589 --> 00:37:19,330
would like to tell you is you can do and
on coming on a lot of other things as

650
00:37:19,330 --> 00:37:19,640
well

651
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:23,230
like think a board post message: if you
want was measured origin

652
00:37:23,230 --> 00:37:26,400
rate and if you're in a different
above-mentioned was measured in origin

653
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:27,680
all the things I'd like many

654
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:30,800
secure defense Dept in chrome if you
train this

655
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:34,330
if you can trade so than me and a friend
on probing if you can control the name

656
00:37:34,330 --> 00:37:35,640
of the iframe

657
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:40,760
up diminish just the properties in I i
mean i think you can basically

658
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:43,830
change Norway post messages behaving
chrome

659
00:37:43,830 --> 00:37:47,680
so lot of other steps so

660
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:51,350
that being said up code behind on these
kind of things especially things which

661
00:37:51,350 --> 00:37:52,290
we talked about

662
00:37:52,290 --> 00:37:55,620
how did they find that you can document
our domain can be spoofed

663
00:37:55,620 --> 00:38:01,160
a holy God global audit okay so I'll

664
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:04,920
there is something or less object to get
on property descriptor okay

665
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:07,980
so I'm Japan property descriptor is
going to tell you it's I mean at my

666
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:08,640
script by

667
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:11,970
a specification it's going to tell you
what the current objects

668
00:38:11,970 --> 00:38:16,550
up descriptor is like but what's the
point the body what's

669
00:38:16,550 --> 00:38:19,990
was a try to move wasn't being frozen
things like that

670
00:38:19,990 --> 00:38:25,180
so you can find see when the object art

671
00:38:25,180 --> 00:38:29,690
get on property descriptor of let's say

672
00:38:29,690 --> 00:38:33,569
document or domain for instance

673
00:38:33,569 --> 00:38:37,310
they'd and the important thing to note
here is the point the property of that

674
00:38:37,310 --> 00:38:41,430
so a chrome five what's even eighty

675
00:38:41,430 --> 00:38:45,609
price to send this to true it's a tough
fight so the among the many brothers

676
00:38:45,609 --> 00:38:49,280
me somebody sets this before its so that
means

677
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:52,900
anything any property which you think is
sensed you for your

678
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:57,190
program up full-court is going if it's
going to have a bump in the number

679
00:38:57,190 --> 00:39:00,220
up value of through then it's going to
be

680
00:39:00,220 --> 00:39:04,720
when you forget you're not you cannot
believe your own dome for those values

681
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:09,000
pay so back case let's try something
else

682
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:13,850
hollowed location our culture

683
00:39:13,850 --> 00:39:20,850
sorry

684
00:39:22,090 --> 00:39:25,380
so the location I checked the Countryman
use force which means

685
00:39:25,380 --> 00:39:29,130
up you can armies million location on a
chip someone cannot

686
00:39:29,130 --> 00:39:32,930
of that idea of location on a trip and
give it to you up to load

687
00:39:32,930 --> 00:39:36,000
up committees many more very specific

688
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:39,610
a thing just specific goal so-called has
some nice

689
00:39:39,610 --> 00:39:42,420
document on location in all ways in
which gives you different origin

690
00:39:42,420 --> 00:39:43,490
audience so they say

691
00:39:43,490 --> 00:39:46,850
it's it's all there for security reason
rate up

692
00:39:46,850 --> 00:39:50,510
now the continuity of I'll duckman dart
location dart

693
00:39:50,510 --> 00:39:54,360
location dark autogenous group which
means you cannot believe the value of

694
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:55,390
location or guardian

695
00:39:55,390 --> 00:39:59,140
Matt but its the browser windows they

696
00:39:59,140 --> 00:40:03,250
in a just implemented a just there's
practically

697
00:40:03,250 --> 00:40:06,730
I don't know what what's happening we
just I can discuss this in the WBC

698
00:40:06,730 --> 00:40:09,550
mailing list and they had different
different does this have different

699
00:40:09,550 --> 00:40:10,260
philosophies

700
00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:14,170
all but then they should try and protect
this or not because the problem is that

701
00:40:14,170 --> 00:40:16,380
developers are always believing these
values

702
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:19,720
and the process going to go ahead and
just make the point that too many of

703
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:20,680
these two false

704
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:24,550
they just not going to do that so this
hope from the Cape

705
00:40:24,550 --> 00:40:29,230
so can you see that so up all those
things which aren't that great

706
00:40:29,230 --> 00:40:32,910
are can can use both so anything like
portable not host hostname

707
00:40:32,910 --> 00:40:35,690
everything and it's both because you're
not supposed to be there the only thing

708
00:40:35,690 --> 00:40:36,280
which

709
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:39,370
here which you can use to know your
current location is made another

710
00:40:39,370 --> 00:40:40,420
location on tight ship

711
00:40:40,420 --> 00:40:44,020
great not nineties I mean funny up

712
00:40:44,020 --> 00:40:47,850
because up so let's say that but I i ask
you to

713
00:40:47,850 --> 00:40:51,700
I tell you that okay you have a script
and you're going to love this from

714
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:52,690
across the minutes ticked

715
00:40:52,690 --> 00:40:56,580
you need to make sure that you exactly
know what your car and ominous

716
00:40:56,580 --> 00:41:00,350
so you know that you're going to write a
script which has

717
00:41:00,350 --> 00:41:03,850
location or nature than anything else
because I wanted you

718
00:41:03,850 --> 00:41:07,160
you are reading or not Miller domain and
everything else Candice pope now

719
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:10,290
the problem is even if you have that in
mind up

720
00:41:10,290 --> 00:41:13,190
you need to parse it very carefully you
need to go according to the IAEA

721
00:41:13,190 --> 00:41:14,200
specifications

722
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:18,050
need to make sure that because you're
location on a trip is going to get along

723
00:41:18,050 --> 00:41:18,600
the order

724
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:21,730
your everything from ER scheme for the
bar do

725
00:41:21,730 --> 00:41:25,550
up into the hash for the you our
location now into

726
00:41:25,550 --> 00:41:29,260
property bust if you're just going to
make us being match again have

727
00:41:29,260 --> 00:41:33,090
bag that would not be nice to have a
hash up mando comment

728
00:41:33,090 --> 00:41:36,090
de choli so up the Med

729
00:41:36,090 --> 00:41:40,680
and a secure defense new features are
evolving in 08 so that they cannot even

730
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:41,110
go to

731
00:41:41,110 --> 00:41:44,350
many security great show this isn't me
with a temple

732
00:41:44,350 --> 00:41:47,650
and it

733
00:41:47,650 --> 00:41:51,170
and again a if you bring to fuzz
different eight ish new friend

734
00:41:51,170 --> 00:41:55,320
properties in Europe in tests are you
notice that you can do them according

735
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:55,920
using the

736
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:59,050
object art get on property descriptor
and

737
00:41:59,050 --> 00:42:03,760
yeah so again up if these guys talk a
lot about

738
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:06,970
all of this stuffs more than I do
actually so

739
00:42:06,970 --> 00:42:10,350
maybe you'll get a case years to get to
go out based so

740
00:42:10,350 --> 00:42:13,640
you not be watching on this case yet
it's great

741
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:17,960
so up we just day just going to tear
just follow these guys and despite to

742
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:20,470
understand what you're trying to say
you'll actually learn a lot and

743
00:42:20,470 --> 00:42:24,440
do a lot of stuff in it a and yet so

744
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:31,440
these are things I want to check today
any questions okay

745
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:53,540
orbit soap thank you thanks for being
here
