1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:03,870
my name is calm arched this is the talk
on the

2
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:09,580
which applies state action a on a min
try to tell you tell you doing the talk

3
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:10,530
is some also

4
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:13,849
are preliminary adverts of detecting

5
00:00:13,849 --> 00:00:17,350
a which appliance using lab scratch

6
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:21,850
I'm awesome racially mash in some other
technique in general to detect cordial

7
00:00:21,850 --> 00:00:25,920
washing machines this is a joy to work
with Schoening

8
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:29,410
up one for Chile cannot come to
Singapore for

9
00:00:29,410 --> 00:00:36,410
both work and visa issues now I'm in a
star is a quick introduction about us

10
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:41,739
a first again my name is Carly I'm a
college allocator

11
00:00:41,739 --> 00:00:45,440
I work for in Russia Georgia I could be
there

12
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:50,039
and I teach regularly up the computer
security forces

13
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:53,760
I'm also a member of the team dissect

14
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:59,410
I don't know how many you hear place it
yes and a few places chef you might land

15
00:00:59,410 --> 00:01:00,649
into our team

16
00:01:00,649 --> 00:01:04,680
Noah occasionally other play Colgate's
and

17
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:08,049
Afcon and so on %uh that's why me

18
00:01:08,049 --> 00:01:14,409
so show name is a %uh his from industry
he he is a senior security researcher

19
00:01:14,409 --> 00:01:18,960
he has been doing know where analysis
for more than a decade

20
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:22,369
Mike library Cup liberation is sean is
great

21
00:01:22,369 --> 00:01:26,729
in the sense that he did all the hard
work and I come here get the talks

22
00:01:26,729 --> 00:01:30,020
okay anyway let's start

23
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:34,130
so for someone to give a quick
introduction about which lies Ishan

24
00:01:34,130 --> 00:01:37,680
I'm pressure off you know about the list
is this it just for

25
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:41,020
club %uh clarification on the
terminologies

26
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:44,450
so I have a picture here %uh which is a

27
00:01:44,450 --> 00:01:48,970
over simplified portion of which
location I have what I have here

28
00:01:48,970 --> 00:01:52,220
at the very bottom it the physical
change which is a

29
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:56,329
know the silica and all the new Weiss s
K and on top of that

30
00:01:56,329 --> 00:01:59,530
we have this hyper wiser sometime a copy
and then

31
00:01:59,530 --> 00:02:02,790
and then you have the EU which will show
you one her

32
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:07,299
on top it have the gas helping system
and then the applications

33
00:02:07,299 --> 00:02:11,140
I went down to clarify about the hyper
was a partner at that

34
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:14,270
%uh the hypervisor act for comin

35
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:17,849
model no shy start here ako like

36
00:02:17,849 --> 00:02:20,980
can you guys hear me clearly did get

37
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:25,390
sold I'll it in terms of Michael either
late

38
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:29,580
I least she def remote one is sometime
you can have a piece of software

39
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:33,080
running directly on top of this physical
machine

40
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:36,680
and although this a hyper why the
Duchess

41
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:40,440
just manage beyond so this is what I
call the type 1 type elisa

42
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:43,800
you can also have a basically

43
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:47,010
drug welfare system running there then
on top of that

44
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:50,860
Iran a piece of software %uh I guess for
most and the user

45
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:54,680
like for example I ran up the america
you should know my Mac Book

46
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:57,840
thats while the call the types you I'll
hyper white

47
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:02,239
now to make a more concrete you probably

48
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:05,379
are you you know as a user you probably
use one of these

49
00:03:05,379 --> 00:03:08,819
a and I just love have a list of
watchful

50
00:03:08,819 --> 00:03:13,459
more chill I'm ashamed for wider a watch
or ashamed platform provider

51
00:03:13,459 --> 00:03:17,349
I have a list here and including them
there was a box

52
00:03:17,349 --> 00:03:21,150
you gotta you some others I'll

53
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:25,680
one thing I wanna clarified that some
all these land urge

54
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:29,420
they actually produce multiple types of
hypervisors

55
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:33,500
for example then there you have the Mr
yes X

56
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:37,950
which is a type 1 up hypervisor land on
top of its hardware

57
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:41,819
and a man H which machines and

58
00:03:41,819 --> 00:03:45,170
for regular users the at their desktop

59
00:03:45,170 --> 00:03:49,379
likely you're using the other type of
product from the American I like being

60
00:03:49,379 --> 00:03:52,269
there for you shouldn't be in their
player and

61
00:03:52,269 --> 00:03:56,580
solar those are up piece of Iran our top
your

62
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:59,900
in those Linex the you can run a cast
West isn't

63
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:03,000
kept no so far

64
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,819
all the description is about watching
machines and in fact

65
00:04:06,819 --> 00:04:09,879
you know before I came here if the talk
there actually already

66
00:04:09,879 --> 00:04:13,159
people you know me to say are you gonna
talk to watch a machine are you gonna

67
00:04:13,159 --> 00:04:14,900
talk about which appliance

68
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:18,858
so I need to make some clarification
about what is watch appliance

69
00:04:18,859 --> 00:04:24,270
a so I uses picture to show what is
watch appliance

70
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:29,150
are our understanding is at war chill
appliance is actually one special

71
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:33,169
type of what time sheets let me talk to
watch on the changes

72
00:04:33,169 --> 00:04:36,880
but you really just consider me run some
gas offering cistern

73
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:41,400
likely you actually gonna run multiple
applications based in I guess OS

74
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:45,180
you don't really care too much you know
was running their

75
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:48,979
which all appliances are some special
type

76
00:04:48,979 --> 00:04:55,699
of whatcha machines of likely you really
want to run something isolation for

77
00:04:55,699 --> 00:04:56,780
example

78
00:04:56,780 --> 00:05:01,440
Irish if you are doing well our analysis
let's say you have model samples

79
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:06,900
if only want a random in a test on you
don't want to loan also mean 1 p.m.

80
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:10,330
you want a lot one in each in in
individual one

81
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:15,220
I so that you analyze on are still
comply salacious

82
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:18,740
that's one place you once no which
appliance

83
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:22,850
another possibility is that maybe you
have a whole piece of art it's only may

84
00:05:22,850 --> 00:05:25,190
be running only on Windows 95

85
00:05:25,190 --> 00:05:28,280
you are run any other saying on on top
it soap

86
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:31,509
want to apply is are partial cordial
machines that

87
00:05:31,509 --> 00:05:36,600
been tailored sure and specific
applications

88
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:41,400
and this tailoring require maybe some
%ah station in a VM

89
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:44,580
some time now so including the hopping
system modification

90
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:48,020
NeuN application stack for example if
you are

91
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:51,740
doing know our analysis %um I wanted

92
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:55,789
someone doctor does this a commission
that name or when there but the what

93
00:05:55,789 --> 00:05:57,539
they do is they actually lower

94
00:05:57,539 --> 00:06:00,539
the protection level in BB an

95
00:06:00,539 --> 00:06:03,949
so that they actually can see what's
that behavior there

96
00:06:03,949 --> 00:06:08,310
some are some other out which applies
also add also also it

97
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:12,030
kinda function is there any popup they
cannot click it immediately

98
00:06:12,030 --> 00:06:15,229
automatically so those are tight case

99
00:06:15,229 --> 00:06:19,840
a about watch appliance those are the
specially built

100
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:23,940
which omissions now hopefully the Sparta
clear

101
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:27,569
nah let's go to the real questions up go
to that

102
00:06:27,569 --> 00:06:32,340
noted detection about wash appliance and
about you know why want to do this

103
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:39,220
and then you know how to do this so why
do we wanted it at which appliance

104
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:43,210
I want to actually bring up first talk
about the operational worry about why

105
00:06:43,210 --> 00:06:44,810
wanted to tag p.m.

106
00:06:44,810 --> 00:06:48,810
K because wash appliances relate just a
special case of

107
00:06:48,810 --> 00:06:53,430
you know which machine up so their
actually console lurch

108
00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:58,430
on the detection 0 whatcha machines when
Sean and now work on this week initially

109
00:06:58,430 --> 00:07:00,000
which might actually come up

110
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,940
a vessel itself you know all the prior
work may actually put into groups

111
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:08,620
are just so many of the works in the
past at and

112
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:12,240
salt I'm gonna simply pic I why not see
if you can

113
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:16,620
motivation and tell you why people want
to detect the I'm in the past

114
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:20,690
up so this is a 10 the legit reason
people say why

115
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:23,699
a drug dealer user might want to tell up

116
00:07:23,699 --> 00:07:27,430
am i running on me I'm on on running of
is gonna change

117
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:30,630
also in up nowadays like this is

118
00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:34,470
the which'll probably hosting all
whatcha price over so popular

119
00:07:34,470 --> 00:07:37,740
in early de sac know when people rent a
machine

120
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:42,430
they actually have consideration about
whether they want have a Cisco box

121
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:45,810
that a case over or they won't have all
whatcha one

122
00:07:45,810 --> 00:07:48,949
K and the price our difference up but

123
00:07:48,949 --> 00:07:54,690
Tron and the user upon reviewing the you
know get into a machine remotely

124
00:07:54,690 --> 00:07:58,759
he can is it's not all BS lestat

125
00:07:58,759 --> 00:08:02,150
a whether you're running on whatcha
lemme machine out maybe on a

126
00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:06,120
fitzwater all maybe you were starting
with the fiscal on later then migrate

127
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,379
you sure we're chillin

128
00:08:07,379 --> 00:08:10,379
at so that's one other reason people

129
00:08:10,379 --> 00:08:14,479
police a legit reason you know the
end-user want to detect beyond

130
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:18,120
and Adly 10 the on deep in flavor

131
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:22,310
you know i think is still far too they
even have a VM detection

132
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:26,699
suffer toting at so that still all day
but nowadays like

133
00:08:26,699 --> 00:08:29,870
the washing machine actually getting
very powerful

134
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:33,769
Sol relate you know by the church to be
and

135
00:08:33,769 --> 00:08:37,190
worse is a dedicated hosting their
strauss-kahn's the

136
00:08:37,190 --> 00:08:40,269
in beside and its the did

137
00:08:40,269 --> 00:08:43,519
dimana that typo detections Nana hi

138
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:47,700
I'll but there are emerging

139
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:51,720
Nissan thus for example up in the
security area

140
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:55,950
i soo lhasa people heard of the term a
yep no pill

141
00:08:55,950 --> 00:08:59,279
so blow PO is a class at this is
different from the red pill right there

142
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:02,140
was a way to detect the and look you
know it's a

143
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:06,930
concepts such up about it certain type
all know where infection

144
00:09:06,930 --> 00:09:11,490
and that what this snow now or infection
does is in a tournament chain

145
00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:14,790
that no a process in running our fiscal
machine and just

146
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:18,380
No reno brace a layer of a VM

147
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:23,709
and so that whatever detection or
prevention techniques you had in stalin

148
00:09:23,709 --> 00:09:25,110
the OST 4-

149
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:28,730
now is running in the castle s and if
that malicious

150
00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:32,050
other attacker actually controlled and a
niece

151
00:09:32,050 --> 00:09:36,959
be an it's very cell layer Alice not
really noticeable by Danny user

152
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:40,870
then this mill was pretty hard to detect
the case

153
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:45,430
your gas alas activities can be
monitored but on the other hand

154
00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:48,839
if you scanned the castle as you will
not find club on it

155
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:52,899
so that's why I know the legit demand of
detecting

156
00:09:52,899 --> 00:09:57,010
0 whatcha machines in general and all
maybe special type of

157
00:09:57,010 --> 00:10:01,959
which appliance which is on a malicious
I but if you also look from the attacker

158
00:10:01,959 --> 00:10:03,079
point of view

159
00:10:03,079 --> 00:10:07,529
up there's also a huge demand for them
try to YouTube aided detection because

160
00:10:07,529 --> 00:10:11,829
otherwise like far I for example in
every time the crêpe file

161
00:10:11,829 --> 00:10:15,640
aminos actionable on the wire they might
want to rein in a VM

162
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:20,029
they have a specialized fields whatcha
machine and they want to try to analyze

163
00:10:20,029 --> 00:10:20,709
it

164
00:10:20,709 --> 00:10:24,800
so full from the attacker point of view
attacker 12

165
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:29,230
detect whether the code is running in a
VM all special workshop lines

166
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:32,300
if they can find that they can shoes she

167
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:37,329
not due to no exploitation our lease may
be delay it

168
00:10:37,329 --> 00:10:40,440
guess all from debating point view
there's also

169
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:44,540
the motivation of detection which
appliance sheesh

170
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:47,890
now hopefully trust other sis demand of
doing this

171
00:10:47,890 --> 00:10:53,010
now let's go to the real question is how
to detect which appliance

172
00:10:53,010 --> 00:10:58,740
the short answer is: it's really depends
speech type of or shop lines

173
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:02,339
and the case which appliance Selby and

174
00:11:02,339 --> 00:11:06,800
and for those me and that's allow people
to Ryan

175
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:11,579
up to rate for a one or maybe even
access they casoulos kernel level

176
00:11:11,579 --> 00:11:16,160
life actually it's now to your heart if
that's the case for all the workshop

177
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:16,829
lines

178
00:11:16,829 --> 00:11:21,040
I think I don't need to come here if the
talk and images up go to the pool

179
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:25,140
a so because there's really a rich side
of prior works

180
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:28,329
a and you can really

181
00:11:28,329 --> 00:11:32,329
ran some special per one using
instruction like you know

182
00:11:32,329 --> 00:11:36,459
up like not construction look at the
behavior as a literal also

183
00:11:36,459 --> 00:11:42,510
works but for other type a VM for
example the

184
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:45,610
appliance at delay try to tack

185
00:11:45,610 --> 00:11:51,089
the the and really only draw a certain
type of application for example I have a

186
00:11:51,089 --> 00:11:54,100
a fuel a picture here illustrate a

187
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:57,639
Lexus recall I know for which appliance
each of them only Ryan

188
00:11:57,639 --> 00:12:02,620
one type of application K like for
example the first only run IE in it

189
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:05,720
it doesn't run any other application in
our shoot

190
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:09,440
run any detection you would have to

191
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:12,630
you know gave it gave some yeah scratch

192
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:15,690
to let it run or

193
00:12:15,690 --> 00:12:18,920
you my also have a large appliance that
only landed a bit

194
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:22,360
so you can only give Iran a job for
Obama may be up late

195
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:27,250
again and so on PDF this is actually a
%uh certainly a simplified

196
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:31,000
you know case in practice more so the
workshop lines

197
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,350
probably gonna run at startup
application liked if you want to do you

198
00:12:34,350 --> 00:12:35,220
up

199
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:38,630
know our analysis maybe you you know you
have a large appliance

200
00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:42,720
actually Taylor to Landau's I E in a
look at PDF maybe some

201
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:45,820
somewhat office document muffler

202
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:49,149
the simplicial discussion I just assume
you only run one

203
00:12:49,149 --> 00:12:52,420
application K and in all this case

204
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:57,750
now worthless the trouble with you lose
the ability to run our trip for a while

205
00:12:57,750 --> 00:13:01,670
liking of exam be wondering about bill
what doesn't work you need

206
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:05,209
a they don't allow you to run in for a
while

207
00:13:05,209 --> 00:13:08,730
are so program also called the attack
well you can now rent

208
00:13:08,730 --> 00:13:13,510
so you would have felt sick other way to
YouTube you deal with this

209
00:13:13,510 --> 00:13:16,600
and that you know Bay initially saw this

210
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:19,639
you know we can do it at this starts out
pretty hard

211
00:13:19,639 --> 00:13:23,660
s all we only have are some
preliminaries out here

212
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:27,029
and the shunning also have some new
tricks

213
00:13:27,029 --> 00:13:31,230
and unfortunately couldn't have time to
put in a stock so he's also the top

214
00:13:31,230 --> 00:13:32,060
while this

215
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:36,000
up this additional detail in the hacking
Miami in May

216
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,050
K so overall the wanna be fine others

217
00:13:40,050 --> 00:13:43,800
a for some old Abe and

218
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:47,389
it seems like a we could just stood you
some detection

219
00:13:47,389 --> 00:13:51,870
from the applications good level by
using the display property

220
00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:55,000
at by display property I mean that this
plan graphic

221
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:01,380
features and why we're doing this why we
wanted focusing on using this display

222
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:02,860
property to do the

223
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:06,610
which applies detection space I'll these
observations

224
00:14:06,610 --> 00:14:10,139
so first even for the a

225
00:14:10,139 --> 00:14:14,639
wash appliance that only to Alassane but
browser are maybe only run a PDF

226
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:17,660
Raider this to you have to be

227
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:20,990
expose some of the display property to
the VN

228
00:14:20,990 --> 00:14:25,810
kept so always have some display
properly you can potentially touch

229
00:14:25,810 --> 00:14:30,850
and second part in terms of
virtualization

230
00:14:30,850 --> 00:14:36,269
the supporter for words allies in the
display part is actually

231
00:14:36,269 --> 00:14:42,560
know that once so for example you can do
peace Abbas rueful also Tyas looking up

232
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:47,190
he's in a car birch do you need to do
PCR possible for you

233
00:14:47,190 --> 00:14:51,079
which I mean also mention later to doing
it for read it you can do it but you

234
00:14:51,079 --> 00:14:52,540
pretty much a remarkable

235
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:56,389
graphic art and then you do one for a
one for each

236
00:14:56,389 --> 00:15:00,529
p.m. at so that's why we actually try to

237
00:15:00,529 --> 00:15:05,360
take this approach an overall now i'd
basic change the the dough to say

238
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:09,040
amid trying to detect whether no I'm
running for a while

239
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:12,970
mother that's running in up which
appliance or whether it's running on

240
00:15:12,970 --> 00:15:14,180
this has cost

241
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:18,630
I'm good at use a display poverty how
large the display properly you can use

242
00:15:18,630 --> 00:15:23,079
so there's a few simple ones who lives
here and for example the great

243
00:15:23,079 --> 00:15:27,279
tell me one are some old they are no
display screen resolution

244
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:30,699
information and including you know the
size of the

245
00:15:30,699 --> 00:15:34,029
yeah the window and also the refresh
rate

246
00:15:34,029 --> 00:15:37,680
and so on there's also the fishery look
at whether

247
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:41,959
I'll the the p.m. or by the application

248
00:15:41,959 --> 00:15:46,149
scored at once displaying a function
like you know on

249
00:15:46,149 --> 00:15:51,300
HM a fireball web-dl K we also gonna
look at us 3d rendering performance

250
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:52,470
slaughter

251
00:15:52,470 --> 00:15:55,529
application now

252
00:15:55,529 --> 00:15:59,120
starting with a very simple one every
restart first

253
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:02,610
assuming up this is a appliance running
you know

254
00:16:02,610 --> 00:16:06,269
tell tell abortion shame solely on a
simple Tommy

255
00:16:06,269 --> 00:16:11,120
tell a program while this program does
is try to enumerate

256
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:15,769
that all the possible solutions
supported by its a adapter

257
00:16:15,769 --> 00:16:19,529
it turns out JVM act in X hold this

258
00:16:19,529 --> 00:16:23,320
to you the note the water environment
job was supposed to

259
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:27,550
do this protection isolate the physical
information from the

260
00:16:27,550 --> 00:16:31,199
no I played all the job program but it
does actually

261
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:34,759
fascist information from Max alert so it
means like you have a

262
00:16:34,759 --> 00:16:37,980
display I saw her running at the back
and the UN gelatin

263
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:42,519
we'll have to grab all the possible
display supported by the

264
00:16:42,519 --> 00:16:45,750
the lower level host now obsolete don't
plan any

265
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:50,089
axed then are for one look at exception
saying a personal ext

266
00:16:50,089 --> 00:16:53,810
behind so when the Sinnoh any of you

267
00:16:53,810 --> 00:16:58,529
physical machines and also ran albee am
so here just a bushel line

268
00:16:58,529 --> 00:17:02,360
simple you know sample I'll put a couple
things I want to mention

269
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:08,390
first it turns out that for the more the
date display of graphic art

270
00:17:08,390 --> 00:17:12,539
no actual have also says some support
harness all resolutions

271
00:17:12,539 --> 00:17:15,679
eso in its privilege case we have like
38

272
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:19,789
and when I say 38 is like a combination
about the you know that resolution

273
00:17:19,789 --> 00:17:23,189
much up plaster refresh rate so you
might have like

274
00:17:23,189 --> 00:17:26,720
1024 680 and then refresh rates the most

275
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:31,179
56 so times almost and media and each if
any

276
00:17:31,179 --> 00:17:35,010
you know Intel chip nowadays release a
par la so those

277
00:17:35,010 --> 00:17:40,520
but if you look at VMware I'll and which
a box for example which take this to you

278
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:44,840
type to you I wiser and and look at
their number of

279
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:48,289
display supported the nurse horse steel

280
00:17:48,289 --> 00:17:52,390
reason a large number and watch box
actually score for

281
00:17:52,390 --> 00:17:56,610
I'll resolution now certainly all this
number depend on

282
00:17:56,610 --> 00:18:01,610
the where shelf a the software by
running washing up for

283
00:18:01,610 --> 00:18:05,460
a different version of watch a box maybe
you have a slightly different number

284
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:10,039
it it is not that these height elisa can
now support more

285
00:18:10,039 --> 00:18:13,179
k just York's and

286
00:18:13,179 --> 00:18:16,970
so what chu applies eat Tenshi tailored
on any open

287
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:20,720
want to rent Marshall you know instance
seen one so

288
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:24,179
they tend to not implement that many and
plus

289
00:18:24,179 --> 00:18:27,520
if you look at the displayed refresh
rate

290
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:30,750
then there's always running in 64
hearst's and

291
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:34,570
watch box in six years actually also tag
attract

292
00:18:34,570 --> 00:18:39,179
up up we also checked other hyper was
like for example Zane

293
00:18:39,179 --> 00:18:43,870
and like this the another beer number a
sometime your you have just like a

294
00:18:43,870 --> 00:18:46,120
refresh rate as one hurts

295
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:50,460
%uh so the reason again you have all
this is because

296
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:54,010
the developer of all this hype the wiser
need to implement this works for the

297
00:18:54,010 --> 00:18:55,630
exits like this like our

298
00:18:55,630 --> 00:18:59,140
and daily lack of the motivation

299
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:02,620
and also the effort you try to test all
the combination

300
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:05,890
of that display but all the other hand
the fitzco box

301
00:19:05,890 --> 00:19:09,510
you know we have a display card the
lender actually try to make sure

302
00:19:09,510 --> 00:19:12,470
you know you support all kinda
resolution for example today's actually

303
00:19:12,470 --> 00:19:13,630
take take us like

304
00:19:13,630 --> 00:19:17,780
Nov a few minutes actually get the sink
ready because it is really there's also

305
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:19,530
a combination of support

306
00:19:19,530 --> 00:19:22,690
at and then sometime you also see a girl
a beard

307
00:19:22,690 --> 00:19:25,900
you know display a the screen resolution
like

308
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:30,600
for example we saw be on there national
supporters 10:41 by 10:41

309
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:34,679
this is Alice Alice to our knowledge
this the pretty rare

310
00:19:34,679 --> 00:19:38,530
because in the regular physical display
be you really have

311
00:19:38,530 --> 00:19:41,610
at least the the screen resolution is a

312
00:19:41,610 --> 00:19:44,730
the only other even number not even

313
00:19:44,730 --> 00:19:48,419
on number if someone know why this
happened let us know

314
00:19:48,419 --> 00:19:52,960
so this is at dumb examples are to use

315
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:58,640
Jolla USA no while the wifi you I'm
having which applies not even runs lol

316
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:02,039
the again there are other interface for
example this

317
00:20:02,039 --> 00:20:05,659
hear what I show is that you can
actually use JavaScript

318
00:20:05,659 --> 00:20:10,450
a up the actually this is the Adobe
JavaScript API

319
00:20:10,450 --> 00:20:14,480
and the explore Las informational about
this place

320
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:19,260
you my saw that you know for Adobe you
only need to know the kinda been though

321
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:23,299
and that's the you know the the
application size but it turns out

322
00:20:23,299 --> 00:20:26,659
this API allow you should get all the
possible

323
00:20:26,659 --> 00:20:30,909
display you know the resolution behind
so there's a

324
00:20:30,909 --> 00:20:34,429
this mantra masur for example you can
get the primary display

325
00:20:34,429 --> 00:20:37,460
which is actually is the supposedly the
whole

326
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:40,549
the host a desktop resolution and

327
00:20:40,549 --> 00:20:44,169
and there you can get the size and there
are

328
00:20:44,169 --> 00:20:48,140
actual loss more information on you know
you can grab from this

329
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:51,200
and house late you know you can text
rightish

330
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:54,840
you sales information if you're out so
those are just some

331
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:57,980
very simple in a preliminary offer which
wire is a

332
00:20:57,980 --> 00:21:02,070
screen resolution at another thing which
white

333
00:21:02,070 --> 00:21:05,539
is simply try to see ish but the

334
00:21:05,539 --> 00:21:09,850
application they tryna say a browser by
their support certain factions now

335
00:21:09,850 --> 00:21:14,669
up this is a came as a surprise to us
favorite in expect this but are sought

336
00:21:14,669 --> 00:21:17,720
up law so the browser

337
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:20,789
in our to support the at once

338
00:21:20,789 --> 00:21:24,240
display feature like you HTML file
especially bob tail

339
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:27,270
they need to talk to the driver

340
00:21:27,270 --> 00:21:30,830
and the again the physical

341
00:21:30,830 --> 00:21:34,730
display a chip minders like you know a
media Intel

342
00:21:34,730 --> 00:21:38,830
they actually make sure they're dry
rates like with all the browser Vale

343
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:42,110
but if you try for exam in this case

344
00:21:42,110 --> 00:21:45,419
%uh like for Fox 27 points or 0.1

345
00:21:45,419 --> 00:21:50,140
payment made run on Windows at it works
it's a poor

346
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:54,169
you know about it by Geo but if you take
the same offering system

347
00:21:54,169 --> 00:21:57,470
same portion of the the Firefox

348
00:21:57,470 --> 00:22:01,840
brother put in oven be in there put into
what a box

349
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:05,030
just no complaints a you know they don't
support

350
00:22:05,030 --> 00:22:08,350
not to yell something wrong text me
here's actually a screenshot by

351
00:22:08,350 --> 00:22:11,530
so if you run down the host it

352
00:22:11,530 --> 00:22:14,960
actually said said elsa poor but the
same worsen

353
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:18,010
if you're an on the p.m.

354
00:22:18,010 --> 00:22:21,100
doesn't work so no way like this is like
again a dummy

355
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:24,860
your stay you can use yeah in case
things to happen

356
00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:29,780
and you can write a script and try to
graphics exception if you got exception

357
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:33,090
something wrong I'm so the

358
00:22:33,090 --> 00:22:37,400
terse all that may try IEEE on the other
hand

359
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:40,500
you put in a Wii and I actually works it

360
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:43,659
I he actually have a or so my I'll

361
00:22:43,659 --> 00:22:47,919
a hypothesis is that when the p.m. era
which a lot too late

362
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:53,460
you develop their driver to support
additional 50 and live jail they work on

363
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:55,890
IE that make it work but they didn't
test on

364
00:22:55,890 --> 00:23:01,080
are Fox I'll so the largest again
additional information you can use

365
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:06,080
now always late when you use this type
of behavior

366
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:10,190
it doesn't relate country to tell you

367
00:23:10,190 --> 00:23:15,950
for you Center program to the other side
and rain in the machine and come back

368
00:23:15,950 --> 00:23:22,950
if let's say you got exception say know
about jail supported

369
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:26,870
if you use ads not just use that shit
say I'm gonna

370
00:23:26,870 --> 00:23:30,750
user to detect whether it's a VM a
official plans are not

371
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:34,070
up you gonna have some false positive

372
00:23:34,070 --> 00:23:38,000
K so they're lost a race in back
actually

373
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:42,409
the a machine a physical machine my
action not even spar mucho

374
00:23:42,409 --> 00:23:45,730
so one possibility is you know you might
have a you know

375
00:23:45,730 --> 00:23:49,880
appears dislike are typically not you
know supported all you know how old

376
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:50,610
device

377
00:23:50,610 --> 00:23:55,230
doesn't support and a you could you
could also have someone to steal

378
00:23:55,230 --> 00:23:58,250
unload the driver wants the youth are on
display driver

379
00:23:58,250 --> 00:24:02,169
at so you could help false-positive so
in a case

380
00:24:02,169 --> 00:24:07,150
if you want to use still early on the
your sake I mention it to do right now

381
00:24:07,150 --> 00:24:10,529
why skill merriman no se ha ha many
people are using

382
00:24:10,529 --> 00:24:13,940
applying this work supplies detection
are

383
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:18,590
that not gonna have a very accurate is
up hired this thing is to use for in the

384
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:20,110
sense that if you have a

385
00:24:20,110 --> 00:24:23,440
relatively targeted attack you know
someone

386
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:27,760
you know it's using probably like you
know state alarm chain

387
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:31,909
at then the Senate some script there

388
00:24:31,909 --> 00:24:35,010
your water bottle in the middle and
maybe device

389
00:24:35,010 --> 00:24:38,140
at analyze your program then that

390
00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:41,779
an hour my work kept so anyway so that's
just seconds narrow

391
00:24:41,779 --> 00:24:45,529
a small one these sir now for free

392
00:24:45,529 --> 00:24:49,510
you know the players is looking at the
performance aspect

393
00:24:49,510 --> 00:24:53,429
of the a graphic display else through
the

394
00:24:53,429 --> 00:24:58,400
you about script I'll the reason we do
this is space on these

395
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:01,909
observations so first small sweetie

396
00:25:01,909 --> 00:25:05,630
3d graphic displaced do you often
require you know

397
00:25:05,630 --> 00:25:08,890
loss a holler sports

398
00:25:08,890 --> 00:25:13,150
will the were to apply intellectual
mission platform we have right now

399
00:25:13,150 --> 00:25:16,270
they all have this same costs read the
at our

400
00:25:16,270 --> 00:25:20,740
so that supposed to help you to makes
the around rendering the 3d object

401
00:25:20,740 --> 00:25:21,730
sasser

402
00:25:21,730 --> 00:25:25,799
but it actually stealing a base our
result I wish I

403
00:25:25,799 --> 00:25:31,299
will show you some sample honor Steve
falling behind worse is the fits one

404
00:25:31,299 --> 00:25:34,590
sir case for the

405
00:25:34,590 --> 00:25:39,000
Nick women's that use March values which
applies to the TAC

406
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:43,500
malicious activities often they'd run
marked for instance a large appliance

407
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:46,740
Sol darlie they are

408
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:50,289
you know and you see hardware support to
you know

409
00:25:50,289 --> 00:25:54,770
increase to accelerate the graphic
display performance

410
00:25:54,770 --> 00:25:59,919
so-called operations now for people like
you know people like me

411
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:03,150
I know this idolizes audiences so yum

412
00:26:03,150 --> 00:26:07,909
00 people like me Israel may be asked to
say why did you know to you even want to

413
00:26:07,909 --> 00:26:09,760
run 3d in the

414
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:13,940
on the lab script by Danny self raise a
red flag

415
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:17,400
all returns are the trend it that's how

416
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:21,700
people are I know really building loss
of gain

417
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:26,029
activities in it's him off I'll really
in the lab so

418
00:26:26,029 --> 00:26:29,690
here for example is quick sorry in my
jail

419
00:26:29,690 --> 00:26:33,140
I A only know this once I

420
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:36,750
start looking at this word and I i you
know play bits

421
00:26:36,750 --> 00:26:40,120
it's actually runs very small slave EE

422
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:44,850
you know running on running the browser
on a physical machine

423
00:26:44,850 --> 00:26:48,570
so there's also gain and other activity

424
00:26:48,570 --> 00:26:51,710
are using but was graphic rendering

425
00:26:51,710 --> 00:26:55,169
and in a in a brother set up

426
00:26:55,169 --> 00:26:58,799
now one we did it like again the you
know I

427
00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:02,840
do some simple test just ran the same
quick spray

428
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:07,659
no gain we look at a yeah frame raced
hot ass you can render

429
00:27:07,659 --> 00:27:11,770
the the 3d display attorneys are like on
the

430
00:27:11,770 --> 00:27:15,260
this is I believe if I remember this
correctly this a dollar and media

431
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:19,059
a chip but if you are right running on
Intel

432
00:27:19,059 --> 00:27:24,500
1s also pretty no similar the host can
render an exception if I for any per

433
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:25,640
second for the quakes

434
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:29,289
sry if you run in a VM even let saddam
missed

435
00:27:29,289 --> 00:27:33,320
you know not too bad days like this new
playable like is like 25

436
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:36,399
a and the amid

437
00:27:36,399 --> 00:27:40,700
if year and model instant to this
obsolete no things going to slaughter

438
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:45,669
and the other way to test this need
relation to stress the

439
00:27:45,669 --> 00:27:51,220
3d display is that you can try to let it
render March ball text because

440
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:54,419
sometimes haha who are the day support

441
00:27:54,419 --> 00:27:57,789
Chace our support once graphics
rendering

442
00:27:57,789 --> 00:28:01,200
all they do is they can relate our
losses thanks

443
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:04,679
which is harder in a full-featured oops
audience offer

444
00:28:04,679 --> 00:28:08,649
ca so they also tried it s like how many
steals 3d object

445
00:28:08,649 --> 00:28:13,100
you can add on like in a particular
script and making basing our script we

446
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:14,770
can select five thousand

447
00:28:14,770 --> 00:28:17,860
up 3d object rendering and the kids to
keep likes

448
00:28:17,860 --> 00:28:21,830
ne 15th frame per second if you either
keep the first time frame per second

449
00:28:21,830 --> 00:28:25,120
like the am really been stressed yeah up

450
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:29,539
how to use this information again like
we have all this number party he said

451
00:28:29,539 --> 00:28:33,399
so we came is this you know strategy
like basically what I'm gonna do this

452
00:28:33,399 --> 00:28:36,500
gonna write a script up that

453
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:40,830
dynamically up probably next nationally
increase the number of 3-d object want

454
00:28:40,830 --> 00:28:41,610
to render

455
00:28:41,610 --> 00:28:45,620
and there are two check hollered as the
host

456
00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:50,820
you know how does the other side
response in terms the frame rate

457
00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:55,039
now issue have up the other side report
back to say

458
00:28:55,039 --> 00:28:59,610
they can support you know if you saw
wasn't 3d object has to keep like 30

459
00:28:59,610 --> 00:29:01,820
frames per second

460
00:29:01,820 --> 00:29:05,659
become prey sure that now that is

461
00:29:05,659 --> 00:29:10,120
host machine a physical host running all
this

462
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:13,360
again let me repeat what i'm saying is
if they gave me

463
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:17,270
if the script report back a high-eight
frame rate

464
00:29:17,270 --> 00:29:22,590
mass loss object I she'll I'm positive
the other side in special box

465
00:29:22,590 --> 00:29:26,059
and plus you can't disguise all this
state action

466
00:29:26,059 --> 00:29:30,580
using a gain it's the other side can now
simply say you're actually running lots

467
00:29:30,580 --> 00:29:31,539
of Dec 10

468
00:29:31,539 --> 00:29:35,590
this must be malicious are you can this
guy that in a gay

469
00:29:35,590 --> 00:29:40,029
now ha over make sure and this and that
I'm not saying that if I get a small

470
00:29:40,029 --> 00:29:40,970
number

471
00:29:40,970 --> 00:29:45,140
he's our number object all all frame
rates our say that sell large appliance

472
00:29:45,140 --> 00:29:49,220
I can now say that because obviously no
sauce all

473
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:52,659
false-positive possible and that his
first

474
00:29:52,659 --> 00:29:55,850
you can have us really slow machine
makes you know are

475
00:29:55,850 --> 00:29:59,419
my parents promise to YouTube re all PC

476
00:29:59,419 --> 00:30:03,320
and and I actually tried to this tour
and the same scraps

477
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:07,169
on the and from box which is known as
slow

478
00:30:07,169 --> 00:30:10,990
and miss last graphics or and so

479
00:30:10,990 --> 00:30:15,370
I collect no five-and-a-half tax retail
project with fifteen frames per second

480
00:30:15,370 --> 00:30:19,779
are such a liar like a cock on up like a
awesome song

481
00:30:19,779 --> 00:30:23,510
topless you can get 500 object that's
thirty

482
00:30:23,510 --> 00:30:26,779
frame per second so again implication

483
00:30:26,779 --> 00:30:31,210
for the detection you can use this
technique to you

484
00:30:31,210 --> 00:30:36,020
try to convince you that the other side
is more like likely a physical box

485
00:30:36,020 --> 00:30:40,370
but third reversal the same is not true
like ish

486
00:30:40,370 --> 00:30:43,799
it didn't meet at you will have to make
decisions

487
00:30:43,799 --> 00:30:47,809
again how would this be useful

488
00:30:47,809 --> 00:30:51,630
depend on situation if you are its
attack is targeting some

489
00:30:51,630 --> 00:30:56,510
you know business some CEO and likely
basically use apart from saying

490
00:30:56,510 --> 00:30:59,590
you know regardless know whether its
work needed on out

491
00:30:59,590 --> 00:31:04,200
up and this might be useful but if you
again try to do a brawl study

492
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:07,669
you'll have to yeah do more

493
00:31:07,669 --> 00:31:11,750
at use other tricks so we should be
trying to do more effort around us as a

494
00:31:11,750 --> 00:31:12,860
nation that

495
00:31:12,860 --> 00:31:17,640
a shining gonna do I another Tosh miss
ex anymore technique

496
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:20,820
so far all I can say is we're still
working on its but

497
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:24,380
it's not a great completely hopeless so
I actually move onto

498
00:31:24,380 --> 00:31:27,679
make more assumption about what
potentially

499
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:33,230
could happen I so latest how can we get
more information about that

500
00:31:33,230 --> 00:31:37,140
remote machine so that we can make
better judgment

501
00:31:37,140 --> 00:31:40,690
so here I would have to make some
assumptions to say okay

502
00:31:40,690 --> 00:31:46,720
one ish they can gather some script to
Ryan close to native call

503
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:50,130
and example uses ex-lax K

504
00:31:50,130 --> 00:31:55,769
al I know a lot to say hey no hole with
now they still want to run ActiveX

505
00:31:55,769 --> 00:31:59,519
and in homes steeply enable that

506
00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:03,490
and you actually actually right nurse
I'm at least I don't see there's a good

507
00:32:03,490 --> 00:32:04,640
reason to do some

508
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:08,409
heimer again think about if we are
talking about the invading the

509
00:32:08,409 --> 00:32:11,820
detection I'll for some box

510
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:16,500
in the mid alt you doing using which
aligns to analyze the program

511
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:21,429
and as as far as me know that you know
they actually did loss of words to you

512
00:32:21,429 --> 00:32:24,820
you know for slower today level
protection so the actual run

513
00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:28,720
lotto and trust called second also
enable this also click

514
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:31,820
care you know sometime drug user

515
00:32:31,820 --> 00:32:35,450
and nowadays the the warning is so good
the

516
00:32:35,450 --> 00:32:39,309
no relation say ran this a but

517
00:32:39,309 --> 00:32:42,440
in the wash hope once they my rent so
those are

518
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:46,090
the assumption made to try to say okay
if

519
00:32:46,090 --> 00:32:49,610
you actually have which applies doubt
that

520
00:32:49,610 --> 00:32:53,190
then things get washita and for people
that know I to axe

521
00:32:53,190 --> 00:32:57,080
it's actually raining native cold you
have a compound object

522
00:32:57,080 --> 00:33:00,549
access exco and rent at

523
00:33:00,549 --> 00:33:03,570
no you can do a lot of

524
00:33:03,570 --> 00:33:06,720
saying 1c have the other side randa's

525
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:10,169
actual attacks are network of but
actually true said

526
00:33:10,169 --> 00:33:14,870
do something very simple up so we look
around and see if I know that

527
00:33:14,870 --> 00:33:18,480
attorneys are Microsoft supporters
stoller and my knee

528
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:22,419
is first this car mismanagement
instruments

529
00:33:22,419 --> 00:33:26,029
and in particular this one object Roop
and

530
00:33:26,029 --> 00:33:29,110
as called by bass enterprise management

531
00:33:29,110 --> 00:33:32,460
hell are you you know I she get the
permission

532
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:36,480
it will allow you to grapple also detail
information about that post

533
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:40,470
obviously you know she Nall more about
that fact there are lots of other

534
00:33:40,470 --> 00:33:42,740
exportation you can do but yeah on

535
00:33:42,740 --> 00:33:45,840
stare the simple site Sol years

536
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:49,399
one scott free don't to do with this

537
00:33:49,399 --> 00:33:53,850
and this is basic latest no a newer BB
am

538
00:33:53,850 --> 00:33:57,330
missed object and then from there

539
00:33:57,330 --> 00:34:02,260
you can actually do acquire it is a any
information about this Toya sorry about

540
00:34:02,260 --> 00:34:02,510
the

541
00:34:02,510 --> 00:34:05,519
you know and a niece you know OS and how
it

542
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:08,800
view of other the system K

543
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:12,550
so did now I wanna show you part part of
the script but

544
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:15,649
that's probably the most important parts
initiate man you can

545
00:34:15,649 --> 00:34:19,089
basie numerous other item now here's one
thing

546
00:34:19,089 --> 00:34:23,480
wanna some Paul put from are are sore
site this is basically Heather

547
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:26,510
tracks in bed in a in a lot

548
00:34:26,510 --> 00:34:30,720
page then be sent to the remote side and
if the rennet

549
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:35,070
the label to grout loss information for
example he rich can see that

550
00:34:35,070 --> 00:34:39,520
I have this issue I D E beacon know what
the title poor they are

551
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:43,810
you know and then you know all other you
information the graphic display

552
00:34:43,810 --> 00:34:44,909
information

553
00:34:44,909 --> 00:34:49,270
now if for I ever for anyone that
actually look at

554
00:34:49,270 --> 00:34:52,960
the other which all Jane platform

555
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:57,510
if you look at all the the twice the
support not things are obviously you'd

556
00:34:57,510 --> 00:34:58,760
really like the plot

557
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:02,760
and others this is like if you can run a
program

558
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:06,490
on the command line SH like are starting
from nation likes

559
00:35:06,490 --> 00:35:10,060
you know the processor is actually you
know at war show

560
00:35:10,060 --> 00:35:13,650
which'll watch box screen there the the
poorest

561
00:35:13,650 --> 00:35:18,609
made by our goal Sol all this
information are obvious you can grab

562
00:35:18,609 --> 00:35:22,329
and there's more information for example
you can also look at

563
00:35:22,329 --> 00:35:26,000
deweiss holiday map how their memory
mapped to the

564
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:29,930
their other OS and like ladies

565
00:35:29,930 --> 00:35:33,040
there were chill the washing machine
they would do that

566
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:36,250
you know the same type of mapping
regardless or

567
00:35:36,250 --> 00:35:40,390
which and where you run this if you look
at the physical box

568
00:35:40,390 --> 00:35:43,970
usual fit a box can have really dramatic
different

569
00:35:43,970 --> 00:35:47,589
after all this device mapping address
sold so

570
00:35:47,589 --> 00:35:52,170
basically even the which applies you can
hide all the strange saying I'm not

571
00:35:52,170 --> 00:35:52,560
gonna

572
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:55,820
say or chill box in anywhere

573
00:35:55,820 --> 00:36:00,890
bed the behavior of that the memory
mapping they can steam on if I have it

574
00:36:00,890 --> 00:36:03,440
takes loss I for for them to cost minus

575
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:06,680
kept now contrary to that

576
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:10,400
here's the output: you know if you run
this all you know one of the host your

577
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:11,510
see only show you

578
00:36:11,510 --> 00:36:15,020
part of the the all put this is so

579
00:36:15,020 --> 00:36:19,619
one whom she may have a say in 2001 and
I only show you a partial a UHaul put

580
00:36:19,619 --> 00:36:20,920
about the

581
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:26,190
that ttyS in memory mapping this truly
are not much longer list

582
00:36:26,190 --> 00:36:29,540
much research that i've deweiss and

583
00:36:29,540 --> 00:36:33,950
warped a colossal after four though
where to apply it so what which machine

584
00:36:33,950 --> 00:36:34,500
minder

585
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:39,060
socially many this as a %uh Realty waste

586
00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:42,339
now as a measure early like what if the

587
00:36:42,339 --> 00:36:46,530
although whatcha Michelle which
appliance I they try to destroy D

588
00:36:46,530 --> 00:36:49,849
hide all this information they can
choose to say

589
00:36:49,849 --> 00:36:53,160
inside no lo the washoe

590
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:56,690
watch a box display driver how far less
load the

591
00:36:56,690 --> 00:37:01,619
a media one well that Dad naive approach
doesn't work because

592
00:37:01,619 --> 00:37:05,839
and if you lower the immediate driver
and the media driver gonna say no

593
00:37:05,839 --> 00:37:10,349
in gonna need to access a the Weiss
deweiss actually is built by let's say

594
00:37:10,349 --> 00:37:11,720
what a box

595
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:14,849
then the driver failed to load so

596
00:37:14,849 --> 00:37:19,829
it's not easy for them to lie about it
there is alternative

597
00:37:19,829 --> 00:37:25,010
the washing machine oh which applies a
lender they can actually try to mimic

598
00:37:25,010 --> 00:37:28,910
like be loaded watch otherwise that it
completely

599
00:37:28,910 --> 00:37:33,210
you know behave the same as less a
popular graphic

600
00:37:33,210 --> 00:37:36,579
car so nasa

601
00:37:36,579 --> 00:37:40,050
possible approach and in that case

602
00:37:40,050 --> 00:37:44,160
make energy use the media driver and
then the list although the widest

603
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:47,800
at least on the display part it's you
know we don't have Alistair

604
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:52,250
you know which box information there's
you know easy to grab that

605
00:37:52,250 --> 00:37:56,270
however this is pretty hard work

606
00:37:56,270 --> 00:37:59,710
at first you know as far as we know that
I really

607
00:37:59,710 --> 00:38:03,270
now home be don't see any

608
00:38:03,270 --> 00:38:06,410
implementation of or chill display car

609
00:38:06,410 --> 00:38:10,750
a map to the latest are that more than
was it

610
00:38:10,750 --> 00:38:14,869
I don't have any what should deweiss
implantation for display car for more

611
00:38:14,869 --> 00:38:15,780
than display at

612
00:38:15,780 --> 00:38:19,869
twice up if you look for like six exam
QEMU

613
00:38:19,869 --> 00:38:22,869
are maybe %um there watch box you can
find some

614
00:38:22,869 --> 00:38:26,950
old VGA deweiss I think Firstsource
logic

615
00:38:26,950 --> 00:38:30,570
is one of them this is true really
really old

616
00:38:30,570 --> 00:38:34,020
display deweiss at but all

617
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:36,930
you know what i'm saying you with all
this doesn't mean that they cannot be

618
00:38:36,930 --> 00:38:37,260
loaded

619
00:38:37,260 --> 00:38:40,780
they can stupid because if you look at
while our

620
00:38:40,780 --> 00:38:44,099
other deweiss the deal they actually if
you open up

621
00:38:44,099 --> 00:38:47,790
you know which one with box are we on
their national Rd many

622
00:38:47,790 --> 00:38:52,260
other device by so for example the neck
were popular one at that

623
00:38:52,260 --> 00:38:56,430
the Intel you once all since at there
are

624
00:38:56,430 --> 00:39:01,570
lb random watch a box your mission
doesn't have to have when tell you one

625
00:39:01,570 --> 00:39:02,220
thousand

626
00:39:02,220 --> 00:39:05,380
I'll likes to run watch box bogey

627
00:39:05,380 --> 00:39:08,670
no in watch box mimic that a so

628
00:39:08,670 --> 00:39:13,040
their spa so do I think Andy s'all I'm
not saying they can all

629
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:18,700
implement and one really makes a Intel
display are no immediate display oliver

630
00:39:18,700 --> 00:39:22,550
high over it's really difficult

631
00:39:22,550 --> 00:39:26,150
I i can. no claim that it's really
really difficult for them to make sure

632
00:39:26,150 --> 00:39:28,220
that the Weiss behave the same

633
00:39:28,220 --> 00:39:31,680
as the physical one and

634
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:35,329
since there's no one to implement the
wacho

635
00:39:35,329 --> 00:39:39,589
you know a good wash or displayed
deweiss I gave the example

636
00:39:39,589 --> 00:39:43,339
from our prior work looking at the
network with washable

637
00:39:43,339 --> 00:39:47,060
deweiss forces go to waste so here's
example

638
00:39:47,060 --> 00:39:51,460
I'll look at the or chill implementation
of foreign tell you once awesome

639
00:39:51,460 --> 00:39:55,320
and we compared the real deal ice you'll
also be hey there difference

640
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:58,500
I'm I'm so is this a one sample we v

641
00:39:58,500 --> 00:40:02,890
look at the space on the QEMU
incantation and for example EV do a ride

642
00:40:02,890 --> 00:40:04,040
to this ICS

643
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:08,349
this which is a in trop car satin
register

644
00:40:08,349 --> 00:40:12,220
the to you the physical and which lacks
a behave differently

645
00:40:12,220 --> 00:40:15,380
J there's another one this is about the
idea control

646
00:40:15,380 --> 00:40:19,980
now you gave a value its again have
different behavior

647
00:40:19,980 --> 00:40:23,720
the pony that when you implement this
work to do is:

648
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:26,740
especially the complex deweiss

649
00:40:26,740 --> 00:40:31,660
is it's so hard to make them really
behave the same ol the corner cases

650
00:40:31,660 --> 00:40:35,119
and they have a like are last year have
a black hat talk are

651
00:40:35,119 --> 00:40:38,680
I exactly to topic how to find the
difference between those

652
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:42,890
some can refer you to that now you must
do say okay Wallisch

653
00:40:42,890 --> 00:40:47,030
be just use a role twice less how about
we do peace Abbas

654
00:40:47,030 --> 00:40:50,050
get P surpass allies and nation before

655
00:40:50,050 --> 00:40:53,200
up is popular for some other deweiss

656
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:56,329
but so far not yet ready you know

657
00:40:56,329 --> 00:40:59,770
for display but general concept is a

658
00:40:59,770 --> 00:41:04,540
in stonov email addy slack a show on the
right hand side

659
00:41:04,540 --> 00:41:07,750
you know you how the physically wise and
later in lady Weiss

660
00:41:07,750 --> 00:41:11,280
PCI passthrough basically you know so
the hypervisor

661
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:14,800
explosive device directly to the which
outlines

662
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:19,720
so if you wanted test to say this to a
rodeo I saw not it's the post behave are

663
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:20,950
the same like

664
00:41:20,950 --> 00:41:25,300
that fits one because it is a real one
hardware

665
00:41:25,300 --> 00:41:28,690
are based on our current our knowledge
so for sis

666
00:41:28,690 --> 00:41:31,740
no practical product we can access

667
00:41:31,740 --> 00:41:36,730
there are some a a media has the up
product announcement caught up

668
00:41:36,730 --> 00:41:39,910
there's as to why Scott great k2

669
00:41:39,910 --> 00:41:43,910
supposedly this is all one graphic art
if this clip locking

670
00:41:43,910 --> 00:41:47,920
then they can big expose multiple no

671
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:51,040
piece I pass a law in graphic arts a
model via

672
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:55,730
K and so far we have no access that but
even date may doubtless a

673
00:41:55,730 --> 00:41:58,890
it works perfectly and bass are

674
00:41:58,890 --> 00:42:02,030
past experience with the Intel network
are

675
00:42:02,030 --> 00:42:06,040
as a Intel 10 gigabit and fortieth

676
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:10,609
which is coming up they actually have
different driver for the one that

677
00:42:10,609 --> 00:42:14,650
running on the house one and the one
running on the be online the whole slice

678
00:42:14,650 --> 00:42:15,960
call PF driver

679
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:20,430
the or chill acaso es actually ran

680
00:42:20,430 --> 00:42:24,819
the bf driver even are talking to the
physical do I start let's always do you

681
00:42:24,819 --> 00:42:25,450
feel like

682
00:42:25,450 --> 00:42:30,180
%um is a media k to you likely than last
year to find some difference

683
00:42:30,180 --> 00:42:34,609
jet now those are dull like a quick
overview a ball while appeal

684
00:42:34,609 --> 00:42:38,690
sings with Pope's no to try to tell the
difference between physical

685
00:42:38,690 --> 00:42:42,740
and workshop now haas et relate resist
this

686
00:42:42,740 --> 00:42:47,650
up slavery I have to look at its site
the same from to site

687
00:42:47,650 --> 00:42:50,849
now the what I want to say that

688
00:42:50,849 --> 00:42:55,890
if the you know the User other amo side

689
00:42:55,890 --> 00:42:58,910
have access to at official level you
know

690
00:42:58,910 --> 00:43:02,020
or have access to kernel level more

691
00:43:02,020 --> 00:43:05,800
shape to run native call up our viewers
at least

692
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:09,230
it's pretty hard to prevent the other
side to figure it out

693
00:43:09,230 --> 00:43:13,089
care because it's so hard to you

694
00:43:13,089 --> 00:43:16,880
make stuff is going more chill look the
same email you have a lot of hard work

695
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:20,109
up which location to support us

696
00:43:20,109 --> 00:43:23,970
now if you want to let's go to say okay
what if I we know we focus on those

697
00:43:23,970 --> 00:43:26,740
which a lot appliance only

698
00:43:26,740 --> 00:43:30,500
up support that's quite artificially los
quince

699
00:43:30,500 --> 00:43:35,250
its possible use you can hi lot of the
the and specif

700
00:43:35,250 --> 00:43:39,339
information but timing and performance

701
00:43:39,339 --> 00:43:42,579
Weiss that type of a detection is

702
00:43:42,579 --> 00:43:45,680
grossly harder to you know to do so

703
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:49,339
up and also is pretty challenge to the

704
00:43:49,339 --> 00:43:52,430
you know prevent the target act like if
someone know

705
00:43:52,430 --> 00:43:56,480
at the target as using certain type of
machine I'll alice high and

706
00:43:56,480 --> 00:44:00,180
it's pretty hard to get with this that
happen detection

707
00:44:00,180 --> 00:44:04,250
now to summarize the talk what I told
you that

708
00:44:04,250 --> 00:44:08,329
beaded some a prelim for try to detect
which opalines

709
00:44:08,329 --> 00:44:12,180
and me focus on the detections true
though web scripts

710
00:44:12,180 --> 00:44:16,619
no using the let's go you can tell also
displayed related information

711
00:44:16,619 --> 00:44:19,780
and those are some simple hearsay you
can use

712
00:44:19,780 --> 00:44:24,770
are they also look at the case that if
you actually have a large appliance that

713
00:44:24,770 --> 00:44:27,940
Ryan potentially native coli K

714
00:44:27,940 --> 00:44:32,109
act to axe then potentially have more
information you can clash

715
00:44:32,109 --> 00:44:35,150
worries have lower level access to the
widest and

716
00:44:35,150 --> 00:44:38,310
as much easier to tell the difference

717
00:44:38,310 --> 00:44:41,349
I'll the raisin we

718
00:44:41,349 --> 00:44:46,190
use displayed information I want ran for
site this is because

719
00:44:46,190 --> 00:44:49,920
the display information often has to be
exposed to the application

720
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:54,880
even this is really for specialized case
like Adobe are you know

721
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:59,510
up browser so other many property could
potentially can be used and especially

722
00:44:59,510 --> 00:45:00,880
the performance side

723
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:04,250
K is all this I'm ready for

724
00:45:04,250 --> 00:45:11,250
questions

725
00:45:11,300 --> 00:45:18,300
destroyed

726
00:45:32,010 --> 00:45:35,910
right so the the you try to run job loco
its use rules

727
00:45:35,910 --> 00:45:41,310
JVM so they're surely in too tight to
level protection one is still actually

728
00:45:41,310 --> 00:45:42,500
tried to say

729
00:45:42,500 --> 00:45:46,220
you know alexei appliques it was a had
this

730
00:45:46,220 --> 00:45:49,480
ap lit been sign I so is up to

731
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:53,160
air from the attack upon beers up to
them to figure out how to sign it

732
00:45:53,160 --> 00:45:56,840
the second case is certainly the alert
level

733
00:45:56,840 --> 00:46:00,970
access to say simply say dole run any of
the you know tell outlet

734
00:46:00,970 --> 00:46:04,150
so if that's the case then up

735
00:46:04,150 --> 00:46:07,330
you know you're not a club in the nation
information but again

736
00:46:07,330 --> 00:46:10,600
if you believe you can have a size that

737
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:13,810
and use actual like the run and your CV

738
00:46:13,810 --> 00:46:18,510
up let's which and if you know they've
been around it like later

739
00:46:18,510 --> 00:46:21,750
you have the site up in a like the word
supplies also lent

740
00:46:21,750 --> 00:46:25,510
and also if they don't run you actually
get the exception

741
00:46:25,510 --> 00:46:29,000
now while the exception mean I don't
know K basis

742
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:36,000
you have it may be changed to a
different so so that

743
00:46:41,570 --> 00:46:45,170
you cannot because the the way we

744
00:46:45,170 --> 00:46:48,770
the TAC washer machine where Cecil
machine

745
00:46:48,770 --> 00:46:52,410
is actually try this up say that romash
actually run faster

746
00:46:52,410 --> 00:46:56,510
so I'll as you can make the clock faster
relate

747
00:46:56,510 --> 00:46:59,960
makes things a lot faster then you can't
issue this is

748
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:06,080
detection well what was slower Minardi
indicate

749
00:47:06,080 --> 00:47:10,430
you're likely now the real one so make a
more slower doesn't help

750
00:47:10,430 --> 00:47:17,430
maybe I misunderstood your question
gonna my bed this is the seal a look at

751
00:47:29,910 --> 00:47:31,770
the time and performance

752
00:47:31,770 --> 00:47:36,110
we actually know the physical one
physical machine African Rand

753
00:47:36,110 --> 00:47:39,510
can render the box much faster right up

754
00:47:39,510 --> 00:47:42,890
be you try to you to watch appliance

755
00:47:42,890 --> 00:47:45,980
you all you can do is slow down you can
now call faster

756
00:47:45,980 --> 00:47:52,070
me

757
00:47:52,070 --> 00:47:55,370
is

758
00:47:55,370 --> 00:48:00,940
think right now okay

759
00:48:00,940 --> 00:48:04,410
okay II got it okay red this

760
00:48:04,410 --> 00:48:09,860
me red okay I college so so if you
actually

761
00:48:09,860 --> 00:48:14,080
are didn't know in 10 delay to you know
did you not know their arse

762
00:48:14,080 --> 00:48:17,300
the script potentially are using time
information

763
00:48:17,300 --> 00:48:20,930
and you can't write on you lie about as
big as you can you play the timing

764
00:48:20,930 --> 00:48:24,610
just sent you my pic a crater you lose
and that

765
00:48:24,610 --> 00:48:27,950
you know your rendering much faster I'll

766
00:48:27,950 --> 00:48:32,600
it in I don't have a dark a responsible
that I had no I understand the the

767
00:48:32,600 --> 00:48:33,400
technique

768
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:38,920
are so I guess up I will have to think
more about the list and see you know

769
00:48:38,920 --> 00:48:40,920
whether it's complete break their
pro-china

770
00:48:40,920 --> 00:48:47,920
sorry can you repeat the question

771
00:48:52,950 --> 00:48:57,270
of the non

772
00:48:57,270 --> 00:49:03,070
except and vitamin do you have any at
that he texted me but that you can cite

773
00:49:03,070 --> 00:49:03,950
yes but the non

774
00:49:03,950 --> 00:49:09,530
X as I'm beast I'm not difficult write
about it but let's say your column let

775
00:49:09,530 --> 00:49:11,830
me make sure I understand the question
so the question is:

776
00:49:11,830 --> 00:49:16,160
if there's no display can use to detect
by not if let's say you are not be

777
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:16,690
fapping

778
00:49:16,690 --> 00:49:20,130
its so you are deemed us a explore

779
00:49:20,130 --> 00:49:23,500
is dead we can be big way so

780
00:49:23,500 --> 00:49:26,550
again if you have any way to apps

781
00:49:26,550 --> 00:49:30,450
ran Lexie in children general 4 p.m.
detection if you can

782
00:49:30,450 --> 00:49:33,940
Ryan the Africa application-level
program

783
00:49:33,940 --> 00:49:38,430
they're really lost soul way for example
I believe is shown in the talkin

784
00:49:38,430 --> 00:49:43,770
a different presentation for example if
you look at how the NOP instruction

785
00:49:43,770 --> 00:49:46,790
and executed and so

786
00:49:46,790 --> 00:49:50,910
in the physical machine not construction
it's really a special instruction

787
00:49:50,910 --> 00:49:54,680
but for hypervisor NOP instruction

788
00:49:54,680 --> 00:49:58,970
can be traded may be different so thirst
are you need to do is find all those

789
00:49:58,970 --> 00:50:00,200
subtle difference

790
00:50:00,200 --> 00:50:04,480
so I have to understand that particular

791
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:07,560
you know which appliance what what did
while Canadian

792
00:50:07,560 --> 00:50:13,710
now we can say okay other any clue we
can use have hit by proper to default

793
00:50:13,710 --> 00:50:16,220
before probably configuration setting up
the VM

794
00:50:16,220 --> 00:50:20,590
VMware IBM what's whatever it is grace
Solwezi

795
00:50:20,590 --> 00:50:23,750
if she so we are right now limited the
the

796
00:50:23,750 --> 00:50:27,790
the study right now we have a certainly
tried like VMware

797
00:50:27,790 --> 00:50:31,260
sandwich or box and be

798
00:50:31,260 --> 00:50:34,330
want to actually expand to more of the

799
00:50:34,330 --> 00:50:38,540
a wiser and we also want to access more
of the

800
00:50:38,540 --> 00:50:41,820
which appliance so if you have no

801
00:50:41,820 --> 00:50:45,990
if you want to you know gave us some
access to I'll be one happy to look at

802
00:50:45,990 --> 00:50:47,390
that

803
00:50:47,390 --> 00:50:54,390
keep

804
00:50:56,280 --> 00:50:59,330
using your current approach what is that
I know

805
00:50:59,330 --> 00:51:03,520
false-positive in that

806
00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:08,410
dub part I don't have the number now
haha okay I saw it again this is a

807
00:51:08,410 --> 00:51:11,730
quite preliminary efforts and

808
00:51:11,730 --> 00:51:15,830
I guess in terms of Oz posit said I O
said

809
00:51:15,830 --> 00:51:20,550
now we have two look at specific target
this ain't no maybe you wanna say

810
00:51:20,550 --> 00:51:24,990
wallet a false positive to the attack
watch a box paste

811
00:51:24,990 --> 00:51:28,240
appliance or maybe even more
specifically to say

812
00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:32,390
while is a false positive to detect if
are if I die in the middle

813
00:51:32,390 --> 00:51:36,680
so that you know the it is you wanna get
any new phone number

814
00:51:36,680 --> 00:51:40,340
has to be I was a pickup particle target

815
00:51:40,340 --> 00:51:43,440
am i right to say that it is not I know

816
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:47,200
ninety percent reliable things like that

817
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:51,580
a I will say drain all what a PIA
propose

818
00:51:51,580 --> 00:51:55,730
I will have just be honest that I was a
if you want to do your chin Irish type

819
00:51:55,730 --> 00:51:57,390
of detection

820
00:51:57,390 --> 00:52:01,980
I'll if you can grab this claim
resolution a seamless a war job oxley

821
00:52:01,980 --> 00:52:02,710
America

822
00:52:02,710 --> 00:52:06,020
India said anything special a party can
detect very

823
00:52:06,020 --> 00:52:09,140
know precisely but if you talk about

824
00:52:09,140 --> 00:52:13,900
you know using like timing and you know
a place you know the sport of the

825
00:52:13,900 --> 00:52:17,170
you know web-dl hi I'm not gonna be say

826
00:52:17,170 --> 00:52:20,960
competent number now hi okay our goal
much lower

827
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:24,670
%uh bed and again I keep mentioning that

828
00:52:24,670 --> 00:52:28,160
if you have a targeted attack if you
already know this

829
00:52:28,160 --> 00:52:32,240
you know this is the guy running i7 box

830
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:35,570
and I just want to know whether in the
middle there some other

831
00:52:35,570 --> 00:52:41,170
in machine protect this target then I
think you can get very high accuracy

832
00:52:41,170 --> 00:52:44,450
%eh AG that's my next question snow this

833
00:52:44,450 --> 00:52:47,550
oh yes look that method can be if you
use it

834
00:52:47,550 --> 00:52:51,400
one will know on poverty attack because
there's a lot of Britain

835
00:52:51,400 --> 00:52:55,260
lines is in radio stop so you need to
check so many things

836
00:52:55,260 --> 00:52:58,500
yeah there will be an the explosion
other coated

837
00:52:58,500 --> 00:53:02,440
right how useful the current one I was
say

838
00:53:02,440 --> 00:53:05,720
if you want to use you wonder if you
want to build a toward immediately using

839
00:53:05,720 --> 00:53:06,830
this

840
00:53:06,830 --> 00:53:10,680
i wont black mind that because I don't
think this mature that level

841
00:53:10,680 --> 00:53:14,540
Harbor I do feel like hopefully this is
something in car Jing

842
00:53:14,540 --> 00:53:18,400
people look at especially people know
more about the display parts

843
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:21,460
so that they'll be my response thank you

844
00:53:21,460 --> 00:53:25,220
York

845
00:53:25,220 --> 00:53:28,580
any more questions lying

846
00:53:28,580 --> 00:53:32,020
I know I'm standing between you know you
and lunch Sol

847
00:53:32,020 --> 00:53:32,470
enjoyed
