1
00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:05,060
good morning I'm John Ortiz I'm here to
talk about the advanced AI graffiti this

2
00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:06,460
Jay pics taken i fi

3
00:00:06,460 --> 00:00:11,710
and detection okay alright so what are
these two images

4
00:00:11,710 --> 00:00:17,740
has about 69,000 bites hidden in it had
a file size: about 330,000 bites

5
00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:24,000
which is about 20 percent and the file
so we can take a closer look

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,039
the dim the lights a little bit

7
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:33,579
for this one so this is the picture on
the left his picture on the right

8
00:00:33,579 --> 00:00:36,690
laughed

9
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:40,820
right looking at it closely

10
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:45,190
I special I get the look above the eye
might never see slight differences

11
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:49,379
but there's no way you can tell that one
of them has in data

12
00:00:49,379 --> 00:00:53,870
the oh and does not and as the hidden
data

13
00:00:53,870 --> 00:00:57,620
distant just image you actually hiding

14
00:00:57,620 --> 00:01:02,850
anything inside a pay but everyone hi
sale talk about today

15
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:06,140
or overview the Jay pag algorithm I

16
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:11,060
and how to exploit it for hiding you've
got about 10 different techniques

17
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:14,650
to talk about and then how to detect

18
00:01:14,650 --> 00:01:18,189
exploited apex never have time to do
demonstration

19
00:01:18,189 --> 00:01:21,380
and got about 150 slides so

20
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:27,229
want to go really fast I'm kidding that
makes 85 not sound so bad

21
00:01:27,229 --> 00:01:30,650
right now

22
00:01:30,650 --> 00:01:34,030
so just a little bit about me I'm an
engineer

23
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:38,030
part-time professor and part time
comedian I'm

24
00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:41,210
I was always an engineer from birth you
know I carried

25
00:01:41,210 --> 00:01:45,579
powers up to when I was a kid instead
sheep I know somebody all have done that

26
00:01:45,579 --> 00:01:45,960
too

27
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:49,579
IPO's I first came when I was to the
fourth

28
00:01:49,579 --> 00:01:52,600
and then a couple others throughout
college

29
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:55,799
yet heard evidence I like pac-man or
anything

30
00:01:55,799 --> 00:01:59,180
have graduate from school join the
airforce

31
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:04,149
I'm got a master's degree work for by
two different companies they keep giving

32
00:02:04,149 --> 00:02:05,090
sold

33
00:02:05,090 --> 00:02:09,459
currently working for Harris IT services
and I do reverse engineering and

34
00:02:09,459 --> 00:02:14,470
now we're now so stay entire fee is
kinda hobby of mine and you will see a

35
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:15,989
slide by me being a comedian

36
00:02:15,989 --> 00:02:19,470
because I'm not that funny see what I
mean

37
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:23,040
alright the J hang out with super easy

38
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:26,760
I JK was developed

39
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:29,970
because there is a big need for data
compression and there still is shape a

40
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:30,849
guest by the most

41
00:02:30,849 --> 00:02:36,230
ubiquitous file format on the Internet
and here's the algorithm

42
00:02:36,230 --> 00:02:39,900
and a look easy so we have

43
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:44,150
the color plane convergent we can borrow
from outside signed

44
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:49,140
we do this thing called the discrete
cosine transform week 1 ties it

45
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:52,599
run-length encoded and entropy coding

46
00:02:52,599 --> 00:02:57,330
so basically we apply some lotion
compression and then we apply some

47
00:02:57,330 --> 00:03:01,810
lossless compression so the color came

48
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:05,720
plane conversion goes from RGB which is
normal red green blue

49
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:10,590
to why icrc be the reason it does that
is because we can compress

50
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:14,870
the chrome its components more then
eliminates the human eye is a sense that

51
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:15,730
the croats

52
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:19,670
so we can actually compress them more
and still have a very good looking image

53
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:23,519
then we quantize it it uses different

54
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:27,379
quantization tables for the limits and
the crow minutes that's how it

55
00:03:27,379 --> 00:03:28,440
compresses it more

56
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:32,299
here's the formula when I can talk about
that when I have time

57
00:03:32,299 --> 00:03:36,629
but if they're the size the reference
how to convert from RGB to icrc be

58
00:03:36,629 --> 00:03:42,060
we do a two-dimensional

59
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:46,239
discrete cosine transform I don't
remember who wrote this I'll read it to

60
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:46,640
you

61
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:49,989
the purpose of this is to modulate the
influence a different spectral

62
00:03:49,989 --> 00:03:51,190
components on the image

63
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:55,769
all it means is we separate the low
frequencies from the high frequencies

64
00:03:55,769 --> 00:03:59,640
the high frequencies contribute less
detail so we can get rid of them

65
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:03,650
and still have a good image here's the
formula

66
00:04:03,650 --> 00:04:06,970
in the class a teacher we go through in
great detail

67
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:11,390
it looks really ugly doesn't it but it's
not as

68
00:04:11,390 --> 00:04:14,610
it's actually not that bad so

69
00:04:14,610 --> 00:04:19,070
real quick here 30 basically the

70
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:23,410
a so that's why is your pixel value and
then this is goodbye to cosign stuff

71
00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:26,900
and X&Y go from

72
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:30,800
0707 because it's in a bite block

73
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:35,270
which is the size the day take is to
work with and it just add it all up

74
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:39,729
and multiplies by these cuz i aint he
can be implemented in software

75
00:04:39,729 --> 00:04:45,630
very easily with that just 24

76
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:48,889
nested for loop okay the

77
00:04:48,889 --> 00:04:52,590
the basis they see down there that a
four-dimensional ray their actually

78
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:56,320
is a use for a four dimensional ray and
this is that you calculate all the

79
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,900
cosine stuff points

80
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:02,520
and then you just use it had to multiply
by the pixel values instead of

81
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:06,990
recalculating the cosine because cosine
calculation is slow

82
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:10,600
so it's very fast sony's a bite block

83
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:15,259
you end up doing 4,096 calculations

84
00:05:15,259 --> 00:05:18,759
saw it up an image that's what 512 by
512

85
00:05:18,759 --> 00:05:23,520
and that's sad six-time 664

86
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:26,699
than a four thousand I'm sad four
thousand and six blocks

87
00:05:26,699 --> 00:05:31,110
he to 4,096 calculations seems very slow

88
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:34,199
so people ask me all the time well how
long does it take to do all that

89
00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:38,380
well when he opened today it does all
that

90
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:42,509
so that's how long 3.6 gigahertz is
really fast

91
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:46,530
then after we do this cosine transform
and we quantize it

92
00:05:46,530 --> 00:05:50,400
we divide the a by a black by another a
bite block

93
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:54,810
the colonization table we end up with
what's called the quantized DCT

94
00:05:54,810 --> 00:05:57,419
coefficients

95
00:05:57,419 --> 00:06:02,680
thats was taken out of the habit in the
quantized DCT coefficients

96
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:05,949
so that's why it's important to kinda at
least have a rough understanding

97
00:06:05,949 --> 00:06:09,710
at how the J paid works now from there a
line

98
00:06:09,710 --> 00:06:12,990
after you get the quantized DCT
coefficients the

99
00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:17,680
compression is lossless so whatever you
change those coefficients to

100
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:22,110
I the run-length encoding and a half and
coding they get saved to disk

101
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:25,600
those changes are saved to disk their
night compress the way anymore

102
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:31,240
because there's no loss in those
processes

103
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:34,630
so here's a a mandrel which is a very
common

104
00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:38,300
image when you working with the steak
and I feel see this mantra image I love

105
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:39,699
the place

106
00:06:39,699 --> 00:06:43,759
and the numbers you see on the screen or
the actual values

107
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:47,139
from that file now this is a grayscale
file

108
00:06:47,139 --> 00:06:50,569
so there's no chrome its component
there's only

109
00:06:50,569 --> 00:06:54,830
the luminance component in this one my
expanded the pics also you can see the

110
00:06:54,830 --> 00:07:01,830
colors and see the actual numbers there
there

111
00:07:02,199 --> 00:07:06,840
so here's the actual numbers here are
the DCT values

112
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:10,750
after taking this a light blocking in
putting it through

113
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:13,880
that discrete cosine transform you end
up with

114
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:18,990
these values claimed those those are the
actual values

115
00:07:18,990 --> 00:07:23,680
then that we apply this quantization
table in my hand always shakes

116
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:27,020
it's why I'm not a surgeon ahead

117
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:32,169
there was a hoops no so we take this
value here

118
00:07:32,169 --> 00:07:36,009
and abide by that are you there to get
that to you there

119
00:07:36,009 --> 00:07:40,009
he's going to have to use the screen we
take this value here

120
00:07:40,009 --> 00:07:43,740
divide by that are you to get that value
and so forth so

121
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:48,370
in other words for each element in the
DCT ray

122
00:07:48,370 --> 00:07:53,340
we divide by the corresponding element
in the quantization array

123
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:58,280
and the result is this one so noticed
all the zeros

124
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:03,039
a lot of those values go away leaving
only a few appear

125
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:07,139
and then that portion is run length
encoding it has been encoded

126
00:08:07,139 --> 00:08:10,229
so it's compressed and then compressed
again

127
00:08:10,229 --> 00:08:13,639
and that's why I J Pat does so well it
as patterned

128
00:08:13,639 --> 00:08:20,110
and then it gets rid a lotta stuff that
you can see

129
00:08:20,110 --> 00:08:23,440
well here's the numbers after
quantization and now we're gonna go

130
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:27,979
backwards okay this is with your opening
and a peck on a desk

131
00:08:27,979 --> 00:08:32,409
so we take that number multiply by their
number we get that number

132
00:08:32,409 --> 00:08:36,169
that one what i buy that one get that
one

133
00:08:36,169 --> 00:08:39,890
and so forth okay these are the

134
00:08:39,890 --> 00:08:43,169
decline ties to values I

135
00:08:43,169 --> 00:08:47,430
and then these are the original diets so
there's a big difference

136
00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:51,820
right this is 9384 this is Nate 377

137
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:56,190
and there's a lot of zeros down here but
that's okay

138
00:08:56,190 --> 00:09:01,800
the picture still looks good

139
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:05,709
and then when we runners through the
reverse DCT algorithm

140
00:09:05,709 --> 00:09:09,029
which is very similar to that other
formula showed you gay

141
00:09:09,029 --> 00:09:12,290
you're not in the reverse and you get
the new

142
00:09:12,290 --> 00:09:15,940
actual pixel values these are the actual
pixel values

143
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:19,560
in the result they're not exactly the
same

144
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:23,779
127 129 147 145

145
00:09:23,779 --> 00:09:27,660
but they're close and so it still looks
good

146
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:32,110
it's different mathematically but
visually to us humans

147
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:36,680
it looks very close

148
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:41,200
so there's just a sample calculation for
that 512 by 512 image

149
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:44,630
as I mentioned so there's sixteen
million calculations

150
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:48,459
from him is like that plus stuff and
encoding the color playing conversion

151
00:09:48,459 --> 00:09:51,000
the run-length encoding and all that

152
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,029
and a 512 by 512 pretty small image

153
00:09:54,029 --> 00:09:58,470
on the screen

154
00:09:58,470 --> 00:10:01,660
but we have passed computers so

155
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:04,779
then back in 10 bucks

156
00:10:04,779 --> 00:10:07,899
right you've got to understand

157
00:10:07,899 --> 00:10:11,399
the DCT coefficients Sol say one more
thing about those

158
00:10:11,399 --> 00:10:15,790
he do on the math you get these values
he quantize them

159
00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:19,279
and then those are the numbers that you
can manipulate

160
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:22,380
for hiding those are the numbers that we
manipulate and there's

161
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:25,800
by two different ways to manipulate him
and we're going to look at I think about

162
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:30,019
10 other

163
00:10:30,019 --> 00:10:33,860
first one is called us what the C team

164
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:37,610
this one's kinda interesting it's it's
different than a lot of the others

165
00:10:37,610 --> 00:10:41,480
I'm me this came directly from a
published paper

166
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:46,980
the author pics in DCT coefficients
gonna try the mouse here

167
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:50,630
might be better she can you see a
vacancy at also

168
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:53,680
so you take this is a quiet session
table so you take a couple up

169
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:58,420
coefficients at a time either the 14th
or the 24 so the 22's

170
00:10:58,420 --> 00:11:01,480
pick one of those pairs and then

171
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:05,550
you do this for each a by a black in the
image the really image do all the math

172
00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:07,480
and you get your a bite block

173
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:11,269
a DCT coefficient and the region message

174
00:11:11,269 --> 00:11:15,190
and the message can be anything don't
have to be a picture taken the

175
00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:19,570
PowerPoint slide presentation can be an
executable file they can be a zip file I

176
00:11:19,570 --> 00:11:20,209
can be

177
00:11:20,209 --> 00:11:23,529
encrypt it it doesn't matter the message
to the

178
00:11:23,529 --> 00:11:27,399
hiding elder them looks just like a
stream of bits

179
00:11:27,399 --> 00:11:31,380
is read a bit by bit so you reach a
message

180
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:35,850
and you look at the coefficient value
now remember what's on the screen here

181
00:11:35,850 --> 00:11:38,709
is the quantization table that's not the
coefficient eyes that's just the

182
00:11:38,709 --> 00:11:39,890
quantization table

183
00:11:39,890 --> 00:11:45,029
showing which pairs of coefficients we
chose to hide it

184
00:11:45,029 --> 00:11:48,390
and you're looking a message and and is
arbitrary

185
00:11:48,390 --> 00:11:53,149
which way you go but I will say if your
message that is a0

186
00:11:53,149 --> 00:11:56,750
then coefficient one has to be greater
than television to

187
00:11:56,750 --> 00:12:00,760
you message me it's a wine than
coefficient to st. grazing to official

188
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:02,170
warning

189
00:12:02,170 --> 00:12:05,230
so sometimes that's already true

190
00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:08,269
sometimes when he checked the
coefficients the correct

191
00:12:08,269 --> 00:12:12,279
ratio is already valid so you don't
change anything

192
00:12:12,279 --> 00:12:16,950
your message is already there and go on
to the next block

193
00:12:16,950 --> 00:12:20,149
if the message isn't there then a swap

194
00:12:20,149 --> 00:12:23,610
the DCT coefficients so they're in
different positions

195
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:27,230
so that now it is true and you don't
have to

196
00:12:27,230 --> 00:12:34,230
he just that so you have to change and
then you on to the next book

197
00:12:34,610 --> 00:12:38,790
so they sing I wear them selected cover
black at the DCT transform read the

198
00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:39,850
message bit

199
00:12:39,850 --> 00:12:43,540
I'm check the ratio if it's true don't
change anything move on to the next

200
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:44,380
block

201
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:48,510
that's not true slut the coefficients
move on to the next book

202
00:12:48,510 --> 00:12:52,430
so on extraction all you have to do is

203
00:12:52,430 --> 00:12:56,120
read if I am look at the coefficients
and say if

204
00:12:56,120 --> 00:13:00,200
CZ rose gold as you are she wanted a
lengthy 28 2012 seat is greater than

205
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,000
seem

206
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,230
as he wanted to one extract out and say
that

207
00:13:04,230 --> 00:13:09,990
go the next block into the sale your
bets

208
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:14,089
I I will mention the these authors is
the on quantized coefficients I don't

209
00:13:14,089 --> 00:13:14,769
know why

210
00:13:14,769 --> 00:13:17,820
makes it a lot harder to work with I'm I
did

211
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:22,760
implement this algorithm and the stage a
paint program which

212
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:26,010
all your welcome I have to see what the
program you can email me or whatever and

213
00:13:26,010 --> 00:13:28,339
I'll be happy to make available to you

214
00:13:28,339 --> 00:13:31,820
and I but I did not work with the and
client eyes coefficients I worked with

215
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:32,250
the

216
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:36,279
quantized coefficients because light
easier

217
00:13:36,279 --> 00:13:40,550
well this is kinda low capacity can only
do one bit black

218
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:46,430
so with the 256 by 256 image daiwa 1024
blocks 1024 bits

219
00:13:46,430 --> 00:13:50,959
so it's only 128 bytes very much

220
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:54,579
can ease of repairs well

221
00:13:54,579 --> 00:13:58,699
some other authors came along in
deciding to improve on that a little bit

222
00:13:58,699 --> 00:14:02,079
and days they said coefficients

223
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:05,740
to use while and they actually had a

224
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:09,079
set up by a causation since they were
gonna pick

225
00:14:09,079 --> 00:14:12,430
three of these a coefficient and and

226
00:14:12,430 --> 00:14:16,000
use those ratios to swap

227
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,310
can get a little bit more robustness
added it I'm and get a little bit

228
00:14:20,310 --> 00:14:24,920
I will get the same to pass the one day
per block it gets harder to extract

229
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:29,050
because the extractor needs to know for
each block

230
00:14:29,050 --> 00:14:32,370
which coefficients daily pic in the
other method

231
00:14:32,370 --> 00:14:35,389
we just simply use the same coefficients
every single time

232
00:14:35,389 --> 00:14:38,860
to in this method they're picked from a
said

233
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:44,180
coefficients

234
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:47,839
so I looked at that and I thought well

235
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:52,579
why just two coefficients are three 3
coefficient 24

236
00:14:52,579 --> 00:14:56,660
when I is all along see how that works

237
00:14:56,660 --> 00:15:01,079
showing I select have 31 pairs a
coefficient

238
00:15:01,079 --> 00:15:06,260
in this particular implementation

239
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:09,430
now I found that you don't want to use

240
00:15:09,430 --> 00:15:13,649
the DC coefficient which is that one

241
00:15:13,649 --> 00:15:17,610
because he change that ended really
distorts the image alive

242
00:15:17,610 --> 00:15:22,620
I also found that using these two really
distorts the image alive

243
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:25,970
so the program does allow you to use P
I'm

244
00:15:25,970 --> 00:15:29,250
those two but you get a really distorted
image

245
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:33,350
as we'll see all the rest get to be used

246
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:36,579
and I'll see the results I 1000
experimentally

247
00:15:36,579 --> 00:15:40,370
that I can use up to about 24 pairs

248
00:15:40,370 --> 00:15:45,019
coefficients and image will still look
pretty gay

249
00:15:45,019 --> 00:15:48,269
so I just show the matching pairs appear
that I chosen the

250
00:15:48,269 --> 00:15:52,250
program will go threes black and just go
through all the matching pairs

251
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:55,820
now one thing my implementation does is
it does not make

252
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:59,209
any changes to the values of the
coefficient so if they're

253
00:15:59,209 --> 00:16:03,060
equal it just gives them

254
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:06,100
so if there is a recall that it doesn't
change in other than that

255
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:09,130
they can ease into slot and there's a
reason for that and we'll see that when

256
00:16:09,130 --> 00:16:12,930
we get to the detection Park

257
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:17,740
so here's an implementation I used at 24
pairs

258
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:21,589
in this particular case so 6.5 percent

259
00:16:21,589 --> 00:16:24,600
random bytes hidden in this image

260
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:28,420
that attendance for black on average for
almost 11

261
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:31,980
and so much higher capacity and I still
even

262
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:35,740
it's not as clear on the screen of
course but even on the monitor Zintan

263
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:40,430
I can see a different

264
00:16:40,430 --> 00:16:45,550
so that is implemented on the program
he's raised $31 coefficient

265
00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:49,139
can anyone see a difference on that one

266
00:16:49,139 --> 00:16:53,199
you can there he can really see the
distortion right

267
00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:56,259
at that's pretty clear on that one and
has the story

268
00:16:56,259 --> 00:17:00,560
and if you look at it closely what you
find is kinda the block is reversed like

269
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:01,470
if it's got a

270
00:17:01,470 --> 00:17:04,929
pain the dark i'm happier than light on
the other half its kinda

271
00:17:04,929 --> 00:17:08,079
mirrored find their I sell

272
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:12,220
31 was too much if you care that gets
noticed by human

273
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:15,449
course sometimes you may not care
forgiveness by human

274
00:17:15,449 --> 00:17:19,470
you know you try to protect your network
who's the guy that has to sit around it

275
00:17:19,470 --> 00:17:22,970
look at all the Tapex come across

276
00:17:22,970 --> 00:17:26,319
I did Emma whites and just browsing

277
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:29,970
web sites with head a a minute

278
00:17:29,970 --> 00:17:33,919
I got thousands of little tape
eight-hour download it to my computer

279
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:37,419
so sometimes when you're hiding this
stuff you enrich really campus

280
00:17:37,419 --> 00:17:38,780
noticeable by human

281
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:42,230
maybe only care if it's noticeable
statistically okay

282
00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:46,429
but this will look feel like it's a pain
to any program that analyzed it

283
00:17:46,429 --> 00:17:53,429
as far as in a check in the Belletti at
the bile

284
00:17:54,590 --> 00:17:58,299
well you can also add kar Tiger P to the
max

285
00:17:58,299 --> 00:18:02,360
so for anyone to these techniques you
can just encrypt your message

286
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:05,700
before you actually put it in there and
that'll complicate extraction

287
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:09,640
because then if you extracted they had a
Kryptonite

288
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:12,650
but doing that's no fun so

289
00:18:12,650 --> 00:18:17,600
I built a little cartography into the
program penalties on my ex orkut octopi

290
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:22,200
and interpretation now the permutation
is cool because

291
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:26,000
it will then spread the message over the
entire image

292
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,460
for instance if the message is smaller
then the capacity

293
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:33,600
college a tag it comes from top to
bottom and so you would see distortion

294
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,150
in the top half the picture

295
00:18:35,150 --> 00:18:39,520
and not distortion in the bottom half so
that's a very clear indication

296
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:43,190
had something is going on so

297
00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:47,480
looking at the 24 pairs I'm

298
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:51,470
I saved each pair analyst as it went
through so as it processed the day they

299
00:18:51,470 --> 00:18:52,320
get just

300
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:55,860
cezanne analyst and then later way at
all diane

301
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:58,960
here is a message permits the list and

302
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:02,039
swatch the coefficients as a choir

303
00:19:02,039 --> 00:19:05,169
so it spread cryptographically over the
entire

304
00:19:05,169 --> 00:19:08,770
in it

305
00:19:08,770 --> 00:19:11,820
alright so that's that's what technique
in a couple variations

306
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:15,390
then there's the least significant bit
technique you probably heard at least

307
00:19:15,390 --> 00:19:17,460
significant bits with respect to bitmaps

308
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:20,990
well we can use the least significant
bit all the

309
00:19:20,990 --> 00:19:25,789
quantized DCT coefficients just as the
way you can with the event

310
00:19:25,789 --> 00:19:30,350
the lot more capacity than when they
were black basically get one bit

311
00:19:30,350 --> 00:19:34,039
her well 90 or 91 coefficient

312
00:19:34,039 --> 00:19:37,410
you cannot use the one coefficient to
hide

313
00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:41,250
a value because if your message bit is 0

314
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:45,240
well then the wind changes 20 and now
you have a zero there

315
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:49,520
and if you zero died you can end up
changing a lot as he rose to winds

316
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:52,900
which is gonna vastly increase the file
size:

317
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:56,650
and also be very noticeable so we all
use wine

318
00:19:56,650 --> 00:19:59,940
you know e0 but everything else we can
use me

319
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:03,190
we can use -1 because when you change

320
00:20:03,190 --> 00:20:07,809
the least significant bit have a
negative one try the mouse again

321
00:20:07,809 --> 00:20:12,480
there's a negative one in binary it
changes 20

322
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:17,000
and that's actually a native to so -1
because they did too

323
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:23,000
90 when you change the least they can
bet

324
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:27,309
so here's a image I hid using LSD
technique

325
00:20:27,309 --> 00:20:30,450
call the 65 I the

326
00:20:30,450 --> 00:20:34,659
the standard quantization table that I
showed you just for a frame of reference

327
00:20:34,659 --> 00:20:39,500
is a quality of fifty K so that's kinda
right in the middle

328
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:43,309
and then you can make a higher quality
by putting lower numbers in there

329
00:20:43,309 --> 00:20:46,299
and you can make a lower quality by
putting higher numbers in there the

330
00:20:46,299 --> 00:20:48,360
higher the numbers are you too bye bye

331
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:52,140
the more zeros you get in the output I
am

332
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:55,520
most the J peg ending programs that i've
seen

333
00:20:55,520 --> 00:21:00,000
will allow you to adjust the quality you
know say that high quality low quality

334
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,679
type thing

335
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:05,210
so-called e65 as well as use for this

336
00:21:05,210 --> 00:21:10,179
and the storage capacity the bell 50,000
bites which is about 15 percent at the

337
00:21:10,179 --> 00:21:12,010
file size:

338
00:21:12,010 --> 00:21:16,080
quality equals a hundred we have a
storage capacity F

339
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:19,230
than 97,000 but so about

340
00:21:19,230 --> 00:21:22,990
40,000 bytes more better-looking

341
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:27,110
that the file sizes larger who cares

342
00:21:27,110 --> 00:21:30,340
mean how many look at the file size:
huge apex

343
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:35,220
me maybe he take file you take pictures
with your camera get 348 megabyte files

344
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:36,230
out a bit

345
00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:39,340
but yes 01 may I might take file

346
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:43,289
big deal

347
00:21:43,289 --> 00:21:48,409
Palin guess is a technique that's been
out there for quite some time

348
00:21:48,409 --> 00:21:52,100
I the source code is available online

349
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:56,360
and it's a little bit different in that

350
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:59,650
in makes two passes on DJ big image

351
00:21:59,650 --> 00:22:04,190
come the first pass it hides a message
in the bath and then on the second pass

352
00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:07,330
it goes in changes unused bits

353
00:22:07,330 --> 00:22:11,929
to try to balance the statistics and
we'll look at the statistics in the

354
00:22:11,929 --> 00:22:13,870
second half the presentation

355
00:22:13,870 --> 00:22:18,419
make sure I get there K so the
statistics and the filer better

356
00:22:18,419 --> 00:22:19,330
preserved

357
00:22:19,330 --> 00:22:24,270
without guess which makes detection more
difficult

358
00:22:24,270 --> 00:22:27,559
we have test-fired pathfinder's

359
00:22:27,559 --> 00:22:31,380
pride in one of the toughest ones to
crack I think it came out in the early

360
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:32,580
2000's

361
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:37,419
2002-2003 somewhere like that and took
about five years before researchers

362
00:22:37,419 --> 00:22:40,530
figured out a good way to the text fifi

363
00:22:40,530 --> 00:22:44,470
so it does things a does a number of
things

364
00:22:44,470 --> 00:22:47,809
I'm is really sophisticated and it's
really cool

365
00:22:47,809 --> 00:22:51,789
so first of all it hides in the in the
bed

366
00:22:51,789 --> 00:22:55,789
but it does not take the message a bit
and stuff it into

367
00:22:55,789 --> 00:23:01,130
the DCT coefficient rather it looks at
the least significant bit at the DCT

368
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:02,010
coefficient

369
00:23:02,010 --> 00:23:05,580
says does that match my message course
if it does

370
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:09,250
any move on if it doesn't it subtracts

371
00:23:09,250 --> 00:23:12,980
wind from that coefficients from the
mandated

372
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:16,909
so one minus 10 and so i cant hide their

373
00:23:16,909 --> 00:23:20,250
-1 -1 israeli native to

374
00:23:20,250 --> 00:23:23,470
but its attacks one from the mandated so
-1

375
00:23:23,470 --> 00:23:27,250
goes to zero so i cant hide and native
18 there

376
00:23:27,250 --> 00:23:32,750
K so one in the I'm guess one other
distractions is that you get more zeros

377
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:37,020
with the f5 algorithm once you hit in
the image

378
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:40,380
at night as it turns out it doesn't
really matter

379
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:44,240
other than that it's a track so if you
have a native to you

380
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:48,279
and its attraction comes native wine the
other positive its attraction because

381
00:23:48,279 --> 00:23:49,890
part positive one

382
00:23:49,890 --> 00:23:54,320
and the reason it does that is trying to
balance the statistics that the DCT

383
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:55,210
coefficients

384
00:23:55,210 --> 00:23:59,690
and you'll see that graphically little
bit later on so I don't get into it too

385
00:23:59,690 --> 00:24:01,250
much right now

386
00:24:01,250 --> 00:24:06,029
f'in is difficult to detect

387
00:24:06,029 --> 00:24:09,250
the other thing another thing it does is
it inverts the meaning

388
00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:13,970
other negative coefficient so 190

389
00:24:13,970 --> 00:24:19,789
by negative coefficient 0 into wine that
was also done to help keep the ballots

390
00:24:19,789 --> 00:24:22,799
it does per mutated straddling

391
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:25,809
which is just a fancy way of saying it
permeates

392
00:24:25,809 --> 00:24:29,390
the order at the coefficients their
heights in so that

393
00:24:29,390 --> 00:24:33,299
it spreads the message cryptographically
throughout the entire image it's not

394
00:24:33,299 --> 00:24:34,380
concentrated

395
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:37,390
in one spot

396
00:24:37,390 --> 00:24:41,029
and it uses matrix encoding

397
00:24:41,029 --> 00:24:46,159
the idea with major action coding is
Brittany's 3 DCT coefficients

398
00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:50,159
to hide two bits so it's a little less
efficient

399
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:53,549
you lose a little capacity from that

400
00:24:53,549 --> 00:24:57,090
but by doing it this way

401
00:24:57,090 --> 00:25:01,120
you only have to make a single bit
change no matter where you to message

402
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:02,240
bits are

403
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:06,200
you only have to make a single change at
most

404
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:11,870
to one of the three coefficients so it
reduces the amount of actual change

405
00:25:11,870 --> 00:25:15,690
because change in the coefficients it
what is what gets detected

406
00:25:15,690 --> 00:25:19,600
change in the coefficients what can be
detect either statistically

407
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:23,890
on the DCT values or on the other
technique we're gonna talk about

408
00:25:23,890 --> 00:25:29,600
detecting the black yes

409
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:33,080
another technique statistically
invisible steganography is

410
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:37,460
what they title it I but they can be
detected

411
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:41,669
there is no technique that I know of
that absolutely 100 percent

412
00:25:41,669 --> 00:25:44,750
I cannot be detected

413
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:47,929
I so what they do is they count

414
00:25:47,929 --> 00:25:52,330
company 90 DCT coefficients in a block

415
00:25:52,330 --> 00:25:56,390
and its over a certain threshold then no
hiding that block

416
00:25:56,390 --> 00:26:00,779
and if it's not they want now the
advantage of this

417
00:26:00,779 --> 00:26:04,900
is that they're actually kinda checking
each block for its

418
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:08,500
I'm its if it's good it's suitable

419
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:12,630
for hiding so like say he had a smoothie
sky backgrounder

420
00:26:12,630 --> 00:26:16,570
sunset or something like that that's
less suitable for hiding

421
00:26:16,570 --> 00:26:20,370
then a complex background with with
lotsa stuff going on in a

422
00:26:20,370 --> 00:26:24,179
in the image and so they are they
checked that first

423
00:26:24,179 --> 00:26:27,770
and if it's too smooth they don't hide
their so only this

424
00:26:27,770 --> 00:26:31,630
meet some complex the threshold did the
high

425
00:26:31,630 --> 00:26:35,650
so in there I threshold they need
between 20 and 39

426
00:26:35,650 --> 00:26:38,950
and the coefficient to be 90

427
00:26:38,950 --> 00:26:43,000
so it adds up and then add the
coefficients get asylum

428
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:46,210
and then if the sum equals a message for
good

429
00:26:46,210 --> 00:26:49,370
don't change anything the Sun doesn't
equal the message

430
00:26:49,370 --> 00:26:54,770
they can add or subtract one from the
largest magnitude coefficients

431
00:26:54,770 --> 00:26:58,340
so they only make a small bit change for
each block course

432
00:26:58,340 --> 00:27:04,909
you have a small capacity that way but
it is very difficult to detect

433
00:27:04,909 --> 00:27:08,539
he asks yet another steganographic

434
00:27:08,539 --> 00:27:11,580
a scheme that resist blind steganalysis

435
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:15,270
is another program is out there this one

436
00:27:15,270 --> 00:27:19,149
will select a larger then a by a black

437
00:27:19,149 --> 00:27:24,250
like maybe a ten by ten blocker 11 by 11
block and from that

438
00:27:24,250 --> 00:27:30,350
select a subset a buy a bike so in a ten
by ten like you can have nine different

439
00:27:30,350 --> 00:27:35,140
a might buy it at that and they don't
use any by a black that it selects

440
00:27:35,140 --> 00:27:38,360
which is different for every 10 by 10

441
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:41,630
and pride in that

442
00:27:41,630 --> 00:27:45,860
perform the conversion the colonization
and then hides in those DCT coefficient

443
00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:49,620
so there really is another way it kinda
complicating extraction

444
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:52,990
now they ended up having them heirs with
that technique

445
00:27:52,990 --> 00:27:57,440
I and so they had to implement air
correcting codes

446
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:02,029
in order to compensate for that

447
00:28:02,029 --> 00:28:06,870
my personal favorite is this one this is
the one that I use for the demo

448
00:28:06,870 --> 00:28:11,360
on this is the one we saw the dog
picture with the hidden data with the

449
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:11,789
hidden

450
00:28:11,789 --> 00:28:15,029
praying mantis so forth this high
capacity

451
00:28:15,029 --> 00:28:19,770
DCT algorithm it's basically an adaptive

452
00:28:19,770 --> 00:28:23,169
technique okay this technique

453
00:28:23,169 --> 00:28:26,890
adapts to the DCT coefficients

454
00:28:26,890 --> 00:28:30,720
so it hides more bits in the larger
televisions

455
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:33,750
in urbs the smartest

456
00:28:33,750 --> 00:28:38,850
course you can is 0 or 1 for the same
reason that we could use 01 in the other

457
00:28:38,850 --> 00:28:42,870
situation but with a larger car they
said they can hide more

458
00:28:42,870 --> 00:28:47,260
information I failed to get the

459
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:50,820
4 the fact that this technique to get
the best

460
00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:54,909
capacity kathy is a Claudia around
seventy-five

461
00:28:54,909 --> 00:28:59,960
if he is less than that then you got it
kinda manually lower the capacity

462
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:06,960
otherwise you can see it distortion will
see some examples that too

463
00:29:07,450 --> 00:29:11,429
so this will choose the block to be in
bed and then it checks the block for

464
00:29:11,429 --> 00:29:15,059
uniformly so it kinda does a little
analysis on the block it says is this a

465
00:29:15,059 --> 00:29:16,350
good life for hiding

466
00:29:16,350 --> 00:29:19,860
or not to get by for hiding even if it's
not that black

467
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:24,529
still use it but it automatically scales
the capacity that tries to use for that

468
00:29:24,529 --> 00:29:25,919
particular block

469
00:29:25,919 --> 00:29:31,760
so we have this out of value and we have
the uniform devalue and it'll determine

470
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:33,010
how many bits

471
00:29:33,010 --> 00:29:37,679
can I hide in that television

472
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:41,570
and then it replaces the message bits
mean that those that the message itself

473
00:29:41,570 --> 00:29:45,159
so with one television I might only had
one bit a graph that that

474
00:29:45,159 --> 00:29:49,279
put it here for another television you
might be able to hide three dates or

475
00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:50,120
four bits

476
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:56,740
so they regret forbids message and put
that in

477
00:29:56,740 --> 00:30:00,960
more math right the idea with the
uniformity

478
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:04,149
is that it uniform as before that
uniform

479
00:30:04,149 --> 00:30:07,990
plaque we're gonna be more sense that
the change if it's a nineteen

480
00:30:07,990 --> 00:30:12,250
blocks up its nine year for we can hide
more that's a porno there this summer

481
00:30:12,250 --> 00:30:13,080
the squares

482
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:16,669
take the square root of that and there's
a threshold

483
00:30:16,669 --> 00:30:19,860
and if it's below the threshold its
uniform it's about the threshold

484
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:24,299
its nine

485
00:30:24,299 --> 00:30:27,720
lower frequency components can hide more
bits generally

486
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:30,880
usually larger but

487
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:34,260
there's it because martz toward K

488
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:37,440
high-frequency components have more I'm

489
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:40,490
me he can he can that be the

490
00:30:40,490 --> 00:30:43,760
you cannot hide as many hits in them
because most of them go to zero

491
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:46,820
remember in the lower right hand corner

492
00:30:46,820 --> 00:30:50,980
at the DCT coefficients there's a lot of
zeros

493
00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:54,720
those are the high-frequency components
39 any couple

494
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:59,899
any television it's not zero or one

495
00:30:59,899 --> 00:31:04,789
alright so here's an example where we
have our acquisition table

496
00:31:04,789 --> 00:31:07,929
there's two math calculations done
there's

497
00:31:07,929 --> 00:31:12,010
one calculation done

498
00:31:12,010 --> 00:31:15,880
when calculation done based on this
value in the causation table

499
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:19,210
and one calculation then based on that
value

500
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:23,659
in the actual DCT coefficient and it
says how many bits can I had based on

501
00:31:23,659 --> 00:31:25,269
the value not quite as Asian table

502
00:31:25,269 --> 00:31:28,669
come a bit can I based on the actual DCT
coefficient

503
00:31:28,669 --> 00:31:32,720
and then it takes the smaller of the two
and the smaller of the two

504
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:39,090
is what is the number that they can hide
in there

505
00:31:39,090 --> 00:31:42,570
welt on extraction the extractor has to
be able to determine

506
00:31:42,570 --> 00:31:46,320
which blocks a uniform in which blacks
tonight and he'll

507
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:51,039
altering the coefficients upon
extraction that uniformity measure

508
00:31:51,039 --> 00:31:55,370
by the different so the authors of this
technique

509
00:31:55,370 --> 00:31:59,210
change the quantization table in the
lower right hand corner

510
00:31:59,210 --> 00:32:02,929
which is the highest frequency value to
a wine

511
00:32:02,929 --> 00:32:07,490
and then he's that as an indication
muzak coefficient

512
00:32:07,490 --> 00:32:11,669
as an indication as to whether or not
this black is uniform 94

513
00:32:11,669 --> 00:32:16,019
which I don't like because if you have a
JA can there's a

514
00:32:16,019 --> 00:32:20,080
a whining that valued the quantization
table that's a big red flag

515
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:24,399
as to pay there's something going on
here there's never supposed to be a wine

516
00:32:24,399 --> 00:32:30,200
in at high frequency coefficient
quantization table value

517
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:34,789
so I do something different

518
00:32:34,789 --> 00:32:38,529
I just modified the way the uniformity
was calculated

519
00:32:38,529 --> 00:32:42,169
so that I can use any of the bits that
could be changed

520
00:32:42,169 --> 00:32:46,120
and then I don't have to modify the
causation table so the program that

521
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:49,200
that I'm happy to distribute see all if
you want it

522
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:52,429
I'm will not make any changes to the
quantization table

523
00:32:52,429 --> 00:32:59,240
and will work just as well

524
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:02,929
alright so here's an example the program

525
00:33:02,929 --> 00:33:07,250
puts the parameters in the file named so
that you can extract

526
00:33:07,250 --> 00:33:11,620
because when you extract if you don't
use default parameters

527
00:33:11,620 --> 00:33:16,510
and you have to specify the actual
parameters this program is a very

528
00:33:16,510 --> 00:33:20,320
lab oriented program not a production
program

529
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:24,769
k is designed for engineers in and
people that want to experiment things

530
00:33:24,769 --> 00:33:26,940
like that as opposed to a practical

531
00:33:26,940 --> 00:33:31,919
type application so it does not self
detect oh this is eyeing technique

532
00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:36,580
this is the alpha value this is the
youth value and so forth

533
00:33:36,580 --> 00:33:39,980
for dispersal in the file name so you
can remember so now tho was

534
00:33:39,980 --> 00:33:45,700
8 use eight next business five and
quality was a hundred

535
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:50,299
to find about a capacity of about 25
percent

536
00:33:50,299 --> 00:33:53,559
which is pretty large capacity be able
to hide in their

537
00:33:53,559 --> 00:33:57,559
and very difficult to wells there's
there's a technique to detect it

538
00:33:57,559 --> 00:34:02,340
just show you shortly here's a call you
eighty percent

539
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:06,200
we still had 26 percent in the file
size: hidden still that smaller file

540
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:09,429
size

541
00:34:09,429 --> 00:34:14,230
and I don't know what happened to that
image that does not look like that

542
00:34:14,230 --> 00:34:18,790
to now look like that this morning when
I went to my slide so natok

543
00:34:18,790 --> 00:34:21,919
then there's the Anna

544
00:34:21,919 --> 00:34:24,829
you know that happen to me in class the
other day too I had like a big pink

545
00:34:24,829 --> 00:34:26,940
stripe across the bottom line to the
images

546
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:31,349
in in that so I'm not sure what's going
on Palin I

547
00:34:31,349 --> 00:34:36,070
now that quality 16 well these are not
coming out at all

548
00:34:36,070 --> 00:34:39,700
okay well want to come back to he was
calling

549
00:34:39,700 --> 00:34:43,409
50 you know can you

550
00:34:43,409 --> 00:34:46,919
it's kinda tough to see up on the screen
I I can see it on this monitor

551
00:34:46,919 --> 00:34:51,970
can you see the the dots on the screen
Casey the blocking is

552
00:34:51,970 --> 00:34:57,079
Anna yeah I mean you should be able to
have purposely chose this quality level

553
00:34:57,079 --> 00:34:57,680
2k

554
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:01,780
illustrate that in the top after the
image

555
00:35:01,780 --> 00:35:05,560
I you can see a lot of the the blocking
yes

556
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:09,440
up there and you can see like black dots
and stuff that's not really part of the

557
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,810
regular image

558
00:35:10,810 --> 00:35:16,900
it's much more apparent on a monitor
then it is up on that screen

559
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:21,079
but if you hide cryptographically Calif
use a password

560
00:35:21,079 --> 00:35:24,109
then it spread those dots all over the

561
00:35:24,109 --> 00:35:27,950
image okay so you don't have a
concentrated in the top half

562
00:35:27,950 --> 00:35:31,940
with nothing in the bottom half it
spread all over the entire image

563
00:35:31,940 --> 00:35:36,650
course this quality level was chosen
with the hype Randers high-capacity

564
00:35:36,650 --> 00:35:37,410
primers

565
00:35:37,410 --> 00:35:43,010
in order to carry illustrate that

566
00:35:43,010 --> 00:35:48,950
alright so how do we detect this stuff

567
00:35:48,950 --> 00:35:52,640
well there's three levels a detection
ago three levels a failure i should say

568
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:55,770
for steganography one is detection is
usually the big one

569
00:35:55,770 --> 00:36:00,000
to Zachs traction so some other things
don't complicate detection may

570
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:00,710
complicate

571
00:36:00,710 --> 00:36:04,349
extraction K like cryptography that
makes extract Difco

572
00:36:04,349 --> 00:36:08,630
and the third one is destruction the
turns out destruction is generally

573
00:36:08,630 --> 00:36:12,510
pretty easy for steganography you can
always

574
00:36:12,510 --> 00:36:18,349
just re hide something else on top of
whatever year before

575
00:36:18,349 --> 00:36:21,810
when you look at the papers the
peer-reviewed professional papers

576
00:36:21,810 --> 00:36:26,320
especially for this steganalysis they
trying to complicate the math

577
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:30,400
at another try and press their professor
or impress other people that are reading

578
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:31,270
the paper

579
00:36:31,270 --> 00:36:36,180
may need to post to this for them
expressed as a summation site

580
00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:40,160
okay and that's just a simple example
mean average is expressed as a sum Asian

581
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:40,910
over there

582
00:36:40,910 --> 00:36:44,310
thing with Eagle probable advance in all
this I I don't know

583
00:36:44,310 --> 00:36:47,910
I'm or type practical type got okay

584
00:36:47,910 --> 00:36:50,970
now course add with a meta data size

585
00:36:50,970 --> 00:36:54,910
I matters for detection you know if you
just hired a single bit

586
00:36:54,910 --> 00:36:58,030
it's much harder to detect there and if
you hide

587
00:36:58,030 --> 00:37:02,250
24 capacity the technique

588
00:37:02,250 --> 00:37:06,690
so general approach as much information
as possible

589
00:37:06,690 --> 00:37:12,570
is the key okay what's your adversaries
goal what are they trying to hide

590
00:37:12,570 --> 00:37:16,770
k what are you looking for in other
words what tools do they may be years

591
00:37:16,770 --> 00:37:20,800
what I to cover files are these are
these NJ pages and a map so these in

592
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:24,460
I movie files you know what K

593
00:37:24,460 --> 00:37:28,500
check for tool signature some tools
actually leave the signature like

594
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:32,500
that modified quantization table value
okay or maybe

595
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:38,230
I found out early on that the the code I
used for the J peg program

596
00:37:38,230 --> 00:37:42,700
I'm always embedded a comet in the
header NK with that the title of the

597
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:45,109
book or whatever for the for the code

598
00:37:45,109 --> 00:37:48,420
well that would be a big flag if I J
page with that title

599
00:37:48,420 --> 00:37:51,960
any know that there's a stay in a
graphic program that uses that

600
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:55,510
then as kind of a clear indication right

601
00:37:55,510 --> 00:37:58,900
so but for signatures on

602
00:37:58,900 --> 00:38:03,089
I'm what's your adversaries goal you
know what your goal

603
00:38:03,089 --> 00:38:07,349
detection extraction or destruction K
what tools they use what come files were

604
00:38:07,349 --> 00:38:08,369
tied to messages

605
00:38:08,369 --> 00:38:12,880
texting cryptid compressed other images

606
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:17,270
but for the signatures to mention that
also specific types a distortion

607
00:38:17,270 --> 00:38:22,220
the high-capacity Jay pag please a
blocking is type a distortion when

608
00:38:22,220 --> 00:38:26,210
when he's as lower quality says a very
common type of distortion NJ pague

609
00:38:26,210 --> 00:38:31,150
is that like ms. when you hide it maps
you get like a fuzziness usually

610
00:38:31,150 --> 00:38:35,980
that NJ takes to get a blackness

611
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:41,410
so two general approaches for Jay thanks
one is to look at the DCT coefficients

612
00:38:41,410 --> 00:38:45,000
and the program has a capability I'll
show you that

613
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:48,960
and then the other one is to you
actually check the balky miss

614
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:53,599
the image itself and I'm talking about
mathematically taking the black as night

615
00:38:53,599 --> 00:38:56,640
you know a poor person taking the
blackness

616
00:38:56,640 --> 00:39:00,220
some the techniques real and training
are you taking a ten thousand get images

617
00:39:00,220 --> 00:39:02,250
running through get statistics

618
00:39:02,250 --> 00:39:06,869
and then look for deviations from those
statistics they don't make set

619
00:39:06,869 --> 00:39:11,180
the chi-square test is a statistical tie
test is used quite frequently

620
00:39:11,180 --> 00:39:15,349
I'm to detect Stephens apex

621
00:39:15,349 --> 00:39:19,900
basic histograms at the J pic filed do
not work very well

622
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:23,380
which one has a hidden data okay

623
00:39:23,380 --> 00:39:26,770
a histogram say no histograms account

624
00:39:26,770 --> 00:39:30,829
different by valujet's so overhears a
counter 0

625
00:39:30,829 --> 00:39:34,190
which is right there here's a counter
128

626
00:39:34,190 --> 00:39:38,430
his account 3055 and everything in
between

627
00:39:38,430 --> 00:39:41,599
okay that's what it has a histogram its
so in a compressed

628
00:39:41,599 --> 00:39:44,900
J take file during his together the
files

629
00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:48,770
pretty worthless then you can identify
that it's a compressed file by the

630
00:39:48,770 --> 00:39:49,369
histogram

631
00:39:49,369 --> 00:39:53,430
because you don't know even what the
file is d it has any say oh it's a

632
00:39:53,430 --> 00:39:54,740
compressed file

633
00:39:54,740 --> 00:39:58,960
then you can tell anything about hidden
data

634
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:02,980
however ended natural Jake file

635
00:40:02,980 --> 00:40:06,319
the DCT coefficients are generally
balanced

636
00:40:06,319 --> 00:40:09,890
there's roughly the same proportion up
positive winds

637
00:40:09,890 --> 00:40:13,270
as there are negative point positive to
use

638
00:40:13,270 --> 00:40:17,579
negative tease positive threes negative
the race and so forth

639
00:40:17,579 --> 00:40:21,319
and when we substituted we any 01

640
00:40:21,319 --> 00:40:24,790
K and when he says it into a positive to

641
00:40:24,790 --> 00:40:29,440
that changes to a3 and we substituted in
0 positive three that changes to it is

642
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:30,480
or swapping

643
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:34,670
between two and three when we change the
least significant bit

644
00:40:34,670 --> 00:40:38,540
on the negative side native one becomes
native to

645
00:40:38,540 --> 00:40:42,869
in negative to become statewide so when
we were randomly

646
00:40:42,869 --> 00:40:48,150
hide in both positive and negative DCT
coefficients

647
00:40:48,150 --> 00:40:52,150
then we upset the balance them

648
00:40:52,150 --> 00:40:55,599
f5 does not upset the balance

649
00:40:55,599 --> 00:41:00,700
because it just the tracks K -1 goes to
zero and it's not use Paswan just as

650
00:41:00,700 --> 00:41:02,950
Iran is not used

651
00:41:02,950 --> 00:41:07,339
native two dozen a tip line positive
goes to positive one

652
00:41:07,339 --> 00:41:10,710
so f 5 maintains a pallet

653
00:41:10,710 --> 00:41:14,380
in a course the swapping out with them
doesn't change any of the DCT

654
00:41:14,380 --> 00:41:16,119
coefficients at all

655
00:41:16,119 --> 00:41:20,440
you get the same look at the DCT
coefficients before you hide as you do

656
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:24,380
ashey hide so so looking at the DCT
coefficients ballots

657
00:41:24,380 --> 00:41:27,950
for the swapping out with them doesn't
do anything

658
00:41:27,950 --> 00:41:32,119
as we have to look at the blocking it

659
00:41:32,119 --> 00:41:37,560
so here's an image I they have size
about 460 K

660
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:42,109
call the 75 hello and alpha values a
little bit on this one

661
00:41:42,109 --> 00:41:46,369
and is about 18 percent at the filesize

662
00:41:46,369 --> 00:41:50,829
I'm is that available for hiding and I
used about that

663
00:41:50,829 --> 00:41:54,030
9 percent total only is about half the
available

664
00:41:54,030 --> 00:41:57,040
hiding in this particular image

665
00:41:57,040 --> 00:42:04,040
so here's a histogram the DCT
coefficients b four

666
00:42:04,210 --> 00:42:07,319
so one in the middle is zero

667
00:42:07,319 --> 00:42:10,490
and with 0 it's off the charts

668
00:42:10,490 --> 00:42:15,819
I mean it its it's so much higher that I
didn't even use 02 scale

669
00:42:15,819 --> 00:42:20,230
the coefficient mean that's the point OJ
is to get appointed zero coefficients L

670
00:42:20,230 --> 00:42:23,540
so there's like five billion 0 patience
and the others like twenty thirty

671
00:42:23,540 --> 00:42:25,319
thousand or something like that

672
00:42:25,319 --> 00:42:29,400
okay in the program does produce this
and it also produces a text to a file

673
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:30,180
with the

674
00:42:30,180 --> 00:42:35,250
actual if that counts you can see so the
green there represents

675
00:42:35,250 --> 00:42:39,119
on the left -1 as I wish I had steady
hands

676
00:42:39,119 --> 00:42:42,140
and on the right represent a positive

677
00:42:42,140 --> 00:42:46,300
K and then to the left of the green as
well red

678
00:42:46,300 --> 00:42:50,160
as the negative to count and to the
right as a positive can

679
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:53,790
threats are the colors kinda matchup so
easy to see

680
00:42:53,790 --> 00:42:56,859
power comparing positive one data point

681
00:42:56,859 --> 00:43:01,010
positive negative and so forth and just
looking at that you can see it's fairly

682
00:43:01,010 --> 00:43:05,020
symmetrical

683
00:43:05,020 --> 00:43:08,190
well there's a line with the in dade

684
00:43:08,190 --> 00:43:11,990
now that's clearly not symmetrical very
very different

685
00:43:11,990 --> 00:43:15,390
right now as a human

686
00:43:15,390 --> 00:43:19,040
that's pretty easy to look at go out
it's really a balanced

687
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:23,040
as a compere it's actually little bit
more difficult

688
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:27,810
I where you try to analyze the numbers
and and come up with a threshold it says

689
00:43:27,810 --> 00:43:31,329
yeah this isn't balanced this is not
because the numbers I like that

690
00:43:31,329 --> 00:43:37,790
the exact equal but it can be dead

691
00:43:37,790 --> 00:43:41,770
this is after hiding with the LSP
technique but the last thing

692
00:43:41,770 --> 00:43:45,470
the last summer's after hiding with the
high-capacity technique

693
00:43:45,470 --> 00:43:48,920
and this was after riding with the
allies the technique head still

694
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:50,790
unbalanced

695
00:43:50,790 --> 00:43:54,530
this was after wiping K one other
features the program's

696
00:43:54,530 --> 00:43:57,630
big because again it's just an
experimental type program

697
00:43:57,630 --> 00:44:01,050
is that you can set all the message bits
20

698
00:44:01,050 --> 00:44:05,990
and as call that wiping the message well
clearly with the DCT coefficients if you

699
00:44:05,990 --> 00:44:07,510
wipe anything

700
00:44:07,510 --> 00:44:11,990
through the obvious and then there's a a
random function also that just randomize

701
00:44:11,990 --> 00:44:12,329
is

702
00:44:12,329 --> 00:44:15,960
all the message bits with as the
pseudo-random number generator

703
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:19,819
and still very unbalanced K

704
00:44:19,819 --> 00:44:23,180
incidentally when you randomized the
message

705
00:44:23,180 --> 00:44:26,849
that's a pretty good simulation at
hiding an encrypted file

706
00:44:26,849 --> 00:44:30,450
an encrypted file is going to look
extremely random

707
00:44:30,450 --> 00:44:33,869
and so the randomization feature here's
a good simulation have

708
00:44:33,869 --> 00:44:37,569
hiding something that's been created so
you when you're hiding you can even tell

709
00:44:37,569 --> 00:44:39,650
a maybe I'm hiding something in cryptid

710
00:44:39,650 --> 00:44:45,690
verses something else based on the
television distribution

711
00:44:45,690 --> 00:44:49,589
either the actual numbers at this point
out that the zero count

712
00:44:49,589 --> 00:44:53,589
like 90 when ninety-two percent up the
entire count

713
00:44:53,589 --> 00:44:57,480
like five million compared to the other
so it's it's way out there

714
00:44:57,480 --> 00:45:02,270
Corso f5 make says 0 count higher

715
00:45:02,270 --> 00:45:05,349
but is still very high so

716
00:45:05,349 --> 00:45:11,349
it's difficult to detect f5 I just say
no there's too many zeros

717
00:45:11,349 --> 00:45:14,859
now I guess that use the excess capacity

718
00:45:14,859 --> 00:45:19,790
to readjust the coefficients to try to
rebalance them

719
00:45:19,790 --> 00:45:23,540
gay saw the city as I mentioned as a
change in the coefficients

720
00:45:23,540 --> 00:45:27,670
f5 subtracts it doesn't substitute so it
keeps the ballot

721
00:45:27,670 --> 00:45:32,010
so we need another technique to detect
JAXA use that

722
00:45:32,010 --> 00:45:36,780
those types as a hiding approaches

723
00:45:36,780 --> 00:45:40,560
a I tend to get ahead of myself I don't
like to read slides

724
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:44,160
so I know that all you can read

725
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:47,359
see is a technique for detecting f5

726
00:45:47,359 --> 00:45:52,109
in this is a very brief overview you
want the details there's a paper on it

727
00:45:52,109 --> 00:45:56,210
decompress the image in crop it by four
columns

728
00:45:56,210 --> 00:45:59,660
and now we get it estimate than the
original image by that

729
00:45:59,660 --> 00:46:04,000
okay and all the hiding is lost that
when you cross the tape a given by one

730
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:05,579
column or or wind

731
00:46:05,579 --> 00:46:10,450
horizontal row you're totally change the
DCT coefficients

732
00:46:10,450 --> 00:46:14,150
so if you're wondering hey does this
have a message in your chart the

733
00:46:14,150 --> 00:46:17,670
messages you just gotta make sure that
the message doesn't get through

734
00:46:17,670 --> 00:46:21,390
to scrap it and the guy

735
00:46:21,390 --> 00:46:25,089
K so about that at all clio a blurring
out for them

736
00:46:25,089 --> 00:46:29,290
and then it compares the predicted
histogram with the stale histogram

737
00:46:29,290 --> 00:46:32,510
and is able to actually calculate the
message like

738
00:46:32,510 --> 00:46:37,369
for the price and it messes like from
that

739
00:46:37,369 --> 00:46:41,980
here's the blocking as I was talking
about so this is just illustrating where

740
00:46:41,980 --> 00:46:45,910
where am more ply this formula which
also looks really ugly

741
00:46:45,910 --> 00:46:49,609
the really all its doing is getting the
difference along that vertical

742
00:46:49,609 --> 00:46:52,930
column there's a difference long-dead
vertical column different alignment

743
00:46:52,930 --> 00:46:54,020
horizontal

744
00:46:54,020 --> 00:46:58,230
row the defense line that horizontal row
in kinda measuring them

745
00:46:58,230 --> 00:47:01,880
if you have a natural J take that
doesn't have anything hidden

746
00:47:01,880 --> 00:47:05,240
then those differences should be pretty
small because it's gonna look smooth me

747
00:47:05,240 --> 00:47:06,690
it looks good he saw the

748
00:47:06,690 --> 00:47:09,970
pictures and in the demo data pretty
high

749
00:47:09,970 --> 00:47:14,619
at resolution image in a look at that
solution the much blocking its

750
00:47:14,619 --> 00:47:18,730
K but if you hide stuff you get his
likeness even if we can't see the

751
00:47:18,730 --> 00:47:19,740
blackness

752
00:47:19,740 --> 00:47:25,700
you can detect a certain amount like
anise with that

753
00:47:25,700 --> 00:47:29,460
they got about that five-minute the
Capri close here

754
00:47:29,460 --> 00:47:32,750
okay I'm

755
00:47:32,750 --> 00:47:35,930
again extraction is more difficult
because people

756
00:47:35,930 --> 00:47:39,240
complicate extraction by using
encryption techniques or viper meeting

757
00:47:39,240 --> 00:47:40,349
the message

758
00:47:40,349 --> 00:47:44,190
and knowing the method is critical I if
you know if you're looking for SWAT

759
00:47:44,190 --> 00:47:47,030
coefficients and it's in the LSP or vice
versa

760
00:47:47,030 --> 00:47:50,300
stuff to find the message I

761
00:47:50,300 --> 00:47:53,720
by talked about the sterilization
already as far as randomizing the

762
00:47:53,720 --> 00:47:54,559
staffer

763
00:47:54,559 --> 00:47:57,970
resizing the image are cropping the
image that's all very good for

764
00:47:57,970 --> 00:48:00,730
destroying the message

765
00:48:00,730 --> 00:48:07,730
alright

766
00:48:09,740 --> 00:48:15,860
so here's my command window and that's
the way to signing up their own

767
00:48:15,860 --> 00:48:19,480
a folder so

768
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:24,740
just to prove to you that this actually
does work as anybody can stand up here

769
00:48:24,740 --> 00:48:26,410
and say anything right that it works

770
00:48:26,410 --> 00:48:29,420
and I did the and it's got that out a
little bit

771
00:48:29,420 --> 00:48:33,240
just two save time

772
00:48:33,240 --> 00:48:36,640
so there's the command line

773
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:40,060
now this command line is gonna tell it
to hide

774
00:48:40,060 --> 00:48:44,070
the default algorithm is the
high-capacity he can specify couple the

775
00:48:44,070 --> 00:48:44,990
other algorithms

776
00:48:44,990 --> 00:48:48,040
with the program I'm going to hyannis
cat image

777
00:48:48,040 --> 00:48:51,730
this guy had a PowerPoint so I was
actually gonna hide this presentation

778
00:48:51,730 --> 00:48:55,330
but the presentations to our site I
kinda down some was a part of the

779
00:48:55,330 --> 00:48:56,140
presentation

780
00:48:56,140 --> 00:48:59,720
call the 100 now say you ate and

781
00:48:59,720 --> 00:49:04,200
and it's also going to collect
statistics and create those

782
00:49:04,200 --> 00:49:11,200
PCT histograms 0842

783
00:49:11,470 --> 00:49:15,450
finish their this is a fairly large file

784
00:49:15,450 --> 00:49:19,660
for take the second time at like nine
they got me out but I

785
00:49:19,660 --> 00:49:23,940
so here's the storage capacity I don't
know how well that shows up

786
00:49:23,940 --> 00:49:28,520
on the monitor know that not too bad at
one point eight megabytes

787
00:49:28,520 --> 00:49:33,390
and then a bunch of other information
and here

788
00:49:33,390 --> 00:49:37,300
is now sorry

789
00:49:37,300 --> 00:49:43,110
saw their ice cream here we go

790
00:49:43,110 --> 00:49:46,440
there's the image with the hidden data

791
00:49:46,440 --> 00:49:50,800
and we can really seeing it on this one
this was a high-quality

792
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:56,920
they pay that's me right there

793
00:49:56,920 --> 00:50:01,560
taking the picture you see any
distortion and then

794
00:50:01,560 --> 00:50:05,540
and the CEO's the both the statistics on
that

795
00:50:05,540 --> 00:50:09,570
now the about 1.8 a megabyte so

796
00:50:09,570 --> 00:50:13,840
18 percent of that file is my data

797
00:50:13,840 --> 00:50:19,120
okay night that day all right let's look
at the histograms here

798
00:50:19,120 --> 00:50:22,270
so here's the DCT before

799
00:50:22,270 --> 00:50:27,080
looks pretty balanced now this is a
pretty large file so

800
00:50:27,080 --> 00:50:30,690
so the numbers are still not perfectly
even

801
00:50:30,690 --> 00:50:34,100
but in this grass because the grass is
very limited

802
00:50:34,100 --> 00:50:37,530
and they're so close now they're closing
out that they look perfectly even in

803
00:50:37,530 --> 00:50:37,930
that

804
00:50:37,930 --> 00:50:42,450
and then after

805
00:50:42,450 --> 00:50:46,100
so there's a clear indication after

806
00:50:46,100 --> 00:50:49,720
that there some alter data there for
that there's something

807
00:50:49,720 --> 00:50:56,720
unusual about that particular image
alright so you still don't believe me

808
00:50:58,580 --> 00:51:02,880
because I have extracted the message yet
well here's the message

809
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:06,330
so this is this not extracted is what I
actually put in there

810
00:51:06,330 --> 00:51:11,350
and that's just dumb I said a truncated
version of this

811
00:51:11,350 --> 00:51:15,560
presentation in K so let's do the

812
00:51:15,560 --> 00:51:21,490
to the extraction so for extraction

813
00:51:21,490 --> 00:51:25,260
he just uses the command word extract

814
00:51:25,260 --> 00:51:29,030
and what'd

815
00:51:29,030 --> 00:51:34,190
our okay on a forget to press Control
see

816
00:51:34,190 --> 00:51:37,700
rose again area

817
00:51:37,700 --> 00:51:42,190
and you have to give it the same alpha
values in the same you value

818
00:51:42,190 --> 00:51:45,480
you know nothing about the quality
because the quality all that does is the

819
00:51:45,480 --> 00:51:47,080
just the quantization table

820
00:51:47,080 --> 00:51:50,250
and the quantization table is built into
the day takes oath

821
00:51:50,250 --> 00:51:53,450
so the feast day go ImageJ pay

822
00:51:53,450 --> 00:51:57,860
as the quality in there that the
quantization table in there alright

823
00:51:57,860 --> 00:52:03,970
so I'll send it off to work there

824
00:52:03,970 --> 00:52:07,350
oh and then this is the hidden cat image
right there

825
00:52:07,350 --> 00:52:11,860
idk at okay all done

826
00:52:11,860 --> 00:52:15,210
and here's the extracted

827
00:52:15,210 --> 00:52:19,000
PowerPoint file why we should appeared
over here

828
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:22,890
she tried again cuz you're right now
that's the one the justice Chaudhry

829
00:52:22,890 --> 00:52:27,880
now it's just a period just appearing
over here when I double click it

830
00:52:27,880 --> 00:52:31,220
this article anyway that is the one

831
00:52:31,220 --> 00:52:34,270
okay so the truncated version at the

832
00:52:34,270 --> 00:52:37,680
the presentation alright

833
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:41,790
if they have any questions on that

834
00:52:41,790 --> 00:52:48,020
have a couple more demos so this one

835
00:52:48,020 --> 00:52:54,700
and he's a call the other 30 percent

836
00:52:54,700 --> 00:52:57,830
and a high and the the dog so there's a
a

837
00:52:57,830 --> 00:53:01,200
dog picture on here using

838
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:07,460
right there okay there's a much smaller
file so this will happen faster

839
00:53:07,460 --> 00:53:11,390
and I'm deciding this little text
message in there see two da text

840
00:53:11,390 --> 00:53:14,920
they can take a look at that the

841
00:53:14,920 --> 00:53:21,510
where is it areas

842
00:53:21,510 --> 00:53:28,370
alright so that's what I'm hiding in
there

843
00:53:28,370 --> 00:53:32,790
okay are done and

844
00:53:32,790 --> 00:53:36,470
here's the one the hidden message

845
00:53:36,470 --> 00:53:40,430
so this one was done at a quality a
fifty-percent

846
00:53:40,430 --> 00:53:44,370
with the high alpha value and high
uniformity value and so you can clearly

847
00:53:44,370 --> 00:53:45,180
see

848
00:53:45,180 --> 00:53:49,310
there's something wrong with that image
by

849
00:53:49,310 --> 00:53:52,780
met I did this one I am

850
00:53:52,780 --> 00:53:56,870
just to show you can still extract a
message okay so if you don't care

851
00:53:56,870 --> 00:54:00,000
historic track the message

852
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:03,330
so we'll do that it's very fast

853
00:54:03,330 --> 00:54:07,250
and there's the extracted message

854
00:54:07,250 --> 00:54:11,280
so same text message K one more real
quick

855
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:16,510
this time we're gonna do basically the
same thing

856
00:54:16,510 --> 00:54:21,230
except I use a password

857
00:54:21,230 --> 00:54:25,020
and the password is black cat

858
00:54:25,020 --> 00:54:29,580
and they had hear that

859
00:54:29,580 --> 00:54:35,400
him that the hidden file I'm with the
password is created

860
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:39,480
okay NEC have it spread out over the
entire image

861
00:54:39,480 --> 00:54:43,770
from that and then if you use the long
password

862
00:54:43,770 --> 00:54:47,780
for extraction thanks a lease the

863
00:54:47,780 --> 00:54:51,160
these the word black cat

864
00:54:51,160 --> 00:54:57,360
instead

865
00:54:57,360 --> 00:55:02,050
message entire message not extracted the
reason that happens is because I am bed

866
00:55:02,050 --> 00:55:03,220
the link to the message

867
00:55:03,220 --> 00:55:06,690
in there and they see this is the
extracted data

868
00:55:06,690 --> 00:55:09,970
but it doesn't like anything like a text
file

869
00:55:09,970 --> 00:55:13,040
cases dog random an unguarded

870
00:55:13,040 --> 00:55:19,940
but if he is the correct password which
was black hat

871
00:55:19,940 --> 00:55:24,610
and then extract

872
00:55:24,610 --> 00:55:28,430
then you got the right message I will
mention that

873
00:55:28,430 --> 00:55:34,230
in this implementation I limited the the
effect as the password 256 bits just

874
00:55:34,230 --> 00:55:37,690
I and want to take any chance on
violating

875
00:55:37,690 --> 00:55:40,810
tighter regulations or something I mean
I don't think it would but

876
00:55:40,810 --> 00:55:44,860
but just to be on the safe side I don't
wanna go back home in

877
00:55:44,860 --> 00:55:48,750
gets thrown in jail or anything said
anyway that's it

878
00:55:48,750 --> 00:55:55,750
as I have anybody have any questions yes

879
00:56:05,970 --> 00:56:11,280
with the sample it up and then sample to
back down right

880
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:16,320
is

881
00:56:16,320 --> 00:56:22,860
is that gonna destroy the message well
now you will not be able to recover the

882
00:56:22,860 --> 00:56:25,160
messages that point that you are Liz

883
00:56:25,160 --> 00:56:30,570
your data when you do that now with
steganography is is very sensitive to

884
00:56:30,570 --> 00:56:31,130
change

885
00:56:31,130 --> 00:56:34,650
at the Oak on watermarking I allows more

886
00:56:34,650 --> 00:56:38,460
changes in the goal a watermarking is to
allow you to make manipulations like

887
00:56:38,460 --> 00:56:38,810
that

888
00:56:38,810 --> 00:56:42,730
and preserve the message but the
capacity is much much smaller

889
00:56:42,730 --> 00:56:46,230
there's one watermarking technique you
can rotate it you can scale it you can

890
00:56:46,230 --> 00:56:47,250
do all kinda stuff

891
00:56:47,250 --> 00:56:50,580
and the watermark is still there they
only had one day

892
00:56:50,580 --> 00:56:54,360
in K so this kind this trade-off between
capacity

893
00:56:54,360 --> 00:56:58,330
and robustness I'm robustness named more
manipulation you can do

894
00:56:58,330 --> 00:57:01,470
so there may exist some techniques that
would allow you to do that

895
00:57:01,470 --> 00:57:04,720
but it's going to be a much smaller
capacity they would have with

896
00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:08,260
but a pic so with mistake and I see you
trying to maximize capacity

897
00:57:08,260 --> 00:57:13,140
and and so you have a a you know as
MySpace it possibly get

898
00:57:13,140 --> 00:57:17,420
any little change or destroy it other
questions

899
00:57:17,420 --> 00:57:24,420
up okay

900
00:57:29,570 --> 00:57:33,900
I'm and now there's a there's a lotta
different pieces a software out there

901
00:57:33,900 --> 00:57:38,410
this one on the right now it does the
swapping does the least significant bit

902
00:57:38,410 --> 00:57:40,250
had as a high-capacity I mean

903
00:57:40,250 --> 00:57:44,160
there's one more technical and I had it
I'd like to add a f5 tie technique but

904
00:57:44,160 --> 00:57:45,200
it's not in there yet

905
00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:49,330
but yeah there's a buncha is either stay
all programs easy stay go

906
00:57:49,330 --> 00:57:53,260
NJ stag that I didn't a page as well but
there's no other one that

907
00:57:53,260 --> 00:57:57,090
implements the high-capacity technique
to my knowledge but yeah there's no all

908
00:57:57,090 --> 00:57:59,170
in one there's there's someone there's
100 so I'll

909
00:57:59,170 --> 00:58:02,600
think another company documented about
thirteen or fourteen hundred different

910
00:58:02,600 --> 00:58:03,370
programs

911
00:58:03,370 --> 00:58:10,370
your question

912
00:58:16,640 --> 00:58:19,540
I'm not sure exactly what standards here

913
00:58:19,540 --> 00:58:22,660
you talk about their there is a
jailbreak 2000 standard

914
00:58:22,660 --> 00:58:26,589
okay which came out around 2,000 then
nobody's using

915
00:58:26,589 --> 00:58:31,180
I'm that one actually uses the discrete
wavelet transform

916
00:58:31,180 --> 00:58:35,230
so he might be able to apply similar
concept

917
00:58:35,230 --> 00:58:38,700
not but I'm not really sure because I
worked with that the wavelet that much

918
00:58:38,700 --> 00:58:40,119
I'm not that knowledgeable on that

919
00:58:40,119 --> 00:58:44,900
on and then there is a lossless J pay
there's no reason why you can apply the

920
00:58:44,900 --> 00:58:45,890
concept to that

921
00:58:45,890 --> 00:58:49,609
either okay

922
00:58:49,609 --> 00:58:56,609
yes

923
00:58:57,150 --> 00:59:01,450
well if trying to figure out what to
order using you try to figure out what

924
00:59:01,450 --> 00:59:02,270
they're hiding

925
00:59:02,270 --> 00:59:06,470
and then one thing you can do is say
well let's just extract as if they used

926
00:59:06,470 --> 00:59:07,500
LSD

927
00:59:07,500 --> 00:59:11,859
and let's look at the result let's
extracted stays high capacity

928
00:59:11,859 --> 00:59:15,500
now you know high-capacity technique
let's look at the results let's do this

929
00:59:15,500 --> 00:59:16,550
while coefficients

930
00:59:16,550 --> 00:59:20,180
look at the results so you can do kinda
brute force

931
00:59:20,180 --> 00:59:23,250
typeof thing to try to extract the data

932
00:59:23,250 --> 00:59:27,349
but the and know that I know when the
technique is very important because then

933
00:59:27,349 --> 00:59:28,430
you can narrow it down

934
00:59:28,430 --> 00:59:31,900
okay I'm if you just have a file and say
here

935
00:59:31,900 --> 00:59:34,599
there might be something hidden in there
you don't even know if there's a message

936
00:59:34,599 --> 00:59:35,380
in there and I

937
00:59:35,380 --> 00:59:39,260
you gotta do a lot announces this from
this as well here's a file

938
00:59:39,260 --> 00:59:43,290
and we know these this program to do it
that makes it a lot easier

939
00:59:43,290 --> 00:59:47,490
so if there's no silver bullet to
extracting the data

940
00:59:47,490 --> 00:59:51,890
if you're if you're the forensic
examiner are you try stuff

941
00:59:51,890 --> 00:59:55,170
try to learn as much about what they're
doing what they're hiding

942
00:59:55,170 --> 01:00:02,170
I'm as possible okay

943
01:00:04,650 --> 01:00:08,670
now well not kinda depends on
computational power someone if you can

944
01:00:08,670 --> 01:00:13,359
you gonna do a lot of this they may be
right up a program that automatically

945
01:00:13,359 --> 01:00:17,550
do all the steps itself produce all the
result in statistically analyze the

946
01:00:17,550 --> 01:00:19,440
results and see which ones look like

947
01:00:19,440 --> 01:00:23,490
I what you're looking for I get their
hiring techs text is very

948
01:00:23,490 --> 01:00:27,510
and set statistical characteristics
should and does this result looks like

949
01:00:27,510 --> 01:00:28,080
text

950
01:00:28,080 --> 01:00:32,430
to this result i texting you cannot make
that so dennis is a matter how fast your

951
01:00:32,430 --> 01:00:33,520
computer is

952
01:00:33,520 --> 01:00:37,020
and that the more you can narrow down
the last time

953
01:00:37,020 --> 01:00:41,010
the generally I'm it's a long process if
you just have a file in say

954
01:00:41,010 --> 01:00:48,010
see if there's something in there yep

955
01:00:56,980 --> 01:01:00,600
I have I did do some research on that
for the class

956
01:01:00,600 --> 01:01:06,010
I'm and actually is doesn't necessarily
imply lower demand exam I just imply a

957
01:01:06,010 --> 01:01:07,170
lot of hobbyists

958
01:01:07,170 --> 01:01:11,000
you know I like to write programs I mean
not all of them are available

959
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:14,920
that you know we can just go download
them but the company that I'm referring

960
01:01:14,920 --> 01:01:15,470
to

961
01:01:15,470 --> 01:01:19,600
they made a business try to collect as
many as possible I am

962
01:01:19,600 --> 01:01:22,890
but to get more tear their point on that

963
01:01:22,890 --> 01:01:27,620
um I'm sorry well was it the

964
01:01:27,620 --> 01:01:32,200
pose the question oh yeah

965
01:01:32,200 --> 01:01:36,550
so I found there was a about a half a
dozen

966
01:01:36,550 --> 01:01:40,220
malware programs that you stay in it.
zoos

967
01:01:40,220 --> 01:01:44,820
deliver on this one shady rat was a very
sophisticated

968
01:01:44,820 --> 01:01:49,810
piece of malware that was very targeted
I'm to actual corporate espionage

969
01:01:49,810 --> 01:01:54,250
K and a couple others I don't recall the
name of the top my head

970
01:01:54,250 --> 01:01:57,930
I read in the paper I one story about

971
01:01:57,930 --> 01:02:01,320
they found a video of Terra Terra said a
video I made

972
01:02:01,320 --> 01:02:04,730
managed to discover that there is some
hidden information in there

973
01:02:04,730 --> 01:02:08,080
some hidden text documents and stuff I
and then

974
01:02:08,080 --> 01:02:12,240
there is another instance a few years
back where Russian spies were

975
01:02:12,240 --> 01:02:16,270
posting images to a website somewhere
then

976
01:02:16,270 --> 01:02:18,830
and there you know it or something is
causing images and then the spies the

977
01:02:18,830 --> 01:02:19,770
download the image

978
01:02:19,770 --> 01:02:23,310
run a little stay a lower them and
extract the data

979
01:02:23,310 --> 01:02:26,840
in the way they found that they didn't
find it because you know they're looking

980
01:02:26,840 --> 01:02:27,680
at the images

981
01:02:27,680 --> 01:02:30,690
they had apparently captured wanted the
spies

982
01:02:30,690 --> 01:02:34,950
computers and then noticed on the
computer that had this program

983
01:02:34,950 --> 01:02:38,790
so what's this I'll look it hides data a
look at extract data

984
01:02:38,790 --> 01:02:42,700
a look they've been to these web sites
look these web sites have pictures on a

985
01:02:42,700 --> 01:02:46,810
so they had ninety percent of the
knowledge already in it said to play

986
01:02:46,810 --> 01:02:49,370
with it I don't know how long it took to
get your point

987
01:02:49,370 --> 01:02:53,160
I they had a whole much information we
have the tools

988
01:02:53,160 --> 01:02:56,550
we have the images that have been dated
out

989
01:02:56,550 --> 01:03:00,200
and so it's much more quicker to find
something that case then

990
01:03:00,200 --> 01:03:05,440
so here's an image see if you can find
anything the questions

991
01:03:05,440 --> 01:03:11,700
you're welcome to ask me questions
afterwards you are going to email me on

992
01:03:11,700 --> 01:03:12,150
the

993
01:03:12,150 --> 01:03:18,120
the email address the Stadio SATX RR dot
com is the preferred address

994
01:03:18,120 --> 01:03:21,650
but I'll respond on the other one as
well so thank you very much
