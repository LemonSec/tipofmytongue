1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:06,170
I am I'll another I am from Spain

2
00:00:06,170 --> 00:00:09,790
I'll I think all you know Spain

3
00:00:09,790 --> 00:00:13,049
or we're fighting on and I'll see an

4
00:00:13,049 --> 00:00:19,140
Barcelona much Sun the scenes I am

5
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:22,390
as a good they're such as since a lot of
paying

6
00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:25,470
as I said i'm too old

7
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:28,609
and Esther

8
00:00:28,609 --> 00:00:32,189
I it's an investigator I

9
00:00:32,189 --> 00:00:35,280
security researcher II

10
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:41,969
in my job on also my free time some a
whole week I aim

11
00:00:41,969 --> 00:00:45,399
always out there office the site

12
00:00:45,399 --> 00:00:48,950
I mean I always attack came nigh

13
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:53,160
being always breaking things I'll

14
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:58,250
why because I think it's better to all

15
00:00:58,250 --> 00:01:01,600
to investigate at two attacks

16
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:05,890
to know footer attacks I had to have I

17
00:01:05,890 --> 00:01:09,850
better protections to our customers

18
00:01:09,850 --> 00:01:14,640
a frame speaking from a company I know

19
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:18,790
um also I am now no level that I

20
00:01:18,790 --> 00:01:23,900
I like air the last no let up but the
call never properly

21
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:27,780
I always start you know out no work in
scenes

22
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:31,329
I have percent it's also I am NOT

23
00:01:31,329 --> 00:01:33,430
at another car

24
00:01:33,430 --> 00:01:36,280
compress outset tax cuts

25
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:43,280
a political levels

26
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:47,290
I'm this I'll the stock is some votes

27
00:01:47,290 --> 00:01:50,380
how to exploit up but the sprites

28
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:57,230
chains in DNS errors wipe

29
00:01:57,230 --> 00:02:00,390
as something and go I use 32

30
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:04,790
it investigates at to attack 2001 of our
customers

31
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:08,250
I it was her I telecom company

32
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:11,490
on their they have

33
00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:14,690
I a lot of us there or there's Oct

34
00:02:14,690 --> 00:02:20,290
with a DNS change as is that moment was

35
00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:23,820
a berwick a back I'll to that moment

36
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:26,910
as this started to appear the

37
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:30,180
meals about this kind of attacks

38
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:33,610
I'll that that case that they too

39
00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:37,459
to investigate this one up dis attacks
that solar company

40
00:02:37,459 --> 00:02:40,780
police a we didn't the

41
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:45,910
we a STEMI taken PSU only so are

42
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:49,510
really so obtuse to my and

43
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:53,080
the I started to see the

44
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:59,400
a from many many many of these attacks

45
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:03,330
in mobile always 18 I facing

46
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:07,390
fisher's I'll

47
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:10,600
and this time that's the routers

48
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:13,940
the 100 S I

49
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:18,390
barry a from I'll

50
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:21,500
a very ECU objective to crack

51
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:24,750
so the DMS worth

52
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:26,500
a study to us the

53
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:27,380
first a

54
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:30,540
am dipping my ability also

55
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:34,060
the are all their ways to change in as
servers

56
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:38,100
for example the last one only for 20
minutes

57
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:41,290
what the no Idec

58
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:45,560
%uh the DNS setup Google and South
America

59
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:49,020
at it was only the 20 minutes but

60
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:52,430
in 20 minutes if you control or

61
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:55,860
this DNS that a everybody

62
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:59,210
knows the IP address on his brace it
above

63
00:03:59,210 --> 00:04:02,960
the to go for your dates in a computer a

64
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:06,120
all I think you can kites

65
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:13,120
other information why did these attacks
are possible

66
00:04:13,370 --> 00:04:16,520
is because

67
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:19,730
there are a lot of whenever it is that's

68
00:04:19,730 --> 00:04:23,450
is a arm phoned its

69
00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:27,020
personally a in this routers

70
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:30,780
I stack overflows missus

71
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:34,250
from pro ya of decision 14 this year

72
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:39,080
one more tho I also

73
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:43,130
a CSR CSRF I think

74
00:04:43,130 --> 00:04:46,630
all the route is a half how did it of

75
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:49,650
CSR RF a test no

76
00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:53,670
not all only a light box up orange in
Europe

77
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:57,840
what's the unique rotator without

78
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:01,490
dissimilarity I all their

79
00:05:01,490 --> 00:05:04,990
the other whenever it is

80
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:09,520
can be the FTP I'll

81
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:13,720
the boots as a backdoor nice not about
various

82
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:16,800
it was very common in the past an

83
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:20,990
nowadays still days the

84
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:26,670
some many factors that are you still I
use this protocol

85
00:05:26,670 --> 00:05:30,890
I also I'll the

86
00:05:30,890 --> 00:05:34,890
DDS its 0 phone om

87
00:05:34,890 --> 00:05:38,540
about door not Dell Inc a computer

88
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:42,160
they are also now it is income trent

89
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:46,810
that done to do enough a

90
00:05:46,810 --> 00:05:51,060
check of their dedication and and you
can get the bus were

91
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:54,880
up that a lot of banalities but

92
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:58,740
them mainland ality they mean but every
day in

93
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:03,340
are ruthless in the and ninety percent
of their

94
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:07,260
houses we r talking notable company

95
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:10,770
at companies we are talking about hop
people than

96
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:14,800
his house is but

97
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:18,360
much worse but by the worst they fought
back or

98
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:23,010
ninety percent of the people wanting the
pile of his router

99
00:06:23,010 --> 00:06:26,150
broadly the cosby them Birgeneau

100
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:31,580
a good

101
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:35,420
the numbers British in 00 hope

102
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:38,750
this features as exploits

103
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:42,450
this would have been a tease using us

104
00:06:42,450 --> 00:06:47,620
us they said scorsese is getting
banalities per se that was for a year

105
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:51,340
I am the is a person at the station

106
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:55,180
2002 black password to access to let me
know

107
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:58,360
Rs in at their am router

108
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:01,640
you see a and if I communities saying

109
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:06,330
just the Wiese S&P you seen also

110
00:07:06,330 --> 00:07:10,100
the FTP and if I'll pass were and the

111
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:13,590
Sandra just come with this tunnel in the
state can activate it

112
00:07:13,590 --> 00:07:16,670
don't understand why abouts a

113
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:19,710
okay so one decides

114
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:24,430
I'll miss I want to his router can be
and misstates from

115
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:28,190
from internment the the soweto

116
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:32,090
where will be always in sight but this
open

117
00:07:32,090 --> 00:07:37,030
also another way to hack deserters

118
00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:40,500
a this crack in their wifi

119
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:44,620
on also connect to the Internet
administration Pennell

120
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:49,680
I'm just into the faux pas was a set
always to change

121
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:52,970
the NS in a computer is directly

122
00:07:52,970 --> 00:07:56,250
using command-line we both someone dont

123
00:07:56,250 --> 00:08:02,350
block his computer or not common 9 a.m.
with

124
00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:07,170
your mouse a sister Betty a similar
property is

125
00:08:07,170 --> 00:08:12,470
at a fish enough to CPAP DNAs

126
00:08:12,470 --> 00:08:15,199
from the followed yes B no I won't put

127
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:18,540
my own DNS and

128
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:22,380
to attack it I'll

129
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:25,580
also another way to attack this year
this

130
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:29,120
I especially at the S so

131
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:33,240
repairs s with our group the islamic I

132
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:36,919
the setback is not very but the cable
that

133
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:40,460
a in our up there really an

134
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:44,420
we molting eBay I

135
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:49,270
Islam our little one I'll

136
00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:54,330
with good yet today following a of our
normal you share

137
00:08:54,330 --> 00:08:58,520
connect heat to that disallow on with
the Islam

138
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:02,160
we a we are a brooch

139
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:05,529
a provider normally bryars

140
00:09:05,529 --> 00:09:10,820
half I'll I missed jump on El address
dictate

141
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:14,490
for some I'll eyepiece

142
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:17,570
address okay with a

143
00:09:17,570 --> 00:09:22,839
a while the with our network we got this
book that is

144
00:09:22,839 --> 00:09:26,779
IP address I we can connect to the
router

145
00:09:26,779 --> 00:09:29,920
on this ticket its

146
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:33,700
not be but the cable abouts I

147
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:37,770
under in the lower creates works very
well on also the

148
00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:42,040
some nasa my word that change the DNS
error of the computer

149
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:46,800
a hoe

150
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:51,250
it work this is the numba attacked thats

151
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:55,830
a we just two to see a

152
00:09:55,830 --> 00:09:59,290
or internet the camps

153
00:09:59,290 --> 00:10:02,660
do I DSCP requests to their router

154
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:05,830
I the route that

155
00:10:05,830 --> 00:10:07,680
I

156
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:11,870
respond to their DSCP with their

157
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:15,139
I internal IP I'm not with the fake

158
00:10:15,139 --> 00:10:18,600
DNS server IP address

159
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:22,040
so now that the PN half

160
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:25,570
comfy rate are or at the techa

161
00:10:25,570 --> 00:10:29,500
I the NSA red I'm not

162
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:33,970
he wants to connect through any domain
know you that would you demand dot com

163
00:10:33,970 --> 00:10:37,860
okay those with larger demand a call

164
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:42,519
on the computer they're better system
associates did this

165
00:10:42,519 --> 00:10:45,970
the N this domain cut no okay

166

okay i forward to the in a separate you
are really in a separate

171
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:09,079
I'll I send a response to the client

172
00:11:09,079 --> 00:11:12,540
the key and dang connect to that

173
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:15,540
IP address no problem but

174
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:16,730
a

175
00:11:16,730 --> 00:11:20,399
at if that dumb enough to miss and Evan
least

176
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:23,519
us there ups above that occur

177
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:26,209
he send ice Beaufort a

178
00:11:26,209 --> 00:11:31,369
down a fake IP address to 8 p.m. and
they can connect to that

179
00:11:31,369 --> 00:11:35,559
to that IP address bursting protect

180
00:11:35,559 --> 00:11:39,429
it does the

181
00:11:39,429 --> 00:11:42,529
they use years

182
00:11:42,529 --> 00:11:46,139
Metasploit misplayed I'll

183
00:11:46,139 --> 00:11:50,329
a DNS error a to us both did you miss
request

184
00:11:50,329 --> 00:11:53,579
the DNS mask and not to

185
00:11:53,579 --> 00:11:57,550
to these themes or directly i buy in
syrup

186
00:11:57,550 --> 00:12:03,529
that a computer i buy server sometimes
we phone that's their base ever that

187
00:12:03,529 --> 00:12:04,510
that the guy use

188
00:12:04,510 --> 00:12:11,510
is hacked so then

189
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:15,510
where one data could have the Essar on
country that

190
00:12:15,510 --> 00:12:19,279
the traffic up there now the client

191
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:22,720
a can use a back does

192
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:25,959
birch Street to perhaps he HTTP

193
00:12:25,959 --> 00:12:29,130
all mind a mere proxy

194
00:12:29,130 --> 00:12:32,300
SSO streep I'll

195
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:35,630
he can do it's D&I index young

196
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:38,870

information about ambrosia split

198
00:12:42,089 --> 00:12:45,430
gates to let try to

199
00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:50,000
that inside the computer and this is

200
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,410
therefore HDPE for all their

201
00:12:53,410 --> 00:12:57,690
protocol that's are not HDB DDP

202
00:12:57,690 --> 00:13:01,800
the guy I both a

00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:04,290
the communication you seen SSO the split

204
00:13:04,290 --> 00:13:08,280
for I am up s or

205
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:13,630
estimate that ass up up three s an ESL
protocol

206
00:13:13,630 --> 00:13:17,710
or I'll some actors

207
00:13:17,710 --> 00:13:22,010
not the home not a good glance

208
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:25,290
a want to go know their

209
00:13:25,290 --> 00:13:28,770
realllll occurs the defacing like

210
00:13:28,770 --> 00:13:32,640
the this you can elect an economy that's
not cool

211
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:35,900
the face you know where his snot would

212
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:39,000
up you're preaching is not good bytes

213
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,430
and they're better readout eckardt's

214
00:13:42,430 --> 00:13:46,830
I there may not be a tease

215
00:13:46,830 --> 00:13:50,590
sniffing the data all information since

216
00:13:50,590 --> 00:13:55,180
he

217
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:58,450
when this plane the school

218
00:13:58,450 --> 00:14:05,180
at true our customer I so I i said

219
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:08,650
okay they they're doing these a

220
00:14:08,650 --> 00:14:12,670
abouts yeah dream bat and this attack

221
00:14:12,670 --> 00:14:17,620
they have I let us take those it's very
easy to detect them

222
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:21,620
IOM

223
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:26,090
that's their the reason for my my pussy
research

224
00:14:26,090 --> 00:14:31,810
to I will use of Texas first like a

225
00:14:31,810 --> 00:14:36,660
SSL Certificates I'll

226
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:40,790
if they're is their objectives

227
00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:45,340
the victim at fish to connect directly
to our rights to DBS said we're

228
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:47,590
or any SSO

229
00:14:47,590 --> 00:14:51,060
senator the program we the

230
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:56,140
launch on alerts at sis Mary specific

231
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:59,670
yeah lets the miss at least in the
Spanish and sorry

232
00:14:59,670 --> 00:15:03,910
Matt okay is now

233
00:15:03,910 --> 00:15:08,620
few years later a it was very easy to
say

234
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:12,850
yes oh yes set much nowadays 90s in a
sari see

235
00:15:12,850 --> 00:15:16,230
I for the at Tech it is very

236
00:15:16,230 --> 00:15:19,380
critic I'll dismiss has to because he
can be

237
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:24,170
easily detect it all this decrease

238
00:15:24,170 --> 00:15:28,360
and says certificates being I'll

239
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:33,400
on inmates thats implements I more or
less the same seeing that

240
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:36,460
thing in certificates is unless you have

241
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:39,660
a belly certificates because

242
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:43,230
yeah you have a

243
00:15:43,230 --> 00:15:47,080
a belly roots a

244
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:51,670
certification authority a

245
00:15:51,670 --> 00:15:55,390
some some no a yes some

246
00:15:55,390 --> 00:15:59,420
grocers the a Google Chrome and Firefox

247
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:02,570
I don't know if another 1/2 feet

248
00:16:02,570 --> 00:16:03,960
the

249
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:07,860
I have knows exactly what certificates
the server

250
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:11,770
must the seine their damn what's address

251
00:16:11,770 --> 00:16:15,050
specifically so any

252
00:16:15,050 --> 00:16:18,710
even a you have a valid certificates is
very difficult

253
00:16:18,710 --> 00:16:25,030
to tomb to hijack does make the day tab
for example for Gmail

254
00:16:25,030 --> 00:16:30,140
this

255
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:35,050
as I said before missus at most critical
for their tech every cause

256
00:16:35,050 --> 00:16:42,050
is very easy to that affect them another
stalker

257
00:16:42,330 --> 00:16:45,690
is a H s

258
00:16:45,690 --> 00:16:49,030
yes its DBS ticked past but security

259
00:16:49,030 --> 00:16:52,640
I is sad I am

260
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:56,250

to a boy as a stylist the paddocks

266
00:17:15,339 --> 00:17:19,190
I'll yeah this

267
00:17:19,190 --> 00:17:22,440
no a

268
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:25,809
this here at the to the

269

00:17:32,489 --> 00:17:35,700
aside always

272
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:40,239
d'amato I was there a HD raoul

273
00:17:40,239 --> 00:17:41,080
a

274
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:44,690
set to you is that is the name

275
00:17:44,690 --> 00:17:48,440
a their webpage

276
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:52,480
as say's connect to HTTP

277
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:56,490
gmail the male at that will the pump

278
00:17:56,490 --> 00:17:59,560
that dunce bother

279
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:02,790
you must to connect using HD DBS

280
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:07,340
I'll some grocers

281
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:11,980
of implemented inside Sun the

282
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:15,440
site by the fault true loan

283
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:20,420
the nearby a H HTTPS Apple I that's 8

284
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:23,940
SDS sites for example mail over

285
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:29,640
the Kong are or Facebook is the clear

286
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:32,870
is not critical because I

287
00:18:32,870 --> 00:18:36,850
and I got can I'll be doing now trying
to do

288
00:18:36,850 --> 00:18:40,720
on this so the street attack buses there

289
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:46,020
um the victim will not see anything
wrong way because peace

290
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:49,169
brosser we connect wii using HTTPS

291
00:18:49,169 --> 00:18:52,710
the same a what that I could do

292
00:18:52,710 --> 00:18:55,880
so is missus no I'm not good because
decker

293
00:18:55,880 --> 00:19:01,179
something another step let

294
00:19:01,179 --> 00:19:04,710
just for example as the state's a
signature

295
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:08,830
if you are a checking the host a

296
00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:12,179
to your machine a and you provide here

297
00:19:12,179 --> 00:19:17,190
that said yes and air they're eating is
trying to connect to a less

298
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:22,040
as a set I'll II seeing the warning is
very

299
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:25,049
it's very clear

300
00:19:25,049 --> 00:19:28,880
critical for the attacker

301
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:32,820
because they beat king with saying ol

302
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:39,820
coaching where you so things have
ticking me other stalker

303
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:45,370
are for some poor said with runners I'll

304
00:19:45,370 --> 00:19:49,510
what but three on FTP an SMTP

305
00:19:49,510 --> 00:19:54,060
the band have the cell Res if you are
really acting the traffic to your own

306
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:55,610
a

307
00:19:55,610 --> 00:19:58,760
Sedaris the the money will be not

308
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:04,100
the same Matt this is not a critical
problem but

309
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:07,790
who see that the banners because you
have your all

310
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:12,309

311
00:20:12,309 --> 00:20:15,140
my email K and dont so me that the
banner

312
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:18,279
death to be abandoned

313
00:20:18,279 --> 00:20:22,000
can be critical well some people

314
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:26,019
I'm missing me a

315
00:20:26,019 --> 00:20:29,720
jus the there the command line that

316
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:34,029
FTP client so I can see their primaries

317
00:20:34,029 --> 00:20:38,649
or what saying connecting to i make
yourself cerise

318
00:20:38,649 --> 00:20:41,779
course this is something as this

319
00:20:41,779 --> 00:20:46,779
come because you go no on

320
00:20:46,779 --> 00:20:50,630
there should've up that East if you are
done well

321
00:20:50,630 --> 00:20:55,230
is that I could don't want to be
detected he had heap must to be

322
00:20:55,230 --> 00:20:58,870
limited to some hosts I he will be

323
00:20:58,870 --> 00:21:02,380
limited should to some articles to not

324
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:09,380
I left to the victim the set

325
00:21:10,830 --> 00:21:15,019
additions limited post or so

326
00:21:15,019 --> 00:21:18,330
time to study day P communication minus
have to the victim

327
00:21:18,330 --> 00:21:21,630
at the Tekkit can state okay

328
00:21:21,630 --> 00:21:25,559

both their to to the service also you
are limited

335
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:52,809
database link that to the to be a test
protocols

336
00:21:52,809 --> 00:21:56,070
if us I said is on want

337
00:21:56,070 --> 00:22:00,120
to intercept and limited by HD two Bs

338
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:03,250
I both be seen I and II point because

late I we we I we'll the talk about that

340
00:22:07,090 --> 00:22:11,640
is super political on

341
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:15,250
that I can master Sep to loose a lot of

person you to tool get

346
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:36,080
discussion I don't want the victim to
order the

347
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:39,440
to detect the attack I'm to improv

348
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:43,420
add that to him from time sir or I want
moderator

00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:47,360
on for that I will use

350
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:50,670
I audience get your for

351
00:22:50,670 --> 00:22:54,270
liability I love balancing nazis

352
00:22:54,270 --> 00:22:58,270
I multiple responses folks some poets

353

355
00:23:02,210 --> 00:23:05,730
I look up of roulette your thief

356
00:23:05,730 --> 00:23:08,920
when 23 for 5

357
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:14,430
archer's so if

358
00:23:14,430 --> 00:23:19,120
arm on there but insistent if try to
connect to

359
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:20,610
said reason

360
00:23:20,610 --> 00:23:24,290
and WWOR dot com will try

361
00:23:24,290 --> 00:23:27,570
first the first IP address

362
00:23:27,570 --> 00:23:31,210
a if he can't connect

363
00:23:31,210 --> 00:23:35,070
he would take the second IP address he
got if you can connect

364
00:23:35,070 --> 00:23:38,080
author setter a

365
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:41,760
you can see that then it I

366
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:45,120
need I mean it before the INS lookup

367
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:51,530
and the IP address our difference so you
seen the

368
00:23:51,530 --> 00:23:54,960
dispatcher ho I E at

369
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:58,370
made the attack okay

370
00:23:58,370 --> 00:24:02,300
I the pink ask

371
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:06,070
to the router at deets

372
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:09,510
at yet CP request they're out there was
hot

373
00:24:09,510 --> 00:24:13,320
on the DNS error was change on

374
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:16,530
a so their protests and I

375
00:24:16,530 --> 00:24:20,470
DHCP response with their fake DNS server

376
00:24:20,470 --> 00:24:25,040
their weak teams

377
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:28,850
at a big deal worth to connect to any
site and sent I

378
00:24:28,850 --> 00:24:34,590
DNS requests to that our server that
this error

379
00:24:34,590 --> 00:24:35,920
sense a

380
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:40,010
I for water and add request to REI DNAs

381
00:24:40,010 --> 00:24:43,400
the Rens and unresponsive to their
attackers had ever

382
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:47,910
and then that this server sense I the N
is this post to the

383
00:24:47,910 --> 00:24:51,480
I'm to the 15 bites

384
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:53,180
a its the

385
00:24:53,180 --> 00:24:57,680
iight at this I at the top their lease

a to IP address to IP address

387
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:06,560
that are controllable you hit me that

memory and is a shooting with us a way

396
00:25:34,590 --> 00:25:37,840

try to connect I'll to any severance

398
00:25:41,799 --> 00:25:45,350
and disagree portraying end up in a

399
00:25:45,350 --> 00:25:50,049
into CP to that at the cursor over

400
00:25:50,049 --> 00:25:54,659
and that their separate Sen I'll

401
00:25:54,659 --> 00:25:58,840
russet packets %uh thats a

402
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:03,340
seen request what's the

403
00:26:03,340 --> 00:26:06,630
between what we do the

404
00:26:06,630 --> 00:26:13,630
between we connect do that next terror
but

405
00:26:14,770 --> 00:26:18,559
now that eckardt at Nos wire

406
00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:21,610
the the meeting was to connect

407
00:26:21,610 --> 00:26:24,960
and the what

408
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:29,039
wall art and wants to connect to I'm

409
00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:32,130
compute the the second IP address

410
00:26:32,130 --> 00:26:36,150
to for what a some the connection

411
00:26:36,150 --> 00:26:40,380
to let real server to their real server
that they're eating once

412
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:44,059
initially so they're beating the Saints

413
00:26:44,059 --> 00:26:48,010
I'll I thing packet

414
00:26:48,010 --> 00:26:52,010
gain political IP address that this also
controlled by the

415
00:26:52,010 --> 00:26:55,530
by the attacker that I care for our
there

416
00:26:55,530 --> 00:26:59,380
the same packet that yes I rather
restaurant sir and

417
00:26:59,380 --> 00:27:02,539
attack that for where the Asha back to
the victim

418
00:27:02,539 --> 00:27:06,429
on the car the commission is a spotless

419
00:27:06,429 --> 00:27:11,400
through their own the center of the
trucker

420
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:14,409
now the packet a

421
00:27:14,409 --> 00:27:19,450
can do or what that he want

422
00:27:19,450 --> 00:27:22,280
with the connection on Leah sniffing

423
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:26,140
I am become

424
00:27:26,140 --> 00:27:30,210
mollify that data and

425
00:27:30,210 --> 00:27:35,740
what happened by example

426
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:38,900
is there anything initially once to
connect to a lil

427
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:42,650
a on dorm HTTP Lisa

428
00:27:42,650 --> 00:27:46,290
to parts eighty that I get gone

429
00:27:46,290 --> 00:27:50,340
a half I miss about boxing but what
street for example

430
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:54,180
at the Tiger can reject

431
00:27:54,180 --> 00:27:55,030
a

432
00:27:55,030 --> 00:27:58,290
as so parts in at that both

433
00:27:58,290 --> 00:28:02,410
pp address because they attacked the

434
00:28:02,410 --> 00:28:06,460
depicting will connect later to their

435
00:28:06,460 --> 00:28:10,710
to they renounce terror the Rio server
so their victim will not

436
00:28:10,710 --> 00:28:11,210
a

437
00:28:11,210 --> 00:28:15,130
see a any as a sale learning

438
00:28:15,130 --> 00:28:18,710
I

439
00:28:18,710 --> 00:28:21,970
from and other connects else can be

440

you can see thats you receive the IP
other stuff will

00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:10,999
yes blast

467

first we'll connect to that used to be
addressed and

472
00:30:30,049 --> 00:30:34,429
the quality the it bans it will connect
to the second one

473

they are text but they're going to save
10% also the HTTPS

645
00:45:53,249 --> 00:45:57,189

00:47:07,790 --> 00:47:11,170
666 part or any other part

663
00:47:11,170 --> 00:47:14,650
dent do I

664
00:47:14,650 --> 00:47:17,760
are possible phenol are electing the

665
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:21,170
traffic up their victim I'll

666
00:47:21,170 --> 00:47:24,640
to our server without first proving this
example

667
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:28,830
then lunch a stylist

668
00:47:28,830 --> 00:47:31,650
airstrip in the parts the

669
00:47:31,650 --> 00:47:36,229
we want we will compute before in this
example 66

670
00:47:36,229 --> 00:47:39,900
and then the directing

671
00:47:39,900 --> 00:47:44,180
1k to connect to http we connect through
and the

672
00:47:44,180 --> 00:47:48,829
SS ls3 proxy on there's a fifty proxy we

673
00:47:48,829 --> 00:47:54,369
wheel for wire that connects him to the
h2b it to that relates to DBS said a

674
00:47:54,369 --> 00:47:54,999
rare

675
00:47:54,999 --> 00:47:58,719
about that we maintain at it HTTP

676
00:47:58,719 --> 00:48:02,940
to their to everything and a with enough
by a new

677
00:48:02,940 --> 00:48:05,270
you can see there

678
00:48:05,270 --> 00:48:11,030
you share on the bus were sitter said

679
00:48:11,030 --> 00:48:15,750
its to keep it 8 it's picked up a CIA
security

680
00:48:15,750 --> 00:48:18,960
the will mates perforce air

681
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:22,220
for some interesting sites mandatory

682
00:48:22,220 --> 00:48:25,460
to connect the Bhd as 8

683
00:48:25,460 --> 00:48:28,560
to DBS so as there is deep

684
00:48:28,560 --> 00:48:32,380
must be no successful so

685
00:48:32,380 --> 00:48:35,790
for for that I A develop as a steep

686
00:48:35,790 --> 00:48:40,130
Lucy I my scene

687
00:48:40,130 --> 00:48:43,990
that as ticked up a security policy is
betting domain names

688
00:48:43,990 --> 00:48:47,250
pro-press unit

689
00:48:47,250 --> 00:48:48,780
in the

690
00:48:48,780 --> 00:48:52,920
in the brochure or not at the or using
the HTTP

691
00:48:52,920 --> 00:48:56,700
here so a

692
00:48:56,700 --> 00:49:00,200
dSSSB plouffe's change assets in history

693
00:49:00,200 --> 00:49:03,480
HTTPS to http but

694
00:49:03,480 --> 00:49:09,050
also chains the my name's us

695
00:49:09,050 --> 00:49:12,720
we control the DNS server we can resolve
this

696
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:16,080
at the NS the this domain name string

697
00:49:16,080 --> 00:49:19,280
think before to that with every 01

698
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:22,840
so 8 H SDS

699
00:49:22,840 --> 00:49:26,200
its base on them domain names we can eat
so

700
00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:31,960
its HDS spong will

701
00:49:31,960 --> 00:49:38,960
with the second them all

702
00:49:49,839 --> 00:49:52,020
okay you have launched is

703
00:49:52,020 --> 00:49:59,020
we look real and check eight

704
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:04,619
in

705
00:50:04,619 --> 00:50:11,619
beans he yes

706
00:50:15,310 --> 00:50:21,980
I'll we'll lunch as a street on BART

707
00:50:21,980 --> 00:50:26,440
chin to sniffing everything

708
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:33,440
in

709
00:50:41,550 --> 00:50:45,020
shopping

710
00:50:45,020 --> 00:50:50,910
as he said

711
00:50:50,910 --> 00:50:54,750
woke from I'm some sites by the frying

712
00:50:54,750 --> 00:50:57,860
us I mandatory to connet

713
00:50:57,860 --> 00:51:01,650
you seen edge to DPS for example

714
00:51:01,650 --> 00:51:03,950
male a

715
00:51:03,950 --> 00:51:07,520
that will end up come out or a comb that
go with the

716
00:51:07,520 --> 00:51:11,060
come is

717
00:51:11,060 --> 00:51:13,530
but the

718
00:51:13,530 --> 00:51:17,730
it done of a

719
00:51:17,730 --> 00:51:20,050
www.woot.com

720
00:51:20,050 --> 00:51:23,360
I stop a finite the site to connect

721
00:51:23,360 --> 00:51:28,350
using HTTPS so if you put know you
though you load of cum

722
00:51:28,350 --> 00:51:31,800
it will connect using

723
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:36,140
HTTP yeah

724
00:51:36,140 --> 00:51:39,830
a say me too

725
00:51:39,830 --> 00:51:43,150
and move the Singapore going

726
00:51:43,150 --> 00:51:46,320
everything is okay and I want to

727
00:51:46,320 --> 00:51:52,010
a start a session I dunno if you can't
see

728
00:51:52,010 --> 00:51:56,760
no bit I will press I want to a
statistician

729
00:51:56,760 --> 00:52:00,460
will yahoo.com but

730
00:52:00,460 --> 00:52:03,930
missed something strange is

731
00:52:03,930 --> 00:52:08,930
here the URL it must be

732
00:52:08,930 --> 00:52:12,410
a Kolsch dot will dot com

733
00:52:12,410 --> 00:52:15,470
but a net

734
00:52:15,470 --> 00:52:19,119
various when past is opponents in
Spanish

735
00:52:19,119 --> 00:52:22,960
the when tough but we will not calm

736
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:25,970
a change there

737
00:52:25,970 --> 00:52:30,410
domain added to mine others I'm is there
is no

738
00:52:30,410 --> 00:52:34,400
HTTPS because I

739
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:37,510
chain the HTTPS a

740
00:52:37,510 --> 00:52:42,260
um I'd estimate PML and also trying
their demands a run

741
00:52:42,260 --> 00:52:46,010
I N kroll says

742
00:52:46,010 --> 00:52:49,200
okay about 2002 this site I can connect

743
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:53,850
using HTTP nuclear test I can taste

744
00:52:53,850 --> 00:53:00,690
I can you wish any I'll

745
00:53:00,690 --> 00:53:04,140
for example in the I'm and the con is
not

746
00:53:04,140 --> 00:53:08,770
Korea if I try to

747
00:53:08,770 --> 00:53:15,770
lull lowing sigh much work or to secure

748
00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:21,660
it was said

749
00:53:21,660 --> 00:53:24,960
on that the other races now there and

750
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:28,870
let me know but where is my vote but
should bushing that

751
00:53:28,870 --> 00:53:35,870
we use I would but your in the

752
00:53:36,920 --> 00:53:41,730
at the am

753
00:53:41,730 --> 00:53:48,730
I enough I am

754
00:53:58,710 --> 00:54:00,690
up

755
00:54:00,690 --> 00:54:03,740
here home you know that's

756
00:54:03,740 --> 00:54:10,740
team you know working

757
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:19,380
mean the

758
00:54:19,380 --> 00:54:23,320
here okay

759
00:54:23,320 --> 00:54:28,810
yes know if the am day post

760
00:54:28,810 --> 00:54:32,380
we do to account will read that column

761
00:54:32,380 --> 00:54:35,820
great because the

762
00:54:35,820 --> 00:54:39,200
SSD change there the main

763
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:45,610
and send to that the real server on the
bus were or

764
00:54:45,610 --> 00:54:50,660
name

765
00:54:50,660 --> 00:54:54,460
Damian Lazarus

766
00:54:54,460 --> 00:54:57,890
year so

767
00:54:57,890 --> 00:55:01,360
I we've gone still listening if

768
00:55:01,360 --> 00:55:05,210
using as a streep a connections

769
00:55:05,210 --> 00:55:08,680
I'll are bleeding H

770
00:55:08,680 --> 00:55:15,680
eights SPS stick proper security

771
00:55:18,560 --> 00:55:25,010
I have also read your butt it's not time
so

772
00:55:25,010 --> 00:55:27,900
as I said stick tupper tape the

773
00:55:27,900 --> 00:55:31,270
security is own because if you

774
00:55:31,270 --> 00:55:34,580
if you know if you can for the deck
traffic

775
00:55:34,580 --> 00:55:36,900
to senate at to the

776
00:55:36,900 --> 00:55:41,560
as a stylistic Sarah you also con-
project traffic to your

777
00:55:41,560 --> 00:55:44,650
to your own DNS error the

778
00:55:44,650 --> 00:55:47,970
from also here

779
00:55:47,970 --> 00:55:51,190
I have some rules are wire rules

780
00:55:51,190 --> 00:55:54,330
a to change that my name's

781
00:55:54,330 --> 00:55:57,360
plan for example I both

782
00:55:57,360 --> 00:56:00,930
accounts will load of cum chain talk
when does the word

783
00:56:00,930 --> 00:56:04,160
gum but air all there said rare

784
00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:06,270
I boots a

785
00:56:06,270 --> 00:56:08,950
for W the

786
00:56:08,950 --> 00:56:11,580
I would you

787
00:56:11,580 --> 00:56:13,690
and to

788
00:56:13,690 --> 00:56:18,630
chained to the my name Nall many

789
00:56:18,630 --> 00:56:21,770
people will be see

790
00:56:21,770 --> 00:56:25,070
therefore I would use I do you are on so

791
00:56:25,070 --> 00:56:28,210
it will be buried us parents the

792
00:56:28,210 --> 00:56:31,580
for example I am father is

793
00:56:31,580 --> 00:56:33,440
the

794
00:56:33,440 --> 00:56:37,090
said wheres I put wept a

795
00:56:37,090 --> 00:56:40,570
but affects the the

796
00:56:40,570 --> 00:56:47,570
mining so it's a very touched by it

797
00:56:57,780 --> 00:57:00,920
all for all their a for the

798
00:57:00,920 --> 00:57:04,680
use this attack you need now they're big
teen

799
00:57:04,680 --> 00:57:08,470
first connect drool any site in these

800
00:57:08,470 --> 00:57:12,160
and in this demo to Google using HTTP

801
00:57:12,160 --> 00:57:15,410
is the if they're eating connect
directly

802
00:57:15,410 --> 00:57:18,870
to https or

803
00:57:18,870 --> 00:57:21,880
me that connects to our all those
surveyed that use

804
00:57:21,880 --> 00:57:22,280
the

805
00:57:22,280 --> 00:57:27,600
as a cell of in my pocket but you must
take i want to i want that of other

806
00:57:27,600 --> 00:57:29,650
factors are when I really it is

807
00:57:29,650 --> 00:57:33,170
for example there I'm young people the

808
00:57:33,170 --> 00:57:36,530
use peace owned the certificates

809
00:57:36,530 --> 00:57:41,130
the to form intercept with traffic

810
00:57:41,130 --> 00:57:45,280
that's very some that will implement the
certificate pinning

811
00:57:45,280 --> 00:57:48,340
his grocer a.m.

812
00:57:48,340 --> 00:57:52,580
someone we don't know who

813
00:57:52,580 --> 00:57:56,460
a steel Park Trust as a

814
00:57:56,460 --> 00:58:00,240
certificates group at the gate a

815
00:58:00,240 --> 00:58:03,390
with a for

816
00:58:03,390 --> 00:58:06,960
for a while the this guy is cool there
make

817
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:12,830
the rat certificates and you can take a
run patch of

818
00:58:12,830 --> 00:58:16,339
all that back like beast up crying the

819
00:58:16,339 --> 00:58:20,479
pass play now by unanimous refill I

820
00:58:20,479 --> 00:58:23,589
on although of course resolutely

821
00:58:23,589 --> 00:58:27,150
you can't they I want out of go to play
the

822
00:58:27,150 --> 00:58:30,239
bach an iPhone on their about of

823
00:58:30,239 --> 00:58:33,430
at selling us

824
00:58:33,430 --> 00:58:36,619
X my reach personally approached

825
00:58:36,619 --> 00:58:42,279
or personality issues in this is

826
00:58:42,279 --> 00:58:45,859
the do sound only that backs to other
protocols

827
00:58:45,859 --> 00:58:48,950
at how at Peets in fact he owes

828
00:58:48,950 --> 00:58:52,539
there was a talk about that saying
blackouts and

829
00:58:52,539 --> 00:58:56,640
two years ago of for the cause they know
their protocol

830
00:58:56,640 --> 00:58:59,650
they said asked though NSA

831
00:58:59,650 --> 00:59:06,650
a Nikon sir but lemme I'll that tax
that's I'm thinking it's attack

832
00:59:06,839 --> 00:59:10,390
for example the the for of what stops

833
00:59:10,390 --> 00:59:13,529
of what's up with it's not too difficult

834
00:59:13,529 --> 00:59:18,650
to do I lost

835
00:59:18,650 --> 00:59:19,800
I

836
00:59:19,800 --> 00:59:23,870
not was talking about DCP my

837
00:59:23,870 --> 00:59:26,460
was well the matter with the

838
00:59:26,460 --> 00:59:30,100
the P the GP a

839
00:59:30,100 --> 00:59:34,940
there the content of the communication
is not by the operating system is fair

840
00:59:34,940 --> 00:59:38,619
there communication if begin by the

841
00:59:38,619 --> 00:59:42,039
there by the application so if the
application

842
00:59:42,039 --> 00:59:45,170
Resende the net on

843
00:59:45,170 --> 00:59:48,269
sleepy bucket we can

844
00:59:48,269 --> 00:59:52,670
use the same the same

845
00:59:52,670 --> 00:59:56,750
methyl to to the Tecate if not send

846
00:59:56,750 --> 01:00:00,460
at the and the the UP packet

847
01:00:00,460 --> 01:00:04,410
percent it we can't and the set it

848
01:00:04,410 --> 01:00:10,040
are in I would wait the

849
01:00:10,040 --> 01:00:13,660
um I only poll II you

850
01:00:13,660 --> 01:00:16,990
was as me feel like company network on
my yeah

851
01:00:16,990 --> 01:00:21,370
my own thing the Communications Inc my
house

852
01:00:21,370 --> 01:00:25,140
arm the only the packets

853
01:00:25,140 --> 01:00:29,640
ISO was of course the NS S&M

854
01:00:29,640 --> 01:00:34,620
s and and beating my company on

855
01:00:34,620 --> 01:00:38,320
be okay not to use to to play its

856
01:00:38,320 --> 01:00:42,160
so this not a said missus

857
01:00:42,160 --> 01:00:46,150
probably on are some I by Peter

858
01:00:46,150 --> 01:00:48,300
services that can use

859
01:00:48,300 --> 01:00:52,470
GP batts that a lot I

860
01:00:52,470 --> 01:00:56,150
my obligation still only controlled PCP
bats

861
01:00:56,150 --> 01:01:01,530
solely up before onset but if anyone
wants to use it

862
01:01:01,530 --> 01:01:05,700
can see that's the its the call this a
very CN kindest

863
01:01:05,700 --> 01:01:11,260
extent or less than ideal

864
01:01:11,260 --> 01:01:14,310
that come being a

865
01:01:14,310 --> 01:01:17,900
be up lights at this attack of hope cool

866
01:01:17,900 --> 01:01:21,320
control the end DNS I

867
01:01:21,320 --> 01:01:25,110
when someone hack the DNS

868
01:01:25,110 --> 01:01:30,170
of our of our a fire company or for our
country

869
01:01:30,170 --> 01:01:33,210
directly it so

870
01:01:33,210 --> 01:01:36,650
using this technique con a

871
01:01:36,650 --> 01:01:39,880
across the date they tied the traffic to
that company

872
01:01:39,880 --> 01:01:43,700
or the down %uh that you set up that

873
01:01:43,700 --> 01:01:47,960
the NS I'm

874
01:01:47,960 --> 01:01:51,680
conclusion I am

875
01:01:51,680 --> 01:01:55,490
will

876
01:01:55,490 --> 01:01:58,750
I improve the DNS condition no attacks

877
01:01:58,750 --> 01:02:02,380
with two dudes a

878
01:02:02,380 --> 01:02:05,800
now it's Mar a easily

879
01:02:05,800 --> 01:02:09,650
to on to kayak these these
communications

880
01:02:09,650 --> 01:02:13,700
a all protocols means

881
01:02:13,700 --> 01:02:17,220
although security new protocols

882
01:02:17,220 --> 01:02:20,280
blass all a proper clothes is

883
01:02:20,280 --> 01:02:24,360
all security so sing better

884
01:02:24,360 --> 01:02:27,880
butts steel 00 security

885
01:02:27,880 --> 01:02:32,320
that's means insecurity tradition for
that

886
01:02:32,320 --> 01:02:35,400
the NSA and that's the

887
01:02:35,400 --> 01:02:39,060
in this response a must be

888
