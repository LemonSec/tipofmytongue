1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,800
so the study at home starting with a
quick introduction ass to use

2
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:07,549
I'm what our online payment systems him
I

3
00:00:07,549 --> 00:00:11,259
wanna talk about this but what can you
do the

4
00:00:11,259 --> 00:00:14,620
with the times and thanks them for
something I'm how do you go about doing

5
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:15,210
them

6
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:20,500
um not necessarily in that order and
legitimately that

7
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:24,580
this is not a PC I talked shit you
somehow thought that I was talking about

8
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:26,109
PCI compliance

9
00:00:26,109 --> 00:00:29,849
I'm strong one I'm

10
00:00:29,849 --> 00:00:33,630
I will try to avoid naming the
individual pending a wise use these

11
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:36,890
issues affect sprints column disarm

12
00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:39,899
degree and it so it is a showcase

13
00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:44,350
I'm gateway acts and using them amid
another one on the site

14
00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:48,120
you probably not to sound on marijuana
some want anything is

15
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:51,260
bizarre bed and

16
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:55,610
and one or the other things is that done
most that plugins for

17
00:00:55,610 --> 00:00:59,920
open source tools like you always
commerce sent out whatever

18
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:03,000
they're often written by a third-party
developer and

19
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,070
not necessarily that'd to you and the
time in

20
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:11,350
get web understand it isn't I'm stars
like implementation back to go home

21
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:14,369
lazem anything their lives in credit

22
00:01:14,369 --> 00:01:17,850
good what's in the bag 'em

23
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:21,979
run been mine credentials married to two
kids

24
00:01:21,979 --> 00:01:25,479
Rex countries in Chester I'm bid Tech Ed

25
00:01:25,479 --> 00:01:29,049
each up i'd right a blog kinda

26
00:01:29,049 --> 00:01:32,350
pretend write a blog on the up but
didn't play your house

27
00:01:32,350 --> 00:01:36,470
and run to projects mostly and

28
00:01:36,470 --> 00:01:39,560
identifying security flaws

29
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:43,320
on or you explore Jim vulnerabilities

30
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:46,860
so from a.m. that I guess countries
investors by hunters

31
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:50,369
I also contribute to some eyeball nom

32
00:01:50,369 --> 00:01:54,439
I'm open source projects hmm

33
00:01:54,439 --> 00:01:58,670
I'm now in what little spare time I have
I'm sup

34
00:01:58,670 --> 00:02:03,170
dumping injured I'm get less are
effectively the point of sale system

35
00:02:03,170 --> 00:02:07,799
up for webshop sign in almost up to walk
in you walk up to cash reg the

36
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:11,739
hand over cash payment gateway is the
equivalent

37
00:02:11,739 --> 00:02:14,870
and Websense that your own website %um

38
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:18,680
%um this themselves the timing got white
use

39
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:23,180
effectively that the cash register I'm
but its to be outsourced to somebody

40
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:23,680
else

41
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:27,310
apps

42
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:30,610
so bomb cricket is actually quite a bit
about on

43
00:02:30,610 --> 00:02:34,620
no what are the actors in the normal
online transaction

44
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:37,920
about some definitions we look at time
ago at the office

45
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:41,780
until noon on into the actual the Simon
abilities

46
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:44,980
ultimate about be usable talk for free
and

47
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:48,489
finally we going to discuss an
implementation bugs

48
00:02:48,489 --> 00:02:51,610
I'm I a couple demos for

49
00:02:51,610 --> 00:02:55,200
mostly since so I was dotted with the
customer

50
00:02:55,200 --> 00:03:00,349
just in a happy guy wants to shop online
get a startling to store

51
00:03:00,349 --> 00:03:03,930
not describe details Tom on

52
00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:07,909
the Mets and a few months to supply the
goods

53
00:03:07,909 --> 00:03:11,480
or services was Mexico cash I M

54
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:14,930
and mostly the Sunforce in this
presentation actually

55
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:18,019
affect mentioned not the customer or

56
00:03:18,019 --> 00:03:22,269
I'm the bank's or panda at the end so
the Panda I'm

57
00:03:22,269 --> 00:03:26,290
I'm typically the large financial
institutions

58
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:30,230
or and some case a small start-ups they

59
00:03:30,230 --> 00:03:34,530
tech a fractional each transaction
typically and I'm

60
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:37,900
and basically that's how they would
generate them on

61
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:41,180
and then there's the attacker

62
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:44,819
who's up suppose stance internet thinks
the destroyer

63
00:03:44,819 --> 00:03:49,430
and if you believed a popular press and
in this case

64
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:53,409
it would typically be other you know her
bored kids

65
00:03:53,409 --> 00:03:56,659
Oribe organized crime I'm

66
00:03:56,659 --> 00:04:00,860
while the attacks that we don't discuss
don't release jail to saddam

67
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:04,099
millions of dollars in damage unless you
do then

68
00:04:04,099 --> 00:04:07,870
across the internet and there's still
enough traction I think that

69
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:12,700
organize com would be willing to repeat
the stop attacks over and over

70
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:16,840
I'm however we don't really see them in
the wild but

71
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:20,120
justice its easy to steal im I did
million

72
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:23,160
credit card numbers from no RAND
Corporation

73
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:26,479
I'm but I'm

74
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:30,030
a sings get more more difficult we might
eventually end up seeing some these

75
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:30,870
attacks

76
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:34,680
I'm underwent winds the pope's ever
gonna go ice

77
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:39,770
from us two years there are medications
in place for a lot of these attacks but

78
00:04:39,770 --> 00:04:40,270
they're

79
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:43,690
isn't really any some incentives for the
customers to move on

80
00:04:43,690 --> 00:04:47,040
and so think while this summer lull
between

81
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:50,840
these things are being exploited in the
wall and a solution Texas

82
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:55,100
at some 100 try to push people to to
move onto

83
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:58,740
aside for attended absurd

84
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:02,080
that sup I'm if your cunt ester or

85
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:05,660
Garza implementing a timing i really
wanna

86
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:09,900
play around with him and should use Test
cat number so you don't have to

87
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:13,810
charge it out all the time I'm South
these are

88
00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:18,090
did gonna stop 10+2 put into and is on
time for mum

89
00:05:18,090 --> 00:05:23,350
and implementation testing I'm there are
often additional numbers that

90
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:27,030
might be specific to that timing I want
that returns

91
00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:31,750
certain behavior you want to test for
insufficient funds on the card or

92
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:36,030
Todd canceled in Satara I usually find
that summer

93
00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:40,139
information that developers got from the
pentagon where

94
00:05:40,139 --> 00:05:43,520
so on is always look with him in a
low-key

95
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:46,979
after developers gather that the
documentation I'm

96
00:05:46,979 --> 00:05:50,220
when testing the top be something
serious the muddy banks in the

97
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:51,720
implementation

98
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:56,190
in the integration at cetera supper

99
00:05:56,190 --> 00:06:00,940
and I'm the primary means some utilizing
a timing that way when you

100
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:04,830
run a website that in southeastern I P
I'm

101
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:09,060
and the general operations from an idea
i i things like charging you cannot

102
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:13,080
carrying the status of the job pre-order
on some classic your

103
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:17,030
like a hotel more and camping

104
00:06:17,030 --> 00:06:21,130
plus resort you wanna take a deposit but
not necessarily John

105
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:24,870
manager during payments if if you offer
subscription service this

106
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:30,530
on band refunds for I'm happy just us

107
00:06:30,530 --> 00:06:33,759
and the typically accessed through

108
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:37,740
cheered environments thus the sandbox
which is what you meant to be using

109
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:41,000
when you're developing apply gains or
integrating mean

110
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,620
with the time however I'm that's an
environment where

111
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:49,539
its fine to violent in one actually
charging pads it's on a

112
00:06:49,539 --> 00:06:52,590
as its playground. and this production

113
00:06:52,590 --> 00:06:56,060
now the details the mitchen

114
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:59,660
account your estimates typically shared
between these two environments

115
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:05,020
if you are an attacker I'm its better to
test your ex parte against the sandbox

116
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:08,800
kruzel if there's something wrong with
it you know what you have a type or sign

117
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,970
the sandwich with by so we give you nice
their message saying that %um

118
00:07:11,970 --> 00:07:17,199
you men style but one dropping Klaxons
on a fraud detection systems typically

119
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:17,729
miss

120
00:07:17,729 --> 00:07:21,440
that don't monitor did the moment

121
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:24,490
and sample that is somber

122
00:07:24,490 --> 00:07:28,130
trying to for by power playing with a

123
00:07:28,130 --> 00:07:31,349
an actual redirect top payment

124
00:07:31,349 --> 00:07:34,479
the sandbox gushing gonna invalidate
aggression

125
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:38,349
please contact mention and Sagan you can
tweak your exploit

126
00:07:38,349 --> 00:07:43,849
I in sandbox into lab where some time me
want to production from there

127
00:07:43,849 --> 00:07:47,330
sup on looking at on how r

128
00:07:47,330 --> 00:07:50,389
the various transactions where for the
different ways to implement the time ago

129
00:07:50,389 --> 00:07:51,379
I spoke

130
00:07:51,379 --> 00:07:54,930
and direct APR a sign

131
00:07:54,930 --> 00:07:59,190
that we see if a bit and typically this
means that the mission

132
00:07:59,190 --> 00:08:02,379
carries the burden up being PCI
compliant

133
00:08:02,379 --> 00:08:05,580
piece that I receive the credit card
auto corrected himself and pass it on to

134
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:06,629
Pam Geller

135
00:08:06,629 --> 00:08:10,870
which I suck at so stop with that being
a checkup page

136
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:14,960
you know I'm to the post directed to
mention website

137
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:18,180
Sam his work done on this the amount
that I wanna

138
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:21,440
hyper the goods to mine

139
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:26,009
then minutes and better as he said bag I
had the mixup progressed

140
00:08:26,009 --> 00:08:29,990
to the timing I'm and this guy sent to
cash in

141
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:34,200
as an adult I'm and so you wouldn't have
wanted

142
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:37,899
in person at southern edge in yes you
would have to knead the dough you that

143
00:08:37,899 --> 00:08:40,000
you would have to know the username and
password

144
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,049
I'm them and again which I just a tad
suspects

145
00:08:44,050 --> 00:08:48,320
status whether or not payment was
received as our seats

146
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:52,830
I'm more information and I'm and then
buy some at the National some action had

147
00:08:52,830 --> 00:08:55,519
small Siam Thai most successful

148
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:58,529
or minute by minute I'll please try
again

149
00:08:58,529 --> 00:09:04,000
a contact support whatever so that's
something very straight narrow

150
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,080
I'm simple implementation a but

151
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:10,870
it has the PCI requirements sup

152
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:14,170
a lot of people moving on to things like
hosted

153
00:09:14,170 --> 00:09:17,670
payment solution where the pattern I'm a
guy where

154
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:20,720
takes the credit card details director
the nation

155
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:25,950
doesn't actually have any involvement in
the payment transaction

156
00:09:25,950 --> 00:09:29,430
I'm and that white you what happened to
the PCI compliant

157
00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:32,600
but it means that there's a disconnect
between the mansion and the timing got

158
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:34,100
white

159
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:37,890
and South on this room there for abuse
in some will stop

160
00:09:37,890 --> 00:09:42,709
on an example this name is done you get
the check out page

161
00:09:42,709 --> 00:09:46,310
sent back hedged in our on

162
00:09:46,310 --> 00:09:50,459
and is a striker post from

163
00:09:50,459 --> 00:09:54,830
in the brosser to the timing that where
which effectively means that

164
00:09:54,830 --> 00:10:00,630
your magazine but the customers back in
the API call on behalf of the mentioned

165
00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:05,200
and pessimism the API for the pentagon
before this match in

166
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:09,250
is stop public and so if you were able
to

167
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:13,579
work out certain details but I used a
ballad

168
00:10:13,579 --> 00:10:17,240
but this is a the gym admission account

169
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:22,070
you could mess around this yes on

170
00:10:22,070 --> 00:10:25,880
suffer pasqua started coming I'm

171
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:29,010
with a crack at the Telus IMEI

172
00:10:29,010 --> 00:10:33,269
sense peccary directing at up charge do
Niamh please go back

173
00:10:33,269 --> 00:10:36,700
to mention Gatland provide the following
details so

174
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:40,410
as you can see there's a whole bunch up
to here in that

175
00:10:40,410 --> 00:10:44,120
us I'm so that I hear em

176
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:48,040
in the redirect sign in and he's the I'm
out

177
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:51,760
Center that process yep

178
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:56,000
redirects to mention website mention
website receives the details

179
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,570
and then based on what the brass
provides determines whether or not

180
00:10:59,570 --> 00:11:02,860
payment has been received your receipt

181
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:06,269
I'm in a might misek pick in class

182
00:11:06,269 --> 00:11:10,380
if you want us I'm the site you running
alaska missile

183
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:14,640
punished popular on solutions they often
have integration

184
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:18,250
they comply Saurer warehouse shipping

185
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:23,060
sour the moment even Bella that the
other times clearing ice into an account

186
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:26,209
just don't get chips try to our

187
00:11:26,209 --> 00:11:29,890
and different alternative is without
using a director post

188
00:11:29,890 --> 00:11:33,970
you take it back into a white level I'm

189
00:11:33,970 --> 00:11:38,769
page on the timing that way before doing
that post with a credit card details

190
00:11:38,769 --> 00:11:42,640
the same kinda stuff and yet to check a
patch to help aids

191
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:46,690
miscast redirect chance to be in your
head small home

192
00:11:46,690 --> 00:11:50,110
up sir and as you can see in the yep

193
00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:53,310
in here this although I mean that offer

194
00:11:53,310 --> 00:11:57,000
and the redirect I'm %um

195
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,800
use and that it happened at Lime any
other suspect had similar homes I'm

196
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:05,570
up this time you tried to details send
the credit that the toss

197
00:12:05,570 --> 00:12:09,240
and i'm having a ride just a tad sends
you back did mention

198
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:12,740
web sites I act lol now his

199
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:17,529
the details provided mention transaction
IdeaCentre

200
00:12:17,529 --> 00:12:21,470
which your breasts and the match and an
image then decides whether or not

201
00:12:21,470 --> 00:12:26,560
you notice your receipt chips at our
success and their

202
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:30,100
and there's also an alternative which
some people

203
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:33,800
I'm believe is offers more security
which

204
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:37,920
am essentially the same thing for a

205
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:41,700
so you got to take a pass redirect back
to mention Gatland mention every sense

206
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:42,100
here

207
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:45,450
home you post credit at the task
correctly

208
00:12:45,450 --> 00:12:49,709
to the timing that way buttons that a
payment gateway

209
00:12:49,709 --> 00:12:53,079
redirecting you back to the mansion with
the details

210
00:12:53,079 --> 00:12:57,579
it makes a POST request a record to a
hidden URL

211
00:12:57,579 --> 00:13:01,839
that suppose the only the merchant and
the time ago I know

212
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:05,899
on so the left post

213
00:13:05,899 --> 00:13:10,850
progress there medicine and now it's
like Alabama has been received

214
00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:15,019
and then I'm the timing I just basically
redirects a bacteria

215
00:13:15,019 --> 00:13:18,180
like a thank you page so this is you not
giving

216
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:21,660
transactional beat house or see details
for the brosser this why

217
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:27,709
I'm and this potentially a substantially
hotter for an attacker to nowhere

218
00:13:27,709 --> 00:13:31,550
the endpoint is to for attacked that

219
00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:35,240
yes um up I do he has the details Europe

220
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:39,250
on South there is a light but the policy
without

221
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:43,360
mattis if you're using open source
solution and using a plugin

222
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:46,579
Maceo as commerce and using them

223
00:13:46,579 --> 00:13:50,300
plugin for this time this topic coming
that way the return URL

224
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:53,310
stowaways the Siam in the pocket

225
00:13:53,310 --> 00:13:56,360
so in a and might be hidden but

226
00:13:56,360 --> 00:14:00,240
for at same time it's known if you look
at the source code of honor

227
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:04,430
and if it's a custom implementation
yurman still tend to

228
00:14:04,430 --> 00:14:08,750
name things in a sensible manner gene
you to just come looking for things like

229
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:12,310
return or time I'm received

230
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:16,579
top I just on the website I'm to be fine

231
00:14:16,579 --> 00:14:20,060
sup to finish this up just a straight
edge to my badge

232
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:23,440
and assess and I'm interested %uh

233
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:28,579
this also said integration which is
where the Managing Director speaks to

234
00:14:28,579 --> 00:14:32,660
I'm the time ago I saw this no customer
momentum at the deluxe sample that is

235
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:36,800
when you refund money and Customs
columns and their use

236
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:39,829
you sent me an iPad 2 screen was broke
and I'll send it back to him

237
00:14:39,829 --> 00:14:43,810
give me my money back add so the
customer has no involvement in this

238
00:14:43,810 --> 00:14:48,100
even though there's been a prior
transactions just I stayed a straight-up

239
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:52,180
self request typically up

240
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:55,639
and done money gets

241
00:14:55,639 --> 00:14:59,920
300 to the customer sup

242
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:03,930
if an attacker where to on Gallacher

243
00:15:03,930 --> 00:15:07,050
these and it is stopping transactions

244
00:15:07,050 --> 00:15:10,589
and this typically to rice you do this

245
00:15:10,589 --> 00:15:15,110
you either doing in this component where
it's transmitting the transactional

246
00:15:15,110 --> 00:15:15,800
dollar

247
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:20,740
to the time ago but to your own lot
young dude 302 redirect neural have

248
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:24,089
things like the amount dem thousand
dollars

249
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:27,600
you change that one dollar or and then
you pick the time and

250
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:31,980
and hopefully that the website on the
other end doesn't validate

251
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:35,230
yet that the payment amount matchless

252
00:15:35,230 --> 00:15:39,500
just just yet status is paid is a
receipt number

253
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:42,810
and it should show on your iPad or yeah
laptop whatever

254
00:15:42,810 --> 00:15:47,350
I'm and the other thing that's typically
done this to

255
00:15:47,350 --> 00:15:52,120
and just by pass the test steps to go
straight from the checkout page

256
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:56,220
and you got to the thank you time has
been received hi Jim just spit for

257
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:57,519
transactional

258
00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:02,190
detail I'm and since since the maginnis
disconnected from the time you get where

259
00:16:02,190 --> 00:16:04,079
they might not have a wide development

260
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:07,190
whether or not these details are correct

261
00:16:07,190 --> 00:16:11,000
and South done there are several

262
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,019
CD is applied to the stop attacks on the
onus on a comp

263
00:16:14,019 --> 00:16:17,600
us back to 2002

264
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:21,310
I'm but that does army the wonderfulness
that have been given a CV

265
00:16:21,310 --> 00:16:24,920
I mean the sinks dead back to life yeah
early 80s

266
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:28,610
probably and and it's there lies the
problem

267
00:16:28,610 --> 00:16:32,820
sup im traditional tax changed how much
just

268
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:36,620
and Europe tent change it to send

269
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:40,649
yeah and that's all this with sign a pic
or request television

270
00:16:40,649 --> 00:16:44,220
I or is 50 times were saved

271
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:48,290
I'm special this with response to a Best

272
00:16:48,290 --> 00:16:51,589
but you might ask what our questions on
selection its

273
00:16:51,589 --> 00:16:56,889
%uh as the band's name for a message
authentication code

274
00:16:56,889 --> 00:17:01,600
and typically it's sad up its all summer
fairy dress fingerprint see

275
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:04,870
signature et cetera but the best for the
team

276
00:17:04,870 --> 00:17:08,929
bash the details and NS and hash along
with it

277
00:17:08,929 --> 00:17:12,319
never had it so if you change the amount

278
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:15,699
in the transaction detail the hash in
along a matchless

279
00:17:15,699 --> 00:17:19,319
and the transaction gets border

280
00:17:19,319 --> 00:17:23,679
sup samples on request election
typically it on a protest the bottle

281
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:26,890
components of the transactions our the
actual URL

282
00:17:26,890 --> 00:17:31,640
in a redirect this quite page in law can
contain things like the customer

283
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:33,380
information

284
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:37,880
transactional da description on items
bought and shatter are

285
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:41,580
I'm so that our house the whole thing
they just act these are things that we

286
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:44,450
think are kind of important to develop
that whether or not

287
00:17:44,450 --> 00:17:48,700
other transaction this Balaton mature
the bed unchanged E

288
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:52,549
amount or the currency on

289
00:17:52,549 --> 00:17:56,280
some examples of this and them straight
up shop on

290
00:17:56,280 --> 00:18:00,100
the this things did the blue details are
the account

291
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:04,570
ID submits an account reference the red
is shared secret

292
00:18:04,570 --> 00:18:08,059
what's as meant to ensure that people
can just

293
00:18:08,059 --> 00:18:11,490
generate different hasher's biggest I
want have

294
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:15,280
all the messages at work yep b7

295
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:19,360
have initialization vector and and the
fog

296
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:22,760
different order of things so neither one
has an md5 on and if %ah

297
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:27,230
plus on the secret key an agency

298
00:18:27,230 --> 00:18:31,080
each implementation a slightly different
but they're also

299
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:36,289
very similar and some when he didn't
come get my skin's kinda get what has

300
00:18:36,289 --> 00:18:37,640
gone way up doing

301
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:42,450
things so from this item has been
inspected a slightly different

302
00:18:42,450 --> 00:18:45,919
but from past the Sun perspective it's
the same things like yep

303
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:50,299
generating hash and the house consists
of

304
00:18:50,299 --> 00:18:54,230
values plus yeah the secret should

305
00:18:54,230 --> 00:18:58,080
secret and response to that since the
same thing on a protest the muddy

306
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:59,250
Charles

307
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:04,080
I'm to be that just makes my day the
transaction ID and the amount

308
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:07,940
I'm sup examples of that can see it's
they're almost

309
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:12,090
the sign as the initial amount know if
the initial example which was request

310
00:19:12,090 --> 00:19:13,260
elevation

311
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:17,309
sorpresa lessons applied when by the
mission

312
00:19:17,309 --> 00:19:21,350
when it's sending the user the customer
to the timing I'm

313
00:19:21,350 --> 00:19:24,760
and the response on a national issues by
the time to get wired when you're

314
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:27,600
sending the user back to the mansion

315
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:31,419
I'm and South the shared secret

316
00:19:31,419 --> 00:19:34,820
this known to both mentioned and the
timing at one so

317
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:39,500
all the rustic couldn't possibly Vella
that um

318
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:42,620
so when you're dealing with request a
response on the National you have a

319
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:43,039
couple

320
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:46,470
options you can bypass the lesson

321
00:19:46,470 --> 00:19:51,440
you can abuse on the cryptographic
properties or you can defeat validation

322
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:54,960
what's eliminates the use some singers
altogether

323
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:58,870
really on to typical by Stu

324
00:19:58,870 --> 00:20:02,580
by possible is I G deeper under Bush

325
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:05,700
semester you define the same parameter
more than once

326
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:09,610
hopefully the I'm if it's wonderful

327
00:20:09,610 --> 00:20:13,490
the ash checked Sinjin check when used
in 1st parameter and then the actual

328
00:20:13,490 --> 00:20:17,600
charging cord will use the second
parameter and to click something that is

329
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:22,270
I'm in a a php page receives it in that
sense it yourself back and

330
00:20:22,270 --> 00:20:26,460
where having two elements defined in XML
core sex multi-use

331
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:30,890
letter on now you can abuse unprotected
parameters so

332
00:20:30,890 --> 00:20:34,169
since they only protect the bottle brown
purse up transaction

333
00:20:34,169 --> 00:20:39,370
safe yours buy a subscription service
you just modified expiry dates I'll

334
00:20:39,370 --> 00:20:43,370
you still painful process but instead of
having a service expire after Mon

335
00:20:43,370 --> 00:20:47,100
they'll expire after in a a century or
more

336
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:50,230
I'm which basically means that your
getting a list of free

337
00:20:50,230 --> 00:20:54,230
and this also are abuse application
logic

338
00:20:54,230 --> 00:20:59,110
example this is up and a big payoff
application I

339
00:20:59,110 --> 00:21:02,169
or pre or post for I membership

340
00:21:02,169 --> 00:21:05,600
and some having at WES have base where

341
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:10,110
on instead of having a transaction
details change in order to Mac

342
00:21:10,110 --> 00:21:13,340
the transaction change from a charge to
just pre or

343
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:16,429
often amount and the have an additional
parameter

344
00:21:16,429 --> 00:21:19,850
which isn'ta up the singer so

345
00:21:19,850 --> 00:21:23,120
you can this parameter and stunts are
you cannot

346
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:26,770
it generates exactly the same details
back to that

347
00:21:26,770 --> 00:21:30,100
mentioned but with the addition primer

348
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:33,770
free of one and so if the

349
00:21:33,770 --> 00:21:36,820
validation code doesn't check for the
presence a priori

350
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:40,010
all the other parameters are identical
and something up

351
00:21:40,010 --> 00:21:43,600
all been paid 50 bucks buttons that it's
just pre-authorized

352
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:47,780
50 bucks sup I'm

353
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:51,440
at if you can't can you send it to us

354
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:55,520
you might be able to a tactic rip same
the examples that we saw

355
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:59,090
they're using and the file shot while

356
00:21:59,090 --> 00:22:04,350
now they're typically bundles length
extension tax it's a lot easier on md5

357
00:22:04,350 --> 00:22:05,710
the medicine shop on

358
00:22:05,710 --> 00:22:10,169
missed but I'm sure she researched to
and so the peach I wanna stop

359
00:22:10,169 --> 00:22:15,120
I M if you don mackey let extension
attack this the short

360
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:18,830
description is that hashing algorithm
works on a

361
00:22:18,830 --> 00:22:22,179
a us Chanda said I'm on a botched

362
00:22:22,179 --> 00:22:25,549
amended if it does I'm not but still pad

363
00:22:25,549 --> 00:22:31,020
benefited has more bites it'll sup
compress the middle section a bit

364
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:34,919
I'm and what you can do is without
knowing them

365
00:22:34,919 --> 00:22:38,110
the big key which is kinda discuss

366
00:22:38,110 --> 00:22:41,750
you can at patting and then append

367
00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:45,539
a different message switches and two in
this case and because of the way

368
00:22:45,539 --> 00:22:49,330
that the block chaining where X you will
actually

369
00:22:49,330 --> 00:22:53,330
this job the unknown donna

370
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:57,190
and summer over I did your daughter
seeking have chewed

371
00:22:57,190 --> 00:23:00,669
different messages or you can append

372
00:23:00,669 --> 00:23:03,809
padding and a different message to date

373
00:23:03,809 --> 00:23:08,620
do that non the Tulsa signature
transaction data and actually have the

374
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:09,080
hash

375
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:14,280
Clark on end up waking possible
aggression checks

376
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:18,620
I'm sadly like extension tax are pretty
costly

377
00:23:18,620 --> 00:23:24,059
I'm I wouldn't you have to do it on a
pair transactional basis

378
00:23:24,059 --> 00:23:27,270
finding md5 collisions even is

379
00:23:27,270 --> 00:23:31,010
with all the advancements in crypto it
still a CPU intensive

380
00:23:31,010 --> 00:23:34,130
exercise so

381
00:23:34,130 --> 00:23:37,480
I'm there are a much better solution on

382
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:41,250
was just defeat to request on the
measure the way you go about that

383
00:23:41,250 --> 00:23:45,059
is you look at how the fingerprint this
matter

384
00:23:45,059 --> 00:23:48,880
be some details that the service/site
script mitchen

385
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:52,559
website used to generate request
election

386
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:55,799
sup nearby to the Telus this merchant
account ID

387
00:23:55,799 --> 00:23:59,990
this is seeking shaky transaction time
preference

388
00:23:59,990 --> 00:24:03,610
ID a mountain at times to on

389
00:24:03,610 --> 00:24:07,350
and then the brosser submits the
following information:

390
00:24:07,350 --> 00:24:11,340
to the panic gala a smidge muddy
transaction top reference ID amount

391
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:12,929
times that and a fingerprint

392
00:24:12,929 --> 00:24:17,289
as well as a result europe I'm there are
often additional parameters but these

393
00:24:17,289 --> 00:24:17,970
are the ones that

394
00:24:17,970 --> 00:24:22,600
so the matter so if we compare them side
by side and

395
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:25,870
and see that basically the site now

396
00:24:25,870 --> 00:24:29,150
so you might already see the problem
here but

397
00:24:29,150 --> 00:24:33,010
let me holla for you we have a non
password

398
00:24:33,010 --> 00:24:37,240
and then on hash within the whole buncha
other

399
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:43,169
I'm text upset effectively we can't read
the rest the plaintext

400
00:24:43,169 --> 00:24:49,870
assault and just apply standard possum
cracking techniques

401
00:24:49,870 --> 00:24:53,960
now the shared secret it's usually
bender supply

402
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:58,600
another chain just in fact there is no
option electron you have to open support

403
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:00,390
request white for like a week

404
00:25:00,390 --> 00:25:04,320
and as soon as they change the key your
website is broken because

405
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:08,299
you have the wrong key in now signatures
done match anymore

406
00:25:08,299 --> 00:25:11,400
as a demeanor changes I'm and

407
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:15,169
furthermore it's often converted to
uppercase a lower castes just to make it

408
00:25:15,169 --> 00:25:16,029
easier for

409
00:25:16,029 --> 00:25:19,610
developers not to screw up I but I just
stacks the odds

410
00:25:19,610 --> 00:25:24,120
further in debt attack this fire is now
you keys by said you have to brute-force

411
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:27,299
is significantly reduced

412
00:25:27,299 --> 00:25:30,970
and South an attacker could just sign up
to the timing out whether their

413
00:25:30,970 --> 00:25:34,330
look into abuse receive one of these
codes

414
00:25:34,330 --> 00:25:37,400
and because the yeah supply by the
vendor that

415
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:41,500
would typically but you know how long it
is what kinda complex the dealing with

416
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:42,520
it

417
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:46,580
and then just you optimizer
possum-catching called for

418
00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:50,600
that and so what we eat what I'm usually
seen

419
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:55,059
involve us apart from other dump and has
been used typically it's at characters

420
00:25:55,059 --> 00:25:59,340
of bad to its

421
00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:04,250
really bad isobars complexity and there
are some that includes medicare after a

422
00:26:04,250 --> 00:26:04,870
spotter

423
00:26:04,870 --> 00:26:08,559
I'm they tend to be psyched and so you
know on

424
00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:12,779
to prevent things like an apostrophe
breaking it because some SQL injection

425
00:26:12,779 --> 00:26:15,880
by 10 status on a up a case like ice

426
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:22,090
I'm and even if the use of it as like as
complex as a sometimes the casket to up

427
00:26:22,090 --> 00:26:24,890
the cash or to lower caste and actually
defeat their own

428
00:26:24,890 --> 00:26:28,820
pasta complexity I'm in general

429
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:32,409
I know one another time ago whether uses
10 character passwords

430
00:26:32,409 --> 00:26:35,500
the market morton this particular one
but I'm

431
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:39,120
even kindness is not strong enough that
big cab endorse

432
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:44,510
used 32 character tax value did ride
from I i jus and

433
00:26:44,510 --> 00:26:49,070
and the ones I have spoken to are
already in the process of moving to 64

434
00:26:49,070 --> 00:26:49,860
character

435
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:53,580
a shit secret and

436
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:56,630
if you're dealing with does she have to
pull back on their keylex

437
00:26:56,630 --> 00:27:01,380
extension because you can crack them and
yurman lost time

438
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:05,330
sup when you want to crack this sticking
it to the club

439
00:27:05,330 --> 00:27:08,870
biggest everything's in the club next s
I'm

440
00:27:08,870 --> 00:27:13,490
why is the club I'll brother donato ball
I'm

441
00:27:13,490 --> 00:27:19,039
dedicated cracking hardware setting it
up and you can just hop on Amazon

442
00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:22,860
launch supplements insists ass on office
GP you

443
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:27,520
I'm I think don't think you told us yet
but I'm sure it's in the pokémon

444
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:30,520
on find a readily available image

445
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:34,120
said I'm had to do the install and
typically there's like a shell script

446
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:35,320
that you can just run

447
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:38,730
federal install all the development
lovers for you

448
00:27:38,730 --> 00:27:43,470
and you know within five minutes a
pittance da on your instance an Amazon

449
00:27:43,470 --> 00:27:47,779
you're up and running I'm and Udall some
make that elastic

450
00:27:47,779 --> 00:27:50,860
if you're not using GPUs you cannot

451
00:27:50,860 --> 00:27:54,630
elastic and graphics cats

452
00:27:54,630 --> 00:27:58,029
South a you can for example use John the
Ripper

453
00:27:58,029 --> 00:28:01,279
dollar a present right support for
dynamic formats

454
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:05,590
I'm I recommend getting the jumper
distribution it comes with all the good

455
00:28:05,590 --> 00:28:11,850
user-supplied patches I'm it supports
distributed cracking over in PRC can

456
00:28:11,850 --> 00:28:14,870
you can far as many instances as you
want or you can just

457
00:28:14,870 --> 00:28:18,020
use at elastic BS a

458
00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:21,100
John the Ripper doesn't require jib you

459
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:24,720
and you can also use both screwed up an
open CL

460
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:28,659
with John if you're using the Jumbo
distribution how r abour

461
00:28:28,659 --> 00:28:33,640
the cuter lottery so the two dakotas is
sadly lacking and the open sea al

462
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:36,669
it's not really up to moscow performance

463
00:28:36,669 --> 00:28:40,070
cell well it is available and if you're

464
00:28:40,070 --> 00:28:43,279
gap to write your own home open Cliq to
kennels

465
00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:46,980
%uh I don't see why you should not use
John the Ripper for this

466
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:51,000
I'm so even if you didn't go in and just

467
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:54,230
fauna dynamic format I'm Sun discuss

468
00:28:54,230 --> 00:28:58,010
up im bitch

469
00:28:58,010 --> 00:29:01,210
on so just credited

470
00:29:01,210 --> 00:29:05,559
a singer there and then down here

471
00:29:05,559 --> 00:29:10,330
with site map take train bus or stop by
adding some salt stand up and the

472
00:29:10,330 --> 00:29:11,110
password

473
00:29:11,110 --> 00:29:14,380
adds more salt and anchored at md5

474
00:29:14,380 --> 00:29:18,630
and effectively we include a test which
contains

475
00:29:18,630 --> 00:29:22,890
this bit here is step and resolve hashed

476
00:29:22,890 --> 00:29:26,669
is the first salts is the second salts

477
00:29:26,669 --> 00:29:30,580
all the way down there and that's what
the password be

478
00:29:30,580 --> 00:29:34,270
and then develop that could use in
jonathan's test format

479
00:29:34,270 --> 00:29:39,860
other format you defined if you are
using John I would recommend you also up

480
00:29:39,860 --> 00:29:40,360
but

481
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:44,370
Jonathan Cahn to use a specific John but
comes to make sure that

482
00:29:44,370 --> 00:29:48,690
you max the password complexity in
characterised smallest like

483
00:29:48,690 --> 00:29:53,570
in a which character sets using as a lot
john looked waste a lot on

484
00:29:53,570 --> 00:29:57,110
cracking yes shorter hospital longer
passwords

485
00:29:57,110 --> 00:30:01,080
made a character saddam necessarily
belong in there

486
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:04,830
on so and what you would need not to do
that

487
00:30:04,830 --> 00:30:08,179
you have been Coco here which on

488
00:30:08,179 --> 00:30:11,929
this does not so wheres this a talk on
it but I am

489
00:30:11,929 --> 00:30:15,760
the concert this is Sammy lot in the
form you find a little moments that

490
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:16,940
you're after

491
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:20,070
and then just print model us on

492
00:30:20,070 --> 00:30:23,940
Assad dynamic cache there

493
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:27,039
and then you put that in a in a far
honey just

494
00:30:27,039 --> 00:30:30,130
that John have a go at it nope

495
00:30:30,130 --> 00:30:33,279
and if you are using John when jumbo you
can

496
00:30:33,279 --> 00:30:37,159
up that the Mac fall tonight Olympia on
seeking to distributed cracking across

497
00:30:37,159 --> 00:30:38,240
multiple hosts

498
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:41,909
I'm just pretty easy to set up try to
host file

499
00:30:41,909 --> 00:30:45,070
and I'll SSI justification for you sir

500
00:30:45,070 --> 00:30:48,110
i ed key best and cash in saree

501
00:30:48,110 --> 00:30:52,580
Cumberland passwords and then basically
use and pixx

502
00:30:52,580 --> 00:30:55,789
don't John with whatever problems you
would normally do and then

503
00:30:55,789 --> 00:30:58,990
and got takes care of the rest so add

504
00:30:58,990 --> 00:31:04,390
its release ec2 distributed I'm stock
within the hour

505
00:31:04,390 --> 00:31:07,909
%uh however you better off using debut

506
00:31:07,909 --> 00:31:11,510
ed correctly up from sit here perhaps
calculations

507
00:31:11,510 --> 00:31:14,860
I'm scouts but that number Jeff you
course a device s

508
00:31:14,860 --> 00:31:20,039
but you had in in your box and you can
use by the Qatar Open CL depending on

509
00:31:20,039 --> 00:31:21,490
what the boss is she had

510
00:31:21,490 --> 00:31:25,070
and non Plaza some Subrata 7 Amazon

511
00:31:25,070 --> 00:31:29,640
Office India so you can use are the cute
our on sale

512
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:34,640
s2 why we choose one or the other it
really comes down to personal preference

513
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:39,460
on most the modern tools tend to use
open CL simply because

514
00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:42,570
chewed on Lee Westwood Nvidia OpenGL
let's whip

515
00:31:42,570 --> 00:31:47,500
a plethora of things on there are some
technical dif

516
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:51,120
Francis & Sons that I could I have to
manage on threading

517
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:55,010
more than that on CL some managed
distribution I'm

518
00:31:55,010 --> 00:31:58,080
tasks across the number of course you
have available

519
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:02,890
I'm however since of 100 a lot easier to
deal with them

520
00:32:02,890 --> 00:32:07,480
populous I could see coding and and pop
guess could actually lost to do some

521
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:08,110
things that

522
00:32:08,110 --> 00:32:13,309
on missus selig right with block a
buffer offset some point traversed cell

523
00:32:13,309 --> 00:32:16,399
I'm are uninsured up but

524
00:32:16,399 --> 00:32:19,769
the star is my good news on sale and

525
00:32:19,769 --> 00:32:22,549
this planning to open source up so that
you can use to build on you don't

526
00:32:22,549 --> 00:32:24,799
necessarily have to build a cracker from
stock

527
00:32:24,799 --> 00:32:28,690
John the Ripper like to mention crypto
has halted for serbs another

528
00:32:28,690 --> 00:32:32,230
very comprehensive GPS tracker are you
sis

529
00:32:32,230 --> 00:32:35,990
up a CL and supports distributed crackin

530
00:32:35,990 --> 00:32:39,830
I've been does news MPI assets on
services like mobile

531
00:32:39,830 --> 00:32:44,279
I wise cracker had a plywood

532
00:32:44,279 --> 00:32:48,840
uses up in Sea Isle and dust distributed
cracking over

533
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:52,929
and PRI but it's basically just a a
proof-of-concept

534
00:32:52,929 --> 00:32:56,100
what pics 0 and dad

535
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:59,130
defused if you cracker sand %uh

536
00:32:59,130 --> 00:33:02,950
judah best one that supports multiple
salsa a base model not

537
00:33:02,950 --> 00:33:07,690
a shelter a good have a look and see
what can also see what some context I'll

538
00:33:07,690 --> 00:33:08,970
be happy with and just

539
00:33:08,970 --> 00:33:12,950
run it from there on there are other
alternatives but

540
00:33:12,950 --> 00:33:18,110
the San Juans tonight so I went sup for
the demo we gonna demo

541
00:33:18,110 --> 00:33:21,610
mom a number of different things

542
00:33:21,610 --> 00:33:24,789
on nothing Coast up of

543
00:33:24,789 --> 00:33:28,630
with a/c

544
00:33:28,630 --> 00:33:33,890
use

545
00:33:33,890 --> 00:33:37,200
them

546
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:42,190
I check

547
00:33:42,190 --> 00:33:46,409
are

548
00:33:46,409 --> 00:33:49,470
and mister back that's right so

549
00:33:49,470 --> 00:33:52,620
on the first time I was going to be
based around the fact that

550
00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:56,000
if you have a hidden return to
television page

551
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:59,529
and you can just brute force it Serena
very message

552
00:33:59,529 --> 00:34:05,779
bird for scripted spits out a whole
bundle on C

553
00:34:05,779 --> 00:34:08,810
decide that and a better user

554
00:34:08,810 --> 00:34:12,540
but because the fall season choose to
love that into bed

555
00:34:12,540 --> 00:34:16,770
or and Papa W get I've got this

556
00:34:16,770 --> 00:34:21,889
sir split up to the top and if you can
read that but it was later

557
00:34:21,889 --> 00:34:25,220
runs it for the second brevity I your

558
00:34:25,220 --> 00:34:28,619
I only grabbed for the ones that are
relevant and then

559
00:34:28,619 --> 00:34:33,619
in the loop ado had requests and if that
had request for 10 to 200 OK

560
00:34:33,619 --> 00:34:38,139
I'll echo the Euro so Iran that against

561
00:34:38,139 --> 00:34:41,639
my webshop instance air

562
00:34:41,639 --> 00:34:48,639
should come back fairly quickly with I'm
the bell in Europe

563
00:34:48,929 --> 00:34:52,030
day sup if that was like yeah

564
00:34:52,030 --> 00:34:55,899
a hidden URL you get some stuff on it
just is

565
00:34:55,899 --> 00:34:59,730
humans tend to name the sings in a in a
sensible manner

566
00:34:59,730 --> 00:35:03,160
a.m. and then once you find that you can

567
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:07,940
proceed with the other attacks I'm sorry

568
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:12,960
are nerves this

569
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:16,290
and some sup

570
00:35:16,290 --> 00:35:20,869
I'm I'm

571
00:35:20,869 --> 00:35:25,140
and I'm so we've got our webshop

572
00:35:25,140 --> 00:35:30,670
and I'm and stuff I'm gonna buy a
Macbook Air

573
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:34,070
good price I'm stay with her

574
00:35:34,070 --> 00:35:38,950
I'm forgot to check up page said

575
00:35:38,950 --> 00:35:42,260
well just register as a new user and

576
00:35:42,260 --> 00:35:47,339
the them

577
00:35:47,339 --> 00:35:50,470
pins

578
00:35:50,470 --> 00:35:54,099
may be a sign that marched working on
small

579
00:35:54,099 --> 00:36:01,099
on then summer

580
00:36:15,619 --> 00:36:21,970
did some first northern get it done

581
00:36:21,970 --> 00:36:26,420
script on a bid

582
00:36:26,420 --> 00:36:33,420
apps sorry acted just like this time
that

583
00:36:36,730 --> 00:36:43,730
them on

584
00:36:50,799 --> 00:36:55,180
any should've tried to the demigods

585
00:36:55,180 --> 00:36:59,609
so it

586
00:36:59,609 --> 00:37:04,039
or

587
00:37:04,039 --> 00:37:08,329
an error

588
00:37:08,329 --> 00:37:11,779
you and

589
00:37:11,779 --> 00:37:18,779
our your

590
00:37:20,930 --> 00:37:27,009
thank you for that on agreed to terms of
services such

591
00:37:27,009 --> 00:37:30,089
and then on instead of actually making
the payment

592
00:37:30,089 --> 00:37:34,200
will learn get the dumb source

593
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:37,349
select that on

594
00:37:37,349 --> 00:37:42,819
said that Ange good order

595
00:37:42,819 --> 00:37:47,930
go back and read them a

596
00:37:47,930 --> 00:37:50,950
and so

597
00:37:50,950 --> 00:37:54,230
which gives us

598
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:58,440
this dynamic cash which news and John
the Ripper

599
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:02,710
so I'm

600
00:38:02,710 --> 00:38:05,920
I go to my books in the cloud

601
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:12,569
I can

602
00:38:12,569 --> 00:38:18,380
its around this before

603
00:38:18,380 --> 00:38:22,609
on the sad thing about licensee this
since been running for over two hours

604
00:38:22,609 --> 00:38:26,599
I John the Ripper it's not particularly
fast

605
00:38:26,599 --> 00:38:29,869
when you see GP assert sepia

606
00:38:29,869 --> 00:38:33,329
so and brother buildings on the river

607
00:38:33,329 --> 00:38:36,960
will love them cracked this and I'm

608
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:42,420
creature mmm

609
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:46,779
sana

610
00:38:46,779 --> 00:38:52,420
in

611
00:38:52,420 --> 00:38:56,440
slightly different miscast

612
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:59,690
Texas arguments some lacy

613
00:38:59,690 --> 00:39:05,849
sandals and I'm

614
00:39:05,849 --> 00:39:12,430
this but here's the hash that we're
going to crack and then

615
00:39:12,430 --> 00:39:16,849
given assault from the her the password

616
00:39:16,849 --> 00:39:20,519
an assault that the behind the password

617
00:39:20,519 --> 00:39:23,519
and another is a six characters now

618
00:39:23,519 --> 00:39:27,400
I'm chosen six just because I want that
demagogued foster

619
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:30,930
I'm the best view justice based on what
time and get right

620
00:39:30,930 --> 00:39:34,190
you would be targeting the stale they're
all slightly different

621
00:39:34,190 --> 00:39:41,190
so this cash this case certainly isn't

622
00:39:41,619 --> 00:39:44,819
the not there just

623
00:39:44,819 --> 00:39:48,900
SanDisk s that's the pass for their

624
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:54,400
once and on the password I can go back
into montana

625
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:58,460
and I can sign their crest from border

626
00:39:58,460 --> 00:40:03,220
with the password um

627
00:40:03,220 --> 00:40:06,849
Jared I'm message speed the transaction
ID

628
00:40:06,849 --> 00:40:10,019
sign this on and then basically they

629
00:40:10,019 --> 00:40:15,400
given this europe to this I just

630
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:19,430
what we do this am in a new orders

631
00:40:19,430 --> 00:40:23,999
in in my webshop go back to this on

632
00:40:23,999 --> 00:40:29,569
well done

633
00:40:29,569 --> 00:40:32,609
this is a test huge tits

634
00:40:32,609 --> 00:40:36,539
your own slather

635
00:40:36,539 --> 00:40:43,290
worker

636
00:40:43,290 --> 00:40:47,190
I'm sup water content number

637
00:40:47,190 --> 00:40:50,200
6 and then if we go in

638
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:53,970
to my shop here

639
00:40:53,970 --> 00:41:00,770
can see here I have a new order

am I'm an accepted as you say that

641
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:08,809
in the impact on

642
00:41:08,809 --> 00:41:12,710
we can also take advantage %uh
unprotected

643
00:41:12,710 --> 00:41:16,599
parameters in this case subs sorry on

644
00:41:16,599 --> 00:41:20,329
Coast dumb selection but this one am

645
00:41:20,329 --> 00:41:24,380
on so what we'll do this poll on

646
00:41:24,380 --> 00:41:27,690
will make another order for the same
amount

647
00:41:27,690 --> 00:41:31,940
am

648
00:41:31,940 --> 00:41:35,470
on this time registered as a different
user

649
00:41:35,470 --> 00:41:42,470
miss them

650
00:41:52,470 --> 00:41:56,500
scroll down a bit Andrews

651
00:41:56,500 --> 00:42:03,500
on

652
00:42:09,330 --> 00:42:16,330
that's not gonna cat lenses the river

653
00:42:16,510 --> 00:42:20,060
the she agreed to terms service on this

654
00:42:20,060 --> 00:42:23,720
this Tom I'm gonna bother getting the
dome obvious

655
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:28,790
on the shopping can I the subsequent on
since no one else is using it

656
00:42:28,790 --> 00:42:33,200
I would normally extractor shopping can
I DM and is

657
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:36,560
in this case the shopping cart ID is
being random

658
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:39,610
in a hour I'm like this

659
00:42:39,610 --> 00:42:43,350
so does and he's been included here

660
00:42:43,350 --> 00:42:47,120
as a custom rayburn and it's not
protected

661
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:51,130
by the signature or just tacked on that
we used for

662
00:42:51,130 --> 00:42:55,120
chopping come a seventy or do we just
passed will rerun it miss come well

663
00:42:55,120 --> 00:42:59,800
I'm a Mac shopping cart number right and
on

664
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:03,960
that will run for let Wall air

665
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:10,950
I'm

666
00:43:10,950 --> 00:43:15,120
contempt this time warner ides sir 7

667
00:43:15,120 --> 00:43:18,920
get back in here so all orders

668
00:43:18,920 --> 00:43:22,350
and seven here you can see that it says
de materia

669
00:43:22,350 --> 00:43:26,360
I'm interested even though we didn't
pass our

670
00:43:26,360 --> 00:43:29,930
I'm it's also vulnerable to reply
attacks in

671
00:43:29,930 --> 00:43:33,160
on up

672
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:36,230
unprotected premier tampering

673
00:43:36,230 --> 00:43:40,680
sup on not for my next trick

674
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:46,510
cash estrich

675
00:43:46,510 --> 00:43:51,340
I'm gonna be looking at a I'm ASCO
injections so

676
00:43:51,340 --> 00:43:55,740
I'm if I get should get this on

677
00:43:55,740 --> 00:44:02,220
hand

678
00:44:02,220 --> 00:44:05,370
I

679
00:44:05,370 --> 00:44:12,370
said on

680
00:44:14,670 --> 00:44:15,370
NHA

681
00:44:15,370 --> 00:44:20,800
had this nom

682
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:24,830
this issue

683
00:44:24,830 --> 00:44:29,640
am gone have a look I'm

684
00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:33,260
the M here see that

685
00:44:33,260 --> 00:44:40,260
runs Lasko truck seem and I have and

686
00:44:40,780 --> 00:44:44,010
is a nice girl injection this here

687
00:44:44,010 --> 00:44:51,010
see anything

688
00:44:54,370 --> 00:44:56,650
as a priori I am

689
00:44:56,650 --> 00:45:01,270
growth let's go injection

690
00:45:01,270 --> 00:45:04,930
part of the problem with having s gonna
Jackson's

691
00:45:04,930 --> 00:45:08,770
and this message that the shared secret
has to be stored in plain text

692
00:45:08,770 --> 00:45:12,210
ended on a nice an order for our the

693
00:45:12,210 --> 00:45:16,130
I'm imagine to be able to develop night
the requests come and

694
00:45:16,130 --> 00:45:19,160
that the sauna this case we could hamper

695
00:45:19,160 --> 00:45:23,040
go visit

696
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:26,850
this year I'll us

697
00:45:26,850 --> 00:45:29,950
sided

698
00:45:29,950 --> 00:45:36,950
communist either

699
00:45:38,049 --> 00:45:41,450
and so if we do typical example

700
00:45:41,450 --> 00:45:48,450
you a cosby I'm

701
00:45:48,760 --> 00:45:52,030
a ser I or be in that doesn't really
help

702
00:45:52,030 --> 00:45:56,710
on sits a sub select

703
00:45:56,710 --> 00:45:59,839
and better example I guess is

704
00:45:59,839 --> 00:46:03,349
the Brecker record like that and said
let's try to write

705
00:46:03,349 --> 00:46:07,730
ringo here see that Moscow proxies
picked up

706
00:46:07,730 --> 00:46:10,730
SQL injection put

707
00:46:10,730 --> 00:46:14,770
and also the page a lot for this as very
fast

708
00:46:14,770 --> 00:46:19,329
so once we take it back and this girl
stands where Kim

709
00:46:19,329 --> 00:46:22,579
on the benchmarks makes it straightens
up

710
00:46:22,579 --> 00:46:26,520
to blind SQL injection do that extract
the password

711
00:46:26,520 --> 00:46:29,819
Cup a character stats and take you that
long once you have that

712
00:46:29,819 --> 00:46:32,970
you cannot straight up up spew

713
00:46:32,970 --> 00:46:36,559
hijacked the idea access on behalf
mentioned

714
00:46:36,559 --> 00:46:39,809
on now with this one and they also

715
00:46:39,809 --> 00:46:42,900
happened to be quite helpful

716
00:46:42,900 --> 00:46:46,730
ahead for have a debug like

717
00:46:46,730 --> 00:46:49,940
of club coke rests my brother

718
00:46:49,940 --> 00:46:53,839
the module and so what we can do with
that this summer

719
00:46:53,839 --> 00:46:58,380
just extract EM

720
00:46:58,380 --> 00:47:04,640
and start from this if we get our to
this

721
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:10,339
a nice

722
00:47:10,339 --> 00:47:17,339
this is ever get

723
00:47:17,339 --> 00:47:21,040
had to be basic and there and then on

724
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:24,780
you basically pop that into base64
decode

725
00:47:24,780 --> 00:47:27,790
get you some apostles try to Lhasa I'm
just

726
00:47:27,790 --> 00:47:34,790
and on

727
00:47:42,900 --> 00:47:46,380
apps

728
00:47:46,380 --> 00:47:53,380
now and again

729
00:48:02,229 --> 00:48:02,589
should

730
00:48:02,589 --> 00:48:08,149
Ian %uh

731
00:48:08,149 --> 00:48:15,149
first am sale say there it's

732
00:48:22,999 --> 00:48:26,149
that's the reason I'm sup a certain
someone 23

733
00:48:26,149 --> 00:48:29,609
and then bassist for complaints because
it's got up

734
00:48:29,609 --> 00:48:34,199
das and line endings for that's not a
problem

735
00:48:34,199 --> 00:48:38,699
so hom as you can see from some in the
last two bikes

736
00:48:38,699 --> 00:48:45,039
I'm a season last two text

737
00:48:45,039 --> 00:48:49,189
is has a proper resolution

738
00:48:49,189 --> 00:48:56,189
on

739
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:04,290
second and

740
00:49:04,290 --> 00:49:10,710
on so um once you have access to the
idea I had eaten sonic rests on the

741
00:49:10,710 --> 00:49:11,790
other things you can do is

742
00:49:11,790 --> 00:49:15,410
issue you're on refunds so rather than
speech impairments

743
00:49:15,410 --> 00:49:19,120
you can actually make a genuine payment
the comment will appear in

744
00:49:19,120 --> 00:49:22,650
mentions account you'll get the goods
and then you just

745
00:49:22,650 --> 00:49:26,210
refund Ron transaction on

746
00:49:26,210 --> 00:49:30,040
and if you're feeling particularly evil
even to sleep through

747
00:49:30,040 --> 00:49:33,490
every possible transaction and refund
all 'em I

748
00:49:33,490 --> 00:49:37,600
we just which is a good way to get rid
of the competition I suppose

749
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:41,370
I dhahran incantation

750
00:49:41,370 --> 00:49:45,320
don't rely on the brosser drug traffic
between them its website and time ago I

751
00:49:45,320 --> 00:49:46,180
i'm

752
00:49:46,180 --> 00:49:49,390
crypto is pretty hot %um

753
00:49:49,390 --> 00:49:52,600
you can either use more than one on on
variable n

754
00:49:52,600 --> 00:49:56,080
request from national years-long secret
or even better

755
00:49:56,080 --> 00:50:00,590
used token best redirection so that the
brosser never touched

756
00:50:00,590 --> 00:50:03,630
and have the transaction details on

757
00:50:03,630 --> 00:50:07,710
salsa recommended that %um you protect
all the parameters

758
00:50:07,710 --> 00:50:12,730
Houston request use hedge maxim that you
cannot be attacked with killing

759
00:50:12,730 --> 00:50:16,730
extension attacks I'm gonna

760
00:50:16,730 --> 00:50:21,030
however even if the have weak request on
a national doesn't necessarily

761
00:50:21,030 --> 00:50:24,330
mean that have an exploitable
vulnerabilities there are some

762
00:50:24,330 --> 00:50:25,810
mitigating factors around

763
00:50:25,810 --> 00:50:29,480
I'm you know a

764
00:50:29,480 --> 00:50:33,400
likely they're always be implementation
bikes which makes me happy and keeps

765
00:50:33,400 --> 00:50:33,910
mean

766
00:50:33,910 --> 00:50:39,660
job I I'm if you do want to look about
bikes and I go and compassion

767
00:50:39,660 --> 00:50:44,910
I'm the falling prices are few good
places to look honorable bender cock

768
00:50:44,910 --> 00:50:48,040
no I'm tree publishing so it's and

769
00:50:48,040 --> 00:50:51,870
about SSL practices this one is

770
00:50:51,870 --> 00:50:55,250
absolutely everywhere it was like a bike
in PHP

771
00:50:55,250 --> 00:51:00,500
I'm that it wouldn't work with certain
certain conditions a certain price

772
00:51:00,500 --> 00:51:01,470
levels a Windows

773
00:51:01,470 --> 00:51:04,570
so basically every PHP developer ever

774
00:51:04,570 --> 00:51:07,920
to avoid breakage turns out SSL
verification

775
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:11,590
by the foot I and even if you do and I
let

776
00:51:11,590 --> 00:51:14,890
and all divisions of PHP

777
00:51:14,890 --> 00:51:19,260
add having in noble it didn't actually
do correct validation set

778
00:51:19,260 --> 00:51:22,340
in so man in Middleham I benefits

790
00:52:01,950 --> 00:52:06,590
comparison operator I'm page you were
