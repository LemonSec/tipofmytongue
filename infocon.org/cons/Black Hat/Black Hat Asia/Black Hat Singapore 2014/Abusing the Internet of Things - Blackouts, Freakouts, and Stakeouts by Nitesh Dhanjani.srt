1
00:00:00,199 --> 00:00:04,600
so today I'm gonna talk to you about the
security implications

2
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:08,630
up the consumer side I O teast which
stands for Internet of Things

3
00:00:08,630 --> 00:00:11,790
so I my friend then

4
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:14,790
X Khalid Billy Rios yesterday talked
about

5
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:19,020
infrastructure from an enterprise
perspective that you can also kinda

6
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:20,920
demand within the IRT Spanish

7
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:24,119
but my focus in school is on consumer
grade

8
00:00:24,119 --> 00:00:28,150
IRT devices so before we get

9
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:31,789
into the good stuff let's just take a
step back and ask ourselves why this is

10
00:00:31,789 --> 00:00:32,910
important question

11
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:39,110
or important discussion to have in the
first place we estimate that by

12
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:44,450
2020 to from a consumer side perspective
when I mean that consumers been able to

13
00:00:44,450 --> 00:00:45,940
walk into the Apple Store

14
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:50,100
on go online to an electronics store and
be able to purchase

15
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:53,570
IRT devices and install it yourself

16
00:00:53,570 --> 00:00:58,289
and I O T device is the definition of
censure based devices

17
00:00:58,289 --> 00:01:02,449
that connect our physical world to a
larger world

18
00:01:02,449 --> 00:01:06,040
and by 2020 we estimate that

19
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:09,340
police in the affluent nations across
the world

20
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:13,200
but there will be about $50 billion I RT
devices

21
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,860
devices such as online thermostats

22
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:20,640
prejudice sprinklers on

23
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,610
door locks lightbulbs and

24
00:01:24,610 --> 00:01:27,790
by 2020 we also estimate that a

25
00:01:27,790 --> 00:01:31,909
average into individual have about 35 to
50 lysette

26
00:01:31,909 --> 00:01:36,079
that he or she will be able to control
remotely so

27
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:39,590
to take a step back and ask why

28
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:43,020
the stakes are higher is because at the
physical implications

29
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:47,200
it is not a stretch to say that at some
point

30
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:52,799
in on an average home that if you have a
Windows machine for example

31
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:57,079
take a look at XP for example that at
some point you'll probably have

32
00:01:57,079 --> 00:02:00,189
malware I'm not when I say you are not
talking about

33
00:02:00,189 --> 00:02:05,320
the up sophistication in this room I'm
talking about the average consumer

34
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:09,830
and the implications of man where at
home

35
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:15,230
has been pretty high isbn: abuse to
steal financial information are social

36
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:17,150
private information online

37
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:21,890
on and things like that which are bad
implication in the first place

38
00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:25,300
but when I O T devices coming into the
mix

39
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:29,599
a malware that is within your internal
network at home

40
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:33,260
being able to turn a light up me now
we're talking

41
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:37,690
an intrusion into our physical space and
I think it's an important discussion to

42
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:38,640
start having today

43
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:42,250
the other thing to keep in mind is that

44
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:46,310
there are existing IT devices there a
consumer-grade

45
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:49,480
out in the market today and as we look
into the future

46
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:54,120
the technology to secure security
architecture the surrounding these

47
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:54,790
devices

48
00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:59,870
we'll progress into the future shell my
take on that and S is that in order to

49
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:03,830
contribute to have a good discussion on
how we get into the future securely

50
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:07,340
I mean we can have to be decomposition
all we want weekend

51
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:11,590
will probably agree to say that we need
authentication authorization access

52
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:13,790
control could keep tellin things like
that

53
00:03:13,790 --> 00:03:17,099
I feel to really have a discussion that
is meaningful

54
00:03:17,099 --> 00:03:20,110
we need to take a look at currently
available

55
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:25,909
IRT devices that are popular and lest go
deep in debt down and figure out what

56
00:03:25,909 --> 00:03:28,480
are the issues from an implementation
perspective

57
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:32,799
that we need to speak talking about to
that we don't commit the same mistakes

58
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:33,470
at bball

59
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:38,690
future devices that take us on to the
next decade so in order to have

60
00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:43,400
that discussion ham gonna pick on four
devices before I RT devices

61
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:47,489
one is a Philips you personal lighting
system so you could go to the Apple

62
00:03:47,489 --> 00:03:48,280
store today

63
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:53,430
on an are online and buy these light
bulbs that you can replace

64
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:57,560
ya right the LED Bob said you can go up
replace sorry about the apartment

65
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:02,110
are you home area of this web which then
allows you to from your iPhone or from a

66
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:02,790
website

67
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:05,970
remotely be able to control lighting in
your home

68
00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:09,129
by office so take a look at the
architecture

69
00:04:09,129 --> 00:04:12,519
has been used by Phillips and what can
go wrong what has gone wrong

70
00:04:12,519 --> 00:04:16,799
similarly will pick on the balcony we
mow baby monitor

71
00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:21,199
in this situation when I looked into it
it's not a one ability then I found the

72
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:23,330
way I did in the healing system

73
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:27,320
it was a bleeding security design
decision

74
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:31,070
that I think put Donna the owners have
not doctors

75
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:34,810
baby mine to address can we'll talk
about that similarly will take on the

76
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:36,990
balcony we must switch which is

77
00:04:36,990 --> 00:04:40,710
basically a a switch you put any outlet
and then any device to connect

78
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:44,280
into you can turn on or off remotely on
the Internet

79
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:48,100
and the Belkin net cam which is
basically a life I

80
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:51,150
HD camera you can install in your home

81
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:54,669
any can monitor remotely on

82
00:04:54,669 --> 00:04:58,979
I have done this talk are two or three
times before last couple months

83
00:04:58,979 --> 00:05:02,270
am happy to announce that is kind of a
last minute thing but I have a bonus

84
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:03,190
product

85
00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:06,610
that will do a cursory look at which is
Dion

86
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:09,820
Tesla Model S P 85 I'm

87
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:13,090
actually take this car up two weeks ago
n

88
00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:16,139
scrambling last minute to get some other
stop it right

89
00:05:16,139 --> 00:05:20,199
came to Singapore now I just wanna share
with you some other issues

90
00:05:20,199 --> 00:05:23,669
surrounding this car as well

91
00:05:23,669 --> 00:05:26,500
tell let's start with the lighting
system this is actually a photo of my

92
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:27,580
living room

93
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:30,940
as you can see it's not just controlling
the lights going on and off you can

94
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:31,919
actually said

95
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:35,050
the last 2 1/2 mmm thing six million
colors

96
00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:38,580
the iPhone app it's awesome you can
package a pagar PNG

97
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:42,460
and if we have 15 bob's at home you can
drop all these pins to

98
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:47,500
particular areas up to day Peggy a pic
and the like will change into that color

99
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:51,020
and I said depending on your mood EA can
kinda play around with and have a lot of

100
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:51,910
fun with it

101
00:05:51,910 --> 00:05:54,910
and also just not just having fun to see
utility of

102
00:05:54,910 --> 00:05:58,280
being able to turn on RRP could be in
your bed and say all lights off in my

103
00:05:58,280 --> 00:05:59,050
apartment

104
00:05:59,050 --> 00:06:03,650
once when should really understand the
the advantage of having such devices

105
00:06:03,650 --> 00:06:06,850
serbia was really hard to go back
actually a wonderful product

106
00:06:06,850 --> 00:06:10,270
and select less deep dig deeper

107
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:13,509
so if you buy the starter pack it comes
with the bridge

108
00:06:13,509 --> 00:06:17,250
the bridge deck sucks up to Yarra router

109
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:20,550
I using an ethernet cable and then the
bridge speaks

110
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:23,850
their ZigBee protocol to the box bite

111
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:26,460
and see the starter pack comes with the
bridge in three bothered you can keep

112
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:28,120
first extending

113
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:31,500
more bob's I think there is some sort of
a limit because this is consume a great

114
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:34,090
I think classics Dr Sam emailed at a
time

115
00:06:34,090 --> 00:06:37,889
to every bridge and then on the other
hand you have an iPhone app

116
00:06:37,889 --> 00:06:42,250
I think there's an Android app as well
but I don't care about and write as much

117
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:45,770
I'm so there's an eyelash apple just
stick to that

118
00:06:45,770 --> 00:06:50,539
and the IRS happen can control your bob
so if your local

119
00:06:50,539 --> 00:06:54,960
but within your local network at home it
connects directly to the bridge

120
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:58,160
if your remote it goes to the Philips
cloud infrastructure and we'll talk

121
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:01,690
about that

122
00:07:01,690 --> 00:07:04,970
so now sue me about the starter pack

123
00:07:04,970 --> 00:07:08,780
looked at the bridge you have lights and
you launch the

124
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:12,280
Hewat on your iPhone for the first time

125
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:16,419
the first thing the Europe I US Apple do
is say

126
00:07:16,419 --> 00:07:20,539
in now senior at home in the local
network ill try to find the bridge

127
00:07:20,539 --> 00:07:24,490
the bridge it has an internal IP address
and had an outbound connection to the

128
00:07:24,490 --> 00:07:25,160
Philips

129
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:30,120
on infrastructure so what your iPhone
need to do is figure out the IP address

130
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:32,860
on the bridge and the bridge is running
a lightweight

131
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:37,860
web server but in order to figure out
what the IP address as it actually hits

132
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:38,690
the

133
00:07:38,690 --> 00:07:43,880
this external URL me to dot com slash
API slash and UPnP

134
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:46,259
so what's happening here at the moment
you connect your bridge it gets you

135
00:07:46,259 --> 00:07:47,879
beast DHCP

136
00:07:47,879 --> 00:07:52,020
it connection do now bound to heal them
says your natural number his main

137
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:53,129
channel I P address

138
00:07:53,129 --> 00:07:56,550
and here's my Mac Address to anybody
from within your home

139
00:07:56,550 --> 00:08:00,639
who is this URL will get that
information so that's what the iPhone

140
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:03,849
app users to figure out where Charlie
the Badgers

141
00:08:03,849 --> 00:08:07,050
and of course for all the web app
security experts in here

142
00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:10,660
external website all sad access control
allow origin to star

143
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:14,720
which basically means any website in the
world can now you have the bridge

144
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:17,849
hugh system install and the mac address
and all that

145
00:08:17,849 --> 00:08:23,060
which is not a great thing in itself but
damn just enough why

146
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:26,069
so once your iPhone taylor's I'll

147
00:08:26,069 --> 00:08:29,860
where the bridge over local IP address
it connects to the bridge and I'll show

148
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:31,990
you the pusher class your phone will
send

149
00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:36,260
locally to the bridge but the moment
that Portugal SSN

150
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:40,409
you'll see this image in the iPhone ap
there's a button on the bridge that you

151
00:08:40,409 --> 00:08:41,459
need to press

152
00:08:41,459 --> 00:08:45,070
within 30 seconds this is basically the
security McCann is in here is that

153
00:08:45,070 --> 00:08:46,370
you're proving

154
00:08:46,370 --> 00:08:49,990
physical ownership up the bridge and

155
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:53,610
if you press the button within 30
seconds your iPhone is now authorized to

156
00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:56,220
issue a local commenced a bit

157
00:08:56,220 --> 00:09:00,740
so here's the Pasha quest at the bridge
sense to the bridge

158
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:05,050
now though your iPhone centerbridge and
basically it contains a user name which

159
00:09:05,050 --> 00:09:06,709
I deleted in this case

160
00:09:06,709 --> 00:09:09,720
and the username is basically a session
token that your

161
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:13,490
iPhone ap pics it could be anything

162
00:09:13,490 --> 00:09:16,800
am and then the user

163
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:20,399
precious the button on the bridge when
thirty seconds

164
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:23,510
the bridge responds with an OK and says

165
00:09:23,510 --> 00:09:26,970
from now on the username you just gave
me is a session token and is valid for

166
00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:28,430
ever

167
00:09:28,430 --> 00:09:32,990
I'm 10 things I realized as I was kinda
man limiting

168
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:37,750
man in the middling this stuff is that
for my particular iPhone no matter how

169
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:40,600
many times I reinstall I less from
scratch

170
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:44,180
that they teach session token the iPhone
was picking was the same thing same

171
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:45,850
every time

172
00:09:45,850 --> 00:09:48,990
and the session token look like an md5
hash

173
00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:53,640
for gesture but just based on a guess I
to the mac address at my phone

174
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:57,550
could computer the md5 hash of it and I
was the

175
00:09:57,550 --> 00:10:01,290
talkin that my phone much picking every
time

176
00:10:01,290 --> 00:10:05,190
and from a local perspective you can see
why this is a really big problem

177
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:10,950
now keep your eye on the future so 2020
you have 50 devices within your house

178
00:10:10,950 --> 00:10:15,130
do you really want your thermostat to
control the light bulb so there's an

179
00:10:15,130 --> 00:10:15,850
hour

180
00:10:15,850 --> 00:10:19,680
so that you have the whole idea after
wallace within the local network is out

181
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,329
the door if you're going to have to

182
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:24,519
3042 i sat at home in the future

183
00:10:24,519 --> 00:10:28,730
I'm to demonstrate this issue assume one
of your

184
00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:33,360
my nose workstations gets owned what
could a potential

185
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:37,880
next-generation now where do to exploit
something like this

186
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:41,930
to let just talk about this you blackout
bash script

187
00:10:41,930 --> 00:10:45,470
share what I do is a connector that
external URL assume this is a malware

188
00:10:45,470 --> 00:10:46,500
scripts

189
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:49,850
and that's running on a machine has been
owned connects I don't see that there's

190
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:50,880
a hue

191
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:55,940
on bridge and if the answer is no
actually two 10-minute rise again

192
00:10:55,940 --> 00:11:00,029
and when the answer is yes it basically

193
00:11:00,029 --> 00:11:04,050
does an art nache to see what Mac
addresses are flying in the air

194
00:11:04,050 --> 00:11:08,779
I remember if you already on the network
and the mac Address is playing in the ER

195
00:11:08,779 --> 00:11:12,529
public information takes teacher the mac
address as

196
00:11:12,529 --> 00:11:15,899
computes the md5 hash connects to the
bridge

197
00:11:15,899 --> 00:11:21,450
issues are likes of command that's the
trash true treasure slash action

198
00:11:21,450 --> 00:11:25,010
and the moment that a successful it goes
into an infinite loop in just a light

199
00:11:25,010 --> 00:11:26,600
soft light up lights off

200
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:30,589
initially for half a second to give the
bridge some time to recover

201
00:11:30,589 --> 00:11:37,589
am so let's see what this looks like an
action

202
00:11:38,390 --> 00:11:42,690
I'm on my website also have leon an
extensive paper that talks about a

203
00:11:42,690 --> 00:11:45,370
little bit more in detail that I'm able
to cover

204
00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:48,570
as if you really wanna figure out by the
architecture the system

205
00:11:48,570 --> 00:11:52,290
is like Bill be read that paper so now
what you'll see is a victim browsing

206
00:11:52,290 --> 00:11:56,490
to next on this website and the lamp
goes up

207
00:11:56,490 --> 00:12:00,110
threat and so now let's look at a
slow-motion

208
00:12:00,110 --> 00:12:04,139
the perspective the attacker I in this
case the attackers manually

209
00:12:04,139 --> 00:12:08,220
going through the Metasploit session we
can automate this but this is just here

210
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:08,810
to that

211
00:12:08,810 --> 00:12:13,180
we can now look at it step by step I'm
in this case is a Java

212
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:17,940
exploit that has been issued the victim
is wonderful

213
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:23,170
and and and attacker upload the script I
just talked about

214
00:12:23,170 --> 00:12:30,170
and basically launch it

215
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:39,290
now descriptor the successful

216
00:12:39,290 --> 00:12:43,900
the electoral have a blackout I'm there
is a split solution to this

217
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:48,680
Mexican temporary cessation

218
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:52,210
when in this case the victim is your
lighting a candle and then

219
00:12:52,210 --> 00:12:55,500
he realizes when a second my gadget
still work

220
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:59,530
and my neighbor still have electricity
there's something really wrong here and

221
00:12:59,530 --> 00:13:01,170
so what you can manually alright as

222
00:13:01,170 --> 00:13:04,670
Tony umbilicals which often on you Tasha
override

223
00:13:04,670 --> 00:13:08,390
tragic get the light bulb on but
remember them the mouth a scrip had and

224
00:13:08,390 --> 00:13:11,000
get an infinite loop so the lights come
back on for a few seconds

225
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,060
anyhow blackout again it just keeps
repeatedly

226
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:18,390
and going on you are still getting a
maneater of my apartment by the way

227
00:13:18,390 --> 00:13:22,740
so what you can do is

228
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:25,790
unplug the bridge in which case the

229
00:13:25,790 --> 00:13:29,080
you could manually override it and you
get the lights back on

230
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:35,930
but now

231
00:13:35,930 --> 00:13:42,930
you but the bridge back n much I guess
what happened

232
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:47,450
and if you are a power user you can go
to that

233
00:13:47,450 --> 00:13:51,139
API debugger on the web on the bridge
and I'm register your device

234
00:13:51,139 --> 00:13:54,399
and if you can do that

235
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:57,630
they're safe again but guess what your
iPhone doesn't work anymore

236
00:13:57,630 --> 00:14:02,310
and the Bruin descriptive text that and
it goes back into the ark cable looks at

237
00:14:02,310 --> 00:14:05,420
tried again the moment you take the same
iPhone

238
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:11,490
and retry associating it with the bridge
nice go back

239
00:14:11,490 --> 00:14:14,570
am see

240
00:14:14,570 --> 00:14:18,220
get my point that's one issue

241
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:23,019
and I talked till I tried contacting
Phillips three times

242
00:14:23,019 --> 00:14:26,810
the only way to contact them with
through the Twitter a direct message

243
00:14:26,810 --> 00:14:27,360
them

244
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:30,899
and they said during with indirect
message like

245
00:14:30,899 --> 00:14:36,680
just give us information national 140
characters really tough and

246
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:39,990
they said it's okay just just keep going
and I said no I'm not gonna

247
00:14:39,990 --> 00:14:44,610
tradition in to enter am in about two
months are trying that

248
00:14:44,610 --> 00:14:48,890
and in the stuff got public actually had
a great discussion with the

249
00:14:48,890 --> 00:14:53,510
main IT executive about this and since
then they have fixed the issue

250
00:14:53,510 --> 00:15:00,500
come to did other things to talk about
erect you don't need the Iowa sappy you

251
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:01,000
can

252
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,310
just go to the meet you dot com website
put in your

253
00:15:04,310 --> 00:15:07,910
username and password the pastor to
climb in 66 characters

254
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:11,079
your password can be one two three four
five six in it works

255
00:15:11,079 --> 00:15:15,199
does shaving razors that there's a
one-minute lockout but you feel it I'm

256
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:15,899
so that's good

257
00:15:15,899 --> 00:15:19,430
the question to ask is that in some
sense

258
00:15:19,430 --> 00:15:23,709
companies like Phillips now are becoming
Prime it

259
00:15:23,709 --> 00:15:27,240
owners are critical infrastructure right
I'm

260
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:30,120
where you could have a sustained like
%uh there's nothing to do with the great

261
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:30,709
itself

262
00:15:30,709 --> 00:15:35,220
and so as we start to come on take a
look at the implications are

263
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:38,510
lights going off in apartment

264
00:15:38,510 --> 00:15:42,430
or a high-rise condo in the only thing
we're using to protect

265
00:15:42,430 --> 00:15:48,370
that is a six character password and
then we had issues where people

266
00:15:48,370 --> 00:15:51,620
have a tendency to reuse passwords we
have

267
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:56,220
password leaks thousands a password
leaks almost on a

268
00:15:56,220 --> 00:16:00,040
hourly basis where other shoppers
compromised and all you have to do is

269
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:00,380
kinda

270
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:03,699
look at does usernames and password I
have been compromised from other web

271
00:16:03,699 --> 00:16:04,540
applications

272
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:07,740
and just try if it works on develops and
if it does

273
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:11,180
now you have ownership to that so I
think

274
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:14,319
on it my point here is that we really
need to be thinking through

275
00:16:14,319 --> 00:16:17,990
when it comes to it. just a blending
into our physical space

276
00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:22,230
on we can be protecting these things
like we had protect ourselves in the

277
00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:22,779
past

278
00:16:22,779 --> 00:16:27,800
a six character password year think that
things are in this is not just for hear

279
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:28,459
them

280
00:16:28,459 --> 00:16:32,850
is that in order for all these different
I A T devices to start to work and do

281
00:16:32,850 --> 00:16:33,819
the things we won

282
00:16:33,819 --> 00:16:38,050
we want them to interact with each other
and there's projects like if this than

283
00:16:38,050 --> 00:16:38,569
that

284
00:16:38,569 --> 00:16:43,180
it's a wonderful project where but you
can do it I F TTT is go to website

285
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:47,730
sign up and then you can using a lot I
heart raise your Gmail

286
00:16:47,730 --> 00:16:52,920
Australia Facebook killing 10 your hugh
system and can connect all these things

287
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:53,560
21

288
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:58,300
one dashboard and you can say things
like if my grandmother emails me

289
00:16:58,300 --> 00:17:01,390
make my a battle might scoff

290
00:17:01,390 --> 00:17:05,189
I don't know why you would do something
like that but you could I am

291
00:17:05,189 --> 00:17:08,270
and people could probably come up with
more useful examples like that you can

292
00:17:08,270 --> 00:17:09,189
kinda see where

293
00:17:09,189 --> 00:17:13,549
you have one platform that kinda
blending in the physical social and

294
00:17:13,549 --> 00:17:14,640
online spaces

295
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:19,630
in the concept I if this then that is to
build recipes to make all these things

296
00:17:19,630 --> 00:17:23,669
top together I think you really think we
need to be careful about this because

297
00:17:23,669 --> 00:17:27,620
here's an example of a recipe he said
when I'm tagged in a photo on Facebook

298
00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:31,540
chain my cue to reflect it colors well
what if I tag you in a black photo

299
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:34,640
are the lights go off again I'm

300
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:37,890
so there'd I'm not sure how analog

301
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:41,390
good how you could decide it one recipe
is more

302
00:17:41,390 --> 00:17:45,419
harmful than the other but I think we
have to be careful about that the other

303
00:17:45,419 --> 00:17:47,049
thing we have to ask ourselves as

304
00:17:47,049 --> 00:17:51,299
if I F TTT the platform where you have

305
00:17:51,299 --> 00:17:56,140
authorize I FTT your I have TTT account
to have access to your Gmail your

306
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:57,380
Facebook your

307
00:17:57,380 --> 00:18:01,040
cue your baby monitor in alls connect in
one place

308
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:05,610
then how do you how do you guard the
i've TDD infrastructure now because now

309
00:18:05,610 --> 00:18:06,909
is just as powerful hub

310
00:18:06,909 --> 00:18:10,440
that is connecting you let your space
for the a physical space

311
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:15,860
in israel's look at the other products
one other female you're gonna find me

312
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:20,450
repeat his dad if I'm a malware daughter
today

313
00:18:20,450 --> 00:18:23,620
what do I do I want to set up a botnet I
will

314
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:26,780
author my mouth where on train p.m.

315
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:30,530
and what role but does my mouth today do
in most cases

316
00:18:30,530 --> 00:18:33,760
angle on your machine using an ex played
or

317
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:37,720
can you double click on any XD and then
once my marriage install

318
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:41,899
I want to look at other computers that a
new network that I could in fact

319
00:18:41,899 --> 00:18:46,520
and connect back to the botnet while I'm
doing that all the machines are infected

320
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:51,040
I'm gonna keystroke logger everything I
can right I mean this is just a vanilla

321
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:54,169
now where the rear and you still out now

322
00:18:54,169 --> 00:18:58,300
but the future if I'm and now they're
Arthur not only am I gonna do all these

323
00:18:58,300 --> 00:18:58,990
things

324
00:18:58,990 --> 00:19:02,440
I'm gonna scan internally to see what

325
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:06,110
I O T devices you have for example the
signature for hugh would be

326
00:19:06,110 --> 00:19:09,809
connecting to external year old is the
database dead in the first place

327
00:19:09,809 --> 00:19:14,040
to my point in if you take on anything
this presentation is that

328
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:17,610
unless we start to talk about these
issues now and fix them

329
00:19:17,610 --> 00:19:21,200
we're gonna have exact same problem of
malware but in a new way where

330
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:23,899
it's not just gonna put on the
computer's browser physical devices

331
00:19:23,899 --> 00:19:27,809
within our homes

332
00:19:27,809 --> 00:19:32,950
am let's move on to the baby monitor

333
00:19:32,950 --> 00:19:37,440
to the baby monitor in this case is just
an audio device shows from Belkin

334
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:40,890
you connected to you your wifi

335
00:19:40,890 --> 00:19:44,649
a network locally and then you have the
iPhone app

336
00:19:44,649 --> 00:19:48,659
I believe there is no Android app for
this one just the iPhone

337
00:19:48,659 --> 00:19:51,909
and then the baby monitor and the

338
00:19:51,909 --> 00:19:55,860
iPhone app you step to connect they can
listen in to your baby

339
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:59,540
by the way the implication share is not

340
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:05,780
which urban self-proclaimed cute baby is
saying usually about

341
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:08,899
somebody invading your privacy to
overhear conversations using a device

342
00:20:08,899 --> 00:20:11,530
like this

343
00:20:11,530 --> 00:20:15,409
and before I could sell I don't have any
kids that I know of

344
00:20:15,409 --> 00:20:18,600
but I did purchase this device

345
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:22,630
to start to take a look at you know how
things work but be even before I was

346
00:20:22,630 --> 00:20:24,169
able to unpack the thing

347
00:20:24,169 --> 00:20:27,760
I read this review on Amazon by
non-technical

348
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:30,980
expecting parent he says them

349
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:35,030
it has very pure poor security model
that leaves to be more open to and

350
00:20:35,030 --> 00:20:36,620
welcome monitoring

351
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:40,750
that we know allows any I was device on
your local network to connect to it

352
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:44,909
and listening without a password if
that's not bad enough

353
00:20:44,909 --> 00:20:48,730
when an iPhone is connected once on the
local network it can tune in later

354
00:20:48,730 --> 00:20:54,720
to the monitor from anywhere in the
world this is by design right

355
00:20:54,720 --> 00:21:01,720
and let me prove that to you

356
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:05,770
again have a paper on this as well as
this which on my website is pretty

357
00:21:05,770 --> 00:21:06,820
lengthy see if you wanna

358
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:13,820
deep get into more details on what's
going on in the background feel free

359
00:21:20,850 --> 00:21:24,230
so I'm launching the email baby monitor
now I'm on the local network

360
00:21:24,230 --> 00:21:31,230
right it fine sir device

361
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:52,270
and then you can just click on listen

362
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:57,700
I love that and buff artists like your
mind you have a real player

363
00:21:57,700 --> 00:22:03,360
commitment

364
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:03,830
Erica

365
00:22:03,830 --> 00:22:07,649
in any listing is

366
00:22:07,649 --> 00:22:12,490
now will stop at will get out the app
and what I'm gonna do here is disable

367
00:22:12,490 --> 00:22:15,529
wifi so now we're connecting external
either for GLP

368
00:22:15,529 --> 00:22:18,620
you relaunch it

369
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:23,360
from anywhere in the world and you have
access to it so

370
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:26,529
I don't you think you're thinking while
issue a little I'm a creepy friend that

371
00:22:26,529 --> 00:22:27,549
she was up to my

372
00:22:27,549 --> 00:22:31,120
house and request for my wifi password
and then he or she can listen in tonight

373
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:31,860
about that

374
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:35,629
because we look at the underlying
architecture imagine again for another

375
00:22:35,629 --> 00:22:36,379
author

376
00:22:36,379 --> 00:22:40,480
what basically saying it would be a
one-time local access your in

377
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:44,350
I'm so

378
00:22:44,350 --> 00:22:47,679
the if you're going to write a script

379
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:51,470
and getting the internal network for a
couple a second what you do use UPnP

380
00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:55,169
the baby might respond as you get the
baby much as your number

381
00:22:55,169 --> 00:22:58,399
the IP address you basically connect to
this

382
00:22:58,399 --> 00:23:01,990
issue this push request to the web so
we're joining on the baby monitor

383
00:23:01,990 --> 00:23:06,120
Anna you pick a device ID you like and
then

384
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:10,090
UN ill respond back what's my private
key which is the sheer number of the

385
00:23:10,090 --> 00:23:10,809
baby monitor

386
00:23:10,809 --> 00:23:15,580
and once you have that you just connect
to this

387
00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:18,960
external IP address using a and a SIP
client

388
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:22,090
and you from address is

389
00:23:22,090 --> 00:23:26,610
the ID you just picked and the to
address is basically the

390
00:23:26,610 --> 00:23:30,509
shown the world to be minor and then
from now on forever

391
00:23:30,509 --> 00:23:35,570
you can listen in and so my concept here
again

392
00:23:35,570 --> 00:23:39,830
that if we're gonna have the baby
monitor if you're gonna have dick

393
00:23:39,830 --> 00:23:42,870
Phillips you like to system in your own
local network

394
00:23:42,870 --> 00:23:47,419
we can't really be trusting devices that
are on the same local network

395
00:23:47,419 --> 00:23:53,990
quickly go to two more products and
we'll go to the Tesla

396
00:23:53,990 --> 00:23:57,139
so similarly am

397
00:23:57,139 --> 00:24:02,370
Belkin makes the switch and exact same
thing it connects to wifi

398
00:24:02,370 --> 00:24:06,289
you have an iPhone app that you can
control from anywhere in the world

399
00:24:06,289 --> 00:24:11,080
I'm to turn to switch on or off
initially exact same protocol the baby

400
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:11,659
monitor

401
00:24:11,659 --> 00:24:16,480
if you're in if your local you can just
connect to the switch in safe of

402
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:20,129
on are on and there is no checks if your
local you're in

403
00:24:20,129 --> 00:24:23,200
and you can kinda stuck to see

404
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:26,619
how this could be exploited in this case
if you wanna writer

405
00:24:26,619 --> 00:24:29,619
annoying script that one such

406
00:24:29,619 --> 00:24:33,009
and I'll where to time the stretch of
every

407
00:24:33,009 --> 00:24:37,679
hapa second are five seconds business
going to

408
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:44,679
free four lines right and sell

409
00:24:59,090 --> 00:25:02,380
made and here's to years select Internet
later on

410
00:25:02,380 --> 00:25:08,030
does ask you try to turn it back on
story of

411
00:25:08,030 --> 00:25:13,160
yes I just in an infinite loop I'm

412
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:16,780
so here's that's a plan to keep trying
to make is that the whole

413
00:25:16,780 --> 00:25:20,750
we have accepted that in the enterprise
lightning bugs are bad idea

414
00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:25,400
in we haven't done much about that in
our homes but I think as we look into

415
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:27,520
the future we have all these devices

416
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:31,340
I think a lot of high-rise condos are
coming in built with some these devices

417
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:35,110
we don't have we would be hot to

418
00:25:35,110 --> 00:25:39,150
make sure that the lender understands as
we're consuming these devices

419
00:25:39,150 --> 00:25:43,390
that it is not OK to design delay says
that im explicitly trust each other even

420
00:25:43,390 --> 00:25:44,540
done the same network

421
00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:47,870
am

422
00:25:47,870 --> 00:25:52,010
another this was a really quick one this
is also by Belkin

423
00:25:52,010 --> 00:25:55,200
arm life I HD net camera

424
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:58,760
in fact this 1i was pretty convinced
that there's really not much to report

425
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:02,640
everything was as a child the camera
connects on bond for ssl/tls

426
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:06,150
the iPhone app connects outbound there's
no local trust

427
00:26:06,150 --> 00:26:09,800
strong password requirements pretty well
done

428
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:12,960
right and I want to write this one of

429
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:16,970
and delila just kinda sniffing my local
network and I saw this random you TP

430
00:26:16,970 --> 00:26:18,420
packet in clear fly by

431
00:26:18,420 --> 00:26:21,880
with my username and password I I still
haven't figured out

432
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:26,120
what this or as in why it's going there
and so all this

433
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:29,920
hard work on architecting there sweetie
lashes just out the door

434
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:33,610
to probably some sort of a debug code
dat

435
00:26:33,610 --> 00:26:36,610
was left in there I did contact Belkin

436
00:26:36,610 --> 00:26:39,620
customer support with this exact
screenshot in fact

437
00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:45,320
I had more details and I trust you guys
web data showed

438
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:49,810
the Belkin now support people and the
responses I got back was

439
00:26:49,810 --> 00:26:53,690
what is why a shock

440
00:26:53,690 --> 00:26:57,039
and sell they said well it's just never
the LASIK what is this number

441
00:26:57,039 --> 00:27:01,809
and so ice my responses reply to
Sherlock

442
00:27:01,809 --> 00:27:06,220
you know you need to figure out the
right person in your team

443
00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:10,070
because behind the right person ill make
sense to them I can't really help you

444
00:27:10,070 --> 00:27:10,610
with that

445
00:27:10,610 --> 00:27:17,610
I mean I haven't heard back since then
so

446
00:27:17,690 --> 00:27:20,929
am if someone way to invade we made me
think about it

447
00:27:20,929 --> 00:27:24,390
in the US for example I mean kinda night
but think we're here but

448
00:27:24,390 --> 00:27:27,820
Comcast 18 team in there major ISP
providers

449
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:33,370
on if somebody were just kinda sniff
this one particularly you TP traffic

450
00:27:33,370 --> 00:27:36,370
I can guarantee you there's tens of
thousands of these not cameras and your

451
00:27:36,370 --> 00:27:38,070
password is fine on unclear

452
00:27:38,070 --> 00:27:42,400
and you don't even know it that could
allow anybody remotely to be able to

453
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:45,630
I view you am

454
00:27:45,630 --> 00:27:49,130
and so this is really to be really need
to be taking

455
00:27:49,130 --> 00:27:54,660
this very seriously Tesla

456
00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:59,679
I'm a dick van Halen ask I think after
Steve Jobs passing

457
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:02,850
and this is one guy that I look up to
him his range variational

458
00:28:02,850 --> 00:28:06,190
I'm I purchased a test about two weeks
ago

459
00:28:06,190 --> 00:28:10,580
am and I love the car it is a fully
electric car

460
00:28:10,580 --> 00:28:14,980
and I just to give you some perspective

461
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:18,780
it is Dez did not a joke this is not

462
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:22,809
a toy car that you can just write up to
say as an electric car kits

463
00:28:22,809 --> 00:28:26,630
a lot of times to blass eletric baikal i
sat in with a golf cart

464
00:28:26,630 --> 00:28:30,850
right answer just to give us some
perspective this thing has for a sixteen

465
00:28:30,850 --> 00:28:34,150
horsepower it goes from 0 to 60 mouse in
4.2 seconds

466
00:28:34,150 --> 00:28:39,440
and this is truly the car the future and
I think moneyline is doing

467
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:43,390
is amazing their billing all the super
charging stations across

468
00:28:43,390 --> 00:28:48,059
freeways pp where they're selling
Tesla's and you get to charge a car

469
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:51,160
forty minutes 023 by 250 miles per hour

470
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:54,600
do pretty massive range in by fifty
45-50 minutes

471
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:58,470
and it's free for life maximizing solar
cell

472
00:28:58,470 --> 00:29:02,230
I think if you want to sustain life
solar is

473
00:29:02,230 --> 00:29:06,840
the me answer some big fan a Tesla and
then so I haven't had much of a chance

474
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:08,510
to be extremely intrusive

475
00:29:08,510 --> 00:29:12,179
with the technology but I did notice a
few things that I want to share with you

476
00:29:12,179 --> 00:29:15,570
till when you buy a am

477
00:29:15,570 --> 00:29:18,850
by the lake chris Christie dealer who do
know that it

478
00:29:18,850 --> 00:29:22,470
SEM government

479
00:29:22,470 --> 00:29:25,720
this it she is here governor

480
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:28,880
New Jersey whose kinda band the sale of

481
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:34,150
test lab because too painfully the
dealers lose out and I don't know how

482
00:29:34,150 --> 00:29:35,700
this is bad for the consumer

483
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:40,010
but so so if you were to buy a test like
you have to set up a test account

484
00:29:40,010 --> 00:29:43,340
and and you pick a password

485
00:29:43,340 --> 00:29:46,780
six characters the climate six
characters but has had one number and

486
00:29:46,780 --> 00:29:47,400
one letter

487
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:51,500
arm once you pick

488
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:54,990
battery order your car depending on
which model you get

489
00:29:54,990 --> 00:29:58,890
chose I between a month to three months
and then

490
00:29:58,890 --> 00:30:03,270
moment you pick it up within 24 hours
you download the Model S

491
00:30:03,270 --> 00:30:08,090
iPhone app you login with the same
credentials and you can control their as

492
00:30:08,090 --> 00:30:08,880
part of the car

493
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:12,160
now granted you will cannot as a the
design of the app

494
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:15,770
turn on the car by the way there's no
such thing as

495
00:30:15,770 --> 00:30:19,559
on the test last minute again with the
key fob it's in part you just gotta

496
00:30:19,559 --> 00:30:21,270
drive so there's no concept of on

497
00:30:21,270 --> 00:30:26,040
but the car one drive miss you have the
club but with this I'll asap you can

498
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:28,840
unlock the car and you can know where
the car is still is just

499
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:33,290
take a look at those two use cases in
sold

500
00:30:33,290 --> 00:30:37,300
Mike my point here is very simple we
cannot protect

501
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:41,270
our vehicles like we protect our
workstations

502
00:30:41,270 --> 00:30:45,290
so six character password no brute force
lemon

503
00:30:45,290 --> 00:30:48,960
you can brute force the Tesla website
with the particular email address

504
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:52,460
part long as you want in the moment you
and your in

505
00:30:52,460 --> 00:30:55,710
not only are you and you can see where
the car is gone yet in a market

506
00:30:55,710 --> 00:30:58,929
I'm so there's that one clear

507
00:30:58,929 --> 00:31:02,530
attack what they're there and phishing
attacks.

508
00:31:02,530 --> 00:31:06,830
I mean if you want a phishing attacks I
mean imagine

509
00:31:06,830 --> 00:31:11,320
setting up a domain Tesla Motors dot com
playing so the MHRA unanswered looks

510
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:12,050
like an M

511
00:31:12,050 --> 00:31:15,050
you things like that they're really
would be known to

512
00:31:15,050 --> 00:31:18,800
years and how to do and it imagine you
were to harvest

513
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:22,559
Anna see a ten thousand 5,000 test
accounts

514
00:31:22,559 --> 00:31:27,130
like that test also has addressed API
that the IRS that connects to dance not

515
00:31:27,130 --> 00:31:28,790
intended to third parties to assist

516
00:31:28,790 --> 00:31:33,679
poorly designed for the Tesla I less at
commissar a simple

517
00:31:33,679 --> 00:31:38,990
PPI bed basin on a GET request did kinda
see I could automate this if your lunch

518
00:31:38,990 --> 00:31:40,840
a phishing attack against st. urges

519
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:44,669
when she had the user name password you
basically am

520
00:31:44,669 --> 00:31:49,179
point your domain to port poor old ugly
and attention where the calm

521
00:31:49,179 --> 00:31:52,760
do gonna summit log in with the
credentials have captured

522
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:56,800
if you get a session token back UN and
Ashish in talking is a valid for three

523
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:58,169
months

524
00:31:58,169 --> 00:32:01,260
when she had a session token you should
get requested wiggles

525
00:32:01,260 --> 00:32:04,560
you're looking for the vehicle ID which
had not given

526
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:08,840
once you have the ID you can am

527
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:12,520
issue commands drive state which he
returned a lot of things about the

528
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:13,500
vehicle

529
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:17,630
including the light light Lee the
longitude and latitude

530
00:32:17,630 --> 00:32:20,669
and now you can have this table for all
these cars are

531
00:32:20,669 --> 00:32:24,750
other great show that you fished pick a
card that you're still going you're at

532
00:32:24,750 --> 00:32:26,040
and then

533
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:30,250
issue a GET request to a cause I D
commander unlock

534
00:32:30,250 --> 00:32:34,710
on is so I mean these israeli basic
stuff here

535
00:32:34,710 --> 00:32:37,919
I'm our taxi can kinda see if I were to
right now there

536
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:41,350
and that infected your workstation I
wanna keystroke logger every time you

537
00:32:41,350 --> 00:32:42,919
log into the test let down

538
00:32:42,919 --> 00:32:46,440
and also the website when you log in I
think the session token is valid for a

539
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:47,970
long time she just gilder

540
00:32:47,970 --> 00:32:53,550
cookie I mean we've talked about that
concept a password leaks imagine

541
00:32:53,550 --> 00:32:56,970
I could guarantee you that morning
sixties any person a Tesla owners

542
00:32:56,970 --> 00:33:03,400
their password effect they reeled in
other applications

543
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:06,630
there's also the solution in urine test
le support

544
00:33:06,630 --> 00:33:10,480
I'm I L Apple has had that problem
recently where people were shot in

545
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:14,950
engineering the Apple customer support
and resetting people likely account

546
00:33:14,950 --> 00:33:18,870
and in this case our forum posting read
it to you

547
00:33:18,870 --> 00:33:23,270
I just a reminder if you're this is the
test owner on the Tesla Forum website

548
00:33:23,270 --> 00:33:26,490
just a reminder if your key fob is in
your bag

549
00:33:26,490 --> 00:33:29,960
and you're able to walk up to a door
including the rear hatch in a lot

550
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:33,159
Lola ok able to keep you get locked out

551
00:33:33,159 --> 00:33:36,730
fortunately test a test like in remote
unlock your door and I called the

552
00:33:36,730 --> 00:33:37,300
support

553
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:41,960
number in Freddie I believe it was
helping out in was fantastic

554
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:45,200
coming back a few times to make sure
everything was cool stuff dispersion

555
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:45,919
call cat

556
00:33:45,919 --> 00:33:51,120
Tessler customer support and a nice guy
called Freddy I'm not his car for him

557
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:53,950
on which is great because all the
Freddies I'm known I just such nice

558
00:33:53,950 --> 00:33:55,080
people right

559
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:59,980
I'm but this concerns me made i mean I'd
last time I call to support

560
00:33:59,980 --> 00:34:06,710
they wanted the last 6 of my then which
is on my windshield

561
00:34:06,710 --> 00:34:09,790
the other information I think Tesla has
about me is my driver license

562
00:34:09,790 --> 00:34:11,929
information to that on my profile

563
00:34:11,929 --> 00:34:16,010
some given to bury some benefit of the
doubt maybe pretty did verify that

564
00:34:16,010 --> 00:34:16,580
information

565
00:34:16,580 --> 00:34:20,980
me but I don't think it's enough it's
not clear

566
00:34:20,980 --> 00:34:25,679
because the last time I went to a car
dealer anti-gun

567
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:30,179
a a drip been drove around the car they
took a photocopy my driver license rape

568
00:34:30,179 --> 00:34:30,580
so

569
00:34:30,580 --> 00:34:34,470
other people how that information it's
really not clear what's going on it's

570
00:34:34,470 --> 00:34:35,980
not clear to me as

571
00:34:35,980 --> 00:34:41,280
eighty owner which employees have access
to this information

572
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:44,839
which employees can't see you in my car
is where I am driving and be told on

573
00:34:44,839 --> 00:34:45,669
market

574
00:34:45,669 --> 00:34:50,190
market I don't get me wrong I think the
the usability the functionality

575
00:34:50,190 --> 00:34:53,740
when I'm in need of help is fantastic

576
00:34:53,740 --> 00:34:57,660
I'm not saying the test I should do away
from the service

577
00:34:57,660 --> 00:35:01,670
it did they have fantastic customer
support they're able to monitor your car

578
00:35:01,670 --> 00:35:05,619
in there something wrong with the call
you proactively and ten people are so

579
00:35:05,619 --> 00:35:08,640
they done a good job but I think we will
need to be careful

580
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:11,680
about the power disinterested within
their local I

581
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:16,670
employees

582
00:35:16,670 --> 00:35:19,869
so if your test owner one other thing
that I highly recommend is

583
00:35:19,869 --> 00:35:24,530
if you have a Tesla profile set up a
brand new gmail account is exclusively

584
00:35:24,530 --> 00:35:26,290
use for this purpose

585
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:33,190
enable to factor on in assertion that
with your test account

586
00:35:33,190 --> 00:35:37,210
and the other issue is that I think
he'll on moscow has publicly stated that

587
00:35:37,210 --> 00:35:38,589
they are diligently

588
00:35:38,589 --> 00:35:43,300
working on an SDK I'm assuming that SDK
will become a national libraries

589
00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:48,040
combination of a sandbox or some sort an
API

590
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:51,550
and the reading process in a lil ways at
the Apple Store does

591
00:35:51,550 --> 00:35:55,810
to be able to allow short naps to run i
text only and with and the test time I

592
00:35:55,810 --> 00:35:57,040
meant

593
00:35:57,040 --> 00:36:01,440
and Tesla has said publicly that the
REST API that they have exposed today

594
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:06,780
is not meant to put third parties to
invoke but people are doing anyway

595
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:11,310
grade am in this case is a Google last
test lab

596
00:36:11,310 --> 00:36:16,200
so if you want to monitor your at your
apt car from low-class you basically

597
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:17,930
install the glass ap

598
00:36:17,930 --> 00:36:21,680
then you go to National Glass qdo naps
but that com

599
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:24,839
and you actually type in your cash my
credentials

600
00:36:24,839 --> 00:36:29,940
and it goes to a random third-party that
party in turn connects to the API

601
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:34,240
so the problem here is that I know test
lies doing the right thing by

602
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:37,930
trying to perfect the st. can women they
eventually put out

603
00:36:37,930 --> 00:36:42,890
but in that mean time we have a lot of
people that are you using these random

604
00:36:42,890 --> 00:36:45,750
third-party application done on dented
by Tesla

605
00:36:45,750 --> 00:36:49,350
and giving up the credentials to
third-party

606
00:36:49,350 --> 00:36:52,550
are so this is something to really watch
out for in this is not just to poke at

607
00:36:52,550 --> 00:36:53,450
Tesla

608
00:36:53,450 --> 00:36:56,810
I can imagine there's another car there
are also control control a bill in this

609
00:36:56,810 --> 00:36:57,370
way

610
00:36:57,370 --> 00:37:03,330
that we should be asking this question
these questions about

611
00:37:03,330 --> 00:37:06,930
the other and in this amount more fun

612
00:37:06,930 --> 00:37:10,589
now been maybe a medium risk

613
00:37:10,589 --> 00:37:13,910
issue is that if you

614
00:37:13,910 --> 00:37:16,970
lend me a key fob is

615
00:37:16,970 --> 00:37:21,020
difficult for me to clone you keep up if
I return your key file back to you

616
00:37:21,020 --> 00:37:25,180
and you trust me with that I think
you're you pretty much safe

617
00:37:25,180 --> 00:37:29,230
arm issue is a lot more complex decline
and I don't have the expertise but

618
00:37:29,230 --> 00:37:33,670
people have heard I'm sure there are
people had expertise but it's Anish

619
00:37:33,670 --> 00:37:36,810
up to field

620
00:37:36,810 --> 00:37:40,440
however if you if I have temporary
access to your I found

621
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:44,050
the session token that stared at stored
on the iPhone is valid for three months

622
00:37:44,050 --> 00:37:46,390
since the last London

623
00:37:46,390 --> 00:37:49,580
so you know this is the concept of the

624
00:37:49,580 --> 00:37:53,290
your iPhone I mean I think there's an
Android app as well

625
00:37:53,290 --> 00:37:56,390
be trusted for three months at a time

626
00:37:56,390 --> 00:37:59,810
you know if someone were to have
temporary access to in our backups

627
00:37:59,810 --> 00:38:02,890
where that engine token is toward Tom

628
00:38:02,890 --> 00:38:06,480
is probably not the greatest thing

629
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:09,620
I would imagine in the near future if

630
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:13,680
I Nile SAT for example if Apple where to
allow all

631
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:17,490
third party app still averaged a touch
ID functionality

632
00:38:17,490 --> 00:38:20,480
die would be something that it doesn't
know where to build built and I'm not

633
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:21,920
the car I also have do

634
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:25,390
had my fingerprint and in addition to
having ownership but the phone

635
00:38:25,390 --> 00:38:30,760
I think that would be a much much better
and safer way of doing this

636
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:33,960
and the other than part that I have not

637
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:37,140
personally tested but I've gotten this
information from elsewhere

638
00:38:37,140 --> 00:38:40,530
from a4a is that there's actually a
weird eaten at jack

639
00:38:40,530 --> 00:38:44,859
on the left of the dashboard you connect
your laptop to lead

640
00:38:44,859 --> 00:38:48,230
and you see the three IP address is
running SSH NFS

641
00:38:48,230 --> 00:38:51,380
X 11 HTTP domain

642
00:38:51,380 --> 00:38:55,420
RBC behind I'm

643
00:38:55,420 --> 00:38:59,069
and if your dad put your if you were to
put on by shocking just kinda look at

644
00:38:59,069 --> 00:39:00,190
the

645
00:39:00,190 --> 00:39:04,010
traffic that's flying by I it's a lot of

646
00:39:04,010 --> 00:39:07,420
overwhelming you TP traffic blah to
censor information now

647
00:39:07,420 --> 00:39:11,580
like I said I was able to capture some
other traffic bad I'm happy I'm had time

648
00:39:11,580 --> 00:39:12,720
to park said

649
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:16,920
but if you have and protests are lying
around I have friends i mean this would

650
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:17,420
be

651
00:39:17,420 --> 00:39:22,060
I think there's a lotta low hanging
fruit here I am a little bit has a stand

652
00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:23,870
to be intrusive with this

653
00:39:23,870 --> 00:39:27,600
and less if somebody else's vehicle and
because

654
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:31,420
men especially NFS mount I think that is
more in this case disc read-only with

655
00:39:31,420 --> 00:39:33,710
navigation information

656
00:39:33,710 --> 00:39:37,960
but I mean I would imagine there are
things you could be doing that could

657
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:39,380
potentially affect the car

658
00:39:39,380 --> 00:39:44,400
and if you where to I wonder that would
be under warranty

659
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:50,300
has not so far low-hanging fruit sure
that I think we should watch

660
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:53,980
am by the way simple are the things that
I talked about

661
00:39:53,980 --> 00:39:57,600
they're not gonna believe disperse am
just calling out some design decisions

662
00:39:57,600 --> 00:40:02,150
I they're not intentional one abilities
however if you were to find Tesla

663
00:40:02,150 --> 00:40:05,790
an actual under the lead in Tesla that
is unintentional contest last part they

664
00:40:05,790 --> 00:40:07,040
have an awesome

665
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:10,859
make an ISM weight can be reported so
and

666
00:40:10,859 --> 00:40:14,069
thumbs up for that and i actually some
other all the stuff that I've talked

667
00:40:14,069 --> 00:40:15,520
about I have communicated

668
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:18,560
to Tesla and we have an ongoing threat
about that

669
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:23,900
so they're really great at at our
talking donors about this

670
00:40:23,900 --> 00:40:27,930
that how you might enjoy to disagree she
look and you know that the takeaway from

671
00:40:27,930 --> 00:40:28,819
this is

672
00:40:28,819 --> 00:40:33,710
and we start looking to the future me
things like cars dead are so powerful

673
00:40:33,710 --> 00:40:37,120
me you really cannot be protecting these
things the way we have

674
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:42,370
try to protect our workstations and
failed and owners need to be cognisant

675
00:40:42,370 --> 00:40:46,290
about the rest of putting that they're
leaving on the table

676
00:40:46,290 --> 00:40:50,470
and I have fooled I will you have fooled

677
00:40:50,470 --> 00:40:55,560
faith given the nature earth all the
Tesla people that have interacted with

678
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:59,069
the lines personality that the entire
nation stages

679
00:40:59,069 --> 00:41:02,580
but I think in the near future they'll
be more transparent about exactly how

680
00:41:02,580 --> 00:41:03,520
the underlying

681
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:07,319
check 2002 then we feel comfortable
about it am

682
00:41:07,319 --> 00:41:10,859
that's all I had pushed today I

683
00:41:10,859 --> 00:41:17,859
can take questions if you want

684
00:41:20,980 --> 00:41:27,980
terminated

685
00:41:29,550 --> 00:41:35,789
me

686
00:41:35,789 --> 00:41:38,750
right RBIs this a test so does

687
00:41:38,750 --> 00:41:42,200
for the map information in real time
maps

688
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:47,019
so if you want a satellite traffic it
had it had an always-on 3G connection

689
00:41:47,019 --> 00:41:51,490
that's outbound and I think it uses
Google Maps for that now at the moment

690
00:41:51,490 --> 00:41:53,210
you just don't have 3G

691
00:41:53,210 --> 00:41:57,150
it kinda uses the local information the
compass an ex-army does to know

692
00:41:57,150 --> 00:42:00,210
to guide you but you want how up-to-date
detailed maps

693
00:42:00,210 --> 00:42:04,900
you away I did not come through 3G for
sure

694
00:42:04,900 --> 00:42:09,500
the test also I weighed in color is it
it can also hop onto wifi

695
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:13,960
when available for a few when you're
back home in a garage you can log onto

696
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:14,630
wifi

697
00:42:14,630 --> 00:42:18,950
interest if that what you'll see is open
bpm being used to connect back to test

698
00:42:18,950 --> 00:42:20,079
which is a great thing

699
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:23,519
however what that tells me they're just
did a shared secret somewhere

700
00:42:23,519 --> 00:42:26,569
either choosing certificate so there's a
static

701
00:42:26,569 --> 00:42:30,039
Hannah shared secret am

702
00:42:30,039 --> 00:42:37,039
so that will be interesting to test to
alright well

703
00:42:37,329 --> 00:42:40,839
I'm hang around here for next couple
minutes come say hi thanks
