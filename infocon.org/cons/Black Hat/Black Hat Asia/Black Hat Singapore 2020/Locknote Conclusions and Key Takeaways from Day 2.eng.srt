70
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:12,239
absolutely and hi i'm mika devonshire

71
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:14,239
i'm a digital forensics and incident

72
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:14,879
response

73
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:17,760
specialist at black panda which is an

74
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:18,879
exclusive

75
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:20,560
incident response digital forensics

76
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,640
company in hong kong and singapore

77
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:25,760
um i've been investigating cyber crimes

78
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:26,080
and

79
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,959
very busy this year so i guess we'll

80
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:33,040
have a lot to talk about

81
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,360
a double-edged sword right it's like oh

82
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,879
i've got a lot of great stories

83
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:41,920
a lot of bad stuff happens exactly

84
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,760
so i guess we could start with the topic

85
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,040
of bad stuff

86
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,519
if you all want to go around i know

87
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:50,080
security's been very busy lately it's

88
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,000
great to have black hat at this time of

89
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,360
year um

90
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,599
to sort of wrap up and see how we've

91
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:56,480
done

92
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:59,760
through q3 and what is it going to look

93
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:00,000
like

94
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,040
moving forward sure

95
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,360
um i think i can comment on that first i

96
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,439
think uh what was interesting was

97
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:09,360
when everything started happening with

98
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,519
the pandemic and

99
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:13,599
um going into different quarantines and

100
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:15,760
stuff like that

101
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:18,000
everybody was like oh well you know

102
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,519
we're going home and we're going to work

103
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:20,639
from home and you're going to have all

104
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:22,320
this like free time to work on this

105
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:22,800
project

106
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:26,240
that you needed to get done

107
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:29,120
unless you worked in cyber security in

108
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,639
which case

109
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:33,520
man uh have we been busy right there's

110
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,680
been some interesting challenges with

111
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:39,040
uh expanding our you know environments

112
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:39,840
outside

113
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:42,639
of our you know traditional sphere or

114
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:42,960
just

115
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:45,600
the scale of the expansion was an

116
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,600
interesting challenge as well where

117
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,280
um you know you were seeing companies

118
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:51,919
sending employees home and being like

119
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:53,520
well we need you to work

120
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,919
but we haven't sourced you a laptop yet

121
00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:57,120
we don't have a corporate

122
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:00,960
device as far as a phone for you yet um

123
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:03,360
we are working on multi-factor

124
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,960
authentication

125
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:07,199
we're working on increasing our vpn

126
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:09,280
licenses like there were all of these

127
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,039
like what we would consider like

128
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:12,720
foundational things

129
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:15,840
that became incredible challenges when

130
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:18,320
when the the issue of scale you know

131
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,520
came about and so

132
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,280
i i feel like just for the first couple

133
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,800
of months it was just like

134
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,039
go go go go go make sure we're just like

135
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:27,039
shoring up defenses as quickly as we

136
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:27,600
could

137
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,600
and in some cases um seeing a lot of

138
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,440
organizations doing things

139
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:34,880
that in a um you know in a normal

140
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:38,080
environment or situation we would never

141
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,639
ever do right so that's that's been an

142
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:42,080
interesting challenge i don't know

143
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:44,160
um what all of your experiences have

144
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:53,840
been with that but it's been interesting

145
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:57,199
i can chime in on the unusual

146
00:05:57,199 --> 00:05:58,240
occurrences

147
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:01,360
um so it's tough because no

148
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,520
security teams had time to really train

149
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:06,639
up their end users or

150
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:08,479
you know mass roll out security

151
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:11,120
awareness training best practices

152
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,479
you know each of us could jump on

153
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:14,560
webinars and give some tips like

154
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:17,520
updating your your firmware for all your

155
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:18,400
devices

156
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,479
as asuka i'm sure you probably deal with

157
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:22,160
that a lot people just not updating

158
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,360
their firmware

159
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:27,120
um but even things like how to use rdp

160
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:30,160
or how to use the internet so

161
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,000
unfortunately one of my cases

162
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,880
um started as an employee who had gone

163
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,720
home the company hadn't yet

164
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,720
put two-factor authentication on their

165
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,639
vpn services

166
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:42,960
and the employee actually plugged his

167
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:45,199
laptop in with an ethernet cord to

168
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:48,479
the modem directly exposing

169
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:50,240
everything to the internet including his

170
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,840
rdp uh

171
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:54,240
which was brute forced the attacker got

172
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:54,960
in through

173
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:58,560
rdp saw that he had a vpn session open

174
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:01,680
pried around and within 10 hours

175
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,360
had pivoted into the network and

176
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:06,000
encrypted about 80 out of 100 systems

177
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,880
with ransomware

178
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,319
mimikatz on the domain credential i mean

179
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:17,039
it was ugly

180
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:20,240
okay so this few months like i saw a lot

181
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:20,560
of

182
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,560
like fishing attempts that are tied to

183
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,400
kobe 19

184
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:27,039
and also like i see like attacker

185
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:28,080
started to target

186
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,400
the platforms that are heavily used in

187
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:31,280
the

188
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:33,840
um the remote works such as like doom

189
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:34,880
and webex

190
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:38,319
and etc and also as

191
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:41,240
mika said like like cooper network

192
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:42,639
infrastructures are

193
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:45,919
like protected by the company's

194
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:50,240
uh engineer but the the home routers

195
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:53,360
are not as secure as a corporate

196
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,240
infrastructure

197
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,879
so because it is managed by the

198
00:07:56,879 --> 00:07:57,759
individual the

199
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:00,800
employees so i think this

200
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,280
would be really good attack vector for

201
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:06,479
for the attackers yeah

202
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:11,039
yes in case of career you think that

203
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:14,639
the most big problem is that we can use

204
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:15,039
a

205
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:18,319
physical security like before it

206
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:21,599
means that physical security such as

207
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:25,120
preventing usb and uh the preventing

208
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:28,479
mobile phones camera cannot be realized

209
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:32,400
in the company so uh

210
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:36,159
our our secure team of career

211
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:39,440
now was talking about how to we improve

212
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:43,200
the physical security at home

213
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:46,480
so and and also uh in in his

214
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:49,440
career in korea even young students need

215
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,720
to use

216
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:54,160
distance learning systems but

217
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:57,200
but the the the keys

218
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:00,640
cannot use uh well the security

219
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,000
configurations

220
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,000
of the notebook and so on so

221
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,720
nowadays we think about the uh the

222
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:09,600
importance of

223
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:12,880
the usable security for the keys and and

224
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:16,160
and uh and housewives and so on

225
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:17,839
yeah it's interesting like you like you

226
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:19,519
mentioned just even the physical

227
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:20,959
security aspect of it

228
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:25,360
um but like i mean i was hearing stories

229
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,000
again from

230
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,760
from organizations of all different

231
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,279
sizes like this wasn't just something

232
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:29,839
where

233
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:32,240
um small businesses or mom and pop type

234
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,120
of shops were

235
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,560
trying to struggle with this this was

236
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,560
like large multinational corporations

237
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:37,839
who were like

238
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:40,320
um i guess just pack up your machine and

239
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,600
take it to your house

240
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,920
you know and like we talk about data

241
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,760
loss prevention and then you're like

242
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,600
take your entire machine and just take

243
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,360
it with you um

244
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,600
so from a physical security standpoint

245
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,360
you know we were literally just handing

246
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,240
employees

247
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,959
everything and just saying like take

248
00:09:56,959 --> 00:09:58,800
this to your house and hook it to your

249
00:09:58,800 --> 00:09:59,600
internet

250
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,760
and then hopefully like you can just

251
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:05,200
keep on working um

252
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,519
you mentioned as well like the increase

253
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:08,320
in fishing

254
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:11,120
campaigns that were specifically around

255
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,560
you know the virus

256
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:15,600
and i i mean i i

257
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,760
for as part of my personal like you know

258
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:18,880
threat intelligence

259
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:22,000
like uh time that i spend i bump around

260
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:22,720
on you know

261
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,560
the dark net and dark markets and stuff

262
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:25,760
like that

263
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:28,399
and you you can see there were a lot of

264
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:30,800
a large uptick in the scam guides that

265
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,640
were specific to the virus saying

266
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,560
like here's how you want to craft an

267
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,720
email like preying on the fear

268
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,760
that people had um or doing things like

269
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:40,160
saying

270
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,640
oh we understand that you're you know

271
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,640
like like employees basically

272
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:47,040
don't don't know how things are working

273
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,000
right now

274
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,160
so using that confusion to get them to

275
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,680
click on things or install things they

276
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:56,160
wouldn't do like oh here's the new

277
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:59,600
you know platform for for everybody

278
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,279
getting together on a video chat

279
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:03,839
run this executable and people were just

280
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:04,480
doing it

281
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:08,240
and so uh like some of the

282
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,320
um some of the other like huge things

283
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,399
was like the uptick in business email

284
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:14,240
compromise now again because everybody's

285
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,680
like working from home and trying to do

286
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:16,560
this stuff

287
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:19,839
you had like how do we work with

288
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:21,920
financial stuff how do we pay

289
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:24,160
bills and who's handling what and how

290
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:25,680
are we doing that without our normal

291
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:26,640
systems

292
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,880
and so those fishing campaigns were

293
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,240
leading to

294
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,079
you know hundreds of thousands or

295
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:33,760
millions of dollars being

296
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:36,720
just you know wired off to you know the

297
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:37,600
wrong account

298
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:40,640
and you know at the cost of you know ten

299
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,959
dollars for some scam guide on a dark

300
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:43,519
market

301
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:45,040
you know they're turning around and

302
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,399
turning that into a business email

303
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:49,360
compromise campaign that's returning

304
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:52,720
an absurd amount of money

305
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:56,959
do you think that next year

306
00:11:56,959 --> 00:12:00,480
the the papers related with the remote

307
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:04,399
work security increased in blackout

308
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:07,440
uh will will we see more um more

309
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,560
submissions around

310
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:10,639
it i think we already have kind of right

311
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:12,720
um we just finished up

312
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:15,760
the selections for the europe

313
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:18,560
um show and there were there were quite

314
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,000
a few that are related to

315
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,240
you know securing remote workers and

316
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,760
remote environments and you're like man

317
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:24,000
like

318
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,120
researchers were on it like that so

319
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,399
it'll be interesting to see how it

320
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:31,360
continues to develop

321
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:38,240
with with bec definitely a huge uptick

322
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:40,800
taking advantage of of that remote work

323
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:41,760
and

324
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:44,639
you know if the company doesn't have mfa

325
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:46,480
there's really not much you can do

326
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:49,519
but turn to the admin and say

327
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:51,760
why didn't you have this up yet the

328
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,440
other challenge is that a lot of the

329
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,959
white listing policies

330
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:58,000
only work to prevent remote access you

331
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:58,320
know

332
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:01,279
in a normal situation um so when

333
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:02,240
employees

334
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:05,519
you know use a personal vpn or they

335
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:07,920
go home and they're using an unknown ip

336
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,519
address

337
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:11,760
even just the the high rate of it

338
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,279
support tickets

339
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:15,360
is pushing down the importance or the

340
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:18,160
ability for users who actually have

341
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:20,240
you know a live scam on their device

342
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,839
from being heard

343
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:24,000
so if they're still being you know

344
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
connected and i've seen a lot of mail

345
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:26,639
forwarding

346
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:29,839
is is typically a um a tactic so even if

347
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:32,160
the user changes their password

348
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:34,959
if if uh your admins don't check all the

349
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:36,399
forwarding rules or the mailbox

350
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:37,519
delegation

351
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:40,720
or your dmarc dkm aren't set properly

352
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,639
you know you can just continue that data

353
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:45,040
loss for i've seen up to three weeks

354
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,399
they didn't catch the

355
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:49,519
forwarding rules so again it's you have

356
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:50,079
to check

357
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:52,800
every box really really truly in this

358
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:53,680
environment

359
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:55,120
and what's crazy about that is like

360
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:57,279
these like i don't know i mean

361
00:13:57,279 --> 00:13:59,279
we we just sat through two days of

362
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:01,440
incredible research where it's

363
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:05,199
um you know the the amount of

364
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:08,240
of know-how to accomplish some of the

365
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:10,320
attacks that we were just learning about

366
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,079
it's like oh you have to take this

367
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:14,000
machine and dip it in liquid nitrogen

368
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,440
while you're on a boat somewhere along

369
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:16,079
the equator

370
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:17,920
like there's all this crazy stuff but

371
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:20,480
right now we're talking about like

372
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:22,560
the most fundamental and foundational

373
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:23,760
things like

374
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,920
were what were causing companies like

375
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,519
full outages or just even like

376
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:28,399
disruption

377
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:30,399
i mean we're on zoom right now right and

378
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:32,560
like the like zoom bashing and jumping

379
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:33,360
in and

380
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,600
and just disrupting people's meetings

381
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:36,399
and just

382
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:38,399
having a good time i guess clowning

383
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:39,600
around um

384
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:42,399
was really disruptive for people and so

385
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:42,800
like

386
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:45,040
again you know super foundational things

387
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:46,480
that um

388
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:49,600
we kind of uh i guess had to

389
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:52,079
keep start focusing back on that rather

390
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:52,639
than

391
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:55,760
again like these these super complex uh

392
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,360
oh day style things like you're not

393
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,800
gonna burn something like that or put

394
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,160
that much effort in

395
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:01,760
when somebody plugs their laptop

396
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:05,600
straight into their home router right so

397
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:17,120
well i guess um i don't know i guess

398
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,639
i'll ask a question and there was no

399
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:19,600
questions in the chat

400
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:22,399
hey people watching this put questions

401
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:23,040
in there

402
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:26,399
give us topics to talk about um i will

403
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:27,360
ask um

404
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:31,040
i guess like what is something outside

405
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:31,920
of you know

406
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,600
outside of the the elephant in the room

407
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,360
that is covet 19 like what are

408
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,680
what are struggles or things that you

409
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:39,199
guys are working with now or trying to

410
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:40,000
get a handle

411
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,800
around that you think we'll be working

412
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,399
on for the foreseeable future

413
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:46,000
or hopefully finding solutions for

414
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,959
sometime in the future

415
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:52,160
what's your big project or what's that

416
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,519
thing that sticks in the back of your

417
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:56,880
head that maybe keeps you up at night

418
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:00,399
okay so i can talk a bit so as i said

419
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:01,680
earlier i'm now

420
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:04,000
mainly researching about the iot

421
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,040
security

422
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:08,720
especially on consumer algae devices

423
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:11,920
and during the research i sometimes like

424
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:12,480
analyze

425
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:15,759
iot firmware but it's quite

426
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:18,880
vulnerable and for example the binary

427
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,079
files are in

428
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:22,560
that are included in the framework are

429
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:23,839
not that secure

430
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:27,199
for instance the uh common vulnerability

431
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:28,560
mitigation technology

432
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:31,519
such as like pi stack canary and fortify

433
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:32,720
source

434
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:36,160
are frequently not enabled and

435
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:38,560
also the version of third-party

436
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:39,680
libraries

437
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:43,440
is often quite old really really old

438
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:47,199
and also uh the path release cycle for

439
00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:50,399
ld devices are also like not

440
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:54,560
as good as the like desktop application

441
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:56,959
like in my past research research i

442
00:16:56,959 --> 00:16:58,560
conducted like last year

443
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:01,440
i found that a lot of like new type of

444
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,040
uh one day exploitation

445
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:07,359
risk for the iot devices

446
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:10,559
and so now i'm thinking that

447
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:13,760
like like this is also like covered in

448
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:16,480
yesterday's keynote but i think one way

449
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:17,679
to solve this

450
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:21,280
kind of problem is to explicitly

451
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:24,319
write oh write the list that's a

452
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:25,199
software law

453
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:28,319
the software bill of materials

454
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:30,880
and the security patch distribution

455
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:31,600
cycle

456
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:34,320
for the debate of the devices as a level

457
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:34,720
uh

458
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:38,320
like a nutritional model so

459
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:42,000
yeah but it is also yeah it is also

460
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,160
talking the yesterday's keynote so maybe

461
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:44,559
all

462
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:47,840
already oh everyone already knows

463
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:50,559
but yeah this is my current perspective

464
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:53,120
for the iot security field

465
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:54,480
well i think the fact that if it was

466
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,400
brought up in the keynote yesterday and

467
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,080
you're bringing it up now

468
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:00,240
maybe we should care so don't take it as

469
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:02,080
like oh i'm repeating something i've

470
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:03,360
said in the keynote

471
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:05,919
um if it's something that's of concern

472
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:07,039
to you as well then

473
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:08,720
then obviously you know it's of

474
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:11,280
importance

475
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:15,360
i i think that in in covet

476
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:19,280
19 er is it possible to do all the works

477
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:22,320
at home to do that

478
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:25,919
we i think that for doing that

479
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:28,400
we need more detailed data

480
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:31,039
classification rules and and so on so

481
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:36,000
by doing this we can use a more

482
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,240
more granulized access control system

483
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:39,280
and so on

484
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:42,640
but but i think that muslim

485
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:45,520
company or the muslim uh school doesn't

486
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:45,919
have

487
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:49,080
that kind of detailed rules for the data

488
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:50,640
classifications

489
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:54,720
so uh i think that uh in nowadays

490
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:58,080
security guys don't think about that uh

491
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:01,760
nowadays security guys uh likes uh more

492
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:04,799
technical one and so on so but uh

493
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:07,440
i think that in in coming 19 years we

494
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:08,480
should

495
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:11,039
return to the basic and we should think

496
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:11,520
about

497
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:14,480
think again the basic rules about

498
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:15,440
security of

499
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:19,200
our home and our company and so on

500
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:22,880
i agree with that 100 i mean um

501
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:24,400
our investigations are only as good as

502
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,840
the data that we're getting and the way

503
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:26,480
that we're

504
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:28,559
you know carving that data up i actually

505
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:30,320
i realized when i introduced myself was

506
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:31,520
just like i'm borrow the review board

507
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:33,039
like i'm a principal threat hunter for

508
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:34,160
rsa

509
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:37,440
um by day so i spend all day carving up

510
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,039
you know super large data sets and

511
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:41,760
trying to find the little anomaly in it

512
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:43,039
that makes you

513
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:46,480
pause and go what's that um but without

514
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:49,679
without clean well-organized data to

515
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:51,600
to move through um it's it's an

516
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,039
impossible job

517
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:54,880
um i guess well depending on who you

518
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:56,400
talk to like if you talk to

519
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,320
a lot of vendors out on an expo floor

520
00:19:58,320 --> 00:19:59,520
somewhere they'll tell you that their

521
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:01,600
machine learning or ai

522
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:04,880
will do that for you i assure you

523
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:07,039
um all of their if then statements they

524
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:09,200
call machine learning um are not

525
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:12,240
you know really uh you know

526
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:15,120
up to snuff at this point but um but

527
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,640
yeah i agree with that hundred percent

528
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:17,200
like

529
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:19,600
some again i i don't we talk about this

530
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:20,960
stuff all the time it's a lot of this is

531
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:21,280
like

532
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:23,200
foundational basic block and tackle

533
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,960
security that we've been

534
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,720
um you know where some of the first

535
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:28,159
things we all learned when we started

536
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:30,000
doing this right so

537
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,080
um keep it simple

538
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:35,600
nothing more frustrating for an

539
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,200
investigation than

540
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,720
when the client just doesn't have the

541
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,480
data you need

542
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:41,919
to perform the investigation it's a

543
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:43,840
chicken and egg situation

544
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:45,840
um and unfortunately you know if you

545
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:47,760
haven't already set up logging

546
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,919
or you don't you don't keep the hard

547
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:52,000
drives or images

548
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,799
after an incident it's really hard to

549
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:55,600
you know

550
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,760
hire someone and have them tell you what

551
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:00,240
happened who did it am i still infected

552
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:02,320
without that full full picture of the

553
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:03,360
data set

554
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:05,120
so you asked you know what what's a

555
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:06,480
project that we're

556
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:09,120
working on keeps us up at night uh my

557
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:10,400
team is trying to

558
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:14,080
create a fully remote cyber war room

559
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:15,919
and figure out what is the fastest most

560
00:21:15,919 --> 00:21:17,200
efficient way

561
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:20,320
to get client data to spin up instances

562
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,080
we need for analysis

563
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:24,559
have sandboxes ready for for malware

564
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:25,840
analysis

565
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:27,919
because either we can't get to the

566
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:28,880
client site

567
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:32,000
or they'll hand us this data and there's

568
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,080
five of us working on it spread across

569
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:37,120
multiple continents um you know it's

570
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:38,559
it's not the way it used to be you don't

571
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:40,240
have well typically

572
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:41,919
a lot of these scenarios are in the

573
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:43,440
cloud but

574
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:45,039
you know you don't have a go bag and you

575
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:47,039
can't go greet someone

576
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:49,520
um right you're used to like showing up

577
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:51,200
on site ordering a bunch of pizza

578
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:54,320
and like getting to work right yeah so

579
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:57,280
um yeah i i'm with you on that i think

580
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:59,360
that um

581
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:01,360
that's that's i think it's one of the

582
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:03,280
biggest frustrations i guess somebody

583
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:04,880
who's like you know an instant response

584
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:06,159
is that you're

585
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:08,080
um when you show up and you don't have

586
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:09,919
that data and then it's like okay well

587
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:11,760
now we have to go around like trying to

588
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:13,840
deploy things or do things after the

589
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:14,640
fact

590
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:17,120
um when i talk to folks normally about

591
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:18,480
like what they should have like in a

592
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:20,000
sock like standing

593
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,360
up a sock and things like that because

594
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:23,039
of my experience like running out for

595
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:24,640
black hat people often say like what are

596
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:24,960
the

597
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,480
technologies that i should have or do

598
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:28,559
whatever and again you know basic block

599
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:29,200
and tackle

600
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:31,039
i'm like i'm like log everything like

601
00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:32,320
literally log

602
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:33,840
everything if you have a device that

603
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:35,360
creates a log

604
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:37,120
just write it to disk somewhere i don't

605
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:38,559
like you don't even have to put it

606
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:40,880
in a sim if you don't have that

607
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,799
technology or it's too expensive to keep

608
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:44,320
dumping the stuff in there

609
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:46,320
i'm like even if they never look at it

610
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:47,679
but please

611
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:50,240
you know please look at your logs like

612
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:50,880
have them

613
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,960
because when the ir team comes in if

614
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,720
there's a breach and you can turn around

615
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,400
and be like well we have a bunch of logs

616
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:57,679
we've never looked at them

617
00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:00,799
but we have them in a much better

618
00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:02,240
situation than

619
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:03,919
trying to run around collecting things

620
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:05,679
after the fact it's just

621
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:08,400
um i said storage is cheap dump it to

622
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,159
disk come on give me something to work

623
00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:11,760
with

624
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:14,480
well and with amazon or or azure you

625
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:16,159
just click a couple buttons

626
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:17,840
and then all of a sudden your your data

627
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:20,880
is stored for cheap

628
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:23,760
right around the corner that's what

629
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:24,080
let's

630
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:26,720
uh put out a little uh like a tweet or

631
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:27,840
something that's like

632
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,600
this is the button this is what you

633
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:30,960
check

634
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:33,200
please for your incident responders

635
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:37,679
check this box

636
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:41,600
we have a question in the chat yes it is

637
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,360
have you all seen a difference in the

638
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:45,520
types of incidents or breaches over the

639
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:46,240
past six

640
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:49,279
months mikko what do you think of that

641
00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:51,120
one

642
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:54,960
um so i'd say similar to what

643
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:58,080
everyone was talking about you know the

644
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:00,720
the key ingredients are the same so it's

645
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:02,720
rdp brute force

646
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:06,720
um mimikats credential lateral movement

647
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:10,320
ransomware or um backdoor

648
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:13,600
data x fill wait a little bit

649
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:17,120
get caught try to come back in bec

650
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:19,039
all looks pretty normal it's just the

651
00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:21,120
way that the recipe is prepared is a bit

652
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:21,760
different

653
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:25,919
so um bec a lot of it will will focus on

654
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:28,000
that fear you were talking about

655
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:28,370
um

656
00:24:28,370 --> 00:24:31,360
[Music]

657
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:34,400
unprecedented things like you know not

658
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:36,159
protecting your wireless connection at

659
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:36,559
home

660
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:39,200
or if you are traveling you know not

661
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:41,120
realizing how much data could be exposed

662
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:42,480
while you're traveling

663
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:46,640
um sangju mentioned physical security so

664
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:49,360
taking usbs and and things and not

665
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:51,360
encrypting data

666
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:52,960
all of those things have have changed

667
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:54,480
the landscape but

668
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:57,600
in general you know

669
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,840
these attacks still have the same core

670
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:00,960
components

671
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:03,360
um but the the rate at which we're

672
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:05,200
seeing them has just

673
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:07,919
gone through the roof

674
00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:11,279
i hope that answers anyone else that's

675
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:15,840
good anybody else

676
00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:19,919
all right i mean i will say um

677
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:23,200
man ransomware's having a good time huh

678
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:26,720
like my gosh some of the ransomware

679
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,559
attacks in the last six months

680
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:31,840
um i mean you're talking half million

681
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:34,559
million dollar like payoffs and then

682
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:36,400
like some of them like negotiations are

683
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:37,440
things for

684
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:40,080
i'm gonna i'm gonna blank on on which um

685
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:40,960
which company

686
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:44,000
was that was just recently um hit up for

687
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:44,559
i think was

688
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:46,799
was it 24 million i want to say it was

689
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:48,080
24 million

690
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:50,320
and they didn't pay so they were like oh

691
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:52,559
well now you're gonna give us 40 million

692
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:56,080
and it's like 40 million dollars

693
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:58,880
like um i've seen some interesting stuff

694
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:00,480
even in like uh

695
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:03,360
the back and forth negotiations between

696
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:04,400
um

697
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,320
like when the ransomware attack occurs

698
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:07,520
and normally you get the you know the

699
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:09,360
scary pop-up that gives you the skull

700
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:10,159
that's harder

701
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:13,039
you know we're gonna do whatever but um

702
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:14,159
but the shift

703
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:16,799
from it just being that your files are

704
00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:18,159
locked up to

705
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:23,840
um you know what am i trying to say here

706
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:26,159
extortion where you know like saying

707
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:27,279
like being like okay

708
00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:29,200
not only do we lock your files up but we

709
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:31,360
also exfiltrated a bunch of data

710
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:34,000
so now even if you did the right thing

711
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,520
and you did the backups and you did all

712
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:37,360
that type of stuff

713
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:39,600
if you don't pay us we're gonna just

714
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,120
dump it on the internet

715
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:43,679
and so the shift from straight up like

716
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:45,679
locking up your files to

717
00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:48,159
now not only locking them up but also

718
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:49,279
exfiltrating them

719
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:52,080
and then dumping them online is leading

720
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:52,640
to some

721
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:55,600
really really large ransomware payouts

722
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:56,480
and so

723
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:58,400
i think that has been really interesting

724
00:26:58,400 --> 00:26:59,679
to watch over the last

725
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:02,159
you know six months to a year yeah

726
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:02,720
without

727
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:04,960
mentioning the client um some of that

728
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,080
can also be

729
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:08,640
attributed to when's the last time you

730
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:09,919
all rotated your

731
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:14,000
aws credentials uh is there a static key

732
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,919
coded in any of your github repos um

733
00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:21,840
you know are yes they're scouring

734
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:24,720
the internet right now just looking for

735
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,559
stuff that they can use

736
00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:29,679
and in some cases it results in you know

737
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:33,520
access to the aws configuration

738
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:35,120
then they can change security group

739
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:36,799
permissions they can spin up

740
00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:40,559
an individual server uh they can dump

741
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:41,039
out

742
00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:43,360
data from another database and then move

743
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:45,840
it out over a port that they set up just

744
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:48,720
straight to the outside um so that that

745
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:49,840
sort of

746
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:53,360
again it sounds pretty basic but

747
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:54,960
i think security teams are just so

748
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:56,640
overwhelmed with how much else they have

749
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:57,679
going on

750
00:27:57,679 --> 00:28:00,080
it's hard to say go back to basics and

751
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:02,880
start over again

752
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:07,360
so much data yeah in case of uh asia

753
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:10,559
voice fishing as well as landscape is

754
00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:13,600
also a problem big problem in in

755
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:16,880
in our case the nowadays many people

756
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:20,320
use the sms messages

757
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:23,600
and and other type of internet messages

758
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:26,559
such as ordering and eating food and so

759
00:28:26,559 --> 00:28:28,320
on so

760
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:32,399
nowadays uh most of uh criminals

761
00:28:32,399 --> 00:28:35,600
uh use uh user

762
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:38,960
voice fishing to steal the money and so

763
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:41,200
on

764
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:44,799
in our case the 10 times increased

765
00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:48,080
compared with the eight years before

766
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:51,520
wow um

767
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:53,679
we have another question that says have

768
00:28:53,679 --> 00:28:55,520
you seen many

769
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:58,080
incident response cases where forensics

770
00:28:58,080 --> 00:28:59,360
on iot

771
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:01,679
or embedded devices must be done to

772
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:04,480
identify the attacker's entry point

773
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:08,559
i think asuka that's probably a question

774
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:13,919
so i mainly research

775
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:16,720
about like how to um discover the

776
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:18,559
vulnerability so

777
00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:21,679
for the incidence response case i think

778
00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:24,880
mika have more experience than me

779
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:28,320
so could i pass the question to her no

780
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:31,439
yeah of course you can yeah

781
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:36,399
well hopefully you know if you have the

782
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:37,679
right data and you're

783
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:41,360
you're able to trace root cause

784
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:44,640
because again in ransomware a lot of

785
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:46,880
a lot of the files on the file system

786
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:47,760
are gone but

787
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:50,000
all of the artifacts that are core to

788
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,840
the operation of the file system are

789
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:52,880
still there

790
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:55,520
so say you find an indicator that points

791
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:57,279
to an ip address that brings you to an

792
00:29:57,279 --> 00:29:57,840
iot

793
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:01,200
embedded device um i haven't seen much

794
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:02,240
of that

795
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:05,120
except for maybe

796
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:08,080
in the financial services industries you

797
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:09,440
know

798
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:12,000
some atms and some payment networks

799
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
still have to run on legacy operating

800
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,039
systems

801
00:30:15,039 --> 00:30:17,919
so it's a bit tangential but you know

802
00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:19,919
those exploits do happen

803
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:22,720
where it's not the asset you would think

804
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,480
was compromised but that lateral

805
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:25,520
movement

806
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:28,720
um allows them to sort of bypass the

807
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:30,399
security you thought you had in place

808
00:30:30,399 --> 00:30:33,440
on one device um i guess it's a

809
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:35,520
half-baked answer

810
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:38,000
but no it's not i think that's that's a

811
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,520
that's a fair answer i think

812
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:42,320
too it's like at least in my experience

813
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:42,799
uh

814
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:45,200
you know again from from like an ir

815
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:46,000
standpoint like

816
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,240
seeing iot devices being used as like

817
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:50,559
jump boxes like just as the

818
00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:53,919
like the question was you know um

819
00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:56,240
like looking at the forensics on iot or

820
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:57,279
embedded devices

821
00:30:57,279 --> 00:30:59,519
to identify the attacker's entry point

822
00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:00,480
and

823
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:02,960
in a lot of cases i've seen the iot

824
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:03,840
device is the

825
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:06,799
entry point like it's like that's like

826
00:31:06,799 --> 00:31:07,360
an isn't

827
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:10,640
so um it's interesting you know to

828
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:12,159
to think about it that way it's like oh

829
00:31:12,159 --> 00:31:14,559
look it's this you know

830
00:31:14,559 --> 00:31:17,120
iot security camera or whatever which is

831
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:19,519
ironic that the security camera is the

832
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:20,240
thing that

833
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:22,559
allows an attacker into the environment

834
00:31:22,559 --> 00:31:23,279
um

835
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:25,600
and then normally is a staging point for

836
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:26,720
something like a

837
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,399
ransomware attack or something like that

838
00:31:28,399 --> 00:31:30,480
so

839
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:33,120
i think the quick takeaways don't share

840
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:34,159
credentials

841
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:37,279
individual credentials per device uh

842
00:31:37,279 --> 00:31:40,640
segmentation uh

843
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:42,559
asuka would tell you all about patching

844
00:31:42,559 --> 00:31:44,320
firmware right

845
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:47,919
right if you can yeah on some of them

846
00:31:47,919 --> 00:31:50,000
it's not even an option and that's

847
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,399
that's what's frustrating as well yeah

848
00:31:52,399 --> 00:31:53,760
vendor doesn't like

849
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:56,960
um distribute a patch yeah

850
00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:00,159
yeah is that getting better asuka like

851
00:32:00,159 --> 00:32:02,240
is that like what's the

852
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:05,360
what's the shift there like as in in iot

853
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:08,000
devices are is the are vendors getting

854
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,440
better at that

855
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:11,840
it's getting a little bit better but

856
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:13,519
there's still a lot of

857
00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:16,880
lots of pro problems like for example

858
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:20,080
like the research that i conducted last

859
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:20,480
year

860
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:23,200
i found like the vendor sometimes

861
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:24,000
doesn't like

862
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:28,720
release the patch for the uh so

863
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:31,120
iot devices have a lot of like series

864
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:32,240
like series a

865
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:35,679
series b two three c and three b

866
00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:39,200
and um so that kind of series

867
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:44,159
um usually um shares the same firmware

868
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:47,200
however um vendors like release

869
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:51,440
uh the patch for uh in different timing

870
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:54,799
for for a different series so

871
00:32:54,799 --> 00:32:57,600
um so that going to be like the one day

872
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:58,559
exploitation

873
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:01,600
risk and monday explosion um

874
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:04,720
the attacker can one day exploit

875
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:08,080
the different series using by the

876
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:11,279
using the patch release from the another

877
00:33:11,279 --> 00:33:15,679
uh like series a to series b

878
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:20,880
okay in the in the first day keynote

879
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:23,600
the speaker said that singapore uh

880
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:26,559
government has a plan

881
00:33:26,559 --> 00:33:30,480
uh for uh security rating on iot devices

882
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:31,039
i i

883
00:33:31,039 --> 00:33:35,039
i i hustle yeah i hope so

884
00:33:35,039 --> 00:33:37,200
that that's actually it's cool i think

885
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:38,480
that's um

886
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:42,000
it was a good keynote i enjoyed it

887
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
let's see we're getting more questions

888
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,760
yes

889
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:48,000
um let's see with the increase in

890
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
complexity and cyber threats and

891
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,559
end user knowledge gaps in cyber

892
00:33:52,559 --> 00:33:54,399
security what are the challenges

893
00:33:54,399 --> 00:33:57,760
face to train the user

894
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:00,640
oh that's a good one

895
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:07,840
who wants to take that

896
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:09,760
what are the challenges in training the

897
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:12,159
user

898
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:16,879
all right i'm just going to keep talking

899
00:34:16,879 --> 00:34:18,560
i just i feel like i'm rambling a lot

900
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:19,359
here

901
00:34:19,359 --> 00:34:21,359
but i think i mean i think this is kind

902
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:22,719
of getting a little bit better

903
00:34:22,719 --> 00:34:24,960
um at least better from where we were

904
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:25,918
years ago

905
00:34:25,918 --> 00:34:28,639
um the understanding of the general user

906
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:29,839
that security is

907
00:34:29,839 --> 00:34:32,480
important i guess is what is is the

908
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:34,239
first step right and i think we were

909
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:35,359
fighting that fight

910
00:34:35,359 --> 00:34:37,199
10 years ago where we're trying to get

911
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:38,399
people to do

912
00:34:38,399 --> 00:34:39,679
you know we're like security matters

913
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:41,599
security matters security matters

914
00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:43,520
and you just get that blank stare you

915
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:45,520
know where they're like maybe it matters

916
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:46,560
to you

917
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:49,520
um but i think more and more end users

918
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:51,040
are understanding

919
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:53,679
that they you know could potentially be

920
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:55,520
a weak link in that in the chain of

921
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:57,200
security within an organization and

922
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:57,599
could

923
00:34:57,599 --> 00:35:01,760
cause a multi-million dollar issue or

924
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:03,359
their company to end up on the news

925
00:35:03,359 --> 00:35:05,520
right and so it is a little bit scary it

926
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,760
creates a little bit of anxiety

927
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:10,640
but it also means that it creates a

928
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:12,560
sense of urgency to understand what the

929
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:13,760
problem is

930
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:16,800
um you know doing things like

931
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:18,079
you know and again i feel like we're

932
00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:20,079
just we keep going but foundations are

933
00:35:20,079 --> 00:35:21,280
important right we keep going back to

934
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:23,839
foundational stuff but even things like

935
00:35:23,839 --> 00:35:27,200
you know uh doing a

936
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:28,800
a fishing campaign against your own

937
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:30,720
users and having them understand that

938
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:32,320
like oh this is what

939
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:35,040
a phishing email is because again

940
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:35,920
despite

941
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:38,000
the incredible research that we see all

942
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,400
the time like most of the

943
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:43,280
um the initial attack vectors for a lot

944
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:44,400
of these you know

945
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:47,040
huge breaches or are done through a

946
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:48,720
simple phishing campaign or

947
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:50,800
through cracking an rdp session or

948
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:52,320
whatever and so

949
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:55,359
it's you know i think that has improved

950
00:35:55,359 --> 00:35:57,040
users have started to understand like

951
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:58,240
okay where

952
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:01,040
you know we're part of this security

953
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:02,480
thing and um

954
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:05,520
and it actually matters so

955
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:07,040
i don't know we've seen some improvement

956
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:08,560
we're not we're not there yet but we've

957
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:13,839
seen some improvement

958
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
i was just going to say where where

959
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,240
there is a rule or a regulation or a

960
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:23,200
requirement

961
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:26,640
to train users or implement

962
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:29,280
some sort of annual check or even where

963
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:29,920
the

964
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:32,079
i guess punishment for violations is

965
00:36:32,079 --> 00:36:33,119
severe

966
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:35,839
um i've heard of several banks and

967
00:36:35,839 --> 00:36:36,560
financial

968
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:39,040
services companies in hong kong that

969
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:41,920
have a one strike or two strike policy

970
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:44,160
if you click on one phishing email you

971
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,599
know you have to take three hours of

972
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:46,640
training

973
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:48,079
but if you click on one again you

974
00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:49,760
actually can be dismissed from the

975
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:51,119
company

976
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:55,440
yeah that's a beer that's that's crazy

977
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:58,560
but but but it is not easy to educate

978
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:02,240
the general people that

979
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:06,479
most of people still do not update their

980
00:37:06,839 --> 00:37:08,000
formulas

981
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,480
agree

982
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:14,240
um well i mean we're getting close to

983
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:16,240
running out of time here um

984
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:18,160
i don't know does anybody have any final

985
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:21,440
thoughts for for the attendees before um

986
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:24,880
we we say goodbye

987
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:34,000
you're killing me somebody say something

988
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:36,560
it was lovely to chat with everyone it

989
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:38,480
was good yeah it was good to chat with

990
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:40,560
you guys um i guess for the attendees

991
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:41,040
like

992
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:42,400
you said you've heard us talk about a

993
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:44,320
bunch of different topics um over the

994
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:45,440
last hour

995
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:47,040
but it a lot of the stuff that we talked

996
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:49,200
about came back to foundational

997
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:51,119
security and a lot of the challenges

998
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:52,720
that we're facing are

999
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:54,400
are still foundational issues that we've

1000
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:55,920
been battling for 20

1001
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:59,359
30 plus years and so um

1002
00:37:59,359 --> 00:38:00,880
you know we've gotten better at some

1003
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:02,880
things but sometimes it feels like we

1004
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:04,320
take two steps forward or

1005
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:05,920
you know one step forward and two steps

1006
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:09,119
back um but uh

1007
00:38:09,119 --> 00:38:10,720
but yeah keep fighting the good fight

1008
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:12,160
out there and

1009
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:15,598
we'll keep fighting it alongside you

1010
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:19,520
i hope all of you in real

1011
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:22,560
places in next year

1012
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:23,920
that's all right hopefully we'll all be

1013
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:26,079
side by side next year

1014
00:38:26,079 --> 00:38:30,720
yeah yeah i want to meet all next year

1015
00:38:30,839 --> 00:38:33,440
yeah

1016
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:36,640
all right i think in the in next year it

1017
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:39,920
