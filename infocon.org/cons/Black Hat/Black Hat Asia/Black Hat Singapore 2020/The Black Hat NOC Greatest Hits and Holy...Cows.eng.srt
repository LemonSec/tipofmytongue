provides

31
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:04,319
firewalls and our core infrastructure uh

32
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:05,920
rsa for monitoring

33
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:09,200
um all of our packet and log collection

34
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:12,159
cisco provides us with uh opendns as

35
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:13,040
well as

36
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:17,600
um the sandboxing are um

37
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:20,400
man i just forgot the name threat grid

38
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:20,960
thank you

39
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:23,840
centurylink uh provides our bandwidth in

40
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:24,400
vegas

41
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,080
uh ruckus provides all of our wireless

42
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:28,240
as well as switching uh and then gigamon

43
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:30,240
our taps to feed all of our tools with

44
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,079
the interesting traffic that you guys

45
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:35,439
uh would normally provide us so yeah um

46
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:37,600
so i think you know i left the one with

47
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,040
centurylink on there because i figured

48
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,720
this was all of the partners yeah this

49
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:41,200
is

50
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,040
vegas right so this is normally who

51
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,479
would be serving up your delicious

52
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:45,280
packets

53
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,600
um i think another thing too rsa

54
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:48,399
provides

55
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:50,799
endpoint for our registration machines

56
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:52,240
and then also

57
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:53,840
our identity and access management

58
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:56,079
solution as well so uh we'll get into

59
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:56,640
why

60
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,399
we have these different technologies

61
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:00,240
here shortly uh but though

62
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:02,560
that makes up the team right the broader

63
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:03,360
team

64
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,680
um but this is the actual team right so

65
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:06,479
this is from

66
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:09,598
2019 this is the u.s team so this is the

67
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:10,479
vegas show

68
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:12,879
you can see it's a pretty big group it's

69
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:14,160
made up of

70
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:18,160
primarily most of our friends and then

71
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:20,879
the folks that the partners send they're

72
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:22,319
industry professionals they're

73
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:24,720
security or network professionals and

74
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,800
they take their vacation to come and

75
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:27,680
hang out with us

76
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:30,080
and um and set up the knock normally

77
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,160
it's not as bright as you see

78
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,800
uh there in the picture the lights are

79
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,560
usually turned down that's how we like

80
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,040
it

81
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:39,599
uh but that that's the crew so we have

82
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:41,120
our our knock partners

83
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:44,239
and then the um extended knock family so

84
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:45,920
that's that's what makes up the us

85
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:48,800
team um you can see there's a bit of a

86
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:49,760
difference

87
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,440
between the us show and what an

88
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,200
international show looks like

89
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:56,800
so this is the team from the 2019

90
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,519
europe show so that was december

91
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:00,080
december

92
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:04,080
december that seems like so long ago

93
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,720
yeah um but that you can see that the

94
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,319
team is much smaller

95
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:11,440
um it is again uh made up of

96
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,680
of a couple of of core folks for the

97
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,120
from the knock team and then some folks

98
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:15,840
that the

99
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,319
knock partner send as well and they

100
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:19,040
really are

101
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:21,280
our partners this is not something where

102
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,800
these individuals have

103
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,680
sponsored the knock and so they've paid

104
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:26,799
x amount of money to have their

105
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:27,760
equipment in there

106
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:30,159
it's genuinely like a discussion that

107
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:31,360
myself and bart

108
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,440
and uh and another one of our buddies um

109
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:34,720
steve fink have

110
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,799
where we discuss like what's the right

111
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:37,840
technology

112
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,920
have things changed what is our

113
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,840
satisfaction been with the difference

114
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,920
our needs change from year to year show

115
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,040
to show as well so there's different

116
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,480
things and it's it's a it's a true

117
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,080
procurement process of those

118
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,799
partners yeah and it's uh it's great

119
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:51,680
like we

120
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,280
have been fortunate enough that anyone

121
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,799
that we have approached to

122
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:57,360
try to you know partner with us has been

123
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,120
very very receptive to

124
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,599
coming in and being part of the noc team

125
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:02,640
and providing

126
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,799
not only equipment or software but also

127
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:05,840
folks they're a

128
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:08,640
team folks to back it up so you saw the

129
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:08,959
the

130
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:12,159
giant crew here for the us show and then

131
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:12,480
now

132
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:15,760
our smaller crew here for international

133
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,199
and like i said this is the

134
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:19,279
europe this year but it mirrors the same

135
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:21,358
amount of folks for the asia show

136
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:24,720
in singapore as well so

137
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:27,280
much like the teams uh between the us

138
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,000
and the international

139
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
show the architecture uh differs quite a

140
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,600
bit obviously and you guys can can

141
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,600
imagine that that has a lot to do with

142
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,400
uh people and and bandwidth obviously

143
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,840
going on at that point so

144
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:40,560
um in vegas we have uh quite a bit more

145
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,000
so palo alto provides some

146
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,880
some very large firewalls excuse me uh

147
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,960
in the 5000 series that we use

148
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:50,400
in an h.a pair gigamon taps traffic on

149
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,520
both sides uh

150
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,440
in and out that we use again for

151
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,040
monitoring and feeding those monitoring

152
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,960
tools

153
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:59,120
ruckus provides all of our our switching

154
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,080
as well as

155
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,560
as access points throughout the venue

156
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,960
and vegas is unique in the way that we

157
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,880
replace pretty much everything except

158
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:09,280
the cables that mandalay bay has so

159
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:12,000
we put in distribution switches as well

160
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,680
as the course which is down in the

161
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:17,919
mdf at that point again feeding rsa

162
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:19,440
one of the big tools that we use from

163
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,199
them is net witness

164
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:22,960
but again as grifter mentioned we do use

165
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,240
them on the endpoints as well as

166
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,479
identity and access management for

167
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:29,280
accessing those tools for a true

168
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:30,160
authorization

169
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,759
of users and we can get into that a

170
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:33,199
little bit more as well as to why that

171
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:34,320
may have evolved

172
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:37,919
um change control it happens to the best

173
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:38,560
of us

174
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:41,120
uh again here centurylink and vegas

175
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,000
provides us

176
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,280
two 10 gig um circuits uh

177
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:47,600
last year you guys did not completely

178
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,039
blow that out but we won't get the

179
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:50,320
chance this year and hopefully we'll see

180
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,280
something yeah it doesn't look like

181
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:52,240
they're gonna hit those numbers this

182
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,039
year either guys

183
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:55,840
you guys are terrible try harder um who

184
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,039
did i miss

185
00:05:57,039 --> 00:06:00,240
uh we got ruckus uh cisco again

186
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:03,520
um feeding uh into threat grid as well

187
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:04,639
as opendns

188
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:07,280
uh so we see all those dns requests uh

189
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:10,240
as well as detonating any type of

190
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:13,600
malicious um attachment package

191
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,960
anything yeah you guys are crazy

192
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,560
basically yeah anything that we see that

193
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,759
could potentially

194
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:19,600
we think host malware will take that

195
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,120
drop it in there see what it does right

196
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:21,680
so

197
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:25,680
um this is the architecture

198
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,600
i saw that you still have to sit there

199
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,520
you always so he always gives me a hard

200
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:30,080
time

201
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:33,120
um as you can see with the us show in

202
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,080
vegas it's it's

203
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,400
much more involved much more

204
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,479
architecturally yeah look at that

205
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:41,680
diverse maybe you'd say it looks cuter

206
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:45,199
it looks better uh genuinely pretty flat

207
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:46,639
in some of the international shows and

208
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:48,080
then between time and all that

209
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,000
i have not made an architecture for

210
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,240
those and he gives me a hard time so

211
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,360
you get to see this if you came to

212
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,360
singapore london it's beautiful

213
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,919
um genuinely if you look at the us

214
00:06:57,919 --> 00:06:59,520
architecture again it's it's

215
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,520
just flatten it and lessen it out a

216
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,120
little bit and then the difference there

217
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,720
though in some cases why it doesn't look

218
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:05,280
as good

219
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,800
we also don't necessarily replace all

220
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,319
the distribution switches at each show

221
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:09,440
that we go to so

222
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,039
there are some v-landings on their

223
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:12,720
backbones etc so

224
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:15,520
um more just not as intriguing so

225
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,000
imagine

226
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,919
it just shrunk a little bit yeah you'll

227
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:19,280
get an idea here in a second when we

228
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,880
talk about the gear

229
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,880
so again talking about specifically what

230
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,479
we had in vegas

231
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:27,759
here's exact uh devices the amount of

232
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:30,319
access points which is again what we get

233
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:31,520
from cisco

234
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:34,639
uh paolo bringing 250 260s and a

235
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:37,039
m200 which is your management box to run

236
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:38,000
which honestly

237
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,199
we probably would have mirrored this

238
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:40,319
year as well there's not i don't think

239
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:42,160
there's a lot of changes that we would i

240
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,039
don't think there would have been

241
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:44,800
many changes at all either it was all

242
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,479
about the same we didn't have any real

243
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:49,039
um architecture ideas nothing that that

244
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:50,080
failed on us no

245
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,680
nothing crazy we're always trying new

246
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,440
tools and different monitoring stuff

247
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,440
uh but outside of that yeah this

248
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,960
genuinely would have would have stayed

249
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:59,039
probably right where it is

250
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:01,039
yeah i mean you can see like that uh

251
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:02,319
like i mean there's quite a bit of stuff

252
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:03,280
that gets sent it

253
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:06,400
it used to be um you know

254
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,800
all of our own gear that we brought um

255
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:09,680
and

256
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,120
when we brought in the partners and

257
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,960
stuff they were just like i said before

258
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,319
super super supportive

259
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:17,199
so we just get like pallets like pallets

260
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:18,080
of gear

261
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,599
in a lot of ways though too it helps so

262
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:21,680
we would when we they send their a teams

263
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,280
and we've asked that they provide

264
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:26,240
that professional aspect and people that

265
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,919
you know pros on their equipment it's

266
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:29,440
usually a lot easier for them to do some

267
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:30,319
of those things

268
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:32,240
with the bigger equipment with the other

269
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,760
pallets worth of of

270
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,760
devices that we're trying to do and

271
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:36,958
again we'll get into how these guys

272
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:38,320
partner quite a bit in the evolution of

273
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,120
things but

274
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,519
uh it it helps them on their equipment

275
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:42,240
as well there are

276
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:45,200
plenty of um things that are found at

277
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,200
black hat and and features that have

278
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,800
have come to grow because of the things

279
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,320
that we've done with these partners and

280
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,120
stuff so

281
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:55,279
um benefits all of us for sure yeah

282
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:57,680
so what was this singapore do you

283
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:58,560
remember off the top of your head

284
00:08:58,560 --> 00:08:59,920
they're about the same again it's it's

285
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,519
not too big different between

286
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:03,760
london and singapore but as you can see

287
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:04,640
again

288
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:07,200
pretty much just less of what we had so

289
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:07,920
a

290
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,920
few saps as you can see we don't have

291
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,680
switches that we're replacing the walls

292
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:14,080
the distribution switches uh we go from

293
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,320
the 5000 series down to 3000 series with

294
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,680
palo alto

295
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:18,959
and then for the most part it's just

296
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:21,120
less storage for net witness so

297
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,959
again not as many packets not as much to

298
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:24,320
look through there but

299
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,640
for the most part just a little bit less

300
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,720
a little less bandwidth as well but

301
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:31,200
um i like there too i think maybe this

302
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,040
was a asia show because the

303
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:35,760
access points went from 22 to 21 because

304
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:36,880
during the setup

305
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:40,640
we broke when one got smashed so

306
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:43,120
we had brought 22 but uh didn't happen

307
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:46,000
yeah sometimes you know

308
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,279
just do it live right um so

309
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:50,800
you know bart mentioned like the

310
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,640
architecture and how we're feeding a

311
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:53,920
bunch of different tools

312
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,680
and you saw the list of the gear there

313
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,200
and everything that we're well we're

314
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,000
working with

315
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,320
um we also have a significant amount of

316
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,680
dashboards in the knock

317
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:04,320
now it looks like a knock would look

318
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,360
right that

319
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,360
darkened room war game style bunch of

320
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,440
large displays with all kinds of shiny

321
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,040
things on them nerds sleeping under the

322
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:11,600
table

323
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:14,800
yeah that's how we roll um but that like

324
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,480
the reality is the dashboards that we

325
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:16,800
have

326
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:19,519
up are actually useful to us we populate

327
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:20,880
them with things that we need to know

328
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,640
about the network

329
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:25,040
you saw there in the center that one's

330
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,399
always very shiny we put up on a

331
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:28,000
projector in the corner

332
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,839
it gets a lot of attention that tool is

333
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:31,279
called oip and

334
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:33,279
oip what it's doing essentially is

335
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:34,720
looking at the most active hosts on the

336
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,079
network and how they're

337
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:38,640
communicating with each other like is

338
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:39,839
like tcp

339
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:42,079
is is in green here i'll go back and

340
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:42,959
start the

341
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:47,040
video again so um tcp is green

342
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:50,560
udp is red icmp is white um and so if we

343
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:52,640
see somebody do something like a scan

344
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:55,200
there'll be a large amount of of white

345
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,959
you know like traffic just

346
00:10:56,959 --> 00:11:00,000
flying out or um the size of the blob is

347
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:00,480
also

348
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:01,839
representative of the size of the

349
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:03,040
package so there's some interesting

350
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,640
stuff to see that and kind of understand

351
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:05,600
again if it's

352
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,519
a scan as opposed to download slash

353
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:09,200
upload etc you're gonna see

354
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,680
you you would see that so it's very

355
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,600
visually helpful yeah yeah so for us

356
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,399
like we'll see

357
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:16,240
like a really like you know this giant

358
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,760
like lightsaber like

359
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:21,519
um bar come up on the oip and we're like

360
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:24,000
whoa like what is that like what's all

361
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:24,800
that traffic

362
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,320
and because we can see what the hosts

363
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,839
are or the ip addresses are that are

364
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:28,959
associated with that

365
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:31,120
we then just pivot over to net witness

366
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,720
we throw those in and we say what kind

367
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,240
of traffic is being passed there is it

368
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,600
something we care about

369
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,839
um you know if we do see scanning or

370
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:38,800
whatever is we're like is this

371
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,720
legitimate to like a classroom activity

372
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,480
or is it somebody trying to hit other

373
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:45,279
individuals on the network it just again

374
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:48,399
i'm punching the microphone

375
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,399
it's just a quick visual representation

376
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:51,839
of us of what's taking place on the

377
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:52,399
network

378
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:54,240
um the dashboards on the side are you

379
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,320
know from from rsa and palo alto and

380
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,200
they populate

381
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:00,160
a a host of different things that we

382
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,760
might be interested like most

383
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:04,959
active um users what um the most active

384
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:06,560
countries are the types of traffic that

385
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,079
are being passed

386
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:09,600
and that changes from show to show too

387
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,880
it's not for sure they're not can

388
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,160
depending on what we're looking for what

389
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:12,880
we've seen

390
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:15,360
etc those those will morph and change

391
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,120
obviously from from show to show and

392
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,959
even day to day day to day yeah like we

393
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:20,320
just walk into the knock in the morning

394
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,680
we just flip a table

395
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:23,279
we're like you give me something fresh

396
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:24,720
but he's gotta do this this is

397
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,560
ridiculous

398
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:28,079
but it is nice to have to be able to

399
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:29,839
have that on the fly changes or we'll

400
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:31,040
say like you know what we really didn't

401
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,320
gain a lot of intel out of that

402
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,760
yesterday let's see can we

403
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,839
replace that with something else and so

404
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:37,360
um just like any

405
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:40,399
normal sock or knock would be we adapt

406
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:41,920
to whatever it is that um

407
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:44,000
is necessary for our needs um so these

408
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,079
are more dashboards so the cisco threat

409
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:47,120
grid dashboard

410
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:49,200
um what you see up there it looks like

411
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,639
like a bar across where a lot of them

412
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:52,079
are black it's like a

413
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:53,839
is is actually virtual machines that

414
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:55,200
kick off each time

415
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,959
that we submit a piece of malware to it

416
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:58,480
so it goes into um

417
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,800
a sandboxer as they term in a glove box

418
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,639
so that you can actually like the cdc

419
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:04,160
does where you get in there and and work

420
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,680
with a virus with your hands and not

421
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,360
infect yourself

422
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,120
that's what it's doing is kicking those

423
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,880
off and uh and you can

424
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,639
manipulate that to your extent that you

425
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:14,399
can as a glove box as opposed to just a

426
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:16,000
sandbox you can you can reach in there

427
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,200
and play with it so you can

428
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,440
interact with that those virtual

429
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:20,480
machines in that malware

430
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,800
yeah it's nice and then the um the

431
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,480
bottom right there is threat connect

432
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:25,279
which is the

433
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:28,000
our new soar um solution that we've been

434
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:28,639
using

435
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:31,120
uh just for the last year and uh i mean

436
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:31,680
we're still

437
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,440
already growing yeah and then for us

438
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:34,720
like because it's a new tool for us

439
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,160
we're still kind of like working out

440
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,839
like what the benefits are that we get

441
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:39,199
from this or that or whatever and that

442
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:40,639
will where continue to change

443
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:45,279
over time and provide more data etc yeah

444
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:48,399
uh darkness yes there's that darkness we

445
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:49,920
were talking about makes for excellent

446
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:52,079
photos

447
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:55,040
but uh the evolution of the knock as a

448
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:55,920
whole so

449
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:59,839
um so my first uh show what year is this

450
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:01,199
so i think this is i think this is my

451
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:01,680
18th

452
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:05,199
20th 20th 2020 yeah maybe because i want

453
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:05,680
to

454
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:08,959
because i want to forget um but

455
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:12,560
um so my first show or was

456
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,880
in was the window show we used to do a

457
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:18,079
window show up in seattle

458
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:20,880
i know it's crazy but it is true but um

459
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,320
the first u.s show that i did

460
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:25,440
was um 2003 in las vegas

461
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:28,320
and uh that is the extent of what the

462
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,360
knock

463
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:32,000
looked like in the upper left there so

464
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,040
that's deadhead

465
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:35,760
and he is configuring some cisco access

466
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,440
points that you can see have the orinoco

467
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,120
cards that slot into the top

468
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,880
and then we would literally take those

469
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,040
and then tape antennas

470
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:45,440
like up onto different pillars around

471
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,120
caesar's palace it was crazy

472
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,920
um and then the entirety of the um

473
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,279
infrastructure

474
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:53,680
is is on the table in the bottom left

475
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:54,480
where you see

476
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:58,079
a cisco 2600 with a couple of um

477
00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:01,519
little netgear silver switches on it

478
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:04,959
um we were defense in depth so high-tech

479
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:08,160
um but i'll explain why we went from

480
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:08,560
that

481
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:10,480
to what you see on the right which is

482
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,480
the insanity that is the current knock

483
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:15,839
um the uh two individuals there again

484
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:17,839
deadhead in the top and that's com4

485
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:20,160
down on the bottom they pretty much made

486
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,120
up the team it was me

487
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,760
two to three other folks and we just did

488
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:24,880
it now you have the

489
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:26,560
team on the right which is i don't even

490
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:28,800
know what we're up to now

491
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:31,759
yeah i mean between our guys 21ish and

492
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:32,560
then

493
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:36,160
2010 then they're teams 30 40 other

494
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:38,800
defender folks so yeah we're talking 75

495
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:39,360
people

496
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:41,040
total that rotate through the knock and

497
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,880
uh given

498
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:46,240
the u.s show yeah it is kind of gross

499
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:49,600
i do miss it all right so um

500
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:52,160
so you can see that's what the um what

501
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:54,079
it evolved from was essentially

502
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:56,079
that on the left with a couple of

503
00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:58,320
switches a single router

504
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,560
some cisco access points with antennas

505
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,160
taped to the wall to what we have on the

506
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:02,560
right

507
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:05,839
and the insane uh scale that it that's

508
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:07,360
gone to now but

509
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,040
what you're looking at on the left the

510
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:11,440
us show was about approximately 1200

511
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:12,720
people i think at the time

512
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:15,279
and now last year was like 20 000. so

513
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:17,279
the the international shows are bigger

514
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:18,160
than that of this yeah

515
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:20,320
yeah the international shows which used

516
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:23,279
to be 200 to 300 right um attendees

517
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:25,040
now now we're even more than that a

518
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,399
couple thousand so

519
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:28,399
um so i guess let's talk about that

520
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:30,160
evolution like how did we

521
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:32,240
end up going from that tiny little

522
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,320
couple of things to what we have today

523
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:35,519
you ever notice he doesn't actually

524
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:37,839
evolve i know it

525
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:40,639
the the gif actually messes with me a

526
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:41,920
little bit if i'm honest

527
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:45,360
because you really want it to just like

528
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,600
if it's just hard to keep it up that

529
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:48,560
would be try it out

530
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:51,759
um but um but yeah so

531
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:55,680
we um we had to evolve as the needs of

532
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:57,440
the network change but the biggest need

533
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:58,240
initially

534
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:00,800
was just stability right so the network

535
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:01,920
black hat would go down

536
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,759
all the time it was you know up

537
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:05,679
approximately 50 percent of the time

538
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:08,000
in previous shows um when i came on at

539
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,079
that us show that was my first time

540
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:12,240
running the network my like myself with

541
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,439
a couple of friends

542
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:15,599
and our our goal was just to keep the

543
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:16,559
network up

544
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:18,880
at one point um and we did that we were

545
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,079
successful we kept the

546
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:21,919
network up for a hundred percent of the

547
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:23,439
time ninety-nine percent

548
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:24,640
ninety-eight percent i don't know what

549
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,400
it fifteen minutes it went down it went

550
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:27,599
down for fifteen minutes

551
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:30,400
i'm gonna do the math and here's why um

552
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:31,840
so those cisco access points that i

553
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:32,799
talked about

554
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:36,320
we um like apparently they when they

555
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:36,720
were

556
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,480
uh i was wandering around talking to the

557
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:39,840
different trainers and stuff i'm poking

558
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:41,120
my heads in classrooms i knew the

559
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:42,720
network went down we cycled them

560
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,160
everything came up fine we're like oh

561
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,000
that was weird um

562
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,440
walked into a class talked to the

563
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,200
trainer and i said and he said hey did

564
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,720
the network go down before and i was

565
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,320
like oh yeah i did i'm really sorry

566
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:52,799
about that

567
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:54,320
we got everything back up it seems to be

568
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:56,240
good and he's like oh yeah i was showing

569
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:57,840
the class this new vulnerability i just

570
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:59,280
found it's unpatched

571
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:01,600
like you know oh days like and i'm like

572
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,360
thanks dude that's my live production

573
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:04,320
network he just

574
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:07,280
blew off um you know the the face of the

575
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:07,760
earth

576
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:10,000
as a demo a live demo but that's old

577
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:10,880
school black hat

578
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,960
those are the days just turning it off

579
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,000
and turning back on again

580
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,799
yeah so totally so stability was one of

581
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:18,080
the biggest reasons and still today

582
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:20,000
that's probably one of our our biggest

583
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,440
concerns um obviously uh as attendees

584
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:24,480
coming for

585
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:27,120
trainings is is probably our biggest

586
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,080
stability concern

587
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:30,320
with with students doing labs et cetera

588
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:32,400
uh cloud labs

589
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,320
a lot of trainers have moved all of

590
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:37,039
their uh labs and exploitations etc to

591
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:38,080
cloud so

592
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:40,000
um that was that was kind of a big shift

593
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,280
for us and we worked with

594
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:42,799
a lot of those trainers when that that

595
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:44,720
shift really started um

596
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,720
but but again stability is probably our

597
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,880
biggest concern these days for for those

598
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,160
reasons

599
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,760
shifting from there security and

600
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:53,120
segmentation because of some of the

601
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:54,840
stories that grifter told

602
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:57,840
um obviously we're a big deal to to kind

603
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:59,440
of get into outside of the

604
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:02,240
the cisco aps and again the the

605
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,760
evolution of where it's really come even

606
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:04,559
since i was

607
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:09,120
was around um is has been tenfold so

608
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:10,559
security's starting obviously so we

609
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:12,320
don't have classes hacking other classes

610
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:12,960
where

611
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:15,679
whether intentionally or unintentionally

612
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:16,240
um

613
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:17,919
obviously we don't want anybody to ruin

614
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:19,520
anyone else's experience because they

615
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:20,640
don't know what they're doing or

616
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,000
because they do know what they're doing

617
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,280
it was intentional it was very

618
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:24,880
intentional

619
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,080
but i can tell you there have been

620
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:27,600
plenty that were unintentional as well

621
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:28,559
just just the

622
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:31,919
um shiny new toy you don't necessarily

623
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:32,240
know

624
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,919
fully what you're doing things have

625
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:35,760
happened yeah um

626
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:37,440
segmentation obviously plays into that a

627
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,200
lot of the network architecture

628
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:41,919
tools that we've had um the way that

629
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:42,400
we've

630
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,000
locked down and even architected the

631
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,320
shows from from year to year has changed

632
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:47,840
uh to try and grow with that and

633
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:49,919
obviously um with the equipment that

634
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:52,080
we've had that changing from

635
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:53,440
initially not having all the

636
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,280
distribution switches and having control

637
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:55,679
from

638
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:57,840
front end to end we kind of had to make

639
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:00,480
some some

640
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,200
sacrifices if you will as to as far as

641
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,640
the architecture and security at that

642
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:05,440
point

643
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:08,240
that's grown uh and obviously between

644
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,360
ruckus being able to provide the

645
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:10,159
switching

646
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:13,280
access points the security uh from palo

647
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:14,799
alto and everything else that's

648
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:16,480
those have really been hammered home i

649
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:17,600
feel like and we're in a pretty good

650
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:18,240
place

651
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:20,000
uh today with with what we're dealing

652
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,919
with stability security

653
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:24,080
and segmentation wise and i'll let

654
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:25,120
grifter dig into some of the other

655
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:26,000
things that we've

656
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,760
um so you know that's thing like once we

657
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,440
have stuff where it's stable

658
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:32,320
it's secure everybody's not attacking

659
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:33,280
each other

660
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:36,640
uh at least as frequently um

661
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:39,120
or accidentally then you know we're like

662
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:41,039
well we want to gain some additional

663
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:42,480
knowledge about what's taking place on

664
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:43,679
the network like what is

665
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:45,039
actually like you read all these

666
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:47,120
articles as as any large conference

667
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,400
starts to approach where it's like oh

668
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,520
here's how you

669
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:50,880
should behave when you're on this type

670
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:53,039
of network or oh should you even get on

671
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:54,159
the black hat network

672
00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:55,440
i've written one of those articles

673
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:57,360
myself um where

674
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:00,640
it's like um you know is it actually

675
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:03,120
that bad like what is genuinely going on

676
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:04,559
if you're if you're not currently

677
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:06,000
experiencing attack

678
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,360
um is it just because you're not

679
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:09,200
detecting it or is it because it's not

680
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,000
happening

681
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,760
um so we wanted to go look and that's

682
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:13,840
where we started to decide okay well we

683
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:15,520
want operational intelligence like

684
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:16,000
active

685
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,919
like what's taking place so that's when

686
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:20,320
we reached out to rsa

687
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:23,360
um and brought uh our

688
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:25,520
well they weren't the first ones i won't

689
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:27,360
name names for folks who we used to be

690
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:28,080
there before

691
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,360
and that one didn't really grow anywhere

692
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:31,679
that was no yeah but we wanted to gain

693
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:32,480
some additional

694
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:34,080
uh you know knowledge about the network

695
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:36,000
and so what rsa brought to the table for

696
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,360
us was the ability to

697
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:38,720
capture all the logs from all the

698
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,559
different devices that we had capture

699
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:43,200
um raw packets so that we could rebuild

700
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,480
sessions and see what was actually

701
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:45,600
taking place

702
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:49,760
um and then um you know have a real idea

703
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:52,400
about is this actually one of the most

704
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,159
dangerous networks in the world to be

705
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:57,760
on and so we could rebuild what attacks

706
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:00,000
were taking place and start to carve out

707
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,520
is this um is this bad bad like actual

708
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,000
bad

709
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,559
or is this just like normal bad good bad

710
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:08,000
yeah black hat bad

711
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,360
right on a typical yeah on a regular

712
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:13,120
day at black hat the types of stuff that

713
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:14,960
you would see on a normal uh day at

714
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,080
black hat is the

715
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:18,400
things that would turn some analysts you

716
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,240
know or ceso's hair white

717
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:23,679
uh in any other organization

718
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:27,120
so we had to say like okay well let's

719
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:28,640
find out what's actually bad and what

720
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:29,120
isn't

721
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,720
and we find some interesting stuff doing

722
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:32,159
that as well now when

723
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:34,240
we were doing that hunting there were

724
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,760
times where we would find

725
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:38,400
um you know binaries or what looked like

726
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,600
potential malware

727
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,440
and we didn't have at the time the

728
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:42,880
ability to you know

729
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,559
to throw it in the sandbox and see what

730
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:46,159
it did so we were like oh we should add

731
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:46,720
that

732
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:50,000
and um and we had a friend a

733
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:50,880
relationship

734
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:54,000
from the past and jessica bear from

735
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,280
cisco who in talking to her we were like

736
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,640
hey it would be cool if you guys could

737
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:00,559
come they were like great we'd love to

738
00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:01,120
come

739
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:03,360
and now we had threat grid um in the

740
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:04,480
knock as well

741
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:07,760
and i'll let bart explain where the iam

742
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:10,159
portion of this comes into our our

743
00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:11,760
evolution so we're not we're not

744
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:13,520
throwing anybody under the bus as we

745
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:15,280
said today however there was definitely

746
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:17,520
an incident in the past where we

747
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:22,400
um with another partner had

748
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,000
basically come back in the morning after

749
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,559
some issues and there was some

750
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:29,200
security concerns by said partner and

751
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,280
those people that were there that

752
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:35,120
there was some firmware changes made to

753
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:36,960
the equipment overnight with the best

754
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,799
intentions best intentions it was

755
00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:41,520
absolutely somebody that

756
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:44,640
was trying to do right uh but it pretty

757
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,080
much bricked all of those

758
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:49,360
access points and it took us hours i

759
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:50,559
think there's a couple hours in the

760
00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:52,080
morning to get the network back up and

761
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:52,960
running basically

762
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:55,440
so uh that was not a fun morning and

763
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:56,799
that was one of the

764
00:23:56,799 --> 00:23:58,880
um aha moments that we needed to be able

765
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,080
to have control of that

766
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:02,240
everybody was basically using the same

767
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:04,480
admin account so uh

768
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:07,440
not that we would have necessarily

769
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:08,640
stopped it but we would have known about

770
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:09,360
it and could have taken that

771
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:11,200
responsibility it's not on somebody else

772
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,880
uh if we go through that and make that

773
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,720
decision i can tell you we probably

774
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,080
wouldn't have

775
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:17,760
right before class started it would be

776
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:19,679
an end of the day type of thing but

777
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:21,600
uh that was definitely a big piece to us

778
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:22,799
to be able to

779
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:25,440
uh keep that control make sure that uh

780
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:27,679
any changes that were being made

781
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:30,480
anywhere were at least uh rubber stamped

782
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:33,360
if nothing else by grifter fink and i so

783
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:36,640
um it it has definitely helped

784
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:39,840
i can say that there are times that it's

785
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:41,679
not the most convenient thing which i

786
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:43,520
mean is typical in

787
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:46,720
in any typical security typical of any

788
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:48,320
thing that you are are dealing with in

789
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:51,200
that environment in a normal world

790
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,720
but we've made it work and we've done

791
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:54,720
what we had to do so that we can control

792
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:56,480
that and at least again

793
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:57,520
if nothing else just take the

794
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:59,679
responsibility if we do it then then we

795
00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:01,039
do it and we'll take responsibility for

796
00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:02,000
that but when you feel like you're

797
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,360
cleaning up somebody else's mess it was

798
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:04,960
definitely um

799
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:06,720
a frustrating afternoon it was the

800
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:08,799
longest outage that we've ever had and

801
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:10,240
up to that point i can't remember how

802
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:11,600
many years it was but it was but i had

803
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:12,480
been doing nothing

804
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:14,240
over a decade and bart had been doing it

805
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,520
multiple years as well

806
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:18,240
so for us it was a big hit to our um our

807
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:20,480
egos i guess you know to just be like oh

808
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:22,400
like we fell on our faces there let's

809
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:24,240
immediately solve it with technology and

810
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:26,400
then

811
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:29,279
now it's fake um but yeah and then um

812
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:31,440
the end point decision was

813
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:33,840
that was much more recent yeah and that

814
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:35,120
kind of goes hand in hand with

815
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:36,640
decryption and scaring people with what

816
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:37,440
we're talking about

817
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:40,960
so i i would say and we'll just kind of

818
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:42,240
get that out of the way real quick so

819
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:44,159
endpoint and decryption are both on our

820
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:45,279
registration machines

821
00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:48,320
so basically what that was intended for

822
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:50,480
uh was those are the only machines that

823
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:52,640
we quote unquote control that are

824
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,480
within our purview obviously if you guys

825
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:56,640
come onto the network we're not looking

826
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:58,320
to man in the middle anything we've told

827
00:25:58,320 --> 00:25:59,679
you that will never happen under our

828
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:00,559
watch and that

829
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:03,679
stands today um end point obviously

830
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:04,960
we're not pushing anything to your

831
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:06,240
devices there so

832
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:07,760
endpoint and decryption are specifically

833
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:09,440
that again we've talked about it

834
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:10,000
registration

835
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,320
really kind of being um that's our

836
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:13,840
information as well as yours that's kind

837
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:14,960
of the key to the kingdom that we'll

838
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:16,400
make sure that we protect from you get

839
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:17,760
for you guys as well as

840
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:19,679
you know for us and and obviously the

841
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:21,520
organization he said from you guys

842
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:24,320
from the guys from for i mean it's the

843
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:25,760
same thing

844
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:28,960
both of you and then uh

845
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:31,600
so the endpoint uh protection is is

846
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:33,679
literally just that so we monitor

847
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:35,679
um typical changes we can lock down that

848
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:37,039
endpoint make sure that nobody's

849
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:38,720
modifying

850
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,640
what's there for protection of those

851
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,320
systems obviously we can see all that

852
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:44,480
and everything's phoning home that way

853
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:46,559
then decryption is is the same as well

854
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:48,240
but we are doing it only from the

855
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:49,600
registration to the

856
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,200
backend database to basically make sure

857
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:53,120
that nothing was

858
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:55,200
injected or anything else happened or

859
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:57,120
added that we couldn't see because of

860
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:58,480
that so now we have

861
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:00,960
full visibility into uh the actual

862
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:03,520
registration process and can see

863
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:06,400
encrypted decrypted whether anything bad

864
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,080
has happened so

865
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:09,679
that's really kind of grown again we've

866
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:11,919
we've gotten a tighter grip around

867
00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:13,679
registration we feel like and and that's

868
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:16,640
certainly come over the years again with

869
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,240
the tools that have become available to

870
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:19,760
us as well so

871
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:21,200
that took some time let me talk about

872
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:22,880
automation sure um

873
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:25,120
so the automation piece comes from i

874
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:26,559
guess some of the things that we started

875
00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:27,360
discovering

876
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:29,679
once we introduced the you know the

877
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:31,039
hunting ability like looking through

878
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:32,399
logs looking through the packets and

879
00:27:32,399 --> 00:27:33,520
that kind of thing we

880
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:36,399
started to notice command and control

881
00:27:36,399 --> 00:27:38,159
traffic that would immediately

882
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:40,399
start when devices were added to the

883
00:27:40,399 --> 00:27:41,760
network

884
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:44,240
we see a lot of clear tech stuff still

885
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:45,360
on the network

886
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:46,880
i say a lot we'll get into that a little

887
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:48,480
bit more in a bit but

888
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:50,159
there's still too much i guess is what i

889
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:52,000
should say um so we see a lot of clear

890
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,600
text emails and things going back and

891
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:54,320
forth

892
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:56,159
we um with the rise of of

893
00:27:56,159 --> 00:27:57,760
cryptocurrencies and wherever we saw

894
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:59,039
crypto mining coming from different

895
00:27:59,039 --> 00:27:59,919
devices

896
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:02,240
and what we used to do in the past as we

897
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:03,520
discovered these things was we would

898
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:04,480
literally like

899
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:06,320
hoof it over to a classroom now because

900
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:07,919
of the way that the network is segmented

901
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:08,559
we know

902
00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:09,679
this traffic is coming from this

903
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:10,960
classroom this drive is coming from this

904
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:12,399
classroom or it's coming from this

905
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:14,240
access point those type of things

906
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:17,679
so we would you know isolate it to a

907
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:18,640
particular class

908
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,720
see if the attack or that traffic was

909
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:22,240
something that was normal considered

910
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:23,679
normal for that class

911
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:25,279
if it looked like it was out of the

912
00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:26,720
ordinary then we would just say all

913
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:28,080
right well let's head down there and go

914
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:29,600
see if we can talk to somebody

915
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,520
and then we would go into the class and

916
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:33,279
say hey

917
00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:35,360
whoever has ip address blah blah blah

918
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:36,880
can we talk to you for a second

919
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:38,559
and they would be like oh it's the knock

920
00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:40,399
guys you know and they would make that

921
00:28:40,399 --> 00:28:43,440
walk of shame to the back of the class

922
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:44,640
so that we could talk to them and say

923
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:47,360
hey we're seeing this from your device

924
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:50,000
um a lot of the times we get a like no

925
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:50,640
you're not

926
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:53,760
or that's not possible or i'm doing this

927
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:54,880
or i'm doing that

928
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:57,360
um and we have to prove it with data but

929
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:57,919
you know p

930
00:28:57,919 --> 00:29:00,799
capper didn't happen so we got the p cap

931
00:29:00,799 --> 00:29:02,399
so we can show you exactly where it's

932
00:29:02,399 --> 00:29:03,200
happening

933
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:06,640
so it the scale again as the show scaled

934
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:08,320
and and the number of those types of

935
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:09,440
incidents increased

936
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:11,120
it wasn't possible for us to constantly

937
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:12,559
be leaving the knock and running around

938
00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:13,919
the classrooms trying to tell people

939
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:15,679
like oh you're got this command and

940
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:16,880
control traffic oh it looks like you

941
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,720
have this malware oh it looks like

942
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:21,279
you know uh your vpn is configured

943
00:29:21,279 --> 00:29:22,880
incorrectly that kind of thing

944
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:24,559
and so we another piece of that really

945
00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:26,000
quick was that uh

946
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,679
we obviously don't know where you're at

947
00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:29,360
in briefings so we have

948
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:30,880
more people at that point so to be able

949
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:32,720
to provide that same information to a

950
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:34,080
briefing's attendee that may have shown

951
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,360
up and had

952
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:37,440
command and control con or command

953
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:41,279
control conquer command and concrete

954
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:44,799
we wouldn't be able to track you down

955
00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:46,480
and basically give you that information

956
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:47,679
so it was more of a

957
00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:49,039
safety for you guys but that kind of

958
00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:50,720
involved a

959
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:52,320
the scale and being able to walk to

960
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:54,399
every classroom but b is well telling

961
00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:57,360
telling you during briefings so here's

962
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:58,080
how we did that

963
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:00,720
right we said okay if we can't run to

964
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:01,440
every class

965
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:04,240
like let's at least you know find a way

966
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:05,679
to deliver a message to these

967
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:07,279
individuals so that they can

968
00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:08,880
uh they can see something and in the

969
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:10,399
briefings like you said you can't track

970
00:30:10,399 --> 00:30:11,760
you could track them down to an access

971
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:12,640
point but then you run out in the

972
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,399
hallway

973
00:30:14,399 --> 00:30:17,919
like it doesn't work um so um so what we

974
00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:19,600
ended up doing was saying okay if we

975
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:20,080
sear

976
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:23,600
see we see here if we see whatever

977
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:26,799
that's like we're done if we see clear

978
00:30:26,799 --> 00:30:27,520
text account

979
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:29,520
creds we see something that we can

980
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:31,120
confirm looks like command controller

981
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:31,840
malware

982
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:35,440
um or crypto mining will you know

983
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:37,520
what we're gonna do is say all right

984
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:39,440
we've seen this traffic we identify it

985
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:40,480
in the packet capture

986
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:42,559
we gain additional intelligence about it

987
00:30:42,559 --> 00:30:43,520
from uh

988
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:45,840
you know the firewall and uh you know

989
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:46,799
our our

990
00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:49,360
core infrastructure we pull all that

991
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:51,120
together we say yes this looks in fact

992
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:52,399
like it is something that

993
00:30:52,399 --> 00:30:55,600
could potentially be bad it then sends

994
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:57,600
bart and i an email that says we saw

995
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:58,240
this thing

996
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:01,120
it looks bad do you agree that we should

997
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:02,399
go ahead and send

998
00:31:02,399 --> 00:31:05,279
them a captive portal and this was

999
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:07,679
basically again

1000
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:09,279
us taking that responsibility so that

1001
00:31:09,279 --> 00:31:11,600
we're not getting false positives

1002
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:13,760
throwing out there to everybody or

1003
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:16,799
for whatever reason that we're seeing

1004
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:18,559
it was it was a piece to be able to stop

1005
00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:20,159
it without just being automated so we're

1006
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:20,880
getting control

1007
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:22,399
giving control to the machine it's just

1008
00:31:22,399 --> 00:31:24,159
like complete control so

1009
00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:26,240
uh we still go through and just a quick

1010
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:28,480
uh review of that we get an email and

1011
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:30,240
basically can hit accept and this

1012
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:31,919
this has all been automated obviously

1013
00:31:31,919 --> 00:31:34,240
through um that back end with

1014
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:38,159
uh threat connect rsa uh palo alto and

1015
00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:39,679
threat grid in some cases are all

1016
00:31:39,679 --> 00:31:41,039
talking to each other throughout this

1017
00:31:41,039 --> 00:31:42,320
process

1018
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:45,039
so that you can see that so captive

1019
00:31:45,039 --> 00:31:46,159
portal i think is also

1020
00:31:46,159 --> 00:31:49,120
kind of a scary word for some people um

1021
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:50,640
quick explanation on that is basically

1022
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:51,760
you would have to hit

1023
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:53,919
a unencrypted website so that we can

1024
00:31:53,919 --> 00:31:55,600
even insert at that point or not

1025
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:57,519
man in the middling anything and there

1026
00:31:57,519 --> 00:31:59,279
is nothing for you to

1027
00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:01,279
enter other than hit continue basically

1028
00:32:01,279 --> 00:32:02,399
to acknowledge it

1029
00:32:02,399 --> 00:32:04,000
as you can see it's basically us just

1030
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,919
letting you know what we saw and hey

1031

what it may or may not be so yeah i mean

1037
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:16,720
if you're if you're genuinely crypto

1038
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:18,640
mining off of your machine at black hat

1039
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:20,080
whatever reason to come talk to yeah you

1040
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:20,640
do you

1041
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:23,919
you can continue and and go ahead

1042
00:32:23,919 --> 00:32:26,799
yay story time crank out a few here real

1043
00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:28,159
quick yeah this is the uh

1044
00:32:28,159 --> 00:32:31,039
the greatest hits portion right so um

1045
00:32:31,039 --> 00:32:33,360
this one's fun

1046
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:36,080
yeah so uh this was always an

1047
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:37,279
interesting thing

1048
00:32:37,279 --> 00:32:39,279
this is even like freshies this wasn't

1049
00:32:39,279 --> 00:32:41,200
as you can see 2019 yeah this is last

1050
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:42,720
year we talked about it a little bit so

1051
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:44,960
you get to get to rehear or brand new if

1052
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:46,240
you aren't in vegas so

1053
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:47,919
um security or something like it so a

1054
00:32:47,919 --> 00:32:50,720
big a big push for security for some

1055
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:52,399
other reasons that may or may not have

1056
00:32:52,399 --> 00:32:53,600
happened in vegas

1057
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:57,120
um uh black hat last year hired an

1058
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:59,279
outside security firm for physical

1059
00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:01,519
security and and some other

1060
00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:05,679
uh aspects of the show um

1061
00:33:05,679 --> 00:33:08,399
well we saw some things interestingly

1062
00:33:08,399 --> 00:33:08,880
enough

1063
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:12,000
uh this was their uh pamphlet or or

1064
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,519
the handout that you want to say that

1065
00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:15,760
they gave to all of their

1066
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:18,640
crew the problem was that it was emailed

1067
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:21,600
on the black cat network to that crew

1068
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:24,640
in the clear so as you can see

1069
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:28,159
all of the explanations of the shirts

1070
00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:28,640
that

1071
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:31,039
our team as well as the cas wear the

1072
00:33:31,039 --> 00:33:32,080
badges

1073
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:35,279
uh telling you how to attack

1074
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:37,200
everything that could ever mean so you

1075
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:40,480
want to counterfeit some stuff

1076
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:42,159
here's a kit for you don't sniff the

1077
00:33:42,159 --> 00:33:43,519
black hat network because that's not

1078
00:33:43,519 --> 00:33:44,320
where you'll find it

1079
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:46,320
yeah it's certainly an interesting one

1080
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:48,000
that again uh

1081
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,440
there's plenty of times we'll we're

1082
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:50,640
gonna laugh at plenty of other people

1083
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:51,840
through this but uh we'll laugh at

1084
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:53,039
ourselves

1085
00:33:53,039 --> 00:33:55,440
yeah i also love this is part of the the

1086
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:57,200
document in there it says um

1087
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:59,039
they hack anything and everything not

1088
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:01,440
maliciously before the fun of it

1089
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:02,880
we don't need this distraction in

1090
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:04,640
security and i'm like we don't need this

1091
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:06,640
distraction in security

1092
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:09,280
that is secure for us that's what we're

1093
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:11,040
here for not a distraction that's my

1094
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:14,480
job um yeah

1095
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:16,719
again and we actually tracked down the

1096
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:17,679
like it was the

1097
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:19,760
head of the security or whatever company

1098
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:20,960
the third party security company that

1099
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:21,760
was educated

1100
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:23,839
we tried to educate him that's what i'll

1101
00:34:23,839 --> 00:34:25,839
say because then he did it again

1102
00:34:25,839 --> 00:34:27,679
and we had like go back and be like dude

1103
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:28,960
still no um

1104
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:31,119
so but yeah so that was pretty funny we

1105
00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:32,719
like when like if we laugh at others we

1106
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:35,359
can laugh at ourselves

1107
00:34:35,359 --> 00:34:37,760
oh yeah so this one uh clear texture

1108
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:38,399
encrypted

1109
00:34:38,399 --> 00:34:42,000
basically strong passwords that were

1110
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:45,040
unencrypted so you can have the

1111
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:47,359
longest craziest generated password in

1112
00:34:47,359 --> 00:34:48,320
the world

1113
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:51,199
um but if you're logging in with it in

1114
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:52,159
the clear

1115
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:56,000
that's not good good try do you two

1116
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,760
it's a solid effort uh there's some

1117
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:58,800
other stories like that i don't know

1118
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,400
that we have them in here yeah or was

1119
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:01,200
that

1120
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:04,560
the the password or the passwords for

1121
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:07,599
uh cameras and stuff the the visual oh

1122
00:35:07,599 --> 00:35:08,160
it's not

1123
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:10,480
good but yes that is just just different

1124
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:11,599
things like that again

1125
00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:12,960
and and we always say this and it's

1126
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:14,720
catchphrase trust but verify do it at

1127
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:16,800
home do a quick packet capture on your

1128
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:18,240
home network and see if you're seeing

1129
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:20,160
anything that

1130
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:21,520
you don't want us to see when you show

1131
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:23,599
up to the show yeah the i will say

1132
00:35:23,599 --> 00:35:25,119
as far as the the clear text and

1133
00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:26,960
encrypted stuff though goes is that like

1134
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:29,280
overall the amount of traffic that we

1135
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:32,800
have seen is uh has the encryption has

1136
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:35,119
gone up steadily over the years like

1137
00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:37,599
since we started tracking it it has gone

1138
00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:38,400
up um

1139
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:39,680
you know over the years so that's been

1140
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:42,079
really really great to see um now one of

1141
00:35:42,079 --> 00:35:43,200
the things you always hear

1142
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:45,760
is like you know oh i use a vpn views a

1143
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:47,760
vpn use vpn

1144
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:50,000
now yes you should use a vpn

1145
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,240
unfortunately in this case

1146
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:55,200
this vpn was just i don't know made by a

1147
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:56,560
five-year-old or something

1148
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:57,760
because yeah that's insulting a

1149
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:59,760
five-year-old but what i did was it

1150
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:00,480
passed the

1151
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:02,720
um the credentials before establishing

1152
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:04,800
the tunnel in the clear and then came

1153
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:06,400
back and said just so i'm clear

1154
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:09,359
is this how you were uh you know are

1155
00:36:09,359 --> 00:36:10,560
these the credentials you were passing

1156
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:11,920
me i just want to make sure i got these

1157
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:13,359
standards at least

1158
00:36:13,359 --> 00:36:16,640
so that that hurt oh

1159
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:19,520
man yeah so you know i'll since i talked

1160
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:20,880
about the vpns i'll take this one really

1161
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:22,800
quick too so this one was one where

1162
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:24,480
we saw some documents coming across the

1163
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:26,160
network in the clear of a very sensitive

1164
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:27,920
nature significant amount of financial

1165
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:28,640
documents

1166
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:30,720
and we're like hey what is the you know

1167
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:31,839
what is the deal here

1168
00:36:31,839 --> 00:36:33,599
so this is one where i did go down to

1169
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:34,720
the class because i was like this is

1170
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:36,560
enough stuff and it was bad enough very

1171
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:38,480
personal yeah that i went down and

1172
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:39,920
talked to the guy and he was like and i

1173
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:41,280
said hey i'm seeing this and this and of

1174
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:42,720
course it was no you're not i'm using a

1175
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:43,520
vpn

1176
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:45,359
and i said look i assure you that i am

1177
00:36:45,359 --> 00:36:47,599
and he said no i'm using look the icon

1178
00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:48,880
looking see it's green

1179
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:50,320
and i said okay well you have this much

1180
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:52,000
left on your mortgage and he was like

1181
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:52,640
what

1182
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:54,400
but you can see and i'm like something's

1183
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:55,680
not right um

1184
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:57,040
and essentially what had happened was he

1185
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:58,720
had the vpn was connected but he had

1186
00:36:58,720 --> 00:36:59,920
split tunneling set up

1187
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:01,119
and so some of the stuff that he was

1188
00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:02,560
sending out wasn't going over the

1189
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:04,079
encrypted portion of the network

1190
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:06,079
and i was like why would you be sending

1191
00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:07,440
this type of stuff at black cat and he

1192
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:08,560
was like well my son's going to

1193
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:09,520
university

1194
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:11,599
in the fall and i had to you know do

1195
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:13,280
stuff for financial aid

1196
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:15,680
and i'm like well it's all out there now

1197
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:16,320
so

1198
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:19,520
careful careful school for free

1199
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:22,079
zero day o day or same day we uh we have

1200
00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:23,760
seen a little bit of this where

1201
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:27,280
um we have seen exploits that were

1202
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:28,400
talked about

1203
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:31,920
that day then show up on the network um

1204
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:33,200
how long was this one how much

1205
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:36,560
12 hours 12 hours so

1206
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:38,160
uh there's plenty of stories that we've

1207
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:39,520
seen you guys when we get into some

1208
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:40,480
other stuff i believe here

1209
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:42,240
you gotta fly though real quick and and

1210
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:44,560
you you you like to try things out after

1211
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:45,359
you learn them just

1212
00:37:45,359 --> 00:37:47,359
uh just know how to do it from stage to

1213
00:37:47,359 --> 00:37:49,119
network uh you know and

1214
00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:50,880
trying to be actively exploited in 12

1215
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:52,960
hours so uh this one we always talk

1216
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:54,800
about look look at traffic look at irc

1217
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:56,000
traffic look at those things

1218
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,240
in this case you can see uh you know

1219
00:37:58,240 --> 00:37:59,680
some private messages down there at the

1220
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:01,440
bottom from an individual saying like

1221
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:02,000
hey

1222
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,440
do you want to essentially take your

1223
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:05,520
hack raf and go try it out at the luxor

1224
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:06,160
later

1225
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:08,079
um it's not a good idea to go messing

1226
00:38:08,079 --> 00:38:09,760
around with security at casinos they've

1227
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:11,440
been doing it a lot longer than you i

1228
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:12,400
assure you

1229
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:15,440
um they also have a very

1230
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:18,640
yeah they like a hands-on approach to

1231
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:20,400
security in las vegas

1232
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:22,320
and so don't get disappeared yeah don't

1233
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:24,320
get disappeared we uh we also have a

1234
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:25,839
a very good relationship with those guys

1235
00:38:25,839 --> 00:38:29,920
too so oh yeah we snitched on you sorry

1236
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:32,240
they do the same um so again to this

1237
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:33,200
whole extent

1238
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:36,480
uh this one specifically uh new attacks

1239
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:37,920
at black hat and then pointing that

1240
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:39,359
public internet is too damn high so

1241
00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:40,480
again if you learn stuff

1242
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:41,920
it's one thing that we see it on the

1243
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:43,839
network again if we're seeing it 12

1244
00:38:43,839 --> 00:38:46,079
hours later is no day it's one thing uh

1245
00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:47,760
specifically what we were talking about

1246
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:49,520
there people were attacking a

1247
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:52,800
um police uh precinct

1248
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:54,240
i think it was their hometown or

1249
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:55,839
something this one was this one was

1250
00:38:55,839 --> 00:38:57,359
europe but there is another one this is

1251
00:38:57,359 --> 00:38:58,960
just an example of one but this one was

1252
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:00,000
europe where we had to go down

1253
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,520
and you can see like when we pull all of

1254
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:02,720
our stuff together we know what

1255
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:03,839
classroom you're in there's a little

1256
00:39:03,839 --> 00:39:05,280
cookie monster getting pointed to on the

1257
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:05,760
bottom

1258
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:07,280
we knew the attack was coming from that

1259
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:09,200
classroom we had to go in and say hey

1260
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:10,960
guys like crime is still illegal

1261
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:13,280
even at black hat so don't target the

1262
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:14,400
public internet

1263
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:16,480
uh we can't save you but yeah we did um

1264
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:17,599
we did see something

1265
00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:19,359
last year or maybe the year prior i

1266
00:39:19,359 --> 00:39:20,480
can't remember it's all blending

1267
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:21,440
together at this point

1268
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:23,839
but uh where an individual learned how

1269
00:39:23,839 --> 00:39:25,359
to use a new tool in a classroom and

1270
00:39:25,359 --> 00:39:26,960
then for whatever reason decided to

1271
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:28,560
target the police department for their

1272
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:29,440
hometown

1273
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:31,440
i like you know everybody needs a hobby

1274
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:32,720
but maybe not that one

1275
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:36,400
life lessons i forgot this one

1276
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:40,160
so this was uh london right and they

1277
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:43,200
um was it a seat change i don't remember

1278
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:45,680
it so a seat change basically all done

1279
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:46,480
through

1280
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:49,520
uh clear uh email

1281
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:51,760
that basically i could have gone and got

1282
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:53,440
on the plane for this person well yeah

1283
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:54,720
that's what was interesting about it is

1284
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:56,480
the stuff that's included in the email

1285
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:57,440
was enough

1286
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:00,000
um information that we could have gone

1287
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,440
and made changes

1288
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:03,520
including changing their flight so we

1289
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:05,280
could say never mind i'm not going

1290
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:06,560
which is why we call this one you're

1291
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:09,040
staying and speaking of tickets

1292
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:11,119
yes um we see other stuff come across

1293
00:40:11,119 --> 00:40:12,720
the network too like

1294
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:14,079
people are going sightseeing while

1295
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:16,000
they're in there so in this case

1296
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:20,319
we we saw the the qr codes or barcodes

1297
00:40:20,319 --> 00:40:21,119
come across

1298
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:22,880
for somebody's planned trip a couple of

1299
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:24,960
days later to go to the london eye

1300
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:27,520
now we could have grabbed those uh

1301
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:28,240
grabbed that

1302
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:30,240
taken that and yeah we've been oh we've

1303
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:31,839
been so

1304
00:40:31,839 --> 00:40:33,440
yeah where were you on that one we

1305
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:36,839
should have we didn't whatever

1306
00:40:36,839 --> 00:40:39,920
um this is legitimately

1307
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:42,800
that in the middle there is the list of

1308
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:44,720
folders that this guy had

1309
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:47,040
in his inbox so and you can see a small

1310
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:48,560
snippet over there on the right hand

1311
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:49,040
side

1312
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:50,560
of the types of things that these

1313
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:52,480
folders were named so when you're doing

1314
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:53,680
your email in the clear

1315
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:56,079
and we see this type of stuff not only

1316
00:40:56,079 --> 00:40:57,680
do we have the current emails that

1317
00:40:57,680 --> 00:40:59,520
you're sending or whatever but we also

1318
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:00,000
have

1319
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,520
you know the list of the way that you

1320
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:03,359
sort those and there was a lot of

1321
00:41:03,359 --> 00:41:05,119
personally identifiable stuff

1322
00:41:05,119 --> 00:41:07,440
or different names uh relationships or

1323
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:09,119
companies that this individual work with

1324
00:41:09,119 --> 00:41:09,760
if you were

1325
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:11,839
planning to attack this person or their

1326
00:41:11,839 --> 00:41:12,800
company you know

1327
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:14,640
any texts that you could build a social

1328
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:16,319
engineering campaign would be just

1329
00:41:16,319 --> 00:41:19,040
ridiculous uh big fix a big broker this

1330
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:20,960
has always been one of my fauna so

1331
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:23,119
uh big fix and i think this we found out

1332
00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:24,640
later this wasn't ibm's fault but

1333
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:26,000
basically long story short another

1334
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,359
security firm was using

1335
00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:30,160
bigfix as a tool internally uh the

1336
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:31,680
problem being that when their machines

1337
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:32,400
phoned home

1338
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:34,640
over the internet to their big fix

1339
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:35,760
device it was

1340
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:37,760
all in the clear so basically any kind

1341
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:39,680
of

1342
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:41,119
information that you needed on that

1343
00:41:41,119 --> 00:41:42,720
machine was full

1344
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:46,000
uh software versions

1345
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,720
os version yeah the reconnaissance part

1346
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:49,040
of your

1347
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:51,040
recon was done you just they said it's

1348
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:52,960
already there so it's there for you um

1349
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:54,640
that has come back up and interestingly

1350
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:56,560
enough they disagreed with us and then

1351
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:58,000
we sent them some more stuff and i never

1352
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:58,880
heard back so yeah

1353
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:00,480
we never they're like we didn't do that

1354
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:02,720
and we were like again pcap so yeah that

1355
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:05,119
was interesting so

1356
00:42:05,119 --> 00:42:07,520
this one is uh you know a corporate jira

1357
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:09,200
instance just public to the internet

1358
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:12,400
again uses http no tls just

1359
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:14,560
bam out there everything unique id and

1360
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:16,000
tokens are all on the clear you can grab

1361
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,200
that and get into it

1362
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:19,359
your jira is my jira and again this

1363
00:42:19,359 --> 00:42:20,480
could be reconnaissance you don't have

1364
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:21,359
to change anything

1365
00:42:21,359 --> 00:42:24,160
a couple more uh oh this one was this is

1366
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:25,119
this is the uh

1367
00:42:25,119 --> 00:42:27,040
singapore so basically long story short

1368
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:28,400
again we had malware

1369
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:31,599
that we thought hit registration um

1370
00:42:31,599 --> 00:42:34,880
it it got there but basically was not

1371
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:38,000
for what it was intended they were

1372
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,119
trying to run

1373
00:42:39,119 --> 00:42:41,920
uh pow powershell and invoke a few other

1374
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:42,800
things

1375
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:45,760
um which we didn't let them um but we

1376
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:47,520
were curious right like what

1377
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:50,240
it was so clearly like we mitigated what

1378
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:52,079
would have happened if this would

1379
00:42:52,079 --> 00:42:54,800
have gone and so we put it in you know a

1380
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:55,920
sandbox again

1381
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:57,839
and then we said let's see what it does

1382
00:42:57,839 --> 00:42:59,760
this is what it does

1383
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:02,800
sends pop3 spam monero crypto miner

1384
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:05,680
lateral port scanning connects to ten

1385
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:06,160
thousand

1386
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:07,599
external hosts basically scanned every

1387
00:43:07,599 --> 00:43:09,839
rfc

1388
00:43:09,839 --> 00:43:11,680
trying to dump creds and then did

1389
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:13,200
ransomware on top of it this

1390
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:15,440
was the noisiest most absurd piece of

1391
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:16,800
malware that we've ever seen

1392
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:19,040
and i was like if you don't get caught

1393
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:20,640
or if you don't catch this malware

1394
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:23,440
you deserve to be owned yes um and then

1395
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:24,800
finally

1396
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:26,960
um we love devices right we do actually

1397
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:28,800
see physical devices that get left

1398
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:29,839
around the space

1399
00:43:29,839 --> 00:43:31,839
um the device on the left is is one that

1400
00:43:31,839 --> 00:43:33,520
we've seen in vegas deployed

1401
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:35,440
in the past um and multiple of these

1402
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:36,800
devices get left around

1403
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:38,160
where somebody's basically just setting

1404
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:40,160
something up to de-off the wireless

1405
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:42,160
traffic we go around we find them and i

1406
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:43,599
know it only costs a couple bucks for

1407
00:43:43,599 --> 00:43:44,480
that but

1408
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:46,319
free hardware if it's free it's me i'm

1409
00:43:46,319 --> 00:43:47,920
going to take it it's ours

1410
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:49,920
and then but we think that that's

1411
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:52,319
adorable because you bring that

1412
00:43:52,319 --> 00:43:54,079
and what we bring is stuff like that on

1413
00:43:54,079 --> 00:43:55,359
the right did you explain what that is

1414
00:43:55,359 --> 00:43:57,359
really yeah that's uh that's the cactus

1415
00:43:57,359 --> 00:43:59,839
so the wi-fi cactus and our good buddy

1416
00:43:59,839 --> 00:44:01,440
dark matter that brings that i'm sure a

1417
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:02,800
lot of people know about the project but

1418
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:03,599
a whole bunch of

1419
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:06,880
uh wi-fi pineapples basically uh working

1420
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:07,359
together

1421
00:44:07,359 --> 00:44:10,000
to scan every channel all the time and

1422
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,319
see what you crazies are doing so yeah

1423
00:44:12,319 --> 00:44:14,240
it's uh so you bring your devices we

1424
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:15,520
bring our devices

1425
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:16,960
um and if you leave them around they're

1426
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:19,599
like was a 700 milliamp hour battery and

1427
00:44:19,599 --> 00:44:22,880
dark matter used to carry a car battery

1428
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:25,119
but that's it that's the uh the greatest

1429
00:44:25,119 --> 00:44:26,160
hits and holy

1430
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:28,240
