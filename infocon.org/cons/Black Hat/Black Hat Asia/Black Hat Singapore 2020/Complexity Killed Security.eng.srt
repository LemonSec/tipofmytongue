00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:14,559
welcome back to black hat

3
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:16,000
our program will commence shortly with

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,920
some opening remarks from jeff moss

5
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:19,760
followed by our keynote speaker daniel

6
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:22,560
gruss black hat would not be possible

7
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,640
without the support of so many people

8
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:26,400
especially this year as we've been all

9
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,720
been impacted by the global pandemic

10
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:30,720
and have had to rethink our entire event

11
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,960
in a virtual format

12
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:34,559
i would like to thank our sustaining

13
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:36,880
sponsors our global sponsors and of

14
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:38,320
course all of our black hat asia

15
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:40,640
sponsors for their ongoing support

16
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,079
i encourage you to connect with them in

17
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:44,000
the business hall and to explore the

18
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,320
many free resources they have provided

19
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:47,920
i encourage you to attend their sessions

20
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:50,239
which are open to all attendees

21
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:52,640
to our black hat review boards for

22
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:53,280
trainings

we thank you for your tireless efforts

26
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:00,800
in building the program for this week

27
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,320
thank you to all of our speakers for

28
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:03,920
their eagerness to embrace

29
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:06,960
the online format some housekeeping

30
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,799

black cat asia singapore first virtual

58
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,079
event

59
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:01,920
and it's my privilege to introduce the

60
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,240
day two keynote speaker

61
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,960
mr daniel grouse an assistant professor

62
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,479
at graz university

63
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:11,200
of technology who finished his phd in

64
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,480
only three years

65
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,160
he's been involved in teaching operating

66
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,959
system security to undergraduate courses

67
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:20,319
since 2010. most recently

68
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:22,319
daniel's work has gained international

69
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:23,520
attention

70
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,280
through his research focus on side

71
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:28,160
channels and transient execution attacks

72
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,280
he was involved in the team that

73
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,040
implemented the first remote fault

74
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:31,920
attack

75
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:34,400
running on a website now famously known

76
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,879
as rowhammer.js and his research

77
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:38,879
team was one that found the meltdown

78
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:40,640
inspector bugs published in

79
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:44,319
2018. these kinds of deep technical

80
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:44,879
faults

81
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:47,280
in the way that hardware operates as

82
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,720
fundamentally changing

83
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:52,560
the way that we view cpus remote hosting

84
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,280
and bare metal architectures and so i'm

85
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,400
really looking forward to

86
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,319
seeing what he has on the horizon and

87
00:02:58,319 --> 00:02:59,680
thoughts he has on

88
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,560
hardware security

89
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:06,000
hello and welcome to today's keynote i

90
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,040
will talk about

91
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:10,159
uh how complexity killed security uh my

92
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:11,680
name is daniel grouse i'm an assistant

93
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:12,400
professor

94
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,800
at class university of technology so

95
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,159
let's start with a simple

96
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:19,519
comic from xkcd so in this comic uh

97
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:21,599
you probably know this is your situation

98
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:22,640
are you coming to bed

99
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:25,280
i can't this is important what someone

100
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,120
is wrong on the internet

101
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,760
and i thought maybe we start with some

102
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,440
case like that

103
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:34,159
so this is a comic from xkcd as well the

104
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:35,760
meltdown inspector exploits use

105
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,120
speculative execution

106
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,599
what's that you know the trolley problem

107
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:40,400
well for

108
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,799
why now cpus have basically been sending

109
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:43,680
trolleys down

110
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:46,959
both passes quantum style while awaiting

111
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:49,360
your choice then the unneeded phantom

112
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,720
trolley disappears

113
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,400
if we take a look at how spectre

114
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,400
actually works you will see that the

115
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,560
processor just makes a prediction

116
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:59,519
as you can see here and then walks down

117
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:01,200
that path it doesn't walk

118
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,920
down both paths and then if the

119
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:06,000
speculation was incorrect of course

120
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,239
it will first walk the one way and then

121
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:09,680
walk the other way

122
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:12,840
um if it had to re-adapt this

123
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,000
speculation

124
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,040
okay so this is not actually fully

125
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,478
correct but let's take a

126
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:21,040
look at the second part uh the phantom

127
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:24,400
trolley isn't supposed to touch anyone

128
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:27,360
but it turns out you can still use it to

129
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,160
do stuff

130
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,160
and it can drive through walls also

131
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,639
there this is the reference to meltdown

132
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,560
meltdown and spectra are separated texts

133
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,240
but i will get to that also

134
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:39,840
later as well that sounds bad honestly

135
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:42,320
i've been assuming we were doomed since

136
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:45,600
we learned about row hammer so what's

137
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,080
that

138
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:49,759
well in row hammer you access rows

139
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:52,400
and if you access them often enough then

140
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,120
you will

141
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,759
find bit flips in the middle row so you

142
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:57,840
modify memory without actually

143
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,600
accessing these memory cells and you

144
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,280
don't have permission to access them

145
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,600
which allows you to implement very

146
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,720
interesting attacks

147
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:07,919
it sounds interesting to me

148
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:10,880
do we just suck at computers yeah

149
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,240
especially shared ones

150
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:15,120
so uh here's also my conclusion that i

151
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,320
want to start with

152
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:19,520
uh computers were a mistake uh

153
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:22,639
we are all doomed and we don't even know

154
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:24,720
what we are doing

155
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:27,280
so let's take a look at how we got there

156
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,720
and what the situation

157
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:32,240
actually is in this picture we see an

158
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,840
illustration of

159
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:36,400
the modern internet how it is connected

160
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,600
as a fully

161
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:40,960
connected graph of servers

162
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,880
the complexity of this is so enormous

163
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:45,280
that we are getting into a scale that is

164
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:48,800
almost of biological measures um

165
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:52,479
if we take a look at this

166
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:55,840
comic again if we software

167
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:58,080
developers but also hardware developers

168
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,520
were

169
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:02,080
architects probably we would try to

170
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:02,560
build

171
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:05,759
buildings like this

172
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:07,520
the thing is we are putting layers on

173
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:09,680
top of layers on top of layers that

174
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,280
depend on each other

175
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,960
and that make assumptions about each

176
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:15,360
other but it's not really clear whether

177
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,440
these assumptions always hold

178
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:19,520
you probably will also know and you will

179
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:20,960
probably have experienced

180
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:24,400
this how complexity exceeds our

181
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:27,440
uh thought capacity very quickly and

182
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:28,960
very easily

183
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:31,600
my code doesn't work i have no idea why

184
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,919
and vice versa my code works i have no

185
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:35,199
idea why

186
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:37,759
and it takes us quite some time until we

187
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:38,800
understand

188
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:42,240
why the code works so it's very easy to

189
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,840
build complex things

190
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:46,880
that at first are very difficult for us

191
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:49,680
to understand ourselves

192
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:52,560
let's take a look at one example so this

193
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,080
is a dram module

194
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,840
and these dram modules they have these

195
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,440
chips banks

196
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:00,479
rows they have channels

197
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:03,520
ranks and if you uh take a look at

198
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,919
how this mapping works from physical

199
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:06,800
addresses

200
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,840
to the actual hardware cells

201
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:12,560
that's not documented right it's not

202
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:13,120
public

203
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:16,080
but we reverse engineered that and that

204
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:16,560
was

205
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:19,520
uh four years ago and we resolved these

206
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:20,240
functions for

207
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,160
several different machines how did we do

208
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,360
that we used

209
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:26,560
side channels in a side channel

210
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,800
for instance in this example uh you

211
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,479
probably have seen that in the movies

212
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:33,039
you have this safe and when the ledge

213
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:34,639
snaps and you hear this

214
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:36,960
snapping noise and you can hear that

215
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,639
with a stethoscope and then you know

216
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:40,080
that you have to turn the wheel the

217
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,120
other direction

218
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:44,319
and you know how to open

219
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:46,960
the safe so what is a site channel i

220
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,560
would say the site channel is

221
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:51,680
obtaining metadata and deriving

222
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:55,199
secrets from it and maybe some people

223
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:56,639
don't agree with that but this is the

224
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:58,479
definition that i can work with

225
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:00,639
and in this case in the case of drama we

226
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:02,000
also used

227
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,720
a side channel the timing side channel

228
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:05,520
so we use

229
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,759
row hits and row misses because if you

230
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:09,280
access dram cells

231
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,520
some of them will be cached in the row

232
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,680
buffer and others are not and you can

233
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:14,400
see that

234
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:17,919
this timing difference here rohit romis

235
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:21,039
and uh that's basically we apply uh

236
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:23,919
methods from natural sciences right we

237
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:24,639
measure

238
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:26,800
uh whether it's faster or slower and

239
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:29,120
infer something from that

240
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:32,958
and many people say well that's not

241
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:35,360
really science because if you take a

242
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,279
look at how computer science should work

243
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:37,760
or

244
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,599
where computer science is you can see

245
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:41,440
here the branches of science and you can

246
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:41,919
see

247
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:43,839
basic and applied you can see natural

248
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:45,360
sciences social sciences

249
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,360
formal sciences and here we have

250
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,600
computer science

251
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,760
wait a second computer science is a

252
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:54,720
formal applied science

253
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:57,120
also this guy here computer science is

254
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,800
just applied mathematics

255
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,680
well i'm not entirely sure about that

256
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:02,640
but applied

257
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,800
mathematics so maybe let's take a look

258
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:07,600
at a actual computer

259
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:10,240
and let's do some applied computations

260
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:13,200
so oh we can type a number here

261
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:16,560
yes maybe this number oh

262
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,399
if we turn this around this is from the

263
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:20,320
other side this is hello

264
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:24,480
this reminds me of something hello

265
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:27,850
[Music]

266
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:33,839
i don't even need network right

267
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:37,760
your cash noise pattern it clearly

268
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:41,230
doesn't save your vm anymore

269
00:09:41,230 --> 00:09:44,359
[Music]

270
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,240
wait a second wait a second they talked

271
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,680
about noise

272
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,839
we are talking here about computers

273
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:53,440
applied formal science

274
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,600
this should be a fully deterministic

275
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,120
system right

276
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:00,080
so why do we have noise this is from our

277
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,920
hello from the other side paper and you

278
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:02,880
can clearly see

279
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,600
that we observe noise how can that be in

280
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:05,920
a

281
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:08,720
fully deterministic system the thing is

282
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:09,200
there

283
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:12,640
is no noise noise is just variables

284
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:16,480
unaccounted for so this means

285
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,959
we are we are not in a noisy system at

286
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:21,120
all but if we go back to these uh

287
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,120
questions like is computer science just

288
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,399
mathematics uh

289
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:27,360
i would say i would go a step further

290
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:30,959
math is just applied velocity

291
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:32,480
well if computer science is just

292
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,240
mathematics then probably this is also

293
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,079
right but this leads us to a very

294
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:37,279
interesting question

295
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:40,320
uh that i've been wondering about with

296
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,000
endless computation

297
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,640
power and knowledge of the entire state

298
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:45,760
of the universe

299
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:49,680
i think one could predict the future

300
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:53,200
maybe it's not possible that's right but

301
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,880
the thing is we have to

302
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,959
uh we have to accept that we build

303
00:10:56,959 --> 00:10:58,640
systems that are so complex

304
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:01,200
that we are analyzing them with natural

305
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,240
science methods

306
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:05,760
because computer science building things

307
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:09,120
exceeds what we can analyze with

308
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:12,560
just formal methods in this case

309
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:15,839
we also we probe the dram bus

310
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:19,360
and inferred what the actual mappings

311
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:23,040
are in another case

312
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:26,320
we looked at address translation so in

313
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,279
this

314
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:30,480
case we look at x86 64

315
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:33,519
and we wanted to know whether the dress

316
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:35,519
translation which has multiple layers

317
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:37,680
will take a different amount of time

318
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,040
depending on

319
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:41,440
where the translation stops for instance

320
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,200
if you have a two megabyte page it would

321
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,720
already stop on this level

322
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:47,360
and directly map a page or for a four

323
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,959
kilobyte page it would stop on this

324
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:49,519
level

325
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:51,920
and directly provide a four kilobyte

326
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:52,639
page

327
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:54,160
and if you look at the timing

328
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,320
differences you can see

329
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,160
where for instance if you run this on

330
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,240
the kernel addresses

331
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,320
where the kernel addresses are mapped

332
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,680
because the other parts

333
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:06,639
they stop at a higher timing for

334
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:08,839
instance because the pages are not valid

335
00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:10,160
there

336
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:12,959
and this is again uh science right we

337
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:14,880
reverse engineered

338
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:17,839
how this mapping works and you might

339
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:18,320
wonder

340
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,800
well why don't you this is stupid humans

341
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,560
build it so this must be documented

342
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:23,200
somewhere

343
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,639
so why don't you just read the

344
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:27,120
documentation right

345
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,839
and the next step is well of course this

346
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:31,760
is not documented because it's not open

347
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:32,399
source

348
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:35,360
so the question is would open solve the

349
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:35,920
problem

350
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:38,800
is risk five going to save the day and

351
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,560
the question that i want to ask you here

352
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:40,959
is

353
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:43,760
did open source software save the day it

354
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:44,320
didn't

355
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,600
we see the same number of

356
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,360
vulnerabilities in closed

357
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:50,639
software and in open source software

358
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:53,200
the thing is there are some advantages

359
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,800
to open source software for instance

360
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:55,360
that

361
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,360
it's usually a shorter amount of time

362
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,360
until a bug is patched

363
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:02,480
um you also have

364
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,639
probably a larger community that looks

365
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:06,399
at the software but you also have other

366
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:08,399
disadvantages for instance as we have

367
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:10,240
seen around meltdown inspector

368
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:13,120
that it's very difficult to patch very

369
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,079
uh

370
00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:17,279
critical bugs out in the open so there

371
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:18,240
are advantages

372
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:22,000
and disadvantages and i think

373
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,680
i don't have a clear answer to that in

374
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,600
terms of security

375
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:29,120
there's no clear benefit other than

376
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:32,959
the reduced time to patch

377
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:35,279
let's take another look uh at one

378
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:36,000
example

379
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
uh because if you would say well open

380
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,360
source isn't going to help

381
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,600
why don't we just make everything closed

382
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:42,399
source

383
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:45,199
and just hide all the ugly security

384
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:46,399
hacks that we had

385
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:49,440
for instance let's go for up security by

386
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:50,560
obscurity

387
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:52,800
and i have one example here this is the

388
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:53,760
msr

389
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:58,000
0x 150 and you can use this to

390
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,920
select the voltage as we did in the

391
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,920
plundervolt attack

392
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:04,160
and here you can see that you can select

393
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:06,320
via this msr you can select the plane

394
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,680
index and the offset

395
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:10,399
and change the voltage of the cpu by

396
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:10,800
that

397
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:13,279
this is um yeah is this security

398
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:14,079
critical

399
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:16,320
is this security biosecurity let's take

400
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,320
a look at this simple code here

401
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:21,440
on an endless loop uh this should never

402
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,120
terminate because it computes the same

403
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,560
number over and over again

404
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:26,399
and it should never go into this line

405
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:28,399
but if we take a look at this

406
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:32,880
um when we run this code

407
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,199
here you can see we are undervolting

408
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:39,279
this now and as we go down with the

409
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:39,839
voltage

410
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:42,560
we see that a fault occurs and this

411
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:44,000
fault

412
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,160
then can be exploited again similar as

413
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:48,320
in the rohamer attack

414
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,959
so the question is of course if we are a

415
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:52,399
formal science if we

416
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:55,600
are part of mathematics can we just be

417
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:58,639
provably secure systems and a question

418
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:00,320
that i want to ask you there is

419
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:03,199
what properties before the internet came

420
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:03,600
up

421
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:06,160
the properties that we wanted to have in

422
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,440
a secure system

423
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,440
were different than the properties that

424
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,279
we want in them today

425
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:14,399
today we have these channels where um

426
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:16,720
criminals can send money over the

427
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:17,440
internet

428
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:20,480
we have things like ransomware coming up

429
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,639
that without the internet wouldn't

430
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:26,320
flourish as much as they do

431
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:29,279
the internet radically changed what

432
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:30,399
security

433
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:33,360
properties we want in a system but this

434
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:34,160
also exists

435
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:36,480
on a much smaller scale with all the

436
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,720
single new discoveries that we make

437
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,800
for instance when we discover a draw

438
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:41,920
hammer

439
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:44,800
we saw this patch in the linux kernel do

440
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:45,680
not disclose

441
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:49,120
physical addresses because of row hammer

442
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:52,399
the problem here is that no one would

443
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:54,560
have foreseen that suddenly

444
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,880
physical addresses would be considered a

445
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:57,600
secret

446
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:01,279
so why would your formal system try to

447
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:03,600
keep this a secret if we don't even

448
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:06,079
understand that this must be kept secret

449
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:08,800
for another attack that was not even

450
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,480
known at that point

451
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,560
so the required security properties

452
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:15,600
change over time

453
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,440
if we take a look at the complexity of

454
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:20,160
systems the complexity of systems

455
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:22,480
is composed of the complexity of the

456
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,560
subsystems that we have in there so if

457
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:26,079
we have this larger system

458
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:28,720
which is composed of three systems then

459
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:29,920
the complexity

460
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:32,800
is at least as much as the complexity of

461
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:33,600
the smaller

462
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:36,079
subsystems but we have not taken into

463
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:37,680
account that we also have a system

464
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:38,959
interaction here

465
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:41,759
that adds additional complexity so even

466
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:44,320
if each of these systems by itself

467
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,240
has a complexity where we can say we can

468
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:48,399
make a formal proof we can

469
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:50,560
reason about this system and argue why

470
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:51,519
it is secure

471
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:53,360
as soon as we put multiple systems

472
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:55,680
together new effects occur

473
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:58,959
that maybe are not covered by our

474
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:01,920
security proofs so if we take a look at

475
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:02,240
uh

476
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:05,599
for example this case here we have a

477
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:08,400
user we have an execution unit in a

478
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,919
processor and the user says

479
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:13,199
i request or load data and the execution

480
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:14,640
unit will then in the second step

481
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:17,280
check the privileges and then kill the

482
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:19,839
user process or kill the threat

483
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:23,439
if no privileges or if the user doesn't

484
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:24,160
have enough

485
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:26,480
privileges this is one system one

486
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:27,599
interaction between

487
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:30,320
two components this is one system

488
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:32,880
another system is this system here to

489
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:33,919
obtain data

490
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:36,160
so we have the user on the one side that

491
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,200
sends the request

492
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,960
and the execution unit because it

493
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,799
doesn't have the data itself

494
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:43,280
will just send the request on to the

495
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:44,240
cache and says

496
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:46,480
send the data to the requesting load so

497
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,000
send the data to the user

498
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,160
and the cache will send this data to the

499
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,440
user so

500
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:54,960
both uh circuits both um

501
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:58,160
both cases both systems by itself are

502
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,840
secure the right thing happens

503
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:02,160
but if you combine them you will see

504
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:04,000
that you have a race condition

505
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,480
in the third step because the kill might

506
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,880
occur just after the data was already

507
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:09,679
received

508
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:12,480
by the spy so the question then is of

509
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:14,400
course if we are building so complex

510
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,480
systems that they have bugs like

511
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:19,280
meltdown is the solution maybe that we

512
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:20,480
go back to more

513
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:24,160
simple systems less complex systems

514
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:27,679
and in general i would say yes to some

515
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:29,200
extent we can

516
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:31,840
we have been doing that for instance the

517
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:32,960
pentium 4

518
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:36,000
was arguably a more complex design than

519
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:36,880
the later

520
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:40,559
core processors that went back to the

521
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:43,520
pentium 3 design as a basis

522
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:45,520
so now what we are doing there is we are

523
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:47,440
combining more and more of these less

524
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:48,160
complex

525
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:51,200
designs into larger and larger

526
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:53,360
processors larger and larger systems

527
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:55,280
and we at the same time make them

528
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:56,640
smaller and smaller

529
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,960
which allows us to run these older less

530
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:00,240
complex systems

531
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:03,600
at a higher frequency at a higher speed

532
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:06,480
so moore's law promises us that we can

533
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,559
actually do that that we can

534
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:11,840
take simple cores and put them together

535
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:15,600
into a system with multiple cores

536
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:18,080
and each of these simple cores will run

537
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:20,000
faster and faster and faster because we

538
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,280
can

539
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:24,400
put more transistors into small amount

540
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,039
of space

541
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:28,480
we can run them at a lower energy

542
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:31,039
level and we can run them at a higher

543
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:33,679
frequency

544
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:36,559
the problem now with moore's law is it's

545
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:37,520
any

546
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:40,000
it's basically we are very close to the

547
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,039
end um

548
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:44,240
and the problem is that if we take a

549
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:44,720
look at

550
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:47,360
our computation demands i didn't find a

551
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:49,600
plot for the computation demands of our

552
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:50,480
entire

553
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:53,440
uh population but i found an energy

554
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:54,400
forecast of

555
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,720
our computer systems and here you can

556
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:57,760
see that

557
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:01,600
the s current estimate is that by 2030

558
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:05,679
around 21 of electricity that we produce

559
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:08,960
will be consumed by our computer systems

560
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,960
and this of course is a problem this

561
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,799
directly is correlated

562
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:16,400
to the computation needs that we have

563
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:18,640
but if moore's law is ending and at the

564
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:20,159
same time we have a strong

565
00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:23,520
increase in the computation demands

566
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:26,640
of our society then the question is

567
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,960
how can we how does that fit together

568
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,159
how can we

569
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:34,000
then still meet our computation demands

570
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,720
and the solution that i want to bring up

571
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:37,520
here

572
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:42,159
is that well in 1999 we said

573
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:45,520
oh i developed one piece of software in

574
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:47,760
only 120 lines of code and it's not so

575
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:48,000
much

576
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,840
about the lines of code that you write

577
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:51,200
but the lines of code

578
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:56,159
that are involved in solving the problem

579
00:20:56,159 --> 00:20:59,360
if you would take a look at the early 3d

580
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:00,240
games or

581
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:03,200
maybe also consoles they were heavily

582
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,000
optimized

583
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,159
for size and performance so that they

584
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:08,480
can run on the constrained devices that

585
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:08,960
they had

586
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:12,000
at the time by now the systems uh due to

587
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,280
moore's law

588
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:15,120
scaled so much up that it doesn't matter

589
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:17,039
this much so we now can write many

590
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:17,520
things

591
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:21,520
in a much more wasteful manner

592
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:24,480
but what i would predict in 2029 we

593
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,480
might head back the other direction

594
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:30,799
and start optimizing again for low level

595
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:33,919
performance for assembly for c

596
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:35,919
because higher level languages might be

597
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:37,120
too slow

598
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:40,240
or too energy consuming so what we will

599
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:42,159
have here because of course writing low

600
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:43,600
level code will have

601
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:46,640
more complex problems synchronization

602
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:49,919
problems interaction with the low level

603
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:53,200
parts the operating system the hardware

604
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:56,000
so yes we will have more software

605
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,039
complexity

606
00:21:57,039 --> 00:22:01,440
of one kind also if you take a look at

607
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:03,679
the hardware complexity if moore's law

608
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:04,480
is ending

609
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:07,440
then i would expect that we have also a

610
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:08,559
slowdown

611
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:11,600
in the performance

612
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,760
of modern processors but if you take a

613
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,120
look at for instance

614
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:18,080
the cpu benchmarks you see that the

615
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:20,400
benchmark scores are actually

616
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:24,720
increasing a bit above linear

617
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:27,679
the question is how is that possible if

618
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:29,520
moore's law is ending because

619
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:31,840
this shouldn't happen right it should

620
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:33,039
slow down

621
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:35,480
the thing is we are adding more and more

622
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:38,000
optimizations on the microarchitectural

623
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,280
level

624
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:42,240
and adding more optimizations on the

625
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:44,159
micro architectural level

626
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:46,799
means more hardware complexity more

627
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:48,240
clever hardware

628
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:50,880
more instruction set extensions and that

629
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:51,840
means again

630
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:54,159
more potential for problems we are

631
00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:55,520
combining more and more

632
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:58,960
systems into single systems that

633
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:02,159
are more difficult to understand so if

634
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:04,400
we take a look at the complexity of

635
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,559
modern software or hardware

636
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:09,679
you can see that the software complexity

637
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:13,679
is almost reaching the level of

638
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:16,799
pretty complex biological organisms

639
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:19,919
the dna sequence the genome

640
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:23,360
of a mouse for instance so our systems

641
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:23,919
that we

642
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:27,120
as humans build are getting so complex

643
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:30,320
getting as complex as nature itself

644
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:33,600
and there um i want to bring up this

645
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:34,240
book

646
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:36,320
by herbert simon the sciences of the

647
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:37,760
artificial because

648
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:41,039
it is not a natural science to study

649
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:43,840
how a computer works because a computer

650
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:45,600
is something artificial it's something

651
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,200
that we humans build

652
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:50,080
but we have to study it like nature

653
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:52,240
because it exceeded the complexity

654
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:55,120
that we can reason about in another way

655
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:56,720
so we have to study it

656
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:59,440
like nature and that means we have to go

657
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:01,039
through the regular natural science

658
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:01,919
methodology

659
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:05,440
with question hypothesis prediction

660
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:07,600
then testing whether our prediction

661
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:08,559
holds

662
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:11,760
and then the analysis of the

663
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,840
results and then of course we also need

664
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:14,880
to compare it

665
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:17,360
with previous work with related work to

666
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:18,000
see whether

667
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,120
our hypothesis makes sense and whether

668
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:23,919
our hypothesis might be correct this is

669
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:25,360
how our science work

670
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:27,440
and our artificial science where we

671
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:28,799
study computers

672
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:32,400
works in the same way now

673
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:35,919
what is the conclusion here our systems

674
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:38,320
are getting more and more complex

675
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:41,679
and that means that we will have to

676
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:44,400
invest more and more time into studying

677
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:44,960
them

678
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:48,480
like nature in 30 years i would expect

679
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:50,880
that we have a significantly larger

680
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:52,159
number of people

681
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:55,679
studying the security and analyzing the

682
00:24:55,679 --> 00:24:56,799
security

683
00:24:56,799 --> 00:24:59,679
of our systems than we have today and if

684
00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:00,080
you

685
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:04,000
take a look back on 20 years ago

686
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,279
30 years ago the job of pentester didn't

687
00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:08,559
really exist

688
00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:10,640
so we have more and more security

689
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:12,240
analysts and we will

690
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:14,799
see more and more variety in the jobs

691
00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:15,679
that need to be

692
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:18,480
performed there so the takeaways are the

693
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:20,159
complexity of hardware and software

694
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:20,799
systems

695
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:23,679
continues to increase this does not stop

696
00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:24,880
and it cannot stop

697
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:26,880
because we have our computational

698
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,880
demands and at the same time

699
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:31,919
moore's law that is ending

700
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:34,720
we need natural science methods and

701
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,240
significant efforts

702
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:39,039
to understand systems and their

703
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:42,720
complexity and their security

704
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:46,400
and the last aspect that i want to give

705
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:47,120
you

706
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:50,080
is the perspective on security might

707
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:51,760
change over time we have seen that in

708
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:52,400
the beginning

709
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,640
the internet changed the perspective on

710
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:56,159
security but also

711
00:25:56,159 --> 00:25:58,559
for very very concrete attacks for

712
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:00,320
instance for the meltdown attack

713
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:02,799
we thought the meltdown attack that's it

714
00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:03,760
it's solved

715
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:06,720
but only recently we figured out that we

716
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:07,840
can also

717
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:10,559
turn this around in a way and do

718
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:11,360
something else

719
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:14,320
and with that i will show you one last

720
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:15,840
example is there a way we can do

721
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,919
something like that

722
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:21,520
by injection inside or

723
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:25,840
or and it turns out that the idea to do

724
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:27,200
something with injection

725
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:30,240
is not so bad so here's our trailer

726
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:32,799
if you haven't seen it yet for load

727
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:35,200
value injection

728
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:36,559
there's one thing you should know about

729
00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:38,640
me i specialize in a

730
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:42,000
very specific type of security micro

731
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,840
architectural security

732
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:47,039
you're talking about meltdown

733
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:50,880
mr van burk has an idea he would like to

734
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:52,080
discuss with you

735
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:55,120
spreading meltdown

736
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:00,799
not exactly we turn meltdown around

737
00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:03,039
you bring the subject into a fault and

738
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:06,480
then they fill it with their secrets

739
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:09,279
then you break it and leak it well it's

740
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:09,679
not

741
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:12,960
strictly speaking leaky

742
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:17,919
it's called load value injection

743
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:22,720
i think you overlooked one square and

744
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:24,799
this last square

745
00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:27,600
that's lvi

746
00:27:28,399 --> 00:27:30,240
we mustn't be afraid where the female

747
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:35,840
fans is darling

748
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:39,440
thank you for your attention uh now i

749
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:41,120
will be available for the q

750
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:42,880
a and i'm looking forward to any

751
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:44,559
discussions on this topic

752
00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:48,510
so see you in the q a in a second

753
00:27:48,510 --> 00:28:00,710
[Applause]
