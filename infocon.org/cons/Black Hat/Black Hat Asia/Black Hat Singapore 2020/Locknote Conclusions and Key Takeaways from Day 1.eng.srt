working for google threat analysis group

48
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:45,840
as a security researcher

49
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,799
a security engineer story um but because

50
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:50,880
of kovi i'm actually working remotely in

51
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:51,920
taiwan now

52
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,640

54
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:01,840
i served in the review board since 2016

55
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:04,000
and i'm really happy to serve in the

56

board till now

57
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,160
thanks everyone we were making a joke at

58
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,080
the start that normally

59
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,360
because we're all virtual we're used to

60
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,200
sort of being up on stage and grabbing a

61
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,560
beer so it sort of

62
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,239
helps us to relax a little bit so we're

63
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:17,599
going to pretend we've all got a beer in

64
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:18,480
hand and

65
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:21,440
and just having a bit of a laugh but um

66
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,640
i'm going to be moderating today's

67
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:23,680
session so i've got a couple of

68
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:24,640
questions but

69
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:27,440
um feel free to enter any of your

70
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,800
burning questions for us

71
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,519
in the um in the questions in the

72
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:32,319
questions box

73
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:33,840
and i'll do my best to read them out as

74
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,680
we all talk about things

75
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:38,319
um we saw some really interesting talks

76
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:40,560
today i mean we had a great keynote

77
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:43,280
from goroth keithy and he was discussing

78
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,040
obviously the differences with

79
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,720
cyber security as it relates to the

80
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:49,680
government and also how that translates

81
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:50,239
to

82
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:53,519
uh to the to the private sector um

83
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:56,080
we saw some great talks as well you know

84
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:59,200
wi-fi vulnerabilities uh spy cameras in

85
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,200
in the asia-pac region and how that's

86
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,760
affecting some of us

87
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,680
let's let's start with you ryan what was

88
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,760
maybe one of the highlighted talks or

89
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:10,159
briefings that you saw today

90
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:12,959
yeah so um for me the one of the

91
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:13,599
highlight

92
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:16,800
talks is the contactless payment

93
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,040
and um because i believe that this is

94
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,800
going to be a critical

95
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,440
um you know one of the critical things

96
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,480
moving forward

97
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,239
with regards to the current situation

98
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:27,599
that we are now in

99
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:30,640
so a lot of retailers at least for

100
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,480
example here in singapore

101
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:35,040
and i know also in the southeast asia or

102
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,239
apac region

103
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:38,319
they are preparing contactless payments

104
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:40,080
because um you know

105
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,080
you you you cough on your hand you you

106
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,000
touch your on the paper bill and then

107
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
you hand it over it can be a medium for

108
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,840
transmission for the growing virus

109
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,640
so contactless payment um has been

110
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:51,360
picking up

111
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:54,400
steam um rapidly and

112
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,799
knowing that you know there's a lot of

113
00:03:56,799 --> 00:03:58,879
systemic vulnerabilities in the

114
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:00,879
ecosystem of the contactless payment

115
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:01,439
system

116
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:04,239
it's um it's a very good thing to know

117
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:04,720
and

118
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:07,120
also somehow very disheartening because

119
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,360
um you know a security weakness here a

120
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,480
security weakness

121
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:13,120
there on someone else says that it's not

122
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,080
their problem

123
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,959
and you know things don't get fixed so

124
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:18,478
probably that's the

125
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:21,918
uh major um talk that i was um

126
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:24,320
you know interested in and learned a lot

127
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,320
from earlier

128
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,080
thanks ryan what about you ashley what

129
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,360
was something what was the highlight for

130
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,280
you today

131
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,840
yeah there are a lot of talks that i

132
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:34,479
like and

133
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:37,120
it's actually hard to pick just one um

134
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,720
but i really like the keynote

135
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:41,600
given by graph i like the perspective of

136
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,000
looking

137
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,440
at the problem as public and private

138
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,199
the perspective from the governments are

139
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:49,360
definitely uh pretty different from

140
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,919
private sectors for example as private

141
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:52,880
sector we

142
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,880
sometimes plan users for not having

143
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:57,520
enough awareness of the security issues

144
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:00,240
um the government has the responsibility

145
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,759
to raise the awareness

146
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:04,479
so i was i was impressed by the ideas of

147
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:04,800
the

148
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,039
labeling scheme because it's trying to

149
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:08,960
solve the problem from the perspective

150
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:09,520
of

151
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:12,160
the whole supply chain and the markets

152
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:12,560
uh

153
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:15,759
ecosystems so consumers should have the

154
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:16,800
power to

155
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,360
request vendors for security design and

156
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,160
i'm really

157
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:23,440
looking forward to see how it will be

158
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,520
implemented and how the markets will

159
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:26,880
react to it

160
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:29,600
and i also like the food nutrition

161
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,680
analogy and then i would like to see

162
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,560
more countries uh start to join the teen

163
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,639
sport

164
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:40,639
thanks ashley what about you um ty

165
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:44,000
uh so look you typically find that

166
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,840
you know a lot of the attendees either

167
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,840
fall into the category of

168
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,680
low-level talks where they like the

169
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:52,160
detail or the high level talks where

170
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,440
they just get the

171
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:56,400
like the concepts um i tend to find

172
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,360
myself

173
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:00,319
a bit of an anomaly in that case where

174
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:01,280
you know being a

175
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:03,280
the trainer of the shell code for the

176
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,759
last 10 years i really love the

177
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:06,639
low-level

178
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:09,840
attacks um but then on the other side

179
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:12,639
being the ceo and sort of visionary for

180
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:13,919
our platform

181
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:15,759
you know i really love sort of seeing

182
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:17,440
the forecast for the

183
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:21,600
future and how you know different

184
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,520
uh attacks and vulnerabilities are going

185
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:26,240
to arise and forecasting the state of

186
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,319
the internet moving forward

187
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:30,479
um and predicting you know some of the

188
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:32,000
security that we're going to

189
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,960
see coming down the line so yeah i tend

190
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,400
to agree i liked the

191
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:39,280
uh from the high level talks i really

192
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,160
liked the

193
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:43,199
keynote um where uh

194
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:46,319
the the comparison between um water

195
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:48,479
sanitation with cyber

196
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:51,520
uh where the old days you know we um

197
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,360
we're told that we're not allowed we

198
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,440
shouldn't drink the dirty water that it

199
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,280
wasn't enforced on us

200
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:00,160
um and you know people still drink their

201
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:00,960
dirty water

202
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:03,280
right and comparing that to cyber where

203
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,960
we're currently saying to people

204
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:07,199
don't drink the dirty cyber and we know

205
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:08,880
that everyone is still going to drink

206
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,560
the dirty cyber

207
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,240
so i thought that was really interesting

208
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,240
and therefore you know we need to make

209
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,400
sure that we shift our approach

210
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:19,840
into a strategic one i think that

211
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,599
one of the challenges that i see with a

212
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:24,160
lot of the government initiatives

213
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:27,199
is that they are very strategic

214
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:30,240
and they take a long time to deliver

215
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,880
the challenge that we've got is that uh

216
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,479
we're in a

217
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:37,759
landscape where you know in cyber we're

218
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:39,280
talking about a change

219
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:42,479
in the in time frames of minutes or

220
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:46,080
hours where one minute you're safe

221
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,840
the next minute you're completely

222
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,280
vulnerable and you could

223
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:51,680
could have stopped the security breach

224
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:52,720
on the on the

225
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:55,440
other side of that talk there was a

226
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,479
comparison with

227
00:07:56,479 --> 00:08:00,800
car safety where you know drivers don't

228
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,879
need to know how a car works they just

229
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:04,479
want to know that it's safe

230
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:06,560
right um but that's that's really

231
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,160
different um to

232
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,840
cyber where you know you're comparing

233
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:12,639
against a

234
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:16,319
car on a stable road it's a known entity

235
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:18,479
and it's going across something that's

236
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:19,520
safe

237
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:22,400
when you put that into the context of

238
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,720
cyberload it's more like

239
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,400
i sort of compare it against like the

240
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,400
matrix where you've got those

241
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,639
transparent bad guys where they're

242
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:32,479
driving along the freeway

243
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:34,640
and suddenly drivers are turning into

244
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,559
bad guys trying to run you off the road

245
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:38,000
and those sort of things so

246
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
it's a little bit different but um you

247
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,679
know i think it was a really good

248
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:42,880
comparison

249
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:45,839
um from that low level side uh i really

250
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:46,320
liked

251
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,600
that their hardware-based

252
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,279
vulnerabilities so the page cache

253
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:49,920
attacks

254
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:53,200
were really stood out for me and um

255
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,800
especially applying some of those

256
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,399
hardware vulnerabilities

257
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:59,040
into a different concept for operating

258
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,519
systems really sort of shows

259
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:05,519
uh just the the extensiveness of attacks

260
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:07,519
that are out there and they're going to

261
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:11,040
keep coming down the line moving forward

262
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,720
thanks ty i think that we had some

263
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,720
really some really interesting sessions

264
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:15,600
today and i think

265
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,440
um you know for those that might have

266
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,519
missed any any sessions today they are

267
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:21,200
available for you to go back and watch

268
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:21,600
and

269
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,120
and take another look especially if

270
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,720
maybe there's one that we discussed

271
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,560
now that you didn't get an opportunity

272
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,880
to see um

273
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,800
i think i'm still there's just just

274
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,080
checking if there's any questions so

275
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,040
don't forget to

276
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,399
send your questions through if there's

277
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:35,920
any particular topics that you'd like us

278
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:36,560
to

279
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,959
discuss but i think just moving on from

280
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:40,320
the briefings today

281
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,600
you know to some degree and we're

282
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,200
probably all sick and tired of talking

283
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,440
about the impact of covert

284
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:47,519
um so definitely take a sip of that beer

285
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:48,480
but um

286
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,080
i think in the last six months it's

287
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,320
definitely impacted many of us not just

288
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,839
personally but professionally whether

289
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:55,120
you're working from home

290
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:58,959
or um you know that remote setup or even

291
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:00,959
even things from privacy issues of

292
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:02,240
tracking apps or

293
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:05,120
companies try to try to onboard that vpn

294
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:07,440
those vpn systems quickly because

295
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,200
you know we're used to a small set of

296
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,720
users working from home and all of a

297
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,000
sudden

298
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,959
you've got you know 20 20 20 30 000

299
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:16,399
people that need to work from home and

300
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:18,399
the vpns are under pressure so

301
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:19,760
i mean i think i'd just like to explore

302
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,040
that topic a little bit i mean i know

303
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:22,240
personally i've been affected

304
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:25,200
with it in my day-to-day um work um how

305
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,240
has it sort of affected

306
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:28,560
some of some of you in your day-to-day

307
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,320
and what are you seeing companies

308
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,920
doing to sort of overcome some of these

309
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:34,399
barriers um actually i might start with

310
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:36,480
you if that's okay

311
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:39,920
yeah sure so i believe kobe had

312
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:42,079
a lot of impacts to everyone's life

313
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:44,000
actually for me personally it was

314
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
pretty bad because i was actually just

315
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,240
relocate to a new country and then

316
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,200
suddenly

317
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:52,240
um like all the store closed and then i

318
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,600
was independent

319
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:56,320
i was like isolated and for for one

320
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,600
month and it was

321
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:00,399
pretty bad um but also from the cyber

322
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:02,560
perspective over the past few months we

323
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:03,200
have

324
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,920
also seen a lot of attackers both

325
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:07,920
financially motivated and nation state

326
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,040
attackers

327
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:11,760
they use kobe related things to create

328
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:12,320
some

329
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,720
urgency so people respond to phishing

330
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:15,440
attacks

331
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:19,600
and scams um and they often impersonate

332
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:22,079
impersonating the health organizations

333
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:23,200
charities

334
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:26,640
or some ngos to um targets the

335
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:29,440
user um to lure them into downloading

336
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,000
some

337
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,200
malicious link malicious malware and

338
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,839
we have also seen nations they use this

339
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:36,560
to target

340
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:39,600
governments and also increase number

341
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,800
of health organizations public health

342
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:46,079
agency um and the individuals there

343
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:49,200
um like working in the health industry

344
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:52,240
so yeah like i think it's definitely a

345
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,519
change in the

346
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:58,000
cyber's perspective uh i i think we will

347
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,240
we were definitely going to see more

348
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,279
companies

349
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:03,680
um being flexible on the work from home

350
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:04,639
policy and i

351
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:06,720
i believe this is good because people

352
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,320
are diverse it's always

353
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,720
good for people to have more options to

354
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:11,600
choose their

355
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,680
working environment but of course at the

356
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:15,600
same time we will

357
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,600
face a lot of challenge in terms of

358
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:18,800
security

359
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:21,680
um because the hackers often see crisis

360
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:23,600
as a great opportunity

361
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:26,160
um because of many reasons um because

362
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,160
people are more emotional

363
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,839
um they are worried for health and

364
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:31,360
safety um

365
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,600
and also like like you mentioned that

366
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:34,560
cooperates

367
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,880
uh that probably did not set up the

368
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:39,360
remote environments are now forced and

369
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:42,639
rushed into it and without carefully

370
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:44,959
assessing the security risk

371
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:48,560
um and evaluating how the new solutions

372
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:51,200
fits into the current infrastructure

373
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,920
many of them also don't have a instant

374
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:56,399
management process for this environment

375
00:12:56,399 --> 00:13:00,000
so i believe this shows a search of a

376
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,519
security risk and also the equipment is

377
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:05,519
also a risk that

378
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:07,279
during remote work there might be

379
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:10,160
increased personal use of company device

380
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:10,560
that

381
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:13,040
bad user personal behavior might lead to

382
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:14,480
the company's breach

383
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,800
also location is actually another

384
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:17,920
challenge because

385
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:20,480
it's hard to control where people work

386
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:21,279
remotely

387
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:23,839
and it's often that employee is

388
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:24,800
surrounded by

389
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:27,440
family friends or children or even just

390
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,200
stranger in the cafe

391
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:32,480
um so without a strict company policy

392
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:33,440
it's often

393
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:36,480
um an overlooked risk of

394
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:39,839
information thanks ashley and ty i

395
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:40,959
suppose as someone who

396
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:42,320
you know you've run you're on your own

397
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,320
company and um you know you've got you

398
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,839
know employees and staff and other

399
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:47,440
things to sort of consider

400
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,199
how has how has this sort of impacted

401
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:52,639
yourself over these last six months

402
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:56,240
yeah look i mean when uh other than the

403
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:58,710
covered beard that i had to grow um

404
00:13:58,710 --> 00:14:00,079
[Music]

405
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:03,279
when covert kicked off um you know

406
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:06,079
we we all saw the escalation of that

407
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:06,800
global

408
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:10,399
economic financial crisis and obviously

409
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:12,079
um you know a lot of people were sort of

410
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:13,519
worried for their jobs and their

411
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:14,959
businesses so

412
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:16,959
you know straight away when that that

413
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:18,639
kicked off or really

414
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:20,560
you know started becoming more and more

415
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:22,399
serious you know i

416
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:25,360
personally pulled my team into a meeting

417
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:26,000
and

418
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,480
told them two things one was that we had

419
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:30,560
actually planned for this type of event

420
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,959
through our business continuity um plan

421
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:34,079
so so

422
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:37,360
business was um viable and would be

423
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:39,440
you know for a long time so they didn't

424
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:40,720
have to worry

425
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:43,199
um from that perspective but also you

426
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:44,720
know because people were worried about

427
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,000
their jobs

428
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,639
you know i specifically said to them

429
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:49,519
actually

430
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:51,680
you don't have to be worried about your

431
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,279
jobs in

432
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:56,480
security right now um it's actually the

433
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:57,680
opposite uh

434
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:00,639
that you know you need to be worried

435
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:03,199
about how busy you're going to get

436
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:04,959
because and the number of hours you're

437
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:07,120
going to be working because

438
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:09,680
you know and i explained that in these

439
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:11,440
economic downturns

440
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:13,360
they tend to lead to you know

441
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,440
individuals struggling financially that

442
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,839
then leads to and that's globally

443
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:20,160
which then leads to an increase in crime

444
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,040
you know

445
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:23,680
these days the highest profit least risk

446
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:24,160
crime

447
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:26,079
is cyber crime and therefore we're gonna

448
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:27,440
see a massive spike

449
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:30,720
in cybercrime and uh you know i said to

450
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,399
him give it a few months

451
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:35,440
and uh you'll start seeing um a lot of

452
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,440
organizations suffering security

453
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,279
breaches so

454
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:42,079
that pretty much ticked off on the on

455
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:42,880
within a

456
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:45,440
couple of months of uh covert really

457
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:46,160
kicking in

458
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:48,959
and um so from house perspective you

459
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:49,279
know

460
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:52,000
it's been really sad to see some of our

461
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,680
clients who have suffered

462
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:56,160
financially but also you know from from

463
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:57,440
losing

464
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,680
revenue but also some of the clients who

465
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:00,880
have been

466
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:05,279
hit with some of these really um

467
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:08,639
malicious cyber attacks that have really

468
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:10,560
escalated over the last

469
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:13,279
six months yeah i think that's a really

470
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:14,639
good topic we'll certainly get back to

471
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:16,320
security breaches in a minute but

472
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,399
um i mean ryan i'll just jump over to

473
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:20,079
you but just change the topic a little

474
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:21,279
bit if that's okay

475
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:25,199
i mean still sort of on this remote

476
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:26,959
sort of difference in working if you

477
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:28,959
want to call it i've i've noticed a lot

478
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:29,519
that

479
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:31,440
a lot of companies that were doing a lot

480
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:32,560
of business

481
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,800
and a lot of processing on prem are

482
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,079
rushing a lot of things

483
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:38,480
to um trying to get things into the

484
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:39,360
cloud as quickly

485
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,360
as possible and even utilizing some of

486
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:43,600
those you know multi-tenancy sas

487
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:46,320
providers that are out there um lots of

488
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,240
pros and cons with with both of these

489
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,759
and lots of challenges you know from a

490
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:51,360
business perspective to get things

491
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,680
up and running quickly um but obviously

492
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:55,440
lots of security issues that we need to

493
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:56,320
account for

494
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:58,320
have you sort of been um across any of

495
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,839
this and sort of what are your thoughts

496
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:00,320
on

497
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:03,120
um the the transitioning from on-prem to

498
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,240
whether it's a cl

499
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:07,679
a cloud work uh workload or a sas

500
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:10,160
solution

501
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:14,400
yeah so um i think so uh you you

502
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,919
mentioned the keyword there uh

503
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:17,599
you know a lot of companies are rushing

504
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:20,000
right so um it means that

505
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,240
not a lot of things were in place maybe

506
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:23,679
projects are not

507
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:27,280
well thought off um the

508
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:29,360
the capability and the skill set within

509
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:30,400
the organization

510
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:33,360
is not yet present for example um to be

511
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:34,240
able to

512
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:37,280
handle new services new technologies

513
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:40,960
um that are being put online um

514
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:43,280
so there's a lot of things that can go

515
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:45,520
wrong in this type of situation

516
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:49,120
and given that there is a rush to to

517
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:52,400
deploy this immediately um there's a lot

518
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,120
of

519
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:56,160
configuration issues that can happen or

520
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:59,360
some security holes that they might not

521
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:00,720
have patch or

522
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,880
or vulnerabilities that you know that

523
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,799
have not yet been patched or

524
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:08,480
they have inadvertently introduced

525
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:11,200
just because you know they needed to

526
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,160
connect quickly

527
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:15,120
this service with this service and um

528
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:15,840
you know

529
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:18,559
maybe it was just the communication was

530
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:19,919
in plain text

531
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:23,440
the api key is reused or you know

532
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,360
the password is reused so things like

533
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:26,720
this would be more

534
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:29,919
prominent um i would think in this kind

535
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:31,760
of environment where everyone is

536
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:32,960
scrambling

537
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:35,840
so um and it's it's really hard so for

538
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:36,880
example for me i

539
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:40,559
i don't want to be a season right now

540
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:44,080
because um you know there are a lot of

541
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:44,720
things that

542
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:47,440
that i would need to audit that i would

543
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:48,160
need to have

544
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,160
visibility on that i would need to

545
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,520
support and that

546
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:54,320
ultimately i would need to secure so yes

547
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:56,960
um there's a lot of things going on

548
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:00,240
um and for me it's a

549
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:03,039
very high stress environment um

550
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:04,000
currently

551
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,400
and i think this is also why we are here

552
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,480
right um why we are attending black hat

553
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:09,280
why

554
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:11,679
security events like this i'm still

555
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:14,000
still continuing because

556
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,200
it's we still need to be on top of these

557
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:17,919
things

558
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:21,520
so networking updating knowledge

559
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:23,840
um knowing about what security solutions

560
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:24,880
are available

561
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:27,360
on knowing about what vulnerabilities

562
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:28,480
are there and what

563
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:30,320
what vulnerabilities are actually being

564
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:32,160
weaponized and used by attackers

565
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:35,679
so this really um you know plays a key

566
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:36,160
part

567
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:39,840
in helping us strategize um

568
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:42,320
and prioritize what we need to do and

569
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,960
what we need to look out for in this

570
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:48,480
very very challenging period thanks ryan

571
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:49,360
yeah and i mean it's

572
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:50,720
it is really really tricky i mean

573
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,720
there's lots of sas solutions that are

574
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:53,520
going to

575
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:56,400
help a lot of um you know business you

576
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:57,600
know a lot of our businesses

577
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,200
better be able to kick up you know the

578
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,120
digital experience pretty quickly but i

579
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:01,760
mean

580
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,840
you know a lot of a lot of the controls

581
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,600
that we're relying on are things that

582
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:06,000
are in

583
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,640
contracts or you know whether it's a an

584
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:11,039
iso or a sock type report and

585
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:12,720
you know it's it's very subjective you

586
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,480
know there's only a there's a scope that

587
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:15,919
you have to deal with

588
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:18,799
so you know it can be it can be quite

589
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:19,679
challenging

590
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:21,679
um i have noticed we are getting some

591
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:23,440
questions through which is great before

592
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:25,600
i actually jump to the question um

593
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,039
ty i just want to go back to what you

594
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:29,039
were talking about before you know with

595
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:30,880
respect to security breaches

596
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,320
i mean the world definitely has changed

597
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:34,240
in the last six months

598
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:36,080
i mean you know we're virtual six months

599
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:38,000
ago we should have been in singapore

600
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,720
um are we seeing are we seeing like a

601
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:41,840
turn of

602
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:45,039
a turn of what security breaches

603
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:48,000
are developing or look liking um you

604
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,120
know in

605
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:51,200
in in in the last you know in the last

606
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,440
year this year

607
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:56,720
yeah look it it's uh certainly changed

608
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:59,200
you know in the last six months

609
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,080
especially

610
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:03,280
and i actually haven't seen

611
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:07,600
this cyber uh circumstance or situation

612
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:10,720
um occur or has been as

613
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:13,760
aggressive and active over the last 20

614
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:14,720
years

615
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:17,919
um so we're in a very unique time right

616
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:18,480
now

617
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:21,520
um where without trying to scare the

618
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:22,320
sizos

619
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:23,760
as you say i wouldn't want to be in

620
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:26,799
their position right now either

621
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:28,000
but they're going to have a very

622
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,080
challenging time moving forward

623
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:32,559
so you know i mean we've over the last

624
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:33,679
six months we've been

625
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:36,320
absolutely inundated with security

626
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:37,120
breaches

627
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:39,440
um within australia and these aren't

628
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:42,840
small security breaches either these are

629
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:45,200
multinational organizations critical

630
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:47,039
infrastructure providers

631
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:49,440
you know major organizations who are

632
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,080
suffering

633
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:52,960
very targeted very aggressive attacks

634
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:53,520
from

635
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:56,080
international players um all around the

636
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:57,120
world

637
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:59,840
and uh so when we actually got to

638
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:01,440
blackout usa where

639
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:03,520
we were running our training courses i

640
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,960
actually wanted to see

641
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:07,760
if this was being seen just in our

642
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:09,600
region or if this was globally and

643
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:10,480
basically asked

644
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:12,880
all of our students across each of our

645
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,240
training courses

646
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:16,080
and basically they were saying the same

647
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:18,799
thing which was interesting

648
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:22,000
and basically these aren't just

649
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,640
the typical sort of drive by attacks

650
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:25,120
where

651
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:27,840
you know a web server gets breached and

652
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:29,120
you know the attacker

653
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:31,919
puts some cryptocurrency mining software

654
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:33,520
on there or some

655
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:35,440
you know distributed detailed service

656
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:37,039
tools and they don't even know the

657
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:38,559
company that they've hacked

658
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:40,400
and they start attacking you know

659
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,760
someone else right

660
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:44,320
um and that's not what we've been saying

661
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:44,799
we've

662
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:46,480
each one of them that we've been looking

663
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:48,000
at uh you know

664
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,840
i still think that a bunch of them are

665
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:51,679
still quite opportunistic

666
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:54,720
attacks um but they were certainly

667
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,799
targeted and focused on

668
00:22:56,799 --> 00:22:59,840
not just compromising um

669
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:01,679
the compute power for example of an

670
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:03,600
organization but actually infiltrating

671
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,120
the organization

672
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:07,039
moving laterally escalating their

673
00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:08,240
privileges

674
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:11,520
taking over the organization and then

675
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,280
carrying out their attack whether that

676
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:15,440
was data theft

677
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:18,799
data theft or we've seen a bunch of

678
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:21,840
quite large ransomware attacks where

679
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:22,720
they've encrypted

680
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:25,760
every single server across to this

681
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:26,480
organizer

682
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:29,600
these organizations globally not even

683
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:31,760
just within a particular region

684
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:33,600
and just shutting the entire

685
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:35,679
organization down then holding them to

686
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:36,559
ransom for

687
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:39,919
millions um luckily some of these

688
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:41,919
places had some pretty good backup

689
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:44,000
strategies in place

690
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,640
one with a very impressive disaster

691
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:48,720
recovery situation in place

692
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:51,600
and uh we were able to help them recover

693
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,039
that really really quickly

694
00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:55,919
but uh yeah the actual attacks that

695
00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:56,960
we're seeing

696
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:59,440
you know i think the biggest shift that

697
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:01,520
i've seen is just the aggressiveness

698
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:04,720
and um shifting to infiltrating

699
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:06,720
organizations rather than

700
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:09,120
just grabbing access to their compute

701
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:10,080
power

702
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:12,320
um and that that's really the the key

703
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:14,159
thing and and also having those

704
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:17,279
those consistent attacks so you know we

705
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:18,159
were

706
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:21,120
in one particular situation um jumped in

707
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:22,559
there very quickly we kicked the

708
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:23,760
attacker out

709
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:27,360
um the the actual organization

710
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:29,760
um responded a bit too slowly and

711
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,279
actually got breached

712
00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:34,080
again and we then kicked out the

713
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:34,720
attackers

714
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:37,279
and actually um closed off that hole and

715
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:39,200
then they started coming through with

716
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:41,120
other avenues of attacks like phishing

717
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:43,200
attacks because the infrastructure or

718
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,720
the application layer vulnerabilities

719
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:46,400
were actually closed off

720
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,799
so the fact that they were coming back

721
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:50,480
again and again it was just

722
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:52,880
really interesting to see because you

723
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:54,320
know often

724
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:56,960
uh historically when we kick them out

725
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,400
they tend to then

726
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,240
assume that you know there's a higher

727
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:02,400
risk of getting caught for example

728
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:04,400
and they go and move on to someone else

729
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:05,520
whereas these days

730
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:07,520
they're just they just seem to be coming

731
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:10,159
back again and again

732
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:11,760
and actually are you seeing a difference

733
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:14,000
in the uh the types of security breaches

734
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,520
this these past 12 months

735
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:25,840
i don't really see bridges from my side

736
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:29,440
but as i mentioned there definitely

737
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:31,679
well actually i won't say there are new

738
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:33,120
type of uh

739
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:35,679
security attacks because they are

740
00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:37,440
probably the same old group saw

741
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:39,279
attackers that we were seeing

742
00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:42,240
um but it's just that they are adapting

743
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:43,039
more

744
00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:46,480
um copy than using um people's fear

745
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:49,600
about it to uh doing more social

746
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:51,120
engineering attack

747
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:54,240
and uh try to conduct more

748
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:58,080
um fraud or scam or a facial attack

749
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:01,200
like targeted attack i might turn the

750
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,320
subject a little bit because i know it

751
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:03,600
was something that we were talking about

752
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:04,720
in the green room before

753
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:06,559
just just the subject of uh

754
00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:08,000
misinformation

755
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,679
um and i know actually this is something

756
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:11,360
that you're quite passionate about too

757
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:14,720
i mean how how do we think as a as a i

758
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:16,480
guess as a community do you think we can

759
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:19,120
fight this a little bit better

760
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:20,960
yeah i think this is a very good

761
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:22,480
question um

762
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:24,880
i think that the most important part of

763
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:25,919
the rules as

764
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:29,200
a security community um is to increase

765
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:30,880
the public awareness of

766
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:33,360
this information and provide a platform

767
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:34,559
for the research

768
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:37,600
um after the elections in 2016 there are

769
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,600
more focus and research on the field in

770
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:40,559
the us

771
00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:42,880
but in my opinion it doesn't get enough

772
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:44,480
attention in asia

773
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:47,039
i also hope that we can provide the

774
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:47,760
platform

775
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:49,600
and opportunity to encourage more

776
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,360
research in this area and

777
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:53,919
have more research to show people how we

778
00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:56,480
identify the disinformation operations

779
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:59,520
because um despite that this is now hot

780
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:00,480
issues and

781
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:04,080
general public um still they have very

782
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:06,240
little understanding on

783
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:08,880
how the social media or platform track

784
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:10,960
is operations and mitigates

785
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:14,320
and this kind of asymmetric informations

786
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:15,520
will cause more

787
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:19,520
uh conspiracy and becomes a barriers for

788
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:22,240
our remediations and this is why i'm

789
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:24,399
really happy to see that we have

790
00:27:24,399 --> 00:27:27,120
um talk submitted for the research on

791
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:29,279
fake news analysis this year i attended

792
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:30,159
the talk it was a

793
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:33,520
really great talk and um in the past we

794
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:36,399
really or never saw briefing in black

795
00:27:36,399 --> 00:27:36,720
hai

796
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:39,200
asia to talk about these informations

797
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:41,520
and i think this talk would definitely

798
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:43,360
help more people to understand from the

799
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:44,720
analysts perspective

800
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:47,679
how we identify the operations and

801
00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:48,320
hopefully

802
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:51,200
we will uh going to see more research

803
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:51,919
toward

804
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:54,880
uh these directions and uh eventually

805
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:55,600
there were

806
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:58,000
based on frameworks of the analysis

807
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,440
approach that people

808
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:02,720
people can follow

809
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:05,200
thanks ashley um brian i don't know do

810
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,480
you have any thoughts on this subject

811
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:08,159
otherwise i might jump over to a

812
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:09,520
question what do you think about this

813
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:10,880
subject

814
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,640
about this information yeah um so i

815
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,240
think uh what

816
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:17,440
what i think about it is that we also

817
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:19,840
kind of look at it in a vacuum like it's

818
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:21,760
just this information happening

819
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:24,559
um it's also driven by certain

820
00:28:24,559 --> 00:28:26,240
conditions that we are in right now so

821
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,279
for example

822
00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:30,720
um right now we are in a groved

823
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:31,840
situation

824
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:34,960
wherein everyone is mostly online so

825
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:37,200
the the uh the effect of this

826
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:39,520
information is actually amplified

827
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:42,559
because people are checking their

828
00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:44,960
checking for news or using social media

829
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:46,080
accounts to

830
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:48,880
communicate with family members that

831
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:50,000
they are not

832
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:53,440
you know able to get physically or

833
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:56,480
meet face-to-face right and also we it's

834
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:56,880
a

835
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:59,440
it's an election year in the us this

836
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:00,960
year and i think that also

837
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:04,080
plays into all this politics and and you

838
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:04,640
know

839
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:07,919
um and um disinformation

840
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:10,240
campaigns that are going on so um i

841
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:12,720
think yeah this year is a very difficult

842
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:13,279
year

843
00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:17,360
um especially with the disinformation

844
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:20,960
and the the environment

845
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:24,080
that you know cultivates

846
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:28,320
or or makes that possible

847
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:30,799
thanks ryan um so there's a couple of

848
00:29:30,799 --> 00:29:32,000
questions that have popped up

849
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,600
um i'll go through the first one and

850
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,200
this goes back to our discussion about

851
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:36,399
working from home

852
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:40,000
and um just just securing things now

853
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,440
that we're you know none of us are in

854
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:42,880
the office anymore so

855
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:44,720
question what we've got is how can a

856
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:47,679
company take care of its digital assets

857
00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:49,120
when it's allowing its cu when it's

858
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:51,039
allowing its employees to work from home

859
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:53,840
so in particular most organizations

860
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:54,240
should

861
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:56,799
be using a secure vpn should that be

862
00:29:56,799 --> 00:29:57,919
enough

863
00:29:57,919 --> 00:30:00,000
um i mean i've got i got a bit of a

864
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
viewpoint on vpns and i think

865
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,919
i think you know it depends if you're an

866
00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:06,240
on-prem or a cloud-based company i mean

867
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:08,240
things can definitely be secured

868
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:10,960
using a vpn or you know you you've got a

869
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:12,720
multi-factor approach if you're not if

870
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:13,919
you're going to go straight to cloud

871
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:15,120
without a vpn

872
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:16,720
you obviously need those second factors

873
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:18,399
but i mean definitely love to hear

874
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:20,880
someone else's opinion on this i mean um

875
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:22,880
tied to you again i've gone back to you

876
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:24,559
because you've got your own business

877
00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:27,600
but securing you know assets is what are

878
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:29,679
your thoughts on this

879
00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:32,799
yeah look i think um this has really

880
00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:37,279
uh escalated the whole xero trust model

881
00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:40,320
um where now that everyone's sort of

882
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:41,360
distributed

883
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:43,120
all over the place and this has been

884
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:45,440
quite a common challenge in

885
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:48,399
uh industries like uh aviation where

886
00:30:48,399 --> 00:30:48,960
they're

887
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:50,960
a large portion of their staff is

888
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:52,640
actually constantly

889
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:54,399
you know in other countries or flying

890
00:30:54,399 --> 00:30:56,640
around or in hotels and those

891
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:59,919
things um and we've seen really

892
00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:03,760
effective distributed security models

893
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:05,840
using that zero trust

894
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:09,200
um approach where you know you're

895
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,919
not trusting the end device basically

896
00:31:11,919 --> 00:31:13,679
sending everything through

897
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:16,960
a vpn that enforces policies and

898
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:19,760
using identity based access to be able

899
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:20,240
to

900
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:22,720
um gain access to only those systems

901
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:23,440
that

902
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:26,640
they require access to and ultimately by

903
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:28,559
doing that approach

904
00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:32,320
you can actually sort of isolate those

905
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:35,039
systems from uh threats that are at home

906
00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:36,000
because

907
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,519
you know when you're when you own a home

908
00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:39,200
network they no longer

909
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:40,559
you know typically you're connecting

910
00:31:40,559 --> 00:31:42,320
over things like wi-fi

911
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:43,919
but you've got your corporate network

912
00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:46,159
that they might have for the mature ones

913
00:31:46,159 --> 00:31:46,880
anyway

914
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:50,320
of wi-fi with digital certificates and

915
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:52,080
you know hooked into their id with

916
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:54,080
password policies and those sort of

917
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:54,720
things

918
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:57,519
which just don't exist on most home

919
00:31:57,519 --> 00:31:58,559
networks

920
00:31:58,559 --> 00:32:02,320
so you're placing uh individuals

921
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:05,279
in a less secure environment that has

922
00:32:05,279 --> 00:32:06,000
less

923
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,240
visibility by the organization less

924
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:10,399
controlled by the organization

925
00:32:10,399 --> 00:32:14,720
and therefore you need to enforce that

926
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:17,919
sort of virtual boundary around

927
00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:19,760
the systems that allow you to connect

928
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:21,279
into your organization

929
00:32:21,279 --> 00:32:23,360
whilst not hindering obviously the

930
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:24,880
business functionality

931
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:27,760
and i think that zero trust model by

932
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:29,519
enforcing the security on the device

933
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:30,559
that's connecting

934
00:32:30,559 --> 00:32:32,640
um as well as the identity that's

935
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:34,720
connecting is a really good model for

936
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:37,039
organizations to follow um in this sort

937
00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:38,559
of climate

938
00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:39,760
yeah and i still think there's still a

939
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:42,399
lot of resistance as well with um

940
00:32:42,399 --> 00:32:43,760
you know especially when you're moving

941
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:45,519
to a cloud where there may not

942
00:32:45,519 --> 00:32:47,279
necessarily be a vpn that could be

943
00:32:47,279 --> 00:32:48,559
enforced where

944
00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:50,640
you know the business requirements still

945
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:52,320
don't want that multi-factor

946
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:53,440
you know they just want to be able to

947
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:54,960
log on and if you're creating local

948
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:56,320
credentials well then that's just going

949
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:58,559
to open up to credential misuse

950
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:00,000
and you know you're going to have your

951
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,840
security breaches all over the case

952
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:03,519
all over the place sorry so it's

953
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:04,880
definitely definitely an interesting

954
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:06,399
discussion what about you ryan i mean

955
00:33:06,399 --> 00:33:08,320
what are you what are your thoughts on

956
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:10,480
um you know being able to secure those

957
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:12,399
digital assets i mean do we need to use

958
00:33:12,399 --> 00:33:13,120
vpn

959
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:16,880
or or or is there another way yeah um

960
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:18,799
for me i would take a pragmatic approach

961
00:33:18,799 --> 00:33:20,799
about it so um i would

962
00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:24,159
i would review where the company data is

963
00:33:24,159 --> 00:33:27,440
and if it's mostly um you know if they

964
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:28,159
come

965
00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:30,640
they've already been adopting the cloud

966
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:32,960
then maybe they can accelerate their

967
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:36,320
their migration to you know office 365

968
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:37,679
or google docs or whatever

969
00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:40,080
cloud service that they're using or if

970
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:41,279
they're

971
00:33:41,279 --> 00:33:44,480
um if their files uh if their databases

972
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:45,360
are still

973
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:48,640
in in you know corporate lands then

974
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:50,960
maybe vpn is the way that they is the

975
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:53,519
way to go um

976
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:56,320
i'm recommending this because i think

977
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:56,720
it's

978
00:33:56,720 --> 00:34:00,080
it's difficult to transition to one or

979
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:03,600
over the other um at this point in time

980
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:07,679
especially that hardware and deployment

981
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:10,239
is going to be difficult because people

982
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:11,918
are not in the office

983
00:34:11,918 --> 00:34:13,679
you need to also consider i.t support

984
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:15,839
for example if something goes wrong and

985
00:34:15,839 --> 00:34:16,639
you

986
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:17,918
you change something something goes

987
00:34:17,918 --> 00:34:19,760
wrong how do you

988
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:23,359
you know the issue and there is

989
00:34:23,359 --> 00:34:26,800
man hour costs um related to that right

990
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:29,760
so what my recommendation actually is to

991
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:30,079
to

992
00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:32,960
strengthen what you already have um

993
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:34,320
because um

994
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:36,079
you know deploying something new would

995
00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:37,679
be

996
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:39,918
um would be very difficult um in this

997
00:34:39,918 --> 00:34:42,239
time and um regarding the plans

998
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:45,520
probably just i wanted to point out that

999
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:49,199
um you know big um big ip

1000
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:52,719
f5 networks vpn they had a

1001
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:56,719
vulnerability um july yes uh yeah july

1002
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:59,520
that was um there was a weaponization of

1003
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:00,880
that vulnerability

1004
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:03,280
a few days later and actually in our

1005
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:04,720
telemetry we see

1006
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:07,760
that there's a lot of active attempts

1007
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:09,920
in exploitation for this vulnerability

1008
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:12,640
so maybe this is also something that

1009
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:16,000
um you know you guys need to

1010
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,800
put into the equation that um if you

1011
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,640
have not considered

1012
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:24,320
um including vpn clients or

1013
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:27,359
vpn servers in into your you know what

1014
00:35:27,359 --> 00:35:27,680
you

1015
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:30,880
enter checklist in in vulnerability

1016
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:32,240
update or in scanning

1017
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:35,200
it is a very good time to do so because

1018
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:35,599
this

1019
00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:37,200
environment and the recent

1020
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:38,800
vulnerabilities that

1021
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:41,440
that we've seen and also the attack

1022
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:42,320
patterns

1023
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:45,359
um point to attackers actually having

1024
00:35:45,359 --> 00:35:48,400
interest in these kind of things thanks

1025
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:49,280
ryan

1026
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:51,680
um so just going through these questions

1027
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:53,440
again tie this one

1028
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:55,520
to you but i think probably both i might

1029
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:57,200
target both you and ashley at the same

1030
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:58,720
time

1031
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:01,040
it's the question says um there's only

1032
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:02,480
one nation that this particular

1033
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:04,000
individual knows of with

1034
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,880
a reputation of repeated attacks does

1035
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:09,599
ty's observation mean this is wider now

1036
00:36:09,599 --> 00:36:13,839
and even extended to criminal attacks

1037
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:19,200
yeah look um i certainly wouldn't put it

1038
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:20,720
down to one nation

1039
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:24,079
at all uh i think that we've seen this

1040
00:36:24,079 --> 00:36:27,359
across many nations and

1041
00:36:27,359 --> 00:36:29,520
you know they've come out and and

1042
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:31,680
actively said this in the past

1043
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:35,839
um from from uh multiple countries so

1044
00:36:35,839 --> 00:36:39,040
you know it's definitely not one nation

1045
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:40,560
you know i think one of them

1046
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:43,839
cops to blame a lot uh whether it's them

1047
00:36:43,839 --> 00:36:44,480
or not it's

1048
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:47,520
it's extremely hard to

1049
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:50,640
do proper attribution of

1050
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:52,960
where the attacks are coming from it is

1051
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:54,240
very easy to

1052
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:56,160
fake where the attacks are coming from

1053
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:57,359
and you see that with

1054
00:36:57,359 --> 00:37:00,720
a lot of the attacks um that have been

1055
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:02,079
coming through i mean one of the

1056
00:37:02,079 --> 00:37:03,839
national cyber attacks

1057
00:37:03,839 --> 00:37:06,560
against australia that we saw over the

1058
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:08,480
last few months

1059
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:10,320
that the prime minister announced we

1060
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:11,839
were actually investigating that a

1061
00:37:11,839 --> 00:37:12,880
couple of weeks

1062
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:15,440
beforehand for a client that suffered a

1063
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:16,480
breach

1064
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:19,920
and i mean that was assumed by everyone

1065
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:23,520
coming from a specific nation state

1066
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:25,440
and there were definitely indicators

1067
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:26,560
pointing to

1068
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:30,160
um you know countries like china

1069
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:31,920
but when you delve into a lot of the

1070
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:33,200
details there were also

1071
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:35,680
a lot of indicators pointing to russia

1072
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:37,839
there were attacks coming from the us

1073
00:37:37,839 --> 00:37:40,160
there were attacks coming through tour

1074
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:40,880
um

1075
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:43,440
and we've seen others from a whole bunch

1076
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:45,839
of other countries that weren't related

1077
00:37:45,839 --> 00:37:46,320
to

1078
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:49,520
china for example who constantly comes

1079
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:50,079
up

1080
00:37:50,079 --> 00:37:51,839
i'm not saying that they're not doing it

1081
00:37:51,839 --> 00:37:53,359
what i'm saying is that

1082
00:37:53,359 --> 00:37:55,599
it is extremely hard to attribute that

1083
00:37:55,599 --> 00:37:57,040
to anyone when you see

1084
00:37:57,040 --> 00:38:00,800
indicators coming from every uh

1085
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:02,400
you know almost every country on the

1086
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,320
planet and

1087
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:06,720
from what i've seen over the last um

1088
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:08,320
three to six months

1089
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:12,359
is that these are not necessarily

1090
00:38:12,359 --> 00:38:15,920
nation-based attacks

1091
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:19,520
they've more being focused around

1092
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:23,280
cybercrime and financial gains

1093
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:24,450
and

1094
00:38:24,450 --> 00:38:26,880
[Music]

1095
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:28,960
you know even i think one of the

1096
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:31,280
interesting things that

1097
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:33,680
you know you have to take with a bit of

1098
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:34,880
grainy and salt

1099
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:38,320
um in in the media from governments

1100
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:39,920
talking about all these things which

1101
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:41,920
comes back to some of the disinformation

1102
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:43,680
that or misinformation that

1103
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:46,960
gets put out there is one

1104
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:49,599
the hype around some of these attacks

1105
00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:52,320
and how sophisticated there are they are

1106
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:55,440
um i definitely don't think that a lot

1107
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:57,760
of these are sophisticated in any way

1108
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:59,280
whatsoever

1109
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:01,359
what i've been describing to people is

1110
00:39:01,359 --> 00:39:03,760
that they're organized

1111
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:06,320
and therefore able to break into

1112
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:07,839
organizations

1113
00:39:07,839 --> 00:39:10,480
they can then escalate themselves very

1114
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:11,359
quickly

1115
00:39:11,359 --> 00:39:13,359
but really the techniques and the

1116
00:39:13,359 --> 00:39:15,119
attacks i mean our guys have sort of

1117
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:17,040
laughed at some of the

1118
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:18,800
some of the approaches that they've

1119
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:20,880
taken and just questioned why you would

1120
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:22,079
go down that path

1121
00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:24,240
um you know when it would be much easier

1122
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:26,320
to do this sort of attack

1123
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:28,240
but i think that comes down to the

1124
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:29,839
methodology that they've got in place

1125
00:39:29,839 --> 00:39:32,000
because they're organized attackers

1126
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,480
rather than sophisticated you know

1127
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:35,200
nation

1128
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:37,599
state attackers but yeah definitely more

1129
00:39:37,599 --> 00:39:38,960
financially motivated

1130
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:41,520
and when you look back at the um i think

1131
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:42,079
came out

1132
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:45,040
in uh 2018 and said it was up to two

1133
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:47,040
trillion dollars of cyberphone

1134
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:49,680
revenue that gets laundered every year

1135
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:50,079
uh

1136
00:39:50,079 --> 00:39:53,040
that's a huge financial goal to to go

1137
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:54,960
after even just to get a chunk of that

1138
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:56,560
and i think in the economic

1139
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:58,880
times that we're in uh where a lot of

1140
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:00,320
places are struggling

1141
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:01,680
that's going to be the main thing that

1142
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:04,079
people are going to be going after

1143
00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:07,040
thanks tai just taking note of uh the

1144
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:08,480
the calendar i think we're all out of

1145
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:09,359
time

1146
00:40:09,359 --> 00:40:12,000
but look i want to thank all of you

1147
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:12,480
again

1148
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:15,119
and for making the time to discuss

1149
00:40:15,119 --> 00:40:17,119
today's events and some of the topics

1150
00:40:17,119 --> 00:40:18,560
that have impacted all of us i think

1151
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:19,680
these last

1152
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:23,200
six months definitely come back tomorrow

1153
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:23,680
this

1154
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:26,319
keynote's going to be a good one um and

1155
00:40:26,319 --> 00:40:27,440

1156
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:29,760
you know got any questions ping us
