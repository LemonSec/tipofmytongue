1
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:03,600
uh hello i am consultant

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:07,520
and this is we we have come from

3
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:10,719
baidu security lab uh to talk to you

4
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:11,200
about

5
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:14,719
the eu spec cameras we hope that

6
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:17,119
this talk will help you to understand

7
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:19,680
when swear cameras are evil

8
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:23,199
so we can work to emulate his

9
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:27,199
learn from our society

10
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:30,880
okay this is the outlaw for today's talk

11
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:34,000
photo we will introduce the subject

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,280
by talking about the research background

13
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:38,640
of spy cameras

14
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:42,079
and some related news stories

15
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:44,320
we will talk about the structure of

16
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:45,440
spare cameras

17
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:47,920
i'll demonstrate a simple scanning

18
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:48,719
method

19
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:51,760
and discuss some of the

20
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:55,600
vulnerabilities we have found finally

21
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:58,000
finally we will introduce some other

22
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,039
detection methods

23
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:04,319
okay so to start with let's look at some

24
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:07,680
new stories about spare cameras using

25
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:11,360
these pictures for example you can see

26
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:14,560
that the spare cameras can come in many

27
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:15,119
different

28
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:18,240
shapes and sets

29
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:22,159
here is a new story

30
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:26,240
where 1600 material gas

31
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:29,680
or single regularly stream the lab

32
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:32,799
in south korea according to

33
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:35,759
the place tiny cameras with one

34
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:37,200

lens or hidden in trailer holders

36
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:44,880
set tv boxes and

37
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:48,399
closed electro trucker circuits

38
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:51,680
model 800 initially

39
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:55,759
multimedia streamed in

40
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:59,759
world stream the lab website

41
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:02,880
all six thousand and

42
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,439
eight hundred cases of the scan were

43
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:06,880
reported

44
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:11,280
to a south korean place in 2018

45
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:14,640
but many others have gone and reported

46
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:18,959
or detected as the picture on the thread

47
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:19,760
shows

48
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:23,200
a malleable your palm spell cameras

49
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:26,319
is becoming more and more serious for

50
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:27,599
example

51
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:30,800
one of the most popular spare camera

52
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:34,239
apps has been downloaded more than

53
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:36,319
one million times on the google play

54
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:37,599
store

55
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:40,959
each download could represent

56
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:44,319
a real world space camera that is the

57
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:48,000
um that is beyond

58
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,080
secretly used to spare on people

59
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:55,200
as secular researchers we are trying to

60
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,640
do something to

61
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:00,080
eliminate to eliminate

62
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:04,560
the evil

63
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:08,480
this uh this slide shows some example of

64
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:09,840
spy cameras

65
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:13,040
that have been detailed in china

66
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:16,480
pictures like this tell us what we are

67
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:19,519
dealing with you can see that most of

68
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:20,560
the cameras

69
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:23,280
have a very small circuit about

70
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,319
connected to

71
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:28,799
a power supply and a micro lens

72
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:31,280
spare cameras aren't just a phone in

73
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,400
china and south

74
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:36,480
korea but all over the world

75
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:41,599
we've just seen what the spec camera

76
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:42,720
looks like

77
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:45,440
but now let's have a look at a spa

78
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,560
camera in

79
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,599
this gas these pictures

80
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:52,720
were taken by mr hua

81
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:56,239
who introduced a very various hiding

82
00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:58,239
method of spare cameras through

83
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:02,000
um radio spec cameras are usually

84
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,280
hidden in ordinary household objects

85
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,239
like

86
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:09,280
like chargers air conditioners

87
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:12,400
behind the toilets in tv

88
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:15,680
in the router in wall panel and

89
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:19,440
so on uh it's clear

90
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:22,960
that these cameras are very small

91
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:26,639
even so many can be

92
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:30,240
equipped with inferior networking

93
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:33,470
and record in 4k hd

94
00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:36,499
[Music]

95
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,199
as i have mentioned that back cameras

96
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:40,880
are far more common that

97
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:44,960
you might think they have become of

98
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:48,560
hottest social issues in china and

99
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:51,680
other countries and the

100
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,960
intro national problem the

101
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:57,520
team are usually hotel guests and

102
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:58,479
renters

103
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:01,600
and young men are targeted

104
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:04,800
most often spa cameras allow

105
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,919
nasty a man to snake or look

106
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:12,479
into other people's private lab

107
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:16,360
it sounds terrible but we have

108
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:19,360
investigated the problem and we found

109
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,080
that

110
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:24,240
there is no reliable way to find this

111
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,479
hands by cameras

112
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:29,039
the fact is that no one knows enough

113
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:29,520
about

114
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:34,160
them we should clarify that

115
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:37,120
we are talking about hidden spec cameras

116
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:37,680
are not

117
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:41,840
the smarter for more cameras

118
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:45,120
these hidden spare cameras are small

119
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,800
have a very small lens

120
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:50,840
and regularly modular and no

121
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:53,360
regression is required to

122
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:56,479
purchase them it can

123
00:05:56,479 --> 00:05:59,919
be easily hidden in air conditions

124
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:02,160
on its tvs through towards the patch

125
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,319
panels black sockets

126
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:07,600
the list goes up because of this

127
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,960
kind of characteristics uh

128
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:14,000
that camera are

129
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,039
difficult to find

130
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:20,319
so how do we go about trying to find

131
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:21,360
them

132
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,800
well first we needed to have a look at

133
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:28,000
some by camera ourselves

134
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,199
china has banned this sale

135
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:35,720
of cameras chinese online

136
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:38,960
retailers like taobao jingdong

137
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:41,380
don't sell them uh

138
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:42,479
[Music]

139
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:46,080
eventually we managed to get our hands

140
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:46,720
on some

141
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:50,880
using ebay and other servers we found

142
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:55,520
using such engineers

143
00:06:57,199 --> 00:06:59,680
we can find that spec camera are no

144
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,680
longer available on top

145
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:05,599
it seems that china's actions are faster

146
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:09,319
so what do what to do next

147
00:07:09,319 --> 00:07:12,319
unfortunately you still can buy it on

148
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:14,720
ebay

149
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:18,319
there are some product images of the

150
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:19,680
spare camera

151
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:23,360
and they value attractive

152
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:28,160
due to the slow speed or express deliver

153
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:32,000
the first start collecting the camera

154
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,120
control apps for example research

155
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:39,360
for using back cameras on youtube

156
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:44,000
we also slow down the video to find

157
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,680
the seller's mobile desktop because

158
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:51,360
usually sellers will install popular

159
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:54,800
camera apps in this picture we can see

160
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:58,639
many publishers by camera such as the ua

161
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:02,319
km p2k view edges back camera

162
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:04,560
and

163
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:09,199
each spec camera includes a dedicated

164
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:10,000
menu

165
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,599
which includes a qr code to download the

166
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:17,680
associated a app the default wifi

167
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:18,560
passport

168
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:21,680
password and so on

169
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:26,479
we found the qr code oh app so the item

170
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:30,520
description page for ebay and the video

171
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:34,559
tutorials to prepare for the following

172
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:37,839
unless okay now

173
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:40,958
i will send it over for changing

174
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:43,919
okay now let's look at the structure of

175
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:48,000
spy camera and how to analyze it

176
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,720
we purchased a number of different

177
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:51,839
models of

178
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:55,200
camera from multiple sellers our goal is

179
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,560
to find a simple

180
00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:00,480
fast and reliable way to discover if a

181
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,160
spy camera was present

182
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:04,959
in any room

183
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:08,720
we tried all kinds of traditional

184
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,160
methods but

185
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:13,120
could not find a solution for example we

186
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:13,839
often look

187
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:16,959
for devices emitting a right light to

188
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:18,320
find cameras but

189
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:21,519
this didn't work well we tried using a

190
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:22,000
wireless

191
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,440
signal detector but but we

192
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,720
encountered a lot of false alarms

193
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:31,279
so we found some new reports saying that

194
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:32,560
led is behind

195
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:36,000
mirrors or open cameras however

196
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,120
a lot of mirrors now come with leds

197
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,080
built-in

198
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:43,360
it's just a power light so we found an

199
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:46,800
app that claimed it could detect hidden

200
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:50,160
cameras but when we investigated

201
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:53,519
we found it was detecting magnetic

202
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:57,040
fields any electronic device or

203
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:00,320
magnet and it's one of these

204
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:03,040
so we were no close to find a way to

205
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:06,800
detect spy cameras

206
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,680
let's take a closer look at the

207
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,839
structure of a spy camera

208
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:14,959
the original model is actually an

209
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:18,480
embedded internet of things devices

210
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,959
the circus board usually has a high

211
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:22,160
silicon

212
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:26,000
or any car or some other arm processors

213
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,800
the cameras has had always had a nor

214
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:31,519
flash device to store files

215
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:34,800
a wifi chip and a micro lens

216
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,519
each spy camera runs a p2p camera

217
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:39,920
service

218
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:44,480
so like we showed in this picture this

219
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:48,079
is part of our analysis the devices come

220
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:48,560
in

221
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:51,200
different shapes and sizes some have

222
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:51,680
large

223
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:55,760
batteries some have infrared lenses

224
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:59,440
some support 4k recording but in general

225
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:03,279
they all have a similar structure

226
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:07,279
so we know what this spy camera looks

227
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:07,760
like

228
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:10,880
and what is inside them but how

229
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:14,000
are they hidden in everyday objects here

230
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,680
you can see an ordinary power strip

231
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:20,000
well you can you can see a small small

232
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,279
led light that

233
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:23,360
looks a little uneuro let's take it

234
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,480
apart

235
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:27,120
it's clear that there are some

236
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,079
differences between

237
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:31,279
this and a normal power strip

238
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:33,920
why because this is a spy camera hiding

239
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,040
inside it

240
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:37,120
it is getting a continuous power

241
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,560
supplies

242
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:42,079
through transformer but all the time but

243
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:44,640
at the same time the power strip

244
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:47,760
is working normally so yes

245
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:50,000
i have i have been using it in my

246
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,920
occasion and no one noticed it that

247
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:56,639
it was a spy camera

248
00:11:56,639 --> 00:11:58,720
well let's take a look at the functions

249
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,480
of a spy camera

250
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,720
the they include the remote control

251
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,800
feature online streaming

252
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:09,519
and video downloads support motion alarm

253
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:11,519
let's learn how to use this device

254
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:25,839
through a video

255
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:39,839
foreign

256
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:21,839
um

257
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:03,839
uh

258
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:18,639
next we will introduce a method to scan

259
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:22,320
the spy camera using an app

260
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:25,279
well first let's take a look at how the

261
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:27,600
spy camera is connected to the app

262
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:32,079
and our device it uses udp based p2b

263
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:34,399
technology because of the firewall

264
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:35,519
policy

265
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:38,000
the phone cannot connect directly to the

266
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,199
spy camera

267
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:41,680
therefore the mobile phone and the spy

268
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:44,240
camera exchange information through a

269
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:46,639
transit server this is how they find

270
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:48,720
each other's ip address and net port

271
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,639
mapping

272
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:52,959
then they you send the udp packets to

273
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:53,680
each other

274
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:56,800
this is called p2p hole punching at this

275
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:57,760
point the app

276
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:00,959
and the camera are connected and the

277
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:04,399
far farewell is no longer a barrier

278
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:07,360
now the mobile app can communicate

279
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:11,120
directly with the spy camera

280
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,600
well we have mentioned that the spy

281
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,920
camera will connect to some specific

282
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:19,519
domain names and ips as the picture on

283
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:20,880
the right shows up

284
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:23,199
there are multiples by camera requesting

285
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:24,880
dns

286
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:28,079
after analyzing the firmware of these

287
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:29,519
spy cameras

288
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:32,240
we found that the domain names and ips

289
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:34,000
are hard coded

290
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,320
this seems to be a very accurate and

291
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:39,440
effective way to detect cameras

292
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:42,639
but our goal is to find a simple and

293
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:45,440
effective way to discover the camera

294
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,920
this method need to monitor the

295
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:50,720
network traffic which repair the road

296
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:51,839
privilege

297
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:55,040
another simple way so it seems not easy

298
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:57,360
to do

299
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,440
[Music]

300
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:05,199
okay we found that all spec cameras

301
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:08,160
have the same functions you can add

302
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:08,880
cameras

303
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:12,240
by scanning this process involves

304
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:15,519
manual impulse qr code scanning and

305
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:19,279
network scan the input and qr code can

306
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:21,680
only be added after the camera is

307
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:22,959
connected to the

308
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:27,199
internet but also the cameras still

309
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:30,320
need to be able to perform a network

310
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,120
scan

311
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:33,680
so in order to connect to the device

312
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:34,880
first

313
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:38,160
you need to add it so the network's

314
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:39,839
gaining function

315
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:43,199
this can be done by lessening

316
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:46,880
a network part interestingly this parts

317
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,079
listening service

318
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:51,759
didn't turn off after the camera can

319
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:55,920
connected to the internet

320
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:58,800
this means that we are able to use this

321
00:16:58,800 --> 00:16:59,680
feature

322
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:03,120
to detect cameras

323
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:06,559
uh let's analyze the implementation of

324
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:07,039
this

325
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:10,400
function uh this must be service

326
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:14,240
lesson on the part waiting for scanning

327
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:18,000
to do this more quickly it will use the

328
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,199
broadcaster to send packet because only

329
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:22,160
udp

330
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:25,199
pro temple can broadcast in

331
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:28,480
internet after sending the

332
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:32,160
screening packet the camera receives

333
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:35,200
and detects the message from it

334
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:38,799
then returns new data then the camera

335
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:42,400
and the app are now connected since

336
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:45,520
the app doesn't have any information in

337
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:46,480
advance

338
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:49,919
the first date the first date package

339
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:52,960
sends doesn't need to contain id

340
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:56,080
or other information and android or

341
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:57,440
iphones

342
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:00,880
don't need root permission to send udp

343
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:04,320
broadcast package therefore we can use

344
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:04,640
this

345
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:08,400
method to scan the camera

346
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:12,080
first we need to capture and analyze

347
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:15,280
the package from all the different

348
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:19,600
apps this apps are

349
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:22,960
from our previous collection

350
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:26,320
there are more than 15 kind of apps all

351
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:29,679
which are used for frequently

352
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:33,919
in fact many of them use the same pdp

353
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:34,799
solution

354
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:38,960
so the package design are the same

355
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:42,160
finally we found that with apps used

356
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:46,240
for kind of scanning packets

357
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:49,760
by the end of the 2019

358
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:53,760
they could cover a 95 point

359
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:58,640
of the reported news

360
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:04,960
we announced and capture only four types

361
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:08,400
of scanning packets that use the person

362
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:11,840
to send broadcaster package uh to the

363
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:18,000
address to 5.25.2525

364
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:22,240
generally direct director access to the

365
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:24,080
ud part

366
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:27,600
doesn't return package however a return

367
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:30,160
packet with the date will be received

368
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:33,919
if the package format and the parts are

369
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:35,280
correct

370
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:37,760
for instance the picture on the draft

371
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:38,559
shows

372
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:41,600
that the ld mini came by camera

373
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:44,640
and the reference is being scanned

374
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:49,120
and the return packet with

375
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:53,039
the camera id is received the speed

376
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:56,799
is a brick net due to the broadcast

377
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:59,360
scanning

378
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:04,000
we found an exciting phenomenon that

379
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,840
immense law even though a majority of

380
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:08,400
apps

381
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:11,840
have different names and icons

382
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:15,120
the scanning packet is the same

383
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:18,960
especially for the hdmi cam series

384
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:21,360
more than fifty percent of the spare

385
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:22,159
camera

386
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:26,640
device that we buy uh other ld mini cam

387
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:30,000
series uh led me came was

388
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,120
also very common in the apps we

389
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:36,799
collected earlier let's have a look at

390
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:40,400
the actual case such as well mentioned

391
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:45,840
earlier involving the 1600 motel guests

392
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:46,840
of the

393
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:50,000
security streamed the lab in south

394
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,200
carolina the

395
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:56,320
unesses of news reports show that

396
00:20:56,320 --> 00:21:00,000
these cameras are the enemy came serious

397
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,760
besides they can be judged

398
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:07,200
they can be charged as hdmi cam

399
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:11,200
series where the camera you are in

400
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:14,480
mr hua as well as ui made

401
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:18,000
in several news reports there are more

402
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:18,480
than

403
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:21,120
a million dollars on google play

404
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:22,080
examining

405
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:25,760
other application markets

406
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:31,280
in this slide we can see that the same

407
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:34,400
developers for produce

408
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:38,240
these apps with identical scanning

409
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:39,360
packet

410
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:43,120
this implies that developers

411
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:46,240
may distribute apps with

412
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:49,120
different names and icons in different

413
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:49,919
channels

414
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:53,200
but their functions are the same this

415
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:56,720
may be because manufacturers don't have

416
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:57,200
much

417
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:00,640
energy to develop different

418
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:04,159
spectral solutions it's also convenient

419
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:09,039
for us to detect a spare camera

420
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:14,799
it is possible to develop a backhand

421
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:17,840
scanning app let's analyze the

422
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:18,799
visibility

423
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:22,159
of this player first all spare cameras

424
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:25,679
need to be connected to the hotel

425
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:29,200
a surrounding website and the password

426
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:33,120
is generally unknown second

427
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:36,799
we can unless the ability of scanning

428
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:38,000
packets

429
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,840
and they don't require multiple village

430
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:45,039
therefore in last year gene poss

431
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:48,760
was back camera discovery uh uh

432
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:52,320
compliantation it developed

433
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:55,919
a similar app which has helped us

434
00:22:55,919 --> 00:23:00,720
to discover multiple spare cameras

435
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:03,919
validation is that some

436
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:07,360
renowned security companies

437
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:10,480
our code and the developer app with

438
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:13,280
the same functions

439
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:17,280
publicity on this scanning app

440
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:20,400
though through the

441
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:23,760
registered engineer we found that their

442
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:25,640
rules are

443
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:29,120
identical to hours

444
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:31,760
even the metal address and the time

445
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:32,640
steps

446
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:36,720
are the same

447
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:39,760
okay okay here

448
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:42,159
let me introduce some vulnerabilities of

449
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:43,919
the refund

450
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:47,840
uh like analysis in other iot devices

451
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:50,799
let us analysis of vulnerability of spy

452
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:51,600
cameras

453
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:54,159
these devices are typically for video

454
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:55,919
recording only without

455
00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:59,120
considering security protection hence

456
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:00,320
there are several

457
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:03,440
security issues

458
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:05,679
we found remote command exclusion

459
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:06,720
problems in both

460
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:09,520
four types of devices one part is the

461
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:10,799
security problems

462
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:13,919
of embedded linux systems such as weak

463
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:14,960
telnet password

464
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:18,320
ftp server with root privilege which are

465
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:20,240
associated with the specific

466
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:23,200
hardware the other part is the security

467
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:23,760
issues

468
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:26,720
associated with with the four p2p camera

469
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:28,240
solutions

470
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:30,960
what can we do with these availabilities

471
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:32,960
maybe we can help the place to

472
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:35,520
collect evidence or stop these spy

473
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:38,639
cameras from working

474
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,120
first in the hd minicam solution we

475
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:46,080
found two high risk vulnerabilities

476
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:48,240
one of them is the vulnerability of

477
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:49,520
getting the id

478
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:52,799
username and password in which we need

479
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:53,200
to

480
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:56,240
send only one packet the figure

481
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:59,840
is in the upper right corner shows that

482
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:02,960
after sending the packet we get a id

483
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:06,240
username and password information we can

484
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:07,520
utilize this

485
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:10,240
information to log in to the spy camera

486
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:11,600
directly

487
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:14,480
which is equivalent to owning this

488
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:15,200
camera

489
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:18,240
at the same time now we can

490
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:21,200
only use it in the internet as a server

491
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:21,679
of

492
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:25,679
hd minicam has been stopped

493
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:28,919
another vulnerability is that the rec

494
00:25:28,919 --> 00:25:30,960
action.cgi has a remote

495
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:34,159
command execution therefore we can

496
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:37,120
execute any commands by just in visit a

497
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:39,600
url

498
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:44,480
uh in the p2p cam viewer solution we

499
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:45,200
found a

500
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:48,240
command injection vulnerability the poc

501
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:48,799
above

502
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:51,679
also calls a rca vulnerability with root

503
00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:54,320
privilege

504
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:57,279
this is a vulnerability reform in the

505
00:25:57,279 --> 00:25:58,720
camvil solution

506
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:01,919
it has an anonymous ftp service with red

507
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:03,279
permission

508
00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:07,600
hence we can get a show in various ways

509
00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:10,960
okay now let us introduce some

510
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:12,240
additional

511
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:15,520
detection methods

512
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:18,640
well we found that some sometimes the

513
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:20,880
manufacturer's information of the mac

514
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:23,120
address is the same although the device

515
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:24,720
hardware is different

516
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:27,919
we suspect that the majority of devices

517
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:30,640
are made from the same manufacturers

518
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:33,840
and utilize the same wi-fi chip

519
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:36,480
hence we can obtain the mac address to

520
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:37,760
help determine whether

521
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:40,880
it is a spy camera or not if the mac

522
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:43,039
address is blacklisted

523
00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:46,240
it will be very suspicious in the lower

524
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:48,640
right corner is a new picture

525
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:52,720
is a news picture of the 1600 thousand

526
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:55,760
south korean guests these mac address

527
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:59,120
are all blacklisted

528
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:03,200
also we can scan some unique ports in

529
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:03,679
the

530
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:08,080
internet such as port 80 and port 554

531
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:11,200
however there may be some false positive

532
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:14,080
sometimes we can even directly access

533
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:14,480
port

534
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:20,240
554 towards the video

535
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:23,919
let us look at the electromagnetic

536
00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:26,799
signal detection traditionally there are

537
00:27:26,799 --> 00:27:27,440
several

538
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:30,640
faults positive however the spine camera

539
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:31,520
requires

540
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:34,960
remote control and wi-fi therefore why

541
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:36,559
don't we just use a

542
00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:39,520
wi-fi signal for detection in order to

543
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:41,200
detect the wi-fi signal

544
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:43,840
we need a network card that supports

545
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:45,440
monitor mode

546
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:48,720
we can use rssi value for wi-fi signal

547
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:50,080
detection

548
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:51,760
let's get close to everything in the

549
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:54,240
house if the value of rssi

550
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:57,919
increases it proves that there is a

551
00:27:57,919 --> 00:28:00,880
wi-fi equipment here so we can also get

552
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:01,520
the mac

553
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:04,640
device's mic address and detect it as

554
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:06,000
per the blacklist

555
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,200
we mentioned earlier

556
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:13,520
some cameras have a net mode feature in

557
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:15,200
order to work at night

558
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:18,159
for instance the alarm clock camera

559
00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:19,360
module has

560
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:22,320
has an infrared light version hence we

561
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:24,960
can turn off the lights and detect them

562
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:27,760
with our mobile phone camera however the

563
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:30,399
mobile phone has a filter

564
00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:33,360
therefore the best way is to utilize an

565
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:34,159
infrared

566
00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:37,679
camera for for instance the infrared

567
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:39,760
camera will be modified on the right

568
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:45,279
from a sony camera

569
00:28:45,279 --> 00:28:47,600
let us look at the detection by the

570
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:48,720
metal

571
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:51,679
detector and ac tester it can be

572
00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:52,480
utilized

573
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,799
as a helper method to find the easy

574
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:56,159
power supply

575
00:28:56,159 --> 00:28:58,080
because the camera needs a permanent

576
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:00,879
power supply

577
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:03,440
for some reason the spy camera's

578
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:04,559
temperature is

579
00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:07,279
generally very high therefore in this

580
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:08,399
house

581
00:29:08,399 --> 00:29:13,120
we can use a thermal imager to detect it

582
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:16,399
and quickly find hot spaces it purchased

583
00:29:16,399 --> 00:29:16,880
some

584
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:20,080
portable thermal images such as flare

585
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:21,279
one

586
00:29:21,279 --> 00:29:23,919
which is a little expensive but it

587
00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:27,840
worked very well

588
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:30,000
we also can use wi-fi real-time

589
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,760
decryption to decrypt

590
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:34,480
all the network traffic by analyzing the

591
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:36,480
spy camera's characteristic

592
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:40,159
in the traffic we can also utilize ips

593
00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:43,440
lds or other network equipments for

594
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:44,559
network traffic

595
00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:47,600
and analysis

596
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:54,559
okay uh there is something news so

597
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:58,720
various efforts the hdmi camera

598
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:02,559
has been shut down and currently

599
00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:06,320
all the rdm cameras are in valid because

600
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:09,760
the server domain and ap in the device

601
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:13,919
are hardcoded furthermore

602
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:17,440
furthermore the quantum place

603
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:20,559
cracks china's largest illegals

604
00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:24,879
selling and buying also back camera

605
00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:29,279
finance admin cams can be

606
00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:32,559
downloaded via the

607
00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:36,240
app store

608
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:40,320
however this is still some bad news

609
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:43,600
we found that the majority of

610
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:46,799
other systems are still working

611
00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:50,159
for instance the pwp came viewer

612
00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:52,960
which has 1 million downloads is still

613
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:54,080
working

614
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:57,760
and the server is still running he said

615
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:01,120
some new systems such as the hd buffer

616
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:02,480
cam pro

617
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:05,760
seems to be very popular recently

618
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:09,120
moreover we found some new attack

619
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:13,279
methods and has a still need to continue

620
00:31:13,279 --> 00:31:15,840
researching

621
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:21,120
in summary a spare camera is terrible

622
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:22,480
and

623
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:25,519
the traditional method has limited the

624
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:28,720
effects however after the security

625
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:29,679
research

626
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:33,279
we can easily detect them

627
00:31:33,279 --> 00:31:38,399
in constant tracks with the efforts of

628
00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:41,840
majority of countries and researchers

629
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:45,200
the problem has been improved i believe

630
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:48,480
we believe that with all members

631
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:51,840
gentle efforts the cameras will be

632
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:52,559
gradually

633
00:31:52,559 --> 00:31:55,440
eradicated

634
00:31:56,640 --> 00:32:01,840
okay yes and
