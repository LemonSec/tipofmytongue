1
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:04,319
hi there i'm charles perrine from trend

2
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:05,120
micro

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:07,680
welcome to faking a factory creating and

4
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:10,480
operating a realistic honeypot

5
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:13,120
we got this idea for creating a factory

6
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:14,400
honeypot

7
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,320
by seeing a bunch of news articles out

8
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:17,920
there about

9
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:21,279
attacks against different factories uh

10
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:23,920
where the attackers installed ransomware

11
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:26,000
on the different systems

12
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,920
so we wanted to create our own factory

13
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:32,558
and see if we could catch anybody trying

14
00:00:32,558 --> 00:00:34,800
to do the same thing on our system

15
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,480
in order to do that we needed to create

16
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:39,120
a realistic ics environment with

17
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,840
proper layout logic equipment and we

18
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:42,480
wanted

19
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:46,000
to be highly interactive such that when

20
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,039
somebody clicked a button on the hmi

21
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:52,239
there would be a real world impact

22
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:54,559
on our system that we were able to

23
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:57,038
monitor

24
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:00,960
so the equipment that we picked up was

25
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:04,559
a siemens s7 1200

26
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:11,039
omron cp1l and two micrologix 1100s

27
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:15,280
and we started to try to develop the

28
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:18,799
logic and what our system was uh

29
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:21,439
kind of before we had any idea what what

30
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:23,200
we wanted to do

31
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,720
and what ended up working best for us

32
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:27,600
was actually creating the hmi first

33
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,720
and once we were able to create the hmi

34
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,720
creating the logic afterwards was a lot

35
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,240
easier for us so once we were able to

36
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:35,280
visualize

37
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,920
what we what our factory did we were

38
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,360
able to create

39
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:42,240
our logic and and program else program

40
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,920
everything else in

41
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,799
so you can see here we have our hmi

42
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:48,240
which has an agitator

43
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:51,119
up at the top and with a tank and that

44
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:54,799
was controlled by our micrologix

45
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:57,920
plc we then

46
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:00,479
had a process heater which would take

47
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:02,320
the product from the tank

48
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:05,360
and heat it up it would then

49
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:08,399
pass that product onto the

50
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:12,160
injector which would mold it and then

51
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,920
it would put drop it onto the conveyor

52
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,440
belt and that was

53
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:18,959
on monitored by our omron

54
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:20,959
and then the product would continue down

55
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:22,560
the conveyor belt it would get inspected

56
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,319
by an electronic eye

57
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:26,640
and then it would get dropped onto a

58
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:27,360
pallet

59
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,040
and eventually once the pallets were

60
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,879
full the palletizer would

61
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:34,080
move the devices off

62
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:37,200
into a different location

63
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,440
so we wanted it to look as realistic as

64
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,200
possible and to do that

65
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:44,400
uh we tried to use real world values so

66
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:48,800
myself and stephen hilt had

67
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,280
both been consultants doing control

68
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,720
system security in the past

69
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,239
so we used some of that knowledge we

70
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:56,480
also had some help from thomas van

71
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:57,200
norman

72
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,200
who provided us some other values that

73
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,120
we weren't 100 sure of

74
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:04,720
and we set it up such that

75
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:07,040
our system looked realistic when you

76
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,640
turned on the process heater

77
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:11,040
it didn't automatically go you know from

78
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,000
room temperature

79
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,120
to 400 degrees fahrenheit

80
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,280
when you turn on a conveyor belt it

81
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,680
slowly started ramping up

82
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:23,360
and we wanted that that realism in there

83
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,239
such that

84
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:25,840
somebody who kind of knows what they're

85
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,440
doing or knows what they're doing as far

86
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,720
as control systems

87
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,319
isn't just going to say oh that's you

88
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:32,480
know you're full of it

89
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:36,239
it's obviously fake so one of the things

90
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:36,720
that

91
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:41,120
that lord had to do was create a

92
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,840
some logic and one of those was being

93
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:44,799
was a

94
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:48,080
random number generator some of the

95
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,480
plc's had random number generators built

96
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,200
in

97
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:55,839
other ones did not and we had to

98
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,680
program those in in order to get some of

99
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:00,080
those those minor fluctuations

100
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:03,439
in temperature and the speed of the

101
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:08,239
uh the conveyor belt to work properly

102
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,760
so another device or another system that

103
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:12,400
we had on

104
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,640
on our network was a robotics

105
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:15,599
workstation

106
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:16,959
and it's actually the first workstation

107
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:20,639
that we exposed to the internet

108
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:24,080
the other one eventually was the hmi

109
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,199
that we exposed

110
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:26,400
but we started with the robotics

111
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,800
workstation because it was a slightly

112
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,960
lower value target

113
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:34,240
it also was a system

114
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,720
that was designed to control the

115
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:39,440
palletizer

116
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:43,280
so next we opened up some of the ports

117
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:46,960
to our system and

118
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:50,000
those being the micrologix the omron

119
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,720
siemens and then we had a couple of vnc

120
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:53,600
ports

121
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:57,840
that we opened up eventually on our

122
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:01,360
on our hmi as well as on the robotics

123
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,520
workstation

124
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:06,639
the we decided to use vnc

125
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:10,560
instead of rdp because

126
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,880
vnc was a lot easier to monitor through

127
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:13,919
pcapps

128
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:15,440
we were able to analyze the data a lot

129
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:18,160
better you could see

130
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,479
clear text passwords being entered in or

131
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:21,520
tried

132
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:22,960
we were able to get a lot more data out

133
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,560
of vnc than we

134
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:28,000
than we were out of rdp

135
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:31,759
so we then set up our company and we put

136
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:34,240
some real addresses out there

137
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:37,039
we found a couple incubators that were

138
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:38,400
good for industrial

139
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:41,520
startups and

140
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:44,160
so you can see we mapped out a couple of

141
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:44,960
the different

142
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:47,120
businesses one of them being in

143
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,800
chattanooga the other one being in los

144
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:52,240
angeles and if you go on google maps you

145
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,400
can find you know some images of those

146
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,759
buildings

147
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:58,800
and uh so if somebody were to do a deep

148
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,880
dive to see if we were a real factory it

149
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,319
would look more like we were

150
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:06,400
a real factory uh small but real

151
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:10,240
we then set up some

152
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:13,120
dns entries for different locations one

153
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,560
of them being our factory another one

154
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,080
being our our

155
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:20,400
vpn and another one being our website

156
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:23,440
um so we had all those set up

157
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:26,880
so uh if somebody were to

158
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,639
again investigate us further they would

159
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:30,639
see that that we have a few different

160
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:32,479
dns entries out there

161
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:35,919
and maybe start poking around on some of

162
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:39,120
the other ips that we had

163
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,680
next we went to this person does not

164
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:42,960
exist.com

165
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:45,680
and we created a number of employees we

166
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,600
had four employees total

167
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,520
the first one being mike wilson who was

168
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,280
kind of our chief maker

169
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:54,000
and he was also he ended up being our it

170
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:54,720
guy

171
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:57,919
uh and we'll talk a bit more about him

172
00:06:57,919 --> 00:06:58,720
later

173
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:02,000
we also had jans fisher who was our

174
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,520
our engineer we had emily clark

175
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:09,039
who was our three 3d modeler

176
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:12,160
and stephen murphy who is our safety

177
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:15,039
guy so

178
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,360
another thing that we did is is we set

179
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,280
up a

180
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:23,199
voip phone number such that

181
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:24,720
if somebody wanted to get in contact

182
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:27,120
with us they were able to

183
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:30,560
call in and we had an automated

184
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,000
receptionist

185
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,759
and extensions to all the different

186
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:35,919
employees

187
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:38,000
the company that we used was ring yu

188
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,680
which is a

189
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:42,400
friend of one of my colleagues he set us

190
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,440
up with that

191
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,759
and you know so we're thankful for for

192
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:48,400
that hookup

193
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,520
next we set up all the monitoring on the

194
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:52,879
system

195
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:55,440
one of the the really cool things with

196
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,440
virtualbox is that it allows you to do

197
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:00,560
video recording of the screen and we use

198
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,400
those video recordings to

199
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,879
basically watch what our attackers did

200
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:06,560
to our system

201
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:10,240
it was extremely helpful way to monitor

202
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:13,360
this the system outside of having some

203
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,039
you know some kind of trip wire

204
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:17,199
installed or having

205
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:21,120
uh uh other kind of file monitor

206
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,319
installed

207
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:25,520
and it also allowed us to get deeper

208
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:29,520
than just looking through the p-caps

209
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:32,958
the next we had a couple four taps that

210
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:33,839
we used

211
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:36,000
these were from shark tap and they were

212
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,519
just ethernet

213
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:42,399
taps they worked really well for us

214
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:43,599
captured everything i don't think there

215
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:46,959
was any drop packets that we saw

216
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:50,000
so this is what our final network looked

217
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:50,320
like

218
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:53,360
we have the hmi the engineering

219
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,160
workstation

220
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,600
and the robotic workstation on the left

221
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:58,320
hand side those are all vms running on a

222
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,399
laptop

223
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:03,200
we have the plc's kind of in the right

224
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,640
center

225
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:07,600
all hooked up and we had taps across

226
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,160
pretty much

227
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,320
all of that and they were all going into

228
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,760
a raspberry pi

229
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,279
the raspberry pi would collect all that

230
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:15,360
data and then it would

231
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:18,399
forward that on to a another server that

232
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:20,000
we had to process all those p

233
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,440
caps and for that we used moloch

234
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:28,560
molok is a aol product it's up on github

235
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:32,080
free to use and it worked really well

236
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:36,000
allowed us to visualize our pcaps

237
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,120
do traces monitor the the the full

238
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,680
conversations we could extract files out

239
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:44,800
worked really well for our purposes

240
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:48,240
it is typically set up for

241
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,240
live capture but you can also just

242
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,480
upload pcaps to it too and it will work

243
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,320
like that as well

244
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,920
another thing that we did was we set up

245
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,440
a bunch of scripts

246
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,200
that would go through and process our

247
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,680
pcaps and just give us

248
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:04,000
kind of generic data you know who was

249
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,279
talking to who

250
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:08,320
every day how much data was being

251
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,079
transferred

252
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:13,760
you know the country of origin

253
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:17,040
stuff like that and that just kind of

254
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:19,360
helped us keep ahead of what was going

255
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,200
on or keep up with what was going on in

256
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,720
our system

257
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:25,600
um so now we get to the fun stuff what

258
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,360
happened on our system

259
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:31,279
uh a lot happened

260
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:35,360
and you'll see that there's actually a

261
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,600
couple gaps here the first one being the

262
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,120
time that we went live to the time that

263
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,399
we had an attack

264
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:43,200
and then you'll also see a gap uh kind

265
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,079
of after the first

266
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:46,959
ransomware attack that we had into

267
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:48,800
resetting the virtual machines and kind

268
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:49,360
of going

269
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:52,000
going live again so we're going to break

270
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:52,560
these down

271
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:55,920
into two larger sections the

272
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:59,920
section just after we started up until

273
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:01,440
the reset and then

274
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:04,800
the section after the reset

275
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:08,560
so on may 6th we went live

276
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:12,079
we didn't have we had our i think we had

277
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:13,680
our vnc turned off

278
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:18,160
at that time and then

279
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,839
nobody was really doing anything with

280
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:21,760
our systems they were just

281
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:24,399
looking at there were some scanners out

282
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:26,320
there automated scanners that were

283
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:29,680
picking up our plcs but nothing happened

284
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:30,560
so then we

285
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:33,760
we put vnc on

286
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:36,320
opened up that port but we made the vnc

287
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,600
read only

288
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,920
and we were hoping that somebody would

289
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:41,600
exploit it we would get something cool

290
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:42,640
out of it

291
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,959
that didn't happen so after a few more

292
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:45,920
weeks

293
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:49,760
we opened up vnc on our robotics

294
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:50,880
workstation

295
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:54,000
and we allowed people to do

296
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,519
right access to it so they had read

297
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:57,200
write access to

298
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:00,160
that system and read only access to our

299
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:02,719
hmi

300
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:06,160
we also started posting some information

301
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:08,160
on paste bin trying to leave little

302
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,360
nuggets

303
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,279
that our system was out there didn't

304
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:12,959
really see anything

305
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:16,320
come of that though so our first attack

306
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,600
that we saw

307
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:20,639
was a malware

308
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:23,360
installation and what happened there was

309
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:24,240
somebody

310
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,560
came onto our system and they dropped

311
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:28,240
this host.exe

312
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:31,760
which was uh it's a version of aries

313
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:35,120
c2 which is available on github we were

314
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,320
excited

315
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:39,600
somebody finally attacked us and looking

316
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:40,880
through the file

317
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,800
looking at everything it ended up just

318
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,480
being a monero miner

319
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:47,519
so kind of lame

320
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:50,959
uh so next what happened we had a bunch

321
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:52,399
of

322
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:55,440
minor things that came up we had

323
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:59,040
uh some phone fraud some

324
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:05,600
people go turning on rdp on our system

325
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:09,200
minor issues that we didn't really uh

326
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,040
we looked at it didn't really dive too

327
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,560
deep into it there was also people who

328
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:12,959
liked

329
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:15,600
to log off of our system for whatever

330
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:16,639
reason they just

331
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:20,399
didn't like us having a system online

332
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:23,760
then we get to our ransomware

333
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:27,200
and this ransomware

334
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:31,920
occurs in towards the end of september

335
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:35,120
and what we see is uh somebody finally

336
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,160
logs into our system

337
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:39,360
installs some ransomware on it we start

338
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,440
and oh and we determined that it was a

339
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,880
crisis variant

340
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,880
so we started talking to them they

341
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,399
wanted ten thousand dollars

342
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:50,160
to uh decrypt everything

343
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,639
we negotiated them down to about six

344
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:54,240
thousand dollars

345
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:57,040
and we wanted proof that they were

346
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,560
actually able to

347
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,880
go ahead and and decrypt all the files

348
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:02,160
that they had encrypted

349
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,839
so they had said that we could send them

350
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:07,360
one file but it had to be

351
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:10,720
an unimportant file so we went with

352
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:14,560
a we went with one of the

353
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:17,519
config files with all of the logic for

354
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:18,320
our

355
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:22,560
i think it was for our omron and

356
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:24,160
to see if they knew what they were

357
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:26,000
dealing with when it comes to

358
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
control systems so we sent them that

359
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,199
file

360
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:31,120
and they decrypted it and sent us back

361
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,480
so they sent us back a pretty high

362
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,160
priority file

363
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:36,560
indicating they didn't really know what

364
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:37,199
they were

365
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:38,959
what they were dealing with when it

366
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:42,000
comes to factories

367
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:46,320
we let that kind of play on for

368
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:49,600
a week or so and then eventually we

369
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:53,680
uh we did a reset on our virtual machine

370
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:55,760
uh set everything back to zero

371
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,040
essentially

372
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:01,599
and waited for for new attacks

373
00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:04,800
so the next attack that we had was the

374
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:05,360
what we

375
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:08,399
called the not so advanced attack and

376
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:10,320
it was funny to watch this because the

377
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,240
person went out they downloaded

378
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:15,680
uh an installer

379
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:19,360
and it was called shell.exe and they got

380
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:19,920
a

381
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:23,120
warning from windows saying that it

382
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:23,920
could harm your

383
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:25,680
your computer if if you're allowed if

384
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,760
you open this up

385
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,240
and instead of just saying you know

386
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,839
selecting the actions and saying open

387
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:32,959
anyway

388
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:36,480
they when tried to

389
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,720
disable defender and then they try to

390
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:41,519
download the file again and

391
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:45,040
same issue then they completely

392
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:48,959
turned off defender and

393
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:50,560
they still weren't quite able to get it

394
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:53,680
installed eventually they were able to

395
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:56,079
get get it installed through powershell

396
00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:59,359
but it took him a little bit of time

397
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:02,720
and at the end the

398
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:06,959
guy had put up a nasty note to mike

399
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:10,480
all right kind of our it guy and calling

400
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:11,839
mike an idiot

401
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:14,720
and that he had been connected for 10

402
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:15,600
days

403
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,560
and that he had i think looking through

404
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:19,839
our logs he had

405
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:22,800
taken about 13 gigs worth of our phony

406
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,880
data

407
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:27,600
so no big loss but he was kind of mean

408
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:28,480
to mike

409
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:33,440
so the next thing that we had

410
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:36,240
we had a couple ics attacks but they

411
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:37,199
weren't

412
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:40,160
very critical somebody started up our

413
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:40,880
factory

414
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:43,120
a couple times didn't really do anything

415
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:46,320
to it but they started it up

416
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:50,240
we did have and that was after we had

417
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,519
switched

418
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:55,360
our vnc from uh

419
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:58,480
read-only on the hmi to read and write

420
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:01,279
on the hmi

421
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:05,919
so next we had a what we call the good

422
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:07,839
guy hacker

423
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:11,359
and this nice person came in

424
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:15,119
and wrote on our system that

425
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:18,240
he had found our pc

426
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:21,520
online and that anybody could connect to

427
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:22,799
it

428
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:26,079
and that somebody a hacker might do bad

429
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:26,640
things

430
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,160
if they were allowed to connect to the

431
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:30,080
system and

432
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:32,880
that we should really secure our vnc at

433
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,559
least put a password on it

434
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:36,960
or you know something else it was really

435
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:37,840
nice of him

436
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:40,720
we appreciate it

437
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:45,440
and then we had

438
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:48,160
something called uh ransomware 2. it was

439
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,039
another

440
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:53,120
crisis variant

441
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:57,760
the next we had something that just is

442
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:58,400
really

443
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:02,320
really weird and we have no idea

444
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:04,720
what the people were doing why they were

445
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:05,679
doing it

446
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:08,400
if anybody has any good idea please let

447
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,280
me know

448
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:11,280
but they went through and installed a

449
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:12,320
nokia

450
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:15,679
emulator on our system

451
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:19,280
so they get access to our system

452
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:21,280
they go out and they download from

453
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:23,039
github uh

454
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:26,880
symbian os emulator

455
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:30,080
they go and download java as well as

456
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:33,280
perl they install all of the java and

457
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:34,240
perl

458
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:37,440
and then set up the symbian

459
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:42,320
os and then they browse to google

460
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:45,760
and that's it they then

461
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:47,919
uh what did they do they they deleted

462
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:50,480
some of the java they deleted the pearl

463
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:55,679
and they removed the the nokia simulator

464
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:59,280
and that was it so we're still

465
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:01,520
at a loss if you have any suggestions or

466
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:03,600
any

467
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:07,280
explanation please let us know

468
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:11,679
one of the other things that we saw uh

469
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:14,960
was what we called rename ware and this

470
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,720
was a really

471
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:20,160
kind of odd attack because what happened

472
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:20,559
is

473
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:23,360
the person it's kind of lame attack the

474
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:24,000
person logged

475
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,280
into our system and

476
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:30,960
started using this script it was a

477
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:33,760
a batch file and the script goes through

478
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:34,559
and it

479
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:38,080
just renames everything

480
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:41,039
in a directory so it i think it renamed

481
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:41,600
it

482
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:46,080
you know filename.crypt

483
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:48,320
and we were actually watching this

484
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:49,440
person

485
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:55,200
live on our system and we saw that the

486
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,360
the script that the person was using to

487
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:58,320
do

488
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:02,000
this inc encryption with had

489
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,200
accidentally renamed the script

490
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:08,240
and so we saw the person

491
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:11,280
go through remove the dot

492
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:13,440
crypt from the end change it back to dot

493
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:14,720
bat

494
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:18,840
and then continue on encrypting our

495
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:21,440
files

496
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:24,480
so we determined we looked at

497
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,960
what the file had had in it in its uh

498
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:27,840
contents

499
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:30,400
and determined that all it was was just

500
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,760
you know rename

501
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:37,919
star dot whatever to star.crypt

502
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:43,600
it was poorly done but

503
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:46,720
could be effective i guess and the

504
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:47,600
person left

505
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,840
a note on our screen they wanted a few

506
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:51,200
hundred dollars

507
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,360
to decrypt it however they didn't

508
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:54,400
provide any

509
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:55,840
email address so we couldn't contact

510
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:57,919
them we couldn't talk to them

511
00:20:57,919 --> 00:21:01,679
and all they left was a

512
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:05,520
bitcoin wallet for us to pay into about

513
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:09,200
four or five days later after

514
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:12,000
we didn't pay them they came back they

515
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:12,880
deleted

516
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:15,840
a bunch of our files and then they set

517
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:16,080
up

518
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:18,880
our system such that on startup it would

519
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:20,240
open up a bunch of

520
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:23,200
adult websites

521
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:27,600
so the last event i'm going to talk

522
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:28,559
about is something that actually

523
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:29,520
happened

524
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:33,039
fairly early on and this was when

525
00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:36,960
viz also known as dan tentler

526
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:39,360
got onto or found our system found our

527
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:40,480
honeypot

528
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:44,480
and was convinced that it was a real

529
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:47,039
factory that was exposed online he

530
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:47,520
started

531
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:50,559
a an ics cert case

532
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:54,240
and uh

533
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:58,320
one of a friend of of stephen and myself

534
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:01,760
mike tucker had was contacted

535
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:03,360
he was looking through the system he

536
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:05,600
noticed that there was an omron on there

537
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:08,960
and mike reached out to

538
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:11,120
steven on our team who has a lot of

539
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:12,000
experience with with

540
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,919
omrons and we you know told mike that no

541
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:17,760
this is actually our honeypot

542
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:20,400
that's out there that shouldn't go any

543
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:20,960
further

544
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:23,039
it doesn't need to be an actual ics cert

545
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:25,280
case

546
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:28,159
contacted a couple other people and

547
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:30,080
eventually got on the phone with viz

548
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:33,039
trying to show him that this is in fact

549
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:34,000
a honey pot

550
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,880
you know and it took a bit of convincing

551
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:38,240
we actually had to

552
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:42,960
write on the screen hello viz or hi-viz

553
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:47,039
and you know to show him that this was

554
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:49,919
actually our system

555
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:54,480
viz then sent an email a bit later

556
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:57,840
to icsert and a couple other people

557
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:59,600
that were involved saying that it was

558
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,120
the most elaborate honeypot

559
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:04,320
that he's ever seen and

560
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:07,600
later on on twitter posted that have you

561
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:08,640
ever learned a thing

562
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,240
you know where the immediate outcome has

563
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:12,240
been i need rum like

564
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:16,159
right now so it's kind of a win for us

565
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:20,080
um so the next part i'd like to go into

566
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:22,480
is a little bit of the statistics as far

567
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:23,520
as

568
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:26,480
who was visiting our system and kind of

569
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:28,720
where the traffic was originating from

570
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:32,000
so this first picture you'll see is

571
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,960
all of the traffic that our system had

572
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:36,960
externally so anytime there was an

573
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:39,440
external communication so either from

574
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:41,520
our system to someplace else or from

575
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:44,720
someplace else to our system that was

576
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:47,360
the data that we were looking at

577
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:50,559
and the majority of it was in the u.s

578
00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:53,679
uh quite a bit in russia

579
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:58,320
canada was pretty high as well china

580
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:01,360
and then if you look through on the next

581
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:01,840
page

582
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:06,000
we have just the robotic workstation and

583
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,039
the hmi

584
00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:10,159
and that's pretty much the same

585
00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:12,400
data because most of our data was

586
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,720
actually on the robotic workstation or

587
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:17,440
the hmi

588
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:20,960
the next set of data is pretty much

589
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:21,919
everything from

590
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:25,279
the plcs so it didn't matter which plc

591
00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:27,919
we uh this is kind of an aggregate of

592
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:29,919
all the different plcs so russia

593
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:31,760
china a little bit from india some from

594
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:33,279
japan

595
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:37,279
and canada and the the us

596
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:40,159
now one thing that was interesting was

597
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:41,039
looking at

598
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:43,600
the individual plcs so if we look here

599
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,440
at the s7

600
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:48,799
we see china and japan

601
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:50,799
as well as the us and canada were pretty

602
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:54,400
big russia was a little less so

603
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:56,559
then we have the micrologix which is

604
00:24:56,559 --> 00:24:57,600
pretty much

605
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:01,679
the us a little bit of canada a bit more

606
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:04,880
in in china and

607
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:08,000
a little bit in russia

608
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,039
a little bit in the uk

609
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:15,200
and the interesting one that i found was

610
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:17,520
that there's a lot going to the omron or

611
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:20,559
a lot of omron going from uh

612
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:24,720
japan and china as well as the us

613
00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:27,279
so let's look at a little bit of stats

614
00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:30,400
here and we see that the

615
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:34,240
total number of unique ips

616
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:38,159
was around 8 900 ips

617
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:42,320
of those we found about almost 600

618
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:45,120
ips that we could easily determine that

619
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:45,919
were

620
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:49,679
from scanners

621
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,279
that left about 8 300

622
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:56,480
unique ips that were not from

623
00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:01,360
known scanners then we have

624
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:04,960
the unique ips per day

625
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:08,880
and so

626
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:11,279
the reason that the unique ips per day

627
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:12,159
is different

628
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:14,080
than the unique ips that we saw in the

629
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:17,840
previous slide is that these are

630
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:21,120
if 1.1.1.1 connected to us

631
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:24,320
on a tuesday and then that same ip

632
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:25,200
connected to us

633
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:29,440
on a thursday this is going to count

634
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:32,799
both of them because this is uh

635
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:36,320
kind of unique ips per day

636
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:40,400
or unique sessions i should say so

637
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:43,039
on this previous slide you'll see it was

638
00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:46,000
if 1.1.1.1 connected to us

639
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,159
just once that would be counted in that

640
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:49,679
80

641
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:53,039
8900 amount so

642
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:56,400
what we see here is about 85

643
00:26:56,400 --> 00:27:00,320
unique ips per day and

644
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:04,159
we had about 10 unique scanner ips per

645
00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:04,720
day

646
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:05,840
and they would be from all different

647
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:08,799
types of sources we see showdan

648
00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:13,200
ipip a few other ones that were that are

649
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,600
out there

650
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:19,520
so the amount of data that we had was

651
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:23,440
pretty high as well we had over 55

652
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:26,960
or 550 million packets were sent into

653
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:28,480
and out of our system

654
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:35,520
and we had about 12 or 126.7gb

655
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:38,960
that that left our system i think it was

656
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:41,200
actually

657
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:44,159
external data transfer was about just

658
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:46,399
under 30 gigs

659
00:27:46,399 --> 00:27:48,080
there was some internal data transfer

660
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:50,480
that was happening as well

661
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:53,120
especially when people were looking and

662
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:54,000
going through

663
00:27:54,000 --> 00:28:03,039
the files on in inside of our network

664
00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:05,120
so a couple tips if you want to run your

665
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:06,320
own honeypot

666
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:08,880
uh remove any virtual machine

667
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:10,960
identifiers so going through

668
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:12,880
the registry looking for anything that

669
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:14,159
says virtualbox or

670
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:17,440
vmware or hyper-v

671
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:18,720
just make sure that all of that is

672
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:20,720
removed make sure you don't have the

673
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:22,799
guest add-ons installed

674
00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:27,520
that's a big key identifier

675
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:29,600
virtualbox for screen recording was

676
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,679
amazing let us create all those really

677
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:32,799
cool videos

678
00:28:32,799 --> 00:28:34,480
and actually see what people were doing

679
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:36,000
on our system

680
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,399
you need to have good file and network

681
00:28:38,399 --> 00:28:39,360
forensics

682
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:42,080
for us we use the virtualbox screen

683
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:43,440
recording as our

684
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:45,760
main indicator for what files had been

685
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:47,279
accessed

686
00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:50,480
again vnc worked really well

687
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:51,919
for this purpose because we could see

688
00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:54,080
what people were typing in

689
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:56,880
there were a couple of vnc key

690
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:58,000
keyloggers that you could

691
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,760
use and we didn't want anything

692
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:01,039
installed on

693
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:03,360
our virtual machines so we wanted to do

694
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:05,520
everything

695
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:07,679
you know either over the network or

696
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:09,279
through the virtualbox

697
00:29:09,279 --> 00:29:12,000
screen recording and then make your

698
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,120
target interesting

699
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:15,360
it should be something that attackers

700
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:16,480
want to go after

701
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:18,000
and that was one of the reasons why we

702
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,760
chose a factory we had seen

703
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:21,600
uh previous attacks we wanted to see

704
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:22,799
more attacks

705
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:24,720
and see what what the attackers were

706
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:27,039
going after and how knowledgeable they

707
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:27,360
were

708
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:29,039
of of the systems that they were

709
00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:30,720
attacking

710
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:32,480
it turned out for the most part they

711
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:34,159
they weren't all that

712
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:37,440
knowledgeable about the systems

713
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:39,840
so in conclusion if you want to run a

714
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:41,919
high interaction honey pot

715
00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:44,880
you need to monitor it daily it's

716
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,399
something you have to pay attention to

717
00:29:46,399 --> 00:29:46,880
you have to

718
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:49,440
you have to watch it and deal with

719
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,080
incidents

720
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:52,880
as soon as they happen don't wait

721
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:54,320
because otherwise the incidents just

722
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:56,480
kind of pile up on top of each other

723
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:59,120
and eventually your honeypot will simply

724
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:01,600
collapse

725
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:04,880
and the attackers seem to be a lot more

726
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:06,960
interested in having a clean ip to go

727
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:08,240
out and do something

728
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:11,279
we had more you know frauds

729
00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:14,480
and and uh kind of other miscellaneous

730
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:14,960
events

731
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:18,000
happen than we did you know proper

732
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,440
uh ransomware

733
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:24,960
host infections so that it seemed like

734
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:26,640
they were mostly just going after

735
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:29,440
a clean ip

736
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:32,880
don't put your control system on the

737
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:34,080
internet ever

738
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:36,880
just don't do it and it's striking to

739
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:37,200
see

740
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:40,880
how um how many

741
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,720
control systems are are available out

742
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:44,000
there just

743
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,559
it's a bad idea don't do it and

744
00:30:46,559 --> 00:30:47,600
attackers are going to be

745
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:50,240
mean to mike and they will hurt mike's

746
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:51,279
feelings

747
00:30:51,279 --> 00:30:55,440
so yeah be prepared to have people yell

748
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:57,039
at you for being an idiot for having

749
00:30:57,039 --> 00:30:57,360
your

750
00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:00,158
system online

751
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:03,600
i would ask a couple

752
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:07,279
favors if anybody is interested

753
00:31:07,279 --> 00:31:10,399
in running a honeypot with us

754
00:31:10,399 --> 00:31:12,640
as far as a control system or ics style

755
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:13,519
honeypot

756
00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:15,360
please let us know we're looking for

757
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:16,840
other people to

758
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:21,360
uh proper asset owners to get

759
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:25,440
to talk to and try to run an actual

760
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:28,960
uh you know honey pot within their

761
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:29,919
