to discuss the latest research trends

12
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:36,320
and best practices

13
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:39,440
is vital while our event is entirely

14
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:41,280
online this year the blackout team

15
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:42,879

00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:00,079
from the global community

24
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:01,280
outside of our trainings and our

25
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:03,520
briefings programs we have a

26

00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:01,600
this is the first year we've done this

54
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,840
virtually since the year 2000 when we

55
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,520
started coming to singapore

56
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,759
and so i'd like to welcome you and i'd

going online

60
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:15,440
so who am i i'm jeff moss i'm the

61
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:16,560
founder of black hat

62
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,319
and i'd like to welcome you and give you

63
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:20,480
a little bit of our history

64
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:21,599
for those of you who are new in the

65
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:23,520
audience we do a couple of things before

66
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,480
we kick off

67
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,640
and i introduce the keynote i want to

68
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:27,680
talk a little bit about

69
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,280
who's in the audience and then i want to

70
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,120
talk a little bit about what we do

71
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,720
to try to grow the audience and the

72
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,560
diversity and then give you a couple

73
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:35,360
thoughts

74
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,120
about where i think things are going to

75
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,959
sort of frame the talks and the

76
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:40,160
conversations that we'll be

77
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:43,200
having over the next two days so let's

78
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,879
kick this off

79
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:46,480
who's in the audience we have

80
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:48,400
representatives from 112

81
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,959
different countries and out of those 112

82
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:53,040
countries we have representatives from

83
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:56,560
28 countries with only a single person

84
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:59,120
and so i normally read through the list

85
00:02:59,120 --> 00:02:59,680
call out

86
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,879
give kudos to those who are there

87
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:04,480
shouldering the burden of being the sole

88
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:07,120
person representing their culture

89
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,280
and virtually now you can maybe raise

90
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,120
your hand virtually during a break

91
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:14,000
and say hey i'm from palau anybody else

92
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,680
from a nearby country

93
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,519
and try to network try to meet some of

94
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:19,519
your peers from around the region

95
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:23,040
and grow your connections so here we go

96
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:27,040
albania algeria angola

97
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:30,480
armenia azerbaijan the bahamas

98

uruguay

105
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:56,879
venezuela last but not least zimbabwe

106
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:59,200
so thank you for making the trek

107
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,560
digitally all this way

108
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:04,879
and getting involved second part is

109
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:06,560
we really do try to get more people

110
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,239
involved every year and starting about

111
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:09,760
five years ago black hat

112
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:12,560
started a program of offering free

113
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:13,519
admission

114
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:16,959
to those who qualified students teachers

115
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:19,358
military veterans and we've extended

116
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:21,199
that program this year and continued it

117
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:23,040
for singapore

118
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,280
so we have scholarships that we've given

119
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,280
away to 75 students

120
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,880
to attend that wouldn't normally have

121
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,720
the financial means to get into a black

122
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,400
hat until maybe further along in their

123
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,280
career

124
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,960
but we really want to try to grow that

125
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,560
next generation

126
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,960
also we have 35 women in security

127
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,320
scholarships

128
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:43,120
trying to increase gender diversity 10

129
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,199
educator scholarships

130
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:48,800
and 25 passes donated to the singapore

131
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,360
cyber security agency for their career

132
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:54,160
mentoring program

133
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:58,240
so why is diversity so important well

134
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:01,039
global perspectives are going to become

135
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:01,759
key

136
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:03,120
in the direction of technology in the

137
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,840
next decade and why is this well

138
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,600
people are saying that the 2020s to the

139
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,240
2030s is the decade of tech now we've

140
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,080
heard that since the dot-com bubble but

141
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,680
what's different here is we're on

142
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,160
a threshold of several breakthroughs of

143
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,919
technology

144
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:19,280
you know the explosive growth and

145
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,840
computing power has led to ml and ai

146
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,440
breakthroughs and this will continue

147
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:26,080
with moore's law in the next decade

148
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:29,199
so expect more consequence more impact

149
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:31,759
from ai and ml

150
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:33,919
we're going to have more in bio

151
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:35,280
breakthroughs

152
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,440
don't forget robot breakthroughs and

153
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,400
then there's going to be

154
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:41,520
something going on in quantum computing

155
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:45,680
and uh for 5g 6g

156
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,280
what's happening here is as the

157
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,520
technology spreads around the globe and

158
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:50,639
becomes more

159
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:53,440
important in everybody's lives

160
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:54,880
governments are going to be looking to

161
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:55,360
us

162
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,919
to try to interpret the risks and

163
00:05:57,919 --> 00:05:59,199
provide advice

164
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:00,560
on the security around these

165
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,240
technologies

166
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:05,120
and something i'm fond of saying is that

167
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,360
internet problems are global problems

168
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:10,080
and this is really a reflection that if

169
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:10,720
there's

170
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:14,080
an attack in one country it might impact

171
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:14,639
routing

172
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:16,960
for other countries if one country does

173
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,400
a bgp hijack

174
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,479
it might suck in traffic from a third

175
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:22,240
uninvolved party

176
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,240
and to resolve these conflicts and these

177
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,240
tensions you're gonna have to have

178
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,680
conversations with people

179
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,680
in countries other than your own you're

180
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,440
gonna have to understand other cultures

181
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:34,960
other languages and so therefore i think

182
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:37,120
a more diverse cyber security population

183
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,960
will only benefit us going forward

184
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:41,680
only benefit companies and help us

185
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,360
understand how the technology is being

186
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,120
used

187
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,759
but there's a corollary to this which is

188
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:49,440
global problems are now

189
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,680
internet problems the tensions between

190
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,680
states have bled over to the internet

191
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,520
and this became really obvious in the

192
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:58,720
2016 election in the united states

193
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:02,720
russia really took it to america online

194
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,479
instead of sort of behind the scenes or

195
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:06,400
diplomatically or through economic

196
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:07,120
sanctions

197
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,360
it became really an online internet

198
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,560
problem

199
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:13,599
and as other countries learn from that

200
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:16,639
you see the techniques used by russia

201
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:19,120
disinformation information operations

202
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,240
multiplying

203
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,000
this is just going to be a constant

204
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,199
background to the world we live in

205
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:28,960
add on top of that supply chain issues

206
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:31,360
and the immediacy of any time there's a

207
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,240
global issue

208
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:35,039
pandemic fires in california there's

209
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:36,160
phishing campaigns

210
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:41,039
ready to roll botnets globally deployed

211
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:45,039
so i think in the past maybe the

212
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:46,560
technology and security problems are

213
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,039
very

214
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:49,599
stovepipe very limited going forward

215
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:51,680
they're going to become much more global

216
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,319
and because of that policymakers or

217
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:56,160
companies are really going to turn to us

218
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,319
to provide sort of a third party or more

219
00:07:58,319 --> 00:07:59,680
of an independent perspective

220
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,919
what does this all mean how do we design

221
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:03,039
our product

222
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:05,520
to comply with the gdpr what are the

223
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:06,639
security risks of

224
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:08,720
housing all of our pii inside china if

225
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:11,039
we want to do business there

226
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:14,319
so i think that's key

227
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:15,919
and at the same time we're just

228
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:17,919
discovering a new form

229
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:19,680
of diplomacy which i'm calling app

230
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,039
diplomacy

231
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:22,639
and this is a reflection of recent

232
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:24,080
conflict on the indian

233
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:28,319
china border between china and india

234
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:30,720
where some indian military were killed

235
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,000
in a conflict

236
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,240
and india could have decided to respond

237
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,679
by escalating

238
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:38,399
but instead they de-escalated and went

239
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:38,958
to an

240
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:41,519
economic response by banning bite

241
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:42,640
dance's tick-tock

242
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:45,760
application on the indian app store

243
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:48,720
so this becomes an economic response

244
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,080
nuanced in that it's

245
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:52,480
through to an app and had a six billion

246
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,640
dollar market cap

247
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:57,839
consequence so real economic pain

248
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:00,240
lateral thinking sort of asymmetric and

249
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,000
response

250
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,640
great didn't involve blowing things up

251
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,320
but on the other hand

252
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:09,200
it's now a new way for companies and

253
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,560
countries to respond

254
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,000
don't like your economic competitor

255
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,839
maybe you pull their app

256
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:15,839
want country a doesn't like country b

257
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:18,240
ban some of their apps from your store

258
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,240
and this has the impact of fragmenting

259
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,680
the internet

260
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:24,080
so i can predict confidently

261
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,120
unfortunately

262
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,640
that the future will hold a more

263
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,880
fragmented internet

264
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,880
and a more fragmented internet while it

265
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:34,000
doesn't serve anybody's best interest

266
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,320
it's really convenient and attractive

267
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,080
for a number of reasons

268
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,080
one is you sort of know who your friends

269
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,399
are in a fragmented internet

270
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:43,920
you could say we're the rule of law

271
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,839
countries and those are the

272
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:47,440
authoritarian countries

273
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,519
and it's really convenient for sorting

274
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:50,480
who your friends and

275
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:53,839
enemies may be right well

276
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:55,839
while that's convenient that's maybe not

277
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:57,200
the best for

278
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:00,640
world peace and efficiency and an open

279
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,959
free and interactive internet but that's

280
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:04,320
the world we're going in and that's the

281
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,640
world we're going to be operating in

282
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:09,600
and so i want you to just take a minute

283
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,519
and think about that

284
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:15,279
um you're going to intentionally or

285
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:16,640
unintentionally over the next four or

286
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:17,279
five years

287
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:20,160
end up picking sides you're going to

288
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,079
find yourself naturally gravitating more

289
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:23,839
toward platforms that are maybe more

290
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:27,440
open or maybe more controlling

291
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,720
you're going to be working for a company

292
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,800
that's building technology maybe to

293
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:33,040
surveil and potentially repress people

294
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:35,040
with facial recognition

295
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:37,200
or create profiles or maybe you're

296
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,959
working for companies

297
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:40,320
like a microsoft that says we're not

298
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,240
doing facial recognition anymore

299
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,399
right so you're going to end up working

300
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:46,000
for companies or governments that

301
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:46,959
reflect

302
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:50,480
your moral values or maybe not

303
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,560
maybe you just don't care right maybe

304
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,000
you want to be like switzerland and not

305
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,600
pick a side

306
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:58,079
not picking is also picking by the way

307
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:01,040
that's not an escape valve for you

308
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:04,079
so when you're doing this just don't

309
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:04,800
forget

310
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:08,959
that the companies and the governments

311
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:10,399
and the way you've made your decisions

312
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:12,560
will greatly influence the internet of

313
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,160
the future the internet our children

314
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:15,040
inherit

315
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,480
and if you fragment the internet too

316
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:19,120
much in the next few years

317
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,800
our children will grow up in a world

318
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,320
that is not like our world

319
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,079
right you fight too much online on the

320
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:26,320
internet and the isps

321
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,320
and the carriers will we'll redesign the

322
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,079
internet to be more safe

323
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:31,920
but in doing so it'll be fundamentally

324
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,440
different than the internet we have

325
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,560
today

326
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:37,760
so keep that in mind

327
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,560
i would like to uh to also talk a little

328
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,240
bit about why i'm so excited about

329
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:45,839
singapore as a location for black hat

330
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:48,160
and i was excited this way 20 years ago

331
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,519
but a little bit more now

332
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:52,800
for a number of reasons one singapore

333
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,240
really has a commitment to the rule of

334
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,000
law and that's led to a couple

335
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,720
of outcomes i believe one is they're a

336
00:11:58,720 --> 00:11:59,920
big routing

337
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:02,160
superpower in southeast asia if you look

338
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:03,120
at a map

339
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,680
of where all the fiber terminates and a

340
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,040
ton of it transits through

341
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:09,839
singapore because of that there's more

342
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:11,120
and more data centers here

343
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:13,440
it's becoming sort of a data haven that

344
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,320
rule of law

345
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,360
provides a certain amount of

346
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,120
transparency and predictability that

347
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,320
allows companies

348
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:21,120
to invest and because of that singapore

349
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,800
also has one of the highest

350
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:26,000
educated populations is very quick to

351
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:26,800
adapt

352
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,160
they're a big exporter of high

353
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:30,240
technology so i think

354
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,720
they're suited very well to become an

355
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,720
influencer in the area

356
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:37,680
they're not like in america or china or

357
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:38,480
germany

358
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,160
where their market power is so great it

359
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:41,600
can swing things

360
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,839
but what they can do is provide sort of

361
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:47,120
a moral guidance on where this all leads

362
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:49,519
and so that's why i'm really excited to

363
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:50,160
introduce

364
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:53,600
our keynote speaker so for day one

365
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,680
our keynote speaker is brigadier general

366
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,839
gurov kirthi

367
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:00,480
he's also known as yoda he was a former

368
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:01,680
air force pilot

369
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,680
and in the military he has also held

370
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:05,120
roles in

371
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:08,480
capability development innovation

372
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,480
and in his final tour of duty he's

373
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,000
responsible for the cyber defense of the

374
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
air force

375
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,920
as deputy chief executive development

376
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:20,560
in the cyber security agency or the csa

377
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,320
gurov oversees the cybersecurity

378
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,560
capability and ecosystem development

379
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,959
to keep singapore's cyberspace safe and

380
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:28,720
secure

381
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:31,440
he also has on his personal side he's

382
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:34,000
graduated from stanford and harvard and

383
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,600
has a passion and has founded

384
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,800
numerous non-profit digital startups

385
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,959
and is also the national lead for tech

386
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:42,800
for good the volunteer run

387
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:46,000
organization and i first met gurav

388
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,160
several years ago at the paris peace

389
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,120
forum

390
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,720
and we hit it off and i was really

391
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,720
impressed with his depth of experience

392
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,079
and his perspective

393
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:56,399
and i knew he was going to be someone

394
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:58,240
who could really

395
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:01,120
vocalize and help explain provide

396
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,160
guidance

397
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:04,399
for this next generation going forward

398
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:07,519
you know where singapore sees it's going

399
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:10,000
so anyway it's my honor and privilege to

400
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,440
introduce

401
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:17,839
daewon kino general gurov thank you

402
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,360
thank you so much for having me here

403
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,360
it's an honor and it's a pleasure

404
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:26,399
i'm excited and surprised

405
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:29,199
and a little bit disappointed to be here

406
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:30,480
i'm excited because

407
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,480
this is black hat and holy cow i'm

408
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:33,600
speaking at it

409
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,519
this is incredibly exciting at least to

410
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:37,440
me i've watched black hat online for

411
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,199
many years i've learned so much

412
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:40,800
and to be given this opportunity is a

413
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,639
real honor

414
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:44,959
i'm also surprised and once you google

415
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:47,760
me you'll also be surprised

416
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:50,240
what on earth is an ex-air force pilot

417
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,920
doing at black hat

418
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:53,519
is he at the wrong event it should be at

419
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:55,120
a different conference black flight

420
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:56,959
helmet to something else

421
00:14:56,959 --> 00:14:59,120
how did i end up being responsible for

422
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,079
driving

423
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:02,160
cyber security capability development in

424
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:04,000
singapore

425
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,399
finally i'm also a bit disappointed

426
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:07,279
because frankly

427
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:08,880
when i got the invitation to speak at

428
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:11,199
black hat i was really excited to meet

429
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:14,160
the people chat with you guys have a

430
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:14,959
beer

431
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:17,839
and feel this amazing community spirit

432
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:18,240
well

433
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,800
hopefully next year so at this point

434
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,000
you're probably wondering

435
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,600
what am i doing here who am i and

436
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,440
i am a relative newcomer to the cyber

437
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,120
security industry but i'm looking

438
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:30,240
forward to being part of it

439
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:32,399
over the years i studied computer

440
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:34,560
science many years back before cyber

441
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,800
security was even a subject

442
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,160
i don't think was even a real word in

443
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:40,079
the 90s

444
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:43,519
but despite my promising start

445
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:45,839
i signed up to become an air force pilot

446
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:49,440
and 20 years of being in the military

447
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,040
was an interesting experience quite

448
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:53,120
different from cyber security

449
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,800
i must say that last year at the keynote

450
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,399
speech when mikko hippenin

451
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:58,079
spoke about how many fighters our air

452
00:15:58,079 --> 00:15:59,600
force had i definitely sat up a little

453
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,040
bit straighter

454
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:03,759
my pilot call sign is yoda long story

455
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:05,600
but because of my tech background and my

456
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,680
interest in technology

457
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:10,000
all the tools i built i was appointed as

458
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,759
the chief innovation officer of the air

459
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:12,480
force

460
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:13,839
and the commander for the air defense

461
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:17,040
and operations command in my final tour

462
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:19,519
that command is responsible for all of

463
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:20,959
the operations that we run

464
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:23,759
obviously and if you think it sucks to

465
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:25,600
get your social media account hacked

466
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,279
well i was responsible for the cyber

467
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:29,440
defense of all of our networked missiles

468
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:32,399
radars control systems and aircraft so

469
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:32,880
that

470
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,959
really would suck and so i took cyber

471
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:36,880
security extremely seriously in that

472
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,160
tour

473
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:40,240
one thing led to another and here i am

474
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,680
at the cyber security agency of

475
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:44,160
singapore

476
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:47,600
i'm now responsible for redesigning how

477
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:50,000
we defend singapore from blue teaming to

478
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:50,959
red teaming

479
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:52,959
to all of the capabilities in between

480
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:54,480
and i wanted to use this keynote to

481
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:55,440
share with you a few

482
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:58,160
thoughts more like questions actually

483
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:59,600
that i've been reflecting on as i take

484
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,040
on this journey

485
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,240
and because i come from a

486
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:04,400
non-traditional background i thought it

487
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,240
might be useful to draw inspiration from

488
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:09,359
unlikely sources so here we go now the

489
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:10,640
first thing i realized

490
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:13,679
is that defending a country is not the

491
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:14,959
same as defending

492
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:18,079
a network

493
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,359
i know that this audience is full of

494
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:21,359
people who know how to defend and attack

495
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:23,839
corporate networks but unfortunately i

496
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:25,439
cannot just extrapolate the techniques

497
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:27,039
for defending a network to defend

498
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:29,520
singapore

499
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:33,600
a country has bounded geography

500
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:36,000
but there are many related and unrelated

501
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,360
network topologies that kind of

502
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:40,000
crisscross inside the borders

503
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,280
they have dependencies on network

504
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:43,120
topologies outside our borders

505
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:44,799
they interact in intricate ways to

506
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:47,520
provide an essential service to people

507
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:50,799
and defending this open interconnected

508
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:53,360
network this digital space within a

509
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:55,280
geographical area

510
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:57,280
is infinitely more complex than

511
00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:00,240
defending a corporate network one of the

512
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:01,679
first lessons i learned in cyber

513
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:02,880
security was

514
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:05,360
know your assets well try doing that on

515
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:06,400
the scale of a

516
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,640
country i think i could retire before i

517
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,640
figured out what our assets were

518
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:12,960
now complicating this even further is

519
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:15,440
that singapore isn't content to just be

520
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:18,480
on the internet no we want to be a

521
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:21,120
smart nation a leading light that

522
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:23,120
showcases how we can use digital

523
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:25,200
technologies to make our citizens lives

524
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,720
better

525
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:29,360
digitizing everything from lampposts to

526
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:30,480
traffic lights

527
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,160
and when you digitize everything at that

528
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:34,320
scale cybersecurity professionals step

529
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:35,520
back and think

530
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:38,080
attack vectors i see attack vectors

531
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:39,280
everywhere

532
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:41,840
and it's true so the cyber security

533
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:43,039
agency of singapore

534
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:46,160
has a pretty expansive mission

535
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:48,720
we keep our cyberspace safe and secure

536
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,799
to underpin our national security

537
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:53,360
power a digital economy and protect our

538
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:56,720
digital way of life

539
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,480
i'll cover four broad questions in this

540
00:18:58,480 --> 00:18:59,840
speech

541
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,760
should cyber security be a public good

542
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:03,440
or a private good

543
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,440
should users or vendors be responsible

544
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:07,280
for cyber security

545
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:08,960
should cyber security be a policy

546
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:11,520
problem or an engineering problem

547
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:13,760
and should cyber security be a cost or a

548
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:15,360
benefit to manufacturers

549
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:16,960
and i'll wrap all this up and kind of

550
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:18,400
answer that big question how do we

551
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:21,120
defend singapore

552
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:23,280
so let's start with the first question

553
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:24,880
should cyber security be

554
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:28,400
a public good or a private good and

555
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,480
it starts with econs 101 you know what

556
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:31,840
is a public good

557
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:33,600
a public good in economics is one that

558
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:36,880
is non-excludable and non-rivalrous

559
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:39,440
lamp posts for example are public good

560
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:41,200
they're non-excludable

561
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,679
i cannot exclude you from enjoying the

562
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:45,039
light of this lamppost

563
00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:47,280
just by standing underneath it it's

564
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:48,559
non-rivalrous

565
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:51,280
i cannot my benefit from enjoying this

566
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:51,679
light

567
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:53,360
doesn't prevent you from benefiting and

568
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:54,799
enjoying this light

569
00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:56,240
public goods are therefore a bit of a

570
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:58,160
complicated problem provision and

571
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,919
governments generally step in to provide

572
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:00,880
public goods

573
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,480
because it's difficult for the private

574
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,000
market to price these things

575
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,840
so things like clean water national

576
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:08,240
defense these are public goods

577
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,320
the opposite of a public good is a

578
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:11,679
private bad

579
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:13,760
i'm just kidding it's a private good and

580
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:14,960
a private good is

581
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:16,559
built by companies many of you work for

582
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:18,840
them and sold to consumers i am one of

583
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:21,360
them so asking whether cyber security

584
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:22,880
should be a public good or a private

585
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,240
good is actually a really important

586
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,039
question

587
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:26,640
because if we decide that it is a

588
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,799
private good purely a private good

589
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:30,400
then i can end the speech very quickly

590
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,400
because it's not my problem

591
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,240
it's your problem please defend

592
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:36,960
singapore thank you very much

593
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:39,039
but if we decide that it is a public

594
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:40,640
good then

595
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,080
you can all zone out because it's not

596
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:44,080
your problem it's my problem i will

597
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:45,919
defend the internet for you

598
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:47,840
clearly this is a false dichotomy and

599
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:49,520
the answer is somewhere in between

600
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:50,880
but i want to push this conversation

601
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,400
further because it's an important

602
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:53,760
question

603
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,360
now the lessons that we can learn about

604
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:56,960
public goods and how we deal with it in

605
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:57,600
singapore

606
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:58,880
from singapore's experience with

607
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:01,280
policing when you walk through the

608
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:02,480
streets in singapore

609
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:06,240
even at night 93 of people feel safe

610
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:08,000
the economist intelligence unit ranked

611
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,440
us as the second safest city in the

612
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:10,240
world

613
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:12,000
and how do we do this and what lessons

614
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
can cyber security learn from it

615
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,240
well we have police who patrol the

616
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:17,200
streets they're part of the

617
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,240
neighborhoods

618
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:20,080
and the singapore police force provides

619
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:22,400
a public good called security

620
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:24,640
to reduce the risk that gangs of armed

621
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:26,880
robbers are roaming my neighborhood

622
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:29,840
they do public good called security but

623
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:30,640
that said

624
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:33,440
i still invest in private security i

625
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:35,039
invest in locks on my door i have

626
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:36,320
cameras at home and i have an alarm

627
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:37,360
system

628
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:39,440
but i know what type of threats i'm

629
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:41,360
responsible for defending myself against

630
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:43,120
and what type of threats i can rely on

631
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:45,679
the police to protect me from

632
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:47,360
i've come to a good balance in that

633
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:48,880
sense of how much security the

634
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,320
government provides and how much users

635
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:51,520
provide

636
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:54,080
but in the digital world do we have the

637
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:55,360
right balance

638
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:57,760
should we continue to expect users to

639
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:58,960
protect themselves against

640
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:01,679
all threats big and small let me give

641
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:03,120
another example to make this even

642
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:04,000
clearer

643
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
this time from public sanitation

644
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,120
basically

645
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:11,120
water and sewage literally up until the

646
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:12,240
1800s

647
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:14,720
nations treated drinking water the way

648
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:15,840
we currently treat

649
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:18,480
cyber security governments would warn

650
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:19,440
their people

651
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:22,799
don't drink dirty water do not mix your

652
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:23,600
poop water

653
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:26,320
with your drinking water it is your

654
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:28,400
responsibility to boil the water and

655
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:29,840
make sure you are not drinking dirty

656
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:31,840
water

657
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:33,679
governments truly believed that the

658
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:35,360
users were the weakest link

659
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:37,440
and they kept drinking dirty water and

660
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:38,840
dying of all sorts of disgusting

661
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:40,880
diseases

662
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,480
now it became a public health problem

663
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:44,880
because these diseases were contagious

664
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,640
rather than just affecting a private

665
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:47,919
user

666
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:50,000
one person's lack of water hygiene

667
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,360
spread to became

668
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:54,240
many people's health problems so

669
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:55,520
governments decide to change their

670
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:56,400
mental model

671
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,640
and they built these vast networks of

672
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:00,080
plumbing and sewage

673
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:02,159
to provide people with clean water

674
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:03,919
straight from the tap

675
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:06,000
they realize that clean drinking water

676
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,120
is a public good

677
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:09,039
to some extent because the problem

678
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:11,840
affected the whole national health state

679
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:14,480
today with modern filtration you can

680
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:15,360
turn on the tap

681
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:17,440
and drink the water we've curbed the

682
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:19,120
problems of people contracting strange

683
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:19,840
diseases

684
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:22,320
through contaminated water by making it

685
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:23,360
easier to drink

686
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:25,600
clean water now not everybody drinks

687
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:26,880
water from the tap

688
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,960
industries obviously need highly pure

689
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:31,120
water and they buy that

690
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:32,799
people drink bottled water and some

691
00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:34,559
hipsters put fruit and little copper

692
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:36,320
tubes to ionize their water

693
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:37,840
people have their own balance of what

694
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:39,440
type of water they want to drink

695
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:41,120
from the private market and the public

696
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:43,120
market there's a balance

697
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:45,520
so where are we for cyber security i

698
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:47,360
think you can recognize from my not so

699
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:49,120
subtle analogy that we're still

700
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:51,760
around the 1800s some parts have moved

701
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:52,320
forward

702
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,640
but generally our view is we're warning

703
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:56,559
people don't drink dirty water

704
00:23:56,559 --> 00:23:58,320
and if you're drinking it and dying it's

705
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:00,320
probably your fault

706
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:02,480
that may still be necessary but i don't

707
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:04,320
think it's sufficient

708
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:06,400
cyber hygiene is becoming a public

709
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,679
health crisis

710
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:10,720
just like water sanitation it's no

711
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:12,159
longer a private problem

712
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:13,919
now as more users connect to the

713
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:15,840
internet whether it's through their

714
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:18,320
laptops their phones their smart watches

715
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:21,279
their baby cameras their wi-fi routers

716
00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:22,799
we need to be worried about our

717
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:24,960
essential services being ddosed

718
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,960
by botnets just like the mirai attacks

719
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:29,120
in 2016.

720
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:31,440
one user's lack of cyber hygiene

721
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:33,440
actually now translates to a contagion

722
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:34,240
which can affect

723
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:36,400
other users just like how all of the

724
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,400
wi-fi routers and printers were hijacked

725
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:41,279
to disrupt my online streaming access

726
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:42,799
so we need to start thinking of how we

727
00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:44,960
can provide clean drinking water from

728
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:45,760
the tap

729
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:47,840
and make sure that any poo in the water

730
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:49,120
is taken out upstream

731
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:51,600
at the filtration plants now the analogy

732
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:52,720
isn't perfect

733
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:55,039
it's not a pure public good but it gives

734
00:24:55,039 --> 00:24:56,000
you a sense of where a

735
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,919
drawn and what kind of answers we could

736
00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:00,400
have for the cybersecurity digital world

737
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:01,600
how much should governments be

738
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:04,000
responsible for i don't quite know the

739
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:04,720
answer

740
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:06,159
but i do know we should be responsible

741
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:08,159
for much more and in singapore we're

742
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:09,840
rolling out the safer cyberspace master

743
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:10,400
plan

744
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,320
which is our master plan to build a

745
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:14,559
safer cyberspace

746
00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:16,880
is to protect all users small and big

747
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:17,840
and it's ambitious

748
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:20,640
it seeks to rebalance this equation and

749
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,679
to provide that that

750
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:24,720
clean drinking water from the tap

751
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:25,919
we want to make singapore one of the

752
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:28,640
most cyber secure nations in the world

753
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:30,080
i don't want to reveal too much about it

754
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:31,679
because next week at the singapore

755
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:32,799
international cyber week

756
00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:34,400
we'll be announcing all of the details

757
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,159
so stay tuned for that and i urge you to

758
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:38,480
attend if possible

759
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:41,520
so the second question

760
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:42,880
now that we've explored the role of what

761
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:44,240
government should be in the provision of

762
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:45,360
public goods

763
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:47,039
let's dive a little bit deeper into the

764
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:48,880
private goods market

765
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,159
there are two parties involved in the

766
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:52,400
transaction the consumers

767
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,880
the customers the users and the

768
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:57,279
producers the vendors the oems

769
00:25:57,279 --> 00:26:00,799
the developers today we largely hold

770
00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:01,360
users

771
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:04,240
responsible for cyber security i built

772
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:05,039
the cloud

773
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:06,559
but you as the customer are responsible

774
00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:08,159
for configuring it and if you configured

775
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:09,279
it wrongly it's

776
00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:11,919
your fault you need to have a stronger

777
00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:13,600
password because you registered on my

778
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:15,039
website

779
00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:16,720
now i've interfaced with many industries

780
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:18,799
over my career but the cyber security

781
00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:19,919
industry is always a little bit of a

782
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:21,440
strange one to me

783
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:23,679
in most sectors the customer is always

784
00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:24,640
right

785
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:27,200
it's but in cyber security it's actually

786
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,240
acceptable

787
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:30,960
to tell the user to their face that the

788
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:33,279
user is the weakest link the customer is

789
00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:34,960
wrong

790
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:38,080
it's unusual and i argue it's unhealthy

791
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:40,320
it creates a self-fulfilling prophecy

792
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:42,559
where our wider industry doesn't take

793
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:44,559
full accountability and responsibility

794
00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:46,720
and ownership for this problem

795
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:48,240
and i know that we pride ourselves on

796
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:50,080
being separate from the developer the

797
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:51,679
software developer sectors

798
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:53,760
but we need to be careful in how we

799
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:55,600
apply this distinction in front of the

800
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:57,039
public

801
00:26:57,039 --> 00:26:58,480
allow me to now draw some unusual

802
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:00,240
lessons from the automotive industry to

803
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:02,000
explain this

804
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,440
you've probably heard this analogy a few

805
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:04,880
times but cyber security is like the

806
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:06,000
brakes on a car

807
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,600
while technically brakes are the things

808
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:09,200
that slow you down

809
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:12,320
actually brakes are the thing that

810
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:15,440
without which you dare not go fast good

811
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:16,880
brakes actually help you have the

812
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:19,360
confidence to go faster

813
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:20,880
it's a useful analogy and even though

814
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:22,960
you've heard it many times i argue we

815
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:23,360
don't

816
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:26,799
push it far enough when you buy a car

817
00:27:26,799 --> 00:27:29,360
a car salesman comes up to you and says

818
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:30,799
this is a good car

819
00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:32,559
it's got a good engine it's got good

820
00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:34,399
wheels it's got good brakes and it costs

821
00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:35,600
this much

822
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:38,320
you do not go to a car showroom to hear

823
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:39,840
the car designer

824
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:41,440
the engine designer and the brakes

825
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:43,039
designer have an argument about whose

826
00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:44,559
responsibility is to prevent you from

827
00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:45,520
crashing

828
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:47,440
they sort that argument out behind the

829
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:49,679
scenes they have their robust debates

830
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:51,440
and they come to a conclusion before

831
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:53,039
they launch the car

832
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:55,279
customers expect good brakes to be part

833
00:27:55,279 --> 00:27:56,640
of a good car

834
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:58,080
they don't want to hear your arguments

835
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:59,919
in front of them and it confuses

836
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:03,200
customers and it reduces car sales

837
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,520
another lesson from the car industry

838
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:07,520
actually cars became a lot more popular

839
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:09,600
when they became safer and easier to

840
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,200
drive safely

841
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,799
today you don't need to know what a

842
00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:14,480
carburetor is and all the other parts of

843
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:16,320
a car in order to drive it

844
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:18,080
the automotive industry got to where it

845
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:19,520
is today

846
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:21,679
because they realized that drivers are

847
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:23,120
an essential part

848
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:25,919
of the industry's ecosystem they didn't

849
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:26,480
blame

850
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:29,520
bad drivers as external actors they

851
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:31,600
didn't blame them for the accidents

852
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:34,240
no they learned from the accidents that

853
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:36,320
bad drivers had and they recognized bad

854
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:38,000
drivers will continue to exist

855
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,240
but they learned the lessons and they

856
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:41,840
built crumple zones

857
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:44,640
they built airbags they built better

858
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:45,360
seat belts

859
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:47,679
they built forward sensors reverse

860
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:48,960
sensors cameras

861
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:51,360
blind spot alerts they learned lessons

862
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:52,559
from accidents and made

863
00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:54,720
safer cars so you don't need to be a car

864
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:55,840
engineer

865
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:58,240
i'm an air force pilot so this trend is

866
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:00,559
even starker in aviation

867
00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:02,720
modern civil airliners can fly

868
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:04,640
themselves pretty much all the way

869
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:07,200
safely and some aircraft are so advanced

870
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:07,760
that

871
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:11,039
pilots barely need to touch the controls

872
00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:12,399
we need to take these lessons and

873
00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:14,320
engineer more secure products

874
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:17,279
that basically protect the users instead

875
00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:18,880
of designing more and more complex

876
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:20,159
auditing procedures

877
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:23,200
or post-hoc measures to slap on security

878
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:24,240
at the end of it

879
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:27,039
because that's not an effective approach

880
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:28,720
cybersecurity has evolved to become a

881
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:29,600
complex

882
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:31,760
monster that even the initiated

883
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:32,720
professionals

884
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:35,440
find it challenging to understand but

885
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:36,640
that's not useful

886
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:38,960
cybersecurity needs to be usable in

887
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:40,399
order to be effective

888
00:29:40,399 --> 00:29:43,440
it needs to be inclusive every person is

889
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:46,320
part of our ecosystem small and big not

890
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:48,399
just the technically savvy ones

891
00:29:48,399 --> 00:29:50,080
even at the government level we're

892
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:51,760
taking this message on board by taking

893
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:52,880
devsecops

894
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:54,399
and making it our way of launching

895
00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:57,200
products we're trying to simplify

896
00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:00,320
security as part at the national level

897
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:01,919
to make it easier for developers to

898
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:04,240
adopt best practices

899
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:06,799
some examples we've pushed out sync pass

900
00:30:06,799 --> 00:30:08,399
as the national digital biometric

901
00:30:08,399 --> 00:30:09,679
authentication system

902
00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:11,600
and we're enabling important apps like

903
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:13,120
those from the banking sector

904
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:16,320
to access it for authentication we

905
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:17,840
simplify the back end

906
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:20,240
so that the users the developers don't

907
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:21,679
have to think about it so much

908
00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:23,679
and it makes it invisible or nearly

909
00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:24,960
invisible to the user

910
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:26,640
part of a seamless and convenient

911
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:28,000
experience

912
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,480
we want to make the secure process the

913
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:31,600
easier process

914
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,440
just like it's really hard to dig up a

915
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:34,799
well in your backyard

916
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:37,440
boil the water and drink it it's easier

917
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:39,600
to drink water straight from the tap

918
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:41,520
and now the cleaner experience the safer

919
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:44,240
experience is the better experience

920
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:46,240
people adopt better habits when it is

921
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:47,520
convenient to do so

922
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:49,600
and revert back to bad habits when it is

923
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:50,880
inconvenient

924
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,399
so we want the secure way to be the

925
00:30:52,399 --> 00:30:54,880
easier way we see the industry doing

926
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:55,200
this

927
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:58,480
and we encourage it we move on now to

928
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:00,080
the third question

929
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:01,840
but the summary of my first two

930
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:03,279
questions is basically

931
00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:05,519
users vendors and governments have a

932
00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:06,799
part to play

933
00:31:06,799 --> 00:31:08,880
no surprises there but it's interesting

934
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:10,799
to note that for this question

935
00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:12,480
should cyber security be a policy

936
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:14,240
problem or an engineering problem

937
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:15,600
we find that different parts have

938
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:17,919
different answers governments have

939
00:31:17,919 --> 00:31:19,679
generally taken a very policy-centric

940
00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:21,919
approach to the problem thus far

941
00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:24,159
there's a problem with internet security

942
00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:25,919
we'll put in laws regulations and

943
00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:27,360
policies to make sure that our message

944
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:28,559
is loud and clear

945
00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:30,960
singapore has a cyber security act

946
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:32,159
industry on the other hand

947
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:33,760
has taken a very engineering-centric

948
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:35,440
approach to the problem

949
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:37,440
partly because they can't set policies

950
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:38,799
so there's a specific problem with

951
00:31:38,799 --> 00:31:40,399
internet security

952
00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:42,000
by my new product it has artificial

953
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,519
intelligence machine learning

954
00:31:43,519 --> 00:31:47,039
blockchain and robots but i think

955
00:31:47,039 --> 00:31:48,720
as usual the answer is somewhere in

956
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:51,200
between governments need to take a more

957
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,559
engineering approach to the problem to

958
00:31:52,559 --> 00:31:54,159
complement policies

959
00:31:54,159 --> 00:31:56,880
again using cars as an example it's easy

960
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:59,120
to put speed limits all over the road

961
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:01,120
but that's a policy solution not fully

962
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:02,799
an engineering solution

963
00:32:02,799 --> 00:32:04,720
an engineering solution is thinking

964
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:06,080
about speed humps

965
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:08,000
thinking about speed cameras and now

966
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,840
they have such sophisticated speed

967
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:10,399
cameras

968
00:32:10,399 --> 00:32:12,480
that it detects your average speed over

969
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:14,640
a long road rather than just your speed

970
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:15,760
at a point in time

971
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:17,440
now that's a clever engineering approach

972
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:19,279
to slowing down cars

973
00:32:19,279 --> 00:32:20,640
i think you can see the pattern to my

974
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:22,399
answers it's not

975
00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:24,880
extremes but somewhere in the middle

976
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:25,440
blending

977
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:28,559
engineering policy economics legislation

978
00:32:28,559 --> 00:32:30,559
social and organizational behavior and

979
00:32:30,559 --> 00:32:32,880
that singapore's approach

980
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:34,720
we sometimes place engineers to write

981
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:36,640
policies and

982
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:39,360
non-technical people to write capability

983
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:40,240
development

984
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:41,679
but our end goal is to make sure that we

985
00:32:41,679 --> 00:32:43,679
have taken this problem and approached

986
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:46,720
it from all directions

987
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:50,399
we move now to the fourth question now

988
00:32:50,399 --> 00:32:52,399
i'm talking so much about cars

989
00:32:52,399 --> 00:32:55,120
because quite recently i exchanged my

990
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:57,279
gas guzzling car for a smaller hybrid

991
00:32:57,279 --> 00:32:58,720
car

992
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:00,559
i did a lot of research otherwise known

993
00:33:00,559 --> 00:33:01,760
as car shopping

994
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:03,600
and one thing i realized that because

995
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:06,320
i'm now the father of a little boy

996
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:08,240
i'm no longer looking for the coolest

997
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:10,000
car that is befitting of the

998
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:13,039
image of an air force pilot no i spent a

999
00:33:13,039 --> 00:33:15,679
tremendous and inordinate amount of time

1000
00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:17,919
looking for the safest car comparing

1001
00:33:17,919 --> 00:33:19,679
safety features

1002
00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:21,600
and in the end i actually ended up

1003
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:23,679
paying more for a car

1004
00:33:23,679 --> 00:33:26,559
with better safety features what i

1005
00:33:26,559 --> 00:33:28,399
noticed was that cars were competing and

1006
00:33:28,399 --> 00:33:29,679
branding themselves

1007
00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:32,799
on safety this brings me to that last

1008
00:33:32,799 --> 00:33:33,840
question

1009
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:37,200
can cyber security be seen as a benefit

1010
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:40,080
rather than a cost to manufacturers now

1011
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:41,679
in the past few years we've done well to

1012
00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:43,360
elevate and escalate cyber security to

1013
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:45,200
become a management concern at the board

1014
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:46,080
level

1015
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:48,480
but they're still taking the discussions

1016
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:49,919
as a delicate trade-off between

1017
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:53,519
cost and balance but cost and benefits

1018
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:54,159
sorry

1019
00:33:54,159 --> 00:33:57,440
between security and usability and

1020
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:59,840
sometimes there's a race to the bottom

1021
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:01,760
where they try and spend the minimum

1022
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:03,840
amount on cyber security just to meet

1023
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:06,399
compliance requirements

1024
00:34:06,399 --> 00:34:08,000
the discussions are driven by the mental

1025
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,399
model that cyber security is a cost

1026
00:34:10,399 --> 00:34:12,480
and it's a cost they have to bear to do

1027
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:13,440
business

1028
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:15,679
customers do not reward good cyber

1029
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:16,800
security habits

1030
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:18,800
but they heavily punish bad cyber

1031
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:20,399
security habits

1032
00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:22,079
can we flip this around and make

1033
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:23,599
cybersecurity a selling point to

1034
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:24,239
customers

1035
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:25,918
as they become more conscious of their

1036
00:34:25,918 --> 00:34:27,918
safety and security

1037
00:34:27,918 --> 00:34:29,760
again we learnt lessons from unusual

1038
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:31,918
sources food labels

1039
00:34:31,918 --> 00:34:36,000
and air conditioners first food labels

1040
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,079
we realized that cyber security benefits

1041
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:41,359
are actually quite invisible to the user

1042
00:34:41,359 --> 00:34:43,119
but similar to how we highlight the

1043
00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:44,480
nutritional value

1044
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:46,320
and ingredients of food products on the

1045
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:48,079
side of most of them

1046
00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:49,599
if you care about your diet you can take

1047
00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:51,359
a look at the label and avoid the sugary

1048
00:34:51,359 --> 00:34:52,480
drinks

1049
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:54,399
if you are on a specific keto diet you

1050
00:34:54,399 --> 00:34:55,918
can again check the label

1051
00:34:55,918 --> 00:34:57,119
and buy the food that suits your

1052
00:34:57,119 --> 00:34:59,040
requirements but today

1053
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:00,960
i have no way to look at a router and

1054
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:02,079
decide

1055
00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:04,320
this router is more secure than that

1056
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:05,440
router

1057
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:07,599
it's invisible to me and customers

1058
00:35:07,599 --> 00:35:08,480
cannot pay

1059
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:11,200
for what they cannot see so we started

1060
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:11,920
thinking

1061
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:14,240
what if we could put a nutrition label

1062
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:15,119
on iot

1063
00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:18,720
devices on digital products

1064
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:20,720
that's exactly what we're doing we will

1065
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:22,480
be introducing the cyber security

1066
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:23,920
labeling scheme

1067
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:25,839
on network connected devices and we've

1068
00:35:25,839 --> 00:35:27,920
got a range from one start to four star

1069
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:29,119
for being the best

1070
00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:30,640
again i don't want to give away too much

1071
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:32,160
we'll be announcing all of the details

1072
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:32,800
next week

1073
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,480
but think of it like nutrition labels

1074
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:38,000
for food except now on products

1075
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,880
we also learn from air conditioners many

1076
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:41,520
years ago

1077
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:43,359
air conditioners were terribly energy

1078
00:35:43,359 --> 00:35:44,560
inefficient

1079
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:46,320
and so singapore introduced what we call

1080
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:49,200
the five tick system

1081
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:52,160
over time it became very popular and

1082
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:52,720
today

1083
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:54,640
you can't buy an air conditioner that

1084
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:56,880
doesn't have ticks or has one tick

1085
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:58,880
every air conditioner advertises itself

1086
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:00,400
on four ticks or five ticks

1087
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:03,440
some are even making up a sixth tick

1088
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:05,839
this is a fantastic race to the top and

1089
00:36:05,839 --> 00:36:07,040
we want this to happen

1090
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:09,839
in cyber security we want to educate

1091
00:36:09,839 --> 00:36:10,640
consumers

1092
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:12,560
and we want to encourage and incentivize

1093
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:14,000
manufacturers to build

1094
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,560
better safer more secure products so

1095
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:18,880
that the whole ecosystem moves up

1096
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:20,640
it's a race to the top rather than a

1097
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:23,760
race to the bottom for the lowest cost

1098
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:25,839
we've taken quite a long journey now

1099
00:36:25,839 --> 00:36:27,920
across four big questions and from

1100
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:29,920
highly unusual sources

1101
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:33,280
these four questions bring me to the

1102
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:35,359
biggest question on my mind

1103
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:38,000
how do i defend a nation how do i defend

1104
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,440
singapore

1105
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:41,440
and the answer in my mind requires us to

1106
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:42,960
change our mental models

1107
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:45,359
on what cyber security is and how we do

1108
00:36:45,359 --> 00:36:46,160
it

1109
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:49,440
first cyber security is both a public

1110
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:50,000
good

1111
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,920
and a private good so the government

1112
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:54,160
will be taking a more proactive approach

1113
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:57,040
in securing the cyberspace for our users

1114
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:59,440
together with our industry partners

1115
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:02,160
second we want to design digital tools

1116
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:02,960
that are more

1117
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:05,520
secure by design so that the more

1118
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:06,160
convenient

1119
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:08,480
option for users is the safer and more

1120
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:10,400
secure option

1121
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:12,400
third we want to complement our strong

1122
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:14,320
policies with clever engineering

1123
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:15,599
solutions

1124
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:17,920
and fourth we want cybersecurity to be

1125
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:19,200
seen as a benefit

1126
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:20,960
not just a cost and we want the whole

1127
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:22,240
ecosystem to move

1128
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:24,480
upwards to build better safer products

1129
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:25,920
for users

1130
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:27,599
i don't know what the right answers are

1131
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:28,800
i don't know what the perfect solution

1132
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:29,839
is going to look like

1133
00:37:29,839 --> 00:37:31,119
but i hope that we're asking at least

1134
00:37:31,119 --> 00:37:33,359
some of the right questions i still have

1135
00:37:33,359 --> 00:37:34,560
much to learn

1136
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:36,320
so i hope to be back here regularly and

1137
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:37,680
get to know more of you

1138
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:39,119
get to learn from more of you and be

1139
00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:41,520
part of the audience in future

1140
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:43,200
thank you so much for your attention and

1141
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:44,880
i look forward to hearing your views

1142
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:46,560
on this speech i'm sure there are enough

1143
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:48,000
hackers in this audience so you can all

1144
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,280
find my email

1145
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:51,839
thank you very much
