00:00:03,679 --> 00:00:04,960
hello blackhead

2
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:08,000
nice to meet you let me introduce myself

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,200
my name is sergey puzankov i work at

4
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:12,719
positive technologies

5
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:16,160
as a telecom security expert today

6
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:18,960
i will tell you about the results of our

7
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:20,800
recent security research on mixed

8
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:23,279
generation mobile networks

9
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:26,160
first of all let me introduce the team

10
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:27,039
without which

11
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:31,519
this research would not be possible

12
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:35,280
these are sergey mashukov alexander

13
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:38,480
onegov pavel novikov

14
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:41,520
and myself all these guys have

15
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,920
great skills and enormous experience in

16
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:46,079
mobile security realm

17
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:48,000
i'll talk about vulnerabilities in

18
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,280
signaling protocols

19
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:51,760
so a few words about what signal

20
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:52,320
networks

21
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:55,360
are nowadays mobile networks use

22
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:58,079
three general signaling systems for

23
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:00,800
interoperation between operators

24
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:04,559
ss7 diameter and gtp

25
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:07,760
s7 is a set of protocols not just one

26
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:09,760
it is primarily intended to set up and

27
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:12,400
tear down telephone calls

28
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:15,680
later when mobile telephony appeared ss7

29
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:19,840
began to be used for subscriber mobility

30
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:22,799
roaming short messages and other

31
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:24,400
services

32
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,799
diameter is originally an altercation

33
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:27,759
authorization

34
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:30,240
and accounting protocol however this

35
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,640
protocol is extensible

36
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:36,000
rft 5516 is an example

37
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,439
of an extension this rfc defines

38
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:42,320
a set of common codes used in

39
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:45,040
applications for the evolved packed core

40
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,960
a world packet core is a switching

41
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:48,640
system of

42
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:52,960
lte networks gtp is a group of protocols

43
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,000
that were developed

44
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,560
to control packet data services on jsm

45
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:57,520
networks

46
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:01,040
however later gtp was adapted to work on

47
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:04,799
umts lte and even 5g networks with

48
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:06,960
non-standalone architecture signal

49
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,479
protocols are used between network

50
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:10,959
elements on operators infrastructure

51
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:13,680
not on the user side the basic unit in

52
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,360
signaling is a message

53
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,160
or a signal message this is like a

54
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:20,239
packet on ip networks

55
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:22,640
i will use the term message throughout

56
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,080
the presentation

57
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,800
please bear in mind that when i say

58
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:27,440
message

59
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:30,080
i mean not an sms message but a

60
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,959
signaling message

61
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,840
when an intruder gets access to the

62
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:38,319
signal network at any time compilator

63
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:41,040
that intruder can track locations

64
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:41,840
intercept

65
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:44,959
sms and voice calls performs denial of

66
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:47,040
service attacks on subscribers and home

67
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,080
networks

68
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:51,120
steal money from subscribers get

69
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:54,319
access to a mail social media mobile

70
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:54,959
messenger

71
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:58,159
apps and other applications intruders

72
00:02:58,159 --> 00:02:59,040
are able to do

73
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:02,239
all these malicious actions against

74
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:05,200
any subscriber of any mobile operator

75
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,480
around the world

76
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:10,640
from any signaling connection

77
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,840
why are signal networks insecure when

78
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,440
the salem protocol stack

79
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,280
was developed nobody thought about

80
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,720
security

81
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:21,040
because ssl networks were originally

82
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:23,920
intended to support telephone calls only

83
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:26,400
they were assumed to be isolated from

84
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,400
other public networks

85
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,720
only a few large national telephone

86
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:33,760
providers would have access to ss7

87
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:36,640
but later mobile phones appeared the

88
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,239
number of players on the telephone

89
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:40,000
market rapidly increased

90
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,319
the number of users jumped and

91
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:43,280
consequently

92
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:46,319
the amount of signaling grew enormously

93
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:48,959
in the early 2000s a new specification

94
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:51,200
called sictron was introduced

95
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:54,319
sigtron allowed sending ss7 over ip

96
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:55,280
networks

97
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:58,400
so those two main assumptions underlying

98
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,439
signal security

99
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:02,560
were no longer true the number of

100
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,239
companies connected to

101
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:06,879
signal networks became huge and the

102
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:08,000
signal network

103
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,640
stopped being isolated new protocols

104
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:11,200
such as

105
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,920
diameter and gtp didn't solve security

106
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:14,720
either

107
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:18,079
in fact they brought new problems

108
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:20,639
fortunately mobile operators are aware

109
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:22,320
of the signaling security problem

110
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,880
and are trying to protect their networks

111
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,800
they implement signaling firewalls

112
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:30,800
sms home routine and signal ids systems

113
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,759
also mobile operators perform external

114
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:36,160
signal security assessments

115
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:39,199
however sometimes this is not enough

116
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:40,880
now i would like to describe the basic

117
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,960
identity and node types on mobile

118
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:43,680
networks

119
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,160
because i will also refer back to this

120
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:46,960
information

121
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:49,680
throughout the presentation the first

122
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,280
group of identities and nodes

123
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:54,800
is used on 2g and 3g networks such as

124
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,919
gsm and umts msa is then

125
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:00,800
this identifier with a long acronym is

126
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,160
just the phone number

127
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,880
we will use to call our friends mc

128
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:07,199
international mobile subscriber identity

129
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:10,560
this is the identity of a sim card gt

130
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,960
a global title this is the main address

131
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:13,680
of the core

132
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,639
node on telecom networks that looks like

133
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:16,960
the

134
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:20,000
msa's then or telephone number the

135
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,880
gt and mss then have the same structure

136
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:25,039
network elements root signal message but

137
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:26,160
they are

138
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:29,520
gt and mss dense i should also note that

139
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:30,720
the mssdn

140
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,800
and mc are used in all mobile

141
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:33,919
generations

142
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:37,039
stp signal transfer point this is a

143
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:38,880
switch for signal traffic

144
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,199
usually the stp is a border point on a

145
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:42,800
mobile network

146
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,199
hlr home location register is a

147
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:46,479
subscriber database

148
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:48,720
of a mobile operator it contains the

149
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:49,680
following data

150
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:52,560
mssdn and emc identifiers of subscriber

151
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,400
allowed on prohibited services

152
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:57,280
addresses of not serving the subscriber

153
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:57,680
and

154
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:01,759
certain other data msc vlr

155
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:03,680
this is a single node that performs two

156
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:06,479
functions the msc mobile vision center

157
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:09,120
is a switch for voice and sms traffic

158
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,759
the vlr vista location register is a

159
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:12,800
database

160
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,600
of active subscribers that contains copy

161
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,560
of subscriber profiles from the hlr

162
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,960
plus some information from the radio

163
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:21,919
access system

164
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:25,520
such as the identity of the servant cell

165
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:28,400
as json theorem gprs support node this

166
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,479
node performs the same function that the

167
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:32,000
msc vlr does

168
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,080
but for packet data services and smsc

169
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,960
sms center this note handles sending and

170
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:41,120
delivery of short messages

171
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:44,319
gsm and umts networks rely on ss7

172
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:45,199
signaling

173
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:48,080
as i previously said ss7 is a stack of

174
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,199
protocols

175
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:50,880
i will highlight the most important

176
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:53,120
protocols in it from the security point

177
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:53,919
of view

178
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:56,160
the lowest layer that works on the

179
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,199
international level

180
00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:00,080
is the sccp signal connection control

181
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:00,880
part

182
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,960
this protocol is responsible for global

183
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,720
routing of signaling messages

184
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:07,199
by telecom-specific identifiers which

185
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:08,800
are called global titles

186
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,840
the t-cup protocol is located above

187
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:15,039
the sccp this protocol combines single

188
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:17,039
requests and responses in two

189
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:19,759
dialogues and defines the context of the

190
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:21,520
upper layer application

191
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:24,240
the mobile application part or map is a

192
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,240
payload that contains a code of

193
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,639
a particular operation and relevant

194
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:29,759
parameters

195
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:32,880
mc location information profile data

196
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:35,680
and so on the second group of nodes is

197
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,360
used on 4g networks

198
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:41,520
such as lt d8 diameter edge agent

199
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,759
this is a switch for signal traffic

200
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:45,280
usually the da

201
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:48,160
is a border point on a mobile network it

202
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,120
works like an

203
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:52,479
stp but on diameter networks hss home

204
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:54,000
subscriber server

205
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,319
is a subscriber database of a mobile

206
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:57,599
operator

207
00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:01,199
the hss is an evolution of the hlr

208
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:02,000
applicable

209
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,599
on lte networks mme mobile management

210
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:06,160
entity

211
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,000
supports mobility management procedures

212
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,440
for mobile subscribers

213
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:13,280
and is responsible for choosing the sgw

214
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:16,720
sgw serving gateway is a switch of user

215
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:20,160
data packets ims ip multimedia system

216
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,160
this is not an lte node but an

217
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,360
independent system

218
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,599
responsible for standardization of voice

219
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:27,680
calls on ip networks

220
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:30,960
ims is often used on lte networks as an

221
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:33,679
extension for voice call transmission

222
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:36,000
diameter the signal protocol for lte

223
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:36,719
networks

224
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:39,440
this protocol is ip based the transport

225
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,640
layer protocol

226
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:43,599
is sctp this protocol was developed

227
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:44,959
specially for telecom

228
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:48,000
applications finally the top layer

229
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,480
is diameter itself with a common code

230
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:53,440
application id and other parameters

231
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,839
gtp is a group of protocols it is

232
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:56,800
divided into

233
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:59,920
three protocols gtpc the control part is

234
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,200
used for signaling

235
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:04,160
gtpu the user part is used for tunneling

236
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:04,640
of

237
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:08,080
user data and gtp prime is used to

238
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,000
charge user traffic

239
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,480
as i previously said gtp is used on both

240
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:15,760
jsm umts and lte 5g networks

241
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:19,519
i also described sjsn and sgw nodes

242
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:22,399
ggsn and pgw are gateways between the

243
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:23,519
mobile operator

244
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:26,560
and external internet gtpc is also

245
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:29,360
an ip based protocol it utilizes udp as

246
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:29,680
a

247
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:32,640
transport the gtpc payload is located

248
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,640
just above udp

249
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:37,440
mobile networks have evolved these days

250
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,680
they combine several generations

251
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:42,080
so that mobile subscribers have seamless

252
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:42,720
service

253
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:46,080
the home subscriber databases are joined

254
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:49,120
mobile networks of new generations such

255
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:49,519
as

256
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:52,560
4 and 5g must have connectivity to

257
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:55,200
previous generation networks for this

258
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:55,920
purpose

259
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:58,480
iwf interworking function equipment is

260
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,360
used

261
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:02,480
it allows relaying ss7 messages to

262
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,800
diameter ones and vice versa

263
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:07,279
a mobile device on the combined networks

264
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:09,120
is connected simultaneously to

265
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:12,160
all possible generations when a mobile

266
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:12,880
device is

267
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:15,920
somehow disconnected from one of the

268
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:16,800
networks

269
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:19,839
it still remains online via other

270
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:22,000
network generations having performed

271
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,720
signal security audits since

272
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:26,320
2015 we have gathered interesting

273
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,519
statistics

274
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:31,440
in 2015 we didn't encounter any ssn

275
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,079
firewalls

276
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:35,279
in our audits in 2016 about

277
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:37,760
nine percent of networks had ssn

278
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:38,560
firewalls

279
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:41,680
in recent years we have seen ssn

280
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:42,880
firewalls becoming

281
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:45,360
more common and what about diameter

282
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,399
security

283
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:49,839
in 2015 audits we didn't encounter any

284
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:51,519
networks protected by a diameter

285
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:52,320
firewall

286
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:55,440
the same was true in 2016 and

287
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:59,040
in 20172 the first diameter firewalls in

288
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,320
our audience appeared

289
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:03,920
only in 2018 our protection of diameter

290
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:04,720
networks

291
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:08,079
is much worse than for ss7 networks

292
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:10,720
this is why intruders have focused on

293
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,640
diameter networks

294
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:15,760
now i will talk about attack cases

295
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,680
that are feasible on mixed-generation

296
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,360
mobile networks

297
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:22,160
we have had the ability to recreate all

298
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:23,200
these attacks

299
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,519
in the wild during telecom security

300
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:26,320
assessments

301
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,320
the first case is voice call

302
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,360
interception or

303
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:33,200
meetum on a combined 2g 4g network

304
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:36,000
firstly i need to explain what a classic

305
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,800
medium attack on ss7 looks like

306
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:41,440
we assume that the intruder already

307
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,440
knows the emcee and address of the

308
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,720
serving msc

309
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:47,600
the attack consists of two steps in the

310
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:48,399
first step

311
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:50,880
the mail factor sends insult subscriber

312
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:51,440
data

313
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:54,480
to the msc vlr node in order to spoof a

314
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,680
billing platform

315
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:58,000
in the profile of the target subscriber

316
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,399
of course the main factor uses their

317
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:02,639
own address for the spoofed billing

318
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:03,760
platform

319
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:07,360
the msc vlr node just answers ok

320
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:09,279
and the mail factor finalizes the

321
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:10,639
transaction the

322
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:13,519
subscriber's profile is updated to

323
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:15,440
perform the second step of the attack

324
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,440
the mail factor should wait for the

325
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,959
subscriber to call

326
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:21,440
this call initiates a request to the

327
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,560
billing platform

328
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:25,120
that has been spoofed by the intruder at

329
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,800
the previous step

330
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:29,680
so the billing request in the initial dp

331
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:30,240
message

332
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,160
goes to the manufacturer's equipment

333
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,519
disclosing the numbers

334
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:36,480
of the subscribers involved in the call

335
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,880
the main factor sends a connect message

336
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,720
containing only one parameter

337
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:44,560
which is a number for call redirection

338
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,560
the intruder uses the number of their

339
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:48,639
own private branch exchange

340
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:51,680
the msc vlr obeys the command and

341
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:54,720
redirects the call to the intruder's pbx

342
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:57,360
then the intruder initiates the second

343
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:57,839
leg

344
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:00,399
of the call to the b subscriber spoofing

345
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:02,720
the number of the originating subscriber

346
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,399
they know information about the numbers

347
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:06,240
from the billing request

348
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,920
after that the call goes to the

349
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,839
appropriate subscriber and they are able

350
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:10,959
to talk

351
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:13,040
but what voice traffic goes through the

352
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:14,399
intruder's equipment

353
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:17,360
where they can record the call or listen

354
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:17,680
it

355
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:20,959
in real time and the same firewall can

356
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:22,639
protect the network against such

357
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:25,040
metim attacks when the hostile insert

358
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,399
subscriber data message

359
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:28,959
comes to the network the border stp

360
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:31,680
sends it to the ss7 firewall

361
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:34,560
the ss7 firewall sees the operation code

362
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,399
insert subscriber data

363
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:39,040
this is a category 2 operation meaning

364
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:39,519
that the

365
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:42,079
firewall has to check the source

366
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:43,040
operator

367
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:44,639
and the operator of the target

368
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:46,720
subscriber what we see

369
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:49,279
is a message sent from a swiss operator

370
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:51,600
but involving the subscriber from a

371
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,040
taiwanese operator

372
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,920
based on this result the ssn firewall

373
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,680
blocks the insert subscriber data

374
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:58,720
message

375
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:01,120
the network is protected when the

376
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,240
operator implements

377
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:06,079
voice over lte or volte the mme node

378
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:08,800
handles subscriber mobility and the ims

379
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,560
handles voice traffic

380
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,720
in this case even if the intruder

381
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,880
succeeds with the profile change in the

382
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:17,040
valuar database as the first step of the

383
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:17,920
midim attack

384
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:21,360
this does not affect voice calls via the

385
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,880
ims

386
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:25,839
as a result voiceover lte indirectly

387
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:26,959
protects the network

388
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:29,440
against many of the middle attacks

389
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,360
however our intruder is quite

390
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:34,480
experienced and has obtained access

391
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:37,360
to both the ss7 and diameter networks

392
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:38,480
during the first step

393
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:41,760
the intruder needs to suppress volte

394
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:44,720
for the subscriber they sends a cancel

395
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:45,920
location requesting

396
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:48,560
message on the diameter protocol this

397
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:50,240
message is intended to prohibit

398
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:53,199
subscriber services on the mme node

399
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:56,079
the mme implements the command and sends

400
00:14:56,079 --> 00:14:58,480
a positive response to the source node

401
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:01,040
after that the tag subscriber is

402
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:03,040
automatically switched to the previous

403
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,560
generation network

404
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,639
previous generation network is based on

405
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:08,320
ss7 signaling

406
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,880
to explain the attack i have to talk

407
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:11,360
about

408
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:13,519
one interesting feature of the tcap

409
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:16,000
protocol

410
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:18,160
the component portion may contain more

411
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:19,839
than one map protocol

412
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:22,560
component in this case each map

413
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:23,360
component

414
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:26,320
defines its own operation and subscriber

415
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:28,560
identifiers in these operations

416
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:31,279
might be different when the ss7 firewall

417
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:32,000
inspects

418
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,399
such a double component message it

419
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:36,320
checks the subscriber's identity in the

420
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,279
first component

421
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:40,160
regarding the other data is a long

422
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:42,480
payload not meant to be inspected

423
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,639
let's see how the intruder can use a

424
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:46,800
double map component signaling message

425
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:50,160
to perform a man in the middle attack

426
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:52,399
they craft the double map message in

427
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:53,759
which the first operation

428
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:56,240
is insert subscriber data without a

429
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:58,240
subscriber identifier

430
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,160
and the second operation is delete

431
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:01,279
subscriber data

432
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:04,160
with the target subscriber mc the stp

433
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:06,720
sends this message to the ss7 firewall

434
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:09,279
which inspects the first component only

435
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:10,560
determines that

436
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:13,680
it does not have an identifier and

437
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:16,160
forwards the message to the destination

438
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:18,480
from the msc and vlr's point of view

439
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:21,759
these two operations don't make sense

440
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:23,279
the node has been asked to

441
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:24,880
simultaneously insert

442
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:26,880
and delete data in the subscriber's

443
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:27,920
profile

444
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:31,199
that's why the msc vlr replies with an

445
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:33,759
error message if we pay attention to the

446
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:35,440
details in this response

447
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:38,079
we find that the message type on the

448
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:39,759
pickup layer is continue

449
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:42,000
that means something like i don't

450
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,120
understand you

451
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:45,279
please repeat your request within the

452
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:46,800
same transaction

453
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,800
the intruder proceeds with the

454
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,399
transaction and sends

455
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:53,680
one more double map component message

456
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:55,680
the first component contains an insert

457
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:58,160
subscriber data operation without

458
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:00,399
subscriber identity information the

459
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:01,199
second one

460
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:03,360
also contains insert subscriber data

461
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,359
with the target subscriber mc

462
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:07,119
and spoofed address of the billing

463
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:08,959
system of course

464
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:11,119
this address belongs to the intruder's

465
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:13,679
equipment the ss7 firewall inspects the

466
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:15,520
first component only

467
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:17,919
after which it passes the message onto

468
00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:18,959
the network

469
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:22,000
the msc vlr sends confirmation

470
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,480
for both operations that means the

471
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,079
subscriber's profile

472
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:28,640
has been updated the intruder now just

473
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,720
finalizes the transaction

474
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,400
now the intruder is waiting for the

475
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,760
subscriber to call

476
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:36,799
when the subscriber makes a call the msc

477
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:39,360
vlr sends the initial dp signal message

478
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:41,120
to the intruder's address

479
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:43,679
inserted earlier the intruder sends a

480
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:44,320
connect

481
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:47,360
message with the pbx's number

482
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:49,679
the msc redirects the call to the

483
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:51,520
intruder's pbx

484
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:54,000
after that the intruder redirects the

485
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,760
call to the b subscriber

486
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:58,080
the subscribers have a conversation but

487
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,600
the voice traffic goes

488
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:02,000
through the mail factors equipment so we

489
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:02,720
can see that

490
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,960
even sophisticated attacks like voice

491
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,080
call interception

492
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:10,640
are possible on well protected networks

493
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:12,480
one more case with voice call

494
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:14,559
interception in this case

495
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:17,360
the male factor will attack a modern 4g

496
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:18,000
5g

497
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,320
network the hss contains hlr functions

498
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,400
in order to be compatible with previous

499
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:25,919
network generations

500
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:30,240
such as 2g and 3g the intruder sends an

501
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,400
update location signal message to

502
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,320
register the target subscriber

503
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:37,919
on a fake network note that the message

504
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:38,400
comes

505
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,720
from the ss7 interface after a

506
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,160
successful update location

507
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:45,360
operation voice services become

508
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:49,120
unavailable for the target subscriber

509
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:50,880
when subscriber a calls target

510
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,640
subscriber b and

511
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:55,760
sip invite message comes to the ims

512
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:56,960
system

513
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:59,360
the ims does not know where the call

514
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:01,200
subscriber is located

515
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:04,880
that's why it sends location information

516
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:07,919
request to the hss

517
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:11,360
however the hss knows that subscriber b

518
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:13,280
has been previously registered on a

519
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:14,400
previous generation

520
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:18,160
roaming network the hss sends a provide

521
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:21,200
a roaming number request via ss7

522
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,640
interface to the node

523
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:25,520
where the subscriber has been registered

524
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:27,520
this is a node of the intruder

525
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:30,080
the intruder replies with the pbx

526
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:30,640
address

527
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:33,679
instead of the roaming number and

528
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:37,600
hss returns this data to the ims

529
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:40,960
in location information answer message

530
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:44,240
after that the ims establish a call

531
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:46,799
from the subscriber a to the hacker's

532
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:48,880
pbx

533
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:51,200
what is the next step the intruder could

534
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,360
initiate the second leg of the call

535
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:56,880
to the subscriber b in this case the ims

536
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,720
would request location information from

537
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,559
the hss

538
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:03,520
and the hss would send a provide roman

539
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:04,559
number request

540
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:08,159
to the hacker's ss7 node the request

541
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:11,360
would be looped there is no way for the

542
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:14,080
hacker to do that

543
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:16,400
let's look at two options for what an

544
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:18,799
intruder could do next

545
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:21,360
in the first case the intruder sends an

546
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:23,919
update gprs location signal message

547
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:27,039
on the ss7 network to register packet

548
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:29,120
data service of the target subscriber

549
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:32,799
on a fake 2g 3g roaming network

550
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:36,000
during this operation the hss sends a

551
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,960
cancel location request to the mme that

552
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:39,520
makes

553
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:41,600
packet data service unavailable for the

554
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:42,559
subscriber

555
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:44,960
now subscriber b is without any kind of

556
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,400
mobile service

557
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,799
for 5g mobile networks have an

558
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:49,919
interesting feature

559
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:52,720
mobile devices are in always connected

560
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:53,679
mode

561
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:56,799
signals from from the mobile device

562
00:20:56,799 --> 00:21:00,320
come to the mme but the mme clears the

563
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:02,400
profile of the subscriber

564
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:05,600
this mme should restore the profile it

565
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:06,880
sends

566
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:10,240
an update location request to the hss

567
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:12,559
and the hss sends a profile in the

568
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:13,840
answer

569
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:16,320
now the subscribers profile is restored

570
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:18,000
and all services are

571
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,799
up and running at this point the

572
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:23,039
intruder initiates the second lag of the

573
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:24,400
call

574
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,799
the invite request comes to the ims

575
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:27,679
system

576
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:30,480
and the ims request location information

577
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:32,240
from the hss

578
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:35,039
the subscriber has been registered again

579
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:35,679
so

580
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:38,799
the hss provides ims with a real

581
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:40,159
location information

582
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:42,400
and the call is established two

583
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,080
subscribers are able to talk

584
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:46,080
but their voice traffic goes through the

585
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:48,400
hacker's pbx

586
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,880
in the second meeting attack scenario

587
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,880
the intruder may take advantage

588
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,799
of the connection to the diameter

589
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:56,000
network

590
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,559
they send a cancel location request

591
00:21:58,559 --> 00:21:59,039
message

592
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:02,400
on the diameter protocol just to the mme

593
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:03,679
node

594
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:06,960
the mme clears the subscribers profile

595
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:10,080
now subscriber b is without any kind of

596
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:11,600
mobile service

597
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:14,320
again the always connected mode helps to

598
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:16,240
restore the subscriber's profile

599
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:19,200
now the subscriber's profile is restored

600
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:19,520
and

601
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:23,039
all services are up and running

602
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:25,039
at this point the intruder initiates the

603
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:26,480
second leg of the call

604
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:28,640
the invite request comes to the ims

605
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:29,600
system

606
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:32,320
the ims requests location information

607
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:34,720
from the hss

608
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:37,440
the subscriber has been registered again

609
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:40,080
so the hss provides ims with real

610
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:41,760
location information

611
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,600
and the call is established two

612
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:46,400
subscribers are able to talk but their

613
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:51,440
voice traffic goes through hacker's pbx

614
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:53,840
the third case is about money if an

615
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:55,360
intruder wants to steal money

616
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:57,200
they do not care about the target

617
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:00,000
subscriber the target subscriber can be

618
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,640
any person the intruder sends an update

619
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:03,360
location

620
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:06,320
message to a random subscriber with a

621
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:08,480
random emcee identity

622
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:11,919
from the target operator during the

623
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:13,280
update location procedure the

624
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:14,320
destination shall r

625
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:17,039
sends the corresponding msa's then as a

626
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:17,520
part

627
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:19,600
of the subscriber's profile now the

628
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,600
intruder knows the

629
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:24,880
then pair they generate a

630
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:27,039
create pdp context request signal

631
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:28,720
message of gtp protocol

632
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:32,159
that should contain both identifiers

633
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:34,960
this message initiates a packet data

634
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:38,080
session from a fake roaming registration

635
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:41,360
the gjson replies with the ip address

636
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:43,760
for the user traffic tunneling now the

637
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:45,200
hacker is able to generate

638
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,840
any internet requests as the big team

639
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:49,120
subscriber

640
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:51,919
since the goal of the hacker is money

641
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:52,720
they initiate

642
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:55,840
an http session to a server with premium

643
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:56,400
content

644
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,960
and create a subscription the mobile

645
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:01,279
operator assigns the subscription to the

646
00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:03,600
subscriber's identity as sent

647
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,840
in the create pdp context request

648
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:06,799
message

649
00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:09,200
the more requests the intruder sends the

650
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:12,480
more money they earn

651
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:15,039
all these cases have been tested in the

652
00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:15,520
wild

653
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:17,760
on real mobile networks during security

654
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:18,960
assessments

655
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:21,600
information about these attacks was

656
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:22,640
reported to the

657
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:26,000
gsma fraud and security group the

658
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,559
ss7 firewall bypass technique has been

659
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:29,520
added to the

660
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:32,559
ss7 interconnect security monitoring and

661
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:36,400
firewall guidelines issued by the gsma

662
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,640
fraud and security group the relevant

663
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,400
vulnerability was reported to the

664
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,799
gsma coordinated vulnerability program

665
00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:43,880
in december

666
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:47,200
2018. it has been assigned vulnerability

667
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:49,039
code cbd 2018

668
00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:52,480
or 15. the main causes of

669
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:55,360
signal network issues are architectural

670
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:56,080
flaws

671
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:58,400
in the protocols mistakes in equipment

672
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,760
configuration

673
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:02,960
and sometimes software bugs

674
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:05,840
on the one hand most operators have

675
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:06,559
learned

676
00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:10,000
to withstand ss7 flits connected

677
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,200
with the first two factors but

678
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:15,600
software bugs allow an intruder to

679
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,200
bypass security

680
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:20,000
on the other hand most operators are

681
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,440
still not protected

682
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:24,480
against diameter threats the thing is

683
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:27,039
that in most cases the mobile operator

684
00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:28,559
can protect the network

685
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:31,600
better without extra costs they just

686
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:32,799
need to check

687
00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:34,880
whether their security tools are

688
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:37,360
effective against new vulnerabilities

689
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:39,520
as soon as a new vulnerability is

690
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:41,279
reported we often see

691
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:43,919
that hackers use advanced techniques to

692
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:44,559
bypass

693
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:47,760
protection and perform attacks mobile

694
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:48,480
operators

695
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:50,480
are also advised to use a signal

696
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:52,400
intrusion detection system

697
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,960
along with a signaling firewall in order

698
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:56,960
to block a hostile source

699
00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:00,080
as soon as a treat is detected operators

700
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:02,080
should configure their border security

701
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:03,279
equipment carefully

702
00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:06,400
to block all known vulnerabilities

703
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:09,679
afterwards these three simple actions

704
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:12,559
should be implemented as a constant

705
00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:13,520
process

706
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:15,520
this will help the operator to block

707
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:16,559
hostile

708
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:20,640
activity at the early stages

709
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:25,840
that's all thank you for your attention
