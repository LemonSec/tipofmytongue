1
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:03,120
hi

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:04,720
thank you for joining me today to talk

3
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:06,480
about biometrics and privacy

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:08,639
is it time to face off or is that face

5
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:09,840
up

6
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:12,639
in mid 2019 as you may recall it wasn't

7
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:13,599
that long ago

8
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:16,480
um face app became headline news with a

9
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:17,039
huge

10
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:19,680
concern around security um at the time

11
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:20,720
it was alleged that

12
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:23,680
face app was actually taking uh not only

13
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:25,439
the photos that you chose to upload but

14
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:27,119
also taking photos that were in your

15
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:27,760
photo

16
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:30,240
gallery on your camera on your phone um

17
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:31,840
that they were taking those photos they

18
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:34,239
were uploading them to the cloud

19
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:36,239
they were then transferring those photos

20
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:38,160
across to russia

21
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:40,559
ostensibly to create some sort of giant

22
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:42,480
facial recognition database that then

23
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:44,800
russian authorities would be able to use

24
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:48,800
this all was headline news um and

25
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,800
at the time face up actually responded

26
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:51,840
and they said well

27
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,760
yeah we do actually take photos that you

28
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,600
upload and we do have to put them into

29
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:56,640
the cloud because

30
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,480
we need that processing power in order

31
00:00:58,480 --> 00:00:59,600
to show you what you're going to look

32
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,520
like in 50 years time

33
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:05,280
and so they then went on to say

34
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,439
um that unless you're a user based in

35
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:09,200
russia they weren't transferring your

36
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,720
data through to russia even though their

37
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:11,760
developers and their r

38
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:14,640
d team were russian um they showed their

39
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,479
amazon web services

40
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:18,159
locations they showed where their data

41
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:19,759
centers were

42
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:21,600
and they also confirmed that after 48

43
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,119
hours they

44
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:26,720
were deleting the photos so really

45
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,799
ultimately um i mean aside from the fact

46
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:30,400
that they were a russian company a lot

47
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,479
of the allegations weren't

48
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:36,079
entirely um you know weren't founded

49
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:37,520
and that they weren't using these photos

50
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:39,200
for the nefarious purposes for which

51
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:39,680
people

52
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:42,799
were thinking that they were and it got

53
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:44,399
me thinking

54
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:46,240
how often are we sharing personal

55
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,399
information and biometric data

56
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:49,840
you know our facial recognition as

57
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:52,000
biometric data how often are we sharing

58
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:52,960
that information

59
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:55,360
who are we sharing it with how are we

60
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,960
inadvertently disclosing that

61
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:57,759
information

62
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:00,399
and then if i have done that what can i

63
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:02,960
as an individual do

64
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,880
to keep control of my biometric data

65
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:07,040
it's it's valuable data to me

66
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:10,239
so that's what prompted me to

67
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:12,800
to do this talk and to think about it um

68
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,120
and obviously since then covet has also

69
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,480
come along

70
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:19,040
so before we delve into this topic i

71
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:19,920
just wanted to

72
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,160
say you know who i am um so my name is

73
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:24,239
melissa wingard i'm special counsel at

74
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:26,640
philips ormond fitzpatrick and

75
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,560
we are a specialized intellectual

76
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,840
property firm

77
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,840
i personally have been a lawyer for over

78
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:32,959
15 years

79
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:36,720
i specialize in information technology

80
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,080
law cyber security

81
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,800
privacy um i remember when i was a

82
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,239
junior lawyer

83
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:44,400
baby lawyer privacy wasn't a thing it's

84
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,599
been

85
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:46,959
one of the things that has been so great

86
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:48,400
about technology is not only the

87
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,080
convenience but we've really started to

88
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,160
look at privacy and privacy is coming to

89
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,120
the forefront

90
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,440
um i remember you know when i did start

91
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:56,959
out i had a general counsel who once

92
00:02:56,959 --> 00:02:57,920
said to me

93
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,440
you know not to worry about the privacy

94
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,280
laws because there was no penalties

95
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,040
associated with them but obviously you

96
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,080
know look at what the

97
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,640
gdpr has brought in notifiable data

98
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,720
breaches so you know privacy is

99
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:11,280
it's a really important area of law and

100
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,879
it's something i think we as individuals

101
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:13,440
all

102
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:16,959
are incumbent to um to be responsible

103
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:18,239
for

104
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:21,120
so um i've also worked across asia

105
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:21,680
pacific

106
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,280
um for a number of different

107
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,879
organizations i've

108
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:27,200
had head of legal roles for asia pacific

109
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,400
so i've worked

110
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:31,519
extensively in singapore malaysia

111
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:35,280
indonesia india china

112
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,040
and i care a lot about educating people

113
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:39,599
as to their rights to privacy it's a

114
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:41,440
fundamental human right and we should be

115
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,560
cherishing it

116
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:45,040
and we should be knowing and

117
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,040
understanding what we as individuals

118
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,879
can do we can't fix everything but we

119
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:50,720
can certainly take control over our own

120
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,159
biometric data

121
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:53,519
because don't forget your personal

122
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:55,120
information and your biometric data is

123
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,080
yours

124
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,720
um it may not always be in your control

125
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,640
but it is still yours and i think we

126
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,640
really need to start thinking about what

127
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,400
are we exchanging in return

128
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,640
for giving such a lot of ourselves to

129
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:07,870
organizations

130
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:09,120
[Music]

131
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,480
so let's start at the beginning

132
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,720
biometric data well what is it um so

133
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,159
it's more than just fingerprints i know

134
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:15,120
we're all

135
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,320
you know we think of fingerprints we've

136
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,478
got our phones um

137
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:19,759
everything's got fingerprints out of

138
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:20,959
these days we've all watched mission

139
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:21,600
impossible

140
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,880
iris scans retina scans um so biometric

141
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,000
data falls into two

142
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,639
basic um kind of buckets really it's

143
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:29,680
physiological

144
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,840
which comprises of morphological and

145
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,040
biological

146
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,280
um and then there's also behavioral so

147
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,240
these are

148
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:39,360
those characteristics of an individual

149
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,680
which are distinguishing repeatable

150
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,520
biometric features and which can be

151
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,120
extracted for the purposes of

152
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:48,639
biometric recognition so it's it's more

153
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:50,000
than just

154
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,280
it's more than just your fingerprint

155
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:53,520
it's more than just your face um

156
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:56,160
it can also include your dna it can

157
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,759
conclude

158
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:00,000
what you smell like it can include the

159
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,680
shape of your ear

160
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,840
apparently that's unique to to us it

161
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:04,880
also looks at um

162
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:07,280
gait and walking style that can also be

163
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:09,919
a biometric data

164
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:12,560
vein recognition i mean some of these

165
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,919
are amazing you don't even think about

166
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:14,800
it but

167
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,560
and even your keystroke dynamics so how

168
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,320
you type the way that you type

169
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:21,120
that can be biometric data so when we

170
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,720
start to talk about it i think we need

171
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,800
to think more than just

172
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:27,120
fingerprints facial recognition although

173
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,880
they're obviously the key ones

174
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,479
and i suppose the reason they come about

175
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:32,000
is because they're the ones that can be

176
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,560
used by government law enforcement

177
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:37,039
to recognize us and and they're the ones

178
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:38,560
that are often bringing out the privacy

179
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,080
concerns at the moment because you're

180
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,840
finding law enforcement you know

181
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,360
scanning crowds

182
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,759
um using facial recognition technology

183
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:46,800
in order to

184
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:50,880
to um identify people

185
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:53,520
so why should we care about this

186
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,360
biometric data and privacy

187
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:58,560
um and i think look i think this in a

188
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,120
way

189
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:02,160
um this talk has become even more

190
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:05,199
important since um since the start of

191
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:06,000
the year

192
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,680
we've had covert we we've had a

193
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,600
coronavirus um

194
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,280
you know this whole novel coronavirus

195
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,520
has completely

196
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,440
upended our lives at the moment i mean

197
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,880
we were supposed to be doing this face

198
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:19,759
to face in singapore six months ago and

199
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:23,759
now you've got a video of me um

200
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,520
so but what it's also shown is that

201
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:30,720
we're gonna be moving rapidly like

202
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:33,360
absolutely rapidly towards a touchless

203
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,080
technology

204
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,720
and contactless pathways we're seeking

205
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,720
to find a way to navigate in day-to-day

206
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,160
life that doesn't actually have us

207
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,360
exposed to

208
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:44,800
coronavirus so you know how do we access

209
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:45,680
our offices

210
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:48,000
without touching lifts or without

211
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,520
swiping cards so

212
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:52,240
there's a real push um and a real

213
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,919
acceleration towards the use of

214
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:55,440
biometrics

215
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,199
that i think we need to be aware that

216
00:06:57,199 --> 00:06:59,039
whilst they're looking to solve a public

217
00:06:59,039 --> 00:06:59,599
health

218
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:02,720
um issue the law needs to keep up with

219
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:05,520
that and we also need as individuals to

220
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:08,000
to kind of balance the sharing of our

221
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,120
information as well

222
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,919
so um when you start looking at the

223
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:13,759
privacy laws there are some privacy laws

224
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:15,360
that do speak directly to the concept

225
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,280
that biometric data should be treated as

226
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,560
sensitive data

227
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:21,120
but not all laws are to that stage yet

228
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:21,840
and i guess

229
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,280
one of the things that's concerning is

230
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,560
because you've got technology and

231
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,479
government's use of that technology

232
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:29,759
really outpacing the legislation

233
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:32,000
and we rely as individuals we rely very

234
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,599
heavily on that legislation to provide

235
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:34,319
us with

236
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:36,560
our rights because without the

237
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,080
legislation and the framework within

238
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,360
which to operate

239
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:42,639
we're left with you know taking

240
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:45,199
personal legal action and often that

241
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:45,759
isn't

242
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:47,280
you know there's such an imbalance

243
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,479
between the individual and the

244
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:49,919
organization or the individual and the

245
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:51,440
government that that's not

246
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:54,240
an avenue many of us have we don't have

247
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:57,120
the time we don't have the money

248
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,280
possibly not even the inclination to do

249
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,039
that so

250
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:02,639
i think this is really front of mind at

251
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:04,400
the moment as i said because we're we're

252
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,319
moving towards this touchless tech

253
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:09,360
um there's this is a

254
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,639
slight aside there's a really

255
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:12,800
interesting um animation on the bbc at

256
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,160
the moment about what life might look

257
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,759
like in 2025

258
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:17,599
and it shows a world where you know

259
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:19,759
navigating from home

260
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:22,720
into our offices is is a completely

261
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,080
contactless pathway

262
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:27,599
um so again overlaying what that future

263
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:29,039
looks like with the technology that's

264
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:30,240
required and then

265
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,919
the information that those organizations

266
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:33,679
are going to have about us

267
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:35,039
this is a topic we really need to be

268
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:36,320
concerned about and we need to care

269
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,279
about it

270
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:39,919
um because our biometrics are inherently

271
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:41,039
identifiable

272
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:44,399
um and they're us our biometrics are us

273
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:46,560
my face is me as much as some days i'd

274
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:47,920
like to change it

275
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:51,440
it's not gonna change that easily um

276
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:55,120
so and the issue with this inherently

277
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,959
identifiable aspect of it is that a lot

278
00:08:56,959 --> 00:08:58,480
of our privacy laws even the gold

279
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,600
standard gdpr

280
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,760
relies very very heavily on this concept

281
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,120
of anonymization

282
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,880
so once personal information is

283
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:07,120
anonymized organizations are free to

284
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,560
deal with it how they want to deal with

285
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:09,040
it

286
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:11,200
now my issue with that is that i don't

287
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,440
believe there is a way to

288
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:16,080
fully anonymize biometric data it's

289
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,680
always inherently identifiable

290
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:18,560
information

291
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,560
and even these days there's a school of

292
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,080
thought that says well with quantum

293
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:22,640
computing

294
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,640
is there is there a way to actually

295
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,720
anonymize any kind of data

296
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:29,200
um you know you might pull it apart but

297
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,720
then computers are smart enough to put

298
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,320
it all back together and potentially

299
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,000
make it you know re-identifiable

300
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,200
information so

301
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,640
i think there's some real issues that

302
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,240
need to be navigated um

303
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:41,760
around that and i suppose the

304
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,519
the fundamental issue for us as

305
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:45,440
individuals too is you know there's

306
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:47,120
there's the use of biometrics for the

307
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,560
purpose of identity

308
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:49,920
and there's the use of biometrics for

309
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:52,480
the purposes of authentication now

310
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:55,200
identity is one thing if we're using it

311
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,320
for the purposes of

312
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,880
authentication that's an area we really

313
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,320
need to be thinking quite

314
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:04,640
closely about because once

315
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,480
you know once our passwords are leaked

316
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,079
we can change our password you know you

317
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:09,839
go into have i been phoned and you see

318
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:10,880
whether you've actually

319
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:13,519
had a you know you've had your password

320
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:14,399
or your

321
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:16,320
email account has been hacked and you

322
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,680
can change your email account you can

323
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:19,279
change your password you can

324
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:21,440
use a password manager that you can you

325
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,120
can put controls in place

326
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:25,440
to protect all of that if you're using a

327
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,240
fingerprint

328
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:29,839
or a face or an iris or a retina

329
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:32,160
or the shape of your ear to authenticate

330
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,680
who you are and that information becomes

331
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:34,399
public

332
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:37,680
how do you then get it back you can't so

333
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,920
um whilst today's talk is looking more

334
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:40,880
at

335
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,640
what you as an individual can do in

336
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:45,200
terms of controlling your biometric data

337
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,240
and what people

338
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:48,079
can do with it what organizations can do

339
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:49,440
with it and what the frameworks are

340
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,320
within which

341
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,320
you can you know seek to navigate that

342
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:55,200
world i think there are a few

343
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,519
or a few there's a lot of other issues

344
00:10:57,519 --> 00:10:59,040
that really um

345
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,959
need to be considered about how

346
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:02,959
biometrics are used and how we keep

347
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:06,560
our law keeping pace with it

348
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:10,079
so um what i just quickly want to do now

349
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:12,480
is go through and look this is quite a

350
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:13,600
short talk so

351
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,040
it's not going to be an incredible

352
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,320
detail but i just want to have a high

353
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,920
level look at a couple of comparative

354
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:20,079
jurisdictions to see

355
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:21,440
what some of the countries that are

356
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:24,079
known for using biometric data

357
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:26,959
um significantly you know what laws are

358
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:28,160
in place in those particular

359
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:29,279
jurisdictions and obviously because

360
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:31,040
we're at blackhead asia

361
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:34,079
uh we're looking at singapore china and

362
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:37,040
india um so as i said it's only going to

363
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,240
be at a high level

364
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,680
don't have a lot of time to delve into

365
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,519
the details but we can obviously do that

366
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:43,440
um at another time or if you want to

367
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,800
reach out to me

368
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:48,000
um and the the reason

369
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,360
i thought it would be useful to have a

370
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,880
look at these three and what will come

371
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,560
to at the end is some action items or

372
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,240
some things that you know you can do as

373
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,160
an individual

374
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:57,760
but i guess the fundamental or

375
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,760
underpinning of all of this is

376
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,639
um the laws do change from region to

377
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:03,600
region

378
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,839
we kind of all know that i think there

379
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:07,279
is an expectation these days that

380
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:08,880
because there's been so much media and

381
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:11,120
press about gdpr that gdpr applies

382
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,480
across the board

383
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,720
it doesn't so i think as an individual

384
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:15,600
it's it's

385
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,160
kind of key for us to just at a very

386
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:19,360
base understanding

387
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:22,560
know what country are these people

388
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:23,279
operating in

389
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:24,959
so you know i'm sitting in australia at

390
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:26,959
the moment but if i download an app on

391
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:28,160
my phone and i'm giving them some

392
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,120
information

393
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,720
where are they based they could be based

394
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,079
in singapore they could be based in the

395
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:33,120
usa

396
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:35,360
it could be anywhere in the world so

397
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,480
just knowing that

398
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,079
that jurisdiction and some of those

399
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:39,440
differences i think is a really

400
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:40,160
important thing

401
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,480
for us as individuals to do um and i

402
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,240
think we also need to recognize as well

403
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,880
that there are vast differences between

404
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:49,600
the laws that apply to governments when

405
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,600
they collect your personal information

406
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,240
um

407
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,920
and your biometric data when private

408
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:55,839
organizations do it and also when your

409
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:57,519
employer does it

410
00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:00,639
so we have a few different buckets of

411
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:03,360
people per se that are collecting and

412
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,880
using the information and the laws don't

413
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:08,000
apply consistently across all of them

414
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,079
so so singapore um

415
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:16,079
is actually um

416
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:17,839
so singapore has quite a number of

417
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:19,519
pieces of legislation but thankfully

418
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:21,360
they're all

419
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:24,880
um in the same in the same space so

420
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,240
singapore has the personal data

421
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,399
protection act and that is the

422
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:30,160
legislation which covers how

423
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:33,440
private organizations can um

424
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,360
uh collect your information use your

425
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:37,040
information disclose it

426
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:40,320
store it so obviously the the pdpa puts

427
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:43,279
restrictions on organizations as to um

428
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:45,839
you know what's required for consent

429
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:47,199
um how long they can keep your

430
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:49,360
information for after they

431
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:52,000
no longer need to use it so all of the i

432
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,360
guess all of the normal

433
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:54,880
things that you think about when you

434
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,800
think about privacy laws

435
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:00,079
um the the pdpa also does um

436
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:02,160
specifically note that biometric data is

437
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,760
personal data

438
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:06,639
it calls out faces or facial recognition

439
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:07,519
fingerprints

440
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:10,720
dna and

441
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,160
there are a number of avenues for

442
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:13,839
redress under the pdpa

443
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:15,600
for individuals if you think an

444
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,440
organization is using your information

445
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,959
or you just want to find out

446
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:20,320
how they're using it or you think it

447
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:23,120
might be wrong um so there are avenues

448
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,160
to

449
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:27,199
you know contact the organization that

450
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:28,399
has your information

451
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:32,079
ask for corrections um

452
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:34,160
you know find out how they've you know

453
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:35,600
how they use it in accordance with what

454
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,360
they said they were going to use it for

455
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:39,519
um at this point i'd just like to note

456
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:41,440
there's no right to erasure in singapore

457
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,440
so you can ask for correction but you

458
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,800
can't ask for them to erase your

459
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:45,920
information

460
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:49,839
um which which isn't necessarily all

461
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:51,279
that helpful but

462
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:53,760
um the the right to erasure is i

463
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,199
actually think are very important

464
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:56,880
or the right to be forgotten is is a

465
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,880
very important i think aspect of privacy

466
00:14:58,880 --> 00:14:59,440
law

467
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,279
i think us as individuals need to have

468
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:02,639
the right to be able to say to an

469
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:03,839
organization or to

470
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:05,760
you know someone using our biometric

471
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:08,000
data i no longer consent to you having

472
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,680
that please delete it permanently

473
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:12,720
um however it's really a it's a concept

474
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:13,440
that's come out

475
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,760
more of the european union so it's

476
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:16,800
enshrined in the

477
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:19,279
gdpr and as we'll see you know india's

478
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:20,880
looking at it as part of their new bill

479
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:23,600
but um not all countries have that right

480
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:24,000
so

481
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,279
australia doesn't either you have the

482
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:27,040
right to ask for a copy of your

483
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,399
information you have the ask you have

484
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:30,480
the right to ask for it to be corrected

485
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:33,440
um but not necessarily for deletion and

486
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:34,079
sometimes

487
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:37,120
it's the deletion that you want so um

488
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:40,480
if you've you know um

489
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:43,199
uh if you've gone to the organization

490
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:44,800
and you haven't gotten any kind of

491
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:47,199
remedy that you're happy with there is

492
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:47,839
in

493
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:49,519
singapore the personal data protection

494
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:51,440
commissioner um

495
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:54,959
so that is an avenue um

496
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:57,839
for interestingly both private sector

497
00:15:57,839 --> 00:15:58,720
organizations

498
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,399
and government agencies or public

499
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:02,399
agencies so this is where we're talking

500
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:04,160
about this divergence between

501
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:06,480
you know the law for organizations and

502
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,880
the law for governments um singapore

503
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,320
kindly has this all set out quite

504
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,240
clearly uh well

505
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:16,000
as clear as you can in some respects so

506
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,920
public agencies themselves are not

507
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:19,360
governed by the pdpa

508
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:20,720
they actually are governed by another

509
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,320
piece of legislation called the public

510
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,800
sector governance act

511
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,399
and under this act what it says is

512
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:28,560
public agencies need to comply with the

513
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:30,160
minister's directions around data

514
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:32,320
protection so the minister will hand

515
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,120
down

516
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:35,279
data protection regulations and it's up

517
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:36,959
to the public agencies to implement

518
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:37,759
those

519
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:39,040
so and when we're talking public

520
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,480
agencies we're also talking things like

521
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:41,920
um the singaporean

522
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:43,600
uh immigration and checkpoint authority

523
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:44,639
so when you get your fingerprints

524
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:45,360
scanned

525
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:46,639
or i wish i'd gotten my fingerprint

526
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:49,120
scanned to go into the conference

527
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:51,759
um that those sorts of public agencies

528
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:53,759
collecting that biometric data

529
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:57,759
um so they've got a separate set of

530
00:16:57,759 --> 00:16:59,839
rules that they need to comply with

531
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:01,519
um and there's a curious thing in

532
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:03,199
singapore well i find it

533
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:05,839
kind of curious um in that if a public

534
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:06,720
sector agency

535
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:07,839
is found to have breached their

536
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:10,160
obligations in relation to

537
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,599
protecting your personal information

538
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:13,679
your biometric data it's not actually

539
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:15,439
the public agency that gets in trouble

540
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:16,959
for that it's actually the law

541
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:19,280
the the um the official the public

542
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:20,079
official

543
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:22,400
who is responsible for the breach that

544
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,760
actually is liable

545
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,679
personally and individually for that

546
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:27,520
that breach of um

547
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:31,360
of privacy so given the fact that data

548
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:33,280
moves throughout so many people

549
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:35,919
um it's it's not clear to me on the face

550
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:37,440
of it how that's actually going to apply

551
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:38,720
in practice but

552
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:41,280
um it is still a remedy though and it is

553
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:42,799
it has the benefit of being

554
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:46,080
an individual um i guess it becomes an

555
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:47,200
individual sanction

556
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,880
so i suppose the thinking and the hope

557
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,480
is that then those individuals working

558
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,160
within those public agencies

559
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:54,400
will actually hold the information more

560
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,240
carefully and manage it more closely

561
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:57,679
than perhaps they would have if there

562
00:17:57,679 --> 00:17:58,480
wasn't any

563
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:01,840
personal responsibility

564
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,520
so in singapore

565
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,360
whether the information is held by a

566
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:09,039
government agency a public agency

567
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:11,679
or a private company if you've contacted

568
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:13,200
those organizations and this is always

569
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,720
what the commissioner says to do first

570
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,559
contact the organization and see if you

571
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:19,360
can work out a remedy with them directly

572
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:20,640
if you've done that and you haven't been

573
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,240
able to come to some sort of conclusion

574
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:23,200
or any kind of

575
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,760
outcome that you're happy with you can

576
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:27,520
still make a complaint to

577
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:30,559
the commissioner um

578
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:31,919
the commissioner can for private

579
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:34,000
organizations they can impose fines they

580
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:34,400
can

581
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:37,039
um issue orders uh so they and they do

582
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:38,320
quite frequently if you

583
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:39,760
if you've got a smart moment and you're

584
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:42,720
interested um their

585
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,400
their complaints that they consider are

586
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,840
all on their site so you can actually go

587
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:47,200
through and see what they're thinking

588
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:47,840
which is

589
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:49,039
which is really good i like that

590
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:51,360
transparency about it um

591
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:52,880
and it also gives you as an individual a

592
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,240
little bit more of a sense of okay well

593
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:56,320
if i were to make a complaint what would

594
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:58,000
be the likely outcome what's reasonable

595
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,320
what's not reasonable

596
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:03,039
so they can take that action against

597
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:04,400
private organizations

598
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,720
now the singaporean government has come

599
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,080
out and said that if you've got an issue

600
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,360
with public agencies

601
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:11,280
around personal information biometric

602
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,880
data

603
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,400
you can make a complaint to the

604
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,080
commissioner

605
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:19,280
but practically

606
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:20,559
still wanting to see how that's going to

607
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:21,919
play out because obviously the

608
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:23,679
commissioner doesn't have any authority

609
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:26,559
necessarily over those public agencies

610
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:27,600
but certainly the fact that the

611
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,679
government is saying go and talk to the

612
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:31,200
commissioner suggest that there would be

613
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,720
some sort of

614
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,799
ability of the commissioner to at least

615
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:36,640
work with both the agency and the

616
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:38,000
individual in question to

617
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,559
find a resolution um that works with

618
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:42,640
respect to that personal information so

619
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,240
i think it's good that there is an

620
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:46,000
avenue um

621
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,200
there's obviously because without the

622
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,720
without the commissioner there as an

623
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,240
individual your rights would probably be

624
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:53,360
limited to bringing

625
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:55,520
um commencing proceedings against the

626
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,600
public agency themselves or trying to go

627
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:00,320
to mediation with them which

628
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:02,720
you know that that brings us back to

629
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,720
that imbalance of power between

630
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,960
organizations and individuals we don't

631
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,640
have the resources we don't have the

632
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:09,039
time

633
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:12,720
so that's not a not always an ideal

634
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:15,120
answer

635
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,760
so look overall at least on paper

636
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:18,880
singapore has

637
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:20,960
a good framework to operate within for

638
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,960
individuals to be able to seek

639
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:25,600
redress and to attempt to use that

640
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:26,880
framework to be able to control your

641
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:27,919
biometric data

642
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:31,760
so it's worthwhile and i come to this

643
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:33,039
again at the end

644
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:36,480
get individual um just you know even if

645
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:37,840
you've got a spare five minutes have a

646
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:39,760
look at the pdpc's website

647
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:41,200
there's a lot of information on there

648
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,039
there's great things about what your

649
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:45,200
rights are there's some template letters

650
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,679
um so they want to help you with this

651
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:49,039
it's recognized that it's a

652
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:51,520
fundamentally important area of the law

653
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:54,799
um and there are provisions in there so

654
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:57,120
it's worth just look no one's gonna

655
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,080
expect you to be

656
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:59,919
a lawyer on this but at least if you're

657
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:02,240
aware to say oh hang on

658
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:04,960
that organization took my information it

659
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,720
appears like they're still using it and

660
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,880
i haven't bought anything off them for

661
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,320
years or they're selling my data when

662
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:11,440
they told me that they weren't going to

663
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:12,640
be selling my data

664
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:15,520
that gives you those avenues you know to

665
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:17,120
to do something about it and to bring

666
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:18,559
some of the power back

667
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:23,840
to you um so moving along

668
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:27,360
we are going to india now

669
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:29,840
india is quite fascinating because as

670
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:31,440
most of you will know it's also

671
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,360
the government itself is one of the i

672
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:34,799
think has the largest database in the

673
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:36,480
world of biometric data

674
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:39,120
um and they use it a lot um as part of

675
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:40,880
uh you know their system

676
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:43,039
of laws and and a way to provide people

677
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:44,880
with government services so

678
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:48,720
it's it's a it's a very fundamentally

679
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:49,679
interesting

680
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:51,440
place to have a look at personal

681
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:52,960
information as well because

682
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,799
we also have to acknowledge that in a

683
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:56,480
lot of countries this whole concept of a

684
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:58,400
right to privacy is a relatively new

685
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,799
concept it's not something that's been

686
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:03,280
there for a long time and historically

687
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:03,919
india

688
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:05,280
has been one of those countries and

689
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:07,440
china is too that that they haven't had

690
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,200
comprehensive data protection or privacy

691
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,640
legislation

692
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:13,679
india has relied on um

693
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:16,080
the information technology act of 2000

694
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:18,000
and the information technology and bear

695
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:18,400
with me

696
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,559
reasonable security practices procedures

697
00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:22,400
and sensitive personal information or

698
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:25,039
personal data or information of 2011

699
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:26,880
those rules so they kind of collectively

700
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:29,200
called the i.t act and the it rules

701
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,720
thankfully i wouldn't want to read that

702
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:33,120
out every time um

703
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:35,440
and so they're the things that have

704
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:37,120
tended to govern data protection and

705
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:38,480
privacy in india but

706
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:40,720
it's really it's probably really more

707
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:42,400
data protection and i think we tend to

708
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,760
use data protection privacy

709
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:45,600
interchangeably

710
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,520
but they're not always interchangeable

711
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:49,600
um they do you know fundamentally

712
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:52,960
different areas really um and

713
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:55,200
it's been recognized that the the i.t

714
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,400
act and the it

715
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,480
rules um have had significant

716
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:00,559
limitations um again they're not

717
00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:01,840
they're not specifically designed for

718
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:03,679
privacy they were designed for data as

719
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:04,960
their name suggests they've come out of

720
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:05,440
i.t

721
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:09,200
legislation um not not privacy not this

722
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:11,039
sort of you know fundamental human right

723
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:11,520
that's

724
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,280
if you look at where the gdpr has come

725
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:15,520
from you know the eu the european union

726
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:17,760
enshrined privacy as a fundamental human

727
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:18,320
right

728
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:21,200
i think back in the 50s so this is a

729
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:23,200
different world that we're operating in

730
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,000
here so

731
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,159
the it act it rules not specifically

732
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:27,440
designed for privacy

733
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:29,120
the scope and applicability of it is

734
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:31,039
very narrow it only applies

735
00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:33,440
to private organizations to which you've

736
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:35,360
got a contractual arrangement with them

737
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:36,480
so if they're collecting your data

738
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,320
without a contractual arrangement the

739
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:39,280
law doesn't apply

740
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:40,799
it also is a very clear that it doesn't

741
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:43,279
apply to any kind of government or state

742
00:23:43,279 --> 00:23:44,880
agencies

743
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:48,960
that are using information um

744
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:52,799
so however india is changing though so

745
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:54,960
in 2017 there was a landmark judgment in

746
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:56,880
the supreme court of india

747
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:59,200
um where the court actually held that

748
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,640
the right to privacy

749
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,480
is a fundamental right under the instant

750
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:05,360
indian indian constitution

751
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:07,039
and because it was considered a part of

752
00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:08,960
the right to life and the right to

753
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,880
personal liberty

754
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:15,279
so in justice ks put aswami and others

755
00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:18,080
and the union of india in 2017 the court

756
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:19,120
actually stated that

757
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:20,880
every person should have the right to

758
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:24,320
control commercial use of their identity

759
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:25,840
and the right of individuals to

760
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:27,679
exclusively commercially exploit their

761
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:29,840
identity and personal information

762
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:31,440
to control the information that is

763
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:33,840
available out about them on the internet

764
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:36,080
and to disseminate certain personal

765
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:38,799
information for limited purposes

766
00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:41,520
actually emanate from that right privacy

767
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:41,840
so

768
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:45,200
that was that was a landmark case that

769
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:46,400
was the first time

770
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:47,919
you know this has been recognized as a

771
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:50,480
fundamental human right in india um and

772
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:52,159
that was you know quite a significant

773
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:53,840
change in thinking

774
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:57,360
but the um because the court was looking

775
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:58,960
at it from the concept of the indian

776
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:00,159
constitution

777
00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:02,080
what they said was that that fundamental

778
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:03,440
right is

779
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:05,760
only enforceable against the government

780
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:07,760
and government instrumentalities

781
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:09,760
they actually said look in order for for

782
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:11,600
private organizations to be bound by

783
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,120
this right to privacy and this

784
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:14,480
fundamental human right there needed to

785
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:16,080
be legislation involved

786
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:17,600
so the government needed to take the

787
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:19,120
fact that the court had decided that

788
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:21,200
there was a right to privacy

789
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:23,840
in the indian constitution and then

790
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:25,840
translate that into laws that would

791
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:28,880
apply to private organizations

792
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:32,960
so as a result um that precipitated

793
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:34,880
uh the personal data protection bill

794
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:36,640
which came out at the end of last year

795
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:38,720
december 2019

796
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:41,840
it was supposed to be passed this

797
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:44,480
hashtag covered um i think it's still

798
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:46,320
going through

799
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:48,080
when it does eventually get passed it'll

800
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:49,760
then be implemented in a phased manner

801
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:51,200
but basically the new bill

802
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:53,200
will establish a data protection

803
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:54,960
authority in india

804
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:56,960
have broad reach including to persons

805
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,480
who are based outside of india but who

806
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:00,799
are doing business in india

807
00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:02,240
it will set out the principles for

808
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:05,360
processing personal information

809
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:07,919
it will require consent for collection

810
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:09,039
and

811
00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:11,760
it also specifies biometric data as a

812
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:12,480
sensitive

813
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:14,320
as a type of sensitive information and

814
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:16,000
what that will mean is that there is

815
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,279
a higher threshold required for

816
00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:21,360
biometric data because it is considered

817
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:23,120
sensitive information

818
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:24,799
so that will have more onerous consent

819
00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:26,400
requirements i think it will require

820
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:29,520
um uh affirmative action to consent to

821
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:31,360
giving your biometric data

822
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:32,720
um there'll obviously be tighter

823
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:34,880
controls on storage how it's used and

824
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:35,440
how it's

825
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:38,720
disclosed um which is

826
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,960
which i think is a great step forward um

827
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:42,799
then they also have concluded in the new

828
00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:44,400
builds right to be forgotten

829
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:47,120
so there will be um assuming it goes

830
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:48,320
through in its current form there will

831
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:49,679
be express rights for

832
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:51,760
data subjects to actually restrict the

833
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:54,720
ongoing use or disclosure of

834
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:56,320
personal information which would include

835
00:26:56,320 --> 00:27:00,000
that biometric information

836
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:03,919
however it's not a rainbows and sunshine

837
00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:05,840
there are many exemptions and i think we

838
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:07,679
need to be really aware of that

839
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:10,000
um it doesn't apply to anonymized data

840
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,360
so coming back to what i was saying

841
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:13,120
earlier there's some issues with this

842
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:15,120
disconnect between biometric data and

843
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:16,640
anonymization

844
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,720
um the government has also included

845
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,240
obviously exemptions for themselves

846
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:22,000
so they can process personal information

847
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,919
and biometric data for reasons such as

848
00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:26,240
law enforcement and national security

849
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:28,320
now obviously the government's deciding

850
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:29,600
what national security and law

851
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,120
enforcement are which would then govern

852
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:32,000
how they use it

853
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:36,159
so one would assume that they will

854
00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:37,760
that that's possibly a mechanism that

855
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:39,919
can be used to to enable the government

856
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:41,520
to undertake

857
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:44,799
actions that they see fit so um

858
00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:46,880
still a bit of a wait and see on india

859
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:49,679
in that respect

860
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:53,440
so if we move into china um

861
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:56,399
china is yet another patchwork of laws

862
00:27:56,399 --> 00:27:56,960
rules

863
00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:00,320
regulations guidance notes it's

864
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:03,279
very fractured the law around privacy

865
00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:05,440
private organizations are governed by a

866
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:06,799
number of different things so you've got

867
00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:08,159
the cyber security law

868
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:10,240
there's an e-commerce law there's the

869
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:12,399
information security technology personal

870
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:14,399
information security specification which

871
00:28:14,399 --> 00:28:14,799
was

872
00:28:14,799 --> 00:28:17,840
as a 2018 version and i think they're

873
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:19,840
in the process of finalizing a 2020

874
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:21,600
version um

875
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:24,720
and whilst the specifications

876
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:26,640
the law is binding the specifications

877
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,480
aren't binding but the specifications

878
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:30,159
are seen as highly persuasive

879
00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:33,600
so there's quite um it's

880
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:36,720
quite a jungle to navigate um and i

881
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:37,360
don't

882
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:39,120
i don't propose to go through it all in

883
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:40,559
this talk because we don't have a lot of

884
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:42,240
time to talk about in detail

885
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:44,960
and if you do any reading on the chinese

886
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:46,960
privacy laws you'll see that there are

887
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:50,399
multiple different um topic areas

888
00:28:50,399 --> 00:28:52,320
and there are different laws in

889
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:54,000
different sectors um

890
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,840
there's no overarching supervisory

891
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:59,360
authority

892
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:02,720
so the thing to really be aware of in

893
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:03,200
china

894
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:05,120
is because you don't have one

895
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:06,559
overarching piece of legislation you

896
00:29:06,559 --> 00:29:08,159
don't have one overarching privacy

897
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:09,440
commissioner

898
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:11,760
it's really a matter of understanding

899
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:13,279
what is the organization that is

900
00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:14,240
collecting my data

901
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:15,600
do they fall within a particular

902
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:17,840
regulated sector so network operators

903
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:18,240
are

904
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:20,320
um or i.t or i'm sorry internet

905
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:22,000
operators are governed by

906
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,840
the cyber cyber space administration of

907
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:27,360
china um

908
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:31,279
and so you can use them in some

909
00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:32,080
instances

910
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:34,640
but again it's they're very narrow and

911
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:38,399
quite complex to try to navigate um

912
00:29:38,399 --> 00:29:40,080
there are certain guidelines that do

913
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:41,919
deal with biometric data

914
00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:43,840
per se and they do call it out as being

915
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:45,679
sensitive data

916
00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:48,000
and then requiring additional controls

917
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,120
around the collection

918
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:52,000
consent storage dissemination all those

919
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,520
types of things but

920
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:56,320
again that's not in the law necessarily

921
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:58,000
these are contained in other guidelines

922
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,080
that are handed down by various

923
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:04,640
organizations and and bodies um

924
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:07,360
the the cyber security law that i was

925
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:08,960
just talking about that sort of applies

926
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:09,360
to

927
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:11,679
internet operators um that does have a

928
00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:12,880
right to be forgotten

929
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:14,799
but only to the extent that a network

930
00:30:14,799 --> 00:30:17,200
operator is in violation of

931
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:18,960
the law or of your agreement with them

932
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:20,399
so you can go to them and say well hang

933
00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:21,520
on you said that you're only going to

934
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:23,200
use this for x y and z and you've now

935
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:24,320
used it for

936
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:27,360
a but um

937
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:28,960
that's the only time you can really ask

938
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,399
for that right to be

939
00:30:30,399 --> 00:30:32,000
forgotten or the right for your data to

940
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,520
be deleted so if they've just

941
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:34,799
they've done exactly what they said they

942
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:37,600
were going to do there's no

943
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:41,440
um there's no real avenues for that so

944
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:43,760
i think to be fair overall the current

945
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:45,600
laws in india

946
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:48,720
china the current laws in china um don't

947
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:50,320
provide a great deal of protection

948
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:52,799
from an individual perspective um you

949
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:55,200
know no supervisory authority there's

950
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:57,360
very little in the way of significant

951
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:59,039
punishment for any breaches

952
00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:01,679
um of the laws um and the courts have

953
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:02,960
been quite inconsistent

954
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:05,039
in their findings around privacy cases

955
00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:06,000
so

956
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:09,039
um whilst there are moves to make

957
00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:12,080
you know um for china to make changes to

958
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:13,440
the various laws i think that there's

959
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:14,880
new civil codes that are looking to

960
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:16,799
enshrine some of the rights to privacy

961
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:18,080
and also the right for your information

962
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:18,640
to be

963
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:20,559
protected there's also a new data

964
00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:22,720
security law that's being considered

965
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:24,880
but it's not clear on the face of it how

966
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:26,320
that would interact with any personal

967
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:27,760
information because it seems more

968
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:28,799
focused at

969
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:32,320
tech companies collecting data um so

970
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:34,799
there's still a few inconsistencies that

971
00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:37,279
make it quite a complicated patchwork

972
00:31:37,279 --> 00:31:41,200
um to try to navigate

973
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:45,360
um and obviously one of the the big

974
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:47,360
issues i suppose flaws in any of this

975
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:48,880
legislation is that by and large the

976
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:50,240
government isn't subject to any

977
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:51,760
regulations when it comes to the

978
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:54,799
collection of biometric data

979
00:31:54,799 --> 00:32:01,840
so it's a it's another wait and see um

980
00:32:04,410 --> 00:32:06,080
[Music]

981
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:08,720
so what does all of this mean for us as

982
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:09,440
individuals

983
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:10,960
what can we do i know i feel like i've

984
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:13,200
just painted a hopeless picture

985
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:16,240
for some some jurisdictions um

986
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:17,679
but i guess what i wanted to come to

987
00:32:17,679 --> 00:32:19,200
just in the last few minutes of this

988
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:19,600
talk

989
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:21,919
is what i see is the actions that us as

990
00:32:21,919 --> 00:32:22,799
individuals

991
00:32:22,799 --> 00:32:25,919
um can take and what are the some of the

992
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:27,440
things that are within our control

993
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:30,240
so and when i was researching i found

994
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:31,600
this great quote and i just

995
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:34,559
wanted to i can't even pretend it's mine

996
00:32:34,559 --> 00:32:35,440
it's a

997
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:36,799
i think it's exactly what i want to say

998
00:32:36,799 --> 00:32:38,640
which is that rather than relying on

999
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:40,399
companies to safeguard our data or on

1000
00:32:40,399 --> 00:32:42,159
governments to regulate its use it's

1001
00:32:42,159 --> 00:32:43,919
incumbent on each of us to question the

1002
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:45,679
steady trickle of our biological

1003
00:32:45,679 --> 00:32:46,559
information

1004
00:32:46,559 --> 00:32:48,080
into the hands of profit leg

1005
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:49,840
corporations

1006
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:51,760
and i'm as guilty as everyone so you

1007
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:53,679
know no judgement here

1008
00:32:53,679 --> 00:32:56,480
but um so what can you do and these are

1009
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:57,519
some of the things that i've started to

1010
00:32:57,519 --> 00:32:59,200
implement since i've really become aware

1011
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:01,360
of just how much biometric data is being

1012
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:02,720
collected so

1013
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:04,320
really think about who's collecting your

1014
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:05,760
biometric data what are they going to

1015
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:07,440
take it for

1016
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:09,600
read their privacy policy i know not

1017
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:11,200
sexy not cool

1018
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:12,399
no one's going to want to sit with me at

1019
00:33:12,399 --> 00:33:14,480
the bar after this having you know said

1020
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:16,880
yeah let's go read privacy policies

1021
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:18,480
and you don't even need to read all of

1022
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:20,640
it just read the section that talks

1023
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:21,679
about

1024
00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:24,320
we're collecting your information for

1025
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:26,640
whatever the purpose may be

1026
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:29,600
we are going to use it to do this and

1027
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:30,480
these are the people we're going to

1028
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:31,519
disclose it to

1029
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:33,279
and really depending on what the

1030
00:33:33,279 --> 00:33:35,039
information is it should be saying

1031
00:33:35,039 --> 00:33:36,640
we're not going to disclose it to anyone

1032
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:39,120
other than our organization

1033
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:41,039
um and this is also where concealed data

1034
00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:42,399
practices start coming because when you

1035
00:33:42,399 --> 00:33:43,279
read privacy

1036
00:33:43,279 --> 00:33:44,799
policies you'll start to see that what

1037
00:33:44,799 --> 00:33:46,640
people will do is say we will provide

1038
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:48,480
your information to any third party that

1039
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:50,080
we feel is necessary to know

1040
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:52,000
um or even would just provide it to any

1041
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,279
third party that provides us with

1042
00:33:53,279 --> 00:33:54,159
services

1043
00:33:54,159 --> 00:33:56,640
i mean that's incredibly broad who knows

1044
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:58,799
how far that could extend to so

1045
00:33:58,799 --> 00:34:00,240
just have a look at that make sure

1046
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:02,080
you're comfortable with

1047
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:03,440
what they're gonna do with your data and

1048
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:05,360
just take a little mental note of like

1049
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:07,200
who the privacy officer is and how you

1050
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:08,639
can contact them if you need to do

1051
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:09,599
something

1052
00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:12,320
um it's useful not everyone will have a

1053
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:14,079
privacy policy and it's certainly not

1054
00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:16,000
you know legislated everywhere but

1055
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,918
it's just something you know as i said

1056
00:34:17,918 --> 00:34:19,520
skip the start skip end just

1057
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:21,359
look at the important bit in the middle

1058
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:24,239
um and then use that to assess whether

1059
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:25,599
what you're getting in return the

1060
00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:26,879
services you're getting in return the

1061
00:34:26,879 --> 00:34:28,159
goods you're getting in return

1062
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:30,639
the joy you're getting in return is

1063
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:32,560
worth the potential that you're about to

1064
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:32,879
give

1065
00:34:32,879 --> 00:34:35,520
your facial recognition you know your

1066
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:36,159
face

1067
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:37,760
photos of your face to other

1068
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:39,520
organizations so

1069
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:43,199
look it's not always possible to

1070
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:46,879
um to find an alternate solution or find

1071
00:34:46,879 --> 00:34:48,239
one that doesn't require you giving out

1072
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:49,839
heaps of personal information

1073
00:34:49,839 --> 00:34:51,199
but it's just sometimes having that

1074
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:53,040
awareness of like okay

1075
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:55,679
is is the amount of data i'm giving them

1076
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:57,119
really worthwhile

1077
00:34:57,119 --> 00:34:59,520
to me um am i getting something in

1078
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:01,359
return for which i'm comfortable and i'm

1079
00:35:01,359 --> 00:35:02,960
comfortable that

1080
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:04,400
the organization i'm giving my

1081
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:06,320
information to is going to control it

1082
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:07,599
they're going to use it carefully

1083
00:35:07,599 --> 00:35:08,880
they're going to do what they say

1084
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:10,720
they're going to do and if they don't

1085
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:12,640
i know exactly what my ramification like

1086
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:14,400
sorry what my recourse is for that i

1087
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:15,040
know

1088
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:18,560
what i can do about it um

1089
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:20,400
so as i said right to be forgotten i'm a

1090
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:22,079
big advocate for this i really do think

1091
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:23,359
that we should be looking at

1092
00:35:23,359 --> 00:35:25,280
our privacy laws get more prescriptive

1093
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:26,560
laws in place

1094
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:28,160
but that's probably another talk for

1095
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:30,400
another day um

1096
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:33,920
and as i said the

1097
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:35,599
it's probably something we think of less

1098
00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:37,680
um but this whole idea around our

1099
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:39,440
elected representatives

1100
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:41,760
start to look at what your mps your you

1101
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:43,359
know your members of parliament

1102
00:35:43,359 --> 00:35:45,760
um start to have a look at what your

1103
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:47,359
government representatives are doing

1104
00:35:47,359 --> 00:35:49,119
your elected representatives do they

1105
00:35:49,119 --> 00:35:50,960
have thoughts on privacy do they align

1106
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:52,800
with your views on privacy

1107
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,079
um there's a whole lot of things that go

1108
00:35:54,079 --> 00:35:55,760
into our voting decisions but i think

1109
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:57,119
that should be one that we start to

1110
00:35:57,119 --> 00:35:58,640
really look at it's like did the elected

1111
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:00,160
representatives align with my

1112
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:02,079
thinking on how important my personal

1113
00:36:02,079 --> 00:36:03,280
information is

1114
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:06,160
um you know and because i do think there

1115
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:07,119
is this world where we

1116
00:36:07,119 --> 00:36:08,880
need to we need to balance this

1117
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:10,320
disconnect between

1118
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:11,839
the rights of individuals and the power

1119
00:36:11,839 --> 00:36:14,240
of organizations um and the people that

1120
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:15,760
can do that the people that can shift

1121
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:17,040
that balance

1122
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:19,839
is our is our government um so i think

1123
00:36:19,839 --> 00:36:21,440
the democratic process can be quite

1124
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:22,880
important in this even though it's

1125
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:24,880
it's it's the long game there's no

1126
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:26,160
immediate gratification

1127
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:28,560
here um and then obviously the last one

1128
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:29,520
is

1129
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:31,200
where there are regulators or

1130
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:32,960
supervisory authorities that are in

1131
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:33,839
place

1132
00:36:33,839 --> 00:36:35,920
um use the resources that they have

1133
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:37,599
available to you because they're also

1134
00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:39,200
in that role of trying to shift the

1135
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:40,640
balance as well

1136
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:43,440
um and they're trying to make that a bit

1137
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:45,040
more of a level playing field

1138
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:47,279
so

1139
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:50,480
i guess the final note and thank you so

1140
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:51,760
much for spending this time with me i

1141
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:53,119
really appreciate it but my final

1142
00:36:53,119 --> 00:36:56,000
thought on this is just empower yourself

1143
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,960
know what you're willing to share know

1144
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:00,400
what you're willing to do to protect

1145
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:02,560
your personal information

1146
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:06,480
thank you so much
