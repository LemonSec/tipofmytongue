1
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:04,480
hello

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:07,520
virtual friend my name is emilio and i'm

3
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:08,720
a hacker

4
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:12,080
i enjoy playing with the networks towel

5
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:15,040
protocols electronics and also 3d

6
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:16,079
printing

7
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:18,160
i present tools at various conferences

8
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:19,760
around asia

9
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:23,039
europe and america i'm originally from

10
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:24,720
argentina

11
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:27,279
that's a reason my argentinian english

12
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:28,720
and i'm living in japan

13
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:33,119
so i'm one hour ahead of singapore

14
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:36,960
this talk is called misuse of tns

15
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:39,920
the second most used protocol right this

16
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:40,239
is

17
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:42,879
based on layer 4 so the first most used

18
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:45,360
protocol with the http and hence

19
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:48,239
dns will be the second one dns been a

20
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:49,920
while

21
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:54,000
1987 rfc 1033 3435

22
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,280
been out so i've been attacked and

23
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:00,399
use a lot basically so

24
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:02,559
i will give you an overview of the

25
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:04,239
attacks in the past currently on the

26
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:05,920
past and

27
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:08,400
i split it in category like server side

28
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,320
client-side and protocol

29
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,720
so from the server side we have buffer

30
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:13,920
overflows

31
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:16,400
we have a denial of service distributed

32
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:19,920
denial of service amplification attacks

33
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:22,479
on the client side we have a cachet

34
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:23,840
poisson

35
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:26,000
man in the middle we also have a dns

36
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:26,960
rebind

37
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:29,360
which is useful to access internal

38
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:30,560
websites

39
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,799
via the client right and then the

40
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:33,759
protocol itself

41
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:36,320
we i don't know if you remember but we

42
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:37,759
used to be able to transfer

43
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:41,040
zones from a dns open and misconfigure

44
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,159
bind back in the days and these days we

45
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:46,079
have more common tunneling and command

46
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:47,200
and control whereas

47
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:50,720
we're going to be focusing here right

48
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:54,159
well what has been done on dns right dns

49
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:56,640
with this a lot of security in dns we

50
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,640
have the dns sec

51
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:02,399
which is dated back 2005 and actually

52
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:06,240
is quite complex to implement

53
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:09,440
based on route signing key management

54
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,479
validation

55
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:13,520
uh it's a bit complex and

56
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:16,000
it doesn't really provide a privacy it's

57
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:16,800
just mainly

58
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,840
validation so for tampering domains or

59
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,120
authenticate domains

60
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:24,160
and answers basically then we have dns

61
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:24,560
over

62
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:27,760
https daw actually called

63
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:30,080
the idea was to encrypt the client

64
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,160
traffic so the ap cannot track but

65
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,959
i still are able to track you anyways

66
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:35,920
and it

67
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:38,879
also used to bypass uh enterprise

68
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:40,319
filters and companies and

69
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:44,160
also help criminals you know to

70
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,560
keep some stuff on it and then we have a

71
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,120
dns over tls right tina's

72
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,440
tls of course is tcp traffic so

73
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:52,959
performance is

74
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:57,280
is a bit different than the udp so we

75
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,360
lose performance so there's a lot of

76
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,879
caching going on

77
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:04,560
than udp right and also we got something

78
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,840
called opportunistic

79
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:08,159
which is basically a way that to fail

80
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:09,760
back from a

81
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:12,879
dns or tls into plain dns so

82
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:15,920
that's another thing to explore so this

83
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:18,560
is a classic estimate use of a dns why

84
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,200
you have a

85
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,920
big chunk of dns query legitimate or not

86
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,840
but dns query traffic and then you got

87
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,360
some tunneling traffic

88
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,599
and a small portion of a command control

89
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:29,680
and a tiny portion where its data is

90
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:30,560
filtration

91
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:33,599
that's what we're going to focus here

92
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:36,319
cover channels oh core channels apply to

93
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:37,680
many different protocols

94
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:40,560
or we are going to specifically talk

95
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,640
about dns code channels right

96
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:45,840
so we split it in three main categories

97
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,120
which is tunneling

98
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:50,239
tunneling used mainly for let's say

99
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:52,799
you have free internet access in uh

100
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:53,920
airplanes or

101
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:56,400
hotels where you have a captain portal

102
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,159
but dns traffic is allowed so you can

103
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:00,480
encapsulate your traffic out via dns so

104
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:03,120
bring up a vpn open vpn on port 53

105
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:07,360
and just do a vpn like that or bypass

106
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,400
corporate powers as well right tunneling

107
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,959
command and control is used a lot in

108
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:14,319
botanists and

109
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:18,720
malware updates we see an apt

110
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,279
being used a lot reversal espionage

111
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:22,960
response state actors

112
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:25,600
command controller is quite widely used

113
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,560
as well

114
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,160
and then they have the entire filtration

115
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,400
which is data leaks

116
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:33,600
theft or actually

117
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,440
unauthorized transfer from an employee

118
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,520
outside the company

119
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,759
so we will try to focus on the data

120
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:41,120
exfiltration part

121
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:44,400
with different techniques right so what

122
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,240
kind of tools we have out there

123
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:49,120
so these are all open source tools like

124
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,800
most of it from github right so i

125
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,560
divided in two categories

126
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,560
one is for the dns exploration and one

127
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:57,360
for the tunneling slash quantum control

128
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,440
uh for example on the just the name if

129
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:00,639
you know in the dns

130
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:03,680
filtration side there's a pi x fill

131
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,919
which is a framework actually which has

132
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:08,000
been used to test from a rating point of

133
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,280
view to test out

134
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,600
what kind of a filtration is i can

135
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,880
bypass or use

136
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,880
and of course includes dns as well and

137
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,080
many more

138
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,840
and then on the tunneling inside or

139
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,520
command and control we have for example

140
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:20,320
iodine

141
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:23,479
or dns cut too just to mention

142
00:05:23,479 --> 00:05:26,639
iodine for for example a palo alto

143
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:28,479
folder has a specific signature to

144
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:30,479
detect iodine traffic

145
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:33,199
and there is also a tool called mystica

146
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:34,880
which was present in black

147
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:38,800
us arsenal this pass august

148
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,560
which looked quite promising actually

149
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,160
using soap and a few different

150
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,600
techniques

151
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,000
so this is what we have currently right

152
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,360
so

153
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,880
don't know how to start so what we're

154
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,880
doing is we put a pros and con lists of

155
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:53,199
what we don't want based on research of

156
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:55,440
how security tools work right

157
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:58,080
and what we wish what we would like to

158
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:58,800
have right

159
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:03,520
so again let me just name a few

160
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:08,319
short ttls short tls are

161
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:11,680
normally used like for a f5 gtms to load

162
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,680
balance between data centers or

163
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,240
resilience between regions so they will

164
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,160
use a short etl so the cache

165
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:21,199
on the app thick domains will be

166
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:23,199
not that big because they will be

167
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:25,360
changing ip for balancing

168
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:28,960
with the resilience right txt and

169
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:31,280
null is just a red flag right no type of

170
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:32,080
quality

171
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:35,840
dns queries are actually yeah red flag

172
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:39,039
immediately and txt are mainly used in

173
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:40,319
terminal for ad

174
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:42,720
traffic for example microsoft a active

175
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,880
directory is a lot of dxt when you join

176
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,240
domains

177
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:49,759
and spf records as well use txt

178
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:52,000
so then what else we don't want we don't

179
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,440
want a long

180
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:57,120
fqdn it's 250

181
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,199
characters that you can fit in fqdn

182
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:01,199
called split back levels which

183
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:03,840
each label is 63 octets which is

184
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,360
basically characters right

185
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,840
so we don't want that too long we also

186
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:08,479
don't want

187
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:10,080
a massive amount of queries from the

188
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,400
same ip address that looks suspicious as

189
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,000
well in analytics

190
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,720
and tomo thomas maximum amount of nx

191
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,639
domains which is basically when

192
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:20,800
you try to resolve something and the dns

193
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,080
will reply now that

194
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,240
doesn't exist right which is slightly

195
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,639
different than timeout right

196
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:30,000
and a same domain you know evil.com

197
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,280
you say one million queries to evil.com

198
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:33,840
from a

199
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:36,319
from one ip that will be automatically

200
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:38,319
flagged as suspicious for the volume of

201
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:39,599
traffic and the

202
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:43,520
source ips use the destination domains

203
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,840
now great we don't want that so what we

204
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:46,720
want

205
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,319
we want to split the architecture in

206
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:51,280
data and control and data

207
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:53,759
we also want to use ns type of query

208
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:54,800
which is

209
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:58,240
it's recursive and you know is commonly

210
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:58,960
used

211
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:01,199
we want short levels 20 30 characters

212
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:02,879
max you know more than that we want to

213
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:03,280
use

214
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,840
many ip addresses as a source we don't

215
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:06,639
want to use

216
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:09,919
just one and we we want no answer coming

217
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:10,240
back

218
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:13,039
from our queries i'm going to use

219
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:15,039
multiple domains originals i don't know

220
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:15,440
5

221
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:18,240
5 10 100 different domains that the

222
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,000
subdomains that we want to use

223
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,000
this is all what we want right

224
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:27,280
how the tool will work i'm going to show

225
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:27,919
you is

226
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:31,520
uh from the client point of view

227
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:34,559
you want to exfiltrate data to a server

228
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:35,679
in the internet right

229
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:37,120
but you don't have access directly to

230
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,200
the internet so what we're going to use

231
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,880
here is we're going to use the internal

232
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,320
line as the pivot

233
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:45,360
so the client internal in the network

234
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,120
and the network internally and will send

235
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:49,839
queries to the dns in terminal like a

236
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:51,600
microsoft id or whatever you have

237
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,760
and then the dns internal will actually

238
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,440
be the one sending the traffic so

239
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,720
bear in mind this is the way that we

240
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,560
want to send traffic we're not

241
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,800
going to send from client to server

242
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:03,599
traffic directly

243
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,920
so we mentioned about control and data

244
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:06,959
splitting right

245
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:09,040
so we want to be able to support

246
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,560
threading or multitasking to send

247
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,320
multiple files at the same time if we're

248
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,839
going to actually trade files from

249
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:15,519
client internal to the internet we want

250
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:18,000
to be scalable there are many domains

251
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,240
and we want asymmetrics flows symmetric

252
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,440
flow is basically

253
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,200
the way that we use the control and data

254
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,680
remember like adsense you have a half

255
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,040
meg or one meg

256
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:29,680
upload and 24 megs download this is

257
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:30,560
designed because

258
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:34,080
it's your http is small request small

259
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,240
and your the answer from the server back

260
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,760
to you is big right with the all

261
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:38,800
javascript

262
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:42,399
graphics image csc et cetera right

263
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:44,000
this is the same concept we just want

264
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,600
the control traffic to tell the client

265
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,959
internally to the external

266
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:49,040
server i'm going to send you this file

267
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:51,200
this big this is the name

268
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,839
and then we want to send in the whole

269
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:54,480
file

270
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,880
in multiple queries from the using the

271
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,480
data domains right

272
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,560
we also not don't want to do the

273
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:01,680
sequential like

274
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,920
sending chunk of data one two three four

275
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:05,760
because that also gets flagged

276
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,600
i'm going to compress the data and we

277
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,440
want to encrypt it with a

278
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:12,720
reliable hard encryption like as256 ctr

279
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:13,839
right

280
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:16,240
and one more we want to add capability

281
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,040
for

282
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:19,200
retransmission because edp packet get

283
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,360
lost sometimes right

284
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:24,880
and we want that capabilities

285
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,800
what else we want or funny things right

286
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:29,120
we also want to be

287
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:31,200
silenced we want to blend in just in the

288
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,600
network no i see us we are just

289
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:37,040
normal queries right so we will use ns

290
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:37,360
type

291
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,279
query which is common to get the domain

292
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:40,399
resolves

293
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:42,320
we also don't want any answer from the

294
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:43,760
server in the internet back to us

295
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:44,880
because we want

296
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,399
we don't want any stateful connections

297
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:48,560
on the vowels right that will be or

298
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:51,920
the ips so as they will be actually in

299
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,440
the foul after 30 seconds that

300
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,800
nothing come back the foul will

301
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,000
eliminate the connection from the

302
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:56,640
stateful

303
00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:00,160
tables and put it as h out in the logs

304
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:03,279
we want to put the random

305
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:05,680
times between queries that is to add

306
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,200
entropy

307
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:10,079
we want to limit the 23 characters and a

308
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:10,880
spoofing

309
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:13,440
remember i mentioned we we want to have

310
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,240
a

311
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,640
not one ip right so because we are able

312
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:19,519
to be in internal network and udp is

313
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:22,560
very nice when the time is spoofing

314
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,560
so we want to send traffic from the

315
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:25,600
internal server

316
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:28,959
to the internal dns from many source api

317
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:30,000
it's not just ours

318
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,240
right and internal servers don't tend to

319
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,440
have a foul

320
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,120
micro segmentation is not that common

321
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,959
these days and uh

322
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:39,279
so that allow us to actually do a

323
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:40,320
spoofing right

324
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:43,600
internal network and uh yeah

325
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:46,959
everything needs to be random right so

326
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:50,320
that's all we want we can do all this

327
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:53,519
i'm possible i'm positive actually

328
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:57,040
we can do all this so

329
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:00,639
let's have a proof of life right

330
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:03,040
so the effect defects actually is dns

331
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,959
file filtration is a tool like

332
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:07,839
in github you can go and take a look and

333
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:09,600
i'm going to show you how it works

334
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,399
so i'm going to do a quick demo of it so

335
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:14,079
you can see let me switch

336
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:17,120
to the actual terminals all right

337
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:20,399
so on the right side i have a the

338
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:23,040
dna defects server which is actually a

339
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,639
love environment sitting on the back

340
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:26,639
that i actually built

341
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:30,079
uh this could be amazon azure bps

342
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:33,040
or digitalocean anything that is in the

343
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:33,839
internet

344
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:36,240
and i also have a bunch of domain

345
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,240
subdomains that i can control and put

346
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:38,800
the

347
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,920
ns record pointing to my server public

348
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:43,279
id

349
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:45,760
on the left side i have the client the

350
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,600
client is sitting inside the network and

351
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,079
he

352
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:49,600
doesn't have access to the internet

353
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,200
internet directly so the only way that

354
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,000
he can resolve

355
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,560
things is through the internal dns and

356
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:56,000
on the bottom i have a

357
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,399
internal dns actually which i'm going to

358
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:00,320
bring up the tcp ram to see what he see

359
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,120
from the client

360
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:04,240
right point of view so let's go and

361
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,000
start the server

362
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,800
with i'll put the verbose you can see

363
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,560
you specify an interface

364
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:13,519
the app before i show you the data i

365
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:14,880
have a

366
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:18,000
i have five domains right as my data

367
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,279
domains

368
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:22,480
and one i could have more if i want to

369
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:25,440
control domain right so i have so i'm

370
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,200
going to specify the server to be

371
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,040
verbose the interface i'm going to

372
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,040
specify the data domains which is a list

373
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,880
of domains could you use one if you want

374
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:33,440
to but

375
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:36,800
as much as as many use better and also

376
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,560
specify the control domain which is

377
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:41,040
in this case it's just one and i'm going

378
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:43,360
to run my server in the internet right

379
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:46,720
okay perfect is listening so at the same

380
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,320
time i'm going to bring the

381
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,320
tcp dump to capture the packets on the

382
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:53,040
dns or in the internal dna server

383
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,360
and i'm going to bring the client

384
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:57,440
verbose specify an interface

385
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:00,000
you can specify the networks and how big

386
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,360
you want that network

387
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:04,720
24 21 18 whatever to this is designed

388
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:05,600
for spoofing

389
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,040
if you don't specify we'll take the

390
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:09,279
default from the actual interface

391
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:12,000
uh you need to specialize the the data

392
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:12,880
and the control

393
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,800
which is exactly the same list that has

394
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,160
the other one the server and the client

395
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:17,279
should have the same list

396
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:19,600
the domain and control and also you need

397
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:20,560
to specify this

398
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:23,600
the file you want to exfiltrate right so

399
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,480
let's say

400
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,160
you can put a directory as well with

401
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:27,760
bunch of files

402
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:31,120
so let's run this so

403
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,760
what it's going to do is going to assign

404
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:34,320
a

405
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:37,760
file id randomly ff and this is the

406
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:40,320
network i'm going to use and i have 254

407
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:43,680
ipr available to spoof and on the bottom

408
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:46,320
and there's 448 this is a checksum and

409
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,639
the of the file and there's 448 chunks

410
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:50,079
that i'm going to send right

411
00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:52,560
and on the bottom you can see random ips

412
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,160
sending to the internal dns

413
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,000
random queries from multiple domains

414
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,120
from random names right

415
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:02,399
so what

416
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:05,040
in one of these queries at the beginning

417
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:05,839
you actually

418
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:08,399
will see the control query right which

419
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:11,120
was from my ip

420
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:14,639
to the actual uh public one

421
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:17,920
from iop to internal so that's the one

422
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:19,519
telling me this is the file name which

423
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:19,920
is called

424
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:22,880
secret dv and this is a this is a crc

425
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:25,199
checksum right it's going to compare

426
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:27,199
all right so the server noticed there's

427
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:28,240
two files two

428
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:30,399
chunks missing so he's going to ask for

429
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:32,480
re-transmission in this case right

430
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,959
so how the transmission works the

431
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:37,040
transmission work in a way that

432
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:41,279
i'm going to after i finish sending the

433
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:41,839
chunks

434
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:44,560
i'm going to ask the server if you need

435
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:45,759
any packet that you

436
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:47,600
don't have any chunks you're missing so

437
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,199
the server will reply to me

438
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:50,880
in this case it's the only case that the

439
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,720
actual server will reply

440
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,800
asking like yep i'm missing the chunk

441
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:57,040
330 on the 24.

442
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:00,320
so it's going to say i missed it 24

443
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:03,360
so he will resend back the 24

444
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:05,040
then the client will ask again are you

445
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:06,480
missing any chunks

446
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:07,759
and he said yeah actually i'm missing

447
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:09,759
another one that's 3 30.

448
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:12,000
so the client will send the 3 30 and

449
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:12,959
then the client will say

450
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:15,920
are you missing any files any chunks and

451
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,120
if there's no answer

452
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:19,519
after x amount of time the client will

453
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:20,720
assume that

454
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:23,440
you get all of it on the server side you

455
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,440
can see that i received a

456
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,519
file name called secret dv when this is

457
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:28,800
the crt

458
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:32,160
crc 32 checksum which should match the

459
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,320
actual so let's do an md5 some

460
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:37,199
of the secret on the client and it's

461
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:38,079
finishing

462
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:42,560
seven by b1 let me kill the server

463
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:47,440
and do an md5 checksum of secret

464
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:50,800
yep i have the file and it's the same md

465
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:51,680
file

466
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:54,720
right so effectively speaking in that

467
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:55,199
way

468
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:57,600
you can see the traffic if i maybe if

469
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,199
scroll

470
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:01,440
you can see in this site you can see all

471
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,360
the ip address

472
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:06,160
random this is using the spoofing in

473
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:08,160
this way if you do a statistics you will

474
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,439
notice that the

475
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:12,640
to this sub domain this ip makes three

476
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:14,559
or four queries two queries right

477
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:16,640
oh so it doesn't look suspicious

478
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,000
suspiciously

479
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,559
one ip if like 254 ips make two queries

480
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:24,319
it's not the same that the one ip doing

481
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:25,839
448 queries

482
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:29,280
right to the same domain doing this way

483
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:32,799
we can i i put five but imagine you have

484
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:35,840
100 right so

485
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:38,320
you will have probably some ips doing

486
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:39,600
only one query

487
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:42,880
to the internal dns right and there's no

488
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,640
traffic coming back

489
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:47,440
so there's no actually response from any

490
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,640
of those queries

491
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,000
so you just will time out on the

492
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,080
followers right

493
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:54,160
so let me switch back to the

494
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:56,640
presentation

495
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:00,080
all right prevention and detection

496
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:03,280
okay how to prevent this right well it's

497
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:05,760
quite straightforward right we just

498
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:06,880
don't allow dns

499
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:09,039
external queries to work from internal

500
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:11,919
networks that's great easy easy fix

501
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:15,039
the only condition is that uh doing this

502
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:16,799
we probably break half of the company

503
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:17,840
and if we have a

504
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:20,320
hybrid clouds will be a very painful

505
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:20,960
thing to make it

506
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:23,360
work due to the nature of the cloud

507
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:24,400
actually needing

508
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:27,600
dns resolution external dns for solution

509
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:30,960
so that's a tricky fix can be done but

510
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,960
it's tricky

511
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,559
we can also push everything through

512
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:37,039
proxy right so effectively speaking

513
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:37,600
there's no

514
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,760
internal dns resolution everything goes

515
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:41,120
through the proxy

516
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,280
is another way to push it again that we

517
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:44,960
may break stuff as well

518
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:48,480
related to cloud we can use dns

519
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,559
sinkholes so all the traffic will go

520
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:52,160
through the sim card to get analyzers

521
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:54,880
instead using directly dns

522
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,400
this could affect performance within the

523
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,320
networks imagine you have a

524
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:00,799
50 000 devices in the networks split all

525
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:02,160
across different regions

526
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,320
so you will need to have multiple sync

527
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:06,559
sinkholes deploys and so

528
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:09,200
it is technically possible but it's a

529
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:11,200
bit complex as well

530
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,559
and then you correlate all the logs of

531
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:14,480
course analytics yes

532
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:16,720
that's one of the best things you can do

533
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:17,600
using

534
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:21,120
electric search splunks just have a

535
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:23,840
correlation you need basically all your

536
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:25,679
dns servers internal dns server should

537
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:27,200
be logging everything right

538
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,200
any kind of query from where what type

539
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,720
of query

540
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:31,840
and then you need to use all the

541
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:35,120
analytics you can to actually try to

542
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:38,799
find out patterns and trends

543
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:41,760
and things like that and all those

544
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:43,679
systems works but what you really need

545
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:46,480
actually is very smart people that's all

546
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:47,840
you need right

547
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:50,320
looking into the analytics entropy

548
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:53,600
analysis entropy analysis also work

549
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:56,320
again is you need it's based on the logs

550
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,240
and you will try to find an entropy

551
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:00,000
it could be tricky sometimes due to the

552
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,840
nature of the for example like things

553
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:02,880
club fair

554
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:06,000
which have a similar 2025 random

555
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,600
x type of a dns and they are valid

556
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:10,240
actually

557
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:13,280
see cdn sort of things

558
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:17,678
but yeah you need to maybe do a more

559
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:20,640
analytics on it but again same as small

560
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:21,679
people you have before

561
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:23,280
and hopefully the same one doing the

562
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:25,919
both of the entropy and actually log

563
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:27,039
analysis

564
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:29,760
and also you can switch to cloud

565
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:30,880
services right

566
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:34,159
you can also use a umbrella palo palo

567
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:36,720
alto it has a service as well

568
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:40,000
as well that works at some extent

569
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,480
because not everything if you interface

570
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:43,120
too big

571
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:44,960
you actually cannot really all your

572
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,880
internal traffic go through a

573
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:50,320
club clafia or external dns so

574
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:52,240
you will need to try to split up your

575
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:53,840
internal traffic through

576
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:55,679
internally and do logs analytics and try

577
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:57,760
to split up your external traffic

578
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:00,960
through a third-party provider with the

579
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:04,159
cloud services right so this is kind of

580
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:06,159
the preventions and detection methods

581
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:07,360
that we found

582
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:10,640
so it is technically possible you can

583
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:13,600
have the ips as well there's some

584
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:16,720
analysis and anomalies

585
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:19,600
anomalous anomalous dns which is a weird

586
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:20,400
name but the

587
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:24,080
sick ips for example has a plugin for it

588
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:26,799
uh so they are also provincial for the

589
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:29,840
dha which is the domain generation

590
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:30,559
algorithm

591
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:33,679
which is ramsar rams ram square

592
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:37,520
or rats or malware use a lot you know

593
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:39,679
but yeah it's required a lot of

594
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:42,240
analytics

595
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:47,280
so what's the conclusion here right

596
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:51,120
we ran through the bit of overview of

597
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:53,840
dns itself what kind of attacks we have

598
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:55,760
we did have before in the past

599
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:56,880
how long been there what kind of

600
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,880
security we can implement

601
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:02,240
then we run out so you know techniques

602
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:05,520
and how we do we come up with these

603
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:07,120
techniques of trying to

604
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:09,440
take data from a to b right and trying

605
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:10,720
to not be cut

606
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:13,440
catch on the middle well the first thing

607
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:14,080
you do

608
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:16,400
is to look for the product security

609
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:17,280
products so

610
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:19,039
they're in the market selling you dna

611
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:21,360
security or power security or network

612
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:22,320
securities

613
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:24,960
and you say great how this work okay

614
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,960
this box what it does is look for this

615
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:28,720
pattern matching or these things so

616
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,320
actually look for

617
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:33,600
for long details or look for you know

618
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:34,640
txt records

619
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:36,720
okay great so you put it in a list that

620
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:37,919
you don't want to

621
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:39,520
so you start to work the way around

622
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:42,240
right you see what the security products

623
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:46,240
look for and you actually try not to

624
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:50,640
match those so this is a bit of research

625
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:53,360
test and experiment right so that is the

626
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:54,000
best way to come

627
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,320
up with techniques how to bypass or not

628
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:57,440
be noticed

629
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,320
on these security products right what

630
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:01,360
else we can do

631
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:03,440
remember i mentioned you can have multi

632
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:04,559
scale this right

633
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:07,679
what about you have a 50 control servers

634
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:08,080
right

635
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:10,080
so the actual control server also can be

636
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:12,799
split into multiple different servers

637
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:15,039
at the same time you start a cloud once

638
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:16,559
it will you know

639
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:18,799
bring it up a cloud automation and just

640
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:20,559
start whole deployment

641
00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:22,960
bring it up exfiltrate data bring it

642
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:23,600
down

643
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:26,320
so this could automate could we have

644
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:27,760
multiple agents because

645
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:30,960
file ids have each file you effectrate

646
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:31,760
has an id

647
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:34,240
so it can be have a parallel running

648
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:36,559
threading and all those you know

649
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:38,880
things to speed up file transfer

650
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,320
basically right

651
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:44,000
uh we and how you join all those

652
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
control domains well you can make a gui

653
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,080
and you have all of them sharing that

654
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:49,440
piece of file that each

655
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:51,600
chunk so each each server will get a

656
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:52,799
chunk right

657
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:54,640
and then you have them correlated the

658
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:56,320
file like this and they

659
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:58,240
aggregate it in one place so then you

660
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:00,960
get you can actually

661
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:03,919
decrypt and well reassemble decrypt and

662
00:24:03,919 --> 00:24:05,919
decompress that into an actual file

663
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:07,039
right

664
00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:10,159
uh ideally this is a it was a

665
00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:12,880
test is running on linux but doesn't

666
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:15,200
stop you to actually using

667
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:17,840
powershell for example so if you want to

668
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:20,240
be like

669
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:22,320
in running different platform instead

670
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:24,480
linux you can run it in windows right

671
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:26,400
so there's all sorts of things that you

672
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,159
can go from here

673
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:29,919
the whole idea of this is to give an

674
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:31,600
introduction of these techniques

675
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:35,279
and i would like you to start to think

676
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:38,080
how you can take these techniques modify

677
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:38,799
adapt

678
00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:41,440
and implement in a different way so

679
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:43,360
maybe you have a better idea to use some

680
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:45,039
techniques in a different way

681
00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:47,120
so that's the whole idea of this is just

682
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:48,720
give you an introduction of the

683
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:51,760
research text experiment right see so

684
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:55,600

685
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:57,440

give some comments so the i put the the

691
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:07,600
actually

692
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:10,159

raise prs if you if you spot something

696
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:22,480
it's you know it's made in python 3 it

697
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:24,080
has some libraries

698
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:27,440
i'm not a native programmer so

699
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:29,600
it's done with love so it can be

700
