1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:06,770
so my name is Hong Kong I come from

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:09,300
Alabama group as a security researcher

3
00:00:06,770 --> 00:00:13,530
today is great honor to be on stage to

4
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:16,980
share some of my my thoughts and my

5
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:20,820
ideas during my research work my

6
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:25,980
research focusing on IOT b2x and several

7
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:28,859
physics systems so I want to share some

8
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:32,159
of the effective approaches from the

9
00:00:28,859 --> 00:00:36,090
open source communities so that we can

10
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:38,968
build up some interesting in fact you

11
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:42,780
productive communities in our cyber

12
00:00:38,969 --> 00:00:46,559
physics cyber security community so

13
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:50,550
basically what I think a researcher

14
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:53,789
should be a sniper as well as a as an

15
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:56,849
observer because if you look so hard on

16
00:00:53,789 --> 00:01:02,670
something you can miss a lot of other

17
00:00:56,850 --> 00:01:05,790
parties but we cannot afford to observe

18
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:07,770
for the whole day so if there is a

19
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:10,350
friendly productive and helpful cyber

20
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:15,210
security community watch your back there

21
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:18,600
will be very good so the core value of

22
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:23,600
community I think according to mr. order

23
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:28,380
from MIT it's productive and helpful so

24
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:30,658
what are our problems now basically we

25
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:35,509
are facing the Internet

26
00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:40,770
of bankruptcy the IOT so we have already

27
00:01:35,509 --> 00:01:47,159
seen the bankruptcy of email right back

28
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:49,649
in the year 20 2004 some some guys are

29
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:52,649
using the technique of bankruptcy of

30
00:01:49,649 --> 00:01:55,350
email that ignoring all of the emails

31
00:01:52,649 --> 00:01:59,460
later on and just to send every other

32
00:01:55,350 --> 00:02:03,419
email that I am bankrupted please send

33
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:06,119
me another email if you rather need and

34
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:08,640
furthermore we are facing the bankruptcy

35
00:02:06,119 --> 00:02:11,640
of instant messages and we cannot

36
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:14,339
handling so much of messages now

37
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:16,859
and we are facing the bankruptcy of

38
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:20,790
ready never remember the last time you

39
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:23,760
want to save an article for later use

40
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:27,630
and you never read it actually and the

41
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:30,209
bankruptcy of news even RSS the worst

42
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:33,390
part of it is bankruptcy of focus we

43
00:02:30,209 --> 00:02:37,709
cannot focus on nothing for longer than

44
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:40,049
eight or nine seconds it's basically the

45
00:02:37,709 --> 00:02:42,750
intelligence or sublime because our

46
00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:46,370
human beings cannot handle so much of

47
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:51,209
information during the past decades and

48
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:54,690
I am failed and will fail again because

49
00:02:51,209 --> 00:02:56,760
we need to be forever online and there

50
00:02:54,690 --> 00:02:59,100
are a lot of distractions and push

51
00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:02,459
notifications and there are a lots of

52
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:05,070
clients with proprietary protocols and

53
00:03:02,459 --> 00:03:09,030
even versus they are flooding stickers

54
00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:11,640
and flatterers that there is no serious

55
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:15,150
and helpful discussions and even worse

56
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:18,238
days centralized system all of your data

57
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:21,829
is stored on the I am servers and not

58
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:23,910
ready no mark Ives according to the

59
00:03:21,829 --> 00:03:25,950
communication technology is Nyquist

60
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:29,910
theorem if you want to get the whole

61
00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:34,320
picture or an accurate something of a

62
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:36,269
signal you have to separate at least

63
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:40,400
should be double of the signal rate

64
00:03:36,269 --> 00:03:44,010
right as for our information handling it

65
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:47,310
can be learned that if we want to get

66
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:51,480
the whole picture of the research area

67
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:54,420
you need to be read as much of the

68
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:58,200
information as you can and as fast as

69
00:03:54,420 --> 00:04:01,140
you can and there's another interesting

70
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:04,560
thing that there are more and more

71
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:07,738
popular high catalyzer that can filter

72
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:10,410
messages for you but in my opinion we

73
00:04:07,739 --> 00:04:13,019
should not trust it we should not trust

74
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:17,279
a I characterize err because take this

75
00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:21,690
picture if the vertical axis is good

76
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:25,188
news and the this is a bad news and the

77
00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:28,500
AI categorize our will

78
00:04:25,189 --> 00:04:32,639
definitely reported the good news for

79
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:35,669
you so you just think I am the best keep

80
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:40,020
on and ignore the chance of improvement

81
00:04:35,669 --> 00:04:42,389
for yourself so this is basically why we

82
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:45,508
shouldn't trust AI categorize in my

83
00:04:42,389 --> 00:04:49,050
opinion and according to Dan bars number

84
00:04:45,509 --> 00:04:52,949
which is a very simple theory that a

85
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:58,190
human being can and only maintain an

86
00:04:52,949 --> 00:05:00,930
active connections with at most 148

87
00:04:58,190 --> 00:05:06,169
human beings at the same time so

88
00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:10,469
basically 140 148 raised to the power of

89
00:05:06,169 --> 00:05:13,979
4.55 is roughly the whole population of

90
00:05:10,469 --> 00:05:18,000
the globe so basically this is that is

91
00:05:13,979 --> 00:05:21,060
why there are a lot of hierarchy of

92
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:23,449
reporting by level but you know the

93
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:27,229
reporting by level model has some

94
00:05:23,449 --> 00:05:30,779
serious disturb on DJ's because the is

95
00:05:27,229 --> 00:05:34,710
information asymmetry which is a source

96
00:05:30,779 --> 00:05:37,440
of the power right and furthermore there

97
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:41,008
are a lot of distractions and we are

98
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:43,680
facing we are in último ultimate war

99
00:05:41,009 --> 00:05:47,520
between our users and product managers

100
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:51,539
and remember we have the keyboards a

101
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:54,029
hundred years ago the typewriter the qwt

102
00:05:51,539 --> 00:05:57,449
buckyballs right and now we are losing

103
00:05:54,029 --> 00:06:01,400
its way now are having touchscreens we

104
00:05:57,449 --> 00:06:04,289
have once we had very very fancy very

105
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:10,560
useful shortcuts but now that give us

106
00:06:04,289 --> 00:06:13,949
gestures and we lose HTML that everyone

107
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:17,190
can easily deploy an application but now

108
00:06:13,949 --> 00:06:18,779
we have application store and sing I

109
00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:20,909
think a male and now we have push

110
00:06:18,779 --> 00:06:23,879
notification and we have to be online

111
00:06:20,909 --> 00:06:25,740
for error and we lose some serious news

112
00:06:23,879 --> 00:06:29,159
and productive discussion and they give

113
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:33,930
us stickers right the sum up stickers

114
00:06:29,159 --> 00:06:36,630
and cats so they are basically now are

115
00:06:33,930 --> 00:06:40,380
the products

116
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:43,830
I call according to Time magazine we now

117
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:46,349
have a shorter actually I I know have a

118
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:48,810
shorter attention span than goldfish

119
00:06:46,349 --> 00:06:52,110
the goldfish has nine seconds of memory

120
00:06:48,810 --> 00:06:55,229
and internet-connected human beings only

121
00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:58,919
have eight seconds so this is our

122
00:06:55,229 --> 00:07:01,490
problem and this is a very interesting

123
00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:05,460
research that one one guy use a

124
00:07:01,490 --> 00:07:10,169
high-speed camera to record your typing

125
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:16,430
and your characters on screen so they

126
00:07:10,169 --> 00:07:21,409
mirror the input lag you can see this

127
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:27,330
some modern computers are not responsive

128
00:07:21,410 --> 00:07:32,280
than the sentir are old ones and so

129
00:07:27,330 --> 00:07:36,180
according to Andy and Bill's law we our

130
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:39,929
pro users experience are not improved

131
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:42,030
for the past decades we are still asleep

132
00:07:39,930 --> 00:07:44,669
still waiting for the machines install

133
00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:51,630
itself instead of the machines waiting

134
00:07:44,669 --> 00:07:54,030
for ours serving us so this is basically

135
00:07:51,630 --> 00:07:57,780
the summary of the challenges we are

136
00:07:54,030 --> 00:08:00,448
facing okay eight minutes nice

137
00:07:57,780 --> 00:08:04,739
so before we want to share the further

138
00:08:00,449 --> 00:08:07,979
ideas I want to give us the conclusions

139
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:12,030
first so you can take this in mind and

140
00:08:07,979 --> 00:08:16,199
see the following stories basically I

141
00:08:12,030 --> 00:08:19,289
want to categorize our members into

142
00:08:16,199 --> 00:08:22,050
senior members regular members new

143
00:08:19,289 --> 00:08:24,750
members public and random members and

144
00:08:22,050 --> 00:08:27,539
they have a lot of different behaviors

145
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:29,639
and they have different user agents and

146
00:08:27,539 --> 00:08:33,240
all of them should be respective

147
00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:37,700
accordingly and we have to use trusted

148
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:41,579
calculator and some board to bridge the

149
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:44,459
clients together and I have a three

150
00:08:41,578 --> 00:08:45,449
parts of each basically the first is and

151
00:08:44,459 --> 00:08:48,479
leave no one behind

152
00:08:45,449 --> 00:08:51,029
bridge everything and keep everyone

153
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:54,690
raise everything and to achieve this we

154
00:08:51,029 --> 00:08:58,860
need to build something very fast and we

155
00:08:54,690 --> 00:09:01,589
wait for everyone no need to no need for

156
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:04,260
them to show up for every every time and

157
00:09:01,589 --> 00:09:07,529
we have to build a helpful and

158
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:10,370
productive community and we have to rule

159
00:09:07,529 --> 00:09:16,050
out some toxic behavior I met by

160
00:09:10,370 --> 00:09:19,529
speaking of toxic I mean these once

161
00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:20,219
these behavior appears it will never

162
00:09:19,529 --> 00:09:27,180
come back

163
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:30,000
so let's first we want to learn from

164
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:32,790
some of the big names they are facing

165
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:36,209
the same but the bigger problems and we

166
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:39,029
want to see their solutions so

167
00:09:36,209 --> 00:09:44,239
Lanie's aligners oh sorry I should

168
00:09:39,029 --> 00:09:46,860
pronounce the edge leanest or walls

169
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:50,790
he is a founder of he's a father of

170
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:53,069
Linux right he said only wimps use take

171
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:55,079
a backup realm and just upload their

172
00:09:53,069 --> 00:09:58,229
important stuff on FTP and let the rest

173
00:09:55,079 --> 00:10:02,729
of the world mirror it and the other

174
00:09:58,230 --> 00:10:04,860
part of his coat is he he raised he

175
00:10:02,730 --> 00:10:08,610
talked to organize his emails it just

176
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:11,880
keep everything in one big folder and I

177
00:10:08,610 --> 00:10:15,389
have done some research of his emails in

178
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:19,139
Linux kernel my mailing list and I found

179
00:10:15,389 --> 00:10:24,149
that about half of their emails for the

180
00:10:19,139 --> 00:10:27,240
past of 20 years they are written with

181
00:10:24,149 --> 00:10:32,389
pine or Alpine the modern version of

182
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:35,850
pine according to the hacker ethics

183
00:10:32,389 --> 00:10:39,360
written by Chaos Computer Club

184
00:10:35,850 --> 00:10:43,040
there is a code says make public data

185
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:49,130
available and protect private data and

186
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:52,920
this one is the email from the birth of

187
00:10:49,130 --> 00:10:58,740
Linux trolls the Linux kernel you can

188
00:10:52,920 --> 00:11:00,339
see this the date is 90 91 and the

189
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:04,070
publish

190
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:09,040
places newsgroup comp dot org dot MINIX

191
00:11:04,070 --> 00:11:14,530
and this one is the modern the the year

192
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:18,230
2006 he was discussing his email clients

193
00:11:14,530 --> 00:11:20,750
you can see these from the year 2007 and

194
00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:24,890
he is using alpine it's murder immersion

195
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:26,930
blah blah blah and learn expose is a

196
00:11:24,890 --> 00:11:31,939
facing the categorize of failure in the

197
00:11:26,930 --> 00:11:36,560
year of 2015 that are around the 20% of

198
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:38,990
the emails is filtered as a spam so he's

199
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:40,900
very angry about this because there are

200
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:44,600
a lot of useful pages a lot of

201
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:49,069
interesting discussions cannot be marked

202
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:54,980
as spam so rudely Marissa Mayer she's

203
00:11:49,070 --> 00:12:00,710
the former CEO of Yahoo I remember she

204
00:11:54,980 --> 00:12:03,980
said who he/she kept as many as 700 to

205
00:12:00,710 --> 00:12:07,210
800 dame of emails and he/she needs

206
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:11,090
something very fast so she use a

207
00:12:07,210 --> 00:12:14,390
application called pion and to marathon

208
00:12:11,090 --> 00:12:20,420
email catch-up sessions up to 14 hours

209
00:12:14,390 --> 00:12:25,670
ever wake early at saturday or sunday so

210
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:27,979
what is pi mine is a very old-school but

211
00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:31,670
very effective email client according to

212
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:35,630
my opinion back in the year of 1989 and

213
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:38,319
the pine was the de facto email client

214
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:42,470
according to this guy from hacker news

215
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:44,720
for many universities and the pine is

216
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:49,250
short for program for internet news and

217
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:52,850
email and remember you if you once used

218
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:55,160
the nano the best editor ever none of

219
00:12:52,850 --> 00:12:58,130
new now no it's basically evolved from

220
00:12:55,160 --> 00:13:03,260
the pico pico is the beauty editor of

221
00:12:58,130 --> 00:13:06,350
pine and this picture is from slack dot

222
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:09,650
stanford.edu slack is short for Stanford

223
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:12,930
Linear Accelerator Center is for for the

224
00:13:09,650 --> 00:13:16,980
physicists so a lot of the

225
00:13:12,930 --> 00:13:21,329
servers provide alpine and of for the

226
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:28,439
CERN the MIT they also provide a pine or

227
00:13:21,329 --> 00:13:34,769
Alpine Greg KH he's one of the active

228
00:13:28,439 --> 00:13:38,550
maintainer of Linux kernel during a he

229
00:13:34,769 --> 00:13:41,189
once said he trying to swear off of IRC

230
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:45,479
because he thought he's a great

231
00:13:41,189 --> 00:13:49,248
distraction so this is gkh and our hero

232
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:53,970
Richard Mathias torment of a new moment

233
00:13:49,249 --> 00:13:58,019
he's read web page said I'm he's

234
00:13:53,970 --> 00:14:00,929
abandoning cellular phones and the way

235
00:13:58,019 --> 00:14:04,170
he's using Internet is quite interesting

236
00:14:00,929 --> 00:14:08,689
because he he want to read some web page

237
00:14:04,170 --> 00:14:12,360
it just to send an URL link to the

238
00:14:08,689 --> 00:14:15,360
server and the server will fetch it and

239
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:18,449
send it back by email to him who quite

240
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:22,800
old school ha and Lambie the former

241
00:14:18,449 --> 00:14:26,128
former leader of TBN project and he even

242
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:30,179
used email as a cat things Chan style of

243
00:14:26,129 --> 00:14:34,259
to the list what he's using is he wrote

244
00:14:30,179 --> 00:14:37,980
sup some stripes scripts that if you

245
00:14:34,259 --> 00:14:40,800
want to put this email and show up after

246
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:45,059
some days of for example week how awake

247
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:47,128
after you can just put this email to a

248
00:14:45,059 --> 00:14:51,990
folder named delight thought seven days

249
00:14:47,129 --> 00:14:54,749
and the script will rotate by each day

250
00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:57,569
and after seven days the email will show

251
00:14:54,749 --> 00:15:00,860
up against and you will you will have a

252
00:14:57,569 --> 00:15:05,990
more mature thoughts on it maybe and

253
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:10,139
guido van rossum he's the father of

254
00:15:05,990 --> 00:15:14,970
Python program and he said I read

255
00:15:10,139 --> 00:15:17,629
everything sent to his mailbox so he

256
00:15:14,970 --> 00:15:21,749
just reads everything so it's very

257
00:15:17,629 --> 00:15:24,980
interesting and Donald Knuth the author

258
00:15:21,749 --> 00:15:29,329
of tag right and he

259
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:32,629
a professor of MIT and she is the author

260
00:15:29,329 --> 00:15:37,339
of the book ti LCP the art of computer

261
00:15:32,629 --> 00:15:40,639
programming and he has been a happy man

262
00:15:37,339 --> 00:15:46,819
ever since 1990 because he no longer

263
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:49,339
with emails he has a very good circuit

264
00:15:46,819 --> 00:15:51,620
or a wonderful secretary and filter

265
00:15:49,339 --> 00:15:56,600
every incoming emails and print the

266
00:15:51,620 --> 00:16:00,980
important stuff for him to read so this

267
00:15:56,600 --> 00:16:04,009
is basically our heroes I'd like to show

268
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:05,770
a brief demonstration of the good old

269
00:16:04,009 --> 00:16:09,130
days

270
00:16:05,770 --> 00:16:09,130
[Music]

271
00:16:11,529 --> 00:16:21,529
so this okay let me show from the start

272
00:16:15,790 --> 00:16:25,009
so this is a server a public access poll

273
00:16:21,529 --> 00:16:32,839
UNIX server called SDF dot org and I

274
00:16:25,009 --> 00:16:41,509
will log into it yes and we have Alpine

275
00:16:32,839 --> 00:16:43,339
sorry there is a lot of mmm this is some

276
00:16:41,509 --> 00:16:46,699
sort of like the BBS style of the

277
00:16:43,339 --> 00:16:49,189
message handling for example this one is

278
00:16:46,699 --> 00:16:53,199
the N NTP server provided by Linux

279
00:16:49,189 --> 00:16:56,240
kernel code or you can read all of the

280
00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:59,990
emails discussions without subscribing

281
00:16:56,240 --> 00:17:03,079
to the email mailing list and and the

282
00:16:59,990 --> 00:17:06,319
best part of it you can read from the

283
00:17:03,079 --> 00:17:10,188
very beginning of the discussion instead

284
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:13,339
of the losing some before you subscribe

285
00:17:10,189 --> 00:17:18,020
it for example this is a wild card and

286
00:17:13,339 --> 00:17:22,428
this one is if you want to read

287
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:28,668
something from ext4 right so yesterday

288
00:17:22,429 --> 00:17:31,340
is mailing list and imagine if you

289
00:17:28,669 --> 00:17:34,429
subscribe to such a can of the mailing

290
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:35,350
list you are you are definitely will be

291
00:17:34,429 --> 00:17:39,669
bankrupt

292
00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:42,370
of email but I think this is a new the

293
00:17:39,669 --> 00:17:44,830
future of the community because the

294
00:17:42,370 --> 00:17:48,659
amount of buildup something some sort of

295
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:51,189
poll model instead of the push model

296
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:53,620
actually this is the old school way of

297
00:17:51,190 --> 00:17:58,630
messaging handling and security model

298
00:17:53,620 --> 00:18:05,229
right you get a lot of messages and even

299
00:17:58,630 --> 00:18:07,270
like the FGX the padres yesterday and

300
00:18:05,230 --> 00:18:10,570
the next thing I want to show you is

301
00:18:07,270 --> 00:18:16,539
this is a Jemaine which is a bridge

302
00:18:10,570 --> 00:18:20,049
between an NTP and RSS and mailing list

303
00:18:16,539 --> 00:18:23,740
if you want to for example to read

304
00:18:20,049 --> 00:18:27,908
something from DB on there is some nouns

305
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:32,429
from here for example they are they are

306
00:18:27,909 --> 00:18:38,640
selecting the new project leader and

307
00:18:32,429 --> 00:18:38,640
this is after the news / thought oh

308
00:18:40,950 --> 00:18:50,620
three okay and the next thing is the IOA

309
00:18:46,330 --> 00:18:55,449
this is some sort of the Usenet so we're

310
00:18:50,620 --> 00:19:00,459
still serving for example you can find

311
00:18:55,450 --> 00:19:06,240
some discussions oh it's not very active

312
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:12,030
quite and Mozilla Mozilla is still using

313
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:18,150
like yeah and remember this platform

314
00:19:12,030 --> 00:19:26,408
they are discussing the development of

315
00:19:18,150 --> 00:19:31,090
yeah you can just a reply to it you can

316
00:19:26,409 --> 00:19:36,760

319
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:46,490
public accessible I am MP server which

320
00:19:43,419 --> 00:19:48,740
is very useful for example

321
00:19:46,490 --> 00:19:51,770
I have subscribed actually it's not

322
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:54,710

one okay confirm and the best part of

332
00:20:28,550 --> 00:20:36,379
Alpine is you can learn by exploring

333
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:40,219
because all of the help will appears at

334
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:45,640
the bottom bar the other commands you

335
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:49,460
can explore it so and there are some

336
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:54,860
interesting emails during my exploration

337
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:58,640
for example this one is the linux perth

338
00:20:54,860 --> 00:21:06,889
mail yeah this one i can see the headers

339
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:17,150
right form helsinki taught fi and is

340
00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:21,080
saying a lot of ok progress and another

341
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:26,810
interesting thing is tim berners-lee the

342
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:32,510
purse of the first of web browser as he

343
00:21:26,810 --> 00:21:38,570
is published at hypertext and this is

344
00:21:32,510 --> 00:21:43,970
his signature interestingly after 19

345
00:21:38,570 --> 00:21:51,460
days the linux is burst right this is

346
00:21:43,970 --> 00:21:57,399
like 91 and this it is this one

347
00:21:51,460 --> 00:22:02,230
yeah after 19 days Linux is birthed okay

348
00:21:57,399 --> 00:22:05,610
this is basically the demo a brief tour

349
00:22:02,230 --> 00:22:05,610
of the good old days

350
00:22:07,799 --> 00:22:22,840
so where is my pointer so the UM this is

351
00:22:16,690 --> 00:22:27,309
the SDF torg and it's a public server

352
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:27,879
since 1987 and remember it's very

353
00:22:27,309 --> 00:22:31,570
interesting

354
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:35,950
maybe you should register one is free as

355
00:22:31,570 --> 00:22:38,500
long as you have published a email to

356
00:22:35,950 --> 00:22:40,690
the administrators to confirm that you

357
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:45,760
are a human being and you will get it

358
00:22:40,690 --> 00:22:47,980
very interesting and this is some of the

359
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:52,590
discussions although they are not very

360
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:57,070
active but you can still see the some

361
00:22:52,590 --> 00:23:01,209
100 school men are living there and the

362
00:22:57,070 --> 00:23:06,428
next up I want to show what we can learn

363
00:23:01,210 --> 00:23:09,100
from the designs of Internet according

364
00:23:06,429 --> 00:23:13,450
to the first chairman of IETF David's

365
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:14,918
the clerk he said our best success was

366
00:23:13,450 --> 00:23:18,970
not computing but who can people

367
00:23:14,919 --> 00:23:23,740
together David is now a professor of MIT

368
00:23:18,970 --> 00:23:27,730
now the designs of the internet the

369
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:30,520
inventor of it is Vint Cerf he has three

370
00:23:27,730 --> 00:23:32,679
calls that I personally love very much

371
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:36,429
the first one is the Internet is a

372
00:23:32,679 --> 00:23:40,539
reflection of our society if that mirror

373
00:23:36,429 --> 00:23:43,600
has a problem we should not fix a mirror

374
00:23:40,539 --> 00:23:46,629
we have to fix the society and the

375
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:48,850
second one is the more we can organize

376
00:23:46,630 --> 00:23:50,630
and find and manage information the more

377
00:23:48,850 --> 00:23:52,850
effectively we can function in our

378
00:23:50,630 --> 00:23:56,750
mark and this third one is information

379
00:23:52,850 --> 00:23:58,550
sharing is power if you do not share

380
00:23:56,750 --> 00:24:00,530
your ideas smart people cannot do

381
00:23:58,550 --> 00:24:03,710
anything about them and you will remain

382
00:24:00,530 --> 00:24:07,670
anonymous and powerless so this is

383
00:24:03,710 --> 00:24:11,840
basically what the designers of the

384
00:24:07,670 --> 00:24:14,120
internet they are thinking and the

385
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:18,580
internet design principles Tim

386
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:22,040
berners-lee he said he's a father of www

387
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:27,050
decentralization and tolerance and they

388
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:29,750
recruit he published a talk and 1919 to

389
00:24:27,050 --> 00:24:32,000
and after 20 years he delivered the same

390
00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:36,980
token with the same slice and a lot of

391
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:39,830
the citizens he said in that talk is

392
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:40,280
still working after 20 years quite

393
00:24:39,830 --> 00:24:43,070
awesome

394
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:45,740
he said we reject Kings printed

395
00:24:43,070 --> 00:24:47,330
presidents and voting and Bolivian rough

396
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:49,940
concerns an attorney code this is this

397
00:24:47,330 --> 00:24:53,860
is basically the motto of internet

398
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:57,560
Engineering Task Force and speaking of

399
00:24:53,860 --> 00:25:00,620
Internet the underlying protocol

400
00:24:57,560 --> 00:25:03,710
basically is a PGP supporting a border

401
00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:06,889
gateway protocol the Internet is all

402
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:11,240
about the addressing and routing so the

403
00:25:06,890 --> 00:25:14,480
BGP simply advanced advertise network

404
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:17,570
reachability with and for forms neighbor

405
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:20,870
relationships and use metrics to rank

406
00:25:17,570 --> 00:25:24,879
them so what we can learn from the

407
00:25:20,870 --> 00:25:29,540
designs of BGP that each member of the

408
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:33,440
communities he comments with questions

409
00:25:29,540 --> 00:25:35,300
come up with answers and if you were

410
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,630
cast your skills and your needs to each

411
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:37,490
other

412
00:25:35,630 --> 00:25:40,780
and the questions answers in

413
00:25:37,490 --> 00:25:45,050
inspirations will be pasta until you and

414
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:48,830
remember the software Mathematica and

415
00:25:45,050 --> 00:25:52,580
the CEO of it is Stefan boyfriend

416
00:25:48,830 --> 00:25:57,139
recently is publishing a blog post about

417
00:25:52,580 --> 00:25:57,860
his effective approaches during being a

418
00:25:57,140 --> 00:25:59,220
remote

419
00:25:57,860 --> 00:26:02,178
CEO of

420
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:05,039
warfarin company they even built up a

421
00:26:02,179 --> 00:26:08,640
database called who knows what database

422
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:12,600
on each profile picture of the employees

423
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:16,980
that once one finds some problems you

424
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:19,469
can search through the categories the

425
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:20,669
directory of the company and find the

426
00:26:19,470 --> 00:26:26,900
right person to ask

427
00:26:20,669 --> 00:26:30,299
and so imagine this is your you in a

428
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:36,240
community and this is a Dumbo's number

429
00:26:30,299 --> 00:26:39,750
and 148 rows and you don't need so many

430
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:43,169
active users in our community imagine

431
00:26:39,750 --> 00:26:47,280
there are only 12 active users and each

432
00:26:43,169 --> 00:26:50,700
of them has an ability to remember all

433
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:53,340
of his friends needs and skills this

434
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:58,289
community could be a very effective one

435
00:26:53,340 --> 00:27:01,379
so actually this is like the designs of

436
00:26:58,289 --> 00:27:03,470
our network the access layer application

437
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:06,270
layer and backbone they are right and

438
00:27:03,470 --> 00:27:08,760
speaking of the information handling

439
00:27:06,270 --> 00:27:10,980
model according to later speaking

440
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:14,700
natural language processing there is

441
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:16,260
speak retail and listen and according to

442
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:19,770
book of Elements of Style

443
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:23,039
there is writers radar and communicator

444
00:27:19,770 --> 00:27:27,090
and according to the new video and

445
00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:29,460
open-source framework for signal signal

446
00:27:27,090 --> 00:27:32,100
processing the source filter and sync

447
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:36,240
and according to email designs that are

448
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:39,658
except for the liver and store and for

449
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:42,720
the IP tables they are input/output and

450
00:27:39,659 --> 00:27:45,240
forward and for the MQTT the IOT

451
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:47,340
protocols the publisher broker and

452
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:51,000
subscriber and they have tags called

453
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:54,149
topics and for the twitter there is

454
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:58,559
trait retreat and knock actually we can

455
00:27:54,150 --> 00:28:02,540
learn from the common part of this is we

456
00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:05,090
often has a source a filter and a sink

457
00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:08,178
take cheddar for example the the like is

458
00:28:05,090 --> 00:28:11,120
basically the sink because the message

459
00:28:08,179 --> 00:28:13,520
will end after you press the like button

460
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:17,870
actually Twitter this the CEO of Twitter

461
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:21,889
wants to get rid of the like button note

462
00:28:17,870 --> 00:28:23,510
we can get from these major E's appears

463
00:28:21,890 --> 00:28:26,900
in case not very helpful for the

464
00:28:23,510 --> 00:28:29,540
community this should be avoided and

465
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:31,370
instead instead of private accessible

466
00:28:29,540 --> 00:28:33,918
technique notes we should encourage our

467
00:28:31,370 --> 00:28:37,159
members to publish their ideas their

468
00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:39,830
write-ups and their to some like

469
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:42,910
independent blogs or search for archives

470
00:28:39,830 --> 00:28:47,570
and each of the discussions should be

471
00:28:42,910 --> 00:28:52,450
accessible by afforded 800 members and

472
00:28:47,570 --> 00:28:59,030
this is an code excerpt from the year of

473
00:28:52,450 --> 00:29:03,860
1998 mark Crispin is the author of ima P

474
00:28:59,030 --> 00:29:06,530
which is used in email system this is

475
00:29:03,860 --> 00:29:09,439
very interesting because this part is

476
00:29:06,530 --> 00:29:13,040
his actually address and this part is

477
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:18,140
his email address but he thinks the

478
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:21,168
email is the internet this is the ideas

479
00:29:18,140 --> 00:29:26,090
or thoughts from the father of I am 80

480
00:29:21,169 --> 00:29:29,480
and so Tim berners-lee on the Left he

481
00:29:26,090 --> 00:29:32,959
invented the web and the windsurf

482
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:35,919
invented invented the internet but who

483
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:40,850
invented the email actually according to

484
00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:44,299
my research this is a quote and emails

485
00:29:40,850 --> 00:29:47,889
was never invented it evolved from very

486
00:29:44,299 --> 00:29:51,379
simple beginnings and the concept of it

487
00:29:47,890 --> 00:29:55,280
communicating by email from organization

488
00:29:51,380 --> 00:29:59,330
to organization is the impetus for the

489
00:29:55,280 --> 00:30:01,668
advent of Internet itself and it's often

490
00:29:59,330 --> 00:30:05,300
called the killer application of the

491
00:30:01,669 --> 00:30:08,600
Internet so

492
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:13,040
this one we have already shown the email

493
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:15,230
from Tim berners-lee and so why do

494
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:17,090
people love emails a lot of the

495
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:20,090
open-source communities chose email to

496
00:30:17,090 --> 00:30:24,860
collaborate like the Debian actually a

497
00:30:20,090 --> 00:30:29,720
lot of the operating the the whole

498
00:30:24,860 --> 00:30:33,620
office procedure of Debian is running on

499
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:37,550
email and Linux kernel and in my opinion

500
00:30:33,620 --> 00:30:40,520
people love email because the the old

501
00:30:37,550 --> 00:30:42,500
akuto are good all haskell headers

502
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:45,080
because they can choose your own client

503
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:48,230
as long as he speaks of same particles

504
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:50,840
and according to this link the emails

505
00:30:48,230 --> 00:30:55,850
wait for you and is pushed technology

506
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:59,540
and has a power of 1/2 men and and he

507
00:30:55,850 --> 00:31:02,360
said it has a very successful but very

508
00:30:59,540 --> 00:31:04,610
simple model we have the subject

509
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:05,860
actually the subject the magnetic needs

510
00:31:04,610 --> 00:31:09,919
the abstract

511
00:31:05,860 --> 00:31:11,870
likewise in scientific papers and except

512
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:16,880
for the network store messages and

513
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:21,770
threading this is the public access

514
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:25,730
behalf of IETF emails you can just type

515
00:31:21,770 --> 00:31:28,580
into your interesting interested group

516
00:31:25,730 --> 00:31:34,460
you can get up to all of the accessible

517
00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:41,600
emails by I'm ap and for the NCP or you

518
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:45,950
said the actually it is the satellite a

519
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:49,010
lot of satellites services the users

520
00:31:45,950 --> 00:31:52,940
will choose the narrowest and fastest

521
00:31:49,010 --> 00:31:58,190
servers to do the news and the servers

522
00:31:52,940 --> 00:32:01,580
will be synced later on I think this is

523
00:31:58,190 --> 00:32:05,450
sort of decentralized to some accent but

524
00:32:01,580 --> 00:32:06,330
I think this is very fast for messaging

525
00:32:05,450 --> 00:32:08,869
handling because

526
00:32:06,330 --> 00:32:13,529
users don't need to wait for the message

527
00:32:08,869 --> 00:32:15,168
machines he says instead of actually the

528
00:32:13,529 --> 00:32:19,049
message is waiting for you

529
00:32:15,169 --> 00:32:22,669
this man is a hero of Internet and he

530
00:32:19,049 --> 00:32:25,979
just rescued all of the you said

531
00:32:22,669 --> 00:32:28,859
archives by the tapes on his wall and

532
00:32:25,979 --> 00:32:31,409
later these archives off you said was

533
00:32:28,859 --> 00:32:35,580
imported to conquer groups so he can

534
00:32:31,409 --> 00:32:42,869
search back the Usenet archives because

535
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:46,139
thanks to mr. David Weisman Jim Jim

536
00:32:42,869 --> 00:32:48,629
ain't Ozark is bridge for polite

537
00:32:46,139 --> 00:32:49,918
indicate why he beaten and on TV our

538
00:32:48,629 --> 00:32:53,539
essence and medalist

539
00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:58,200
you can this is roughly about thirty

540
00:32:53,539 --> 00:33:01,499
thousands of channels that are serving

541
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:04,320
by Juventus world but I think the German

542
00:33:01,499 --> 00:33:08,339
dark hour facing some problems that

543
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:12,718
basically the this site was maintained

544
00:33:08,339 --> 00:33:17,190
by a single man before he's an active

545
00:33:12,719 --> 00:33:20,639
user of news in Emacs and so on the

546
00:33:17,190 --> 00:33:23,809
Linux kernel materials are worrying

547
00:33:20,639 --> 00:33:27,119
about this so a few years ago they

548
00:33:23,809 --> 00:33:30,229
developed a new project called public

549
00:33:27,119 --> 00:33:34,908
inbox stored so you can use it as a

550
00:33:30,229 --> 00:33:39,509
email receiver the MTA and all of the

551
00:33:34,909 --> 00:33:45,539
emails will be received by this some

552
00:33:39,509 --> 00:33:48,119
poor but very strong hold and and the

553
00:33:45,539 --> 00:33:51,839
best part of it is public inbox reward

554
00:33:48,119 --> 00:33:54,869
you can simply mirror all of the email

555
00:33:51,839 --> 00:33:58,649
archive spike in pool because each of

556
00:33:54,869 --> 00:34:01,259
the messages is a git commit so you

557
00:33:58,649 --> 00:34:04,529
clone the rebel you can hold a mirror of

558
00:34:01,259 --> 00:34:06,899
email archives and according to them

559
00:34:04,529 --> 00:34:09,599
they are doing the push model is

560
00:34:06,899 --> 00:34:13,828
of the instead of push model they are

561
00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:16,109
building the pool model because sometime

562
00:34:13,829 --> 00:34:18,569
you don't have to read all of the

563
00:34:16,109 --> 00:34:29,119
messages you just a sort for let me show

564
00:34:18,569 --> 00:34:35,549
you this I fire up a sovery okay and

565
00:34:29,119 --> 00:34:43,529
Laura dot Colonel sorry it's a bit of

566
00:34:35,549 --> 00:34:46,759
small wait a minute that's okay ml if

567
00:34:43,529 --> 00:34:49,319
you want to do some research about some

568
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:55,159
for example you want to read all of my

569
00:34:49,319 --> 00:34:58,529
email published by tours you can just

570
00:34:55,159 --> 00:35:02,039
search it and you can download it I as a

571
00:34:58,529 --> 00:35:06,809
mbox archive and for example you can

572
00:35:02,039 --> 00:35:09,450
search my some of my name and a few

573
00:35:06,809 --> 00:35:12,779
years ago threesome I think I easily

574
00:35:09,450 --> 00:35:16,230
find all of the discussions and patches

575
00:35:12,779 --> 00:35:18,900
from this project and you can clone the

576
00:35:16,230 --> 00:35:22,529
whole rebel is quite useful the best

577
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:25,650
part of it it is now served with an NTP

578
00:35:22,529 --> 00:35:28,770
for example that you can remember if you

579
00:35:25,650 --> 00:35:32,250
used up a 3m you just type into sorry

580
00:35:28,770 --> 00:35:37,130
too fast you tap into this command you

581
00:35:32,250 --> 00:35:42,170
can get access to the email archives of

582
00:35:37,130 --> 00:35:42,170
Linux or Linux kernel discussions

583
00:35:50,349 --> 00:35:58,790
so McGinn box.org can be deployed for

584
00:35:56,020 --> 00:36:04,190
for your own communities I think this is

585
00:35:58,790 --> 00:36:06,349
very promising project and for the

586
00:36:04,190 --> 00:36:08,599
newbies the kernel newbies Dorothy

587
00:36:06,349 --> 00:36:12,140
provides some very useful links

588
00:36:08,599 --> 00:36:17,540
documentary documented documents for the

589
00:36:12,140 --> 00:36:20,118
newbies and for the persons that cannot

590
00:36:17,540 --> 00:36:22,400
afford reading all of the messages they

591
00:36:20,119 --> 00:36:24,790
provide editorial digest remember we

592
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:27,680
shouldn't trust the commercial

593
00:36:24,790 --> 00:36:29,960
categorize but instead of the commercial

594
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:34,009
categorize err we should use editorial

595
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:37,609
digest for example this is a news from

596
00:36:34,010 --> 00:36:40,760
the source the alto en dotnet they

597
00:36:37,609 --> 00:36:43,759
provide a lot of the write-ups

598
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:46,490
of news by the human reporters they read

599
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:49,250
every emails from the open source

600
00:36:46,490 --> 00:36:51,770
discussions they publish some of the

601
00:36:49,250 --> 00:36:54,170
interesting things I call this the

602
00:36:51,770 --> 00:36:56,000
editorial digest actually internet

603
00:36:54,170 --> 00:36:58,940
Engineering Task Force they provide a

604
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:04,030
daily dose actually this is generated by

605
00:36:58,940 --> 00:37:08,570
a robot each day you can find different

606
00:37:04,030 --> 00:37:12,160
activities for the IETF and our way em

607
00:37:08,570 --> 00:37:16,780
they provide of weekly right up from the

608
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:19,720
editors on the mailing list and commits

609
00:37:16,780 --> 00:37:22,339
commits and news and articles

610
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:26,359
interesting articles from around the

611
00:37:22,339 --> 00:37:30,080
world and there is even some interesting

612
00:37:26,359 --> 00:37:34,430
robots that automatically summarize for

613
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:39,560
you but I haven't tried tried this also

614
00:37:34,430 --> 00:37:43,750
our practice final part I was a founder

615
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:47,259
of an open source community called tuna

616
00:37:43,750 --> 00:37:50,180
desperately basically tiller runs an

617
00:37:47,260 --> 00:37:51,740
open source mirror site in our country

618
00:37:50,180 --> 00:37:54,980
basically is one of the largest open

619
00:37:51,740 --> 00:38:00,899
source camera site and a part of them

620
00:37:54,980 --> 00:38:05,400
we also roughly we are wanting to

621
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:09,420
like the CCC in the Germany so our

622
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:13,260
practiced the first one is we want to

623
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:15,180
keep everyone raise everything so we

624
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:17,520
want to decrease the latency of each

625
00:38:15,180 --> 00:38:19,589
operation we want to keep machines waits

626
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:22,800
for human beings it's just instead of

627
00:38:19,590 --> 00:38:26,040
human waste for machines and the best

628
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:28,740
part of it we want to our members to do

629
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:34,680
database leak style news reading so that

630
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:37,470
you can get the whole picture so the

631
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:41,569
members just like for example like the

632
00:38:37,470 --> 00:38:46,169
SDF that org we log into a gateway and

633
00:38:41,570 --> 00:38:52,710
the information sources some of them are

634
00:38:46,170 --> 00:38:57,600
RSS so we use free to xec to pull them

635
00:38:52,710 --> 00:39:00,750
as a mailbox because if everything is

636
00:38:57,600 --> 00:39:02,370
put rev for the route times and that the

637
00:39:00,750 --> 00:39:07,860
human will be waiting for the machine

638
00:39:02,370 --> 00:39:13,140
for our so we fetch the news async by

639
00:39:07,860 --> 00:39:17,130
the machines and the gwa e is some of

640
00:39:13,140 --> 00:39:21,180
the public RSS like in the 30 thousands

641
00:39:17,130 --> 00:39:24,630
of the Tim are served in gwe using an

642
00:39:21,180 --> 00:39:29,220
NTP service protocol to fetch to alpine

643
00:39:24,630 --> 00:39:32,100
and some of our members prefer the RSS

644
00:39:29,220 --> 00:39:36,149
readers so but this part is very

645
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:40,620
important because the RSS RSS readers we

646
00:39:36,150 --> 00:39:43,980
have to feed back to as a new RSS feed

647
00:39:40,620 --> 00:39:48,480
that everyone pick up the interesting

648
00:39:43,980 --> 00:39:51,060
things to publish to a new collection so

649
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:54,360
that everyone is a filter instead of a

650
00:39:51,060 --> 00:39:57,630
signal sink right for the mailing list

651
00:39:54,360 --> 00:40:00,510
there are providers from the email

652
00:39:57,630 --> 00:40:03,090
services and Gmail and pop begin box and

653
00:40:00,510 --> 00:40:05,880
news groups all of them are

654
00:40:03,090 --> 00:40:09,290
pre-configured by the system

655
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:11,870
administrator so we just open new

656
00:40:09,290 --> 00:40:16,190
account for the members then all things

657
00:40:11,870 --> 00:40:18,200
are set up the next up is leave no one

658
00:40:16,190 --> 00:40:20,090
behind and bridge everything remember

659
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:22,490
there are a lot of different senior

660
00:40:20,090 --> 00:40:27,260
member rayj remember new and random

661
00:40:22,490 --> 00:40:32,390
members they have different news agents

662
00:40:27,260 --> 00:40:36,190
so we build up boat to like a switcher

663
00:40:32,390 --> 00:40:40,250
to preach the messages through them and

664
00:40:36,190 --> 00:40:43,040
we also provide editorial digest some of

665
00:40:40,250 --> 00:40:47,750
them are for the public some of them are

666
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:50,390
for the random members to catch up and

667
00:40:47,750 --> 00:40:53,650
the most part of the interesting part of

668
00:40:50,390 --> 00:40:56,509
it we the boat can be used as a

669
00:40:53,650 --> 00:40:59,930
administrators that execute some

670
00:40:56,510 --> 00:41:06,650
friendly roles like the sticker remover

671
00:40:59,930 --> 00:41:10,460
and some sort of the serious filter of

672
00:41:06,650 --> 00:41:15,160
the community discussions so for example

673
00:41:10,460 --> 00:41:18,200
a lot of thumbs up they basically are no

674
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:21,399
it's very toxic for a service community

675
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:27,020
is a proof of no work and people will

676
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:28,820
just push the fam'ly button and no one

677
00:41:27,020 --> 00:41:31,460
will see there are interesting things

678
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:35,270
and the worst part of it is different

679
00:41:31,460 --> 00:41:38,510
from the emoji it's very large stickers

680
00:41:35,270 --> 00:41:40,910
so it will flood the screen it's not

681
00:41:38,510 --> 00:41:44,570
very good for protective and very good

682
00:41:40,910 --> 00:41:47,600
not good for the helpful so a port is

683
00:41:44,570 --> 00:41:50,390
better because we can simply we cannot

684
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:53,000
trust our administrators we only trust

685
00:41:50,390 --> 00:41:56,509
the roles that can be enforced

686
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:59,390
automatically so basically we want to

687
00:41:56,510 --> 00:42:02,720
make human beings speak the language of

688
00:41:59,390 --> 00:42:08,379
human in real world if you want to push

689
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:12,140
this kind of things rose to a commercial

690
00:42:08,380 --> 00:42:14,840
products if you cannot push the product

691
00:42:12,140 --> 00:42:17,750
manager you can like me be like a hacker

692
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:19,790
file a patent and push again actually

693
00:42:17,750 --> 00:42:23,720
this is a real patent

694
00:42:19,790 --> 00:42:26,779
and speaking of the blogroll

695
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:29,950
and this is a surprisingly work method

696
00:42:26,780 --> 00:42:33,860
of our members each of them are

697
00:42:29,950 --> 00:42:36,759
publishing their thoughts on a is

698
00:42:33,860 --> 00:42:40,730
independent blog and we provide at least

699
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:44,810
actually is you know just a a markdown

700
00:42:40,730 --> 00:42:48,890
file served in github and this is a full

701
00:42:44,810 --> 00:42:53,080
list everyone can submit a pull request

702
00:42:48,890 --> 00:42:57,589
and we have a robot to actually Travis

703
00:42:53,080 --> 00:43:01,370
no Travis is yeah Travis daughter say

704
00:42:57,590 --> 00:43:03,910
guy to build up compiled the list into a

705
00:43:01,370 --> 00:43:07,180
single opml file that you can just

706
00:43:03,910 --> 00:43:11,779
subscribe to the single opml side then

707
00:43:07,180 --> 00:43:14,480
everything is subscribed it surprisingly

708
00:43:11,780 --> 00:43:17,560
works very interesting and we have

709
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:23,320
organized some weekly up meet up evens

710
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:26,930
actually we are not getting any fans but

711
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:29,900
remember everyone is a filter not the

712
00:43:26,930 --> 00:43:33,589
sink so the speaker local audiences

713
00:43:29,900 --> 00:43:38,660
remote audiences and async audiences we

714
00:43:33,590 --> 00:43:41,930
want to keep everyone heads a outgoing

715
00:43:38,660 --> 00:43:44,480
line and incoming line so for the

716
00:43:41,930 --> 00:43:47,210
speaker they can be yelled by the local

717
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:51,440
audiences and they can also be yelled or

718
00:43:47,210 --> 00:43:56,360
remotely by the demo this is a floating

719
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:59,900
comment coming software written by our

720
00:43:56,360 --> 00:44:02,660
members of tuna actually we run the

721
00:43:59,900 --> 00:44:05,540
software on the speaker's computer then

722
00:44:02,660 --> 00:44:09,620
the the comments will be floating on the

723
00:44:05,540 --> 00:44:14,720
slides so the remote audiences will be

724
00:44:09,620 --> 00:44:19,130
connected and we use obvious and to

725
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:22,970
provide the fees by unjinx rtmp to

726
00:44:19,130 --> 00:44:25,790
remote audiences and for the local

727
00:44:22,970 --> 00:44:27,919
audiences all the sound must be heard so

728
00:44:25,790 --> 00:44:29,900
the poll will build up some thing called

729
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:32,680
actually it's not build up just a

730
00:44:29,900 --> 00:44:36,790
combination of some very

731
00:44:32,680 --> 00:44:40,750
very inexpensive microphones that we

732
00:44:36,790 --> 00:44:43,960
call it's a poor man's mica array so in

733
00:44:40,750 --> 00:44:47,260
the in the discussion room everyone's

734
00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:50,500
sound can be heard by the poor man's mic

735
00:44:47,260 --> 00:44:53,290
re and provide to the remote speaker and

736
00:44:50,500 --> 00:44:55,630
I sing audiences actually there is no

737
00:44:53,290 --> 00:44:58,750
feedback line for the async audiences if

738
00:44:55,630 --> 00:45:01,720
you we want to we have to build some

739
00:44:58,750 --> 00:45:05,440
sort of time machine to for them to

740
00:45:01,720 --> 00:45:09,640
discuss okay some of my contributions

741
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:15,690
the last page I have been providing some

742
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:19,150
of the patches for alpine some of my

743
00:45:15,690 --> 00:45:23,440
this is my name some of my name and some

744
00:45:19,150 --> 00:45:27,400
of the public in box.org and some of the

745
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:30,150
fee to XE project so key takeaways the

746
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:33,640
first is no keep keep

747
00:45:30,150 --> 00:45:36,520
leave no one behind and we should bridge

748
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:39,220
everything respect each of the user

749
00:45:36,520 --> 00:45:42,940
agents and consider all members and

750
00:45:39,220 --> 00:45:45,549
newbies friendly we and we keep our

751
00:45:42,940 --> 00:45:48,880
senior members won't get support and we

752
00:45:45,550 --> 00:45:51,070
connect remote members and I think he's

753
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:52,680
a new thing we don't have to keep our

754
00:45:51,070 --> 00:45:56,080
members to stay online

755
00:45:52,680 --> 00:45:59,290
7:24 and they made her payments so we

756
00:45:56,080 --> 00:46:03,220
bridge local remote icing and speaker

757
00:45:59,290 --> 00:46:06,700
together and everyone reads

758
00:46:03,220 --> 00:46:10,620
everything to achieve this we the first

759
00:46:06,700 --> 00:46:14,799
one is we provide accessible archive so

760
00:46:10,620 --> 00:46:17,250
the message will wait for you and this

761
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:20,500
part I called is high for the high

762
00:46:17,250 --> 00:46:23,260
throughput in for handling the basically

763
00:46:20,500 --> 00:46:26,170
needs low latency and large volume of

764
00:46:23,260 --> 00:46:28,990
message handling and we have to speed up

765
00:46:26,170 --> 00:46:31,900
and let machines wait for human and no

766
00:46:28,990 --> 00:46:34,509
information cemetery avoid report by

767
00:46:31,900 --> 00:46:39,430
level two and provide large volume of

768
00:46:34,510 --> 00:46:41,530
them and trustee the categorize errs do

769
00:46:39,430 --> 00:46:42,250
not trust the commercial categorize errs

770
00:46:41,530 --> 00:46:44,890
and

771
00:46:42,250 --> 00:46:47,200
from the even for the same group of

772
00:46:44,890 --> 00:46:49,810
people like we should build up more

773
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:53,020
channels or more discussion groups for

774
00:46:49,810 --> 00:46:55,330
them and we provide a datura digester

775
00:46:53,020 --> 00:46:58,930
for those who cannot afford to read read

776
00:46:55,330 --> 00:47:01,750
every messages for them and helpful and

777
00:46:58,930 --> 00:47:04,540
productive we rule out toxic behaviors

778
00:47:01,750 --> 00:47:08,349
with support and no black hole everyone

779
00:47:04,540 --> 00:47:10,599
should provide feedback and human

780
00:47:08,349 --> 00:47:13,510
Rossing we should encourage our members

781
00:47:10,599 --> 00:47:16,359
to broadcast us the skills and needs so

782
00:47:13,510 --> 00:47:26,680
that help will find you and you will

783
00:47:16,359 --> 00:47:36,340
find the helps okay thank you so any

784
00:47:26,680 --> 00:47:39,069
questions will be welcomed over this

785
00:47:36,340 --> 00:47:43,150
information handling this looks to me

786
00:47:39,070 --> 00:47:47,500
more like for the techs talking North

787
00:47:43,150 --> 00:47:49,900
Texas informations that renews our email

788
00:47:47,500 --> 00:47:52,680
so you know nowadays and in order to

789
00:47:49,900 --> 00:47:52,680
share more

790
00:48:13,670 --> 00:48:19,470
your question was if we can take

791
00:48:16,680 --> 00:48:22,020
advantage of the YouTube and my opinion

792
00:48:19,470 --> 00:48:26,129
maybe we can grab the automatic

793
00:48:22,020 --> 00:48:29,430
generated a caption from it and to some

794
00:48:26,130 --> 00:48:34,230
data mining no not the remaining I want

795
00:48:29,430 --> 00:48:37,529
to so that people members can grab the

796
00:48:34,230 --> 00:48:41,520
keywords from it so if I will find the

797
00:48:37,530 --> 00:48:44,510
right YouTube and for the tools we are

798
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:49,589
using is OBS is open source code

799
00:48:44,510 --> 00:48:53,550
actually you can break we can set up a

800
00:48:49,589 --> 00:48:56,880
lot of the microphones and the webcams

801
00:48:53,550 --> 00:49:01,320
and you can be a director of your own

802
00:48:56,880 --> 00:49:05,220
using OBS to put and push the stream to

803
00:49:01,320 --> 00:49:19,140
YouTube or your self hosted rtmp server

804
00:49:05,220 --> 00:49:23,118
I think thank you okay thank you for

805
00:49:19,140 --> 00:49:23,118
your time have a good lunch

806
