1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:06,839
so from April 3rd of 2000 our very first

2
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:09,330
black hat to today I'd like to talk a

3
00:00:06,839 --> 00:00:12,360
little bit about how we've changed today

4
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:14,820
black hat gives out scholarships to

5
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:17,460
people who don't have the resources to

6
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:20,130
pay a full pass but are still interested

7
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:21,990
in passionate about security and so they

8
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:25,529
write white papers they do some research

9
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:27,419
we review it and if it's acceptable and

10
00:00:25,529 --> 00:00:29,369
we think that people have a desire to

11
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:31,769
learn more we give them a scholarship

12
00:00:29,369 --> 00:00:34,530
pass so we gave out one hundred and

13
00:00:31,769 --> 00:00:36,620
three scholarship passes to black hat so

14
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:38,969
if you have one please raise your hand

15
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:44,660
raise your hand raise your hand right on

16
00:00:38,969 --> 00:00:47,340
let's give them a round of applause and

17
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:48,809
we're really a friendly group we like

18
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:51,239
asking questions we like being

19
00:00:48,809 --> 00:00:53,839
challenged so if you see somebody that's

20
00:00:51,239 --> 00:00:56,129
a scholarship just up and say hi

21
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:58,170
introduce yourself welcome them to the

22
00:00:56,129 --> 00:01:02,820
community and hopefully we'll be working

23
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:05,250
alongside them for years to come also we

24
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:08,700
have people here from over 83 different

25
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:11,580
countries so it's not just a regional

26
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:12,869
show in Southeast Asia it's pretty much

27
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:14,429
an international show with

28
00:01:12,869 --> 00:01:16,409
representatives from all over the world

29
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:18,689
and every year I kind of do this as a

30
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:22,290
thing but I have a list of people who

31
00:01:18,689 --> 00:01:24,539
are here a single representative from a

32
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:27,780
country so these are countries that only

33
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:29,549
have one person in attendance so you're

34
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:32,070
special if your your the the lone

35
00:01:29,549 --> 00:01:35,960
survivor from your country of fear if

36
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:39,419
you're here Albania Algeria Angola

37
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:44,460
Argentine Argentina Azerbaijan Bahamas

38
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:48,600

Portugal Senegal Sierra Leone Uganda and

43
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:03,179
one from the US Virgin Islands so

44
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:07,270
welcome thank you for taking the time

45
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:10,970
[Applause]

46
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:14,209
okay so I have looked some opening

47
00:02:10,970 --> 00:02:17,780
remarks and then we'll introduce our

48
00:02:14,209 --> 00:02:22,640
keynote and then we'll start the show so

49
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:24,920
I think there's by a show of hands here

50
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:27,589
who here thinks that in the future

51
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:29,600
since we're forward-looking show of

52
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:31,880
hands who thinks the future and the

53
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:35,840
technology will be more complex than it

54
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:40,820
is today who thinks it will be the same

55
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:42,380
or less complex in the future right okay

56
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:45,200
nobody ruins their hands for less

57
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:48,500
complex who thinks it will the

58
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:53,619
technology will become more fragile by

59
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:57,290
show of hands more fragile less fragile

60
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:59,360
one two three four okay

61
00:02:57,290 --> 00:03:01,850
and who thinks the future is more

62
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:03,920
automated more decisions will be taken

63
00:03:01,850 --> 00:03:07,910
away from humans and they'll have to be

64
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:12,950
automated okay less automated or more

65
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:15,829
humans in control okay none okay so and

66
00:03:12,950 --> 00:03:17,420
finally I guess I can use the word

67
00:03:15,829 --> 00:03:20,150
integrated or I can use the word

68
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:22,548
dependent but who thinks our future is

69
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:27,850
more integrated or maybe more we're more

70
00:03:22,549 --> 00:03:30,470
dependent on the technology right less

71
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:32,870
ok well that's that's our future right

72
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:34,970
it's more fragile it's more integrated

73
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:39,110
it's more complex it's more automated

74
00:03:34,970 --> 00:03:41,840
and how do you deal with this and so

75
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:44,769
generally when you need rules around new

76
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:47,840
things whether it's telephones or rail

77
00:03:44,769 --> 00:03:49,970
we look to government's for rules we

78
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:52,880
look to companies to self-regulate or we

79
00:03:49,970 --> 00:03:54,650
look to a civil society to help show us

80
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:59,930
the path and I don't think it's gonna be

81
00:03:54,650 --> 00:04:03,560
any different in cyber and so what will

82
00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:04,670
the Wills of the road be well we're

83
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:07,519
going to be the people that are pretty

84
00:04:04,670 --> 00:04:08,958
much building the road and other people

85
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:10,459
maybe governments or companies will be

86
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:10,960
telling us sort of like don't move the

87
00:04:10,459 --> 00:04:14,170
road they

88
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:15,640
our only build five lanes over here but

89
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:18,789
really the decisions we're going to be

90
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:22,360
making are going to be influencing this

91
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:24,370
road and you can see different

92
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:27,490
governments have different approaches

93
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:29,320
and as time goes by I'm more and more

94
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:32,770
convinced that there's going to be two

95
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:34,270
super powers in cyberspace it's going to

96
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:36,700
be the United States and it's going to

97
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:38,229
be China and I think there's other

98
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:40,690
there'll be a lot of other players

99
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:41,470
Europe will be very important but I

100
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:45,640
don't think they're going to be a

101
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:49,690
superpower for a number of reasons and

102
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:51,490
so if that's the case and if you believe

103
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:55,180
that internet problems are global

104
00:04:51,490 --> 00:04:56,440
problems then that means that the two

105
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:59,320
superpowers are gonna have to work with

106
00:04:56,440 --> 00:05:01,510
each other to solve basic internet

107
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:04,390
problems all right where the routers

108
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:06,159
manufactured China and America where the

109
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:07,479
phone's manufactured all right the

110
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:09,430
infrastructure is coming from

111
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:11,260
essentially two places in the world if

112
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:15,670
there's a problem it's gonna have to get

113
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:19,060
fixed in one of those two places and so

114
00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:23,500
I think we need to work where and when

115
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:26,110
we can between the two superpowers and

116
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:28,000
everybody needs to acknowledge that

117
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:30,550
while maybe of Russia that's a great

118
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,800
spoiler I mean nobody spoils like Russia

119
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:35,080
I mean they can rack up party like

120
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:38,100
you've never seen they can come in and

121
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:41,710
step all over your election or whatever

122
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:42,940
but they're not building phones when was

123
00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:47,380
the last time you bought a network

124
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:48,610
switch from Russia never right and

125
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:52,000
you're probably never gonna buy a

126
00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:53,770
network gear from Russia so they're

127
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:57,460
great spoiler but they're not a

128
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:59,020
superpower right and sometimes we treat

129
00:05:57,460 --> 00:06:00,580
them as if they are and I don't think

130
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:02,590
that's that's distorting our view of how

131
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:05,380
how it works

132
00:06:02,590 --> 00:06:08,739
and finally you know how is cyber

133
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:11,260
different well we talk about cyber being

134
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:16,480
the fifth domain are there's air land

135
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:19,620
sea space and then cyber and there was a

136
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:22,450
big debate over this and I think that

137
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:24,310
I'll go along with cyber's being a fifth

138
00:06:22,450 --> 00:06:26,860
domain but it's different

139
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:28,750
for example if you're flying an airplane

140
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:31,810
over my country and we're in a time of

141
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:34,480
war and I shoot down your airplane the

142
00:06:31,810 --> 00:06:37,630
sky is still the sky I think your boat

143
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:40,780
the ocean is still the ocean right I

144
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:44,230
blow up your tank land is still the land

145
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:47,229
but if you attack my router you attack

146
00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:49,720
my infrastructure I'm gonna change my

147
00:06:47,230 --> 00:06:52,810
access control rules I'm gonna update my

148
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:54,820
soft or I'm gonna reroute my traffic and

149
00:06:52,810 --> 00:06:57,220
then the networks different now the

150
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:58,750
fifth domain just changed and if we do

151
00:06:57,220 --> 00:07:01,870
this enough times if you have enough

152
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:03,700
conflict in cyberspace cyberspace will

153
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:06,550
change it will be a different

154
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:08,680
infrastructure and then the question

155
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:11,380
becomes is that an Internet we want to

156
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:13,870
live with what kind of Internet are we

157
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:16,210
leaving to our children if we fight over

158
00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:19,630
the Internet long enough it might not be

159
00:07:16,210 --> 00:07:24,280
that desirable of a location not that

160
00:07:19,630 --> 00:07:26,050
way in the other four domains so finally

161
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:28,690
in Singapore one of the interesting

162
00:07:26,050 --> 00:07:30,760
things is they also say it's all flat

163
00:07:28,690 --> 00:07:32,560
terrain you know in the four domains you

164
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:35,320
have high points you have high ground

165
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:37,570
you have rules of the terrain but in

166
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:40,450
cyberspace it's flat it's digital you're

167
00:07:37,570 --> 00:07:42,300
everywhere at once I would argue that's

168
00:07:40,450 --> 00:07:45,280
not true either

169
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:49,710
we're in Singapore why are we in

170
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:52,809
Singapore Singapore is not a superpower

171
00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:55,810
but it has a superpower like quality it

172
00:07:52,810 --> 00:07:59,289
has the rule of law and if you have the

173
00:07:55,810 --> 00:08:01,360
rule of law and you're predictable guess

174
00:07:59,289 --> 00:08:03,789
what companies want to build

175
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:06,070
infrastructure in your country where do

176
00:08:03,789 --> 00:08:08,169
you think the Amazon data centers

177
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:10,180
through Google plexus the Netflix data

178
00:08:08,169 --> 00:08:12,490
centers are going to be they're going to

179
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:15,100
be in Singapore because they have rule

180
00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:16,900
of law so the rule of law will create a

181
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:20,410
gravity which will draw in

182
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:23,919
infrastructure overseas cables data

183
00:08:20,410 --> 00:08:25,600
centers that will become so dense that

184
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:27,849
and hold so much information that you

185
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:30,910
will not be able to move the data away

186
00:08:27,850 --> 00:08:33,729
and do compute on it and move the data

187
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:36,640
back the trend is you have to do the

188
00:08:33,729 --> 00:08:38,110
compute where the data is the overseas

189
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:40,390
fiber links are just not fast

190
00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:42,550
to move all this petabytes around right

191
00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:45,090
so there will be geography where the

192
00:08:42,549 --> 00:08:48,880
data center where does the data lie and

193
00:08:45,090 --> 00:08:50,170
so in this new world of geography of

194
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:52,300
cyberspace

195
00:08:50,170 --> 00:08:54,010
there are definitely going to be winners

196
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:55,359
and losers there's going to be people

197
00:08:54,010 --> 00:08:58,030
can take advantage of it

198
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:59,680
and so we're going to be the people

199
00:08:58,030 --> 00:09:04,180
building those data centers protecting

200
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:05,920
those data centers defending them so I

201
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:09,310
just want to leave you with a thought

202
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:11,380
that future conflicts can permanently

203
00:09:09,310 --> 00:09:14,079
change our infrastructure and

204
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:16,420
permanently change the type of world we

205
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:20,890
live in so keep that in mind when you're

206
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:24,849
hearing the keynote so now it's my

207
00:09:20,890 --> 00:09:27,100
pleasure to introduce our sponsor

208
00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:30,310
Infoblox has been supporting blackhat

209
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:32,320
for years and I want to introduce Chris

210
00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:36,069
loserman who's the principal security

211
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:39,340
architect for Infoblox he spent over 30

212
00:09:36,070 --> 00:09:42,940
years in the US government intelligence

213
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:45,880
both sides offense and defense so he has

214
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:49,060
a deep understanding of what goes on out

215
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:52,000
there and he's recently turned that

216
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:53,800
attention into a defensive mindset to

217
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:57,400
help companies and users protect

218
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:59,469
themselves from what's going on so thank

219
00:09:57,400 --> 00:10:02,880
you very much my pleasure introduced

220
00:09:59,470 --> 00:10:02,880
Chris thank you

221
00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:08,070
good morning man I love Singapore by the

222
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:09,600
way this place is beautiful

223
00:10:08,070 --> 00:10:12,840
especially when it was about four

224
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:14,790
degrees Celsius in DC when I left and in

225
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:19,410
case you're Quan during I am about two

226
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:22,439
meters tall it I get a lot of looks up

227
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:24,089
so quick show of hands how many are here

228
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:28,590
because your boss told you that you're

229
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:30,630
coming good everybody's interested one

230
00:10:28,590 --> 00:10:32,550
of the one of the key points in that is

231
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:35,660
is is disinterest and that's really a

232
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:39,170
big problem let's give you a quick story

233
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:42,089
there's a building in San Francisco and

234
00:10:39,170 --> 00:10:44,370
talking about some of the limitations

235
00:10:42,090 --> 00:10:45,780
the builders took some shortcuts it's

236
00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:50,220
called the Millennium building it's

237
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:52,980
built 10 years ago and it has now is now

238
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:55,080
sunk into the ground more than they ever

239
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:57,420
expected to do over the lifetime of the

240
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:59,280
building and why because they didn't

241
00:10:57,420 --> 00:11:01,650
build it on a good solid foundation so

242
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:03,000
we'll talk about that for a minute so

243
00:11:01,650 --> 00:11:04,890
what if I were to tell you that there is

244
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,480
a vendor category they can absolutely

245
00:11:04,890 --> 00:11:11,340
guarantee you defence against

246
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:13,830
cyberattacks anybody interested nobody's

247
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:15,210
interested in that I'm not trying to

248
00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:18,420
sell you anything here I don't even

249
00:11:15,210 --> 00:11:20,640
represent them it's a PC all you have to

250
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:22,410
do is flip the power switch you don't

251
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:24,000
have to worry about it so what if I were

252
00:11:22,410 --> 00:11:25,140
to tell you that you can reduce ninety

253
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:29,850
ninety two percent of your

254
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:32,520
vulnerabilities just by one action fire

255
00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:34,500
all of your employees neither one of

256
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:36,930
those is realistic so we have to really

257
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:38,520
fight through all of the attacker

258
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:41,130
activities that are coming into our

259
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:44,220
networks all of the noise all of the the

260
00:11:41,130 --> 00:11:47,730
challenges that we present to ourselves

261
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:49,980
and that they present to us so with that

262
00:11:47,730 --> 00:11:52,100
there's three foundational aspects that

263
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:57,270
I really want to focus on and that is

264
00:11:52,100 --> 00:12:00,990
having skilled people having proven and

265
00:11:57,270 --> 00:12:02,760
flexible processes processes that that

266
00:12:00,990 --> 00:12:04,200
you can adopt the things that you do

267
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:06,330
today so when you have an event in your

268
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:08,370
environment what do you do what how do

269
00:12:06,330 --> 00:12:11,280
you respond to that can you automate

270
00:12:08,370 --> 00:12:12,990
that can you build upon that and then

271
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:14,819
technologies that interact and

272
00:12:12,990 --> 00:12:16,800
communicate with each other that's the

273
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:19,160
single biggest complaint

274
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:21,630
amongst most organizations that I help

275
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:24,449
mature their cybersecurity programs is

276
00:12:21,630 --> 00:12:26,730
as why can't benders communicate so

277
00:12:24,450 --> 00:12:29,160
getting to that point of being able to

278
00:12:26,730 --> 00:12:31,290
automate an orchestra but once you have

279
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:33,810
that foundation there are really three

280
00:12:31,290 --> 00:12:35,730
things that you need and power of three

281
00:12:33,810 --> 00:12:37,979
really three things that you need and

282
00:12:35,730 --> 00:12:39,990
that is visibility into your network

283
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:42,959
infrastructure into your network

284
00:12:39,990 --> 00:12:46,079
environment so network intelligence you

285
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:48,719
need threat visibility and then you need

286
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:51,689
a communicating ecosystem and having all

287
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:54,390
of that together can help really drive

288
00:12:51,690 --> 00:12:56,490
and mature your cybersecurity program so

289
00:12:54,390 --> 00:12:59,699
on behalf of all of us vendors

290
00:12:56,490 --> 00:13:01,529
welcome to blackhat 2019 thank you and

291
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:04,680
please come visit us next door across

292
00:13:01,529 --> 00:13:08,700
the hall and I challenge you to bring

293
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:12,329
your bring your your challenges your

294
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:14,910
problems to us and help us provide

295
00:13:12,329 --> 00:13:17,040
solutions to you that's the that's the

296
00:13:14,910 --> 00:13:19,260
biggest single thing that we will

297
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:21,890
provide value to each other so with that

298
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:21,890
thank you

299
00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:34,599
okay so now it is my great pleasure to

300
00:13:30,130 --> 00:13:38,770
introduce our keynote nico i ponen -

301
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:42,580
chief well who doesn't know Miko chief

302
00:13:38,770 --> 00:13:45,130
research officer at f-secure located in

303
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:47,470
helsinki he's been around

304
00:13:45,130 --> 00:13:49,090
well we've been around about forever for

305
00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:51,970
a long long time decades and decades and

306
00:13:49,090 --> 00:13:53,380
it's really fascinating to watch your

307
00:13:51,970 --> 00:13:56,830
peers in the industry grow in

308
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:59,110
development and just recently miko has

309
00:13:56,830 --> 00:14:02,290
joined the advisory board for the

310
00:13:59,110 --> 00:14:04,450
monetary authority here in singapore so

311
00:14:02,290 --> 00:14:09,040
he'll also be helping keep your money

312
00:14:04,450 --> 00:14:10,660
safe if you live or Bank in Singapore so

313
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:14,140
he's going to talk a little bit about

314
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:17,079
our future arms races our current arms

315
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:19,480
race and how he sees these races playing

316
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:22,360
out in the future and how the decisions

317
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:26,590
we make now are going to influence how

318
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:28,930
those races are won or lost so with that

319
00:14:26,590 --> 00:14:40,290
I'd like you to give a warm welcome to

320
00:14:28,930 --> 00:14:46,140
Miko good morning everybody

321
00:14:40,290 --> 00:14:49,750
so my name is Miko and I used to be

322
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:54,130
really really worried about the third

323
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:58,600
world war I was born in 1960s I was a

324
00:14:54,130 --> 00:15:01,689
teenager in 1970s and 1980s in the

325
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:06,940
middle of the Cold War and I really

326
00:15:01,690 --> 00:15:09,700
truly was afraid that the next world war

327
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:13,180
would become a reality and that would be

328
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:15,970
a nuclear war when you were living in

329
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:20,290
the middle of the in the middle of the

330
00:15:15,970 --> 00:15:22,060
arms race of the nuclear kind it was

331
00:15:20,290 --> 00:15:24,250
really hard to escape the fact that if

332
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:26,380
in indeed they would become a real

333
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:28,740
conflict it would very quickly become a

334
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:35,410
world war and it would be a nuclear

335
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:37,960
world war and I guess well I know that

336
00:15:35,410 --> 00:15:38,920
this has changed we're no longer very in

337
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:43,420
our everyday life

338
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:46,030
about nuclear holocaust now there are

339
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:49,120
tens of thousands of nuclear warheads on

340
00:15:46,030 --> 00:15:52,030
this planet right now they haven't gone

341
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:55,630
away we've been able to reduce them out

342
00:15:52,030 --> 00:15:57,339
of nuclear war it's a little bit but it

343
00:15:55,630 --> 00:16:00,100
is still a very much reality that

344
00:15:57,340 --> 00:16:02,440
nuclear weapons exist however we're not

345
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:06,940
worried about a nuclear war like we used

346
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:10,600
to be 20 years ago nuclear weapons are a

347
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:14,680
perfect example of a weapon which was

348
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:18,610
built or the power of deterrence nuclear

349
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:21,069
weapons have been used in war two times

350
00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:23,110
in mankind's history the rest of the

351
00:16:21,070 --> 00:16:26,220
power of nuclear weapons has for decades

352
00:16:23,110 --> 00:16:30,610
and decades being in deterrence in

353
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:33,580
knowing who has nuclear weapons and then

354
00:16:30,610 --> 00:16:35,410
not starting a conflict with those who

355
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:37,660
have nuclear weapons because they have

356
00:16:35,410 --> 00:16:43,689
nuclear weapons this is how deterrence

357
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:46,709
works and deterrence is changing when we

358
00:16:43,690 --> 00:16:50,320
look at how conflicts play out today

359
00:16:46,710 --> 00:16:52,870
they play out very differently because

360
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:58,990
indeed we have different domains for

361
00:16:52,870 --> 00:17:02,170
conflict different domains for war so I

362
00:16:58,990 --> 00:17:06,970
live in Helsinki Finland up there in in

363
00:17:02,170 --> 00:17:10,060
Northern Europe Finland has 1,300

364
00:17:06,970 --> 00:17:13,000
kilometers of border with the biggest

365
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:16,270
country on the planet Russia both of my

366
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:21,220
grandfather's fought the Russians in the

367
00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:24,040
Second World War so we've always I we've

368
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:26,530
always had this very concrete look into

369
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:29,139
world geopolitics and how it matters and

370
00:17:26,530 --> 00:17:31,360
I've been looking at conflict all my

371
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:35,200
life and when you look at the longer

372
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:39,100
history it's quite clear how technology

373
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:42,310
is shaping conflict how technology is

374
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:46,260
shaping the wars we fight if you look at

375
00:17:42,310 --> 00:17:48,669
the wars we the mankind used to fight

376
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:50,230
thousands of years ago or hundreds of

377
00:17:48,670 --> 00:17:52,750
years ago where we didn't have a

378
00:17:50,230 --> 00:17:54,640
technology to

379
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:57,280
do anything else except swords and the

380
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:59,050
bow and arrow the only kind of conflict

381
00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:00,700
they would have was land war then we

382
00:17:59,050 --> 00:18:03,760
could good enough technology so we could

383
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:08,860
build warships which means we got sea

384
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:11,470
war but the innovation of sea war did

385
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:14,260
not take away land war what happened was

386
00:18:11,470 --> 00:18:17,950
a conflict expanded now we had conflicts

387
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:19,600
on both land and sea and technology has

388
00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:22,630
done this over and over again the

389
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:25,419
innovation of fighter jets has created a

390
00:18:22,630 --> 00:18:28,830
war innovation of satellites and stuff

391
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:33,540
has created space war and now today

392
00:18:28,830 --> 00:18:35,889
cyber space war five domains

393
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:40,360
that's where conflicts play out today

394
00:18:35,890 --> 00:18:43,050
and when you look at current conflicts

395
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:45,669
they play out in all of these domains a

396
00:18:43,050 --> 00:18:47,639
good example is the conflict going on

397
00:18:45,670 --> 00:18:50,080
right now between Russia and Ukraine

398
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:53,110
that's a remarkable conflict is the

399
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:56,830
first war we have in continental Europe

400
00:18:53,110 --> 00:19:02,649
for decades and that war is being fought

401
00:18:56,830 --> 00:19:06,370
right now on land on sea in air in space

402
00:19:02,650 --> 00:19:10,600
and in cyberspace in all of this but

403
00:19:06,370 --> 00:19:14,669
it's important to remember that this is

404
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:18,340
not very dense there will be new domains

405
00:19:14,670 --> 00:19:20,500
right now it's hard to imagine what

406
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:23,260
could be the sixth seventh or eighth

407
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:25,420
domain but technology will continue to

408
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:29,020
shape the domains where we fight our

409
00:19:25,420 --> 00:19:32,380
conflicts mankind is not going to stop

410
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:32,860
fighting we're good at fighting we love

411
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:35,230
fighting

412
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:37,419
we love war we keep forgetting the

413
00:19:35,230 --> 00:19:39,660
horrors of wars every couple of decades

414
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:44,230
every couple of every couple of

415
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:46,210
generations Wars will be around for

416
00:19:44,230 --> 00:19:48,850
future generations to suffer from and

417
00:19:46,210 --> 00:19:52,750
they will be fought in new domains right

418
00:19:48,850 --> 00:19:58,540
now it's the five we know and the arms

419
00:19:52,750 --> 00:20:02,350
race is now squarely in the cyberspace

420
00:19:58,540 --> 00:20:06,100
area in fact I believe we are in the

421
00:20:02,350 --> 00:20:08,500
very beginning of the cyber arms race

422
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:12,639
the previous entrees nuclear arms race

423
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:16,660
that went on for 60 years it's largely

424
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:20,290
gone now and it might might very well be

425
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:25,480
that we will be spending the next 60

426
00:20:20,290 --> 00:20:27,820
years in cyber arms race but let's think

427
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:31,090
a little bit about what could be the

428
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:34,120
next domains for war next domains for

429
00:20:31,090 --> 00:20:36,970
conflict well it's quite clear that

430
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:39,250
robotics and drones are very much

431
00:20:36,970 --> 00:20:44,020
already a reality whether they are

432
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:46,690
flying drones or or battlefield drones

433
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:49,690
or even robots which can go around and

434
00:20:46,690 --> 00:20:51,630
shoot however today basically all of

435
00:20:49,690 --> 00:20:55,780
these are still being controlled by

436
00:20:51,630 --> 00:20:57,940
humans they don't select their target on

437
00:20:55,780 --> 00:21:00,460
their own they don't kill on their own

438
00:20:57,940 --> 00:21:02,260
there's no technical reason why they

439
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:05,710
couldn't do this already there are

440
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:09,280
ethical reasons we don't like the idea

441
00:21:05,710 --> 00:21:11,770
that a machine selects who should be

442
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:17,680
killed and who shouldn't be killed but

443
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:22,330
this is under an immense pressure there

444
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:25,450
are very big forces driving us towards a

445
00:21:22,330 --> 00:21:28,389
world where machines will kill on their

446
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:32,220
own when you think about battlefield

447
00:21:28,390 --> 00:21:34,570
drones whether they fly or drive around

448
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:38,530
one of the biggest problems for the

449
00:21:34,570 --> 00:21:40,210
operators of these drones or robots is

450
00:21:38,530 --> 00:21:43,270
that they have to have a remote

451
00:21:40,210 --> 00:21:44,860
connection to this now obviously the

452
00:21:43,270 --> 00:21:47,860
connection can be done stru through

453
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:51,010
strong crypto so there's no easy way for

454
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:53,199
an outsider to hijack drones or robots

455
00:21:51,010 --> 00:21:55,120
like this but it's fairly easy to

456
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:56,980
disrupt the connection we're speaking

457
00:21:55,120 --> 00:22:00,370
about radio connectivity and you can

458
00:21:56,980 --> 00:22:02,530
just jam radio waves now if your problem

459
00:22:00,370 --> 00:22:05,860
is that you want to operate drones or

460
00:22:02,530 --> 00:22:08,170
robots in a battle area and your

461
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:09,820
connections are jammed how do you solve

462
00:22:08,170 --> 00:22:11,710
it well you just get rid of the

463
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:14,200
connection you just program the machine

464
00:22:11,710 --> 00:22:17,080
to do its own decisions which is

465
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:19,270
effectively creating a killer robot this

466
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:19,779
is what's happening right now there's

467
00:22:19,270 --> 00:22:21,759
plenty of

468
00:22:19,779 --> 00:22:24,519
nology which good dude is already and it

469
00:22:21,759 --> 00:22:25,440
might happen and I think we shouldn't do

470
00:22:24,519 --> 00:22:29,289
this

471
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:30,669
well this domain robotics isn't really

472
00:22:29,289 --> 00:22:32,408
the whole new domain it's just an

473
00:22:30,669 --> 00:22:34,539
extension of the existing domains they

474
00:22:32,409 --> 00:22:36,940
are completely new domains for conflict

475
00:22:34,539 --> 00:22:38,979
which we could see as the sixth and

476
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:43,989
seventh domain for conflict

477
00:22:38,979 --> 00:22:47,309
for example DNA how could a conflict or

478
00:22:43,989 --> 00:22:49,840
war play out when DNA warfare is at play

479
00:22:47,309 --> 00:22:52,539
we don't really know just like we had no

480
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:54,939
idea how cyber conflict could play out

481
00:22:52,539 --> 00:22:56,789
thirty years ago they could guess but we

482
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:59,080
wouldn't really know or how about

483
00:22:56,789 --> 00:23:02,589
nanotechnology I guess we could imagine

484
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:07,049
a bomber flying over a battlefield

485
00:23:02,589 --> 00:23:09,879
dropping millions of nanobots on top of

486
00:23:07,049 --> 00:23:13,330
foreign soldiers which would enter their

487
00:23:09,879 --> 00:23:15,549
blunt wings and do whatever sound

488
00:23:13,330 --> 00:23:18,428
science fiction then again so did cyber

489
00:23:15,549 --> 00:23:19,149
warfare sound science-fiction a couple

490
00:23:18,429 --> 00:23:22,149
of decades ago

491
00:23:19,149 --> 00:23:28,089
or how about well artificial

492
00:23:22,149 --> 00:23:31,449
intelligence now I'm very well aware how

493
00:23:28,089 --> 00:23:33,908
machine learning and AI are the current

494
00:23:31,450 --> 00:23:36,009
buzz words right now when you walk

495
00:23:33,909 --> 00:23:39,279
across the corridor and you go to the

496
00:23:36,009 --> 00:23:40,839
the hall where companies are talking

497
00:23:39,279 --> 00:23:43,179
about what they do everybody's doing

498
00:23:40,839 --> 00:23:44,379
something with machine learning which is

499
00:23:43,179 --> 00:23:45,820
absolutely true because we're doing

500
00:23:44,379 --> 00:23:49,359
machine learning ourselves it's very

501
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:51,639
very powerful but then again I remember

502
00:23:49,359 --> 00:23:54,789
reading about machine learning and

503
00:23:51,639 --> 00:24:01,119
artificial intelligence from magazines

504
00:23:54,789 --> 00:24:03,519
in the 1980s already in the 1980s like

505
00:24:01,119 --> 00:24:05,769
almost 40 years ago 35 years ago

506
00:24:03,519 --> 00:24:11,320
something like that this has been a long

507
00:24:05,769 --> 00:24:14,700
time coming and we seem to have no easy

508
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:16,418
way to define what we actually mean by

509
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:20,789
artificial intelligence

510
00:24:16,419 --> 00:24:26,739
especially with wide AI and general AI

511
00:24:20,789 --> 00:24:28,658
how do we actually define this but if

512
00:24:26,739 --> 00:24:32,110
there will be a moment in mankind's

513
00:24:28,659 --> 00:24:34,870
history where we will demote ourselves

514
00:24:32,110 --> 00:24:36,969
the second most intelligent being on the

515
00:24:34,870 --> 00:24:40,239
planet that's gonna be a pretty big deal

516
00:24:36,970 --> 00:24:43,419
in fact it seems like a pretty basic

517
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:45,700
evolutionary mistake to invite a

518
00:24:43,419 --> 00:24:49,029
superior intelligence into your own

519
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:52,419
biosphere but it that could just happen

520
00:24:49,029 --> 00:24:57,100
during our lifetime and we can only

521
00:24:52,419 --> 00:24:59,470
cross that line one time the moment when

522
00:24:57,100 --> 00:25:01,330
we become the second most intelligent

523
00:24:59,470 --> 00:25:02,919
being on the planet can only happen one

524
00:25:01,330 --> 00:25:06,010
time or we can't go back

525
00:25:02,919 --> 00:25:08,200
so whenever if and whenever we're gonna

526
00:25:06,010 --> 00:25:10,690
cross that line we have to be very very

527
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:13,990
careful about how we cross the line and

528
00:25:10,690 --> 00:25:17,169
what worries me in that is that it's a

529
00:25:13,990 --> 00:25:20,289
race as there's multiple companies which

530
00:25:17,169 --> 00:25:23,889
want to be the first to create real true

531
00:25:20,289 --> 00:25:25,899
why general AI Google wants to be the

532
00:25:23,889 --> 00:25:27,580
first IBM wants to be the first Apple

533
00:25:25,899 --> 00:25:30,029
wants to be the first Microsoft wants to

534
00:25:27,580 --> 00:25:33,789
be the first and when you are in a race

535
00:25:30,029 --> 00:25:34,899
what you don't do please stop and look

536
00:25:33,789 --> 00:25:37,090
around and make sure you're doing

537
00:25:34,899 --> 00:25:41,678
everything carefully this is what

538
00:25:37,090 --> 00:25:43,689
worries me in the race to AI but like I

539
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:44,980
said we have a very clear problem on on

540
00:25:43,690 --> 00:25:48,490
definition like what do we actually mean

541
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:53,649
by this in the magazines that I read in

542
00:25:48,490 --> 00:25:55,720
1980s they were speculating that one day

543
00:25:53,649 --> 00:25:58,418
we might have a computer which would be

544
00:25:55,720 --> 00:26:01,750
so smart it would be able to beat the

545
00:25:58,419 --> 00:26:03,360
best chess player on the planet and if

546
00:26:01,750 --> 00:26:06,399
that's gonna happen well then we have

547
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:09,549
artificial intelligence well that

548
00:26:06,399 --> 00:26:11,168
happened 20 years ago and then we

549
00:26:09,549 --> 00:26:14,080
suddenly moved the goalposts then we'd

550
00:26:11,169 --> 00:26:15,909
like decided that well that's not

551
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:17,889
artificial intelligence it's just a cow

552
00:26:15,909 --> 00:26:21,610
a very powerful calculator but it's just

553
00:26:17,889 --> 00:26:25,389
a calculator so what would be a way to

554
00:26:21,610 --> 00:26:26,860
define general AI that we all would

555
00:26:25,389 --> 00:26:29,320
agree that yes that would actually be

556
00:26:26,860 --> 00:26:31,750
really intelligent just like we well how

557
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:33,730
about brain simulator simulators which

558
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:36,070
are able to simulate every single neuron

559
00:26:33,730 --> 00:26:39,220
in the human brain every single synapse

560
00:26:36,070 --> 00:26:41,230
in a human brain and there are actually

561
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:43,090
multiple project underway right now

562
00:26:41,230 --> 00:26:44,440
which are trying to do exactly that

563
00:26:43,090 --> 00:26:48,370
we are for

564
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:52,900
far away from being able to do that but

565
00:26:48,370 --> 00:26:54,820
as computing power grows every year it

566
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:57,430
might just be doable one day initially

567
00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:59,260
it could be very very slow and we were

568
00:26:57,430 --> 00:27:01,270
able to stimulate one single human brain

569
00:26:59,260 --> 00:27:03,370
in a massively large data center it's

570
00:27:01,270 --> 00:27:06,160
gonna be a million times slower than a

571
00:27:03,370 --> 00:27:07,929
real human but as you know computers get

572
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:10,690
faster eventually it's gonna be as fast

573
00:27:07,930 --> 00:27:13,600
then a million times faster than a real

574
00:27:10,690 --> 00:27:15,190
him and this would be a real human brain

575
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:17,860
which would be just like us

576
00:27:15,190 --> 00:27:21,280
without a body which would have wishes

577
00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:25,750
and hopes and dreams which would want to

578
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:28,000
work one to laugh just like we do and

579
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:29,530
that would be I think we would all agree

580
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,120
that well that would be intelligent if

581
00:27:29,530 --> 00:27:36,190
it really would be able of capable of

582
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:37,959
doing full-scale simulation and if and

583
00:27:36,190 --> 00:27:41,680
when this happens then we clearly will

584
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:44,280
have completely new ways of solving

585
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:47,350
problems including solving conflicts and

586
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:51,129
fighting fighting wars and don't take

587
00:27:47,350 --> 00:28:15,340
this from me you can take this from

588
00:27:51,130 --> 00:28:17,590
Putin let me play you a clip ever

589
00:28:15,340 --> 00:28:19,840
becomes the leader in artificial

590
00:28:17,590 --> 00:28:23,919
intelligence will become the ruler of

591
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:26,290
the world according to President Putin

592
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:27,850
and he might just be on to something

593
00:28:26,290 --> 00:28:31,899
right here

594
00:28:27,850 --> 00:28:35,500
in fact innovation in the space of

595
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:38,650
general wide a I might actually generate

596
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:42,640
more conflict okay imagine a situation

597
00:28:38,650 --> 00:28:45,250
where the country or even more

598
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:50,910
realistically a company is on the verge

599
00:28:45,250 --> 00:28:54,490
of generating real why general AI well

600
00:28:50,910 --> 00:28:56,200
the enemies of that country or enemies

601
00:28:54,490 --> 00:28:58,700
of that company will realize that if

602
00:28:56,200 --> 00:29:02,029
they succeed if they are able to

603
00:28:58,700 --> 00:29:03,889
something like that it's gonna be game

604
00:29:02,029 --> 00:29:05,419
over like we can't fight with them

605
00:29:03,889 --> 00:29:08,149
anymore we can't compete with them

606
00:29:05,419 --> 00:29:11,450
anymore they are superior we can't let

607
00:29:08,149 --> 00:29:13,549
them have that technology we must steal

608
00:29:11,450 --> 00:29:18,019
the technology or if we can't steal it

609
00:29:13,549 --> 00:29:21,259
we must destroy that technology is this

610
00:29:18,019 --> 00:29:25,580
what's gonna happen next we don't know

611
00:29:21,259 --> 00:29:28,960
but it just might and for us

612
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:32,149
security people machine learning is

613
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:34,909
routine it's an everyday occurrence we

614
00:29:32,149 --> 00:29:37,610
know the value of data because we feed

615
00:29:34,909 --> 00:29:40,070
our machine learning systems with data

616
00:29:37,610 --> 00:29:45,158
data is the new money we used to say

617
00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:45,158
that time is money today data is money

618
00:29:45,460 --> 00:29:53,870
but right now in 2019 almost all of the

619
00:29:50,029 --> 00:29:56,419
work in security space done with machine

620
00:29:53,870 --> 00:30:00,768
learning and current AI systems narrow

621
00:29:56,419 --> 00:30:02,240
AI systems is defensive I get this

622
00:30:00,769 --> 00:30:03,409
question a lot especially from

623
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:07,490
mainstream media they're asking

624
00:30:03,409 --> 00:30:09,470
questions about attackers using machine

625
00:30:07,490 --> 00:30:12,289
learning and attackers using artificial

626
00:30:09,470 --> 00:30:16,340
intelligence to create attacks and we

627
00:30:12,289 --> 00:30:17,960
aren't really seeing that yet we have

628
00:30:16,340 --> 00:30:20,860
some really narrow cases like we see

629
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:23,240
poisoning of machine learning systems

630
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:26,000
including for example spam filters

631
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:28,759
getting poisoned by by attackers who

632
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:31,190
understand how to teach them wrong by

633
00:30:28,759 --> 00:30:32,840
poisoning the data which is being fed to

634
00:30:31,190 --> 00:30:35,019
machine learning systems but that's

635
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:38,269
still pretty far away from seeing actual

636
00:30:35,019 --> 00:30:41,809
attacks which would be able to learn and

637
00:30:38,269 --> 00:30:44,509
change their behavior based on what kind

638
00:30:41,809 --> 00:30:45,500
of defenses they find attacks like that

639
00:30:44,509 --> 00:30:47,870
are doable

640
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:49,759
no question we just aren't seeing them

641
00:30:47,870 --> 00:30:52,129
yet we're seeing tons and tons of

642
00:30:49,759 --> 00:30:55,419
defensive work being done with machine

643
00:30:52,129 --> 00:31:00,469
learning we aren't seeing attacks yet

644
00:30:55,419 --> 00:31:03,139
why well my theory is that if you know

645
00:31:00,470 --> 00:31:05,240
how to program machine learning systems

646
00:31:03,139 --> 00:31:07,639
if you know how to create artificial

647
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:09,649
intelligence simulations you won't have

648
00:31:07,639 --> 00:31:12,490
any trouble finding a well-paying job

649
00:31:09,649 --> 00:31:15,559
you won't need to go into life of crime

650
00:31:12,490 --> 00:31:18,500
but this isn't going to last forever

651
00:31:15,559 --> 00:31:20,570
quite obviously today if you want to

652
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:23,059
deploy a machine learning system let's

653
00:31:20,570 --> 00:31:24,590
say implement your own fork of tender

654
00:31:23,059 --> 00:31:26,720
flow and start building something on

655
00:31:24,590 --> 00:31:30,110
that you have to be a computer science

656
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:34,160
grad in 10 years less than that in five

657
00:31:30,110 --> 00:31:36,169
years we will have such an easy way of

658
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:39,410
deploying machine learning systems that

659
00:31:36,170 --> 00:31:41,210
any idiot can use them and then they

660
00:31:39,410 --> 00:31:44,300
will and then we will start seeing

661
00:31:41,210 --> 00:31:47,600
real-world attacks cyber attacks which

662
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:50,350
will be deploying some kind of machine

663
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:54,020
learning system some kind of AI systems

664
00:31:50,350 --> 00:31:55,959
right now the lack of skill protects us

665
00:31:54,020 --> 00:32:00,110
it's not going to protect us both for

666
00:31:55,960 --> 00:32:02,290
much longer so that's an arms race as

667
00:32:00,110 --> 00:32:02,290
well

668
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:12,440
now I mentioned how deterrence has been

669
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:14,120
the key for many of the traditional

670
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:18,200
weapons nuclear weapons are the perfect

671
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:21,580
example but it also applies to basically

672
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:24,770
any kind of traditional weaponry

673
00:32:21,580 --> 00:32:30,678
aircraft carriers fighter jets bombers

674
00:32:24,770 --> 00:32:32,990
tanks we know exactly how many tanks the

675
00:32:30,679 --> 00:32:36,380
Russians have we know exactly how many

676
00:32:32,990 --> 00:32:38,950
aircraft carriers United States has we

677
00:32:36,380 --> 00:32:43,730
know exactly how many fighter jets

678
00:32:38,950 --> 00:32:45,620
Singapore has how do we know this how do

679
00:32:43,730 --> 00:32:47,690
we know how many fighter jets Singapore

680
00:32:45,620 --> 00:32:49,928
has well you just go and you google for

681
00:32:47,690 --> 00:32:49,929
it

682
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:59,450
we know the traditional power of weapons

683
00:32:56,930 --> 00:33:01,970
in in every country because they show

684
00:32:59,450 --> 00:33:06,890
them this is why we have military

685
00:33:01,970 --> 00:33:09,530
parades you show your power hoping that

686
00:33:06,890 --> 00:33:11,960
that will create a credible defense in

687
00:33:09,530 --> 00:33:14,570
the eyes of your enemies so they won't

688
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:17,830
come and attack you you show your power

689
00:33:14,570 --> 00:33:22,550
well how do you show your power in cyber

690
00:33:17,830 --> 00:33:26,419
how do you show your superior capability

691
00:33:22,550 --> 00:33:30,050
in the world of cyber how do you do a

692
00:33:26,420 --> 00:33:36,260
military parade for your cyber offensive

693
00:33:30,050 --> 00:33:40,149
skills you don't I call this the fog of

694
00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:43,580
the cyber war just like fog of war

695
00:33:40,150 --> 00:33:46,190
effects real conflict in real battle

696
00:33:43,580 --> 00:33:49,159
space fog of cyber war is our lack of

697
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:51,680
visibility into which countries and

698
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:54,320
which militaries have what kind of

699
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:58,850
capabilities like like who's best in

700
00:33:54,320 --> 00:34:00,470
offensive use of cyber power we don't

701
00:33:58,850 --> 00:34:03,379
really know we know who has most

702
00:34:00,470 --> 00:34:05,210
military capability in the real world we

703
00:34:03,380 --> 00:34:06,770
know who has the nuclear warheads we

704
00:34:05,210 --> 00:34:10,639
know who has more fighter jets than

705
00:34:06,770 --> 00:34:12,980
anyone else when it goes to cyber then

706
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:14,569
we are looking at military budgets we

707
00:34:12,980 --> 00:34:17,810
know United States has been spending

708
00:34:14,570 --> 00:34:19,310
more money in cyber over the last twenty

709
00:34:17,810 --> 00:34:20,929
years than any other country so we can

710
00:34:19,310 --> 00:34:23,389
guess that United States is very good

711
00:34:20,929 --> 00:34:25,149
and we have some kind of visibility from

712
00:34:23,389 --> 00:34:29,659
operations where they've been caught and

713
00:34:25,150 --> 00:34:33,110
some visibility from leaks we know

714
00:34:29,659 --> 00:34:36,020
Israel is very good with their offensive

715
00:34:33,110 --> 00:34:39,650
power we know Russia is very active we

716
00:34:36,020 --> 00:34:40,940
know China is probably one of the

717
00:34:39,650 --> 00:34:42,380
biggest players on the planet and

718
00:34:40,940 --> 00:34:44,929
they're only growing stronger and

719
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:48,380
stronger and then we have Iran then we

720
00:34:44,929 --> 00:34:51,259
have North Korea in fact today every

721
00:34:48,380 --> 00:34:54,670
single technically advanced nation is

722
00:34:51,260 --> 00:34:57,380
building not just defense but also often

723
00:34:54,670 --> 00:35:00,080
and we have no visibility the fog of

724
00:34:57,380 --> 00:35:03,020
cyber war prevents us from seeing what

725
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:09,920
exactly they are building

726
00:35:03,020 --> 00:35:12,290
but they are building something in some

727
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:15,310
ways cyber weapons are the perfect

728
00:35:12,290 --> 00:35:18,860
weapons cyber weapons get the job done

729
00:35:15,310 --> 00:35:23,119
they are effective they are affordable

730
00:35:18,860 --> 00:35:25,730
and they are deniable effective

731
00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:27,290
affordable deniable effective affordable

732
00:35:25,730 --> 00:35:29,980
deniable that's a pretty good

733
00:35:27,290 --> 00:35:32,480
combination of properties in a weapon

734
00:35:29,980 --> 00:35:35,630
gets the job done isn't too expensive

735
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:38,450
and you can deny that it's not your

736
00:35:35,630 --> 00:35:41,810
weapon there's very few weapons that

737
00:35:38,450 --> 00:35:43,868
have deniability cyber does have it but

738
00:35:41,810 --> 00:35:47,570
they are not without their problems

739
00:35:43,869 --> 00:35:52,300
you know cyber weapons just like

740
00:35:47,570 --> 00:35:55,880
real-world weapons wrought cyber weapons

741
00:35:52,300 --> 00:36:00,860
rot away cyber weapons have an expiry

742
00:35:55,880 --> 00:36:04,010
date imagine building some kind of an

743
00:36:00,860 --> 00:36:07,100
offensive tool kit for military use well

744
00:36:04,010 --> 00:36:09,710
it's gonna employ some kind of an attack

745
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:11,720
typically some kind of an exploit

746
00:36:09,710 --> 00:36:13,640
targeting some kind of a vulnerability

747
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:15,740
well the vulnerability has to be in a

748
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:20,180
system could be general-purpose system

749
00:36:15,740 --> 00:36:21,649
like I don't know Windows OS X iOS could

750
00:36:20,180 --> 00:36:25,210
be an application like I don't know

751
00:36:21,650 --> 00:36:30,170
Chrome Firefox Adobe PDF reader

752
00:36:25,210 --> 00:36:31,760
well these systems change the vendors

753
00:36:30,170 --> 00:36:33,859
who build these systems where the

754
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:35,690
vulnerabilities are are actively looking

755
00:36:33,859 --> 00:36:38,270
for vulnerabilities and they will patch

756
00:36:35,690 --> 00:36:40,550
them as soon as they find them the

757
00:36:38,270 --> 00:36:42,700
systems themselves get overhauled

758
00:36:40,550 --> 00:36:45,320
if you have the perfect weapon today

759
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:48,020
targeting unknown zero days in Windows

760
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:51,410
10 it's gonna work today because Windows

761
00:36:48,020 --> 00:36:52,850
10 is everywhere in five years time not

762
00:36:51,410 --> 00:36:55,210
that well in ten years time it's not

763
00:36:52,850 --> 00:37:00,830
going to work anymore it rots away and

764
00:36:55,210 --> 00:37:03,230
this is problematic when militaries

765
00:37:00,830 --> 00:37:06,410
invest large amount of money to build

766
00:37:03,230 --> 00:37:09,710
offensive cyber capability and they get

767
00:37:06,410 --> 00:37:14,868
no return for their investment through

768
00:37:09,710 --> 00:37:16,700
deterrence and the weapon rots away it

769
00:37:14,869 --> 00:37:19,190
only works for a couple of years

770
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:21,200
that almost automatically builds a

771
00:37:19,190 --> 00:37:23,829
scenario where it's more likely that

772
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:27,259
those attacks will end up getting used

773
00:37:23,829 --> 00:37:29,359
so that there's at least some return on

774
00:37:27,260 --> 00:37:32,510
the investment put into all of these

775
00:37:29,359 --> 00:37:34,369
developments no one knows you have these

776
00:37:32,510 --> 00:37:36,200
weapons they're only gonna work for a

777
00:37:34,369 --> 00:37:38,540
couple of years when they're reaching

778
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:41,598
their lifecycle reaching the end of

779
00:37:38,540 --> 00:37:44,960
their lifetime the temptation to use

780
00:37:41,599 --> 00:37:47,180
them become a speaker of course not to

781
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:49,099
you know start a war to use them but for

782
00:37:47,180 --> 00:37:50,720
example to give those weapons to

783
00:37:49,099 --> 00:37:54,589
intelligence people that hey here's

784
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:56,779
something you could use for your work we

785
00:37:54,589 --> 00:37:58,940
had no opportunity to use it in a real

786
00:37:56,780 --> 00:38:01,809
conflict but you might be able to use it

787
00:37:58,940 --> 00:38:06,140
to steal information from our enemies

788
00:38:01,809 --> 00:38:08,540
cyber weapons rot just like real-world

789
00:38:06,140 --> 00:38:10,970
weapons rot real-world weapons have

790
00:38:08,540 --> 00:38:18,950
deterrent power cyber weapons don't

791
00:38:10,970 --> 00:38:23,770
because of the fog of the cyber war now

792
00:38:18,950 --> 00:38:28,848
all these effects computers I've been a

793
00:38:23,770 --> 00:38:34,730
computer security guy all my life this

794
00:38:28,849 --> 00:38:38,059
is my 28th year working at F secure 28th

795
00:38:34,730 --> 00:38:42,319
year working as a computer security guy

796
00:38:38,059 --> 00:38:44,990
and all those years I've been thinking

797
00:38:42,319 --> 00:38:48,500
about myself as a computer security guy

798
00:38:44,990 --> 00:38:51,618
I'm a computer security guy my job is to

799
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:53,559
secure computers laptops and desktops

800
00:38:51,619 --> 00:38:56,450
and servers that's what I secure well

801
00:38:53,559 --> 00:39:00,500
today as you know everything is becoming

802
00:38:56,450 --> 00:39:03,348
a computer we are computer security

803
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:06,109
people our job is no longer to secure

804
00:39:03,349 --> 00:39:09,799
computers our job is to secure the whole

805
00:39:06,109 --> 00:39:12,619
society because our societies run on

806
00:39:09,799 --> 00:39:17,210
computers everything is becoming a

807
00:39:12,619 --> 00:39:20,180
computer yes it is the IOT revolution

808
00:39:17,210 --> 00:39:21,710
which we all know and love and hate but

809
00:39:20,180 --> 00:39:25,069
it's gonna happen whether we like it or

810
00:39:21,710 --> 00:39:27,829
not and this is not about smart devices

811
00:39:25,069 --> 00:39:29,650
it's about stupid devices smart devices

812
00:39:27,829 --> 00:39:31,880
are already on the net

813
00:39:29,650 --> 00:39:34,760
consumers who buy smart devices

814
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:37,970
understand that those devices are on the

815
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:40,040
net but very soon as it becomes cheap

816
00:39:37,970 --> 00:39:42,770
enough even stupid devices will go on

817
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:44,480
the net and the main reason why they

818
00:39:42,770 --> 00:39:47,930
will go on the net is to collect data

819
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:49,820
because data is money so they will not

820
00:39:47,930 --> 00:39:51,410
go to the Internet to give benefits to

821
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:53,420
the consumer they go to the Internet to

822
00:39:51,410 --> 00:39:56,330
give benefits to the manufacturer and

823
00:39:53,420 --> 00:39:57,290
this will apply to everything we will

824
00:39:56,330 --> 00:39:58,610
use in our homes

825
00:39:57,290 --> 00:40:00,770
everything will we'll use and our

826
00:39:58,610 --> 00:40:02,480
offices and I guess even more

827
00:40:00,770 --> 00:40:06,650
importantly everything we will use in

828
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:09,260
our infrastructure and already today

829
00:40:06,650 --> 00:40:11,900
when we look at the amount of botnets

830
00:40:09,260 --> 00:40:14,390
that we have analyzed at f-secure labs

831
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:16,610
we're seeing an ever-growing number of

832
00:40:14,390 --> 00:40:20,480
botnets which do not infect computers at

833
00:40:16,610 --> 00:40:21,680
all botnets which do not infect

834
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:24,020
computers at all

835
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:28,399
they only infect security cameras and

836
00:40:24,020 --> 00:40:32,150
Printers and coffee machines but this

837
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:34,970
revolution isn't new it really started

838
00:40:32,150 --> 00:40:37,760
from industrial control systems and

839
00:40:34,970 --> 00:40:40,250
planned automation systems and companies

840
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:43,760
like Siemens started building industrial

841
00:40:40,250 --> 00:40:48,680
control systems decades ago this isn't

842
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:52,010
new factories power plants food

843
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:54,819
processing plants any kind of industrial

844
00:40:52,010 --> 00:40:59,300
setting is being run by computers today

845
00:40:54,820 --> 00:41:03,170
and every now and then we get reminders

846
00:40:59,300 --> 00:41:06,080
of what this actually means reminders of

847
00:41:03,170 --> 00:41:08,180
what it means when factories are being

848
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:11,990
run by computers we got a very good

849
00:41:08,180 --> 00:41:15,680
reminder last week as we saw the news

850
00:41:11,990 --> 00:41:18,979
about North Kudrow getting hits in their

851
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:23,060
aluminum factories in Norway in Qatar

852
00:41:18,980 --> 00:41:24,920
and in Brazil were employees coming to

853
00:41:23,060 --> 00:41:27,410
their workplace coming to their

854
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:29,120
factories were met with notes on their

855
00:41:27,410 --> 00:41:33,230
doors about please don't turn on your

856
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:35,299
computer because we have local Goga

857
00:41:33,230 --> 00:41:38,210
going around the network and when the

858
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:39,890
news broke on last week's Monday or

859
00:41:38,210 --> 00:41:42,750
actually Tuesday morning about this

860
00:41:39,890 --> 00:41:44,970
particular incident in H

861
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:48,240
it looked really really bad especially

862
00:41:44,970 --> 00:41:49,649
because of the business this company is

863
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:53,700
in it's in the business of making

864
00:41:49,650 --> 00:41:55,530
aluminium aluminium manufacturing

865
00:41:53,700 --> 00:41:59,160
requires massive amounts of electricity

866
00:41:55,530 --> 00:42:04,190
and if the manufacturing process is

867
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:07,470
disrupted it's very fragile if your

868
00:42:04,190 --> 00:42:13,350
electrolysis pots cooled down you will

869
00:42:07,470 --> 00:42:14,850
end up with a lost factory factory that

870
00:42:13,350 --> 00:42:18,210
you can't fix that you have to rebuild

871
00:42:14,850 --> 00:42:20,339
basically and that sounds like pretty

872
00:42:18,210 --> 00:42:23,040
drastic thing well this has happened it

873
00:42:20,340 --> 00:42:25,470
actually happened earlier this month in

874
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:27,330
Venezuela not because of a cyber attack

875
00:42:25,470 --> 00:42:29,669
it happened in Venezuela because of

876
00:42:27,330 --> 00:42:31,140
extended power outages because Venezuela

877
00:42:29,670 --> 00:42:32,670
has big problems with their

878
00:42:31,140 --> 00:42:34,920
infrastructure right now but they

879
00:42:32,670 --> 00:42:36,510
actually put out an announcement earlier

880
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:39,510
this month where they said that

881
00:42:36,510 --> 00:42:42,150
Venezuela as a as a country has lost all

882
00:42:39,510 --> 00:42:43,860
capability to manufacture aluminium

883
00:42:42,150 --> 00:42:45,690
because of the power cuts they've

884
00:42:43,860 --> 00:42:48,600
experienced and they estimate is going

885
00:42:45,690 --> 00:42:52,800
to take at least a year to rebuild their

886
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:55,740
capability now as we learned more about

887
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:57,600
the attack against North could row we

888
00:42:55,740 --> 00:42:59,580
learned that it wasn't governmental it

889
00:42:57,600 --> 00:43:01,589
was money-making and we learned that

890
00:42:59,580 --> 00:43:04,850
they were able to continue operations

891
00:43:01,590 --> 00:43:08,820
they didn't lose any factories why

892
00:43:04,850 --> 00:43:11,069
because of these guys because of old

893
00:43:08,820 --> 00:43:15,300
farts in the company who still knew how

894
00:43:11,070 --> 00:43:18,380
to operate the system manually take a

895
00:43:15,300 --> 00:43:18,380
look at these binders

896
00:43:18,970 --> 00:43:25,609
these guys just earned their pension the

897
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:27,589
newcomers in the factory had no idea

898
00:43:25,610 --> 00:43:31,600
that you could actually run these plants

899
00:43:27,590 --> 00:43:36,770
without computers turns out you could

900
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:39,290
but how long can you in 20 years can we

901
00:43:36,770 --> 00:43:42,350
still do it I don't think so and the

902
00:43:39,290 --> 00:43:44,750
problem with infrastructure and plants

903
00:43:42,350 --> 00:43:47,270
is that the life cycle of the technology

904
00:43:44,750 --> 00:43:51,760
we put in these is really really long in

905
00:43:47,270 --> 00:43:51,759
some ways this affects consumers as well

906
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:57,920
when we as consumers buy technology we

907
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:59,450
don't use it for very long when you buy

908
00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:01,610
a new laptop you use it for five years

909
00:43:59,450 --> 00:44:05,419
when you buy a new smartphone you use it

910
00:44:01,610 --> 00:44:07,280
for three years something like that but

911
00:44:05,420 --> 00:44:10,660
when you buy a piece of technology which

912
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:14,180
has four wheels when you buy your car

913
00:44:10,660 --> 00:44:15,740
that's clearly technology and you expect

914
00:44:14,180 --> 00:44:17,960
to be able to use it for years and years

915
00:44:15,740 --> 00:44:21,410
and decades when you buy a new car that

916
00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:24,619
cars still gonna be on the road in 30

917
00:44:21,410 --> 00:44:26,839
years in 40 years maybe even more I'm

918
00:44:24,619 --> 00:44:30,500
driving a 19 year old car right now

919
00:44:26,840 --> 00:44:32,180
myself so I asked my followers on

920
00:44:30,500 --> 00:44:34,490
Twitter what they thought about this

921
00:44:32,180 --> 00:44:36,410
like how long do you think car company

922
00:44:34,490 --> 00:44:38,029
should provide security patches for cars

923
00:44:36,410 --> 00:44:43,069
and the consensus was that they should

924
00:44:38,030 --> 00:44:45,440
provide them for 25 years right now

925
00:44:43,070 --> 00:44:48,950
nobody's providing patches for anything

926
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:53,570
for anything like 25 years Microsoft

927
00:44:48,950 --> 00:44:57,680
provided patches for Windows XP for 10

928
00:44:53,570 --> 00:44:59,690
years something like that are we able to

929
00:44:57,680 --> 00:45:02,330
do this our car company is able to do

930
00:44:59,690 --> 00:45:06,410
these cars have become data centers on

931
00:45:02,330 --> 00:45:08,359
four wheels now I'm not saying they

932
00:45:06,410 --> 00:45:11,740
should provide security patches forever

933
00:45:08,359 --> 00:45:16,040
for free this could be a business I mean

934
00:45:11,740 --> 00:45:17,720
you you will buy new brake pads for your

935
00:45:16,040 --> 00:45:19,759
car and you pay money you don't expect

936
00:45:17,720 --> 00:45:22,430
them to provide you for free working

937
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:25,790
breaks forever for free you will you

938
00:45:22,430 --> 00:45:27,290
will pay for it I guess people would be

939
00:45:25,790 --> 00:45:28,520
ready to pay for security patches as

940
00:45:27,290 --> 00:45:30,770
well but somebody has to make them

941
00:45:28,520 --> 00:45:32,690
what's the solution here

942
00:45:30,770 --> 00:45:35,180
I don't know it could be the car

943
00:45:32,690 --> 00:45:37,880
companies when they reach the end of

944
00:45:35,180 --> 00:45:40,339
life for a particular vehicle they will

945
00:45:37,880 --> 00:45:42,140
open source it and let someone else

946
00:45:40,340 --> 00:45:44,570
figure out the security patches and make

947
00:45:42,140 --> 00:45:48,680
a maybe make a business out of that we

948
00:45:44,570 --> 00:45:50,869
don't know but everything is becoming a

949
00:45:48,680 --> 00:45:53,299
computer everything will lead patches

950
00:45:50,869 --> 00:45:55,790
and updates a friend of mine tweeted hub

951
00:45:53,300 --> 00:45:57,740
about how his car was receiving and

952
00:45:55,790 --> 00:46:01,040
over-the-air update while he was driving

953
00:45:57,740 --> 00:46:03,979
his Toyota and I don't know if you saw

954
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:06,830
the news earlier today but earlier today

955
00:46:03,980 --> 00:46:10,220
Boeing announced that now they have a

956
00:46:06,830 --> 00:46:19,220
patch for 737 max eight I wonder if that

957
00:46:10,220 --> 00:46:22,959
patch is going to be over-the-air so

958
00:46:19,220 --> 00:46:29,600
everything is becoming a computer and

959
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:31,790
this reminds me of the kinds of pipes

960
00:46:29,600 --> 00:46:35,690
we've seen around technology in the past

961
00:46:31,790 --> 00:46:39,259
which we have become to regret it might

962
00:46:35,690 --> 00:46:41,060
be a bad idea to connect everything to

963
00:46:39,260 --> 00:46:46,130
the Internet it might be a bad idea to

964
00:46:41,060 --> 00:46:48,850
turn everything into a computer let me

965
00:46:46,130 --> 00:46:48,850
play you an ad

966
00:46:59,250 --> 00:47:02,400
[Music]

967
00:47:04,420 --> 00:47:10,150
asbestos what a great innovation it

968
00:47:07,490 --> 00:47:15,229
might very well be that IO T is the IT

969
00:47:10,150 --> 00:47:17,180
asbestos couple of decades in the future

970
00:47:15,230 --> 00:47:19,610
we will look back to the mistakes we are

971
00:47:17,180 --> 00:47:21,049
doing right now as we converted

972
00:47:19,610 --> 00:47:23,210
everything into a computer and put

973
00:47:21,050 --> 00:47:26,810
everything on the Internet just 15 years

974
00:47:23,210 --> 00:47:30,020
ago the idea that we would be connecting

975
00:47:26,810 --> 00:47:31,700
our nation's infrastructure in the

976
00:47:30,020 --> 00:47:34,430
public open Internet would have been

977
00:47:31,700 --> 00:47:37,939
craziness that's exactly what we are

978
00:47:34,430 --> 00:47:42,129
doing today and we might eventually

979
00:47:37,940 --> 00:47:42,130
regret the things we are doing right now

980
00:47:43,630 --> 00:47:47,830
so when we look at the different kinds

981
00:47:45,710 --> 00:47:53,480
of governmental attacks

982
00:47:47,830 --> 00:47:58,009
it's about espionage or spying or it's

983
00:47:53,480 --> 00:48:03,980
about sabotage and fighting wars that's

984
00:47:58,010 --> 00:48:05,660
basically the options we have but the

985
00:48:03,980 --> 00:48:08,330
vast majority of governmental attacks

986
00:48:05,660 --> 00:48:11,029
are about spying and espionage now this

987
00:48:08,330 --> 00:48:14,529
is pretty obvious to see because spying

988
00:48:11,030 --> 00:48:18,550
is about collecting information

989
00:48:14,530 --> 00:48:22,160
information has become data

990
00:48:18,550 --> 00:48:25,160
traditionally spies had to go where the

991
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:30,560
information is today you don't have to

992
00:48:25,160 --> 00:48:35,029
go anywhere but we do see also sabotage

993
00:48:30,560 --> 00:48:37,130
an actual war fighting happening and

994
00:48:35,030 --> 00:48:38,780
when you're trying to defend against

995
00:48:37,130 --> 00:48:41,480
governmental attacks this is quite

996
00:48:38,780 --> 00:48:45,850
different from trying to defend against

997
00:48:41,480 --> 00:48:48,470
anything else most attackers out there

998
00:48:45,850 --> 00:48:51,080
are not governmental most attackers are

999
00:48:48,470 --> 00:48:54,379
criminals criminals are after money if

1000
00:48:51,080 --> 00:48:57,670
your organization is being targeted by a

1001
00:48:54,380 --> 00:49:00,080
criminal attacker you don't have to have

1002
00:48:57,670 --> 00:49:02,000
too good security you just have to have

1003
00:49:00,080 --> 00:49:05,299
a little bit better security than the

1004
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:07,760
other potential victims the attacker is

1005
00:49:05,300 --> 00:49:12,390
not interested in you they're interested

1006
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:14,519
in money if it's too slow too hard

1007
00:49:12,390 --> 00:49:17,640
expensive to break into your network

1008
00:49:14,519 --> 00:49:20,220
they will find an easier target they

1009
00:49:17,640 --> 00:49:23,069
will go after the low-hanging fruit and

1010
00:49:20,220 --> 00:49:27,328
let me tell you the Internet is a garden

1011
00:49:23,069 --> 00:49:30,420
of low-hanging fruit but when you're

1012
00:49:27,329 --> 00:49:32,460
fighting a governmental attacker things

1013
00:49:30,420 --> 00:49:34,680
are different they won't change their

1014
00:49:32,460 --> 00:49:35,309
mind they won't go after in easier

1015
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:38,549
target

1016
00:49:35,309 --> 00:49:40,920
why because governmental attackers are

1017
00:49:38,549 --> 00:49:43,650
typically part of a military

1018
00:49:40,920 --> 00:49:46,289
organization and they are following

1019
00:49:43,650 --> 00:49:49,260
orders they've been given an order the

1020
00:49:46,289 --> 00:49:51,829
order is go and break into that

1021
00:49:49,260 --> 00:49:56,609
organization steal that information

1022
00:49:51,829 --> 00:49:59,130
report back when you've done it go so

1023
00:49:56,609 --> 00:50:02,009
then when they are following the mission

1024
00:49:59,130 --> 00:50:03,630
and if they can't get in they're not

1025
00:50:02,010 --> 00:50:05,099
gonna change their mind like we can't

1026
00:50:03,630 --> 00:50:06,359
get in let's go and break into some

1027
00:50:05,099 --> 00:50:09,510
other random company they're not gonna

1028
00:50:06,359 --> 00:50:13,019
do that they will keep on trying until

1029
00:50:09,510 --> 00:50:16,200
they get in if they fail they'll try

1030
00:50:13,019 --> 00:50:18,808
again and again for weeks months years

1031
00:50:16,200 --> 00:50:19,950
if they can't get in any other way they

1032
00:50:18,809 --> 00:50:22,470
will eventually have one of their own

1033
00:50:19,950 --> 00:50:24,710
employees recruited inside the

1034
00:50:22,470 --> 00:50:29,299
organization they're trying to breach

1035
00:50:24,710 --> 00:50:29,299
this is a hard problem to solve

1036
00:50:30,859 --> 00:50:37,890
so almost all governmental attacks are

1037
00:50:33,660 --> 00:50:40,799
either espionage or spying or sabotage

1038
00:50:37,890 --> 00:50:42,480
or waging war with one exception and

1039
00:50:40,799 --> 00:50:44,538
that exception is North Korea North

1040
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:46,619
Korea is the only country on the planet

1041
00:50:44,539 --> 00:50:49,730
which is so bankrupt that they're

1042
00:50:46,619 --> 00:50:53,670
willing to do attacks to steal money

1043
00:50:49,730 --> 00:50:57,119
like how bankrupt do you have to be

1044
00:50:53,670 --> 00:51:00,269
where you resort to ransom Trojans to

1045
00:50:57,119 --> 00:51:04,380
fix your budget deficit but that's what

1046
00:51:00,269 --> 00:51:06,709
they're doing and not just ransom

1047
00:51:04,380 --> 00:51:10,049
Trojans we've seen plenty of attacks

1048
00:51:06,710 --> 00:51:12,359
targeting of all things Bitcoin

1049
00:51:10,049 --> 00:51:14,849
exchanges in different countries to

1050
00:51:12,359 --> 00:51:16,500
steal crypto currencies crypto

1051
00:51:14,849 --> 00:51:18,240
currencies are anonymous they're great

1052
00:51:16,500 --> 00:51:22,279
for criminals they're also great for

1053
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:24,629
bankrupt countries like North Korea and

1054
00:51:22,279 --> 00:51:26,309
when you look at this a little bit

1055
00:51:24,630 --> 00:51:27,689
deeper you realize it actually made

1056
00:51:26,309 --> 00:51:30,209
a lot of sense because the amount of

1057
00:51:27,689 --> 00:51:33,359
money being controlled by some of these

1058
00:51:30,209 --> 00:51:35,999
hacked cryptocurrency exchanges is

1059
00:51:33,359 --> 00:51:38,400
significant it's surprisingly large and

1060
00:51:35,999 --> 00:51:42,209
it's already analyzed it's already

1061
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:47,969
untrackable it's already in the shape

1062
00:51:42,209 --> 00:51:50,009
that the attackers need it this bitstamp

1063
00:51:47,969 --> 00:51:53,640
exchange from Slovenia is a great

1064
00:51:50,009 --> 00:51:57,839
example their annual training volume was

1065
00:51:53,640 --> 00:52:02,640
35 billion euros to put that into

1066
00:51:57,839 --> 00:52:04,890
perspective 35 billion euros is a

1067
00:52:02,640 --> 00:52:06,779
hundred times more than what the

1068
00:52:04,890 --> 00:52:09,479
Slovenian stock exchange is training

1069
00:52:06,779 --> 00:52:13,799
every year this is one Bitcoin exchange

1070
00:52:09,479 --> 00:52:15,989
which is basically a startup so these

1071
00:52:13,799 --> 00:52:17,880
targets are very easy compared to

1072
00:52:15,989 --> 00:52:24,329
traditional targets which would have the

1073
00:52:17,880 --> 00:52:30,420
same amount of money and governmental

1074
00:52:24,329 --> 00:52:32,789
attackers love supply chains if they can

1075
00:52:30,420 --> 00:52:34,289
gain access to supply chains they know

1076
00:52:32,789 --> 00:52:36,679
they can gain access to where they want

1077
00:52:34,289 --> 00:52:38,880
to be this is why there's so much

1078
00:52:36,679 --> 00:52:42,499
headlines about supply chain attacks

1079
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:45,809
last time we saw headlines was this week

1080
00:52:42,499 --> 00:52:48,660
we believe that the same gang which was

1081
00:52:45,809 --> 00:52:50,489
involved with the attacks we saw this

1082
00:52:48,660 --> 00:52:52,558
week might have been involved with the

1083
00:52:50,489 --> 00:52:54,959
ccleaner attack which we saw two years

1084
00:52:52,559 --> 00:52:56,699
ago another supply chain attack in fact

1085
00:52:54,959 --> 00:52:59,069
there's been surprisingly large amount

1086
00:52:56,699 --> 00:53:03,029
of governmental attacks against supply

1087
00:52:59,069 --> 00:53:04,799
chains based in Taiwan can't really

1088
00:53:03,029 --> 00:53:06,749
explain why but this plenty of

1089
00:53:04,799 --> 00:53:09,029
governmental operations from different

1090
00:53:06,749 --> 00:53:13,649
governments that have targeted supply

1091
00:53:09,029 --> 00:53:17,160
chain in taipa even Stuxnet Stuxnet

1092
00:53:13,650 --> 00:53:19,589
created by USA in Israel the binaries

1093
00:53:17,160 --> 00:53:24,319
were signed with legitimate certificates

1094
00:53:19,589 --> 00:53:27,799
stolen from two companies in Taiwan why

1095
00:53:24,319 --> 00:53:27,799
we don't really know

1096
00:53:29,780 --> 00:53:38,690
so how do you fight we speak about apts

1097
00:53:35,030 --> 00:53:41,630
and the key later in advanced persistent

1098
00:53:38,690 --> 00:53:43,820
threats is P persistence when you have a

1099
00:53:41,630 --> 00:53:47,240
persistent attacker an attacker who

1100
00:53:43,820 --> 00:53:50,690
won't give up how do you resist how do

1101
00:53:47,240 --> 00:53:54,770
you fight well there are ways of

1102
00:53:50,690 --> 00:53:56,030
fighting by using the attackers methods

1103
00:53:54,770 --> 00:53:59,090
against themselves

1104
00:53:56,030 --> 00:54:01,130
for example reputation based mechanisms

1105
00:53:59,090 --> 00:54:03,350
which don't rely on knowing anything

1106
00:54:01,130 --> 00:54:06,440
about the attacks simply look at how

1107
00:54:03,350 --> 00:54:09,259
common certain things are for example

1108
00:54:06,440 --> 00:54:13,010
when attackers create completely unique

1109
00:54:09,260 --> 00:54:15,800
new binaries new attack files hoping to

1110
00:54:13,010 --> 00:54:17,540
evade detection we can actually use that

1111
00:54:15,800 --> 00:54:21,260
to detect them

1112
00:54:17,540 --> 00:54:23,360
well how likely it is that an end-user

1113
00:54:21,260 --> 00:54:27,140
inside of your organization is going to

1114
00:54:23,360 --> 00:54:29,240
execute a program and he or she is the

1115
00:54:27,140 --> 00:54:32,569
first person on the planet to run that

1116
00:54:29,240 --> 00:54:36,140
program not very likely and when an

1117
00:54:32,570 --> 00:54:37,760
attacker is creating unique Trojans or

1118
00:54:36,140 --> 00:54:40,220
backdoors that's exactly what they're

1119
00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:42,500
doing we can use that to detect them by

1120
00:54:40,220 --> 00:54:46,069
reputation when you look at sensor based

1121
00:54:42,500 --> 00:54:49,330
technologies attackers for decades have

1122
00:54:46,070 --> 00:54:52,310
been building attacks where they first

1123
00:54:49,330 --> 00:54:54,590
download all the defense tools and test

1124
00:54:52,310 --> 00:54:58,130
whether their attack is being blocked

1125
00:54:54,590 --> 00:55:00,860
before they deploy their attacks well

1126
00:54:58,130 --> 00:55:03,320
when you build sensor based technologies

1127
00:55:00,860 --> 00:55:05,990
to block attacks the only place where

1128
00:55:03,320 --> 00:55:08,330
the attackers can test their attacks is

1129
00:55:05,990 --> 00:55:11,149
in the clients network and when they

1130
00:55:08,330 --> 00:55:13,009
test there we can see it happening and

1131
00:55:11,150 --> 00:55:15,730
this is what we should be doing we

1132
00:55:13,010 --> 00:55:19,670
should be thinking about ways to

1133
00:55:15,730 --> 00:55:22,400
counteract the mechanisms the attackers

1134
00:55:19,670 --> 00:55:26,330
are using there's no point in trying to

1135
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:28,610
play catch-up we can't defend against

1136
00:55:26,330 --> 00:55:31,910
all possible attacks because we have

1137
00:55:28,610 --> 00:55:36,610
limited imagination attackers will be

1138
00:55:31,910 --> 00:55:39,440
able to imagine an attack that you can't

1139
00:55:36,610 --> 00:55:40,570
so if you build your defenses like a

1140
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:43,650
fortress

1141
00:55:40,570 --> 00:55:45,590
you build walls around your network

1142
00:55:43,650 --> 00:55:49,590
to keep everybody out all the time

1143
00:55:45,590 --> 00:55:51,900
that's going to fail and this is what we

1144
00:55:49,590 --> 00:55:54,630
have been telling our clients and

1145
00:55:51,900 --> 00:55:56,790
customers for 20 years just build strong

1146
00:55:54,630 --> 00:55:59,340
enough walls put firewalls and proxies

1147
00:55:56,790 --> 00:56:04,230
and filters around your network nobody

1148
00:55:59,340 --> 00:56:07,890
nobody's gonna get in but what if they

1149
00:56:04,230 --> 00:56:09,750
get in anyway and they will the larger

1150
00:56:07,890 --> 00:56:13,259
your network the more likely it is they

1151
00:56:09,750 --> 00:56:15,600
will so we should assume that the

1152
00:56:13,260 --> 00:56:17,610
defenses will fail and nobody likes to

1153
00:56:15,600 --> 00:56:19,799
do that nobody likes to assume that all

1154
00:56:17,610 --> 00:56:21,990
the investment they've put around the

1155
00:56:19,800 --> 00:56:23,910
perimeter it's going to fail but that's

1156
00:56:21,990 --> 00:56:27,149
exactly what we should fail because that

1157
00:56:23,910 --> 00:56:30,000
changes the mindset from trying to

1158
00:56:27,150 --> 00:56:32,750
defend at the perimeter to looking at

1159
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:35,310
what's happening inside the network

1160
00:56:32,750 --> 00:56:37,560
which means you will be able to detect

1161
00:56:35,310 --> 00:56:41,220
the breaches faster which means you will

1162
00:56:37,560 --> 00:56:44,430
be able to respond to the breaches

1163
00:56:41,220 --> 00:56:46,379
faster and that's exactly what we should

1164
00:56:44,430 --> 00:56:49,410
be doing and that's exactly where most

1165
00:56:46,380 --> 00:56:51,620
companies are failing the most we know

1166
00:56:49,410 --> 00:56:53,910
because we run Incident Response Teams

1167
00:56:51,620 --> 00:56:55,560
those are the teams which get the phone

1168
00:56:53,910 --> 00:56:58,890
call when a company gets hacked and

1169
00:56:55,560 --> 00:57:02,070
those calls are almost always done in

1170
00:56:58,890 --> 00:57:04,980
panic oh my god we've just been hacked

1171
00:57:02,070 --> 00:57:06,810
could you come right now now be go there

1172
00:57:04,980 --> 00:57:09,540
right now now we take a look at their

1173
00:57:06,810 --> 00:57:09,960
network and we tell them and yes you're

1174
00:57:09,540 --> 00:57:12,570
right

1175
00:57:09,960 --> 00:57:14,310
you are hacked but you were hacked last

1176
00:57:12,570 --> 00:57:16,300
year

1177
00:57:14,310 --> 00:57:22,029
there's no rush here we'll come back

1178
00:57:16,300 --> 00:57:27,430
next year so we are in the middle of an

1179
00:57:22,030 --> 00:57:29,200
arms race the domains we have today are

1180
00:57:27,430 --> 00:57:35,859
not going to be the domains of the

1181
00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:38,140
future we are in an arms race and

1182
00:57:35,859 --> 00:57:40,630
everything is becoming a computer and if

1183
00:57:38,140 --> 00:57:45,160
you think yourself as a computer

1184
00:57:40,630 --> 00:57:47,770
security person it's time to expand our

1185
00:57:45,160 --> 00:57:50,890
minds we are not expanding the security

1186
00:57:47,770 --> 00:57:54,759
of our computers we should be protecting

1187
00:57:50,890 --> 00:57:55,450
the security of our societies thank you

1188
00:57:54,760 --> 00:58:06,499
very much

1189
00:57:55,450 --> 00:58:06,499
