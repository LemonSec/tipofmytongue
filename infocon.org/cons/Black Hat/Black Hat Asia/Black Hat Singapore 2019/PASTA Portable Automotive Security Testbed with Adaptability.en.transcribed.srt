1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,340
thank you for coming to my presentation

2
00:00:03,710 --> 00:00:16,010
I was afraid that because this is

3
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:22,369
rock-hard euros return presentation so

4
00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:25,230
the audience is not coming to here so

5
00:00:22,369 --> 00:00:33,140
it's very happy to see you

6
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:44,730
thank you but additional presentation

7
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:47,550
slide is added to today so may I explain

8
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:53,780
to Mary the additional presentation

9
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:58,680
material so I already solid the today I

10
00:00:53,780 --> 00:01:02,399
introduced you pasta whatever automotive

11
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:10,830
security test but with adoptability you

12
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:21,439
may already see may read paper of this

13
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:29,600
one so main update of this pasta is we

14
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:39,539
developed this logo it's a very cool so

15
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:49,490
who are we so today it's me justo am

16
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:53,610
only left side it's me so our company um

17
00:01:49,490 --> 00:01:58,640
Toyota info Technology Center the parent

18
00:01:53,610 --> 00:02:01,640
company is Toyota so Research Centre and

19
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:01,640
actually

20
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:20,050
next week my company will be disappear

21
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:24,430
very big news and we will be Tata the MC

22
00:02:20,050 --> 00:02:28,330
Toyota Motor Company itself and observed

23
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:33,970
- Toyota Motor Company's and the one of

24
00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:42,400
the division of research center so soon

25
00:02:33,970 --> 00:02:48,190
I will be a Toyota guy anyway so so some

26
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:51,580
news is on memory decorating said that

27
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:54,700
Toyota guys developed the pasta it's

28
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:56,410
wrong the data information technology

29
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:58,929
center is a different company so ah

30
00:02:56,410 --> 00:03:06,630
Toyota in technology center guides

31
00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:11,549
develop the pasta it's correct but soon

32
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:18,239
Toyota guys develop the pasta is correct

33
00:03:11,549 --> 00:03:24,340
so the first we start I set a background

34
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:29,140
so background as you know lot of the

35
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:34,680
ECU's electric control unit are in Baku

36
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:37,290
- RIA writes comfortable driving a

37
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:43,060
steering support

38
00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:48,450
breaking support stabilizing and making

39
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:53,140
a driving comfortable and the ECU's

40
00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:57,700
interact with other ECU sphere cam

41
00:03:53,140 --> 00:04:04,390
protocol uncia the sensor information

42
00:03:57,700 --> 00:04:09,988
actually and move the actuators how

43
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:12,899
about the cam protocol is very old and

44
00:04:09,989 --> 00:04:16,680
was developed with no concern about

45
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:16,680
cybersecurity attack

46
00:04:16,829 --> 00:04:24,319
and the result is that to hackers

47
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:35,960
cracked G Procera his very famous

48
00:04:29,690 --> 00:04:39,810
incident as you know they remotely

49
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:43,469
controlled the ship's wipers audio

50
00:04:39,810 --> 00:04:49,500
systems steering wheels all ran in

51
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:54,780
Calais as a result Chrysler recalled one

52
00:04:49,500 --> 00:05:01,949
point million pickles it's very it was

53
00:04:54,780 --> 00:05:02,969
very big news so it's called in Pico

54
00:05:01,949 --> 00:05:06,949
industries

55
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:06,949
it's called Christ a shock

56
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:18,979
this is systems from the problem

57
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:18,979
problems of automotive industry itself

58
00:05:20,719 --> 00:05:27,419
there is a delay in development of

59
00:05:24,349 --> 00:05:34,110
security technology in automotive

60
00:05:27,419 --> 00:05:38,609
industry also the lack of cybersecurity

61
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:46,520
engineers in automotive industry we have

62
00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:55,289
to solve solve problems that's why we

63
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:58,520
develop a pasta very big motivation here

64
00:05:55,289 --> 00:06:07,199
is a typical architecture all vehicles

65
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:11,870
now first 2010 Washington University

66
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:18,680
researchers attacked beer obd2 port

67
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:25,080
diagnostic port and directory send come

68
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:31,680
messages to easy use and controlled

69
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:38,520
but now it's memory between obd2 port

70
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:43,280
and ec user is a center of gateway some

71
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:50,039
called gateway and it works as a

72
00:06:43,280 --> 00:07:00,960
firewall so it um stop the Martius

73
00:06:50,039 --> 00:07:03,889
messages I guess and also ibi is a

74
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:07,378
navigation unit there are a lot of

75
00:07:03,889 --> 00:07:16,039
communication channels USB Bluetooth

76
00:07:07,379 --> 00:07:20,810
Wi-Fi Sarah and connect to networks so

77
00:07:16,039 --> 00:07:24,060
it is very comfortable and it's

78
00:07:20,810 --> 00:07:30,599
connected to your smartphones it's a

79
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:35,969
very you can reset your musics and

80
00:07:30,599 --> 00:07:41,490
smartphones and talk call poor vehicles

81
00:07:35,969 --> 00:07:46,069
with hands-free so it's very useful and

82
00:07:41,490 --> 00:07:48,889
comfortable but sometimes it becomes a

83
00:07:46,069 --> 00:07:56,520
very big um

84
00:07:48,889 --> 00:08:00,719
attack surfaces of course there is a the

85
00:07:56,520 --> 00:08:09,419
obd2 port and it becomes a attack

86
00:08:00,719 --> 00:08:13,680
surfaces and also I VI is becomes a

87
00:08:09,419 --> 00:08:19,049
attack surfaces USB also of course our

88
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:25,590
produce and Wi-Fi server networks the

89
00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:31,640
Chara mirrors and Chris virus X intruded

90
00:08:25,590 --> 00:08:35,569
via several networks it's very um

91
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:35,569
typical attack surfaces

92
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:51,610
in this background a lot of hackers play

93
00:08:45,130 --> 00:08:56,529
in karate bridge right Def Con in like

94
00:08:51,610 --> 00:09:02,290
DEFCON I heard that a lot of Columbia

95
00:08:56,529 --> 00:09:06,519
rage is held in a lot of countries but

96
00:09:02,290 --> 00:09:10,829
Mary I visit in the Def Con so this

97
00:09:06,519 --> 00:09:16,269
picture is I picked should n Def Con and

98
00:09:10,829 --> 00:09:17,410
the so hacking event such as CTF is very

99
00:09:16,269 --> 00:09:26,220
very fun

100
00:09:17,410 --> 00:09:32,430
I guess you joined and try to get a win

101
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:38,200
but however in my opinion is just

102
00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:44,109
cracking something not hacking it's not

103
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:46,300
creative it is thought--who that it can

104
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:53,940
be suspect way of running vehicle

105
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:53,939
security is just cracking the product

106
00:09:54,060 --> 00:10:04,739
who made by someone is not hacking

107
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:06,390
hacking must be creative it's my opinion

108
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:14,079
sorry

109
00:10:06,390 --> 00:10:18,519
so there is no harmless real call for

110
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:19,500
testers and not generalize one of course

111
00:10:18,519 --> 00:10:24,690
yes

112
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:28,240
generalized vehicle doesn't exist

113
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:32,769
generalized produces is not does not

114
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:38,250
exist so we need to develop a platform

115
00:10:32,769 --> 00:10:38,250
not only for crack but also Huck

116
00:10:40,030 --> 00:10:44,860
anyone can hug and study by background

117
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:50,290
be cool

118
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:53,560
it sounds very cool and your approval

119
00:10:50,290 --> 00:10:58,990
security technology can be very at its

120
00:10:53,560 --> 00:11:01,750
feasibility in common platform and open

121
00:10:58,990 --> 00:11:04,890
and safe and the attractive after

122
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:07,180
activity is very important for hackers

123
00:11:04,890 --> 00:11:16,660
for the equal service security is

124
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:26,500
required so now the guys here comes guys

125
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:33,760
again they gave us a hint they developed

126
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:40,410
and presented 2014 and size count

127
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:45,510
do you know size can yes or no

128
00:11:40,410 --> 00:11:53,160
anyway they presented in size young

129
00:11:45,510 --> 00:12:02,560
actually is held in here Singapore they

130
00:11:53,160 --> 00:12:07,750
modified go cut and they say that it can

131
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:12,819
be testing platform but I saw that it's

132
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:20,710
very sometimes it's very dangerous and

133
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:25,050
it's very difficult to replicate so we

134
00:12:20,710 --> 00:12:31,120
developed a pasta this one

135
00:12:25,050 --> 00:12:37,229
it's a - case sized and portable and

136
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:37,230
safe and also including in Baku networks

137
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:47,830
so the philosophy of vasta are simple

138
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:48,860
and very cool right I guess do you think

139
00:12:47,830 --> 00:12:52,850
so

140
00:12:48,860 --> 00:13:01,340
are so open and safe adaptable and

141
00:12:52,850 --> 00:13:04,690
portable open it must be open it must be

142
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:10,840
based on non proprietary technologies a

143
00:13:04,690 --> 00:13:16,310
lot of vehicle technologies are secret

144
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:21,190
so we developed first scratch which can

145
00:13:16,310 --> 00:13:23,989
be opened and adaptable

146
00:13:21,190 --> 00:13:28,310
users should be able to rewrite the farm

147
00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:32,690
we're obviously use of course you can't

148
00:13:28,310 --> 00:13:35,839
rewrite easy use for mayor of commercial

149
00:13:32,690 --> 00:13:37,460
vehicles and the redesign

150
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:41,170
you can redesign the architecture

151
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:45,340
connected their own devices for example

152
00:13:41,170 --> 00:13:51,050
this is a big difference from hacking a

153
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:55,310
cracking a part of the devices or ECU's

154
00:13:51,050 --> 00:13:59,000
you know commercial vehicles and it's

155
00:13:55,310 --> 00:14:10,540
safe because it's um the actuator is

156
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:10,540
simulated it Cowboys the incident of

157
00:14:11,590 --> 00:14:19,840
student and portable it's a very

158
00:14:17,630 --> 00:14:19,840
portable

159
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:31,670
and it makes it can be so that users can

160
00:14:26,630 --> 00:14:36,370
study research hack it anywhere but a

161
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:44,540
sorry I couldn't bring to here today

162
00:14:36,370 --> 00:14:50,060
because of the some reasons including my

163
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:54,230
company will disappear and very sorry if

164
00:14:50,060 --> 00:15:00,880
you are interested in our pasta please

165
00:14:54,230 --> 00:15:00,880
visit our offices in office in Tokyo

166
00:15:02,170 --> 00:15:13,219
so pasta is seems to be a holding area

167
00:15:09,530 --> 00:15:19,069
that's a - case but it once it opened

168
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:20,860
pasta appears very nice so it's a of

169
00:15:19,070 --> 00:15:23,990
course it's portable

170
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:33,590
mmm eight kilograms are repeat armed

171
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:39,440
with a heavy is if cock I carry it's

172
00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:45,190
like this portable and also the simple

173
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:49,580
simulator is embedded in a passage

174
00:15:45,190 --> 00:15:53,210
simple simulator and it can be operated

175
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:55,850
with a physical controller mmm

176
00:15:53,210 --> 00:16:01,990
you can see can you see a physical

177
00:15:55,850 --> 00:16:01,990
controls in here around here

178
00:16:10,210 --> 00:16:19,320
after that I can show the videos and we

179
00:16:19,410 --> 00:16:29,230
equipped some tax offices which is very

180
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:33,279
typical since we are easy to simulate a

181
00:16:29,230 --> 00:16:38,620
cam message injection security variation

182
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:43,600
it's easy you can modify the program all

183
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:49,410
these easy use in sere language and the

184
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:56,080
attack surfaces are obd2 clipping area

185
00:16:49,410 --> 00:17:01,750
physically clipping injection box I no

186
00:16:56,080 --> 00:17:07,179
need to shoot a picture you can download

187
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:14,490
this material of Roma github please

188
00:17:07,179 --> 00:17:14,490
concentrate my presentation listen to me

189
00:17:15,990 --> 00:17:25,359
so next information pro imposters um

190
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:28,329
maybe it's video the - case controller

191
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:31,469
is controller speak with simulators are

192
00:17:28,329 --> 00:17:34,980
integrated and also the physical

193
00:17:31,470 --> 00:17:38,679
physically you are correct console and

194
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:43,090
controller under send a message to easy

195
00:17:38,679 --> 00:17:49,200
use each easy use and receive the

196
00:17:43,090 --> 00:17:54,610
message of controls is you hydrate and

197
00:17:49,200 --> 00:18:02,140
they send some messages to share the

198
00:17:54,610 --> 00:18:06,719
information beer some messages and they

199
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:13,690
is you control object of feedback

200
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:18,750
according to received camp messages so

201
00:18:13,690 --> 00:18:23,370
if um for example if are you sphere

202
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:28,290
steering wheel turn right down them

203
00:18:23,370 --> 00:18:35,090
the control control message is going to

204
00:18:28,290 --> 00:18:39,720
easy use and share the degree and then

205
00:18:35,090 --> 00:18:45,990
they the ECU send cam messages

206
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:55,560
share the information and then the body

207
00:18:45,990 --> 00:19:02,370
or tires going to right so yes so inside

208
00:18:55,560 --> 00:19:10,879
of ECU is like this of course it's very

209
00:19:02,370 --> 00:19:16,409
it's open and design is also open is in

210
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:25,430
github you can download and check it and

211
00:19:16,410 --> 00:19:29,970
also can ID table is opened most of all

212
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:38,880
vehicle companies make it secret

213
00:19:29,970 --> 00:19:44,630
the Canada table but in pasta we can it

214
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:48,710
make it open because we designed itself

215
00:19:44,630 --> 00:19:56,060
ourselves for pasta

216
00:19:48,710 --> 00:20:04,290
so that can ideas of this one is

217
00:19:56,060 --> 00:20:09,540
different from real ones but you can

218
00:20:04,290 --> 00:20:15,960
create your own table this is very

219
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:17,870
important the news again attack reading

220
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:22,950
say that Oh

221
00:20:17,870 --> 00:20:30,479
Toyota opened their can ideal tables

222
00:20:22,950 --> 00:20:34,920
it's wrong pastas channel ie table will

223
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:38,890
be opened and we opened

224
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:44,280
it's completely different it's not real

225
00:20:38,890 --> 00:20:55,180
thing it's not upright in real vehicles

226
00:20:44,280 --> 00:21:01,780
and we hope that the can ID tables under

227
00:20:55,180 --> 00:21:09,210
the the loose is I guess it's not

228
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:17,580
perfect because it's developed by

229
00:21:09,210 --> 00:21:25,590
engineers who do not know security so

230
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:36,480
Harker's who knows the security design

231
00:21:25,590 --> 00:21:43,000
they can tidy tables it's I believe that

232
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:50,620
by design security by design so I hope

233
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:56,200
that this the example of an ID table

234
00:21:50,620 --> 00:22:02,459
will be spread and you can design can ID

235
00:21:56,200 --> 00:22:09,640
tables it's completely different from

236
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:16,990
Toyota open channel D tables please

237
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:23,940
understand that my real opinion that is

238
00:22:16,990 --> 00:22:29,860
this is very very different from city F

239
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:38,350
which is searching for what can tidy is

240
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:42,699
means means the problems the CDF's is

241
00:22:38,350 --> 00:22:49,049
just only analyzing that care what the

242
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:54,480
can ID means this is not it's not create

243
00:22:49,049 --> 00:23:03,850
creative creative is you can design

244
00:22:54,480 --> 00:23:14,399
Canada table that's why I doubt that CDF

245
00:23:03,850 --> 00:23:14,399
is really good way to run why not

246
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:30,400
I'm sorry for our city year for us CTF

247
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:35,550
itself is very fun and also very useful

248
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:39,270
I believe so but um I will try to say

249
00:23:35,550 --> 00:23:39,270
different viewpoint

250
00:23:39,870 --> 00:23:44,969
so you can download a github

251
00:23:45,210 --> 00:23:58,300
specification from the github I rolled

252
00:23:49,420 --> 00:24:02,890
it a few days ago please visit pasta

253
00:23:58,300 --> 00:24:08,879
owed and click the talk and you can

254
00:24:02,890 --> 00:24:10,210
download an ID list from here so back to

255
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:16,080
inside of

256
00:24:10,210 --> 00:24:16,080
ECU's can I have a time do I have time

257
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:27,129
ok inside obviously use um there are a

258
00:24:22,030 --> 00:24:33,270
two three to C port and jtag port via

259
00:24:27,130 --> 00:24:37,660
this port you can approach the Europe

260
00:24:33,270 --> 00:24:44,679
binaries of course you get a binary from

261
00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:48,400
here based on microcontroller rx which

262
00:24:44,679 --> 00:24:52,720
is by rancis we have designed interrupt

263
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:54,970
I see you from scratch if you prepare

264
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:57,600
for develop environment influences

265
00:24:54,970 --> 00:25:00,760
microcontroller you can pry your own

266
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:07,379
program in sign language is about very

267
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:13,059
adaptable so I'll direct to show de

268
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:18,390
adaptability of pasta is the whole image

269
00:25:13,059 --> 00:25:18,389
of now we prepare for the pasta the

270
00:25:20,550 --> 00:25:30,840
center is the - case of pasta so pasta

271
00:25:28,179 --> 00:25:33,990
can connect to the physical inputs and

272
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:35,649
also connect a scale model of equals

273
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:42,850
those who connect

274
00:25:35,650 --> 00:25:51,220
because simulator so demonstration of

275
00:25:42,850 --> 00:25:53,649
adaptability past objects to show the

276
00:25:51,220 --> 00:26:04,630
connection of pasta and the scale model

277
00:25:53,650 --> 00:26:13,380
vehicle here is the connection of pasta

278
00:26:04,630 --> 00:26:13,380
and in each your vehicle first power on

279
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:34,480
and then ignition like real vehicle if

280
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:39,460
you arm break up the braking is hundred

281
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:44,799
percent so shift position you can change

282
00:26:39,460 --> 00:26:48,240
the positions actually does mean mean

283
00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:48,240
jerk camera haha

284
00:26:48,309 --> 00:27:02,860
ninja big who has a mean Jack camera so

285
00:26:51,070 --> 00:27:09,428
it works in shift position some right

286
00:27:02,860 --> 00:27:15,279
are right the Brinks has a trice and you

287
00:27:09,429 --> 00:27:24,450
can see steering is going to the right

288
00:27:15,279 --> 00:27:29,380
and also going to left according to the

289
00:27:24,450 --> 00:27:38,320
the controls or pasta the controller

290
00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:42,700
message is send pastas and media vehicle

291
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:46,260
beer Brutus the simulation simulator

292
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:53,020
situation status is

293
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:53,740
sent to me a vehicle and received me a

294
00:27:53,020 --> 00:27:56,550
vehicle

295
00:27:53,740 --> 00:28:10,350
ah when you should wipe as also moves

296
00:27:56,550 --> 00:28:17,020
the speed speeding up and speeding slow

297
00:28:10,350 --> 00:28:21,040
speeded that down it's very um tiny but

298
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:28,389
it works very leo because it's made in

299
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:32,290
Japan of course our washer doesn't work

300
00:28:28,390 --> 00:28:36,330
because if the washer works um the major

301
00:28:32,290 --> 00:28:36,330
vehicle will be broken

302
00:28:50,650 --> 00:28:53,729
[Music]

303
00:28:54,970 --> 00:29:04,000
so it's a bit um wrong so the skin so

304
00:29:05,559 --> 00:29:21,370
when accelerator is 100% it comes the

305
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:25,279
speed is very fast but my ass is not 199

306
00:29:21,370 --> 00:29:33,139
geometry power because there is no

307
00:29:25,279 --> 00:29:42,500
feedback from vehicles so it's very it's

308
00:29:33,140 --> 00:29:46,820
not so real so we saw that to make it

309
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:54,850
more real integration of driving

310
00:29:46,820 --> 00:30:02,779
simulator with pasta this is um so okay

311
00:29:54,850 --> 00:30:08,209
so connection of our yoga ku is a sorry

312
00:30:02,779 --> 00:30:12,350
there on the ride is um make it a lot um

313
00:30:08,210 --> 00:30:15,320
physical inputs and pasta and software

314
00:30:12,350 --> 00:30:17,649
because simulator not scale model

315
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:17,649
vehicle

316
00:30:25,230 --> 00:30:31,639
here is a home driving simulator and

317
00:30:29,070 --> 00:30:31,639
connection

318
00:30:43,570 --> 00:30:49,470
now if the behavior is very smooth

319
00:30:52,109 --> 00:31:01,499
physical our controller send the

320
00:30:57,190 --> 00:31:07,090
controller message to pasta and send

321
00:31:01,499 --> 00:31:14,729
pasta centric a message to simulators

322
00:31:07,090 --> 00:31:18,639
unsimilar sent back feedback to pasta so

323
00:31:14,729 --> 00:31:23,229
it's completely different from control

324
00:31:18,639 --> 00:31:27,758
is directly connected to simulator this

325
00:31:23,229 --> 00:31:35,909
simulator is controlled via

326
00:31:27,759 --> 00:31:39,809
cam so speeding up is very unnatural

327
00:31:35,909 --> 00:31:39,809
natural natural

328
00:31:47,230 --> 00:31:59,000
so it becomes natural we can show that

329
00:31:53,620 --> 00:32:03,379
of course the incident replicate

330
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:05,590
incident before the instant

331
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:11,440
demonstration we have to say that

332
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:11,439
spraying the demonstration the cushion

333
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:22,820
next demonstration is send a message

334
00:32:15,710 --> 00:32:29,920
from obd2 port emerges messages from via

335
00:32:22,820 --> 00:32:35,379
from obj do port and also there is no

336
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:41,930
security systems in pasta

337
00:32:35,380 --> 00:32:47,000
there is no filters in ECU's and also

338
00:32:41,930 --> 00:32:54,940
safe no safety functions in ECU's so

339
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:54,940
it's very easy to manipulate and control

340
00:32:55,000 --> 00:33:02,630
the pickles so it's different from real

341
00:33:00,170 --> 00:33:08,260
vehicle real vehicles hacking is not

342
00:33:02,630 --> 00:33:15,280
much more difficult and also this is not

343
00:33:08,260 --> 00:33:20,629
the other vehicle I believe so

344
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:23,139
demonstration of instant attacking a

345
00:33:20,630 --> 00:33:23,140
steering wheel

346
00:33:23,330 --> 00:33:31,550
right side of the husband is Atticus PC

347
00:33:28,410 --> 00:33:31,550
this video encoding

348
00:33:41,850 --> 00:33:45,080
like uh species

349
00:33:55,010 --> 00:34:10,980
please see right here the UM the drivers

350
00:34:05,190 --> 00:34:12,270
hands off but the steering tires going

351
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:15,320
to right again

352
00:34:12,270 --> 00:34:15,320
preciate it

353
00:34:35,159 --> 00:34:42,470
ah this is easy replication

354
00:34:42,589 --> 00:34:53,690
okay so untrust

355
00:34:46,879 --> 00:35:01,049
we um present some use cases or pasa of

356
00:34:53,690 --> 00:35:09,180
course it's very easy to for educational

357
00:35:01,049 --> 00:35:13,490
use Rio campus and typical attack

358
00:35:09,180 --> 00:35:21,558
surfaces will help beginners to learn

359
00:35:13,490 --> 00:35:27,078
vehicle security the cow is reading a

360
00:35:21,559 --> 00:35:31,849
caucus handbook and also the right guy

361
00:35:27,079 --> 00:35:35,970
nice guys right side is programming and

362
00:35:31,849 --> 00:35:42,930
sending a message to a pasta it's very

363
00:35:35,970 --> 00:35:46,669
easy way to an education of pico

364
00:35:42,930 --> 00:35:53,069
cybersecurity and also it's very

365
00:35:46,670 --> 00:35:59,059
uncomfortable they can hug inside of

366
00:35:53,069 --> 00:35:59,058
loon and more

367
00:36:02,370 --> 00:36:22,000
ZDF you know a lot of guys can hug the

368
00:36:10,450 --> 00:36:29,049
pasta it can be it's a one example of

369
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:32,260
use case of pasta and also research and

370
00:36:29,050 --> 00:36:35,940
development many kinds of securities

371
00:36:32,260 --> 00:36:39,450
techniques can be applied to pasta and

372
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:43,780
it works as a common platform security

373
00:36:39,450 --> 00:36:47,379
variation and security techniques which

374
00:36:43,780 --> 00:36:55,150
is developed by vendors our researchers

375
00:36:47,380 --> 00:37:00,400
can be evaluated on pasta so if you the

376
00:36:55,150 --> 00:37:05,970
researchers upload the security systems

377
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:10,800
in website or somewhere and write to

378
00:37:05,970 --> 00:37:17,339
common platform this pasta and you can

379
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:21,160
anyone can evaluate the security it's

380
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:32,790
the security systems is techniques is

381
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:38,640
secure one not you cannot find it on the

382
00:37:32,790 --> 00:37:46,290
binary our roadmap for more advanced and

383
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:52,440
realistic architecture there are more

384
00:37:46,290 --> 00:37:59,320
protocols in vehicles such as Rincon FD

385
00:37:52,440 --> 00:38:04,770
Ethernet and so on so we have to support

386
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:13,000
pasta have to support these protocols

387
00:38:04,770 --> 00:38:15,640
and also path is now only support can

388
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:22,080
messages canvas is

389
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:22,080
can protocols so there is no such an

390
00:38:23,130 --> 00:38:34,660
navigation systems or much media unit so

391
00:38:30,090 --> 00:38:42,190
support wireless interfaces needed like

392
00:38:34,660 --> 00:38:48,730
a Wi-Fi Brutus and Sarah's and now pasta

393
00:38:42,190 --> 00:38:52,750
has only three domains in now currently

394
00:38:48,730 --> 00:38:56,860
the new vehicles current vehicles have

395
00:38:52,750 --> 00:39:08,200
much more complicated and much more

396
00:38:56,860 --> 00:39:15,520
domains so we plan to make more real

397
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:18,700
race more complicated architecture and

398
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:25,600
support other systems is something like

399
00:39:18,700 --> 00:39:32,520
Oasis and this is an additional so open

400
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:38,500
the source code on github we uploaded

401
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:42,700
ours materials and the features in to

402
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:46,480
github a few days ago we in time this

403
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:52,710
rock hard idea but um the source code is

404
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:59,530
not not yet uploaded so we will upload

405
00:39:52,710 --> 00:40:01,960
preparing for that so take away in spite

406
00:39:59,530 --> 00:40:04,540
of equal security importance importance

407
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:07,380
any complete form for research are not

408
00:40:04,540 --> 00:40:13,990
being developed

409
00:40:07,380 --> 00:40:18,220
pasta is can be a platform so pasta is

410
00:40:13,990 --> 00:40:25,299
open and safe adaptable and portable arm

411
00:40:18,220 --> 00:40:29,020
is very right and small apparently

412
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:31,090
portable the design of pasta is open

413
00:40:29,020 --> 00:40:35,380
and anyone can program the program

414
00:40:31,090 --> 00:40:38,650
unchanged the ECU's behavior and past

415
00:40:35,380 --> 00:40:43,690
item res for students or researchers

416
00:40:38,650 --> 00:40:49,350
hackers so because actually it has a

417
00:40:43,690 --> 00:40:54,510
similar editing software so we hope that

418
00:40:49,350 --> 00:40:58,118
pasta will be a common platform for

419
00:40:54,510 --> 00:41:02,250
educational tools automotive service

420
00:40:58,119 --> 00:41:02,250
security research different governments

421
00:41:03,150 --> 00:41:14,680
for more information please contact

422
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:21,240
twitter github and made this email will

423
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:24,640
be expired in by the end of april so

424
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:30,660
because of our company with disappears

425
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:38,618
again so we will upload a new contact

426
00:41:30,660 --> 00:41:41,859
mail address in github and Twitter so if

427
00:41:38,619 --> 00:41:51,720
you interested in pasta please contact

428
00:41:41,859 --> 00:41:57,250
from somewhere so before the Q and a

429
00:41:51,720 --> 00:42:01,750
frequently asked questions FAQ we had a

430
00:41:57,250 --> 00:42:06,600
lot of males a tons of thousand makers

431
00:42:01,750 --> 00:42:11,010
from all over the world after the

432
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:25,270
presentation of bracket euro thank you

433
00:42:11,010 --> 00:42:28,650
so our most frequent question is how

434
00:42:25,270 --> 00:42:28,650
much is pasta

435
00:42:31,220 --> 00:42:46,529
now we discuss some guys who will come

436
00:42:41,870 --> 00:42:50,240
in Toyota to sell the to sell this

437
00:42:46,530 --> 00:42:53,040
product in this current situation

438
00:42:50,240 --> 00:43:01,680
concern occurred in the situation it

439
00:42:53,040 --> 00:43:10,890
becomes the price which will be similar

440
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:14,759
to actual car and next frequent question

441
00:43:10,890 --> 00:43:18,600
is when can I buy pasta sorry I don't

442
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:22,260
know we are planning to start stirring

443
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:32,660
in Japan fast and it plans to sell it to

444
00:43:22,260 --> 00:43:32,660
other countries afterwards but we now

445
00:43:34,010 --> 00:43:51,270
plan to sell in Japan this summer it may

446
00:43:46,890 --> 00:43:54,290
be and why the specification of pasta is

447
00:43:51,270 --> 00:43:54,290
not open yet

448
00:43:55,620 --> 00:44:07,759
we uploaded the specification pasta a

449
00:44:00,980 --> 00:44:13,980
few days ago so please do not any

450
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:15,630
discussion to us by email sorry for rate

451
00:44:13,980 --> 00:44:17,480
additional resource code and the

452
00:44:15,630 --> 00:44:25,940
detailed information will be a product

453
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:25,940
soon so Christians thank you

454
00:44:49,990 --> 00:45:04,479
um my company will go to very near to

455
00:44:58,430 --> 00:45:08,509
ultimate there near to Tokyo Station so

456
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:12,250
please come to Tokyo Station and buy

457
00:45:08,510 --> 00:45:32,420
walk to come to all the mass building

458
00:45:12,250 --> 00:45:43,450
six floor there is our company not

459
00:45:32,420 --> 00:45:43,450
