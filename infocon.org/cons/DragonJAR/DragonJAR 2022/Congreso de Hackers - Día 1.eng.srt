the lines of business that ended

184
00:21:56,019 --> 00:21:57,339
to comment on the subject of education

185
00:21:57,339 --> 00:21:59,289
online we basically teach people

186
00:21:59,289 --> 00:22:01,989
people to audit systems

187
00:22:01,989 --> 00:22:04,569
information another other of the lines is

188
00:22:04,569 --> 00:22:06,219
as such provide security services

189
00:22:06,219 --> 00:22:08,759
computing basically us

190
00:22:08,759 --> 00:22:11,229
we compromise IT assets

191
00:22:11,229 --> 00:22:13,419
of an organization as it could

192
00:22:13,419 --> 00:22:16,029
perform a computer criminal but

193
00:22:16,029 --> 00:22:18,370
with the purpose of our main

194
00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:21,010
purpose is for customers to know

195
00:22:21,010 --> 00:22:23,050
what are your security issues and

196
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:24,850
they can correct us basically

197
00:22:24,850 --> 00:22:27,100
we activate people's software

198
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:28,900
infrastructure of people and

199
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:30,520
we say see these are the tests

200
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:32,200
you have so that you can

201
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:34,590
sort out

types of hacker conferences is very

220
00:26:48,679 --> 00:26:50,139
important so that

we have more knowledge of how

222
00:26:52,399 --> 00:26:56,090

someone made this topic a long time ago

264
00:28:44,550 --> 00:28:46,920
time the truth did not come to manizales

265
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:49,830
minutes several years ago tests that

266
00:28:49,830 --> 00:28:54,300
I came in five years later in 2009 and

267
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:57,240
ago and kraft with the permission of manizales has

268
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:58,470
grown a lot

269
00:28:58,470 --> 00:29:01,700
second initiation move too

270
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:04,880

I am very happy because it feels like

273
00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:13,639
there is let's say that more participation

274
00:29:13,639 --> 00:29:14,840
important is to generate more

275
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:17,620
consciousness coincidence as to

276
00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:22,870
to make sure or to be insecure and

277
00:29:22,870 --> 00:29:26,440
to be able to ensure

278
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:30,799

the servers of the bad hackers and what

284
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:43,880
let's find where they are at

285
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:46,059
internet and sometimes we can

286
00:29:46,059 --> 00:29:48,769
disable and well is what comes

287
00:29:48,769 --> 00:29:51,019

impact of these exploits and how

307
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:38,350
work so that people can

308
00:30:38,350 --> 00:30:40,990
understand like this

309
00:30:40,990 --> 00:30:43,480
may be vulnerable not only

310
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:45,940
users but also companies and what

311
00:30:45,940 --> 00:30:48,790
measures can be taken to avoid falling into

312
00:30:48,790 --> 00:30:51,970
these things that maybe they can bring

313

00:35:59,770 --> 00:36:02,140
types of hacker conferences is very

354
00:36:02,140 --> 00:36:04,810
important for us to have more

355
00:36:04,810 --> 00:36:06,760
knowledge of how they are

356
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:09,880
making hackers to penetrate her

357
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:12,820
schemes and type of social engineering that

358
00:36:12,820 --> 00:36:14,770
are doing to be able to teach the

359
00:36:14,770 --> 00:36:16,990
students how how to defend yourself buy

360

unexpected talk and throw it cover

375
00:36:59,410 --> 00:37:02,680
besides that it has been missing so we wait

376

Josefina is just a security investment

383
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:17,180
computing

384
00:37:17,180 --> 00:37:19,550
It has been internationally I am also

385
00:37:19,550 --> 00:37:22,010
event sponsor for any

386
00:37:22,010 --> 00:37:25,460
silly because basically space has

387
00:37:25,460 --> 00:37:28,280
been great really was what me

388
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:31,940
always expected all managers and

389
00:37:31,940 --> 00:37:34,520
Well, the dragon with has always been a

390
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:37,430
Colombian showcase for people

391
00:37:37,430 --> 00:37:39,640
talented in computer security

392
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:42,980
both Latin American and local and

393
00:37:42,980 --> 00:37:46,609
Well, I invited you to a next one

394
00:37:46,609 --> 00:37:48,680

395
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:50,900

am

398
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:58,010
Someone admit that this topic is long overdue

399
00:37:58,010 --> 00:38:00,349
time the truth did not come to manizales

400
00:38:00,349 --> 00:38:03,829
several years now that they come to the

401
00:38:03,829 --> 00:38:06,760
mind five later in 2009

402
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:09,680
and ago and I think it's falcon avenue

403
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:11,900
humanizing has grown a lot

404
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:13,849
we give it life and make a decision security

405
00:38:13,849 --> 00:38:15,140
too

406
00:38:15,140 --> 00:38:18,380
the event has grown into university of

407
00:38:18,380 --> 00:38:20,860
made of power

408
00:38:21,140 --> 00:38:23,390
I am very happy because it feels like

409
00:38:23,390 --> 00:38:27,079
there is let's say that more participation

410
00:38:27,079 --> 00:38:28,279
important is to generate more

411
00:38:28,279 --> 00:38:31,480
awareness more coincidence as to

412
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:36,339
safe to be insecure and

413
00:38:36,339 --> 00:38:40,390
to be able to ensure

414
00:38:41,079 --> 00:38:44,480
marten well I'm Mexican I don't come from

415
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:46,730
switzerland i work for dream la technologies

416
00:38:46,730 --> 00:38:49,670
in Switzerland and comes to present a talk

417
00:38:49,670 --> 00:38:51,559
which is called rats sporting and basically

418
00:38:51,559 --> 00:38:54,079
let's find the servers

419
00:38:54,079 --> 00:38:56,539
bad hackers and we will find it

420
00:38:56,539 --> 00:38:58,789
where they are on the internet and in some

421
00:38:58,789 --> 00:39:01,609
sometimes we can disable them and good

422
00:39:01,609 --> 00:39:03,470
It's what's coming, he's having a great time

423

424
00:39:06,230 --> 00:39:09,730
dragon is already an event that has already

425
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:12,500
a reputation the community already has

426
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:17,230
many years my red name is knox

427
00:39:17,230 --> 00:39:19,670

Buenos Aires this conference of

429
00:39:22,780 --> 00:39:25,370
2015 of my fourth time I'm coming

430
00:39:25,370 --> 00:39:27,410
so the truth is that I have a love

431
00:39:27,410 --> 00:39:29,600
especially for the

432
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:31,550
knowledge of its parts and talk

433
00:39:31,550 --> 00:39:33,110
specifically talk about issues of

434
00:39:33,110 --> 00:39:35,210
exploitation of vulnerabilities in wii

435
00:39:35,210 --> 00:39:39,020
in windows and how were all found

436
00:39:39,020 --> 00:39:42,020
those vulnerabilities inta wild and how

437
00:39:42,020 --> 00:39:45,860
we with force I was able to do the

438
00:39:45,860 --> 00:39:48,110
exploits and tell a little what is the

439
00:39:48,110 --> 00:39:49,970
impact of these exploits and how

440
00:39:49,970 --> 00:39:51,740
work so that people can

441
00:39:51,740 --> 00:39:54,440
understand like this

442
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:56,930
may be vulnerable not only

443
00:39:56,930 --> 00:39:59,390
users but also companies and what

444
00:39:59,390 --> 00:40:02,240
measures can be taken to avoid falling into

445
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:05,420
these things that maybe they can bring

446
00:40:05,420 --> 00:40:09,670
economic and business damage

further develop security

475
00:41:11,990 --> 00:41:13,910

these three days full of knowledge

480
00:41:23,090 --> 00:41:24,980
which are called dragonheart security

481
00:41:24,980 --> 00:41:27,140
company is our jaques congress

482
00:41:27,140 --> 00:41:30,619
annual that today we have reached more than

483
00:41:30,619 --> 00:41:33,830
let's say nine uninterrupted editions

484
00:41:33,830 --> 00:41:36,890
and nine editions next year to do

485
00:41:36,890 --> 00:41:39,170
Ten issues and we're gonna get some

486
00:41:39,170 --> 00:41:42,210
very cool for you

487
00:41:42,210 --> 00:41:44,810
today's idea is before

488
00:41:44,810 --> 00:41:47,310
wait for the main content

489
00:41:47,310 --> 00:41:49,230
obviously it's the first cell of the day

490
00:41:49,230 --> 00:41:51,480
with Pablo González in Spanish that is

491
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:53,369
known to many of you and that is

492
00:41:53,369 --> 00:41:55,020
a true reference on the subject of

493
00:41:55,020 --> 00:41:57,450
computer security is to give them some

494
00:41:57,450 --> 00:42:00,869
few instructions for us to remove the

495
00:42:00,869 --> 00:42:03,619
make the most of this great event

496
00:42:03,619 --> 00:42:06,530
so what we are going to do is see

497
00:42:06,530 --> 00:42:08,730
some recommendations that overwhelmed them

498
00:42:08,730 --> 00:42:11,070
so that we can make the most of the

499
00:42:11,070 --> 00:42:13,859
congress hope you all enjoy this

500
00:42:13,859 --> 00:42:15,030
just as we are enjoying it

501
00:42:15,030 --> 00:42:17,580
doing so they know that we

502
00:42:17,580 --> 00:42:19,830
we owe by and for the community and by

503
00:42:19,830 --> 00:42:21,839
that is that we have these spaces and

504
00:42:21,839 --> 00:42:23,580
we'll try to hold on for long

505
00:42:23,580 --> 00:42:25,319
more time

506
00:42:25,319 --> 00:42:27,509
to confirm then we are already in

507
00:42:27,509 --> 00:42:30,079
screen

508
00:43:12,130 --> 00:43:16,720
number 10 we are going to have in the city

509
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:18,970
from manizales our return to the

510
00:43:18,970 --> 00:43:21,910
entrance presence I confirm

511
00:43:21,910 --> 00:43:24,130
which will be the month of September

512
00:43:24,130 --> 00:43:25,930
next year we have not yet defined the

513
00:43:25,930 --> 00:43:28,150
dates but I also confirm that

514
00:43:28,150 --> 00:43:30,130
Although we are not very clear, we are at

515
00:43:30,130 --> 00:43:31,960
have a paid entry what yes

516
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:34,270
We are clear that this entire community

517
00:43:34,270 --> 00:43:36,210
that has been created around the

518
00:43:36,210 --> 00:43:38,910
possibility of having a space

519
00:43:38,910 --> 00:43:41,440
face-to-face and an online space, well, no.

520
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:43,480
we are going to lose it therefore we are going to

521
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:44,950
keep a balance and let's

522
00:43:44,950 --> 00:43:47,290
keep independent

523
00:43:47,290 --> 00:43:49,360
payment entry we will not keep the

524
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:51,370
free stress so that all this

525
00:43:51,370 --> 00:43:54,070
access bridge to the event and all this

526
00:43:54,070 --> 00:43:55,690
content that we have been generated with the

527
00:43:55,690 --> 00:43:57,730
time already nine years and next year

528
00:43:57,730 --> 00:44:00,550
there will be ten and in this way they can

529
00:44:00,550 --> 00:44:02,800
keep taking advantage of everything you have

530
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:06,360
dunk community for you

531
00:44:08,690 --> 00:44:12,200
the fact is that this version is going to be

532
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:15,829
100% online and we are going to need the

533
00:44:15,829 --> 00:44:17,839
your support because I tell you this

534
00:44:17,839 --> 00:44:20,000
why are you so tired of

535
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:23,329
give forgiveness to listen to lectures

536
00:44:23,329 --> 00:44:25,310
online as our speakers too

537
00:44:25,310 --> 00:44:30,299
they are tired of not feeling

538
00:44:30,299 --> 00:44:32,819
Let's say that human warmth that is usually

539
00:44:32,819 --> 00:44:35,609
feel in face-to-face conferences

540
00:44:35,609 --> 00:44:37,619
that's why we need all the support

541
00:44:37,619 --> 00:44:39,869
from you

542
00:44:39,869 --> 00:44:42,089
and we go in all that energy and that

543
00:44:42,089 --> 00:44:44,999
we can give you a lot of virtual love for

544
00:44:44,999 --> 00:44:46,829
say it somehow to all our

545
00:44:46,829 --> 00:44:48,869
talks to all our content to all

546
00:44:48,869 --> 00:44:51,329
what we are doing for and for

547
00:44:51,329 --> 00:44:54,089
How are we going to do it, well, very

548
00:44:54,089 --> 00:44:56,430
easy this year like every year

549
00:44:56,430 --> 00:44:58,740
we have the hashtag for all networks

550
00:44:58,740 --> 00:45:01,259
social script stretches ar with this is the

551
00:45:01,259 --> 00:45:03,180
simplest way that you have of

552
00:45:03,180 --> 00:45:05,339
thank the speakers in our

553
00:45:05,339 --> 00:45:06,630
main page is online

554
00:45:06,630 --> 00:45:08,279
of each one of them and

555
00:45:08,279 --> 00:45:10,230
It seems very interesting what they have said

556
00:45:10,230 --> 00:45:12,119
if you want to thank them and somehow

557
00:45:12,119 --> 00:45:13,829
form if they want to contact us then that

558
00:45:13,829 --> 00:45:16,049
is the moment and the channel through which

559
00:45:16,049 --> 00:45:18,220
must do

560
00:45:18,220 --> 00:45:20,230
remember that the hashtag does not have

561
00:45:20,230 --> 00:45:21,220
numeral

562
00:45:21,220 --> 00:45:23,050
if it has a numeral but they don't have numbers

563
00:45:23,050 --> 00:45:26,380
that is, it will be working with the year

564
00:45:26,380 --> 00:45:29,220
assigned by the style because he is something

565
00:45:29,220 --> 00:45:32,050
Let's say so much emphasis on this because

566
00:45:32,050 --> 00:45:33,580
the last two years we have been

567
00:45:33,580 --> 00:45:36,310
trend on twitter and this third year

568
00:45:36,310 --> 00:45:39,760
online 100% will not be the exception and

569
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:41,290
thanks to the support of all of you

570
00:45:41,290 --> 00:45:43,030
we are going to make it true just like goku

571
00:45:43,030 --> 00:45:45,700
could think of freezer for this entity

572
00:45:45,700 --> 00:45:48,520
Love, well, we are going to be able to be

573
00:45:48,520 --> 00:45:50,619
trend and we will make all

574
00:45:50,619 --> 00:45:53,140
people behind the screen

575
00:45:53,140 --> 00:45:54,880
as well as our speakers because

576
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:56,890
feel all this digital love and everything

577
00:45:56,890 --> 00:46:00,170
What do you have to give us?

578
00:46:00,170 --> 00:46:02,990
For this we have prepared a kit of

579
00:46:02,990 --> 00:46:03,790
survival

580
00:46:03,790 --> 00:46:08,059
press this kit is separated into two

581
00:46:08,059 --> 00:46:10,160
parts

582
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:12,470
one that is called here one that can

583
00:46:12,470 --> 00:46:14,660
downloading that site is a bit more

584
00:46:14,660 --> 00:46:17,420
heavy honestly they are more a little more

585
00:46:17,420 --> 00:46:21,470
800 megabytes but includes videos includes

586
00:46:21,470 --> 00:46:23,150
a series of contents that will be

587
00:46:23,150 --> 00:46:25,160
very useful if you want to support us in networks

588
00:46:25,160 --> 00:46:27,710
And if they want to make you feel that love that

589
00:46:27,710 --> 00:46:29,450
we tell each of the spaces

590
00:46:29,450 --> 00:46:32,299
of the event and kick 2 is a little more

591
00:46:32,299 --> 00:46:35,150
light does not have does not have the parts

592
00:46:35,150 --> 00:46:37,690
necessary graphics and all the kit

593
00:46:37,690 --> 00:46:40,160
For example, it has some templates

594
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:41,420
power point for yourselves

595
00:46:41,420 --> 00:46:44,000
put your phrases of the most relevant

596
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:45,559
that they heard from a speaker and

597
00:46:45,559 --> 00:46:47,440
can share in their different networks

598
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:49,910
Let's say that it is also very complete but

599
00:46:49,910 --> 00:46:53,529
don't have videos then

600
00:46:54,230 --> 00:46:56,990
the light the two kits the idea leaves two and

601
00:46:56,990 --> 00:46:58,820
have all the necessary tools

602
00:46:58,820 --> 00:47:00,859
so that this love that I am

603
00:47:00,859 --> 00:47:02,900
Saying that the whole way to all

604
00:47:02,900 --> 00:47:04,100
people who are part of

605
00:47:04,100 --> 00:47:05,900
this event then make yourself felt with

606
00:47:05,900 --> 00:47:08,000
all of the king's because we put together this

607
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:09,290
kit because the last two editions

608
00:47:09,290 --> 00:47:11,450
we have seen that people have prepared

609
00:47:11,450 --> 00:47:13,910
his own schwager and that is why in three of

610
00:47:13,910 --> 00:47:17,210
different elements to show

611
00:47:17,210 --> 00:47:21,190
their love for the event have printed

612
00:47:21,190 --> 00:47:23,750
t-shirts have made many then

613
00:47:23,750 --> 00:47:25,820
airs we are leaving the new

614
00:47:25,820 --> 00:47:27,380
voters we are leaving the

615
00:47:27,380 --> 00:47:28,490
graphic parties we are leaving

616
00:47:28,490 --> 00:47:30,560
everything so they can continue to do

617
00:47:30,560 --> 00:47:33,050
this and that the division that gives us a

618
00:47:33,050 --> 00:47:35,150
screen well don't feel so so

619
00:47:35,150 --> 00:47:37,349
strong

620
00:47:37,349 --> 00:47:39,489
this is this this is airing

621
00:47:39,489 --> 00:47:41,739
on different channels and you are

622
00:47:41,739 --> 00:47:43,659
seeing the softer is the most

623
00:47:43,659 --> 00:47:45,429
they are watching because it is the channel

624
00:47:45,429 --> 00:47:46,989
the main one we chose for this edition

625
00:47:46,989 --> 00:47:49,029
but we are also transmitting by

626
00:47:49,029 --> 00:47:52,239
facebook for twitter and twitch the

627
00:47:52,239 --> 00:47:54,789
idea is that independent of the channel that

628
00:47:54,789 --> 00:47:57,039
everyone is watching the broadcast

629
00:47:57,039 --> 00:47:58,329
questions that want to make see the

630
00:47:58,329 --> 00:48:01,599
speakers let's do it through this link is

631
00:48:01,599 --> 00:48:05,499
leave point m is the questions is the

632
00:48:05,499 --> 00:48:07,119
link will send them to a platform

633
00:48:07,119 --> 00:48:09,519
which is called defined and through a

634
00:48:09,519 --> 00:48:11,439
platform we will choose the best

635
00:48:11,439 --> 00:48:13,329
questions to pass on to

636
00:48:13,329 --> 00:48:15,999
speakers and that can be sent that

637
00:48:15,999 --> 00:48:17,380
does not mean that you by networks

638
00:48:17,380 --> 00:48:18,699
social do not send them their

639
00:48:18,699 --> 00:48:20,799
questions directly to the speakers of

640
00:48:20,799 --> 00:48:22,209
fact it would be very interesting

641
00:48:22,209 --> 00:48:24,549
can do with the hashtag dragon hard

642
00:48:24,549 --> 00:48:26,919
com as I just explained but the

643
00:48:26,919 --> 00:48:30,159
official channel of the questions for this

644
00:48:30,159 --> 00:48:33,249
event will be this link ready all

645
00:48:33,249 --> 00:48:34,719
we will ask the questions here

646
00:48:34,719 --> 00:48:36,969
and the fruits that are going to come out into the air and

647
00:48:36,969 --> 00:48:39,429
that are going to be transmitted by

648
00:48:39,429 --> 00:48:40,959
different times because it will be for

649
00:48:40,959 --> 00:48:42,740
there

650
00:48:42,740 --> 00:48:45,369
we also have a communication channel

651
00:48:45,369 --> 00:48:48,350
Apart from the chats that are in each

652
00:48:48,350 --> 00:48:49,810
one of the transmission systems

653
00:48:49,810 --> 00:48:52,369
true you are watching for winston

654
00:48:52,369 --> 00:48:53,690
those who have a chance are watching

655

00:48:56,680 --> 00:48:59,960
Apart from that and at the request of

658
00:48:59,960 --> 00:49:01,790
all of you have decided to create a

659
00:49:01,790 --> 00:49:04,340
ready channel and one of telegraaf that

660
00:49:04,340 --> 00:49:07,700
you will find in this url that you

661
00:49:07,700 --> 00:49:09,740
look there for the link

662
00:49:09,740 --> 00:49:12,530
therefore suitable for discs and connect

663
00:49:12,530 --> 00:49:14,710
so that we have one more way

664
00:49:14,710 --> 00:49:17,540
two-way communication with all

665

671
00:49:29,590 --> 00:49:32,990

693
00:50:24,470 --> 00:50:27,160
some people have asked me about

694
00:50:27,160 --> 00:50:28,670
certificates and we will generate

695
00:50:28,670 --> 00:50:31,099
attendance certificates and the truth

696
00:50:31,099 --> 00:50:33,260
is that if we are going to do it like this

697
00:50:33,260 --> 00:50:35,000
we have put on our platform

698

finished

744
00:52:20,990 --> 00:52:23,180
our web sponsor I know is a

745
00:52:23,180 --> 00:52:24,920
computer security consultant

746
00:52:24,920 --> 00:52:28,100

747
00:52:28,100 --> 00:52:30,290

748
00:52:30,290 --> 00:52:32,869
you can scan these qr codes and

749
00:52:32,869 --> 00:52:35,220
know a little more about them

750
00:52:35,220 --> 00:52:37,680
we also have to be that we have been

751
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:39,599
supporting a lot in recent years this

752
00:52:39,599 --> 00:52:41,580
year has been linked as a sponsor and

753
00:52:41,580 --> 00:52:44,010
has given us a lot

754
00:52:44,010 --> 00:52:46,500
of licenses of its products so that

755
00:52:46,500 --> 00:52:48,330
we can distribute to all

756
00:52:48,330 --> 00:52:50,520
you then we will have

757
00:52:50,520 --> 00:52:52,109
different dynamics like the years

758
00:52:52,109 --> 00:52:53,790
previous ones in which you can

759
00:52:53,790 --> 00:52:55,560
participate in some of these

760
00:52:55,560 --> 00:52:57,590
licenses

761

we also have a bourbon tip for

762
00:52:59,930 --> 00:53:02,180
many and I personally think so

763
00:53:02,180 --> 00:53:06,140
itself is the best plugin for auditing

764
00:53:06,140 --> 00:53:07,310
[Music]

765
00:53:07,310 --> 00:53:10,370
and web applications through word

766
00:53:10,370 --> 00:53:13,040
swift is an amazing tool

767
00:53:13,040 --> 00:53:15,350
which allows us to say all

768
00:53:15,350 --> 00:53:17,030
manual processes we used to do

769
00:53:17,030 --> 00:53:20,360
before automating them with our

770
00:53:20,360 --> 00:53:21,970
own

771
00:53:21,970 --> 00:53:23,930
configurations and be able to carry out

772
00:53:23,930 --> 00:53:25,510
for our work much more easily

773
00:53:25,510 --> 00:53:28,280
we have class maga here which is also

774
00:53:28,280 --> 00:53:30,050

775
00:53:30,050 --> 00:53:32,210
boutique consultant although she has

776
00:53:32,210 --> 00:53:35,090
presence in many countries is a

777
00:53:35,090 --> 00:53:37,550
Uruguayan construction company if they are

778
00:53:37,550 --> 00:53:39,140

779
00:53:39,140 --> 00:53:42,080
scan these qr codes

780
00:53:42,080 --> 00:53:43,900
but not

781
00:53:43,900 --> 00:53:47,010
just a moment

782
00:53:49,910 --> 00:53:51,950

basically what allows to act

786
00:54:00,079 --> 00:54:02,059
allowed a communication channel is

787
00:54:02,059 --> 00:54:04,400

788
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:06,260

more preambles left us then a

855
00:56:46,669 --> 00:56:48,859
Pablo González an eminence in matters of

856
00:56:48,859 --> 00:56:50,779
computer security in spanish

857
00:56:50,779 --> 00:56:52,819
person that I admire a lot and that this year

858
00:56:52,819 --> 00:56:54,499
He comes to talk to us a little about the

859
00:56:54,499 --> 00:56:58,069
security in smart chen and all this that

860
00:56:58,069 --> 00:57:00,649
it's on the web 3 spoke you're there it's

861
00:57:00,649 --> 00:57:04,959
true if in this

862
00:57:05,930 --> 00:57:09,800
listen perfect perfect well

863
00:57:09,800 --> 00:57:12,280
first thank you for

864
00:57:12,280 --> 00:57:16,180
count on me for this edition

865
00:57:16,180 --> 00:57:18,520
It is an honor for me to be here for the third

866
00:57:18,520 --> 00:57:21,030
time i'm in we'll have yarkon and

867
00:57:21,030 --> 00:57:24,190
well i remember the previous stories

868
00:57:24,190 --> 00:57:26,770
especially the one from 2018 that was face-to-face

869
00:57:26,770 --> 00:57:28,960
my mind went online but I was 18

870
00:57:28,960 --> 00:57:31,569
with great longing because because it was very

871
00:57:31,569 --> 00:57:33,640
funny not to be there in bogotá in this

872
00:57:33,640 --> 00:57:35,550
case I'm fine and

873
00:57:35,550 --> 00:57:39,599
Well, the talk I'm lucky to

874
00:57:39,599 --> 00:57:42,910
petra the event and to tell you today a

875
00:57:42,910 --> 00:57:44,220
theme about the sea with tracks

876
00:57:44,220 --> 00:57:46,630
vulnerabilities is Carlos and all this

877
00:57:46,630 --> 00:57:49,329
of the web 3 that comes to all of us very

878
00:57:49,329 --> 00:57:52,119
fast and that is here is a present the

879
00:57:52,119 --> 00:57:54,069
new future is present coexists the ha

880
00:57:54,069 --> 00:57:56,980
seen again with web 3 and what

881
00:57:56,980 --> 00:57:58,359
we have to see is that the possibility is

882
00:57:58,359 --> 00:58:00,700
the scans at the end

883
00:58:00,700 --> 00:58:03,609
sometimes they transfer a little change the

884
00:58:03,609 --> 00:58:05,380
technology changes a bit evolves

885
00:58:05,380 --> 00:58:08,020
technology but vulnerabilities are

886
00:58:08,020 --> 00:58:10,089
those faces are similar or we drag

887
00:58:10,089 --> 00:58:11,920
technology to the realities of

888
00:58:11,920 --> 00:58:13,680
old technology to another

889
00:58:13,680 --> 00:58:16,350
well this is what we are going to discuss in

890
00:58:16,350 --> 00:58:17,300
the talk

891
00:58:17,300 --> 00:58:19,950
here is the focus of the talk

892
00:58:19,950 --> 00:58:22,500
educational outreach student for

893
00:58:22,500 --> 00:58:24,570
that you do things so that you learn from

894
00:58:24,570 --> 00:58:27,480
jose good with this information and good

895
00:58:27,480 --> 00:58:29,490
representation of crashing but good and

896
00:58:29,490 --> 00:58:32,070
see I'm Pablo González and well there

897
00:58:32,070 --> 00:58:35,109
we have a little my friend about me

898
00:58:35,109 --> 00:58:38,440
and good in the talk of a little

899
00:58:38,440 --> 00:58:40,809
structure more than what we are going to

900
00:58:40,809 --> 00:58:43,299
go see let's explain so that everything

901
00:58:43,299 --> 00:58:44,739
the world can follow the talk and for

902
00:58:44,739 --> 00:58:46,390
that everyone who hasn't heard

903
00:58:46,390 --> 00:58:48,549
never or that I don't know exactly what a

904
00:58:48,549 --> 00:58:51,220
ironwall blogs is a smart contract a

905
00:58:51,220 --> 00:58:52,900
transaction that we are going to explain our

906
00:58:52,900 --> 00:58:54,430
this type of concepts we are going to see how

907
00:58:54,430 --> 00:58:55,809
a contract is reached, what is that?

908
00:58:55,809 --> 00:58:58,210
deploy a contract in a block

909
00:58:58,210 --> 00:59:00,579
change and then we are going to mess with

910
00:59:00,579 --> 00:59:02,109
the security part above all

911
00:59:02,109 --> 00:59:03,640
with types of vulnerabilities

912
00:59:03,640 --> 00:59:05,049
some types of units some

913
00:59:05,049 --> 00:59:07,299
examples we will see real cases and

914
00:59:07,299 --> 00:59:09,489
how many millions of dollars have been

915
00:59:09,489 --> 00:59:11,259
lost why because that from point to

916
00:59:11,259 --> 00:59:12,910
certain vulnerabilities or four

917
00:59:12,910 --> 00:59:14,470
millions of dollars have been lost

918
00:59:14,470 --> 00:59:17,200
because there has been a physio a scan in the

919
00:59:17,200 --> 00:59:19,329
web 3 that there were many users who have

920
00:59:19,329 --> 00:59:20,220
lost

921
00:59:20,220 --> 00:59:24,009
your touches with subscribed coins for

922
00:59:24,009 --> 00:59:26,529
an anthro value at the end leave in a

923
00:59:26,529 --> 00:59:28,560
time to make a demo

924
00:59:28,560 --> 00:59:31,500
and we will do it at the end of a web strike 3

925
00:59:31,500 --> 00:59:33,860
for all the world to see the pieces and

926
00:59:33,860 --> 00:59:36,690
well the risks that exist today

927
00:59:36,690 --> 00:59:38,490
and that little by little as in all

928
00:59:38,490 --> 00:59:41,400
technologies because they will be solving as

929
00:59:41,400 --> 00:59:43,050
It always happens because of technology and

930
00:59:43,050 --> 00:59:47,490
loud rupert and then little security

931
00:59:47,490 --> 00:59:48,810
little by little it is making its way in the

932
00:59:48,810 --> 00:59:51,090
technologies to be able to certify the

933
00:59:51,090 --> 00:59:52,500
what happens that on the web 3

934
00:59:52,500 --> 00:59:54,030
when we talk about smart with tracks there

935
00:59:54,030 --> 00:59:55,770
we are always handling transactions

936
00:59:55,770 --> 00:59:58,110
and transactions that of course

937
00:59:58,110 --> 01:00:00,180
have a value then there is clear the

938
01:00:00,180 --> 01:00:03,360
security is vital not for this not

939
01:00:03,360 --> 01:00:05,280
it's tomorrow we can use it

940
01:00:05,280 --> 01:00:07,470
as people as society as

941
01:00:07,470 --> 01:00:11,369
companies safely

942
01:00:11,369 --> 01:00:13,670
that we have confidence

943
01:00:13,670 --> 01:00:14,930
ok let's start with the series

944
01:00:14,930 --> 01:00:15,849
concepts

945
01:00:15,849 --> 01:00:18,200
blogs all over the world has gone talk about

946
01:00:18,200 --> 01:00:19,910
that everyone knows more or less

947
01:00:19,910 --> 01:00:22,400
injured boxing doesn't know what he says

948
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:26,000
he is very sure he does not know that he is a species

949
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,010
distributed database that's good

950
01:00:28,010 --> 01:00:29,359
if it is a technology that registers

951
01:00:29,359 --> 01:00:31,460
information we can see that's how it is

952
01:00:31,460 --> 01:00:33,170
as a very large distributed log

953
01:00:33,170 --> 01:00:35,690
and in the end if we go down a bit to

954
01:00:35,690 --> 01:00:38,119
technology is a peer to peer network is

955
01:00:38,119 --> 01:00:40,250
a youtube network and like any other

956
01:00:40,250 --> 01:00:41,990
what happens that each node what

957
01:00:41,990 --> 01:00:44,089
stores is a copy of the string

958
01:00:44,089 --> 01:00:46,970
blogs of those bloc 6 no and that's what

959
01:00:46,970 --> 01:00:48,589
remind her that if we have many

960
01:00:48,589 --> 01:00:49,970
modes and each have a copy

961
01:00:49,970 --> 01:00:53,000
identical to pad singh if anyone

962
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:55,430
enters one modifies the string

963
01:00:55,430 --> 01:00:57,170
blocks nothing happens because the rest

964
01:00:57,170 --> 01:00:58,850
of the network

965
01:00:58,850 --> 01:01:02,960
have a copy of this this integrity

966
01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:05,300
of this new has been violated but not

967
01:01:05,300 --> 01:01:06,800
nothing happens because there are thousands of 9 knots

968
01:01:06,800 --> 01:01:10,190
more and that's the problem you don't have to

969
01:01:10,190 --> 01:01:11,930
there is the issue of 51 percent, that is

970
01:01:11,930 --> 01:01:13,520
whatever it is to be able to assume this network as

971
01:01:13,520 --> 01:01:15,560
he could handle it as he pleased well

972
01:01:15,560 --> 01:01:17,560
theoretically yes and

973
01:01:17,560 --> 01:01:20,210
well, the next final is not one

974
01:01:20,210 --> 01:01:22,730
block structure have launched that

975
01:01:22,730 --> 01:01:24,830
advantage that forms a great list of

976
01:01:24,830 --> 01:01:26,360
additional information check others

977
01:01:26,360 --> 01:01:30,070
actions on the rest of the information

978
01:01:31,320 --> 01:01:34,170
if we paint it a bit we can see how

979
01:01:34,170 --> 01:01:35,000
that

980
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:37,860
be a schema if of the nodes is all

981
01:01:37,860 --> 01:01:39,570
a peer-to-peer network more or less all

982
01:01:39,570 --> 01:01:42,480
they talk to everyone and within each node

983
01:01:42,480 --> 01:01:44,370
we have a copy of a string

984
01:01:44,370 --> 01:01:46,070
white

985
01:01:46,070 --> 01:01:49,130
if we go to the concept of google & portfolio

986
01:01:49,130 --> 01:01:51,470
wallet purse is to have a

987
01:01:51,470 --> 01:01:52,940
application an application that manages

988
01:01:52,940 --> 01:01:55,550
two types of classes the republic and one

989
01:01:55,550 --> 01:01:57,860
private key is pure cryptography

990
01:01:57,860 --> 01:01:59,360
public key for the four base of the

991
01:01:59,360 --> 01:02:01,850
direction to the portfolio is what is the

992
01:02:01,850 --> 01:02:03,170
banking world we would say is ours

993
01:02:03,170 --> 01:02:05,000
account number

994
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:06,680
and the private key is what allows

995
01:02:06,680 --> 01:02:08,240
make transactions plus allow

996
01:02:08,240 --> 01:02:10,010
sign those transactions verify that

997
01:02:10,010 --> 01:02:12,080
It's me and I want to do that

998
01:02:12,080 --> 01:02:14,390
transaction and is our key to

999
01:02:14,390 --> 01:02:17,050
be able to use private creation or sign

1000
01:02:17,050 --> 01:02:19,160
well we will see this in the future

1001
01:02:19,160 --> 01:02:21,080
little more but to outline a

1002
01:02:21,080 --> 01:02:23,720
little left you have a drawing of the

1003
01:02:23,720 --> 01:02:25,190
public address so that everyone

1004
01:02:25,190 --> 01:02:27,800
logically I can see it

1005
01:02:27,800 --> 01:02:30,260
and in which we have to deliver and the

1006
01:02:30,260 --> 01:02:31,250
private key that we have to

1007
01:02:31,250 --> 01:02:34,100
protect by being simple to use

1008
01:02:34,100 --> 01:02:36,320
that right there you have a software that

1009
01:02:36,320 --> 01:02:38,420
man ganache in garages a block ching

1010
01:02:38,420 --> 01:02:41,840
local we will use the local for for

1011
01:02:41,840 --> 01:02:45,050
be able to develop and test the

1012
01:02:45,050 --> 01:02:46,790
sea ​​with tracks unfold them in one night

1013
01:02:46,790 --> 01:02:49,590
in local control by us

1014
01:02:49,590 --> 01:02:52,130
be able to do security

1015
01:02:52,130 --> 01:02:54,510
dynamic for example we see this

1016
01:02:54,510 --> 01:02:57,570
after and win allows us to manage in

1017
01:02:57,570 --> 01:03:00,780
accounts the public account under the

1018
01:03:00,780 --> 01:03:03,270
of private is longer than that of the

1019
01:03:03,270 --> 01:03:06,500
that we have and that is an example

1020
01:03:06,500 --> 01:03:10,980
well that is a smart against in the end it is

1021
01:03:10,980 --> 01:03:12,630
an application are not those that an apply

1022
01:03:12,630 --> 01:03:14,790
an application type is code that

1023
01:03:14,790 --> 01:03:16,320
it runs on a bit when we

1024
01:03:16,320 --> 01:03:18,270
they ask smart against what will be executed

1025
01:03:18,270 --> 01:03:19,830
blogs and also is running the

1026
01:03:19,830 --> 01:03:21,690
pardoned in a way a tablet is displayed

1027
01:03:21,690 --> 01:03:24,900
if that is correct it is worth all

1028
01:03:24,900 --> 01:03:26,190
changes with social about adding against

1029
01:03:26,190 --> 01:03:28,710
will be stored and registered in the

1030
01:03:28,710 --> 01:03:31,050
bloc if it is capable of executing actions in

1031
01:03:31,050 --> 01:03:33,300
function of inputs to rne parameters

1032
01:03:33,300 --> 01:03:35,670
Let's go with the application remember what

1033
01:03:35,670 --> 01:03:37,500
they taught us

1034
01:03:37,500 --> 01:03:39,330
many years ago they didn't tell me well

1035
01:03:39,330 --> 01:03:40,740
program that is because it has zones

1036
01:03:40,740 --> 01:03:42,390
inputs the program performs a series

1037
01:03:42,390 --> 01:03:44,700
of actions and we have the outputs, then

1038
01:03:44,700 --> 01:03:47,910
is where you marked the contract does not have

1039
01:03:47,910 --> 01:03:49,950
intermediary for him is not selling a

1040
01:03:49,950 --> 01:03:51,810
third but at the end we display a

1041
01:03:51,810 --> 01:03:54,480
contract people join that contract

1042
01:03:54,480 --> 01:03:57,210
and between them

1043
01:03:57,210 --> 01:03:59,370
what the code indicates is whatever it is

1044
01:03:59,370 --> 01:04:02,570
whatever there are no interpretations

1045
01:04:02,570 --> 01:04:06,020
is centralized is immutable between

1046
01:04:06,020 --> 01:04:07,760
immutable quotes because well you are going to

1047
01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:09,350
see later that there are some ways

1048
01:04:09,350 --> 01:04:11,810
to update using proxy textures

1049
01:04:11,810 --> 01:04:13,310
so that the code can be changed

1050
01:04:13,310 --> 01:04:14,960
because the code can't change in

1051
01:04:14,960 --> 01:04:17,060
regularly a program then yes that

1052
01:04:17,060 --> 01:04:19,670
There are architectural mechanisms for

1053
01:04:19,670 --> 01:04:22,400
be able to update them but of course only

1054
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:25,310
a little more advanced is the one made

1055
01:04:25,310 --> 01:04:27,320
immutable quoted and transparent

1056
01:04:27,320 --> 01:04:29,900
everyone can see what it contains

1057
01:04:29,900 --> 01:04:31,370
the sea against all the world can see

1058
01:04:31,370 --> 01:04:33,230
than any one bloch in the whole world

1059
01:04:33,230 --> 01:04:34,910
You can see the about transactions at

1060
01:04:34,910 --> 01:04:37,940
the operations carried out by an address or

1061
01:04:37,940 --> 01:04:40,120
what makes a normal against

1062
01:04:40,120 --> 01:04:42,340
if we see it in the visual plane again

1063
01:04:42,340 --> 01:04:43,500
we have

1064
01:04:43,500 --> 01:04:45,690
a kind of blocks and

1065
01:04:45,690 --> 01:04:47,310
[Music]

1066
01:04:47,310 --> 01:04:48,880
12

1067
01:04:48,880 --> 01:04:50,580
2

1068
01:04:50,580 --> 01:04:54,310
with the block sing inside and we have

1069
01:04:54,310 --> 01:04:57,130
fallen into this new here we have there

1070
01:04:57,130 --> 01:04:58,480
two weeks against running genes

1071
01:04:58,480 --> 01:05:03,120
look here is one unfolded two

1072
01:05:04,200 --> 01:05:06,599
in action

1073
01:05:06,599 --> 01:05:09,749
and the copy of the people in this new order

1074
01:05:09,749 --> 01:05:11,940
in action

1075
01:05:11,940 --> 01:05:14,400
ok let's go with the transaction

1076
01:05:14,400 --> 01:05:16,440
a transaction at the end is when that

1077
01:05:16,440 --> 01:05:18,030
banking action to that shipment of funds from

1078
01:05:18,030 --> 01:05:20,610
one account to another or from one account in

1079
01:05:20,610 --> 01:05:24,020
against can also be can send

1080
01:05:24,020 --> 01:05:26,150
touch can be sent

1081
01:05:26,150 --> 01:05:28,560
this coin can be looked at from an account

1082
01:05:28,560 --> 01:05:33,620
in smart against the control to manage

1083
01:05:34,109 --> 01:05:35,670
each transaction is reflected in the

1084
01:05:35,670 --> 01:05:37,920
night really it took a while

1085
01:05:37,920 --> 01:05:39,410
function of the

1086
01:05:39,410 --> 01:05:42,329
function of the type of car that we are

1087
01:05:42,329 --> 01:05:45,420
using that you have the unit

1088
01:05:45,420 --> 01:05:48,269
basic that is the eder and that later

1089
01:05:48,269 --> 01:05:51,059
interprets in wayne that they are 10 to 18 that

1090
01:05:51,059 --> 01:05:52,650
I put the güey because way is used

1091
01:05:52,650 --> 01:05:54,839
a lot when one starts in this

1092
01:05:54,839 --> 01:05:57,269
the world will see that there are different

1093
01:05:57,269 --> 01:05:59,400
measures to see what a wasteland is

1094
01:05:59,400 --> 01:06:00,809
because a leader is very valuable

1095
01:06:00,809 --> 01:06:02,940
then in the end well also

1096
01:06:02,940 --> 01:06:05,880
works with smaller units of

1097
01:06:05,880 --> 01:06:08,140
ox for example sintes

1098
01:06:08,140 --> 01:06:10,840
well here you have an example in ganache

1099
01:06:10,840 --> 01:06:13,180
again of our action that is done

1100
01:06:13,180 --> 01:06:16,180
from a from a direction to a to a

1101
01:06:16,180 --> 01:06:18,070
contract in this case is the one you leave

1102
01:06:18,070 --> 01:06:19,420
the trail after our direction

1103
01:06:19,420 --> 01:06:21,990
team that instead of going to an address

1104
01:06:21,990 --> 01:06:24,220
other portfolios because one is doing

1105
01:06:24,220 --> 01:06:26,260
contract address is that and it is

1106
01:06:26,260 --> 01:06:29,380
trespassing would like to meet a the eaves

1107
01:06:29,380 --> 01:06:32,350
kevin two ears transaction well this

1108
01:06:32,350 --> 01:06:34,510
it is a transaction inside is to remember

1109
01:06:34,510 --> 01:06:35,860
that these actions may be of a

1110
01:06:35,860 --> 01:06:38,920
portfolio to another or but the portfolio by

1111
01:06:38,920 --> 01:06:40,480
smart with hard work against with the

1112
01:06:40,480 --> 01:06:41,940
briefcase

1113
01:06:41,940 --> 01:06:43,510
all right

1114
01:06:43,510 --> 01:06:47,740
let's go with the concept of mendes skin

1115
01:06:47,740 --> 01:06:50,200
deployment the concept of deployment is

1116
01:06:50,200 --> 01:06:52,150
I have done to many people to carlo that

1117
01:06:52,150 --> 01:06:54,160
says good blogging is there like like

1118
01:06:54,160 --> 01:06:55,450
which is running on the brush and

1119
01:06:55,450 --> 01:06:57,580
well really that fruit can give a

1120
01:06:57,580 --> 01:06:58,930
chin but the changes are staying

1121
01:06:58,930 --> 01:07:02,700
persistent in the block change

1122
01:07:02,700 --> 01:07:04,410
how good deployment works

1123
01:07:04,410 --> 01:07:06,329
first to compile the contract

1124
01:07:06,329 --> 01:07:08,250
contract of the end is not bad against -that

1125
01:07:08,250 --> 01:07:10,829
It is nothing more than a code unevenness

1126
01:07:10,829 --> 01:07:12,510
contract that contract can be

1127
01:07:12,510 --> 01:07:14,160
written in different languages ​​the most

1128
01:07:14,160 --> 01:07:17,099
common is solid but there are others but what

1129
01:07:17,099 --> 01:07:19,050
most common is solid and they work in tandem

1130
01:07:19,050 --> 01:07:21,150
cerio virtual machine so the

1131
01:07:21,150 --> 01:07:23,930
exterior and when we compile the contract

1132
01:07:23,930 --> 01:07:28,109
if we get a byte court the alcohols

1133
01:07:28,109 --> 01:07:31,800
and join the buy court in representation

1134
01:07:31,800 --> 01:07:34,140
is what is really stored if we go

1135
01:07:34,140 --> 01:07:36,480
to block xd to blocks y where

1136
01:07:36,480 --> 01:07:38,190
deploy a contract what we are going to

1137
01:07:38,190 --> 01:07:41,430
to be able to see is the balcony and there is the

1138
01:07:41,430 --> 01:07:43,109
balcony is very similar in by colt de la

1139
01:07:43,109 --> 01:07:46,170
machine for example very similar to a

1140
01:07:46,170 --> 01:07:48,180
boycott is at the end is the machine code

1141
01:07:48,180 --> 01:07:49,829
that we would have in our ours

1142
01:07:49,829 --> 01:07:51,800
fish our computer

1143
01:07:51,800 --> 01:07:53,530
from the corners are the instructions

1144
01:07:53,530 --> 01:07:55,790
let's say they are the creation codes

1145
01:07:55,790 --> 01:07:57,890
which is very similar in language

1146
01:07:57,890 --> 01:08:00,470
typical assembler everyone knows

1147
01:08:00,470 --> 01:08:03,140
and then the abi is application binary

1148
01:08:03,140 --> 01:08:05,900
interface is an interface where

1149
01:08:05,900 --> 01:08:07,640
specifies what functions to have

1150
01:08:07,640 --> 01:08:10,370
found that name those functions

1151
01:08:10,370 --> 01:08:12,860
what are the variables of the contract in

1152
01:08:12,860 --> 01:08:14,660
men what types have what names

1153
01:08:14,660 --> 01:08:19,430
have their specific interface because the

1154
01:08:19,430 --> 01:08:22,580
functions the variables the types in the

1155
01:08:22,580 --> 01:08:24,049
what does the contract matter then

1156
01:08:24,049 --> 01:08:26,660
with the bank with the life well one now

1157
01:08:26,660 --> 01:08:27,770
have all the information to

1158
01:08:27,770 --> 01:08:29,930
then call the interact functions

1159
01:08:29,930 --> 01:08:31,939
with the contract at the end of the vii lo

1160
01:08:31,939 --> 01:08:33,500
that allows is to interact to know which

1161
01:08:33,500 --> 01:08:34,729
are the interfaces to be able

1162
01:08:34,729 --> 01:08:36,529
interact by the contract is

1163
01:08:36,529 --> 01:08:39,339
running on one

1164
01:08:39,740 --> 01:08:42,660
wiener that we compiled in the contract what

1165
01:08:42,660 --> 01:08:44,640
we want to deploy because we build a

1166
01:08:44,640 --> 01:08:47,340
transaction of the national company will

1167
01:08:47,340 --> 01:08:48,600
have the contract that contract for

1168
01:08:48,600 --> 01:08:50,310
have habitat bank in European power

1169
01:08:50,310 --> 01:08:53,370
with software it is functional and then we go

1170
01:08:53,370 --> 01:08:55,550
to have chain identifiers that

1171
01:08:55,550 --> 01:08:58,380
You also have to understand that each

1172
01:08:58,380 --> 01:08:59,880
block for example when we talk about

1173
01:08:59,880 --> 01:09:02,640
outer cerium also known as

1174
01:09:02,640 --> 01:09:05,640
meynet main network has a check

1175
01:09:05,640 --> 01:09:09,270
10 other internet networks networks

1176
01:09:09,270 --> 01:09:11,880
test and therefore has six teams that go

1177
01:09:11,880 --> 01:09:17,040
of 12,410 even if it is with a win check for

1178
01:09:17,040 --> 01:09:18,359
example that it is an option that we can

1179
01:09:18,359 --> 01:09:19,770
use to develop to do

1180
01:09:19,770 --> 01:09:21,510
Try the place and stop for a bit with

1181
01:09:21,510 --> 01:09:23,790
all this because we have the chery for

1182
01:09:23,790 --> 01:09:26,340
default in 1337 in which identifier

1183
01:09:26,340 --> 01:09:27,500
of chain each chain has

1184
01:09:27,500 --> 01:09:29,550
identifier that is needed when

1185
01:09:29,550 --> 01:09:31,590
we want to display something we must indicate

1186
01:09:31,590 --> 01:09:33,390
set chain identifier

1187
01:09:33,390 --> 01:09:35,700
Apart from connecting with the probable in

1188
01:09:35,700 --> 01:09:38,640
rpc al that chain songs union point

1189
01:09:38,640 --> 01:09:41,760
very simple by https or by http that

1190
01:09:41,760 --> 01:09:43,189
we are going to connect

1191
01:09:43,189 --> 01:09:47,448
also includes gas is a measure that

1192
01:09:47,448 --> 01:09:48,910
also allows

1193
01:09:48,910 --> 01:09:51,680
use it when we are combining a

1194
01:09:51,680 --> 01:09:55,160
block on the chain the chrome on others

1195
01:09:55,160 --> 01:09:56,870
there are a series of values ​​that we are

1196
01:09:56,870 --> 01:09:58,790
used to build the transaction

1197
01:09:58,790 --> 01:10:00,980
has when we have those values

1198
01:10:00,980 --> 01:10:01,900
grouped together

1199
01:10:01,900 --> 01:10:05,780
in private and send the transaction to

1200
01:10:05,780 --> 01:10:07,270
the night

1201
01:10:07,270 --> 01:10:09,969
so there

1202
01:10:09,969 --> 01:10:11,829
depending on the blog without being the hook

1203
01:10:11,829 --> 01:10:15,190
default is instant is trial

1204
01:10:15,190 --> 01:10:16,970
developmental

1205
01:10:16,970 --> 01:10:19,130
And if it is, then if we talk about saying it

1206
01:10:19,130 --> 01:10:20,750
We are already talking about minutes and if we are talking now

1207
01:10:20,750 --> 01:10:23,720
We talk about other net realities 50

1208
01:10:23,720 --> 01:10:26,150
seconds but hey it's a time what

1209
01:10:26,150 --> 01:10:28,910
hooked us to unfold the contract

1210
01:10:28,910 --> 01:10:30,670
of a thing

1211
01:10:30,670 --> 01:10:32,870
logically important if we use

1212
01:10:32,870 --> 01:10:35,420
ganache or other test environments then

1213
01:10:35,420 --> 01:10:37,500
the cost is

1214
01:10:37,500 --> 01:10:39,870
because all cash today we are going to see a

1215
01:10:39,870 --> 01:10:42,470
little video that I'm counting

1216
01:10:42,470 --> 01:10:45,540
what you see to the right of the night and

1217
01:10:45,540 --> 01:10:47,280
you see ganache we have three accounts

1218
01:10:47,280 --> 01:10:49,170
we have three accounts with ten

1219
01:10:49,170 --> 01:10:51,030
eggers are fake coming with

1220
01:10:51,030 --> 01:10:53,460
exercises at a public address

1221
01:10:53,460 --> 01:10:55,950
private radiation as you see to go to the de

1222
01:10:55,950 --> 01:10:59,010
reader allows us to create the accounts

1223
01:10:59,010 --> 01:11:01,110
there you have ereim point what he talks about

1224
01:11:01,110 --> 01:11:04,920
rss provider on http localhost 2.85

1225
01:11:04,920 --> 01:11:08,310
45 the china and appearing as 5 777 to

1226
01:11:08,310 --> 01:11:10,680
the left but really is we have

1227
01:11:10,680 --> 01:11:13,770
connect it with 13 37 then in the

1228
01:11:13,770 --> 01:11:17,580
problems and buenavista or the blocks

1229
01:11:17,580 --> 01:11:19,620
then good of the graphical interface of

1230
01:11:19,620 --> 01:11:21,570
night is that it is very visual that you

1231
01:11:21,570 --> 01:11:23,460
teach by examining how they appear

1232
01:11:23,460 --> 01:11:26,520
the blocks in the environment look now

1233
01:11:26,520 --> 01:11:28,830
to the left what we have right here

1234
01:11:28,830 --> 01:11:31,440
to the left is that remix is ​​the

1235
01:11:31,440 --> 01:11:34,110
official development environment to be a

1236
01:11:34,110 --> 01:11:35,880
remix

1237
01:11:35,880 --> 01:11:38,040
allows us to connect to different

1238
01:11:38,040 --> 01:11:40,230
james blogs in this case notice that

1239
01:11:40,230 --> 01:11:41,640
we are connected eager to try

1240
01:11:41,640 --> 01:11:43,050
yesterday providers the provider of the

1241
01:11:43,050 --> 01:11:46,800
block sing ganache provider is that

1242
01:11:46,800 --> 01:11:48,630
we are connected to the environment

1243
01:11:48,630 --> 01:11:49,950
right as we saw in the environment

1244
01:11:49,950 --> 01:11:51,930
graphic on the right we see there the three

1245
01:11:51,930 --> 01:11:54,450
accounts that it is exactly three o'clock

1246
01:11:54,450 --> 01:11:56,250
You said layers of the environment to the maximum I'm going to

1247
01:11:56,250 --> 01:11:59,790
know with the same with the values ​​of

1248
01:11:59,790 --> 01:12:00,620
every

1249
01:12:00,620 --> 01:12:04,170
we can work on niners and then

1250
01:12:04,170 --> 01:12:05,790
we have, we can go compiling the

1251
01:12:05,790 --> 01:12:07,770
contracts here look there is a contract

1252
01:12:07,770 --> 01:12:09,780
testing a hello world series a and the

1253
01:12:09,780 --> 01:12:12,840
contract genre world in its day that

1254
01:12:12,840 --> 01:12:14,550
simply what it does is a project

1255
01:12:14,550 --> 01:12:16,890
on screen the screen print the

1256
01:12:16,890 --> 01:12:18,600
message s return that message not when

1257
01:12:18,600 --> 01:12:20,460
in times they contracted identities

1258
01:12:20,460 --> 01:12:21,720
streaming until resolved is a

1259
01:12:21,720 --> 01:12:24,540
absurd but it's a hello world then

1260
01:12:24,540 --> 01:12:27,990
see how you can compile the contract

1261
01:12:27,990 --> 01:12:29,700
once it is compiled you can

1262
01:12:29,700 --> 01:12:31,360
deploy

1263
01:12:31,360 --> 01:12:34,869
clear remix in this case os en carson a

1264
01:12:34,869 --> 01:12:37,300
everything that has been told by him

1265
01:12:37,300 --> 01:12:40,750
road 640 and all that is signature

1266
01:12:40,750 --> 01:12:42,940
everything behind it

1267
01:12:42,940 --> 01:12:45,310
encapsulates which ones you are only going to work on

1268
01:12:45,310 --> 01:12:47,860
when you work with libraries like jar

1269
01:12:47,860 --> 01:12:50,889
jar or with web 3j is directly or

1270
01:12:50,889 --> 01:12:53,170
with laws with web 3 of aiton de

1271
01:12:53,170 --> 01:12:56,080
Payton too, well, if you want to work

1272
01:12:56,080 --> 01:12:58,260
or have program something in

1273
01:12:58,260 --> 01:13:00,489
blocky environments and more evil against

1274
01:13:00,489 --> 01:13:02,170
etc with country then you can

1275
01:13:02,170 --> 01:13:04,330
doing is much and giving is much easier

1276
01:13:04,330 --> 01:13:05,590
for him good for people have one

1277
01:13:05,590 --> 01:13:07,560
decide security

1278
01:13:07,560 --> 01:13:10,650
in the display of the contract you see that

1279
01:13:10,650 --> 01:13:12,630
from that direction

1280
01:13:12,630 --> 01:13:14,720
I mean

1281
01:13:14,720 --> 01:13:17,720
behind

1282
01:13:21,050 --> 01:13:24,190
for takeoff

1283
01:13:27,180 --> 01:13:28,740
62

1284
01:13:28,740 --> 01:13:31,210
unfold and see here in block 1

1285
01:13:31,210 --> 01:13:34,450
as the address that has displayed the

1286
01:13:34,450 --> 01:13:36,310
from address 62 and then to the right

1287
01:13:36,310 --> 01:13:38,440
we see the address of the contract created

1288
01:13:38,440 --> 01:13:41,940
this is the contract address

1289
01:13:42,240 --> 01:13:45,230
and michelle

1290
01:13:46,040 --> 01:13:48,680
address is the contract with the

1291
01:13:48,680 --> 01:13:50,330
deployed has a public address

1292
01:13:50,330 --> 01:13:52,490
that this public address can be

1293
01:13:52,490 --> 01:13:56,900
send a two rooms with contracts to

1294
01:13:56,900 --> 01:13:58,550
diet and you have the functions that have

1295
01:13:58,550 --> 01:14:00,140
contract only the button print on

1296
01:14:00,140 --> 01:14:01,670
In this case, the only function that the

1297
01:14:01,670 --> 01:14:03,530
control that it is good when you

1298
01:14:03,530 --> 01:14:04,850
we press the button because the hello appears

1299
01:14:04,850 --> 01:14:06,410
world

1300
01:14:06,410 --> 01:14:08,900
very simple I already say this is not so

1301
01:14:08,900 --> 01:14:10,610
simple when we already use libraries

1302
01:14:10,610 --> 01:14:12,920
a little more professionalized this is

1303
01:14:12,920 --> 01:14:15,470
very good to take away a little everything

1304
01:14:15,470 --> 01:14:16,640
details that below but good

1305
01:14:16,640 --> 01:14:18,020
you want to know you have to sell yourself with the

1306
01:14:18,020 --> 01:14:21,890
other bookstores ok now that we have

1307
01:14:21,890 --> 01:14:24,170
seen a little the basics very

1308
01:14:24,170 --> 01:14:27,020
very basic of these environments we are going to

1309
01:14:27,020 --> 01:14:28,630
start talking about

1310
01:14:28,630 --> 01:14:30,290
vulnerabilities of some

1311
01:14:30,290 --> 01:14:31,030
vulnerabilities

1312
01:14:31,030 --> 01:14:33,710
what really matters to us then

1313
01:14:33,710 --> 01:14:34,610
Here assume that a series of

1314
01:14:34,610 --> 01:14:36,050
vulnerabilities some area management

1315
01:14:36,050 --> 01:14:39,880
code others that are roads

1316
01:14:39,880 --> 01:14:43,450
to apply analogical others that we

1317
01:14:43,450 --> 01:14:45,220
formulations but are camps

1318
01:14:45,220 --> 01:14:47,860
for example his last crisis of isora ​​and

1319
01:14:47,860 --> 01:14:51,340
We'll see and they're just issues you call to leave

1320
01:14:51,340 --> 01:14:53,420
no more difficult

1321
01:14:53,420 --> 01:14:56,090
but there are different types and then what

1322
01:14:56,090 --> 01:14:57,410
interesting is that if this is interesting

1323
01:14:57,410 --> 01:14:58,820
world

1324
01:14:58,820 --> 01:15:01,940
you can have a lot of information with

1325
01:15:01,940 --> 01:15:03,679
lots of structure

1326
01:15:03,679 --> 01:15:06,500
vulnerabilities that tell us more

1327
01:15:06,500 --> 01:15:08,179
detail is explained that they put us

1328
01:15:08,179 --> 01:15:09,860
examples and then also in environments

1329
01:15:09,860 --> 01:15:12,160
to try things I don't know if you remember the

1330
01:15:12,160 --> 01:15:15,940
dw of w web

1331
01:15:15,940 --> 01:15:20,870
the tau vulnere of application then one

1332
01:15:20,870 --> 01:15:22,480
similar but

1333
01:15:22,480 --> 01:15:25,429
They give us a series of challenges by the sea

1334
01:15:25,429 --> 01:15:26,630
against which we have to detect the

1335
01:15:26,630 --> 01:15:28,900
realities take advantage of them

1336
01:15:28,900 --> 01:15:31,550
as a learning toy is very

1337
01:15:31,550 --> 01:15:33,790
well what kind of environments

1338
01:15:33,790 --> 01:15:36,220
ok let's start with the first

1339
01:15:36,220 --> 01:15:39,850
transit futures of realities already

1340
01:15:39,850 --> 01:15:42,780
better known also because it has been

1341
01:15:42,780 --> 01:15:46,090
used in some cases by some

1342
01:15:46,090 --> 01:15:49,270
users to hack contracts and

1343
01:15:49,270 --> 01:15:51,340
well look at what I put here

1344
01:15:51,340 --> 01:15:52,630
is that it consists of causing a call

1345
01:15:52,630 --> 01:15:54,820
exclusive on game evolution

1346
01:15:54,820 --> 01:15:56,560
I'm going to set the stage for you

1347
01:15:56,560 --> 01:15:59,170
understand well and here what I say is no

1348
01:15:59,170 --> 01:16:00,550
funds are used before shipping

1349
01:16:00,550 --> 01:16:02,050
we can get into repulsive stack

1350
01:16:02,050 --> 01:16:04,240
calls until bottomless good

1351
01:16:04,240 --> 01:16:07,300
Let's see a little detail we have the

1352
01:16:07,300 --> 01:16:08,950
contract to which is vulnerable to a re

1353
01:16:08,950 --> 01:16:12,580
transit and the contract is the attacker the

1354
01:16:12,580 --> 01:16:14,470
contract is called a contract for

1355
01:16:14,470 --> 01:16:16,270
update the google background let's think

1356
01:16:16,270 --> 01:16:18,640
the contract a for example is a contract

1357
01:16:18,640 --> 01:16:20,800
lottery the image those who play the

1358
01:16:20,800 --> 01:16:23,430
half lottery play the lottery

1359
01:16:23,430 --> 01:16:25,370
in stores in tobacconists

1360
01:16:25,370 --> 01:16:27,780
Normally, we would do it with a

1361
01:16:27,780 --> 01:16:30,900
smartphone what happens that the contract

1362
01:16:30,900 --> 01:16:32,760
does not have an option that is good

1363
01:16:32,760 --> 01:16:34,650
funds if the lottery has not yet been

1364
01:16:34,650 --> 01:16:36,510
carried out for example I want you to me

1365
01:16:36,510 --> 01:16:38,840
give my money back

1366
01:16:38,840 --> 01:16:40,849
valdés and a function that is to return

1367
01:16:40,849 --> 01:16:42,280
money

1368
01:16:42,280 --> 01:16:44,500
for when the contract asks me to

1369
01:16:44,500 --> 01:16:46,389
return your funds the contract to

1370
01:16:46,389 --> 01:16:49,360
check the powers says good has

1371
01:16:49,360 --> 01:16:52,000
funds if then I send you the funds

1372
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:55,389
of votes funds worth and after

1373
01:16:55,389 --> 01:16:56,889
update on the information of the

1374
01:16:56,889 --> 01:16:58,389
games of those who leave those who first

1375
01:16:58,389 --> 01:17:00,900
in vial font first returns the funds

1376
01:17:00,900 --> 01:17:03,190
and that it will happen that the contract to

1377
01:17:03,190 --> 01:17:05,230
send the funds knows and that the contract

1378
01:17:05,230 --> 01:17:07,840
I receive the funds there is a function that

1379
01:17:07,840 --> 01:17:09,760
his name is paul buck who have all

1380
01:17:09,760 --> 01:17:12,820
contracts that is to receive are

1381
01:17:12,820 --> 01:17:15,639
in this case we are making bonds that

1382
01:17:15,639 --> 01:17:17,079
it happens that the function folk back to the

1383
01:17:17,079 --> 01:17:18,730
you can program as you want

1384
01:17:18,730 --> 01:17:20,710
then the attacker in this case has

1385
01:17:20,710 --> 01:17:23,579
programmed and saying good if I receive

1386
01:17:23,579 --> 01:17:25,989
a request to form where they are me

1387
01:17:25,989 --> 01:17:27,090
delivering funds

1388
01:17:27,090 --> 01:17:30,280
before the end of the function what I do

1389
01:17:30,280 --> 01:17:31,949
is to request a return again

1390
01:17:31,949 --> 01:17:34,300
then the recursion starts never

1391
01:17:34,300 --> 01:17:35,850
the show ends

1392
01:17:35,850 --> 01:17:37,770
what happens that the contract to you

1393
01:17:37,770 --> 01:17:39,510
look, it is programmed in the way that

1394
01:17:39,510 --> 01:17:40,920
first send the funds and then

1395
01:17:40,920 --> 01:17:43,080
update that if the sending of funds

1396
01:17:43,080 --> 01:17:45,570
the form of the contract function does not end

1397
01:17:45,570 --> 01:17:48,720
It never ends, I'm going to update the

1398
01:17:48,720 --> 01:17:50,760
duty information for which it serves

1399
01:17:50,760 --> 01:17:52,980
He asks me for the return of funds again

1400
01:17:52,980 --> 01:17:54,780
still have funds and in webos send

1401
01:17:54,780 --> 01:17:56,660
funds and thus enter a pile

1402
01:17:56,660 --> 01:17:59,840
recursive there are real cases and look

1403
01:17:59,840 --> 01:18:01,760
twenty

1404
01:18:01,760 --> 01:18:06,330
million and about 72 million August 21

1405
01:18:06,330 --> 01:18:09,810
18 million and you have two cases

1406
01:18:09,810 --> 01:18:13,320
real here you have so that after a

1407
01:18:13,320 --> 01:18:14,670
reading recommend where explaining

1408
01:18:14,670 --> 01:18:18,270
in those cases clear time is a lot

1409
01:18:18,270 --> 01:18:20,730
money is a cost communities

1410
01:18:20,730 --> 01:18:22,490
lot and black

1411
01:18:22,490 --> 01:18:24,510
logically when one develops in the

1412
01:18:24,510 --> 01:18:26,190
bad contract should take into account and

1413
01:18:26,190 --> 01:18:28,350
peculiarities already known and at least

1414
01:18:28,350 --> 01:18:30,090
have security audits

1415
01:18:30,090 --> 01:18:32,180
sources

1416
01:18:32,180 --> 01:18:34,990
with your analysis

1417
01:18:35,210 --> 01:18:36,830
about the infrastructure of his vision to

1418
01:18:36,830 --> 01:18:38,720
buy to try to prevent these

1419
01:18:38,720 --> 01:18:40,400
things can happen but above all

1420
01:18:40,400 --> 01:18:42,050
they already know how it can be located

1421
01:18:42,050 --> 01:18:44,510
Well, you have to try to avoid that it can

1422
01:18:44,510 --> 01:18:46,760
cost us a lot on it

1423
01:18:46,760 --> 01:18:49,670
how to mitigate a trans and well we have

1424
01:18:49,670 --> 01:18:50,960
to make sure that the changes

1425
01:18:50,960 --> 01:18:53,449
occur before making external calls

1426
01:18:53,449 --> 01:18:57,309
that would be advice

1427
01:18:57,309 --> 01:19:00,159
but maybe the best solution would be

1428
01:19:00,159 --> 01:19:02,659
look for blockages

1429
01:19:02,659 --> 01:19:04,639
and remember concurrent exploration because

1430
01:19:04,639 --> 01:19:07,670
we throw a bolt and if I'm going to get out

1431
01:19:07,670 --> 01:19:09,860
a fund if that first return of

1432
01:19:09,860 --> 01:19:11,179
backgrounds like red tea from strikethrough up

1433
01:19:11,179 --> 01:19:14,329
that your form does not finish I do not unlock the

1434
01:19:14,329 --> 01:19:17,570
bolt would be a way to do it

1435
01:19:17,570 --> 01:19:20,360
I leave a video also comment here

1436
01:19:20,360 --> 01:19:22,159
you have the contract is that the left

1437
01:19:22,159 --> 01:19:26,300
you can do a lottery where there is a

1438
01:19:26,300 --> 01:19:29,170
return funds function

1439
01:19:29,240 --> 01:19:31,740
look at that line that we are

1440
01:19:31,740 --> 01:19:33,270
pointing there

1441
01:19:33,270 --> 01:19:34,950
what it does is return the funds

1442
01:19:34,950 --> 01:19:37,070
that they ask me

1443
01:19:37,070 --> 01:19:40,200
even if I had feet that you don't want

1444
01:19:40,200 --> 01:19:41,970
participate the title goes the funds this

1445
01:19:41,970 --> 01:19:44,460
against cakes they ask

1446
01:19:44,460 --> 01:19:47,390
the problem comes from what is returned there

1447
01:19:47,390 --> 01:19:50,910
is to make the return and update

1448
01:19:50,910 --> 01:19:53,420
just two lines below

1449
01:19:53,420 --> 01:19:54,969
then

1450
01:19:54,969 --> 01:19:59,810
Of course, let's see the first one here.

1451
01:19:59,810 --> 01:20:05,179
contract the battery the block

1452
01:20:05,179 --> 01:20:09,190
the block unfolded the good tone stuck

1453
01:20:09,190 --> 01:20:11,650
the contract had no service money

1454
01:20:11,650 --> 01:20:13,450
functions

1455
01:20:13,450 --> 01:20:15,400
the lottery owner himself

1456
01:20:15,400 --> 01:20:17,750
well delivered sellers

1457
01:20:17,750 --> 01:20:21,110
I have seen how two have been sent

1458
01:20:21,110 --> 01:20:23,589
sellers

1459
01:20:23,620 --> 01:20:25,500
the beings of

1460
01:20:25,500 --> 01:20:28,720
carrying wallet light

1461
01:20:28,720 --> 01:20:31,420
contract to contract okay then now

1462
01:20:31,420 --> 01:20:34,950
same if we look at the balance

1463
01:20:35,820 --> 01:20:38,190
2

1464
01:20:38,190 --> 01:20:43,350
because this language but I put them

1465
01:20:43,350 --> 01:20:45,820
We hope that this user has two se

1466
01:20:45,820 --> 01:20:48,430
we welcome a second user and will

1467
01:20:48,430 --> 01:20:52,350
put profession 4 them

1468
01:20:52,389 --> 01:20:55,060
and will make the payment

1469
01:20:55,060 --> 01:20:57,040
in the lottery a new block is generated in

1470
01:20:57,040 --> 01:20:58,870
the night in the contract right now

1471
01:20:58,870 --> 01:21:00,670
has six seats because there is a door

1472
01:21:00,670 --> 01:21:04,330
put four and you should know that this

1473
01:21:04,330 --> 01:21:07,540
user is 11 4 is in that contract

1474
01:21:07,540 --> 01:21:10,360
each contract storing when it has

1475
01:21:10,360 --> 01:21:12,670
put every every fan but now it comes to

1476
01:21:12,670 --> 01:21:14,560
attacker is aware that there is a

1477
01:21:14,560 --> 01:21:17,470
delay attack and good but it arrives

1478
01:21:17,470 --> 01:21:20,560
reaches his oil attack contract a

1479
01:21:20,560 --> 01:21:23,500
you have a contract

1480
01:21:23,500 --> 01:21:27,160
and you need to have a host to

1481
01:21:27,160 --> 01:21:29,680
pay a battery but will start with

1482
01:21:29,680 --> 01:21:33,240
the sb call to start it requires

1483
01:21:33,240 --> 01:21:35,830
send a purse to to be able to

1484
01:21:35,830 --> 01:21:38,130
take part

1485
01:21:38,430 --> 01:21:41,380
and then call the verse

1486
01:21:41,380 --> 01:21:45,460
the fund before the funds will be returned and

1487
01:21:45,460 --> 01:21:47,590
then they will update

1488
01:21:47,590 --> 01:21:51,010
what happens content fullback the function

1489
01:21:51,010 --> 01:21:54,840
from fullback they let that go

1490
01:21:54,840 --> 01:21:57,690
money but yes

1491
01:21:57,690 --> 01:22:02,699
I still have wapa funds and funds and

1492
01:22:02,699 --> 01:22:04,739
Enter Infinite Repulsive Plus

1493
01:22:04,739 --> 01:22:07,260
until the contract runs out of bottom

1494
01:22:07,260 --> 01:22:10,370
pay attention to what they send you

1495
01:22:10,370 --> 01:22:12,290
when they launch attack

1496
01:22:12,290 --> 01:22:14,840
the national attacker is left with 6 is

1497
01:22:14,840 --> 01:22:16,280
that are not yours and you will recover

1498
01:22:16,280 --> 01:22:18,730
also his duty for which he is left without 7

1499
01:22:18,730 --> 01:22:22,060
bits is a trans hostage there

1500
01:22:22,060 --> 01:22:24,910
Of course detecting this towards sometimes is not

1501
01:22:24,910 --> 01:22:26,500
as simple as in this example is a

1502
01:22:26,500 --> 01:22:29,350
example for people to understand

1503
01:22:29,350 --> 01:22:31,540
how it works sometimes not so sense

1504
01:22:31,540 --> 01:22:34,240
like like this no but the essence of

1505
01:22:34,240 --> 01:22:35,490
facing that attack is this

1506
01:22:35,490 --> 01:22:38,050
historically there have been cases and

1507
01:22:38,050 --> 01:22:40,750
you can study where where of course they have

1508
01:22:40,750 --> 01:22:44,250
cost a lot

1509
01:22:44,300 --> 01:22:45,890
too

1510
01:22:45,890 --> 01:22:48,320
others

1511
01:22:48,320 --> 01:22:50,219
services because one of the things

1512
01:22:50,219 --> 01:22:53,780
safety important

1513
01:22:54,920 --> 01:22:58,890
is very important in the world against what

1514
01:22:58,890 --> 01:23:01,050
is everything and against everything ceases to be

1515
01:23:01,050 --> 01:23:03,390
available when a node goes down

1516
01:23:03,390 --> 01:23:07,110
let the Chinese fall but rather

1517
01:23:07,110 --> 01:23:08,699
the contract suddenly cannot operate

1518
01:23:08,699 --> 01:23:11,219
stays in a deadlock or stays in a

1519
01:23:11,219 --> 01:23:14,520
port hotel is blocked

1520
01:23:14,520 --> 01:23:17,070
so what does a duty mean that is

1521
01:23:17,070 --> 01:23:19,410
a god at finding whatever

1522
01:23:19,410 --> 01:23:20,960
make it go against them I can't

1523
01:23:20,960 --> 01:23:23,940
continue operating because we left it out of

1524
01:23:23,940 --> 01:23:25,560
combat we are knocked out

1525
01:23:25,560 --> 01:23:27,390
then my project which is based on

1526
01:23:27,390 --> 01:23:29,520
the mental framework is ruined because

1527
01:23:29,520 --> 01:23:31,469
I would need to update if I don't have

1528
01:23:31,469 --> 01:23:32,910
a correct update policy

1529
01:23:32,910 --> 01:23:34,640
it can be almost impossible to update

1530
01:23:34,640 --> 01:23:36,540
So you're going to be very careful

1531
01:23:36,540 --> 01:23:38,460
time to create that architecture of more

1532
01:23:38,460 --> 01:23:41,960
cons when of that solution

1533
01:23:41,960 --> 01:23:44,000
who you want to leave out if they are

1534
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:45,530
then they ask us what we are going

1535
01:23:45,530 --> 01:23:47,780
to do is an example let's see a

1536
01:23:47,780 --> 01:23:50,210
example the many that we could apply

1537
01:23:50,210 --> 01:23:51,560
inside the west world at sea

1538
01:23:51,560 --> 01:23:53,840
against and I think it will be understood

1539
01:23:53,840 --> 01:23:56,060
look at a contract that vulnerable

1540
01:23:56,060 --> 01:23:57,520
we have against this attacker

1541
01:23:57,520 --> 01:24:00,950
contract a receives a bid already

1542
01:24:00,950 --> 01:24:03,380
I found all it does is I'm a

1543
01:24:03,380 --> 01:24:06,460
bid house then I offer a

1544
01:24:06,460 --> 01:24:09,350
element and the rest of users or

1545
01:24:09,350 --> 01:24:11,620
contracts are going to bid for him what

1546
01:24:11,620 --> 01:24:14,450
it happens that the bid is higher than the

1547
01:24:14,450 --> 01:24:17,510
changes as it becomes the amount of

1548
01:24:17,510 --> 01:24:19,850
er that he had put the previous degree

1549
01:24:19,850 --> 01:24:23,900
returned to its owner and placed as

1550
01:24:23,900 --> 01:24:26,059
a new winner to

1551
01:24:26,059 --> 01:24:29,629
to the new bidder then the contract

1552
01:24:29,629 --> 01:24:31,909
to push a greater amount than the

1553
01:24:31,909 --> 01:24:33,099
hill

1554
01:24:33,099 --> 01:24:35,619
contract to update my name has

1555
01:24:35,619 --> 01:24:38,960
virtual won to contract vi

1556
01:24:38,960 --> 01:24:40,940
now comes contract c

1557
01:24:40,940 --> 01:24:42,970
this other boxer

1558
01:24:42,970 --> 01:24:46,730
user can push by giving contracts

1559
01:24:46,730 --> 01:24:50,900
as equals the contract is asked to push

1560
01:24:50,900 --> 01:24:53,360
For more Spain, then the contract that is going to

1561
01:24:53,360 --> 01:24:56,780
make the returns the funds to the contract

1562
01:24:56,780 --> 01:24:58,190
del says take that there is someone who has

1563
01:24:58,190 --> 01:25:00,380
bid more than your share of egg to the

1564
01:25:00,380 --> 01:25:02,450
pasta

1565
01:25:02,450 --> 01:25:04,580
what happens in the contract rejects me

1566
01:25:04,580 --> 01:25:07,850
return and I do not accept returns

1567
01:25:07,850 --> 01:25:10,250
then the contract that the

1568
01:25:10,250 --> 01:25:12,110
contract in contract suddenly has

1569
01:25:12,110 --> 01:25:15,720
an exception you don't know how to handle

1570
01:25:15,720 --> 01:25:18,180
and then it crashes and no user

1571
01:25:18,180 --> 01:25:20,520
no contract is going to be able to win that

1572
01:25:20,520 --> 01:25:23,970
bid then the bid ends up stimulating

1573
01:25:23,970 --> 01:25:27,180
and ends or inflates temporarily no one else

1574
01:25:27,180 --> 01:25:29,130
could outbid the contract though

1575
01:25:29,130 --> 01:25:32,000
put tomorrow

1576
01:25:33,840 --> 01:25:36,949
cattle die

1577
01:25:37,460 --> 01:25:39,410
this example

1578
01:25:39,410 --> 01:25:43,160
of another kind happened real

1579
01:25:43,160 --> 01:25:46,020
which is one that caused a possible fall

1580
01:25:46,020 --> 01:25:49,650
of the complete neo network and that was a

1581
01:25:49,650 --> 01:25:52,410
of the first 15 currencies with the highest

1582
01:25:52,410 --> 01:25:53,530
worth

1583
01:25:53,530 --> 01:25:55,989
in the information world of work

1584
01:25:55,989 --> 01:26:00,270
declared this case of course a

1585
01:26:00,270 --> 01:26:03,700
a big problem for a new work

1586
01:26:03,700 --> 01:26:05,560
good mitigations of the gods is

1587
01:26:05,560 --> 01:26:07,210
good that each case would really

1588
01:26:07,210 --> 01:26:09,460
many me against a concrete case for

1589
01:26:09,460 --> 01:26:11,350
let it be understood but there are many

1590
01:26:11,350 --> 01:26:12,880
possibilities many different cases and

1591
01:26:12,880 --> 01:26:14,680
the people who study each case in the

1592
01:26:14,680 --> 01:26:16,360
case that we have had

1593
01:26:16,360 --> 01:26:18,070
first is that it can be prevented from being

1594
01:26:18,070 --> 01:26:21,280
the user i.e. can return it

1595
01:26:21,280 --> 01:26:25,950
when is the new winner that

1596
01:26:26,430 --> 01:26:29,430
Username

1597
01:26:32,100 --> 01:26:35,560
to avoid this type of blocking and then

1598
01:26:35,560 --> 01:26:38,650
they should separate logic from interacting

1599
01:26:38,650 --> 01:26:40,690
with multiple users and this is something

1600
01:26:40,690 --> 01:26:43,290
important

1601
01:26:44,730 --> 01:26:48,030
to be from another video let's see here

1602
01:26:48,030 --> 01:26:50,640
you have the contract contracts the contract

1603
01:26:50,640 --> 01:26:53,570
bid place

1604
01:26:54,159 --> 01:26:57,699
You can see how the function bids where at

1605
01:26:57,699 --> 01:27:00,179
end then

1606
01:27:00,179 --> 01:27:04,329
if they give us starts someone offers more

1607
01:27:04,329 --> 01:27:06,639
are

1608
01:27:06,639 --> 01:27:09,159
that what was there is in the end you get high

1609
01:27:09,159 --> 01:27:11,139
as the new winner and is returned to the

1610
01:27:11,139 --> 01:27:15,050
previous is returned to the previous happen

1611
01:27:15,050 --> 01:27:18,400
and that is written there

1612
01:27:19,130 --> 01:27:23,099
and there is the issue of evolution and what

1613
01:27:23,099 --> 01:27:25,969
we have placed a new winner

1614
01:27:25,969 --> 01:27:27,729
to campus even more

1615
01:27:27,729 --> 01:27:30,380
the example we are going to display the contract

1616
01:27:30,380 --> 01:27:33,250
of the address is displayed

1617
01:27:33,250 --> 01:27:35,860
again the contract and there we go

1618
01:27:35,860 --> 01:27:38,560
start bidding and let's take another

1619
01:27:38,560 --> 01:27:40,710
Username

1620
01:27:41,470 --> 01:27:43,480
and you put two n's for example and you

1621
01:27:43,480 --> 01:27:47,070
bid then from to is the new winner

1622
01:27:49,640 --> 01:27:53,150
examined the block

1623
01:27:53,560 --> 01:27:55,670
sometimes look at the block

1624
01:27:55,670 --> 01:27:58,330
and we have new from nador now we go with

1625
01:27:58,330 --> 01:28:02,630
being there they are going to put you 3 he is son and

1626
01:28:02,630 --> 01:28:05,480
I place one previous winner moves

1627
01:28:05,480 --> 01:28:08,000
its beings are returned, that is to say, it is the

1628
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:10,130
balance of the contract bid and who is the

1629
01:28:10,130 --> 01:28:11,570
winner that corresponds with that

1630
01:28:11,570 --> 01:28:12,660
address

1631
01:28:12,660 --> 01:28:15,560
now the attacker will arrive

1632
01:28:15,560 --> 01:28:17,150
to unfold its contract with the

1633
01:28:17,150 --> 01:28:19,360
attacker

1634
01:28:19,930 --> 01:28:22,600
and what he is going to do is what he does not accept

1635
01:28:22,600 --> 01:28:25,780
payments are not accepted and does not accept contracts

1636
01:28:25,780 --> 01:28:27,150
returns

1637
01:28:27,150 --> 01:28:31,090
there it displays and what it is going to do is

1638
01:28:31,090 --> 01:28:34,660
the attack attack will place 4 you are there

1639
01:28:34,660 --> 01:28:36,560
what to improve

1640
01:28:36,560 --> 01:28:39,310
5 have to improve

1641
01:28:39,310 --> 01:28:43,990
has to improve on the previous one

1642
01:28:44,370 --> 01:28:46,840
attack

1643
01:28:46,840 --> 01:28:49,869
this works and now you see in the value

1644
01:28:49,869 --> 01:28:52,480
bid is 43 and the winner right now

1645
01:28:52,480 --> 01:28:55,630
it's just the address the address of the

1646
01:28:55,630 --> 01:28:58,690
attacker's contract happens to him face

1647
01:28:58,690 --> 01:29:00,070
another user arrives says good I'm going to

1648
01:29:00,070 --> 01:29:03,460
put 5 is to win the bid

1649
01:29:03,460 --> 01:29:07,950
and here in the contract it's okay

1650
01:29:10,260 --> 01:29:13,260
error

1651
01:29:13,560 --> 01:29:17,480
and this is the good

1652
01:29:17,500 --> 01:29:20,050
Well these are some examples of

1653
01:29:20,050 --> 01:29:21,840
guilt

1654
01:29:21,840 --> 01:29:25,170
are critical scenarios because in the end

1655
01:29:25,170 --> 01:29:26,270
[Music]

1656
01:29:26,270 --> 01:29:28,520
we have critics because they affect

1657
01:29:28,520 --> 01:29:30,560
directly to the ecology that is

1658
01:29:30,560 --> 01:29:34,520
directly after this that happens to us

1659
01:29:34,520 --> 01:29:36,890
assets with asset values

1660
01:29:36,890 --> 01:29:39,580
digital I comply

1661
01:29:39,700 --> 01:29:41,380
we also want to talk about what is camps

1662
01:29:41,380 --> 01:29:43,690
because at the end of this world well bring

1663
01:29:43,690 --> 01:29:46,270
the more users in this world then

1664
01:29:46,270 --> 01:29:48,670
more people will also be looking for the

1665
01:29:48,670 --> 01:29:50,490
cheating on this

1666
01:29:50,490 --> 01:29:53,650
kind of pee implants the physics te

1667
01:29:53,650 --> 01:29:57,580
wanted or lies x originates the origin is

1668
01:29:57,580 --> 01:30:00,460
a command what they have here in stores

1669
01:30:00,460 --> 01:30:03,370
the sea with trans europe code that us

1670
01:30:03,370 --> 01:30:05,370
mark a little question of not who is the

1671
01:30:05,370 --> 01:30:09,670
that the one that is referencing the

1672
01:30:09,670 --> 01:30:13,960
request on a function and then

1673
01:30:13,960 --> 01:30:16,810
They look and not, well, the attackers go

1674
01:30:16,810 --> 01:30:18,250
to use different character shapes

1675
01:30:18,250 --> 01:30:21,100
physical and here the origin tx is a point

1676
01:30:21,100 --> 01:30:23,950
critical a bad practice all

1677
01:30:23,950 --> 01:30:26,170
fully fur has low health or

1678
01:30:26,170 --> 01:30:28,210
a few years not weeks with tracks and that's it

1679
01:30:28,210 --> 01:30:30,400
has these elements as well known

1680
01:30:30,400 --> 01:30:32,680
or well-known bulerías elements such as

1681
01:30:32,680 --> 01:30:35,590
very critical or black when it comes to

1682
01:30:35,590 --> 01:30:37,100
safety concerns

1683
01:30:37,100 --> 01:30:38,870
let's see the example so it is understood

1684
01:30:38,870 --> 01:30:41,190
ok this more complicated point

1685
01:30:41,190 --> 01:30:42,960
when i haven't worked with this but

1686
01:30:42,960 --> 01:30:44,790
when workers but first is

1687
01:30:44,790 --> 01:30:48,420
very easy from sant units were hired

1688
01:30:48,420 --> 01:30:50,090
from x origin

1689
01:30:50,090 --> 01:30:52,380
of contract to Martin or the function that

1690
01:30:52,380 --> 01:30:54,390
be a contract transfer to that

1691
01:30:54,390 --> 01:30:56,030
function transfers

1692
01:30:56,030 --> 01:30:59,760
ehlers i said contract elsewhere but

1693
01:30:59,760 --> 01:31:01,949
that function has a constraint is not

1694
01:31:01,949 --> 01:31:05,629
say only going to be able to move ehlers

1695
01:31:05,790 --> 01:31:09,170
if the one who invokes that

1696
01:31:09,170 --> 01:31:12,690
function is the man who says there is a

1697
01:31:12,690 --> 01:31:15,450
requirement is that you x origin sting

1698
01:31:15,450 --> 01:31:18,720
who invokes that function is the over of the

1699
01:31:18,720 --> 01:31:21,200
contract so that no one can move

1700
01:31:21,200 --> 01:31:24,510
as far as anyone can move

1701
01:31:24,510 --> 01:31:28,560
soeters without being the owner of the

1702
01:31:28,560 --> 01:31:30,810
contract between is good but what happens

1703
01:31:30,810 --> 01:31:34,520
they use tx and it's a problem

1704
01:31:37,869 --> 01:31:40,539
the traca of the attacker's contract

1705
01:31:40,539 --> 01:31:42,129
What it's going to do is send some kind of

1706
01:31:42,129 --> 01:31:44,099
fiction the user to a normal physique

1707
01:31:44,099 --> 01:31:48,550
eject for example I have nothing to

1708
01:31:48,550 --> 01:31:50,739
we then have an example the user

1709
01:31:50,739 --> 01:31:52,019
will execute

1710
01:31:52,019 --> 01:31:54,070
looking for the link that does not have to

1711
01:31:54,070 --> 01:31:55,650
run

1712
01:31:55,650 --> 01:31:58,620
will prompt a call against all attack

1713
01:31:58,620 --> 01:32:01,739
against all attack is a method of

1714
01:32:01,739 --> 01:32:04,590
attacker's contract which is the method

1715
01:32:04,590 --> 01:32:07,080
what it will do is invoke with a

1716
01:32:07,080 --> 01:32:09,390
pointer to another pointer contract b point

1717
01:32:09,390 --> 01:32:12,300
attack what it will do is invoke the

1718
01:32:12,300 --> 01:32:14,490
transfer point contract

1719
01:32:14,490 --> 01:32:18,000
Villar, if you look at the contract, he pointed out

1720
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:21,660
transfers is called by the user because the

1721
01:32:21,660 --> 01:32:24,690
tx origin is really the user who

1722
01:32:24,690 --> 01:32:27,300
you are clicking on the second ticket

1723
01:32:27,300 --> 01:32:29,580
Well, that's it, that's exactly it.

1724
01:32:29,580 --> 01:32:30,930
What I would mark, girl, is the address

1725
01:32:30,930 --> 01:32:34,530
public from user to 3ds the user to

1726
01:32:34,530 --> 01:32:37,760
who is to sign that is to that petition

1727
01:32:37,760 --> 01:32:40,350
of is clear entity equisoain the same still me

1728
01:32:40,350 --> 01:32:42,090
it will come out to you

1729
01:32:42,090 --> 01:32:44,790
Of course that user has cheated invokes

1730
01:32:44,790 --> 01:32:47,849
end-to-end contract that invokes

1731
01:32:47,849 --> 01:32:50,200
when is about to transfer

1732
01:32:50,200 --> 01:32:55,390
and of course the mobile is no longer valid for

1733
01:32:55,390 --> 01:32:57,910
this is going to work and i had already put the

1734
01:32:57,910 --> 01:32:59,690
contract sees

1735
01:32:59,690 --> 01:33:01,489
in the contract attack function ok

1736
01:33:01,489 --> 01:33:05,930
Well, just send something from UCB and it will be

1737
01:33:05,930 --> 01:33:08,060
transfer the funds to this

1738
01:33:08,060 --> 01:33:11,600
this is an attack it is a bit if you see

1739
01:33:11,600 --> 01:33:13,490
moving some example because there is a lot

1740
01:33:13,490 --> 01:33:16,010
pointer really a lot of reference but

1741
01:33:16,010 --> 01:33:17,690
is a double reference really going to

1742
01:33:17,690 --> 01:33:19,179
bend another

1743
01:33:19,179 --> 01:33:22,209
but it is an office because really that

1744
01:33:22,209 --> 01:33:25,530
would not work if the user has cheated

1745
01:33:25,530 --> 01:33:27,119
[Music]

1746
01:33:27,119 --> 01:33:29,879
how to protect us however wanted the

1747
01:33:29,879 --> 01:33:32,309
malpractice practice in matters of

1748
01:33:32,309 --> 01:33:34,800
security schedule something with time what

1749
01:33:34,800 --> 01:33:39,229
is immediately the mitigation

1750
01:33:39,440 --> 01:33:43,180
and well we need to see one that is

1751
01:33:43,180 --> 01:33:47,870
it hurt directly and well this what

1752
01:33:47,870 --> 01:33:50,449
is this is that is a term that I

1753
01:33:50,449 --> 01:33:53,780
It comes from Microsoft, it's worth putting it on the site.

1754
01:33:53,780 --> 01:33:56,960
Microsoft and I liked it and good and I liked it

1755
01:33:56,960 --> 01:33:58,000
they wear like this

1756
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:00,080
and well everyone knows what he is

1757
01:34:00,080 --> 01:34:04,330
phishing in the web world two robots is

1758
01:34:04,330 --> 01:34:08,330
private the world the world in three is a

1759
01:34:08,330 --> 01:34:10,520
physicist you will think teo beard the key

1760
01:34:10,520 --> 01:34:13,460
private and it is not so it was not difficult

1761
01:34:13,460 --> 01:34:16,699
normal for normally better

1762
01:34:16,699 --> 01:34:18,830
password use credentials on it

1763
01:34:18,830 --> 01:34:21,830
there is fishing we could not compare as the

1764
01:34:21,830 --> 01:34:23,540
approval of permits

1765
01:34:23,540 --> 01:34:25,520
applications or out for example in the

1766
01:34:25,520 --> 01:34:27,140
production the fihsin in the web world 2

1767
01:34:27,140 --> 01:34:29,540
We see that they went from stealing users and

1768
01:34:29,540 --> 01:34:32,530
passwords to we tried to make

1769
01:34:32,530 --> 01:34:35,810
allow what you give access to ask

1770
01:34:35,810 --> 01:34:38,030
permission to apps or bums not to

1771
01:34:38,030 --> 01:34:40,640
through delegated authentication and

1772
01:34:40,640 --> 01:34:41,990
that kind of things

1773
01:34:41,990 --> 01:34:44,810
with ice fishing in the web world 3 lo

1774
01:34:44,810 --> 01:34:46,400
What happens is very similar to that of the

1775
01:34:46,400 --> 01:34:48,710
applications in the world show what

1776
01:34:48,710 --> 01:34:50,720
is done is delegate to toppings delegate

1777
01:34:50,720 --> 01:34:52,300
my tokens in

1778
01:34:52,300 --> 01:34:56,060
a contract and you can think that

1779
01:34:56,060 --> 01:34:57,170
to delegate I have seen that it is in a

1780
01:34:57,170 --> 01:34:59,300
good contract made when one has a

1781
01:34:59,300 --> 01:35:01,050
token

1782
01:35:01,050 --> 01:35:03,630
and that is nothing more than a contract of a

1783
01:35:03,630 --> 01:35:06,650
contract and the processes it issues

1784
01:35:06,650 --> 01:35:10,730
2000 create that contract for you

1785
01:35:10,730 --> 01:35:13,110
and then there are some applications by

1786
01:35:13,110 --> 01:35:15,059
example a disk that is very famous that

1787
01:35:15,059 --> 01:35:17,480
is a kind of index

1788
01:35:17,480 --> 01:35:20,460
without decentralization that allows us

1789
01:35:20,460 --> 01:35:23,219
passing from one touch to another does not look for the

1790
01:35:23,219 --> 01:35:25,619
color change all this for that

1791
01:35:25,619 --> 01:35:27,960
uniform is a contract needs orders

1792
01:35:27,960 --> 01:35:31,159
of contract needs us to delegate

1793
01:35:31,159 --> 01:35:33,929
let's delegate a series of tokens from a

1794
01:35:33,929 --> 01:35:36,449
big a guy on it so i can

1795
01:35:36,449 --> 01:35:37,980
to do here we are going to see a very

1796
01:35:37,980 --> 01:35:40,590
simple to understand it better look

1797
01:35:40,590 --> 01:35:42,860
here we have a user

1798
01:35:42,860 --> 01:35:46,670
user calculate on a balance that is

1799
01:35:46,670 --> 01:35:50,150
I got a dollar on this level with this

1800
01:35:50,150 --> 01:35:53,300
of the dollar and I have and I have zero tokens

1801
01:35:53,300 --> 01:35:54,670
d link

1802
01:35:54,670 --> 01:35:56,630
notice that it says well what we are going to

1803
01:35:56,630 --> 01:35:59,030
do first is i want a swap

1804
01:35:59,030 --> 01:36:02,659
I make the change and pass my dollar to the

1805
01:36:02,659 --> 01:36:04,550
corresponding amount or I touch the

1806
01:36:04,550 --> 01:36:06,590
dollar to the corresponding amount

1807
01:36:06,590 --> 01:36:09,830
prevented the link that can be one if

1808
01:36:09,830 --> 01:36:11,540
the correspondence only one can be

1809
01:36:11,540 --> 01:36:14,300
With dollars, be two links or three days or

1810
01:36:14,300 --> 01:36:16,300
Whatever

1811
01:36:16,300 --> 01:36:18,130
all right

1812
01:36:18,130 --> 01:36:19,929
what we give and what we say years

1813
01:36:19,929 --> 01:36:24,370
apes well, I leave you rather what

1814
01:36:24,370 --> 01:36:25,239
we say

1815
01:36:25,239 --> 01:36:28,420
the contract that is left we tell you

1816
01:36:28,420 --> 01:36:30,429
Today I approve that the sole contract

1817
01:36:30,429 --> 01:36:34,150
can use in my name they touch me or the

1818
01:36:34,150 --> 01:36:36,190
amount of tokens that I have that I

1819
01:36:36,190 --> 01:36:38,920
I want to give those approve with the meta

1820
01:36:38,920 --> 01:36:40,659
with the least proof with the transaction

1821
01:36:40,659 --> 01:36:43,300
It is approved and ready from that

1822
01:36:43,300 --> 01:36:45,340
moment wefaq has permission we have

1823
01:36:45,340 --> 01:36:48,280
delegate part of my tokens so that

1824
01:36:48,280 --> 01:36:51,120
can be that exchange and move it

1825
01:36:51,120 --> 01:36:52,330
[Music]

1826
01:36:52,330 --> 01:36:54,970
to the corresponding value in tokens of

1827
01:36:54,970 --> 01:36:58,590
link you are worth a delegation of ui

1828
01:36:59,060 --> 01:37:01,490
So the problem is that if

1829
01:37:01,490 --> 01:37:05,390
we do not look at the good

1830
01:37:05,390 --> 01:37:09,900
address to answer the diet of this one

1831
01:37:09,900 --> 01:37:12,970
security lies in this, that is, if

1832
01:37:12,970 --> 01:37:16,030
someone manages to deceive me and that I do

1833
01:37:16,030 --> 01:37:18,670
a delegation of my tokens with a

1834
01:37:18,670 --> 01:37:21,970
contract that is not the original will have a

1835
01:37:21,970 --> 01:37:23,200
problem but it is that the value people me

1836
01:37:23,200 --> 01:37:26,160
said to fix is ​​this

1837
01:37:26,290 --> 01:37:28,990
it is clear it is very difficult the people who

1838
01:37:28,990 --> 01:37:30,370
they are not used to security

1839
01:37:30,370 --> 01:37:33,010
especially when they look at it and send

1840
01:37:33,010 --> 01:37:34,600
this is like when we have to

1841
01:37:34,600 --> 01:37:37,780
set if the domain appeared in the url

1842
01:37:37,780 --> 01:37:39,520
of the presence of the certificate of the

1843

verify that this address really

1846
01:37:46,390 --> 01:37:49,240
public is that of the bonifaz contract if not

1847

he is against everything he is a big fan of

Sebastián example that I am alleging my

1849
01:37:52,990 --> 01:37:57,000
tokens to another contract that will not steal

1850
01:37:58,480 --> 01:38:00,880
there are some real examples as is

here the bayern

1852
01:38:03,300 --> 01:38:06,300
is

1853
01:38:06,520 --> 01:38:10,060
close in time in time and

how will they get a hundred and without good of

be to a code that carries writes in

certain platforms and those those

1859
01:38:24,470 --> 01:38:26,370
transactions when users

1860
01:38:26,370 --> 01:38:28,800
they wanted to make them because they are pointing to

1861
01:38:28,800 --> 01:38:31,290
other side instead of where really

1862
01:38:31,290 --> 01:38:33,490

but we are going to make the demo of this that

1866
01:38:41,159 --> 01:38:44,180
I have here I don't have to

1867
01:38:44,180 --> 01:38:45,610
so we can see

1868
01:38:45,610 --> 01:38:49,599
I will share a machine

1869
01:38:51,270 --> 01:38:53,179
and there it is

1870
01:38:53,179 --> 01:38:56,269
so well first is to teach very

1871
01:38:56,269 --> 01:38:59,570
quickie this center I will not do remix here

1872

I have a series of contracts leave everything

ready i have connect now first of all

1874
01:39:03,949 --> 01:39:05,719
prepared to give here I have the

1875
01:39:05,719 --> 01:39:08,030
deployments of the contracts and I'm going to

1876
01:39:08,030 --> 01:39:10,309
go explaining a little inside for it

let's put here

then we have

01:39:31,650 --> 01:39:33,880
things then we have this address of

change now

is to be here a little icio script in

this end

1895
01:40:01,900 --> 01:40:04,589
and we have

1896
01:40:07,310 --> 01:40:10,130
Well, let's see the process first.

1897
01:40:10,130 --> 01:40:13,890
normal the normal process of a

01:40:18,290 --> 01:40:24,980
we have a guide do not connect to carla

1901
01:40:25,000 --> 01:40:29,220
we see our medium more we go paraguay 3

I speak without the screen hitting you

can you check please

01:40:37,250 --> 01:40:40,270
now it is not seen

1905
01:40:40,670 --> 01:40:43,720
in a second see

1906
01:40:44,350 --> 01:40:46,920
one

1907
01:40:51,449 --> 01:40:53,959
now

1908
01:40:58,650 --> 01:41:01,549
it will be seen

1910
01:41:06,590 --> 01:41:09,100
Already

1911
01:41:09,100 --> 01:41:12,130
and second I'm going to remove the camera

1912
01:41:12,130 --> 01:41:15,030
so that it can be seen to see if we take better

01:41:15,030 --> 01:41:18,030
quality

1914
01:41:18,880 --> 01:41:20,710
and I get share to the virtual machine

not seen

1916
01:41:22,489 --> 01:41:24,499
and if you can share all the

1918
01:41:30,320 --> 01:41:33,159
to share

1919
01:41:38,690 --> 01:41:41,259
go now

1920
01:41:47,970 --> 01:41:51,320
a little machine

1921
01:41:54,710 --> 01:41:58,090

01:42:22,760 --> 01:42:26,050
let's try again

01:42:32,790 --> 01:42:35,750
now

1928
01:42:36,550 --> 01:42:39,160
and I am seeing you perfect because I

1929
01:42:39,160 --> 01:42:42,420
I'm on fire

pleasant that you always have to add me

01:43:18,550 --> 01:43:22,170
the transmission and we create them

the machine but nothing can be seen either

the one in the back is watching your presentation

1943
01:43:49,340 --> 01:43:51,760
it's like the machine that doesn't

1944
01:43:51,760 --> 01:43:54,940
it looks

1945
01:44:02,330 --> 01:44:05,290
and now neither

1946
01:44:08,920 --> 01:44:11,850
now

1947
01:44:12,980 --> 01:44:15,980
either

1948

we will do our we will record now

we go up later people can see it

well we don't have much time left

1953

the demonstration well in the end is a

1954

example of the scj and zinc where where is

1955
01:44:42,330 --> 01:44:44,730
you can see practically is like what

1956
01:44:44,730 --> 01:44:47,070
easier to understand what it is

1957
01:44:47,070 --> 01:44:49,080
to delegate everything to himself and if not to me

1958
01:44:49,080 --> 01:44:51,810
I fixed well who I am giving my tokens and

1959
01:44:51,810 --> 01:44:53,670
that this contract address is the one that

1960
01:44:53,670 --> 01:44:56,460
it has to be in that block yes because

1961
01:44:56,460 --> 01:44:58,610
sure you can finish say a contract

1962
01:44:58,610 --> 01:45:01,230
that someone in your plant for another blog

1963
01:45:01,230 --> 01:45:02,790
it is insisted to connect to another the kings

1964
01:45:02,790 --> 01:45:04,980
may have proposals delegations

1965
01:45:04,980 --> 01:45:07,140
with tokens is something very common in the

1966
01:45:07,140 --> 01:45:10,110
day to day delegate take on contracts

1967
01:45:10,110 --> 01:45:11,700
so that they can manage

1968
01:45:11,700 --> 01:45:14,730
our assets and if we do not pay attention

1969
01:45:14,730 --> 01:45:16,080
well here we will not delegate

1970
01:45:16,080 --> 01:45:18,660
programs in which there is more

1971
01:45:18,660 --> 01:45:21,270
bayern gave recently there was a

1972
01:45:21,270 --> 01:45:24,409
month of june in enough money

1973
01:45:24,409 --> 01:45:26,869
and will be the order of the day

1974
01:45:26,869 --> 01:45:28,400
so we have to have a lot

1975
01:45:28,400 --> 01:45:32,290
patience of it and good

1976
01:45:32,290 --> 01:45:35,410
know how to identify all

1977
01:45:35,410 --> 01:45:37,810
critical elements when validating

1978
01:45:37,810 --> 01:45:42,210
the transaction as conclusions

1979
01:45:42,559 --> 01:45:45,250
tell you that

1980
01:45:45,250 --> 01:45:46,960
how good it is a world that is here

1981
01:45:46,960 --> 01:45:49,120
the web world 3 here and introduce you to the

1982
01:45:49,120 --> 01:45:51,280
future sure but it is already present

1983
01:45:51,280 --> 01:45:54,360
that there are already many people involved that

1984
01:45:54,360 --> 01:45:57,100
you have to be very very very careful

1985
01:45:57,100 --> 01:46:00,510
and learn well then change

1986
01:46:00,510 --> 01:46:04,450
there are going to be threats there are risks there are

1987
01:46:04,450 --> 01:46:06,190
vulnerabilities all we know

1988
01:46:06,190 --> 01:46:08,290
of the web 2 world there are many things that already

1989
01:46:08,290 --> 01:46:10,900
are there and that to mine well we can

1990
01:46:10,900 --> 01:46:12,010
have the people test for which

1991
01:46:12,010 --> 01:46:15,260
we must comprehend and understand

1992
01:46:15,260 --> 01:46:17,870
we must understand for the 3 and the concept

1993
01:46:17,870 --> 01:46:20,600
of destination the new pediment again

1994
01:46:20,600 --> 01:46:22,460
who was he for the block to be

1995
01:46:22,460 --> 01:46:24,980
face are the apps and everything has

1996
01:46:24,980 --> 01:46:26,870
changed a bit but well in the end we

1997
01:46:26,870 --> 01:46:29,300
we will get used to it and surely we will

1998
01:46:29,300 --> 01:46:32,679
we complicate to understand and we will use

1999
01:46:32,679 --> 01:46:34,840
we have to know the risks of each

2000
01:46:34,840 --> 01:46:37,869
new technology web 3 with everything

2001
01:46:37,869 --> 01:46:40,209
what does it bring to meet him

2002
01:46:40,209 --> 01:46:41,590
you have to use tools

2003
01:46:41,590 --> 01:46:45,010
static analysis analysis of the code

2004
01:46:45,010 --> 01:46:48,309
the dynamic analysis of this situation and

2005
01:46:48,309 --> 01:46:50,499
a series of tools where the

2006
01:46:50,499 --> 01:46:51,729
time to audit denver with

2007
01:46:51,729 --> 01:46:54,070
tracks because those tools are passed and

2008
01:46:54,070 --> 01:46:55,360
it is changing as possible

2009
01:46:55,360 --> 01:46:58,059
vulnerabilities already in code or also

2010
01:46:58,059 --> 01:47:00,579
analysis of the boycott is carried out

2011
01:47:00,579 --> 01:47:02,800
analysis of the records and can be

2012
01:47:02,800 --> 01:47:04,659
detect vulnerabilities or failures or

2013
01:47:04,659 --> 01:47:06,849
bad security practices from since

2014
01:47:06,849 --> 01:47:09,400
the compilation and then the part of the

2015
01:47:09,400 --> 01:47:11,159
trustee of

2016
01:47:11,159 --> 01:47:14,550
smart against we deploy in blogs in

2017
01:47:14,550 --> 01:47:17,960
local for example in desire

2018
01:47:17,960 --> 01:47:19,489
Internet

2019
01:47:19,489 --> 01:47:22,710
is more real and you can do the

2020
01:47:22,710 --> 01:47:25,650
tests I am already of interaction on the

2021
01:47:25,650 --> 01:47:28,130
more with tracks and see how

2022
01:47:28,130 --> 01:47:30,450
putting seat in very similar techniques

2023
01:47:30,450 --> 01:47:33,110
in some cases

2024
01:47:34,159 --> 01:47:37,060
and others not so much

2025
01:47:37,060 --> 01:47:38,950
and then also when developing

2026
01:47:38,950 --> 01:47:40,600
the cons bar we must follow a

2027
01:47:40,600 --> 01:47:43,570
insulating policy we must have a

2028
01:47:43,570 --> 01:47:46,870
team you know to take security

2029
01:47:46,870 --> 01:47:49,180
from the beginning as something important

2030
01:47:49,180 --> 01:47:51,940
that we are touching assets of value

2031
01:47:51,940 --> 01:47:54,160
a lot of value then if we have a

2032
01:47:54,160 --> 01:47:55,750
development team that makes us a

2033
01:47:55,750 --> 01:47:57,340
architecture solution we must find

2034
01:47:57,340 --> 01:48:00,010
who know how to program but don't have

2035
01:48:00,010 --> 01:48:00,940
considering the security we have

2036
01:48:00,940 --> 01:48:02,650
future problems we have to have the

2037
01:48:02,650 --> 01:48:04,300
security from the beginning was that this already

2038
01:48:04,300 --> 01:48:06,310
many years not saying that in each

2039
01:48:06,310 --> 01:48:09,820
development process we must have

2040
01:48:09,820 --> 01:48:12,100
security from the start

2041
01:48:12,100 --> 01:48:15,040
analysis well here with more between why

2042
01:48:15,040 --> 01:48:19,860
because we are playing always active

2043
01:48:19,860 --> 01:48:21,510
have the opportunity to leave

2044
01:48:21,510 --> 01:48:24,389
against logic of type structures

2045
01:48:24,389 --> 01:48:25,880
next

2046
01:48:25,880 --> 01:48:29,250
important and then apply the cycle of

2047
01:48:29,250 --> 01:48:31,170
continue to develop secure targeted web 3

2048
01:48:31,170 --> 01:48:33,150
this is very important what i think

2049
01:48:33,150 --> 01:48:36,030
that something is not very clear yet but

2050
01:48:36,030 --> 01:48:37,500
we know that it will appear that it has to

2051
01:48:37,500 --> 01:48:38,940
appear eternal for people to enter

2052
01:48:38,940 --> 01:48:41,699
to this world and development was ensured

2053
01:48:41,699 --> 01:48:42,840
from the beginning and what we are

2054
01:48:42,840 --> 01:48:46,380
suing here as they form teams of

2055
01:48:46,380 --> 01:48:49,500
developers in these technologies to

2056
01:48:49,500 --> 01:48:52,139
through seven months later as per

2057
01:48:52,139 --> 01:48:54,719
example the so vulnerable end you have

2058
01:48:54,719 --> 01:48:56,699
an example but there is more there is enough

2059
01:48:56,699 --> 01:48:58,139
example brother and they are very very

2060
01:48:58,139 --> 01:49:00,030
interesting then to be able to do that

2061
01:49:00,030 --> 01:49:01,770
people are learning and that the

2062
01:49:01,770 --> 01:49:03,800
development twists and solutions that are

2063
01:49:03,800 --> 01:49:06,239
they are generating be as safe as possible

2064
01:49:06,239 --> 01:49:09,119
possible and with this ended my

2065
01:49:09,119 --> 01:49:10,250
presentation

2066
01:49:10,250 --> 01:49:14,210
any questions i'm here

2067
01:49:16,950 --> 01:49:19,380
now pablo thank you very much for your

2068
01:49:19,380 --> 01:49:20,420
stake

2069
01:49:20,420 --> 01:49:23,070
separate the subject with the molar

2070
01:49:23,070 --> 01:49:26,430
content is spectacular I have been

2071
01:49:26,430 --> 01:49:28,860
trying to mess around with this one

2072
01:49:28,860 --> 01:49:31,410
topic of blogging and all

2073
01:49:31,410 --> 01:49:32,520
security issues that are

2074
01:49:32,520 --> 01:49:34,830
related to it and everything that is not

2075
01:49:34,830 --> 01:49:36,600
you are here because the truth is that it opens

2076
01:49:36,600 --> 01:49:39,510
a lot of eyes we have questions like no

2077
01:49:39,510 --> 01:49:41,280
it could be otherwise we have

2078
01:49:41,280 --> 01:49:43,380
enough questions we will try

2079
01:49:43,380 --> 01:49:44,390
do

2080
01:49:44,390 --> 01:49:47,320
say a few

2081
01:49:47,320 --> 01:49:50,619
they ask you what it is etc you recommend for

2082
01:49:50,619 --> 01:49:53,420
smart against

2083
01:49:53,420 --> 01:49:56,390
is the one that I put in the law for

2084
01:49:56,390 --> 01:50:01,940
start is quite vulnerable

2085
01:50:01,940 --> 01:50:05,690
this is how many challenges is a good

2086
01:50:05,690 --> 01:50:07,770
a while

2087
01:50:07,770 --> 01:50:11,250
ready we also have what opinion you

2088
01:50:11,250 --> 01:50:14,490
deserves the 7 carroll apps the share of

2089
01:50:14,490 --> 01:50:18,349
nowhere and piper

2090
01:50:20,369 --> 01:50:23,130
0

2091
01:50:23,130 --> 01:50:27,329
and 7 carroll ave

2092
01:50:27,960 --> 01:50:32,770
piper knowing from piper

2093
01:50:32,770 --> 01:50:35,950
well the opinion seems to me it seems

2094
01:50:35,950 --> 01:50:37,000
social good

2095
01:50:37,000 --> 01:50:39,970
you can can program in solid and

2096
01:50:39,970 --> 01:50:42,280
you may want to make your code with by

2097
01:50:42,280 --> 01:50:44,550
press

2098
01:50:44,969 --> 01:50:48,389
well I don't know the opinions the opinion is

2099
01:50:48,389 --> 01:50:51,690
that seems good to me I don't know is that case

2100
01:50:51,690 --> 01:50:54,690
just to see I am a mother but the other

2101
01:50:54,690 --> 01:50:57,210
it's also good to learn like 20

2102
01:50:57,210 --> 01:50:59,400
means each stand and then the thing about the

2103
01:50:59,400 --> 01:51:01,679
probable third knowledge

2104
01:51:01,679 --> 01:51:04,199
Ready, it seems like a mechanism to me

2105
01:51:04,199 --> 01:51:07,110
quite interesting when it comes to power

2106
01:51:07,110 --> 01:51:09,679
grant that

2107
01:51:09,679 --> 01:51:12,679
provide

2108
01:51:13,370 --> 01:51:15,620
can better analyze certain

2109
01:51:15,620 --> 01:51:18,220
items

2110
01:51:18,230 --> 01:51:21,910
as the riders can organize the

2111
01:51:21,910 --> 01:51:24,500
property of those entities it seems to me

2112
01:51:24,500 --> 01:51:27,060
interesting to be able to do

2113
01:51:27,060 --> 01:51:30,230
relationships or nominations with

2114
01:51:30,230 --> 01:51:34,150
with corner elements

2115
01:51:35,150 --> 01:51:38,570
interesting and another question that could

2116
01:51:38,570 --> 01:51:40,760
be the last in reality because you doubt that

2117
01:51:40,760 --> 01:51:43,780
there are many questions

2118
01:51:44,710 --> 01:51:47,650
but we are going to leave some and the rest

2119
01:51:47,650 --> 01:51:49,450
We will continue them on social networks

2120
01:51:49,450 --> 01:51:51,700
so that people do not run out

2121
01:51:51,700 --> 01:51:52,710
reply

2122
01:51:52,710 --> 01:51:56,910
we have one that says

2123
01:52:00,220 --> 01:52:01,870
what will happen to the block continue with

2124
01:52:01,870 --> 01:52:05,160
about quantum computing

2125
01:52:06,480 --> 01:52:08,670
all right

2126
01:52:08,670 --> 01:52:12,360
well that is something complex before

2127
01:52:12,360 --> 01:52:14,780
answer but

2128
01:52:14,780 --> 01:52:16,830
First what you have to do is

2129
01:52:16,830 --> 01:52:18,240
quantum computing arrive has not

2130
01:52:18,240 --> 01:52:20,300
finished arriving

2131
01:52:20,300 --> 01:52:22,110
we talked about quantum competition ago

2132
01:52:22,110 --> 01:52:24,920
many years to declare the advances are

2133
01:52:24,920 --> 01:52:27,780
important but does not quite reach

2134
01:52:27,780 --> 01:52:30,750
talk when when i arrive of course

2135
01:52:30,750 --> 01:52:34,160
to quantum guaymas they will have to appear

2136
01:52:34,160 --> 01:52:36,870
we already have the new plastics and

2137
01:52:36,870 --> 01:52:38,490
we have standards with new aquatics

2138
01:52:38,490 --> 01:52:42,240
so he figured he'd have to

2139
01:52:42,240 --> 01:52:44,610
refreshed and tender empty in the

2140
01:52:44,610 --> 01:52:47,790
projects and new productions

2141
01:52:47,790 --> 01:52:49,650
thank you very much we will do it

2142
01:52:49,650 --> 01:52:53,040
get the rest of the questions and then

2143
01:52:53,040 --> 01:52:54,780
the public in case you want to tell him

2144
01:52:54,780 --> 01:52:57,980
something and we're done with that

2145
01:52:57,980 --> 01:53:02,930
a pleasure is a measurement you but

2146
01:53:02,930 --> 01:53:05,670
that also in the future and that you enjoy

2147
01:53:05,670 --> 01:53:06,960
many of these days of this

2148
01:53:06,960 --> 01:53:08,310
knowledge and effort you put in

2149
01:53:08,310 --> 01:53:10,860
you on the team for wearing this

2150
01:53:10,860 --> 01:53:13,890
conference to all

2151
01:53:13,890 --> 01:53:15,900
demonstrating many contents

2152
01:53:15,900 --> 01:53:18,120
thanks participate block do those

2153
01:53:18,120 --> 01:53:20,100
words we continue with

2154
01:53:20,100 --> 01:53:22,610
our schedule below

2155
01:53:22,610 --> 01:53:25,670
we have a representative from mexico

2156
01:53:25,670 --> 01:53:29,360
arturo torres and that's it

2157
01:53:29,360 --> 01:53:31,880
with us here in the studio for

2158
01:53:31,880 --> 01:53:34,040
call him in some way and he will

2159
01:53:34,040 --> 01:53:35,690
talk a bit about traffic analysis

2160
01:53:35,690 --> 01:53:36,730
malicious

2161
01:53:36,730 --> 01:53:39,500
using one of the tools

2162
01:53:39,500 --> 01:53:41,530
excellence in

2163
01:53:41,530 --> 01:53:43,480
Let's say that for all the people who

2164
01:53:43,480 --> 01:53:45,190
they reach the networks but also for

2165
01:53:45,190 --> 01:53:46,330
many of the people who dedicate ourselves

2166
01:53:46,330 --> 01:53:48,190
to the computer security that is

2167
01:53:48,190 --> 01:53:51,570
whatsapp and arturo you are already there true

2168
01:53:51,570 --> 01:53:54,910
or the street you listen to me and I listen

2169
01:53:54,910 --> 01:53:57,010
perfect I tell you then the public is

2170
01:53:57,010 --> 01:53:58,290
all yours

2171
01:53:58,290 --> 01:54:02,830
excellent I will share my screen and

2172
01:54:02,830 --> 01:54:04,320
please me

2173
01:54:04,320 --> 01:54:09,870
let me know if you can out there and see

2174
01:54:22,080 --> 01:54:25,320
[Music]

2175
01:54:25,320 --> 01:54:27,750
but

2176
01:54:27,750 --> 01:54:30,640
you already know screen you can confirm by

2177
01:54:30,640 --> 01:54:33,010
please true I am asking you but

2178
01:54:33,010 --> 01:54:34,270
I'll confirm for the others

2179
01:54:34,270 --> 01:54:36,500
transmissions

2180
01:54:36,500 --> 01:54:39,040
more

2181
01:54:41,730 --> 01:54:45,230
say I confirm it happens

2182
01:54:47,400 --> 01:54:53,030
ready and I already see your by size

2183
01:54:53,280 --> 01:54:57,120
very good well good morning everyone

2184
01:54:57,120 --> 01:54:59,400
thank you very much for the invitation

2185
01:54:59,400 --> 01:55:02,130
the truth is that I am very excited about

2186
01:55:02,130 --> 01:55:03,450
be around here my name is antonio

2187
01:55:03,450 --> 01:55:06,630
Torres and the truth is that I am I declare myself

2188
01:55:06,630 --> 01:55:08,550
fan of this event for a long time

2189
01:55:08,550 --> 01:55:09,960
weather

2190
01:55:09,960 --> 01:55:11,760
It is one of the best events for me.

2191
01:55:11,760 --> 01:55:13,890
seem to speak Spanish globally

2192
01:55:13,890 --> 01:55:15,600
And in Latin America, well, what can we do?

2193
01:55:15,600 --> 01:55:17,970
say no first thank the

2194
01:55:17,970 --> 01:55:20,130
organizers for all the effort

2195
01:55:20,130 --> 01:55:21,810
the organization

2196
01:55:21,810 --> 01:55:23,730
so make possible this kind of

2197
01:55:23,730 --> 01:55:26,520
events year after year because it is something

2198
01:55:26,520 --> 01:55:29,180
Awesome

2199
01:55:29,490 --> 01:55:31,140
today we are going to

2200
01:55:31,140 --> 01:55:33,840
talk a bit about analysis

2201
01:55:33,840 --> 01:55:35,670
traffic

2202
01:55:35,670 --> 01:55:37,440
specifically doing analysis of

2203
01:55:37,440 --> 01:55:39,690
malicious traffic and we will use

2204
01:55:39,690 --> 01:55:41,670
As well, they already talked about one of them

2205
01:55:41,670 --> 01:55:43,650
the most well-known tools and

2206
01:55:43,650 --> 01:55:46,350
most important in regards to you networks and

2207
01:55:46,350 --> 01:55:49,530
of course about computing and it's nothing

2208
01:55:49,530 --> 01:55:51,750
more and nothing less than save and me

2209
01:55:51,750 --> 01:55:54,360
I present with you my name is arturo

2210
01:55:54,360 --> 01:55:57,450
Torres, I have more than 10 years of

2211
01:55:57,450 --> 01:55:59,310
experience working on issues

2212
01:55:59,310 --> 01:56:01,920
cybersecurity and currently well

2213
01:56:01,920 --> 01:56:05,550
I have the responsibility of working

2214
01:56:05,550 --> 01:56:07,830
a research team from

2215
01:56:07,830 --> 01:56:08,940
threat intelligence

2216
01:56:08,940 --> 01:56:10,920
cybernetics called fortiguard

2217
01:56:10,920 --> 01:56:12,570
lapse that is part of the company

2218
01:56:12,570 --> 01:56:16,380
additional fortinet well well I already have

2219
01:56:16,380 --> 01:56:18,720
well, already about eight

2220
01:56:18,720 --> 01:56:20,220
years as a teacher by name

2221
01:56:20,220 --> 01:56:22,500
most important universities in mexico

2222
01:56:22,500 --> 01:56:23,970
the autonomous university of nuevo león

2223
01:56:23,970 --> 01:56:26,520
there we work at the undergraduate level and

2224
01:56:26,520 --> 01:56:27,840
well, we also work at level

2225
01:56:27,840 --> 01:56:30,930
mastery and well I like it a lot

2226
01:56:30,930 --> 01:56:33,930
be at industry events and around

2227
01:56:33,930 --> 01:56:35,220
there are a couple of events where we've

2228
01:56:35,220 --> 01:56:37,580
been participating and well finally

2229
01:56:37,580 --> 01:56:40,770
Now I am going to be able to put in this

2230
01:56:40,770 --> 01:56:44,790
slide and then leave is not an honor for

2231
01:56:44,790 --> 01:56:47,280
me to be here not now because we are going to

2232
01:56:47,280 --> 01:56:49,260
talk about this what's wrong with it

2233
01:56:49,260 --> 01:56:51,060
important to talk a little about

2234
01:56:51,060 --> 01:56:53,700
traffic analysis good us

2235
01:56:53,700 --> 01:56:57,180
We know that there are many problems that

2236
01:56:57,180 --> 01:56:58,710
can happen in today's world

2237
01:56:58,710 --> 01:57:01,110
technological world no longer than the day of

2238
01:57:01,110 --> 01:57:03,300
Today, everything is connected by what

2239
01:57:03,300 --> 01:57:06,480
both us and IT professionals

2240
01:57:06,480 --> 01:57:08,640
from security we need to be

2241
01:57:08,640 --> 01:57:11,400
prepared all the time with our

2242
01:57:11,400 --> 01:57:14,250
tools not in our guns

2243
01:57:14,250 --> 01:57:16,230
battle how can we say and this is

2244
01:57:16,230 --> 01:57:18,570
in order to do some kind of

2245
01:57:18,570 --> 01:57:20,760
propulsion and do some analysis and

2246
01:57:20,760 --> 01:57:23,250
we find slow anomalies or

2247
01:57:23,250 --> 01:57:24,989
even then problems of any

2248
01:57:24,989 --> 01:57:28,410
situation is not to say each of these

2249
01:57:28,410 --> 01:57:30,620
problems we have seen lately

2250
01:57:30,620 --> 01:57:34,010
especially in cybersecurity issues

2251
01:57:34,010 --> 01:57:36,210
it basically starts with a package

2252
01:57:36,210 --> 01:57:39,090
sent to the network not to an application

2253
01:57:39,090 --> 01:57:40,950
towards a web page based on a

2254
01:57:40,950 --> 01:57:43,560
device and this can grow from

2255
01:57:43,560 --> 01:57:46,230
exponentially until then let's say

2256
01:57:46,230 --> 01:57:49,950
thus generate some type of inactivity

2257
01:57:49,950 --> 01:57:51,810
on the network will not affect the

2258
01:57:51,810 --> 01:57:52,670
availability

2259
01:57:52,670 --> 01:57:56,190
now there are even packages that

2260
01:57:56,190 --> 01:57:58,440
run within a system and when

2261
01:57:58,440 --> 01:58:00,180
less you realize the system begins to

2262
01:58:00,180 --> 01:58:02,340
behave in a malicious way

2263
01:58:02,340 --> 01:58:04,230
begins to release information

2264
01:58:04,230 --> 01:58:06,660
start scanning within the network and

2265
01:58:06,660 --> 01:58:09,570
others not then the idea is to understand a

2266
01:58:09,570 --> 01:58:11,280
little how to do this analysis of

2267
01:58:11,280 --> 01:58:13,440
traffic to get there

2268
01:58:13,440 --> 01:58:15,239
Well, to the root cause of some problem

2269
01:58:15,239 --> 01:58:17,910
that we already understand and well

2270
01:58:17,910 --> 01:58:20,040
nothing better than doing it at the package level

2271
01:58:20,040 --> 01:58:21,400
this session

2272
01:58:21,400 --> 01:58:22,920
[Music]

2273
01:58:22,920 --> 01:58:25,560
is a set of different classes that

2274
01:58:25,560 --> 01:58:27,920
we have been developing

2275
01:58:27,920 --> 01:58:30,270
these are the books for the

2276
01:58:30,270 --> 01:58:32,969
Which of us, then, we went to

2277
01:58:32,969 --> 01:58:34,380
work to generate this session

2278
01:58:34,380 --> 01:58:36,600
additional these are books that out there

2279
01:58:36,600 --> 01:58:38,580
I highly recommend if you want

2280
01:58:38,580 --> 01:58:40,430
learn to do traffic analysis

2281
01:58:40,430 --> 01:58:42,690
specifically focused on issues of

2282
01:58:42,690 --> 01:58:43,699
cybersecurity

2283
01:58:43,699 --> 01:58:46,020
what I am going to present to you is a

2284
01:58:46,020 --> 01:58:49,050
summary of four months of classes

2285
01:58:49,050 --> 01:58:50,660
master level

2286
01:58:50,660 --> 01:58:53,760
where we are going to see from zero to the

2287
01:58:53,760 --> 01:58:55,530
I will be able to do a little about

2288
01:58:55,530 --> 01:58:57,390
traffic analysis including forensics of

2289
01:58:57,390 --> 01:58:59,520
network I also do not recommend them there

2290
01:58:59,520 --> 01:59:01,590
there is a youtube channel called

2291
01:59:01,590 --> 01:59:04,440
shark fest is a global event of war

2292
01:59:04,440 --> 01:59:06,480
be from traffic analysis just be

2293
01:59:06,480 --> 01:59:09,600
the week I do not remember the edition of this

2294
01:59:09,600 --> 01:59:11,910
year the 22nd and well, even we are going to

2295
01:59:11,910 --> 01:59:14,150
see maybe a couple of exercises

2296
01:59:14,150 --> 01:59:17,790
focused on this of all this that

2297
01:59:17,790 --> 01:59:20,930
we have just seen not now for those who

2298
01:59:20,930 --> 01:59:23,120
the best do not have so much experience in

2299
01:59:23,120 --> 01:59:26,390
traffic analysis issues or if

2300
01:59:26,390 --> 01:59:27,650
you have never used

2301
01:59:27,650 --> 01:59:29,990
training they have seen it but

2302
01:59:29,990 --> 01:59:32,570
it can suddenly be a bit overwhelming

2303
01:59:32,570 --> 01:59:34,040
I am going to ask the most experts to

2304
01:59:34,040 --> 01:59:36,260
give me a couple of minutes so we can talk

2305
01:59:36,260 --> 01:59:37,940
a bit about the introduction of what

2306
01:59:37,940 --> 01:59:39,100
is this is not

2307
01:59:39,100 --> 01:59:41,840
traffic analysis or analysis of

2308
01:59:41,840 --> 01:59:43,460
packages is also known as

2309
01:59:43,460 --> 01:59:45,440
example as sniffer or tracking of

2310
01:59:45,440 --> 01:59:47,990
packet or protocol analysis this

2311
01:59:47,990 --> 01:59:50,020
is used to intercept

2312
01:59:50,020 --> 01:59:53,510
capture and interpret live data that

2313
01:59:53,510 --> 01:59:55,640
travel through the network not either and

2314
01:59:55,640 --> 01:59:57,530
here when I talk about the network I prefer to

2315
01:59:57,530 --> 01:59:59,420
through a cable or even against

2316
01:59:59,420 --> 02:00:02,390
a wifi network and this is for the purpose

2317
02:00:02,390 --> 02:00:04,850
principal of understanding what is

2318
02:00:04,850 --> 02:00:06,980
happening in the network then there is

2319
02:00:06,980 --> 02:00:08,480
different ways in which

2320
02:00:08,480 --> 02:00:10,310
we may be doing analysis

2321
02:00:10,310 --> 02:00:12,830
of traffic doing sniffing wards erc

2322
02:00:12,830 --> 02:00:15,200
It is one of the most famous tools

2323
02:00:15,200 --> 02:00:17,360
In its most basic sense this is a

2324
02:00:17,360 --> 02:00:19,040
tool that helps us understand

2325
02:00:19,040 --> 02:00:21,410
the data that is passing through

2326
02:00:21,410 --> 02:00:23,480
the net and that we caught

2327
02:00:23,480 --> 02:00:26,390
this is interpreted and presented as

2328
02:00:26,390 --> 02:00:27,710
let's say in packet forms

2329
02:00:27,710 --> 02:00:28,480
individual

2330
02:00:28,480 --> 02:00:31,310
and well something very very good about this

2331
02:00:31,310 --> 02:00:34,310
tool is that it is software that

2332
02:00:34,310 --> 02:00:37,489
helps us to be able to detect not only

2333
02:00:37,489 --> 02:00:39,800
packages but also anomalies or

2334
02:00:39,800 --> 02:00:42,820
assemble images executable files

2335
02:00:42,820 --> 02:00:46,340
and a lot of things don't

2336
02:00:46,340 --> 02:00:48,530
interesting is that this tool is

2337
02:00:48,530 --> 02:00:50,090
can use on different systems

2338
02:00:50,090 --> 02:00:52,420
operational here I put the three more

2339
02:00:52,420 --> 02:00:56,480
famous and the most I think that something that

2340
02:00:56,480 --> 02:00:57,680
we are all going to like it is that this

2341
02:00:57,680 --> 02:00:59,800
tool is completely free

2342
02:00:59,800 --> 02:01:02,540
Now when we talk about doing

2343
02:01:02,540 --> 02:01:04,610
traffic analysis we have to understand

2344
02:01:04,610 --> 02:01:06,830
that this is a very very tool

2345
02:01:06,830 --> 02:01:09,650
powerful with enough depth to

2346
02:01:09,650 --> 02:01:11,989
sometimes it can be a bit complex because

2347
02:01:11,989 --> 02:01:13,690
handles a large amount of information

2348
02:01:13,690 --> 02:01:16,360
so I always put this slide for

2349
02:01:16,360 --> 02:01:19,640
understand what is the best time to

2350
02:01:19,640 --> 02:01:21,770
use or to analyze

2351
02:01:21,770 --> 02:01:24,080
traffic packet analysis then

2352
02:01:24,080 --> 02:01:26,660
we have to know that before

2353
02:01:26,660 --> 02:01:28,640
start wards erc before you start

2354
02:01:28,640 --> 02:01:30,890
do this type of exercise

2355
02:01:30,890 --> 02:01:34,190
Well, basically understand when I would have

2356
02:01:34,190 --> 02:01:35,290
that i use this tool

2357
02:01:35,290 --> 02:01:38,480
Imagine if I want to install a lo

2358
02:01:38,480 --> 02:01:41,390
better a window in my house I need

2359
02:01:41,390 --> 02:01:42,890
the right tools to do

2360
02:01:42,890 --> 02:01:47,420
this not then when we by by

2361
02:01:47,420 --> 02:01:49,430
example when we want

2362
02:01:49,430 --> 02:01:51,640
understand the root cause of a problem

2363
02:01:51,640 --> 02:01:55,120
that we already know for example that

2364
02:01:55,120 --> 02:01:57,860
it is very different to say I want to understand

2365
02:01:57,860 --> 02:02:00,200
why the network is slow to be able to say

2366
02:02:00,200 --> 02:02:02,720
hey I want to know why when I access

2367
02:02:02,720 --> 02:02:05,200
this web page from this device

2368
02:02:05,200 --> 02:02:07,790
Well, I have some kind of let's say

2369
02:02:07,790 --> 02:02:10,850
disconnection or some retransmission is not

2370
02:02:10,850 --> 02:02:13,040
for example a very bad idea to use

2371
02:02:13,040 --> 02:02:15,830
wards erc if I want to make a diagram

2372
02:02:15,830 --> 02:02:17,420
Full network I'm going to have a great

2373
02:02:17,420 --> 02:02:20,270
number of packages no or inclusive then

2374
02:02:20,270 --> 02:02:23,180
to discover all the protocols that

2375
02:02:23,180 --> 02:02:24,800
exist and everything that is happening in the

2376
02:02:24,800 --> 02:02:27,410
network then yes out there to be able

2377
02:02:27,410 --> 02:02:29,690
be a little clearer

2378
02:02:29,690 --> 02:02:32,000
when we use guardian

2379
02:02:32,000 --> 02:02:33,770
guardian who is an ideal tool

2380
02:02:33,770 --> 02:02:36,110
To determine the root cause of a

2381
02:02:36,110 --> 02:02:38,720
problem that we already understand and

2382
02:02:38,720 --> 02:02:39,620
this will help us filter

2383
02:02:39,620 --> 02:02:41,270
information and to search

2384
02:02:41,270 --> 02:02:44,120
correct what is happening no and so

2385
02:02:44,120 --> 02:02:47,780
until here generally they arise

2386
02:02:47,780 --> 02:02:50,090
different questions for example how

2387
02:02:50,090 --> 02:02:52,640
does this tool guard cert work

2388
02:02:52,640 --> 02:02:54,890
comes with different drivers that

2389
02:02:54,890 --> 02:02:57,500
allow your network interface to either

2390
02:02:57,500 --> 02:02:59,600
your interface where we connect the cable

2391
02:02:59,600 --> 02:03:01,700
interface where we receive the signal

2392
02:03:01,700 --> 02:03:04,940
of the wireless wireless and puts itself in

2393
02:03:04,940 --> 02:03:07,400
promiscuous mode, that is, it begins to power

2394
02:03:07,400 --> 02:03:10,610
capture information not to be able to do

2395
02:03:10,610 --> 02:03:12,680
this we need to have and it's good

2396
02:03:12,680 --> 02:03:14,540
important to have privileges

2397
02:03:14,540 --> 02:03:15,160
administrator

2398
02:03:15,160 --> 02:03:17,210
in order to capture let's say the

2399
02:03:17,210 --> 02:03:19,310
information there are three processes in which

2400
02:03:19,310 --> 02:03:21,740
which this tool works

2401
02:03:21,740 --> 02:03:23,260
first is

2402
02:03:23,260 --> 02:03:25,970
collect information convert this

2403
02:03:25,970 --> 02:03:28,280
information and then analyze it to be able

2404
02:03:28,280 --> 02:03:29,960
shred everything you have lying around

2405
02:03:29,960 --> 02:03:32,510
let's go on each and every one of them

2406
02:03:32,510 --> 02:03:35,560
to more or less get the context

2407
02:03:35,560 --> 02:03:38,020
step is where I choose an interface

2408
02:03:38,020 --> 02:03:39,870
Where do I get the information?

2409
02:03:39,870 --> 02:03:42,250
I begin to listen inside that

2410
02:03:42,250 --> 02:03:43,960
interface that interests me

2411
02:03:43,960 --> 02:03:46,030
example connect it to a switch or

2412
02:03:46,030 --> 02:03:47,530
towards some wireless network that I

2413
02:03:47,530 --> 02:03:49,420
Interested and that's where I'm going to start

2414
02:03:49,420 --> 02:03:51,790
to connect this information once

2415
02:03:51,790 --> 02:03:53,350
collected this information through

2416
02:03:53,350 --> 02:03:55,420
internet of my interface what follows is

2417
02:03:55,420 --> 02:03:58,540
convert this information to be able

2418
02:03:58,540 --> 02:04:01,510
increase let's say the readability of the

2419
02:04:01,510 --> 02:04:04,060
binary data they collect or in which

2420
02:04:04,060 --> 02:04:05,680
network packets can be converted

2421
02:04:05,680 --> 02:04:08,860
through then in this case wards erc a

2422
02:04:08,860 --> 02:04:10,870
very very simple formats and later

2423
02:04:10,870 --> 02:04:12,820
I'm going to show you a little bit how it looks

2424
02:04:12,820 --> 02:04:15,190
this is not for the purpose of power

2425
02:04:15,190 --> 02:04:17,290
understand the information that I am

2426
02:04:17,290 --> 02:04:20,020
collecting and being able to pillar it' inclusive

2427
02:04:20,020 --> 02:04:22,240
in standards such as the model or

2428
02:04:22,240 --> 02:04:23,329
but

2429
02:04:23,329 --> 02:04:25,339
once I have this information

2430
02:04:25,339 --> 02:04:27,800
uan action allows us to analyze

2431
02:04:27,800 --> 02:04:30,169
this in a panel or graphical interface very

2432
02:04:30,169 --> 02:04:32,749
very easy to see protocols

2433
02:04:32,749 --> 02:04:34,849
settings and now so you can

2434
02:04:34,849 --> 02:04:36,679
reset analyze all traffic going

2435
02:04:36,679 --> 02:04:38,780
what is going through the network

2436
02:04:38,780 --> 02:04:41,149
these are the three points in which

2437
02:04:41,149 --> 02:04:44,479
Let's say we work with with wards erc without

2438
02:04:44,479 --> 02:04:46,369
However, and this is where many times

2439
02:04:46,369 --> 02:04:49,280
we begin to see how the challenges

2440
02:04:49,280 --> 02:04:52,699
specific let's say that and here we go

2441
02:04:52,699 --> 02:04:55,459
a very very quick example once i

2442
02:04:55,459 --> 02:04:58,939
I open save inside my computer I go

2443
02:04:58,939 --> 02:05:00,949
to see a lot of information

2444
02:05:00,949 --> 02:05:03,079
I'm going to see many that I'm going to see you

2445
02:05:03,079 --> 02:05:05,359
enough data out there that

2446
02:05:05,359 --> 02:05:07,339
they will surely appear overwhelming

2447
02:05:07,339 --> 02:05:09,800
It could even be how I will be able to and

2448
02:05:09,800 --> 02:05:10,849
This is one of the questions that always

2449
02:05:10,849 --> 02:05:13,039
they make us or how do I start to do

2450
02:05:13,039 --> 02:05:16,729
traffic analysis if I have a large

2451
02:05:16,729 --> 02:05:19,429
number of packages no this I think not

2452
02:05:19,429 --> 02:05:21,800
lasted more than 10 minutes and I have

2453
02:05:21,800 --> 02:05:24,140
immensity of traffic

2454
02:05:24,140 --> 02:05:26,720
and the first thing to know is that

2455
02:05:26,720 --> 02:05:29,720
walter allows us out there inclusive and

2456
02:05:29,720 --> 02:05:31,670
I'm going to do a little bit here generate

2457
02:05:31,670 --> 02:05:33,500
different profiles we can do this

2458
02:05:33,500 --> 02:05:36,170
modify to our liking then a

2459
02:05:36,170 --> 02:05:38,300
of the things we have to keep in mind

2460
02:05:38,300 --> 02:05:40,310
mind is what I'm going to do

2461
02:05:40,310 --> 02:05:42,650
What is the type of information that comes

2462
02:05:42,650 --> 02:05:44,750
inside my guard profile and what

2463
02:05:44,750 --> 02:05:47,150
that I need to look for it when we

2464
02:05:47,150 --> 02:05:49,100
we see a good profile to be from

2465
02:05:49,100 --> 02:05:51,620
let's say default way let's see

2466
02:05:51,620 --> 02:05:54,620
something like this not the number of the

2467
02:05:54,620 --> 02:05:57,950
packet the time the origin the destination

2468
02:05:57,950 --> 02:06:00,530
protocols and so on but what we

2469
02:06:00,530 --> 02:06:02,060
we want to search when we are going to do

2470
02:06:02,060 --> 02:06:05,350
traffic analysis is basically

2471
02:06:05,350 --> 02:06:07,820
what I put out there in green color no

2472
02:06:07,820 --> 02:06:10,490
we will need the date and time

2473
02:06:10,490 --> 02:06:12,190
in a format that is universal

2474
02:06:12,190 --> 02:06:14,570
we also need to have the address

2475
02:06:14,570 --> 02:06:16,360
source ip and destination ip address

2476
02:06:16,360 --> 02:06:18,800
also the origin ports and ports

2477
02:06:18,800 --> 02:06:20,870
destiny and well who are the

2478
02:06:20,870 --> 02:06:23,000
house or the servers to which

2479
02:06:23,000 --> 02:06:24,650
we are going to be analyzing

2480
02:06:24,650 --> 02:06:26,239
accessing not

2481
02:06:26,239 --> 02:06:30,440
This is from the let's say the lover video

2482
02:06:30,440 --> 02:06:31,489
of what we are going to be doing

2483
02:06:31,489 --> 02:06:33,829
during this session and those are the

2484
02:06:33,829 --> 02:06:36,829
four points of the face first we are going to

2485
02:06:36,829 --> 02:06:38,960
make a sector of a guard profile

2486
02:06:38,960 --> 02:06:41,869
to do network forensics 3 haunting

2487
02:06:41,869 --> 02:06:43,579
or make analysis, let's say, on issues of

2488
02:06:43,579 --> 02:06:45,619
cybersecurity let's talk a little

2489
02:06:45,619 --> 02:06:48,429
also about how to generate filters

2490
02:06:48,429 --> 02:06:50,630
expressions or even good post

2491
02:06:50,630 --> 02:06:52,489
different things that will help us

2492
02:06:52,489 --> 02:06:54,820
filter all information and also

2493
02:06:54,820 --> 02:06:57,769
to be able to find the traffic that I am

2494
02:06:57,769 --> 02:07:00,739
looking specifically for the third

2495
02:07:00,739 --> 02:07:02,449
point once we have this we go

2496
02:07:02,449 --> 02:07:04,969
to talk about how to identify users

2497
02:07:04,969 --> 02:07:08,030
eyes inside the network it is important that

2498
02:07:08,030 --> 02:07:09,739
once we find some kind of

2499
02:07:09,739 --> 02:07:12,349
anomaly malicious traffic distribution

2500
02:07:12,349 --> 02:07:13,909
of some file or artifact out there

2501
02:07:13,909 --> 02:07:16,130
malicious we can see where it was coming from

2502
02:07:16,130 --> 02:07:18,380
where does it go and if this is a device that

2503
02:07:18,380 --> 02:07:20,360
is within my network is a

2504
02:07:20,360 --> 02:07:22,610
let's say user who is inside me

2505
02:07:22,610 --> 02:07:24,139
domain controller power it

2506
02:07:24,139 --> 02:07:26,449
identify and be able to generate well

2507
02:07:26,449 --> 02:07:28,909
all analysis or all eradication

2508
02:07:28,909 --> 02:07:31,000
of the malware itself

2509
02:07:31,000 --> 02:07:33,970
and in the end since we already know a little bit

2510
02:07:33,970 --> 02:07:35,650
let's have the context of all this let's go

2511
02:07:35,650 --> 02:07:37,720
to do a couple of exercises on how

2512
02:07:37,720 --> 02:07:38,980
be able to do traffic analysis

2513
02:07:38,980 --> 02:07:41,800
malicious based on windows devices

2514
02:07:41,800 --> 02:07:44,650
with some of the campaigns, well, let's say

2515
02:07:44,650 --> 02:07:47,050
that we have seen in the last months or

2516
02:07:47,050 --> 02:07:49,030
years in Latin America just not

2517
02:07:49,030 --> 02:07:51,160
some will be word campaigns in others

2518
02:07:51,160 --> 02:07:52,720
are going to be malware distribution and

2519
02:07:52,720 --> 02:07:54,150
the rest

2520
02:07:54,150 --> 02:07:57,900
Well, well to start this that I'm going to

2521
02:07:57,900 --> 02:07:59,850
to ask please all this that I am going to you

2522
02:07:59,850 --> 02:08:01,890
to be showing is part of the

2523
02:08:01,890 --> 02:08:03,570
exercises that we give out there in the

2524
02:08:03,570 --> 02:08:06,060
university if you want to do

2525
02:08:06,060 --> 02:08:08,159
these exercises please find me at

2526
02:08:08,159 --> 02:08:10,590
my linkedin profile send my message

2527
02:08:10,590 --> 02:08:12,480
and I'm going to share all the captures

2528
02:08:12,480 --> 02:08:14,400
so that you can do this

2529
02:08:14,400 --> 02:08:18,060
let's say more calmly not now this

2530
02:08:18,060 --> 02:08:19,949
It's the lab's number one catch

2531
02:08:19,949 --> 02:08:22,980
that we see here that we can observe by

2532
02:08:22,980 --> 02:08:27,020
example we see http requests we see

2533
02:08:27,020 --> 02:08:29,460
some information in this in this

2534
02:08:29,460 --> 02:08:31,500
profile or in this image that I put

2535
02:08:31,500 --> 02:08:33,739
something we can see

2536
02:08:33,739 --> 02:08:36,199
specific is that all these requests

2537
02:08:36,199 --> 02:08:39,000
are filtered by this command that I

2538
02:08:39,000 --> 02:08:42,480
I put up here http dot request

2539
02:08:42,480 --> 02:08:44,699
however I will see different

2540
02:08:44,699 --> 02:08:46,710
problems in this profile this is the

2541
02:08:46,710 --> 02:08:48,870
default profile

2542
02:08:48,870 --> 02:08:50,909
The first thing I think is that in all

2543
02:08:50,909 --> 02:08:53,550
these http requests I can see the

2544
02:08:53,550 --> 02:08:55,679
the best place to be

2545
02:08:55,679 --> 02:08:57,870
Let's say accessing but I can't see the

2546
02:08:57,870 --> 02:08:59,670
mastery that maybe that's what I

2547
02:08:59,670 --> 02:09:02,040
Interested for further analysis

2548
02:09:02,040 --> 02:09:04,620
i can see the ip address but i can't

2549
02:09:04,620 --> 02:09:06,150
really see where you are

2550
02:09:06,150 --> 02:09:09,750
accessing now the profile that is about

2551
02:09:09,750 --> 02:09:11,340
default and this is one of the big ones

2552
02:09:11,340 --> 02:09:12,890
problems

2553
02:09:12,890 --> 02:09:15,660
makes me lose as an analyst of

2554
02:09:15,660 --> 02:09:17,880
seen many things no I don't have one

2555
02:09:17,880 --> 02:09:20,780
clear visibility what is happening no

2556
02:09:20,780 --> 02:09:22,740
precisely to the best and this is very

2557
02:09:22,740 --> 02:09:24,840
important to know what I'm looking for

2558
02:09:24,840 --> 02:09:26,970
to be able to generate, let's say, some of our own

2559
02:09:26,970 --> 02:09:29,280
stumbled upon an own custom profile

2560
02:09:29,280 --> 02:09:32,670
that I want to do not now that

2561
02:09:32,670 --> 02:09:34,950
we want to see and this is this would be the

2562
02:09:34,950 --> 02:09:37,290
first question not when I am

2563
02:09:37,290 --> 02:09:39,630
generating this guardiola profile

2564
02:09:39,630 --> 02:09:41,940
that I would love to see or that I would like

2565
02:09:41,940 --> 02:09:43,980
view would look something like this if any of

2566
02:09:43,980 --> 02:09:46,260
you have handled consoles to the best

2567
02:09:46,260 --> 02:09:48,450
of correlation firewalls worshipers of

2568
02:09:48,450 --> 02:09:50,280
events many times we have this

2569
02:09:50,280 --> 02:09:52,470
information and we can make it

2570
02:09:52,470 --> 02:09:54,900
save ourselves from all this we can

2571
02:09:54,900 --> 02:09:57,990
customize the one now to get to

2572
02:09:57,990 --> 02:10:00,060
This up to this point the first thing that

2573
02:10:00,060 --> 02:10:02,160
we would have to do are a series of

2574
02:10:02,160 --> 02:10:04,860
steps that we are going to go little by little this

2575
02:10:04,860 --> 02:10:06,959
can you do which one I want

2576
02:10:06,959 --> 02:10:08,669
capture do not necessarily have to

2577
02:10:08,669 --> 02:10:10,469
have this that I am using a

2578
02:10:10,469 --> 02:10:12,510
example, however, I invite you again

2579
02:10:12,510 --> 02:10:14,219
send me a message and I will

2580
02:10:14,219 --> 02:10:16,260
I share the captures so that

2581
02:10:16,260 --> 02:10:18,209
can you do this since i know about this

2582
02:10:18,209 --> 02:10:20,519
video no so what are we going to

2583
02:10:20,519 --> 02:10:22,619
do remove columns let's add

2584
02:10:22,619 --> 02:10:25,799
columns we are going to put the time

2585
02:10:25,799 --> 02:10:27,959
date and time that I need and we are going to

2586
02:10:27,959 --> 02:10:30,329
add custom columns let's

2587
02:10:30,329 --> 02:10:31,979
to be able to hide columns that maybe

2588
02:10:31,979 --> 02:10:34,530
that one needs and combine even the

2589
02:10:34,530 --> 02:10:36,209
value of certain columns this for

2590
02:10:36,209 --> 02:10:39,299
to be able to have a profile a little more for

2591
02:10:39,299 --> 02:10:42,059
so with increased visibility not now

2592
02:10:42,059 --> 02:10:44,869
for some people the first column

2593
02:10:44,869 --> 02:10:48,119
this column is usually removed without

2594
02:10:48,119 --> 02:10:51,780
However, and then I recommend that the

2595
02:10:51,780 --> 02:10:53,579
better maybe they escort him is not

2596
02:10:53,579 --> 02:10:56,819
you need to remove it to do this

2597
02:10:56,819 --> 02:10:58,829
all you need is to click

2598
02:10:58,829 --> 02:11:01,199
right and let's say to the column where

2599
02:11:01,199 --> 02:11:03,929
it says number and well you can put it

2600
02:11:03,929 --> 02:11:06,749
remove or if you click where where

2601
02:11:06,749 --> 02:11:08,549
says number for example in this part

2602
02:11:08,549 --> 02:11:10,849
who comes here only hides, no

2603
02:11:10,849 --> 02:11:13,200
that's the way we

2604
02:11:13,200 --> 02:11:15,990
we can start customizing add

2605
02:11:15,990 --> 02:11:18,420
remove columns inside my profile

2606
02:11:18,420 --> 02:11:22,740
wards erc to other people or many people

2607
02:11:22,740 --> 02:11:24,810
Let's say also remove the column that

2608
02:11:24,810 --> 02:11:26,790
says protocol or the column that says law

2609
02:11:26,790 --> 02:11:29,270
I will leave it there for your consideration.

2610
02:11:29,270 --> 02:11:31,980
but if they realize once that already

2611
02:11:31,980 --> 02:11:34,530
generated this I only kept the

2612
02:11:34,530 --> 02:11:36,510
time column and origin and

2613
02:11:36,510 --> 02:11:38,870
destination and also the information

2614
02:11:38,870 --> 02:11:41,910
Why remove it from the protocol and if it is

2615
02:11:41,910 --> 02:11:43,680
something that suddenly they ask us

2616
02:11:43,680 --> 02:11:46,530
what happens is that guard is about

2617
02:11:46,530 --> 02:11:48,300
analyze or try to guess what

2618
02:11:48,300 --> 02:11:50,880
protocol is through the flow of the

2619
02:11:50,880 --> 02:11:52,890
information then often

2620
02:11:52,890 --> 02:11:55,170
try to remove later let's

2621
02:11:55,170 --> 02:11:57,690
add another type of columns

2622
02:11:57,690 --> 02:11:59,370
that they will be able to help us to see what

2623
02:11:59,370 --> 02:12:01,320
protocol type what port is it

2624
02:12:01,320 --> 02:12:03,180
specifically and is and so we can

2625
02:12:03,180 --> 02:12:05,280
will help to understand a little what

2626
02:12:05,280 --> 02:12:08,450
is happening not the one that says elect

2627
02:12:08,450 --> 02:12:11,250
basically it is the size of the packet per

2628
02:12:11,250 --> 02:12:13,530
timing is not important as we go

2629
02:12:13,530 --> 02:12:15,270
to analyze very very specific traffic

2630
02:12:15,270 --> 02:12:17,610
then they can hide it or remove it

2631
02:12:17,610 --> 02:12:20,219
there are no cases where

2632
02:12:20,219 --> 02:12:22,440
if you can be seeing what is

2633
02:12:22,440 --> 02:12:24,929
begin to transmit images within

2634
02:12:24,929 --> 02:12:26,789
the network and suddenly the images very very

2635
02:12:26,789 --> 02:12:28,710
heavy many times these images

2636
02:12:28,710 --> 02:12:31,679
they can bring something around embedded and

2637
02:12:31,679 --> 02:12:33,809
well that is an indicator of what it is

2638
02:12:33,809 --> 02:12:35,969
what could be happening no if i know

2639
02:12:35,969 --> 02:12:37,519
modify a file or something else

2640
02:12:37,519 --> 02:12:40,590
but well continuing with this point already

2641
02:12:40,590 --> 02:12:43,289
We already removed the columns, this is not it

2642
02:12:43,289 --> 02:12:45,329
something very simple then let's go

2643
02:12:45,329 --> 02:12:47,699
step by step as I had told you and

2644
02:12:47,699 --> 02:12:50,760
now the next part let's start

2645
02:12:50,760 --> 02:12:52,979
and I passed it a little fast let's go

2646
02:12:52,979 --> 02:12:55,199
add columns to do this

2647
02:12:55,199 --> 02:12:57,510
All I have to do is give it

2648
02:12:57,510 --> 02:13:00,059
right click in this case to the part of

2649
02:13:00,059 --> 02:13:02,550
the columns and here it basically comes

2650
02:13:02,550 --> 02:13:04,650
column preferences this is where

2651
02:13:04,650 --> 02:13:07,550
I have to click

2652
02:13:07,550 --> 02:13:10,370
when you explain this part

2653
02:13:10,370 --> 02:13:12,860
a menu like this is going to come out okay

2654
02:13:12,860 --> 02:13:15,230
here we are going to give the columns that already

2655
02:13:15,230 --> 02:13:17,180
we have enabled here the advantage is

2656
02:13:17,180 --> 02:13:19,670
that I can customize everything I go

2657
02:13:19,670 --> 02:13:21,980
to be able to put there not then here

2658
02:13:21,980 --> 02:13:23,900
is where it gets interesting because

2659
02:13:23,900 --> 02:13:25,700
we can add one

2660
02:13:25,700 --> 02:13:27,440
new column with parameters that i

2661
02:13:27,440 --> 02:13:29,630
I want you to save go show me now

2662
02:13:29,630 --> 02:13:33,290
to add a new column what

2663
02:13:33,290 --> 02:13:35,510
I basically have to give it

2664
02:13:35,510 --> 02:13:37,940
click this button to the plus symbol and the

2665
02:13:37,940 --> 02:13:39,710
pressing it will add a new one

2666
02:13:39,710 --> 02:13:42,020
column something like this which is here

2667
02:13:42,020 --> 02:13:42,940
not

2668
02:13:42,940 --> 02:13:45,980
since you have all this here is where you

2669
02:13:45,980 --> 02:13:47,870
we are going to give the name to the column if

2670
02:13:47,870 --> 02:13:50,120
I double click it, I can put it in

2671
02:13:50,120 --> 02:13:52,670
this source port case here as what

2672
02:13:52,670 --> 02:13:54,590
I put on the screen and here I can

2673
02:13:54,590 --> 02:13:56,710
also choose what type of information

2674
02:13:56,710 --> 02:14:00,070
i want you to be showing me warzel no

2675
02:14:00,070 --> 02:14:02,290
we will be able to read to you, for example, that we

2676
02:14:02,290 --> 02:14:05,140
show some kind of oxford numbers or

2677
02:14:05,140 --> 02:14:06,820
something like that then you

2678
02:14:06,820 --> 02:14:08,890
You can see out there that once I already

2679
02:14:08,890 --> 02:14:10,750
I start to put it even I can

2680
02:14:10,750 --> 02:14:13,180
move to make it a little bit well

2681
02:14:13,180 --> 02:14:15,430
accommodated where I want not then

2682
02:14:15,430 --> 02:14:17,350
and they realize right now I already have the

2683
02:14:17,350 --> 02:14:20,830
part that says east port of origin and

2684
02:14:20,830 --> 02:14:23,350
mobile near where it says the origin ip

2685
02:14:23,350 --> 02:14:24,910
no then here you can

2686
02:14:24,910 --> 02:14:27,390
rearrange it as you better

2687
02:14:27,390 --> 02:14:29,620
seem

2688
02:14:29,620 --> 02:14:31,810
now having a little this type

2689
02:14:31,810 --> 02:14:34,090
of information I can generate in this

2690
02:14:34,090 --> 02:14:36,850
case the source ip then the source port

2691
02:14:36,850 --> 02:14:39,070
then the destination ip and then the port

2692
02:14:39,070 --> 02:14:41,380
destiny and this is where it becomes already a

2693
02:14:41,380 --> 02:14:44,440
little more interesting this point and today

2694
02:14:44,440 --> 02:14:46,300
I start building my war profile

2695
02:14:46,300 --> 02:14:48,210
share so you can give me information

2696
02:14:48,210 --> 02:14:52,060
very specific to the source port and the

2697
02:14:52,060 --> 02:14:54,550
destination port then my profile goes

2698
02:14:54,550 --> 02:14:56,230
showing a little more information

2699
02:14:56,230 --> 02:14:59,140
as I was now seeing way

2700
02:14:59,140 --> 02:15:01,870
very quickly this we see that they are not well

2701
02:15:01,870 --> 02:15:04,120
aligned the columns this can be done

2702
02:15:04,120 --> 02:15:06,790
modify the same is totally your

2703
02:15:06,790 --> 02:15:08,230
preferably I do it so that it can be seen

2704
02:15:08,230 --> 02:15:10,480
a little more better accommodated we can

2705
02:15:10,480 --> 02:15:11,880
align this to the left

2706
02:15:11,880 --> 02:15:13,900
we just have to right click

2707
02:15:13,900 --> 02:15:16,570
whatever columns I need

2708
02:15:16,570 --> 02:15:18,940
and then once this happens I'm going to

2709
02:15:18,940 --> 02:15:20,800
put align to the left and

2710
02:15:20,800 --> 02:15:22,150
sent to accommodate all this information

2711
02:15:22,150 --> 02:15:25,450
no then we see that well let's say the

2712
02:15:25,450 --> 02:15:27,720
profile looks a little better no

2713
02:15:27,720 --> 02:15:30,760
to be able to generate the time part

2714
02:15:30,760 --> 02:15:32,890
We can now remove and add columns

2715
02:15:32,890 --> 02:15:36,510
So what do I need for this?

2716
02:15:36,510 --> 02:15:39,430
basically we are going to use a format

2717
02:15:39,430 --> 02:15:41,110
which is used almost everywhere in the world

2718
02:15:41,110 --> 02:15:43,060
and it helps us to be able to say

2719
02:15:43,060 --> 02:15:45,130
measure well the time labels

2720
02:15:45,130 --> 02:15:47,230
timestamp of each packet in a format

2721
02:15:47,230 --> 02:15:49,780
generic this is very very important

2722
02:15:49,780 --> 02:15:52,050
because it also allows us to be able

2723
02:15:52,050 --> 02:15:54,340
share information in a format

2724
02:15:54,340 --> 02:15:56,140
that we all can in this case

2725
02:15:56,140 --> 02:15:58,210
use it the way to do this is

2726
02:15:58,210 --> 02:16:00,700
very simple in the saw part in the

2727
02:16:00,700 --> 02:16:03,040
menu that comes up we can see

2728
02:16:03,040 --> 02:16:05,860
the part that says time display format

2729
02:16:05,860 --> 02:16:07,810
and basically we are going to choose this

2730
02:16:07,810 --> 02:16:10,119
that says the sign and add the seconds

2731
02:16:10,119 --> 02:16:12,909
instead of automatic this would be the

2732
02:16:12,909 --> 02:16:14,739
way in which I'm going to see and

2733
02:16:14,739 --> 02:16:16,600
pay close attention to the column that says

2734
02:16:16,600 --> 02:16:17,949
here time coming up left

2735
02:16:17,949 --> 02:16:21,070
once i set this up i will

2736
02:16:21,070 --> 02:16:23,440
look like the column now yes with the date

2737
02:16:23,440 --> 02:16:27,100
of the year I think it is month day and well

2738
02:16:27,100 --> 02:16:29,590
here the specific time appears so I

2739
02:16:29,590 --> 02:16:31,840
I can be plotting for example what

2740
02:16:31,840 --> 02:16:33,968
so much time passes from one package to another

2741
02:16:33,968 --> 02:16:36,728
not if there is some kind of retransmission

2742
02:16:36,728 --> 02:16:39,129
or even how long the conversation lasts

2743
02:16:39,129 --> 02:16:40,990
between two right then there I'll go

2744
02:16:40,990 --> 02:16:43,478
to have a little more data and

2745
02:16:43,478 --> 02:16:45,308
even then also being able to make a

2746
02:16:45,308 --> 02:16:47,740
time-based traceability voyage

2747
02:16:47,740 --> 02:16:49,929
which is also very important

2748
02:16:49,929 --> 02:16:53,290
many times when we receive

2749
02:16:53,290 --> 02:16:56,170
this type of traffic signs also

2750
02:16:56,170 --> 02:16:58,450
It is very good to do all this because if

2751
02:16:58,450 --> 02:17:00,129
I have them in different points of the

2752
02:17:00,129 --> 02:17:02,290
network because I can also continue there a

2753
02:17:02,290 --> 02:17:03,820
little traceability of what is what

2754
02:17:03,820 --> 02:17:06,080
is happening and put together my puzzle

2755
02:17:06,080 --> 02:17:09,620
and now that we have time in a

2756
02:17:09,620 --> 02:17:11,929
format, let's say more understandable and

2757
02:17:11,929 --> 02:17:14,750
generic more specific what follows is

2758
02:17:14,750 --> 02:17:17,090
add custom columns and let's

2759
02:17:17,090 --> 02:17:19,400
add petition names by

2760
02:17:19,400 --> 02:17:23,599
example of http and https not for this in

2761
02:17:23,599 --> 02:17:26,959
our first capture with the filter and

2762
02:17:26,959 --> 02:17:29,870
we are going to use the filter that says http

2763
02:17:29,870 --> 02:17:32,150
request we are going to take the first packet

2764
02:17:32,150 --> 02:17:34,490
and this can be for any package

2765
02:17:34,490 --> 02:17:36,080
It doesn't matter if you are doing it in your

2766
02:17:36,080 --> 02:17:38,468
house with a catch you have lying around

2767
02:17:38,468 --> 02:17:41,480
law, the ideal is to have a request for

2768
02:17:41,480 --> 02:17:44,209
http then let's take a packet from http

2769
02:17:44,209 --> 02:17:47,360
We are going to go to the details panel of the

2770
02:17:47,360 --> 02:17:48,950
What is this package that comes down here?

2771
02:17:48,950 --> 02:17:51,679
and let's see something that albert rate says

2772
02:17:51,679 --> 02:17:54,770
transfer protocol is not something very

2773
02:17:54,770 --> 02:17:57,888
interesting in this and it is something that

2774
02:17:57,888 --> 02:17:59,510
I always tell my students when

2775
02:17:59,510 --> 02:18:02,540
We started to see network issues the best

2776
02:18:02,540 --> 02:18:04,099
way in which we can

2777
02:18:04,099 --> 02:18:06,138
understand the model or yes and see it in

2778
02:18:06,138 --> 02:18:09,138
action from its physical layer layer 1 layer

2779
02:18:09,138 --> 02:18:11,450
2 layer 3 blah blah blah is viewing the panel

2780
02:18:11,450 --> 02:18:13,780
of whatsapp packages here we can see

2781
02:18:13,780 --> 02:18:16,400
all the layers of the model or yes and let's go

2782
02:18:16,400 --> 02:18:17,780
to understand a little where it can be

2783
02:18:17,780 --> 02:18:20,209
the failure or where all the

2784
02:18:20,209 --> 02:18:23,150
packages no then here we will see in

2785
02:18:23,150 --> 02:18:27,469
http and we will also see the

2786
02:18:27,469 --> 02:18:29,930
information that says host and we are going to

2787
02:18:29,930 --> 02:18:32,480
right click and we are going to put it

2788
02:18:32,480 --> 02:18:35,000
add as column or apply as

2789
02:18:35,000 --> 02:18:37,879
column this is a very simple way

2790
02:18:37,879 --> 02:18:40,400
to be able to see any kind of

2791
02:18:40,400 --> 02:18:42,320
information that exists, say, in a

2792
02:18:42,320 --> 02:18:44,690
capture of guard traffic and be able to

2793
02:18:44,690 --> 02:18:46,520
add as a column if I'm interested

2794
02:18:46,520 --> 02:18:48,980
So if I want to know what is the

2795
02:18:48,980 --> 02:18:51,440
let's say host of the page where it is

2796
02:18:51,440 --> 02:18:53,540
accessing by http this is the way

2797
02:18:53,540 --> 02:18:55,850
easier not once you click

2798
02:18:55,850 --> 02:18:58,040
it will seem to me and let's say my column

2799
02:18:58,040 --> 02:19:00,410
of host and I will be able to have an idea of ​​the

2800
02:19:00,410 --> 02:19:02,510
no http traffic then i can already see

2801
02:19:02,510 --> 02:19:05,450
the url and this already begins to see a

2802
02:19:05,450 --> 02:19:08,059
little better, it doesn't look so complicated anymore

2803
02:19:08,059 --> 02:19:10,219
no, however we still have

2804
02:19:10,219 --> 02:19:12,860
problems since much of the traffic that

2805
02:19:12,860 --> 02:19:15,799
we see in the way of real life well

2806
02:19:15,799 --> 02:19:18,620
basically or surely does not see by http

2807
02:19:18,620 --> 02:19:21,200
yes we are not going to see much encrypted traffic

2808
02:19:21,200 --> 02:19:25,190
by https lts etcetera etcetera then

2809
02:19:25,190 --> 02:19:27,380
it is important to be able to find the name

2810
02:19:27,380 --> 02:19:30,430
of the server in this case of https

2811
02:19:30,430 --> 02:19:32,870
So we're going to have to win a little

2812
02:19:32,870 --> 02:19:35,930
more and this is very very interesting because

2813
02:19:35,930 --> 02:19:37,940
if we can't see this

2814
02:19:37,940 --> 02:19:40,250
information there will be a lot of traffic that

2815
02:19:40,250 --> 02:19:41,600
we will be able to be leaving no

2816
02:19:41,600 --> 02:19:43,150
including malicious traffic

2817
02:19:43,150 --> 02:19:47,389
Now for this we are going to generate a

2818
02:19:47,389 --> 02:19:49,250
traffic we are going to put a filter that is

2819
02:19:49,250 --> 02:19:52,641
says tlc punto game psych punto type

2820
02:19:52,641 --> 02:19:54,681
equal equal one these are flags of

2821
02:19:54,681 --> 02:19:56,780
tcp focused on t l s

2822
02:19:56,780 --> 02:19:59,261
this will depend and here I put both

2823
02:19:59,261 --> 02:20:02,960
let's say command or filter will

2824
02:20:02,960 --> 02:20:04,940
depend on the latest version of wasser

2825
02:20:04,940 --> 02:20:06,650
that you have if you have guards that

2826
02:20:06,650 --> 02:20:08,660
in its latest version more usable than

2827
02:20:08,660 --> 02:20:10,400
I am the one that I added out there, not the one

2828
02:20:10,400 --> 02:20:12,650
from TV I know if you have guard be of that

2829
02:20:12,650 --> 02:20:14,000
updated because you have it in a

2830
02:20:14,000 --> 02:20:15,830
virtual machine in an environment

2831
02:20:15,830 --> 02:20:18,110
laboratory also uses the first

2832
02:20:18,110 --> 02:20:21,021
filter that is that is the g spot itself no

2833
02:20:21,021 --> 02:20:23,421
and here what it is going to show us is that

2834
02:20:23,421 --> 02:20:26,001
we are going to filter all the packets that

2835
02:20:26,001 --> 02:20:29,780
go for that cl or tele s and we'll see

2836
02:20:29,780 --> 02:20:32,181
all packages hello this is the

2837
02:20:32,181 --> 02:20:34,190
flag or the number 1 that appears on

2838
02:20:34,190 --> 02:20:36,891
there in the filter now if we

2839
02:20:36,891 --> 02:20:39,530
we begin to see where it says host no longer

2840
02:20:39,530 --> 02:20:41,381
I see the domain I don't see any packages anymore

2841
02:20:41,381 --> 02:20:44,330
then the intention of after power

2842
02:20:44,330 --> 02:20:46,971
therefore generate the necessary filters to

2843
02:20:46,971 --> 02:20:49,851
to be able to see the package of or to be able to

2844
02:20:49,851 --> 02:20:51,410
see where you are wanting

2845
02:20:51,410 --> 02:20:54,311
communicate

2846
02:20:54,630 --> 02:20:57,390
now let's take whatever package goes

2847
02:20:57,390 --> 02:21:01,670
by ss elliot ls and we're off to go and here

2848
02:21:01,670 --> 02:21:06,240
basically I do quite a lot let's say like

2849
02:21:06,240 --> 02:21:08,820
remarks inside the capture but I'm going

2850
02:21:08,820 --> 02:21:10,890
to take the first package and what am I going to

2851
02:21:10,890 --> 02:21:13,350
basically do is go to the layer of

2852
02:21:13,350 --> 02:21:16,050
tele that not the application layer here

2853
02:21:16,050 --> 02:21:18,990
precisely what follows is that when

2854
02:21:18,990 --> 02:21:21,149
we click or expand study that says

2855
02:21:21,149 --> 02:21:23,939
transport that tweet and let's see all

2856
02:21:23,939 --> 02:21:25,710
the information that is shared when

2857
02:21:25,710 --> 02:21:27,330
does let's say this deal

2858
02:21:27,330 --> 02:21:29,189
certified key exchanges and

2859
02:21:29,189 --> 02:21:31,800
enough information not to saw power

2860
02:21:31,800 --> 02:21:34,350
see or find where you are

2861
02:21:34,350 --> 02:21:36,420
connecting this I'm going to have to expand

2862
02:21:36,420 --> 02:21:41,820
Well, in the part that says tlc uve 1.2

2863
02:21:41,820 --> 02:21:43,979
then I'm going to have to go to the part

2864
02:21:43,979 --> 02:21:45,840
what does game psych protocol say to see

2865
02:21:45,840 --> 02:21:47,810
when it is done is let's say this

2866
02:21:47,810 --> 02:21:50,520
exchange we will also go to the

2867
02:21:50,520 --> 02:21:53,490
part that says extender server name this

2868
02:21:53,490 --> 02:21:55,080
It's going to help me see what kind of

2869
02:21:55,080 --> 02:21:56,820
information began to be exchanged

2870
02:21:56,820 --> 02:21:59,670
when did all this exchange take place

2871
02:21:59,670 --> 02:22:02,010
this let's say connection between the

2872
02:22:02,010 --> 02:22:04,950
and we will also see the name of the

2873
02:22:04,950 --> 02:22:06,720
extension and this will allow us

2874
02:22:06,720 --> 02:22:08,930
get to server name no

2875
02:22:08,930 --> 02:22:11,880
basically this is where you are

2876
02:22:11,880 --> 02:22:14,760
signing the certificate that it claims to be and

2877
02:22:14,760 --> 02:22:16,080
this can also help us to give ourselves

2878
02:22:16,080 --> 02:22:17,760
an idea where you are communicating

2879
02:22:17,760 --> 02:22:21,000
let's say the device the house or the

2880
02:22:21,000 --> 02:22:23,399
windows machine not so here I already

2881
02:22:23,399 --> 02:22:26,430
I start to see what is let's say the host

2882
02:22:26,430 --> 02:22:29,220
name and where they are connecting and

2883
02:22:29,220 --> 02:22:31,500
as you can imagine the idea is

2884
02:22:31,500 --> 02:22:33,899
put it in a column not only

2885
02:22:33,899 --> 02:22:35,700
I have to right click where

2886
02:22:35,700 --> 02:22:38,819
it says server name apply as column and

2887
02:22:38,819 --> 02:22:40,920
it will automatically be generated there

2888
02:22:40,920 --> 02:22:43,649
nothing more to make a rich because

2889
02:22:43,649 --> 02:22:46,020
then they get a little mixed up in this one

2890
02:22:46,020 --> 02:22:48,090
point I'm going to take a package that says

2891
02:22:48,090 --> 02:22:50,310
This is the iese and I am going to expand the part

2892
02:22:50,310 --> 02:22:52,979
What does the record layer of weeks say I'm leaving

2893
02:22:52,979 --> 02:22:54,870
to also expand the part that this game

2894
02:22:54,870 --> 02:22:58,140
it protocol and then after I'm going to

2895
02:22:58,140 --> 02:23:00,029
expand the part that says extension

2896
02:23:00,029 --> 02:23:02,430
server name and then I'm going to see the

2897
02:23:02,430 --> 02:23:04,500
part that says server name and here I go to

2898
02:23:04,500 --> 02:23:06,779
find already in this case the hosting to the

2899
02:23:06,779 --> 02:23:09,090
that I have to add I do not give this

2900
02:23:09,090 --> 02:23:10,979
right click I put apply as

2901
02:23:10,979 --> 02:23:14,370
column and automatically I will already have

2902
02:23:14,370 --> 02:23:17,520
the server name no longer have this this

2903
02:23:17,520 --> 02:23:19,979
column that appears out there this column

2904
02:23:19,979 --> 02:23:21,359
returns the name of the server

2905
02:23:21,359 --> 02:23:24,479
we can see the url of let's say one

2906
02:23:24,479 --> 02:23:27,540
request that goes by https or by 443

2907
02:23:27,540 --> 02:23:29,430
So now I see a little more than

2908
02:23:29,430 --> 02:23:30,989
information and it is already clearer for me

2909
02:23:30,989 --> 02:23:33,630
understand where you are connecting to

2910
02:23:33,630 --> 02:23:36,390
this server go by http or go by

2911
02:23:36,390 --> 02:23:40,470
https and now many times when

2912
02:23:40,470 --> 02:23:42,600
analyzes malicious traffic in an environment

2913
02:23:42,600 --> 02:23:44,580
laboratory controlled some

2914
02:23:44,580 --> 02:23:46,260
columns may stop doing

2915
02:23:46,260 --> 02:23:50,189
sense not in this specific case can

2916
02:23:50,189 --> 02:23:52,350
that we are not interested in seeing the source IP and

2917
02:23:52,350 --> 02:23:55,739
this is totally optional no so

2918
02:23:55,739 --> 02:23:58,560
if I am, for example, I have one

2919
02:23:58,560 --> 02:24:00,420
machine in a controlled environment I have

2920
02:24:00,420 --> 02:24:01,979
a sandbox I know my source IP

2921
02:24:01,979 --> 02:24:03,750
always going to be the same and this to

2922
02:24:03,750 --> 02:24:06,060
better people could remove it already very

2923
02:24:06,060 --> 02:24:07,949
very experienced and what does this guy do

2924
02:24:07,949 --> 02:24:09,870
of analysis generally removes this

2925
02:24:09,870 --> 02:24:12,290
not this column

2926
02:24:12,290 --> 02:24:14,870
also many times the port many

2927
02:24:14,870 --> 02:24:16,670
sometimes the source port does not have as much

2928
02:24:16,670 --> 02:24:18,890
sense because when the

2929
02:24:18,890 --> 02:24:20,960
csp communications most

2930
02:24:20,960 --> 02:24:23,570
times are let's say they are used by those

2931
02:24:23,570 --> 02:24:25,521
randomized ports to me what I

2932
02:24:25,521 --> 02:24:27,560
interested would probably be more the

2933
02:24:27,560 --> 02:24:29,720
destination ip and destination port no

2934
02:24:29,720 --> 02:24:32,420
so to do this I can give you

2935
02:24:32,420 --> 02:24:35,630
click on these let's say two columns and

2936
02:24:35,630 --> 02:24:37,340
I can disable them simple and

2937
02:24:37,340 --> 02:24:39,320
simply by taking away the

2938
02:24:39,320 --> 02:24:42,680
popcorn I will not repeat it again this is

2939
02:24:42,680 --> 02:24:44,930
totally optional and when you

2940
02:24:44,930 --> 02:24:46,850
If you want to use it, just click on it

2941
02:24:46,850 --> 02:24:49,250
right and you can add the ones from there

2942
02:24:49,250 --> 02:24:52,200
columns that are disabled do not

2943
02:24:52,200 --> 02:24:54,931
now that we can see the games

2944
02:24:54,931 --> 02:24:59,190
http in the https server names we can

2945
02:24:59,190 --> 02:25:01,260
optimize our profile a little more

2946
02:25:01,260 --> 02:25:03,420
that is, we can combine the columns

2947
02:25:03,420 --> 02:25:05,641
what it says in http and what server says

2948
02:25:05,641 --> 02:25:09,480
name those of https in a single one and this

2949
02:25:09,480 --> 02:25:11,130
it will be able to help to have enough

2950
02:25:11,130 --> 02:25:13,160
information is worth

2951
02:25:13,160 --> 02:25:16,380
what is the idea of ​​organizing a little

2952
02:25:16,380 --> 02:25:18,300
the profile for this we are going to have

2953
02:25:18,300 --> 02:25:20,940
our preferences panel and columns

2954
02:25:20,940 --> 02:25:23,880
We are going to right click and do it

2955
02:25:23,880 --> 02:25:26,090
What are we basically going to do if we

2956
02:25:26,090 --> 02:25:29,190
Press swing and let's see one

2957
02:25:29,190 --> 02:25:32,040
screen like this not here we go

2958
02:25:32,040 --> 02:25:34,080
change the column that says host and

2959
02:25:34,080 --> 02:25:37,470
add to it, let's say the filter that

2960
02:25:37,470 --> 02:25:39,420
says server name that is to say the one that says a

2961
02:25:39,420 --> 02:25:41,910
TV that point people no so let's go

2962
02:25:41,910 --> 02:25:44,400
take this information and we will generate

2963
02:25:44,400 --> 02:25:46,710
Let's say this filter that comes over here

2964
02:25:46,710 --> 02:25:49,650
It's not let's say this is what you

2965
02:25:49,650 --> 02:25:52,590
they would put where it says let's say the

2966
02:25:52,590 --> 02:25:55,260
fields I'm going to tell him give me the hold

2967
02:25:55,260 --> 02:25:59,390
from http or also give me the TV the tlc

2968
02:25:59,390 --> 02:26:01,319
extension server name what did

2969
02:26:01,319 --> 02:26:05,729
we did last year not now

2970
02:26:05,729 --> 02:26:07,830
it arrives that we have this information

2971
02:26:07,830 --> 02:26:10,200
we can delete the columns of server

2972
02:26:10,200 --> 02:26:12,479
name since this value well well I know

2973
02:26:12,479 --> 02:26:14,370
the two are already put if they realize

2974
02:26:14,370 --> 02:26:17,189
we remove from the http and we only

2975
02:26:17,189 --> 02:26:19,859
we are left with only one in this way already

2976
02:26:19,859 --> 02:26:23,640
I have my columns in this case together and

2977
02:26:23,640 --> 02:26:25,560
the one of http and the one of server name and the

2978
02:26:25,560 --> 02:26:27,420
call to be able to allow to see the

2979
02:26:27,420 --> 02:26:31,830
http and https hosts not having this

2980
02:26:31,830 --> 02:26:35,100
information we already made our sector of

2981
02:26:35,100 --> 02:26:37,859
workshop this already helps us to be able to

2982
02:26:37,859 --> 02:26:40,500
basically have a profile a little bit

2983
02:26:40,500 --> 02:26:41,359
more

2984
02:26:41,359 --> 02:26:43,620
ordered with the information that

2985
02:26:43,620 --> 02:26:45,810
we like to see as analysts and

2986
02:26:45,810 --> 02:26:47,700
many times you can also add

2987
02:26:47,700 --> 02:26:49,859
one profile or another additionally not

2988
02:26:49,859 --> 02:26:52,319
now that we are ready let's start

2989
02:26:52,319 --> 02:26:54,330
to generate our set of filters

2990
02:26:54,330 --> 02:26:56,340
favorites so you can use them with a

2991
02:26:56,340 --> 02:26:59,490
only button and also to be able to filter

2992
02:26:59,490 --> 02:27:01,350
the traffic and remove all the noise that

2993
02:27:01,350 --> 02:27:04,101
many times we are not interested

2994
02:27:04,101 --> 02:27:07,590
Let's start now if I want to see the

2995
02:27:07,590 --> 02:27:09,480
http requests and description is

2996
02:27:09,480 --> 02:27:12,210
by https with the filter that we had

2997
02:27:12,210 --> 02:27:13,920
post above basically

2998
02:27:13,920 --> 02:27:16,160
I will be able to see all this information

2999
02:27:16,160 --> 02:27:18,540
once my profile of equal to be that

3000
02:27:18,540 --> 02:27:21,601
is ready we can see that we have

3001
02:27:21,601 --> 02:27:23,340
more detailed information and here

3002
02:27:23,340 --> 02:27:25,380
where it says permanent host where it says

3003
02:27:25,380 --> 02:27:28,710
host we see http and https information

3004
02:27:28,710 --> 02:27:30,931
We already put together the columns that come from

3005
02:27:30,931 --> 02:27:33,721
not there but we are also going to see something

3006
02:27:33,721 --> 02:27:34,851
very interesting

3007
02:27:34,851 --> 02:27:38,340
here we see a line a little bit

3008
02:27:38,340 --> 02:27:41,070
bluish that is traffic from the proto

3009
02:27:41,070 --> 02:27:44,061
1900 that's something it says

3010
02:27:44,061 --> 02:27:47,610
ssp no or simple service discovery

3011
02:27:47,610 --> 02:27:50,730
protocol this usually or good is

3012
02:27:50,730 --> 02:27:53,311
generated by platforms like google

3013
02:27:53,311 --> 02:27:55,351
chrome even if you don't have it

3014
02:27:55,351 --> 02:27:58,620
running this let's say on the

3015
02:27:58,620 --> 02:28:00,150
simple fact of having it installed many

3016
02:28:00,150 --> 02:28:02,400
times it generates this traffic and this is a

3017
02:28:02,400 --> 02:28:04,710
of the reasons why of then of

3018
02:28:04,710 --> 02:28:07,050
suddenly many people do not like to have

3019
02:28:07,050 --> 02:28:09,690
installed this type of platform

3020
02:28:09,690 --> 02:28:11,641
However, well, this is not really

3021
02:28:11,641 --> 02:28:13,891
means it's something malicious but

3022
02:28:13,891 --> 02:28:16,591
we can omit the inside inside

3023
02:28:16,591 --> 02:28:20,040
our catches not then our

3024
02:28:20,040 --> 02:28:22,261
first filter what will give us what

3025
02:28:22,261 --> 02:28:24,210
it will give us information is power

3026
02:28:24,210 --> 02:28:26,940
omit this type of packets and that

3027
02:28:26,940 --> 02:28:28,500
just show me all

3028
02:28:28,500 --> 02:28:30,511
requests that go to a domain

3029
02:28:30,511 --> 02:28:35,131
http an https domain not then eye

3030
02:28:35,131 --> 02:28:37,591
I'm not saying this isn't traffic

3031
02:28:37,591 --> 02:28:39,960
malicious can also be filtered or

3032
02:28:39,960 --> 02:28:41,730
generate traffic for this type of ports

3033
02:28:41,730 --> 02:28:44,190
but for this case of these

3034
02:28:44,190 --> 02:28:46,530
laboratories, we will be able to omit it, no

3035
02:28:46,530 --> 02:28:49,580
then we are going to generate three filters

3036
02:28:49,580 --> 02:28:52,200
very common used by many

3037
02:28:52,200 --> 02:28:54,150
analysts and even in most

3038
02:28:54,150 --> 02:28:55,801
Walter's courses are generated these

3039
02:28:55,801 --> 02:28:58,440
three filters first thing first filter

3040
02:28:58,440 --> 02:29:00,480
As I had told you, it is going to

3041
02:29:00,480 --> 02:29:02,460
remove and it will show us all

3042
02:29:02,460 --> 02:29:05,160
http and https packages and the other two

3043
02:29:05,160 --> 02:29:07,440
filters I am going to explain and according to the

3044
02:29:07,440 --> 02:29:09,210
let's go generating no

3045
02:29:09,210 --> 02:29:12,240
to generate my first filter which

3046
02:29:12,240 --> 02:29:13,979
let's call basic this is a

3047
02:29:13,979 --> 02:29:15,780
label and you can put it

3048
02:29:15,780 --> 02:29:17,520
put what you want

3049
02:29:17,520 --> 02:29:19,740
The first thing is to apply the filter that

3050
02:29:19,740 --> 02:29:21,420
we want to keep what is this

3051
02:29:21,420 --> 02:29:23,520
that I put here, not this filter

3052
02:29:23,520 --> 02:29:25,650
we put in this part should appear

3053
02:29:25,650 --> 02:29:27,660
like this in green so that we can say it is

3054
02:29:27,660 --> 02:29:30,390
well and to save it we have to give it

3055
02:29:30,390 --> 02:29:32,970
click the plus button that comes let's say

3056
02:29:32,970 --> 02:29:35,310
to the other side is not a small

3057
02:29:35,310 --> 02:29:38,220
city ​​button out there we will be able

3058
02:29:38,220 --> 02:29:40,860
Let's say see the information and let's see

3059
02:29:40,860 --> 02:29:43,260
it will seem to us what the law says

3060
02:29:43,260 --> 02:29:45,120
this is where we name how

3061
02:29:45,120 --> 02:29:47,970
going to call the filter ok then here

3062
02:29:47,970 --> 02:29:49,700
you can put beige and you can put

3063
02:29:49,700 --> 02:29:53,010
dragon hard with guards blah blah blah no

3064
02:29:53,010 --> 02:29:56,440
and since we have this

3065
02:29:56,440 --> 02:29:59,381
we are going to be able to accept it we are going to

3066
02:29:59,381 --> 02:30:01,631
be able to see that a new button has been added to

3067
02:30:01,631 --> 02:30:04,150
the right with the name page and that

3068
02:30:04,150 --> 02:30:06,131
when I now click there

3069
02:30:06,131 --> 02:30:07,990
the filter will automatically be put on

3070
02:30:07,990 --> 02:30:09,971
that I have saved this is something

3071
02:30:09,971 --> 02:30:11,370
great because it saves me a lot

3072
02:30:11,370 --> 02:30:14,261
time and also, well, I can't anymore

3073
02:30:14,261 --> 02:30:16,931
even generate even signatures when I

3074
02:30:16,931 --> 02:30:19,811
I want to see I don't know malicious traffic by

3075
02:30:19,811 --> 02:30:21,370
example of an eternal the blog of a lo

3076
02:30:21,370 --> 02:30:23,740
by jay and i already know what the syntax is

3077
02:30:23,740 --> 02:30:25,271
are the expressions I need to look for

3078
02:30:25,271 --> 02:30:27,730
inside the package and I can filter from

3079
02:30:27,730 --> 02:30:29,351
the whole universe of traffic that they give me

3080
02:30:29,351 --> 02:30:31,360
Is there any kind of indication from

3081
02:30:31,360 --> 02:30:33,970
these farms do not

3082
02:30:33,970 --> 02:30:37,359
now that we have all this already

3083
02:30:37,359 --> 02:30:39,479
we have let's say the other filters

3084
02:30:39,479 --> 02:30:43,000
we have the basic basic plus basic

3085
02:30:43,000 --> 02:30:45,220
business that I will tell you about later

3086
02:30:45,220 --> 02:30:47,239
little bit of what is it

3087
02:30:47,239 --> 02:30:51,109
We are going to close the platform and here it is

3088
02:30:51,109 --> 02:30:52,339
what do we have to do once

3089
02:30:52,339 --> 02:30:54,199
we close the platform is for you to

3090
02:30:54,199 --> 02:30:56,839
save these filters and we will be able

3091
02:30:56,839 --> 02:30:59,029
Let's say generate different types of

3092
02:30:59,029 --> 02:31:01,789
profiles worth as I had commented

3093
02:31:01,789 --> 02:31:04,279
this is the one that comes by default but

3094
02:31:04,279 --> 02:31:06,379
you can save this profile with

3095
02:31:06,379 --> 02:31:08,479
the name that you like if you

3096
02:31:08,479 --> 02:31:10,520
you give the in the part that says edition and

3097
02:31:10,520 --> 02:31:13,039
configuration of profiles or in the part

3098
02:31:13,039 --> 02:31:14,899
that come to the bottom right you go

3099
02:31:14,899 --> 02:31:16,310
to be able to see what profiles you are

3100
02:31:16,310 --> 02:31:18,379
using no then lo here ya le

3101
02:31:18,379 --> 02:31:19,729
you can put the name you want

3102
02:31:19,729 --> 02:31:21,499
you can generate a new one

3103
02:31:21,499 --> 02:31:24,319
and even then you can name this

3104
02:31:24,319 --> 02:31:26,259
as I had told them to work

3105
02:31:26,259 --> 02:31:29,839
save blah blah blah no then this is it

3106
02:31:29,839 --> 02:31:31,239
a way in which you can have

3107
02:31:31,239 --> 02:31:33,829
specific profiles for analysis

3108
02:31:33,829 --> 02:31:35,720
of malicious traffic there are other profiles

3109
02:31:35,720 --> 02:31:37,640
which are for voice over ip for

3110
02:31:37,640 --> 02:31:39,289
applications will depend on what

3111
02:31:39,289 --> 02:31:41,930
you want to realize what is good

3112
02:31:41,930 --> 02:31:44,419
that the new versions of war be you

3113
02:31:44,419 --> 02:31:46,819
you can import and export profiles

3114
02:31:46,819 --> 02:31:49,339
then all this that we have just been

3115
02:31:49,339 --> 02:31:51,229
in 20 minutes basically I can

3116
02:31:51,229 --> 02:31:53,000
pass a file

3117
02:31:53,000 --> 02:31:55,760
can export or import it from

3118
02:31:55,760 --> 02:31:57,939
any way no

3119
02:31:57,939 --> 02:32:00,789
very well now we are going to regret the

3120
02:32:00,789 --> 02:32:02,649
schedule and we go half the time

3121
02:32:02,649 --> 02:32:05,920
so i think we're going we're good

3122
02:32:05,920 --> 02:32:08,649
since we have everything ready that is to say already

3123
02:32:08,649 --> 02:32:10,600
we customize guards we already generate

3124
02:32:10,600 --> 02:32:13,359
predefined filters we can perform

3125
02:32:13,359 --> 02:32:15,909
specific searches now what remains

3126
02:32:15,909 --> 02:32:18,550
is to understand since I have all this

3127
02:32:18,550 --> 02:32:20,829
information and all my tool and

3128
02:32:20,829 --> 02:32:22,840
Now yes, tread rather sharp

3129
02:32:22,840 --> 02:32:25,810
understand how I can identify users

3130
02:32:25,810 --> 02:32:28,420
and host within a traffic capture

3131
02:32:28,420 --> 02:32:30,970
and do not get me wrong internally do not misunderstand me

3132
02:32:30,970 --> 02:32:33,729
I am not referring to ips addresses I am referring to

3133
02:32:33,729 --> 02:32:35,619
to the specific user I want to know the

3134
02:32:35,619 --> 02:32:37,840
hosting I want to know what domain is

3135
02:32:37,840 --> 02:32:40,060
let's say tied up because that's the key

3136
02:32:40,060 --> 02:32:42,670
In order to identify what kind of

3137
02:32:42,670 --> 02:32:44,770
user is infected and start doing

3138
02:32:44,770 --> 02:32:47,050
A Proper Florence Boom Analysis

3139
02:32:47,050 --> 02:32:48,880
because if I only see direction and if

3140
02:32:48,880 --> 02:32:51,010
is and in most organizations

3141
02:32:51,010 --> 02:32:53,770
use of hcp is surely this and you

3142
02:32:53,770 --> 02:32:56,109
it will change, it does not exist, it is a

3143
02:32:56,109 --> 02:32:57,999
way to get in a little more

3144
02:32:57,999 --> 02:33:01,380
what i'm trying to investigate

3145
02:33:01,380 --> 02:33:05,370
and now this as the core point of the

3146
02:33:05,370 --> 02:33:07,500
investigation we are going to use two

3147
02:33:07,500 --> 02:33:09,540
filters there are many more

3148
02:33:09,540 --> 02:33:12,630
obviously for time we are going to use

3149
02:33:12,630 --> 02:33:14,430
these two filters to identify the

3150
02:33:14,430 --> 02:33:17,280
users and I'm still in the first capture

3151
02:33:17,280 --> 02:33:20,010
since then what is how they had

3152
02:33:20,010 --> 02:33:21,750
commented send a message and I will

3153
02:33:21,750 --> 02:33:23,310
I send the captures so they can do

3154
02:33:23,310 --> 02:33:26,040
do these exercises when I want

3155
02:33:26,040 --> 02:33:28,830
see the hosts inside let's say inside

3156
02:33:28,830 --> 02:33:30,810
from some network capture we can

3157
02:33:30,810 --> 02:33:32,670
use the first filter to see

3158
02:33:32,670 --> 02:33:35,160
let's say hcp requests not what

3159
02:33:35,160 --> 02:33:36,620
it comes that way

3160
02:33:36,620 --> 02:33:39,300
it depends on the version of guardian if you

3161
02:33:39,300 --> 02:33:41,040
you have an old pressure use the

3162
02:33:41,040 --> 02:33:43,350
what does wood or bulldog trap say if you have

3163
02:33:43,350 --> 02:33:45,660
a new version uses the filter

3164
02:33:45,660 --> 02:33:47,010
hcp

3165
02:33:47,010 --> 02:33:49,320
host configuration protector this works for me

3166
02:33:49,320 --> 02:33:50,580
to allow to see all the

3167
02:33:50,580 --> 02:33:53,189
hcp negotiations both in layer 2

3168
02:33:53,189 --> 02:33:55,560
until fill let's say the allocation of

3169
02:33:55,560 --> 02:33:58,971
ips ms blah blah blah

3170
02:33:58,971 --> 02:34:01,700
and so

3171
02:34:01,700 --> 02:34:03,681
for what kind of information will we use

3172
02:34:03,681 --> 02:34:07,790
give the logic of hcp not when each

3173
02:34:07,790 --> 02:34:10,550
let's say device connects to some

3174
02:34:10,550 --> 02:34:12,170
network every time you connect to your network

3175
02:34:12,170 --> 02:34:14,181
wifi is done in this kind of

3176
02:34:14,181 --> 02:34:17,420
requests from time to time ok many

3177
02:34:17,420 --> 02:34:19,250
sometimes it's a matter of minutes it's a matter

3178
02:34:19,250 --> 02:34:22,280
of hours depends on how it is configured

3179
02:34:22,280 --> 02:34:24,590
if we capture or have inside

3180
02:34:24,590 --> 02:34:27,530
of our traffic sample some kind

3181
02:34:27,530 --> 02:34:29,570
of this request we will be able to find

3182
02:34:29,570 --> 02:34:31,851
the information needed to profile

3183
02:34:31,851 --> 02:34:34,851
the host we are following does not like

3184
02:34:34,851 --> 02:34:36,410
a mac address as a hot line

3185
02:34:36,410 --> 02:34:39,561
etcetera etcetera then within the

3186
02:34:39,561 --> 02:34:41,271
first capture we are going to add the

3187
02:34:41,271 --> 02:34:44,811
hcp or boot filter being your version and

3188
02:34:44,811 --> 02:34:47,840
the second one that comes around is n b ms

3189
02:34:47,840 --> 02:34:49,220
This is to be able to identify the

3190
02:34:49,220 --> 02:34:52,010
netbook traffic and this helps us to

3191
02:34:52,010 --> 02:34:53,900
identify the 'holding' of the device

3192
02:34:53,900 --> 02:34:55,641
that these are packages that are also

3193
02:34:55,641 --> 02:34:57,440
sent periodically within the

3194
02:34:57,440 --> 02:34:59,690
network not for a directory environment

3195
02:34:59,690 --> 02:35:02,630
active or with domain controller as well

3196
02:35:02,630 --> 02:35:04,340
can be used to take no

3197
02:35:04,340 --> 02:35:06,800
only the hosting but also the

3198
02:35:06,800 --> 02:35:08,960
win account name not by

3199
02:35:08,960 --> 02:35:11,870
example I don't know any point towers there is no

3200
02:35:11,870 --> 02:35:14,270
towers then this also helps us to

3201
02:35:14,270 --> 02:35:18,979
be able to see profile that device

3202
02:35:18,979 --> 02:35:20,390
very good

3203
02:35:20,390 --> 02:35:22,880
Now we are going to add the filter that says

3204
02:35:22,880 --> 02:35:25,460
of hcp in this capture and we are going to see the

3205
02:35:25,460 --> 02:35:27,800
first package let's see the result

3206
02:35:27,800 --> 02:35:29,720
not the first package that comes here

3207
02:35:29,720 --> 02:35:32,510
how do you realize I'm leaving the cape

3208
02:35:32,510 --> 02:35:35,630
1 then layer 2 layer 3 prince and so we

3209
02:35:35,630 --> 02:35:39,069
let's go until we get to the hcp part

3210
02:35:39,069 --> 02:35:43,159
something that we are going to see very interesting is

3211
02:35:43,159 --> 02:35:45,050
than in the hcp package listing

3212
02:35:45,050 --> 02:35:47,539
we are going to expand until we reach the part

3213
02:35:47,539 --> 02:35:50,689
What does hosting say? Okay, here I am going to see.

3214
02:35:50,689 --> 02:35:53,359
a lot of information and it is important

3215
02:35:53,359 --> 02:35:55,609
understand that this or the first

3216
02:35:55,609 --> 02:35:56,899
speciation milk requests

3217
02:35:56,899 --> 02:35:58,609
broadcast

3218
02:35:58,609 --> 02:36:01,039
and then any type of device for

3219
02:36:01,039 --> 02:36:02,510
example a fake hcp could

3220
02:36:02,510 --> 02:36:05,630
answer no in this case we will be able

3221
02:36:05,630 --> 02:36:07,960
see that the hosting of this device

3222
02:36:07,960 --> 02:36:13,729
says finance 8 efe 25 pc no now it is

3223
02:36:13,729 --> 02:36:15,979
necessary to know that many times I don't know

3224
02:36:15,979 --> 02:36:19,189
can capture hcp traffic for that

3225
02:36:19,189 --> 02:36:21,499
I just mentioned the other filter

3226
02:36:21,499 --> 02:36:24,030
what will be the shipping

3227
02:36:24,030 --> 02:36:27,570
this can be used say when

3228
02:36:27,570 --> 02:36:29,820
this is a device that is a

3229
02:36:29,820 --> 02:36:32,090
windows a windows machine not

3230
02:36:32,090 --> 02:36:35,490
It pretty much looks something like this if I

3231
02:36:35,490 --> 02:36:37,710
in this same capture I want I want

3232
02:36:37,710 --> 02:36:39,540
review I want to capture this type of

3233
02:36:39,540 --> 02:36:41,851
traffic I'm going to put only this one on

3234
02:36:41,851 --> 02:36:45,960
eve more and we will see the service we will

3235
02:36:45,960 --> 02:36:48,210
see what the hosting goes directly

3236
02:36:48,210 --> 02:36:50,490
inside the packages not me included

3237
02:36:50,490 --> 02:36:52,860
could you add this as a column if

3238
02:36:52,860 --> 02:36:55,351
were necessary basically I have to

3239
02:36:55,351 --> 02:36:59,040
go to the packages panel and then

3240
02:36:59,040 --> 02:37:00,960
basically I'm going to the part of nerves

3241
02:37:00,960 --> 02:37:03,511
I see the quadris and here I can go to

3242
02:37:03,511 --> 02:37:06,090
be able to see the information not and including

3243
02:37:06,090 --> 02:37:07,230
I could see a little more

3244
02:37:07,230 --> 02:37:08,971
information if necessary for me

3245
02:37:08,971 --> 02:37:11,460
have it around then this is something

3246
02:37:11,460 --> 02:37:13,740
which also helps us to profile in

3247
02:37:13,740 --> 02:37:15,570
different let's say different ways of

3248
02:37:15,570 --> 02:37:18,120
do this profiling no and now

3249
02:37:18,120 --> 02:37:20,221
we can see that it gives us very

3250
02:37:20,221 --> 02:37:23,851
specific is very let's say difficult to be able

3251
02:37:23,851 --> 02:37:26,070
know or generate these filters so

3252
02:37:26,070 --> 02:37:27,511
I could also even

3253
02:37:27,511 --> 02:37:28,560
save

3254
02:37:28,560 --> 02:37:30,569
It depends if it was for me let's say

3255
02:37:30,569 --> 02:37:33,149
need to have this or not then this

3256
02:37:33,149 --> 02:37:34,590
it is another way that also you

3257
02:37:34,590 --> 02:37:36,540
can generate an additional filter for

3258
02:37:36,540 --> 02:37:38,579
to be able to see the hot names or let's say the

3259
02:37:38,579 --> 02:37:43,159
packages specific to this point is worth

3260
02:37:43,220 --> 02:37:46,489
now what next since we have this

3261
02:37:46,489 --> 02:37:47,859
information

3262
02:37:47,859 --> 02:37:51,649
What now remains to be said at last is

3263
02:37:51,649 --> 02:37:53,330
start to see a couple of exercises

3264
02:37:53,330 --> 02:37:54,920
malicious traffic in very

3265
02:37:54,920 --> 02:37:58,160
cute we usually do all this

3266
02:37:58,160 --> 02:37:59,750
tool path through

3267
02:37:59,750 --> 02:38:02,390
different questions the first for

3268
02:38:02,390 --> 02:38:04,670
Let's say homologate the profile in which

3269
02:38:04,670 --> 02:38:06,020
we want to be working

3270
02:38:06,020 --> 02:38:09,260
also to be able to show the capacity

3271
02:38:09,260 --> 02:38:11,420
of customization that has a

3272
02:38:11,420 --> 02:38:13,550
tool as guard and the other point

3273
02:38:13,550 --> 02:38:15,590
also to give a bit of context

3274
02:38:15,590 --> 02:38:17,470
how packages work inside

3275
02:38:17,470 --> 02:38:19,700
within a capture or even within

3276
02:38:19,700 --> 02:38:21,979
of the network not within the classes that

3277
02:38:21,979 --> 02:38:24,380
we do we see art hcp requests

3278
02:38:24,380 --> 02:38:27,710
broadcast storm spoofing

3279
02:38:27,710 --> 02:38:29,689
flooding an ep we all do it in

3280
02:38:29,689 --> 02:38:32,260
whatsapp or even when they are done

3281
02:38:32,260 --> 02:38:35,330
scans with emma is also done o

3282
02:38:35,330 --> 02:38:37,279
is reviewed let's say how these look

3283
02:38:37,279 --> 02:38:39,200
network level scans not once

3284
02:38:39,200 --> 02:38:40,970
run the tool and it intercepts is

3285
02:38:40,970 --> 02:38:42,470
the traffic

3286
02:38:42,470 --> 02:38:44,710
to talk a little bit about these

3287
02:38:44,710 --> 02:38:47,989
let's say devices or this had this

3288
02:38:47,989 --> 02:38:49,670
malware as such I would like to talk to you

3289
02:38:49,670 --> 02:38:51,170
a bit about the evolution of

3290
02:38:51,170 --> 02:38:53,359
malware and this is to give some

3291
02:38:53,359 --> 02:38:55,489
context that previously

3292
02:38:55,489 --> 02:38:58,279
really the malware issues were not

3293
02:38:58,279 --> 02:38:59,960
as advanced as we see them to date

3294
02:38:59,960 --> 02:39:01,850
today there were no action mechanisms of

3295
02:39:01,850 --> 02:39:04,850
defense did not excite information by

3296
02:39:04,850 --> 02:39:08,060
protocols are not encrypted

3297
02:39:08,060 --> 02:39:10,489
they made, let's say, encryptions of information

3298
02:39:10,489 --> 02:39:12,350
massive through vulnerabilities or

3299
02:39:12,350 --> 02:39:14,350
lateral movements etc. etc.

3300
02:39:14,350 --> 02:39:17,210
but rather before the

3301
02:39:17,210 --> 02:39:20,000
malware was distributed by things like

3302
02:39:20,000 --> 02:39:22,399
these not some kind of left in

3303
02:39:22,399 --> 02:39:25,160
some a subscription some magazine or

3304
02:39:25,160 --> 02:39:27,859
others do not and we find threats

3305
02:39:27,859 --> 02:39:31,149
and a little basic that basically

3306
02:39:31,149 --> 02:39:34,220
they modified your system things appeared

3307
02:39:34,220 --> 02:39:36,080
annoying animations like this that you see

3308
02:39:36,080 --> 02:39:38,149
around here they changed the content and

3309
02:39:38,149 --> 02:39:39,830
display color characters

3310
02:39:39,830 --> 02:39:40,939
the same

3311
02:39:40,939 --> 02:39:43,520
or even there was another

3312
02:39:43,520 --> 02:39:45,710
type of threats and a little or

3313
02:39:45,710 --> 02:39:48,289
variants let's say a little more

3314
02:39:48,289 --> 02:39:50,809
and takers like this one called de

3315
02:39:50,809 --> 02:39:52,789
walker that as his name says

3316
02:39:52,789 --> 02:39:55,279
time it is executed it appears to us is a

3317
02:39:55,279 --> 02:39:56,689
person walking through the

3318
02:39:56,689 --> 02:40:00,079
screen and you will see before it was very sensitive

3319
02:40:00,079 --> 02:40:02,839
realize that our computer

3320
02:40:02,839 --> 02:40:04,579
had been infected because the same

3321
02:40:04,579 --> 02:40:07,189
threat told you with a message with

3322
02:40:07,189 --> 02:40:09,439
an animation or something like that

3323
02:40:09,439 --> 02:40:12,319
however as of today one of the

3324
02:40:12,319 --> 02:40:13,999
main targets of a threat

3325
02:40:13,999 --> 02:40:16,489
computing is to go unnoticed with

3326
02:40:16,489 --> 02:40:19,159
all the techniques that we already know and

3327
02:40:19,159 --> 02:40:22,309
more curious is that even europol

3328
02:40:22,309 --> 02:40:26,389
at the beginning of last year he spoke that

3329
02:40:26,389 --> 02:40:28,849
the whole issue of the pandemic made

3330
02:40:28,849 --> 02:40:30,859
there would be a very large increase in

3331
02:40:30,859 --> 02:40:32,959
phishing campaigns rawson themes

3332
02:40:32,959 --> 02:40:34,369
good even that in Latin America not

3333
02:40:34,369 --> 02:40:36,549
there have been many countries in Latin America

3334
02:40:36,549 --> 02:40:39,559
colombia argentina costa rica don't say

3335
02:40:39,559 --> 02:40:42,079
that have had great impacts

3336
02:40:42,079 --> 02:40:44,329
only at the infrastructure level but

3337
02:40:44,329 --> 02:40:45,379
also critical infrastructure

3338
02:40:45,379 --> 02:40:48,319
thus affecting issues such as import and

3339
02:40:48,319 --> 02:40:50,089
export of food medicines

3340
02:40:50,089 --> 02:40:52,429
including as an employee the economy of

3341
02:40:52,429 --> 02:40:54,801
including the country and this has a lot

3342
02:40:54,801 --> 02:40:56,801
what to give for remote jobs

3343
02:40:56,801 --> 02:40:58,370
devices the great rise

3344
02:40:58,370 --> 02:41:00,681
yuty devices and other things

3345
02:41:00,681 --> 02:41:02,590
additional way

3346
02:41:02,590 --> 02:41:06,040
and precisely for this is that I am going to

3347
02:41:06,040 --> 02:41:08,710
talk a bit about what they are

3348
02:41:08,710 --> 02:41:10,750
some threats that have out there

3349
02:41:10,750 --> 02:41:12,570
Touched to be analyzing these are

3350
02:41:12,570 --> 02:41:16,450
threats totally from 2021 that are

3351
02:41:16,450 --> 02:41:18,399
talk about how many attacks there have been in

3352
02:41:18,399 --> 02:41:20,530
Latin America and how many shall we say

3353
02:41:20,530 --> 02:41:23,830
represent in the top 3 threats that

3354
02:41:23,830 --> 02:41:28,620
it won't let us and you had any questions

3355
02:41:30,780 --> 02:41:35,080
perfect now what am I going to

3356
02:41:35,080 --> 02:41:37,390
show within these threats these

3357
02:41:37,390 --> 02:41:40,270
threats are some of the areas that

3358
02:41:40,270 --> 02:41:42,399
I'm going to show you they represent part of

3359
02:41:42,399 --> 02:41:44,320
these large numbers that we see in

3360
02:41:44,320 --> 02:41:46,960
Latin America one of them is what and

3361
02:41:46,960 --> 02:41:49,390
another one is called iso root which basically

3362
02:41:49,390 --> 02:41:51,820
is a malware that gets installed inside

3363
02:41:51,820 --> 02:41:54,220
the devices can be in this case

3364
02:41:54,220 --> 02:41:56,350
distribute through campaigns like

3365
02:41:56,350 --> 02:41:59,649
phishing as fraudulent web pages

3366
02:41:59,649 --> 02:42:01,359
well, they can disable you

3367
02:42:01,359 --> 02:42:03,700
computer can steal a lot

3368
02:42:03,700 --> 02:42:05,979
information that can change records

3369
02:42:05,979 --> 02:42:08,610
or generate traffic that many times is not

3370
02:42:08,610 --> 02:42:12,391
wishing within the network not for this and

3371
02:42:12,391 --> 02:42:14,490
now yes since we are going to talk a

3372
02:42:14,490 --> 02:42:16,740
little bit about this point we are going to

3373
02:42:16,740 --> 02:42:18,511
have a set of characteristics

3374
02:42:18,511 --> 02:42:20,521
network we are going to analyze this campaign that

3375
02:42:20,521 --> 02:42:23,460
called the anti-vote and that he was not going to be able

3376
02:42:23,460 --> 02:42:25,920
open to be able to give information about

3377
02:42:25,920 --> 02:42:27,780
what are the command servers and

3378
02:42:27,780 --> 02:42:30,900
control how the infection was carried out and

3379
02:42:30,900 --> 02:42:33,420
including certain indicators that

3380
02:42:33,420 --> 02:42:36,271
they will be able to help validate what kind of

3381
02:42:36,271 --> 02:42:38,700
information I'm looking for who it is

3382
02:42:38,700 --> 02:42:40,980
say we have traffic from a computer

3383
02:42:40,980 --> 02:42:43,261
previously infected by this campaign

3384
02:42:43,261 --> 02:42:45,990
what is called lock and vote and well

3385
02:42:45,990 --> 02:42:47,670
some alerts that I am going to show you

3386
02:42:47,670 --> 02:42:51,450
are detected for example by and from

3387
02:42:51,450 --> 02:42:54,271
feces as it is security government that

3388
02:42:54,271 --> 02:42:56,190
use for example meerkat to be able to

3389
02:42:56,190 --> 02:42:58,471
detect traffic patterns

3390
02:42:58,471 --> 02:43:00,540
if we want to know for example

3391
02:43:00,540 --> 02:43:03,061
a very very common indicator of what is

3392
02:43:03,061 --> 02:43:06,150
what he voted we can see even if

3393
02:43:06,150 --> 02:43:08,370
we play any

3394
02:43:08,370 --> 02:43:11,790
let's say we put the 3 intelligence or

3395
02:43:11,790 --> 02:43:14,220
indicators of commitment something I will

3396
02:43:14,220 --> 02:43:16,561
see and this is something I like to show

3397
02:43:16,561 --> 02:43:18,240
much this is a report in info blogs

3398
02:43:18,240 --> 02:43:20,220
that it is very very good that he spoke a

3399
02:43:20,220 --> 02:43:22,351
little bit about what this threat is

3400
02:43:22,351 --> 02:43:24,720
what is this part of root access and what

3401
02:43:24,720 --> 02:43:28,380
classify this as an impostor

3402
02:43:28,380 --> 02:43:30,420
let's say the report has a lot

3403
02:43:30,420 --> 02:43:32,460
information but what I want

3404
02:43:32,460 --> 02:43:33,811
to focus a little is to start the

3405
02:43:33,811 --> 02:43:35,851
characteristics here we will see

3406
02:43:35,851 --> 02:43:38,460
very interesting features and

3407
02:43:38,460 --> 02:43:40,140
something very good here are features

3408
02:43:40,140 --> 02:43:43,110
keys that, for example, one says that

3409
02:43:43,110 --> 02:43:45,351
one of its characteristics is threatened

3410
02:43:45,351 --> 02:43:48,680
is that the user agent many times

3411
02:43:48,680 --> 02:43:52,380
appears as they cast hell and then

3412
02:43:52,380 --> 02:43:54,360
this is something that we can

3413
02:43:54,360 --> 02:43:57,090
give a lot a lot a lot of information when

3414
02:43:57,090 --> 02:44:00,450
we want to understand or analyze

3415
02:44:00,450 --> 02:44:02,820
this type of traffic captures and this

3416
02:44:02,820 --> 02:44:04,021
is the capture with which we are going to

3417
02:44:04,021 --> 02:44:06,180
work we are going to use the filter that

3418
02:44:06,180 --> 02:44:09,480
It's called basic and we're going to see a little

3419
02:44:09,480 --> 02:44:10,920
what does this show us

3420
02:44:10,920 --> 02:44:13,351
second pickup and remember that when

3421
02:44:13,351 --> 02:44:15,850
we hit the filter that says

3422
02:44:15,850 --> 02:44:18,279
lazy well it will seem to us let's say this

3423
02:44:18,279 --> 02:44:19,870
filter we have here too all

3424
02:44:19,870 --> 02:44:23,979
http and https requests and here it is

3425
02:44:23,979 --> 02:44:25,210
that we are going to see very

3426
02:44:25,210 --> 02:44:27,520
interesting is that these requests go

3427
02:44:27,520 --> 02:44:30,640
towards this domain that, well, not really

3428
02:44:30,640 --> 02:44:32,739
looks like a legitimate domain no

3429
02:44:32,739 --> 02:44:34,930
then what follows is to take one of

3430
02:44:34,930 --> 02:44:37,290
these packages and continue the conversation

3431
02:44:37,290 --> 02:44:40,449
Well, in this case in tcp it will not work for me

3432
02:44:40,449 --> 02:44:42,580
appear a screen like this and here

3433
02:44:42,580 --> 02:44:45,100
I'm going to see basically the first

3434
02:44:45,100 --> 02:44:47,739
indicator not whenever I see this and

3435
02:44:47,739 --> 02:44:49,830
use it within a communication

3436
02:44:49,830 --> 02:44:54,189
it means that it is an indicator

3437
02:44:54,189 --> 02:44:56,830
of infection about this campaign not that

3438
02:44:56,830 --> 02:45:01,600
is what you voted for and now that we have

3439
02:45:01,600 --> 02:45:04,180
this information that is posted by

3440
02:45:04,180 --> 02:45:06,630
example out there in red

3441
02:45:06,630 --> 02:45:10,239
let's see something very interesting let's go

3442
02:45:10,239 --> 02:45:12,310
to see a user named alice or

3443
02:45:12,310 --> 02:45:14,080
brien

3444
02:45:14,080 --> 02:45:17,729
and that's where it comes too

3445
02:45:17,990 --> 02:45:20,940
sorry the domain that says pizza jukebox

3446
02:45:20,940 --> 02:45:23,280
no we are also going to see something that says

3447
02:45:23,280 --> 02:45:26,070
http sorry let's see something that says

3448
02:45:26,070 --> 02:45:30,271
http 404 not found however this is

3449
02:45:30,271 --> 02:45:31,970
a feature of this threat

3450
02:45:31,970 --> 02:45:34,530
always shows that red the most

3451
02:45:34,530 --> 02:45:36,150
the times that we have had to analyze it

3452
02:45:36,150 --> 02:45:38,040
shown to be broken as to show

3453
02:45:38,040 --> 02:45:39,990
some kind of residue makes some kind of

3454
02:45:39,990 --> 02:45:42,480
very simple evasion that we say that

3455
02:45:42,480 --> 02:45:44,280
long to find information but

3456
02:45:44,280 --> 02:45:45,660
it really is a very very callback

3457
02:45:45,660 --> 02:45:47,700
simple

3458
02:45:47,700 --> 02:45:50,700
now this is the easiest way to

3459
02:45:50,700 --> 02:45:52,101
be able to understand

3460
02:45:52,101 --> 02:45:54,720
then let's say when there is some kind

3461
02:45:54,720 --> 02:45:57,601
of infection looking for clear indicators

3462
02:45:57,601 --> 02:45:59,940
they can be hashish they can be domains or

3463
02:45:59,940 --> 02:46:01,620
they can be in this case i will be jens

3464
02:46:01,620 --> 02:46:04,290
like the one we just saw not now

3465
02:46:04,290 --> 02:46:06,720
inside this capture we are going to use

3466
02:46:06,720 --> 02:46:07,980
the knowledge we acquired

3467
02:46:07,980 --> 02:46:10,561
previously and we are going to analyze host and

3468
02:46:10,561 --> 02:46:13,080
users as we well know there is a

3469
02:46:13,080 --> 02:46:14,521
domain controller environment

3470
02:46:14,521 --> 02:46:17,220
called pizza jukebox and in this capture

3471
02:46:17,220 --> 02:46:18,960
well let's say the infection is very cute

3472
02:46:18,960 --> 02:46:20,940
there are really only a couple of users

3473
02:46:20,940 --> 02:46:23,311
we will be able to analyze them and enter

3474
02:46:23,311 --> 02:46:26,460
meta more detail the idea is to use

3475
02:46:26,460 --> 02:46:29,070
a filter called that riveros this

3476
02:46:29,070 --> 02:46:31,141
It is case sensitive, that is, the first must

3477
02:46:31,141 --> 02:46:33,450
to be lowercase and we are going to put

3478
02:46:33,450 --> 02:46:36,271
kerberos without name string this will work for me

3479
02:46:36,271 --> 02:46:37,940
give the necessary information

3480
02:46:37,940 --> 02:46:40,830
Well, in order to understand what the

3481
02:46:40,830 --> 02:46:43,681
hosting inside let's say the device

3482
02:46:43,681 --> 02:46:45,900
infected not then I can already see the

3483
02:46:45,900 --> 02:46:48,150
username I can also see the

3484
02:46:48,150 --> 02:46:51,120
domain the one that is and this is precisely

3485
02:46:51,120 --> 02:46:52,710
what I am interested in putting as

3486
02:46:52,710 --> 02:46:53,850
column

3487
02:46:53,850 --> 02:46:56,550
I start to be a little more then

3488
02:46:56,550 --> 02:46:59,420
Let's say but I can be a little more

3489
02:46:59,420 --> 02:47:02,100
specific to be able to understand which

3490
02:47:02,100 --> 02:47:03,989
are the usernames that are

3491
02:47:03,989 --> 02:47:06,239
accessing malicious domains and so on

3492
02:47:06,239 --> 02:47:08,279
I can now do this correlation no longer

3493
02:47:08,279 --> 02:47:10,649
I have my column that shows the hosting

3494
02:47:10,649 --> 02:47:12,779
of windows or kerberos and well

3495
02:47:12,779 --> 02:47:14,970
we can see that you have a domain since

3496
02:47:14,970 --> 02:47:18,779
So it has the dollar symbol at the end.

3497
02:47:18,779 --> 02:47:19,770
and why is the name of the

3498
02:47:19,770 --> 02:47:22,529
windows users no and now we can

3499
02:47:22,529 --> 02:47:24,989
confirm that aliso bryant is a user

3500
02:47:24,989 --> 02:47:27,510
of windows and that since you can also

3501
02:47:27,510 --> 02:47:28,979
be infected with this type of

3502
02:47:28,979 --> 02:47:30,779
threats

3503
02:47:30,779 --> 02:47:32,670
many companies are used and this is

3504
02:47:32,670 --> 02:47:34,109
a great advantage many companies

3505
02:47:34,109 --> 02:47:34,850
use

3506
02:47:34,850 --> 02:47:37,890
this nomenclature in your domain and this

3507
02:47:37,890 --> 02:47:39,689
allows us to contact this user

3508
02:47:39,689 --> 02:47:42,689
to be able to profile it directly and

3509
02:47:42,689 --> 02:47:44,609
tell him that his device is

3510
02:47:44,609 --> 02:47:45,989
infected is not making requests

3511
02:47:45,989 --> 02:47:47,430
anomalous

3512
02:47:47,430 --> 02:47:49,260
by a threat called the computer

3513
02:47:49,260 --> 02:47:50,939
for example is generating traffic

3514
02:47:50,939 --> 02:47:53,310
malicious we need to disinfect the y

3515
02:47:53,310 --> 02:47:56,391
we start our whole process as such

3516
02:47:56,391 --> 02:48:00,470
Now let's see a second example

3517
02:48:00,470 --> 02:48:03,750
this is an exercise by eiso ruth and here

3518
02:48:03,750 --> 02:48:06,570
We are going to see another segment but it does not have

3519
02:48:06,570 --> 02:48:09,360
domain controller this machine

3520
02:48:09,360 --> 02:48:11,580
was also infected by sting was

3521
02:48:11,580 --> 02:48:14,910
stiller and well, it comes to the way

3522
02:48:14,910 --> 02:48:16,830
in which it is generally distributed is

3523
02:48:16,830 --> 02:48:19,290
by email cannot be

3524
02:48:19,290 --> 02:48:22,141
a touch me that can take you towards

3525
02:48:22,141 --> 02:48:24,480
some kind of malicious web page that

3526
02:48:24,480 --> 02:48:26,490
some vulnerability can be exploited

3527
02:48:26,490 --> 02:48:28,530
in your browser and collect information

3528
02:48:28,530 --> 02:48:31,110
of your games password of anger leaks

3529
02:48:31,110 --> 02:48:33,180
via http not after it is deleted from

3530
02:48:33,180 --> 02:48:35,280
automatic way then here too

3531
02:48:35,280 --> 02:48:37,561
we can see information about these

3532
02:48:37,561 --> 02:48:40,650
threats is a very good way to

3533
02:48:40,650 --> 02:48:42,960
to be able to understand what I should

3534
02:48:42,960 --> 02:48:44,370
search and as we mentioned the

3535
02:48:44,370 --> 02:48:47,700
principle is to seek or understand a

3536
02:48:47,700 --> 02:48:50,220
problem that I, well, let's say I already know which one

3537
02:48:50,220 --> 02:48:52,080
It is not arrived I already understand I want

3538
02:48:52,080 --> 02:48:54,840
see the root cause then for this I

3539
02:48:54,840 --> 02:48:57,000
I can see in this case if I want to search

3540
02:48:57,000 --> 02:48:59,820
and did root I can go to what is

3541
02:48:59,820 --> 02:49:02,130
miter attack and here he is going to give us a very

3542
02:49:02,130 --> 02:49:03,090
good definition

3543
02:49:03,090 --> 02:49:05,850
and working for those who do not know is

3544
02:49:05,850 --> 02:49:08,010
a data source of information

3545
02:49:08,010 --> 02:49:10,130
threats malicious groups

3546
02:49:10,130 --> 02:49:13,590
Well, let's say that he can give you all the

3547
02:49:13,590 --> 02:49:15,720
information on technical tactics and

3548
02:49:15,720 --> 02:49:18,030
procedures how they operate what kind of

3549
02:49:18,030 --> 02:49:19,740
software uses and even gives you

3550
02:49:19,740 --> 02:49:20,670
recommendations

3551
02:49:20,670 --> 02:49:22,590
this is a non-profit organization

3552
02:49:22,590 --> 02:49:24,750
profit and well here it gives us very

3553
02:49:24,750 --> 02:49:26,580
interesting does not tell us that this is a

3554
02:49:26,580 --> 02:49:28,590
commercial Trojan that is used to

3555
02:49:28,590 --> 02:49:32,070
steal information since 2018

3556
02:49:32,070 --> 02:49:34,109
who has been very very active in america

3557
02:49:34,109 --> 02:49:36,000
from the north now we are already seeing it in

3558
02:49:36,000 --> 02:49:38,640
Latin America and has even been seen

3559
02:49:38,640 --> 02:49:39,990
has used for crypto theft

3560
02:49:39,990 --> 02:49:43,290
coins no and in this exercise this is

3561
02:49:43,290 --> 02:49:45,180
an infection from an email that had a

3562
02:49:45,180 --> 02:49:47,220
malicious link and a tapped

3563
02:49:47,220 --> 02:49:49,080
vulnerability since a couple of years ago

3564
02:49:49,080 --> 02:49:51,870
years through a word with macros and

3565
02:49:51,870 --> 02:49:54,480
else then

3566
02:49:54,480 --> 02:49:56,790
if someone was monitoring the network

3567
02:49:56,790 --> 02:49:58,711
surely there will be something like this

3568
02:49:58,711 --> 02:50:01,561
which is here I can use one of

3569
02:50:01,561 --> 02:50:03,900
the filters that I created and I'm going to see something

3570
02:50:03,900 --> 02:50:07,950
like this vitali or web bit.ly no

3571
02:50:07,950 --> 02:50:10,940
so this many times

3572
02:50:10,940 --> 02:50:14,131
for this type of requests we would have

3573
02:50:14,131 --> 02:50:15,480
to be careful because we need

3574
02:50:15,480 --> 02:50:16,830
know where it is in our league

3575
02:50:16,830 --> 02:50:19,230
cropped not the second post out there

3576
02:50:19,230 --> 02:50:22,320
What I have is a get to say that I know

3577
02:50:22,320 --> 02:50:24,721
you want to make a request

3578
02:50:24,721 --> 02:50:27,601
data download not when i follow the

3579
02:50:27,601 --> 02:50:29,641
conversation I begin to see what is happening

3580
02:50:29,641 --> 02:50:31,110
wanting access to some kind of

3581
02:50:31,110 --> 02:50:33,330
domain that many times could be

3582
02:50:33,330 --> 02:50:35,851
the best malicious or not then what

3583
02:50:35,851 --> 02:50:38,671
interesting here is to take this package and

3584
02:50:38,671 --> 02:50:41,700
follow the tcp conversation and here i go

3585
02:50:41,700 --> 02:50:44,070
to be able to see very very good information

3586
02:50:44,070 --> 02:50:46,080
first is that when I see this that

3587
02:50:46,080 --> 02:50:48,301
this program is here because it cannot

3588
02:50:48,301 --> 02:50:50,820
be run on win32 and see your three

3589
02:50:50,820 --> 02:50:52,320
characters

3590
02:50:52,320 --> 02:50:56,461
m zp basically tells me that this is a

3591
02:50:56,461 --> 02:50:58,830
file that can be executed

3592
02:50:58,830 --> 02:51:02,130
and what we can do with this is power

3593
02:51:02,130 --> 02:51:04,500
reassemble this file and be able to

3594
02:51:04,500 --> 02:51:07,311
check if this file is malicious ok

3595
02:51:07,311 --> 02:51:09,870
to do this, let's say, is very very

3596
02:51:09,870 --> 02:51:12,210
simple I can go to the part that

3597
02:51:12,210 --> 02:51:16,260
says files export objects by http

3598
02:51:16,260 --> 02:51:17,910
and well here I will be able to see

3599
02:51:17,910 --> 02:51:20,160
what are the hot names and what are the

3600
02:51:20,160 --> 02:51:21,300
files that interest me

3601
02:51:21,300 --> 02:51:23,730
download it I download this with this

3602
02:51:23,730 --> 02:51:25,380
same extension if you are

3603
02:51:25,380 --> 02:51:26,960
doing this in a

3604
02:51:26,960 --> 02:51:29,700
let's say on a windows machine

3605
02:51:29,700 --> 02:51:32,400
I recommend that they put another extension

3606
02:51:32,400 --> 02:51:34,771
that they do not execute it or preferably that

3607
02:51:34,771 --> 02:51:36,570
do it in a virtual machine in a

3608
02:51:36,570 --> 02:51:38,850
mac machine or on a linux machine

3609
02:51:38,850 --> 02:51:41,910
for example they can't take this file

3610
02:51:41,910 --> 02:51:44,070
and once it is reassembled let's say with

3611
02:51:44,070 --> 02:51:45,960
all the packages I can't go to the

3612
02:51:45,960 --> 02:51:48,180
platform like total virus and i can

3613
02:51:48,180 --> 02:51:50,390
upload the hadj can i upload the file no

3614
02:51:50,390 --> 02:51:53,010
the hash basically I'm going to say that

3615
02:51:53,010 --> 02:51:55,980
this is or that this is detected by

3616
02:51:55,980 --> 02:51:58,561
more than 61 antivirus engines and it's going to

3617
02:51:58,561 --> 02:52:01,380
give enough information and even the

3618
02:52:01,380 --> 02:52:03,090
relationship that this artifact has

3619
02:52:03,090 --> 02:52:06,329
with different combats towards domains

3620
02:52:06,329 --> 02:52:08,249
that out there I can be seeing no

3621
02:52:08,249 --> 02:52:10,379
these indicators of commitment

3622
02:52:10,379 --> 02:52:12,089
I can take I can add others

3623
02:52:12,089 --> 02:52:14,640
platforms that will be able to help

3624
02:52:14,640 --> 02:52:16,229
to monitor the service robot

3625
02:52:16,229 --> 02:52:18,810
infrastructure there are no others

3626
02:52:18,810 --> 02:52:21,270
tools like the soul tracker

3627
02:52:21,270 --> 02:52:22,770
It is a tool that out there

3628
02:52:22,770 --> 02:52:24,930
I found that they can give you domains that

3629
02:52:24,930 --> 02:52:27,479
are linked to, well, let's say the use

3630
02:52:27,479 --> 02:52:29,039
of this campaign that can also

3631
02:52:29,039 --> 02:52:31,909
help enough not

3632
02:52:31,909 --> 02:52:35,549
lastly and not to eat me any longer

3633
02:52:35,549 --> 02:52:37,890
I would like to show you a little about

3634
02:52:37,890 --> 02:52:40,409
also how it looks like malicious traffic that

3635
02:52:40,409 --> 02:52:42,839
it is encrypted and this is something that they had

3636
02:52:42,839 --> 02:52:45,180
commented at the beginning much of this

3637
02:52:45,180 --> 02:52:47,729
traffic that we are going to see encrypted

3638
02:52:47,729 --> 02:52:49,409
we need keys to do it

3639
02:52:49,409 --> 02:52:51,180
decipher and it is important that we

3640
02:52:51,180 --> 02:52:53,430
Let's know this is something we've seen

3641
02:52:53,430 --> 02:52:56,999
quite this is the traffic that you go that

3642
02:52:56,999 --> 02:52:58,859
It goes encrypted and that Google detects that it goes

3643
02:52:58,859 --> 02:53:01,859
encrypted this this page let's say or this

3644
02:53:01,859 --> 02:53:03,869
statistics takes it out year after year and

3645
02:53:03,869 --> 02:53:05,489
we have seen a very very large increase

3646
02:53:05,489 --> 02:53:07,469
when we see countries of

3647
02:53:07,469 --> 02:53:09,299
Latin America and there for example

3648
02:53:09,299 --> 02:53:12,450
I put in Mexico it is said that more than 94

3649
02:53:12,450 --> 02:53:14,250
and this was two years ago of traffic going

3650
02:53:14,250 --> 02:53:16,230
encryption then it is important that

3651
02:53:16,230 --> 02:53:19,320
we understand what we need

3652
02:53:19,320 --> 02:53:21,120
certain types of devices that

3653
02:53:21,120 --> 02:53:22,710
help to decipher this

3654
02:53:22,710 --> 02:53:25,470
information to be able to inspect it and be able

3655
02:53:25,470 --> 02:53:27,450
detect anomalies by means of a motor

3656
02:53:27,450 --> 02:53:30,950
of malware from sbs signatures or others

3657
02:53:30,950 --> 02:53:34,050
So to give you an idea of

3658
02:53:34,050 --> 02:53:35,990
How does this work

3659
02:53:35,990 --> 02:53:38,670
if I wanted to show you how it looks

3660
02:53:38,670 --> 02:53:41,280
traffic going encrypted through lathe

3661
02:53:41,280 --> 02:53:44,010
and you can learn everything within

3662
02:53:44,010 --> 02:53:45,960
your computer and start analyzing

3663
02:53:45,960 --> 02:53:48,540
traffic will surely see something like

3664
02:53:48,540 --> 02:53:51,120
this that is here does not work if we

3665
02:53:51,120 --> 02:53:52,650
we put our filter that says basic

3666
02:53:52,650 --> 02:53:54,931
We are going to see these domains that many

3667
02:53:54,931 --> 02:53:58,050
times are randomized ok

3668
02:53:58,050 --> 02:54:00,090
and we will even be able to see

3669
02:54:00,090 --> 02:54:02,811
Also, there are other types of

3670
02:54:02,811 --> 02:54:05,641
traffic that can go through ports not

3671
02:54:05,641 --> 02:54:08,010
standard then I can see let's say

3672
02:54:08,010 --> 02:54:10,440
destinations there are fish that are randomly hoisted

3673
02:54:10,440 --> 02:54:12,300
for how it works bull and domains that

3674
02:54:12,300 --> 02:54:14,040
They are randomized and often

3675
02:54:14,040 --> 02:54:16,021
can filter this information or

3676
02:54:16,021 --> 02:54:17,970
You can access information by

3677
02:54:17,970 --> 02:54:19,950
protocols or ports we are not even going

3678
02:54:19,950 --> 02:54:22,230
Let's see around here and you have to generate some

3679
02:54:22,230 --> 02:54:24,360
kind of changes or some kind of

3680
02:54:24,360 --> 02:54:27,109
customization within the profile no

3681
02:54:27,109 --> 02:54:30,050
nothing else I highly recommend the

3682
02:54:30,050 --> 02:54:31,909
tool how are you I know right now

3683
02:54:31,909 --> 02:54:33,829
we took an hour but they exist

3684
02:54:33,829 --> 02:54:35,390
tools as it is for that total

3685
02:54:35,390 --> 02:54:37,520
that you can upload your files

3686
02:54:37,520 --> 02:54:39,470
you can upload your captures and it will give you

3687
02:54:39,470 --> 02:54:42,409
enough information as long as and

3688
02:54:42,409 --> 02:54:44,029
considering that the information

3689
02:54:44,029 --> 02:54:45,859
that you use you go there because it will be

3690
02:54:45,859 --> 02:54:47,300
public character and someone can

3691
02:54:47,300 --> 02:54:49,159
download these screenshots if you have

3692
02:54:49,159 --> 02:54:51,949
traffic from your organization and not

3693
02:54:51,949 --> 02:54:53,449
you are allowed to upload it because there is

3694
02:54:53,449 --> 02:54:56,029
confidential information not really

3695
02:54:56,029 --> 02:54:57,770
you go up this way you have to do it

3696
02:54:57,770 --> 02:55:00,199
Let's say manually like any

3697
02:55:00,199 --> 02:55:03,590
analyst would not and well I think

3698
02:55:03,590 --> 02:55:06,229
that we are in time really the idea

3699
02:55:06,229 --> 02:55:08,209
is that you know that with guards

3700
02:55:08,209 --> 02:55:10,189
we can do many things we can re

3701
02:55:10,189 --> 02:55:12,379
assemble many packages we can

3702
02:55:12,379 --> 02:55:14,629
use tools like virustotal

3703
02:55:14,629 --> 02:55:17,119
that they will be able to help us to validate if

3704
02:55:17,119 --> 02:55:19,729
some kind of file or artifact inside

3705
02:55:19,729 --> 02:55:21,619
of the network is malicious and to be able to understand

3706
02:55:21,619 --> 02:55:23,749
what does he do, let's say some

3707
02:55:23,749 --> 02:55:25,909
type of exploitation and well

3708
02:55:25,909 --> 02:55:27,399
Really

3709
02:55:27,399 --> 02:55:29,539
I am very grateful to be able to be

3710
02:55:29,539 --> 02:55:31,609
here with you if you have any

3711
02:55:31,609 --> 02:55:34,140
question look for emails there I put my

3712
02:55:34,140 --> 02:55:36,840
on twitter and linkedin we are there

3713
02:55:36,840 --> 02:55:38,279
very active the catches are

3714
02:55:38,279 --> 02:55:40,620
available to you and well

3715
02:55:40,620 --> 02:55:42,300
Jaime I think I'm on time

3716
02:55:42,300 --> 02:55:44,399
I just don't think they don't take away for

3717
02:55:44,399 --> 02:55:46,590
more than a minute then well many

3718
02:55:46,590 --> 02:55:50,090
thank you very much and arturo

3719
02:55:50,090 --> 02:55:52,979
actually the weather is fine but

3720
02:55:52,979 --> 02:55:55,319
we bring you a little delay for

3721
02:55:55,319 --> 02:55:57,239
various drawbacks in

3722
02:55:57,239 --> 02:56:01,109
transmission which is going to force us to

3723
02:56:01,109 --> 02:56:02,790
leave the questions for the networks

3724
02:56:02,790 --> 02:56:05,100
I'm going to send them to you then

3725
02:56:05,100 --> 02:56:08,670
by private we have quite a list

3726
02:56:08,670 --> 02:56:10,500
great questions the truth is that

3727
02:56:10,500 --> 02:56:13,649
as you said it yourself can be summed up by

3728
02:56:13,649 --> 02:56:16,409
least six months of master classes

3729
02:56:16,409 --> 02:56:19,779
in an hour very well very well done

3730
02:56:19,779 --> 02:56:21,819
I just want to give you the space

3731
02:56:21,819 --> 02:56:24,249
the public is yours whatever you want and

3732
02:56:24,249 --> 02:56:25,359
for you with we have with our

3733
02:56:25,359 --> 02:56:27,210
programming

3734
02:56:27,210 --> 02:56:29,400
perfect, thank you very much everyone

3735
02:56:29,400 --> 02:56:32,130
these types of events are very good as

3736
02:56:32,130 --> 02:56:33,900
I put it there on the screen

3737
02:56:33,900 --> 02:56:36,479
information changes situations is

3738
02:56:36,479 --> 02:56:38,340
our duty as professionals to be

3739
02:56:38,340 --> 02:56:40,950
disseminating information and participating in

3740
02:56:40,950 --> 02:56:43,740
a forum as big as this is the best

3741
02:56:43,740 --> 02:56:45,660
way to do it let's not continue working

3742
02:56:45,660 --> 02:56:48,840
as a team and yes, well, there are groups

3743
02:56:48,840 --> 02:56:51,060
organized cybercriminals should also

3744
02:56:51,060 --> 02:56:53,370
if there are groups of cyber defenders

3745
02:56:53,370 --> 02:56:55,050
organized and well, I think it is

3746
02:56:55,050 --> 02:56:57,330
community is a great example this many

3747
02:56:57,330 --> 02:56:58,830
thanks and whatever we are

3748
02:56:58,830 --> 02:57:01,580
out there in contact

3749
02:57:08,090 --> 02:57:10,880
no problem we have ana isabel

3750
02:57:10,880 --> 02:57:13,580
Corral is already Spanish and comes to

3751
02:57:13,580 --> 02:57:15,170
talk a little bit about engineering

3752
02:57:15,170 --> 02:57:18,760
social and different related topics

3753
02:57:18,760 --> 02:57:20,660
really is a person who too

3754
02:57:20,660 --> 02:57:23,899
I admire a lot not only for everything

3755
02:57:23,899 --> 02:57:26,960
What does the community contribute? Do you see it involved?

3756
02:57:26,960 --> 02:57:30,170
in different groups contributing supporting

3757
02:57:30,170 --> 02:57:34,340
and doing tasks that many times

3758
02:57:34,340 --> 02:57:36,590
let's say for different reasons a lot

3759
02:57:36,590 --> 02:57:38,630
people stop doing either for reasons

3760
02:57:38,630 --> 02:57:41,149
work due to lack of time but already

3761
02:57:41,149 --> 02:57:42,950
is still there pending and supporting the

3762
02:57:42,950 --> 02:57:44,960
community and you already know something to admire

3763
02:57:44,960 --> 02:57:47,960
quite anna i leave you the public is all

great manager things I have reduced a

3789
02:59:01,770 --> 02:59:03,960
little bio because if it was not known if

3790
02:59:03,960 --> 02:59:07,190
we are going to be here enough data

3791
02:59:07,190 --> 02:59:10,280
okay the first thing I consider is to talk

3792

What is bicing? It's worth it in case you don't know.

3794
02:59:16,820 --> 02:59:18,891
although I believe that the majority do

3795
02:59:18,891 --> 02:59:20,660
Interested in source intelligence

3796
02:59:20,660 --> 02:59:23,000
open or who its smart and is the

3797
02:59:23,000 --> 02:59:25,580
knowledge collected apart from

3798
02:59:25,580 --> 02:59:27,110
publicly accessible sources i.e.

3799
02:59:27,110 --> 02:59:30,230
we may collect information from google

3800
02:59:30,230 --> 02:59:32,760
from linkedin from

3801
02:59:32,760 --> 02:59:36,300
any application you can think of

3802
02:59:36,300 --> 02:59:37,800
any place will always be one

3803
02:59:37,800 --> 02:59:40,890
open source and we can take from there

3804
02:59:40,890 --> 02:59:42,750
everything to finish all the data that

3805
02:59:42,750 --> 02:59:44,510
we have

3806
02:59:44,510 --> 02:59:46,880
the you my intelligence that comes from

3807
02:59:46,880 --> 02:59:49,100
the information obtained and provided by

3808
02:59:49,100 --> 02:59:50,710
human sources

3809
02:59:50,710 --> 02:59:53,090
It can also be known as the old 'l

3810
02:59:53,090 --> 02:59:53,890
lace curtain

3811
02:59:53,890 --> 02:59:56,479
there will always be someone willing

3812
02:59:56,479 --> 02:59:59,359
to talk whenever you can

3813
02:59:59,359 --> 03:00:02,479
persuade well and get through that

3814
03:00:02,479 --> 03:00:04,490
person or by a group of people

3815
03:00:04,490 --> 03:00:07,420
information that interests us

3816
03:00:07,420 --> 03:00:10,060
and finally we have the bicing that

3817
03:00:10,060 --> 03:00:11,620
consists of the use of the line

3818
03:00:11,620 --> 03:00:13,080
conventional telephone

3819
03:00:13,080 --> 03:00:15,970
coupled with social engineering to

3820
03:00:15,970 --> 03:00:18,040
fool people and get

3821
03:00:18,040 --> 03:00:22,150
sensitive information is valid because everything

3822
03:00:22,150 --> 03:00:24,810
this is true that we have

3823
03:00:24,810 --> 03:00:27,520
I have already found many scams

3824
03:00:27,520 --> 03:00:29,550
put here two very clear examples

3825
03:00:29,550 --> 03:00:31,689
Here in Spain, above all, they are

3826
03:00:31,689 --> 03:00:33,970
seeing these two a lot if they call you by

3827
03:00:33,970 --> 03:00:35,770
telephone the name of the council of

3828
03:00:35,770 --> 03:00:38,410
health by asking you a questionnaire about

3829
03:00:38,410 --> 03:00:40,570
the kobe 19 or why you have to wear

3830
03:00:40,570 --> 03:00:42,700
in a fourth dose and they start asking you

3831
03:00:42,700 --> 03:00:46,930
data is one is or if you receive the typical

3832
03:00:46,930 --> 03:00:48,490
technical service call

3833
03:00:48,490 --> 03:00:51,070
Microsoft to tell you that you have a

3834
03:00:51,070 --> 03:00:52,630
virus in the computer and that they are going to

3835
03:00:52,630 --> 03:00:55,300
connecting remotely is another stage and only

3836
03:00:55,300 --> 03:00:57,580
your data comes, which is equivalent to money

3837
03:00:57,580 --> 03:01:00,760
because we always talk that the whole data

3838
03:01:00,760 --> 03:01:03,220
our dump on the internet can be

3839
03:01:03,220 --> 03:01:05,770
used against us to obtain

3840
03:01:05,770 --> 03:01:07,540
money

3841
03:01:07,540 --> 03:01:11,470
okay but not everything is this and here you are

3842
03:01:11,470 --> 03:01:13,720
I want to tell a little story

3843
03:01:13,720 --> 03:01:15,610
a long time ago before i got into

3844
03:01:15,610 --> 03:01:18,310
this world and in previous worlds I have

3845
03:01:18,310 --> 03:01:21,160
I have already had a lot of filming, I have dedicated myself to

3846
03:01:21,160 --> 03:01:22,840
concentration of visits with high

3847
03:01:22,840 --> 03:01:25,530
management positions in order to

3848
03:01:25,530 --> 03:01:28,540
get a visit for guy

3849
03:01:28,540 --> 03:01:31,210
commercial for that they were used

3850
03:01:31,210 --> 03:01:33,479
precisely these three techniques

3851
03:01:33,479 --> 03:01:35,939
both the and as it was being collected

3852
03:01:35,939 --> 03:01:38,100
information to find the public

3853
03:01:38,100 --> 03:01:38,840
aim

3854
03:01:38,840 --> 03:01:42,270
both the what um and why information

3855
03:01:42,270 --> 03:01:45,689
that we were missing we finished them at

3856
03:01:45,689 --> 03:01:47,189
people we talked to

3857
03:01:47,189 --> 03:01:49,300
phone the first time

3858
03:01:49,300 --> 03:01:52,140
and bicing because you want it not

3859
03:01:52,140 --> 03:01:54,580
the techniques we used were not

3860
03:01:54,580 --> 03:01:57,670
too clean we pretend that we don't

3861
03:01:57,670 --> 03:02:00,040
they knew from before to be able to pass the

3862
03:02:00,040 --> 03:02:02,680
call filter and thus can

3863
03:02:02,680 --> 03:02:07,180
getting that visit is worth skipping

3864
03:02:07,180 --> 03:02:08,800
a call filter is very

3865
03:02:08,800 --> 03:02:11,949
important to always speak confidently

3866
03:02:11,949 --> 03:02:16,449
have telephone smile make see that

3867
03:02:16,449 --> 03:02:18,479
are waiting for that call

3868
03:02:18,479 --> 03:02:21,279
be very careful with the times

3869
03:02:21,279 --> 03:02:24,939
verbal we are going to see now have

3870
03:02:24,939 --> 03:02:26,919
anticipated any situation so as not to

3871
03:02:26,919 --> 03:02:29,109
blank out and grab their attention

3872
03:02:29,109 --> 03:02:32,799
immediately good for all this

3873
03:02:32,799 --> 03:02:34,479
techniques are very important

3874
03:02:34,479 --> 03:02:35,279
persuasion

3875
03:02:35,279 --> 03:02:38,440
that simply

3876
03:02:38,440 --> 03:02:41,790
can be defined as

3877
03:02:41,790 --> 03:02:43,960
how to use words

3878
03:02:43,960 --> 03:02:47,230
appropriate stage presence

3879
03:02:47,230 --> 03:02:50,740
charisma and mental techniques to

3880
03:02:50,740 --> 03:02:52,150
get the person with what

3881
03:02:52,150 --> 03:02:54,400
we are talking she is so

3882
03:02:54,400 --> 03:02:55,870
face-to-face or by phone

3883
03:02:55,870 --> 03:02:59,080
I want the same thing as you but what do I know

3884
03:02:59,080 --> 03:03:01,061
I think that she is the one who is drinking

3885
03:03:01,061 --> 03:03:03,671
that decision or the one who has reached that

3886
03:03:03,671 --> 03:03:06,521
conclusion is a good way to

3887
03:03:06,521 --> 03:03:09,341
learn to manage people and

3888
03:03:09,341 --> 03:03:12,160
do what you want if even

3889
03:03:12,160 --> 03:03:15,070
persuasion and add the data that

3890
03:03:15,070 --> 03:03:17,710
we have located using the techniques

3891
03:03:17,710 --> 03:03:20,591
özil we will have absolute control of the

3892
03:03:20,591 --> 03:03:22,841
conversation because we are going to have all

3893
03:03:22,841 --> 03:03:25,120
the information necessary to be able

3894
03:03:25,120 --> 03:03:27,450
reach our goal

3895
03:03:27,450 --> 03:03:29,040
We have seen that social networks

3896
03:03:29,040 --> 03:03:31,590
allow information to be obtained

3897
03:03:31,590 --> 03:03:33,681
ease birthday date

3898
03:03:33,681 --> 03:03:37,860
hobbies tastes and ideologies travel

3899
03:03:37,860 --> 03:03:40,800
past present future have been

3900
03:03:40,800 --> 03:03:43,650
in a congress with whom they have been and

3901
03:03:43,650 --> 03:03:45,811
we will be able to use all that

3902
03:03:45,811 --> 03:03:48,840
information for our benefit and other

3903
03:03:48,840 --> 03:03:51,030
The fact that we have to keep in mind is

3904
03:03:51,030 --> 03:03:53,851
soon we have to be aware

3905
03:03:53,851 --> 03:03:56,730
that people are always very

3906
03:03:56,730 --> 03:04:00,090
busy throughout the day and if not

3907
03:04:00,090 --> 03:04:02,280
They are going to try to pretend that they are

3908
03:04:02,280 --> 03:04:05,641
because time is worth money time

3909
03:04:05,641 --> 03:04:09,601
it's gold so let's not try

3910
03:04:09,601 --> 03:04:12,870
convince a person with great

3911
03:04:12,870 --> 03:04:15,630
colloquiums with great talks because

3912
03:04:15,630 --> 03:04:17,851
the two minutes will try to hang up

3913
03:04:17,851 --> 03:04:20,340
call our interrupting then

3914
03:04:20,340 --> 03:04:23,250
you have to go sack so to speak to

3915
03:04:23,250 --> 03:04:26,370
let the call go wherever you want

3916
03:04:26,370 --> 03:04:28,920
and not lose control and not lose control

3917
03:04:28,920 --> 03:04:31,439
interest of the other person

3918
03:04:31,439 --> 03:04:33,779
We have seen that these techniques are

3919
03:04:33,779 --> 03:04:38,459
they use in marketing and are legal but

3920
03:04:38,459 --> 03:04:41,300
we can make it not

3921
03:04:41,300 --> 03:04:43,930
well here in spain

3922
03:04:43,930 --> 03:04:46,540
we use a lot

3923
03:04:46,540 --> 03:04:49,970
a tool is publicly accessible

3924
03:04:49,970 --> 03:04:52,130
calls camr data which is a file of

3925
03:04:52,130 --> 03:04:54,229
Spanish companies are collected here

3926
03:04:54,229 --> 03:04:57,229
absolutely all companies and

3927
03:04:57,229 --> 03:04:58,850
you can filter by activity code

3928
03:04:58,850 --> 03:05:02,359
by type of company by name year

3929
03:05:02,359 --> 03:05:03,520
of constitution

3930
03:05:03,520 --> 03:05:06,970
billing number of employees from where

3931
03:05:06,970 --> 03:05:09,830
absolutely everything then is what I know

3932
03:05:09,830 --> 03:05:13,310
usually do is filter an objective what

3933
03:05:13,310 --> 03:05:17,020
I want a company that bills between

3934
03:05:17,020 --> 03:05:20,780
2 and 5 million euros per year that

3935
03:05:20,780 --> 03:05:23,770
have 50 to 100 workers

3936
03:05:23,770 --> 03:05:26,149
that has branches that do not

3937
03:05:26,149 --> 03:05:28,850
absolutely the profile that I am

3938
03:05:28,850 --> 03:05:30,940
searching

3939
03:05:30,940 --> 03:05:33,460
what are we going to do with that data in that

3940
03:05:33,460 --> 03:05:35,290
web will tell us a list of

3941
03:05:35,290 --> 03:05:37,900
companies with their phone number where

3942
03:05:37,900 --> 03:05:40,721
is the headquarters absolutely everything then

3943
03:05:40,721 --> 03:05:43,030
It's as simple as pulling linkedin

3944
03:05:43,030 --> 03:05:45,580
to try to find information

3945
03:05:45,580 --> 03:05:47,261
profile that interests us if we want

3946
03:05:47,261 --> 03:05:49,841
talk to the CEO

3947
03:05:49,841 --> 03:05:51,551
human resources manager with

3948
03:05:51,551 --> 03:05:55,240
director of the itd with whom we have to

3949
03:05:55,240 --> 03:05:59,311
try to sneak what we want

3950
03:06:00,859 --> 03:06:03,619
and through hunter point io we can

3951
03:06:03,619 --> 03:06:05,629
locate email address

3952
03:06:05,629 --> 03:06:09,169
email from that company and not just from

3953
03:06:09,169 --> 03:06:10,909
the company in general usually come

3954
03:06:10,909 --> 03:06:14,029
registered all or almost all those who

3955
03:06:14,029 --> 03:06:16,669
live on the web both above and

3956
03:06:16,669 --> 03:06:19,069
below because we know that all

3957
03:06:19,069 --> 03:06:22,459
websites have some metadata that in the end

3958
03:06:22,459 --> 03:06:24,619
Just all filtered and dumped in these

3959
03:06:24,619 --> 03:06:29,169
pages the top week has left me

3960
03:06:30,740 --> 03:06:32,420
Let's see for a second that I have done something strange

3961
03:06:32,420 --> 03:06:34,540
the computer

3962
03:06:34,540 --> 03:06:39,150
a novel talk novel

3963
03:06:45,630 --> 03:06:49,220
Let's see for a second that you haven't missed it

3964
03:06:58,150 --> 03:07:02,609
we keep looking for

3965
03:07:02,920 --> 03:07:06,070
according to dyn

3966
03:07:17,439 --> 03:07:19,630
to designs

3967
03:07:19,630 --> 03:07:23,550
ready in space i'm in a hurry

3968
03:07:39,990 --> 03:07:41,820
now the net screen has remained

3969
03:07:41,820 --> 03:07:44,010
of all

3970
03:07:44,010 --> 03:07:45,890
if you want you

3971
03:07:45,890 --> 03:07:48,899
We wait for these data that I have for you

3972
03:07:48,899 --> 03:07:52,080
and go back, sorry when

3973
03:07:52,080 --> 03:07:55,470
calm down no problem

3974
03:07:55,470 --> 03:07:58,140
well, while she heals, she'll come back

3975
03:07:58,140 --> 03:08:00,930
answer some questions that we have

3976
03:08:00,930 --> 03:08:05,250
fact the first one is if we are going to

3977
03:08:05,250 --> 03:08:08,550
issue attendance certificates

3978
03:08:08,550 --> 03:08:10,590
ron to the circuit conference and the

3979
03:08:10,590 --> 03:08:13,319
answer is yes indeed we are going to

3980
03:08:13,319 --> 03:08:17,130
do that let's send an email

3981
03:08:17,130 --> 03:08:18,870
email if they are not registered in

3982
03:08:18,870 --> 03:08:20,220
the mailing list because they get into

3983
03:08:20,220 --> 03:08:22,560
work with heretic point and are performed

3984
03:08:22,560 --> 03:08:24,239
there because by that means that we are going

3985
03:08:24,239 --> 03:08:26,189
to send the information to the

3986
03:08:26,189 --> 03:08:28,750
certificate

3987
03:08:28,750 --> 03:08:30,610
they are not only out to certify

3988
03:08:30,610 --> 03:08:32,710
for this edition but all our

3989
03:08:32,710 --> 03:08:35,170
editions from the first we already have

3990
03:08:35,170 --> 03:08:37,600
nine years is amazing what is that

3991
03:08:37,600 --> 03:08:39,220
we've been online for nine years

3992
03:08:39,220 --> 03:08:42,010
uninterrupted and simultaneous

3993
03:08:42,010 --> 03:08:43,220
[Music]

3994
03:08:43,220 --> 03:08:45,590
They have also told us what is happening

3995
03:08:45,590 --> 03:08:48,140
with whatsapp messages many people

3996
03:08:48,140 --> 03:08:50,330
I really appreciated this experiment

3997
03:08:50,330 --> 03:08:52,520
we were doing with whatsapp well

3998
03:08:52,520 --> 03:08:54,680
It seems that meta did not like it very much

3999
03:08:54,680 --> 03:08:57,950
the content we were sending by

4000
03:08:57,950 --> 03:08:59,540
So deal with security issues.

4001
03:08:59,540 --> 03:09:01,550
computer science we are talking about solving

4002
03:09:01,550 --> 03:09:03,380
that little inconvenience for so

4003
03:09:03,380 --> 03:09:04,850
afternoon

4004
03:09:04,850 --> 03:09:07,189
we can come back with whatsapp theme

4005
03:09:07,189 --> 03:09:10,160
but meanwhile even though we

4006
03:09:10,160 --> 03:09:12,350
follow on social networks you will be

4007
03:09:12,350 --> 03:09:14,569
aware of everything that is happening

4008
03:09:14,569 --> 03:09:17,739
with the event they have also asked us

4009
03:09:17,739 --> 03:09:20,810
some people with the ctf issue

4010
03:09:20,810 --> 03:09:23,540
Well, we have already been told that those registered

4011
03:09:23,540 --> 03:09:26,630
they have exceeded 100 people that

4012
03:09:26,630 --> 03:09:29,750
I am very glad we have a good list of

4013
03:09:29,750 --> 03:09:31,160
prizes you can find in the

4014
03:09:31,160 --> 03:09:34,939
page dragonheart dot rocks dotcom

4015
03:09:34,939 --> 03:09:37,220
the same if they are seeing this in different

4016
03:09:37,220 --> 03:09:39,350
transmissions because in the chat they are

4017
03:09:39,350 --> 03:09:41,450
sending the links of each one of the

4018
03:09:41,450 --> 03:09:43,520
things that I am telling you is

4019
03:09:43,520 --> 03:09:45,859
true another very frequent question that

4020
03:09:45,859 --> 03:09:48,590
they are making us is we are going to have

4021
03:09:48,590 --> 03:09:51,530
This is light from the different talks

4022
03:09:51,530 --> 03:09:53,270
It is already at the discretion of each of the

4023
03:09:53,270 --> 03:09:55,880
speakers some make them public

4024
03:09:55,880 --> 03:09:58,189
others do not make them public but do

4025
03:09:58,189 --> 03:10:00,020
follow on their social networks that all

4026
03:10:00,020 --> 03:10:02,810
are on the event page because

4027
03:10:02,810 --> 03:10:05,000
most likely they after their

4028
03:10:05,000 --> 03:10:07,430
talk they are sending the likes for that

4029
03:10:07,430 --> 03:10:09,200
medium and if they are not sending them then

4030
03:10:09,200 --> 03:10:10,609
you can write to them you can ask them

4031
03:10:10,609 --> 03:10:13,460
always interested in sharing

4032
03:10:13,460 --> 03:10:17,180
Internet content that more questions

4033
03:10:17,180 --> 03:10:18,680
they are doing us good

4034
03:10:18,680 --> 03:10:21,649
asking about him

4035
03:10:21,649 --> 03:10:24,410
contest we have a list of

4036
03:10:24,410 --> 03:10:29,530
topics I will try to show you a little

4037
03:10:35,870 --> 03:10:37,880
people should be has commanded us

4038
03:10:37,880 --> 03:10:40,820
licenses many licenses so that

4039
03:10:40,820 --> 03:10:43,790
let's share some among all of you

4040
03:10:43,790 --> 03:10:47,090
of them will be distributed through

4041
03:10:47,090 --> 03:10:49,970
of a form that has been sent by

4042
03:10:49,970 --> 03:10:52,610
the youtube chat and the chat of

4043
03:10:52,610 --> 03:10:54,670
good tweets for the different chats

4044
03:10:54,670 --> 03:10:58,190
but others will be used as in

4045
03:10:58,190 --> 03:11:00,130
previous years with different dynamics

4046
03:11:00,130 --> 03:11:02,360
this year the first dynamic that

4047
03:11:02,360 --> 03:11:03,740
we have come up with these

4048
03:11:03,740 --> 03:11:05,420
dynamics are not programmed nor are they

4049
03:11:05,420 --> 03:11:07,851
planned is that we saw some

4050
03:11:07,851 --> 03:11:09,650
your initiatives thanks to the kit

4051

press that they are going to send you in the

4052
03:11:11,690 --> 03:11:13,390
making chat

4053
03:11:13,390 --> 03:11:15,970
of people who have generated memes very

4054
03:11:15,970 --> 03:11:17,859
event related funny

4055
03:11:17,859 --> 03:11:19,109
so then

4056
03:11:19,109 --> 03:11:22,449
to the best I m ​​with better reception then

4057

We are going to deliver one of these

4058

03:11:30,130 --> 03:11:32,030
That's wrong

4062
03:11:32,030 --> 03:11:34,490
but you can share the screen

4063
03:11:34,490 --> 03:11:36,380
screen behaves it I share it without

4064
03:11:36,380 --> 03:11:37,800
problems

4065
03:11:37,800 --> 03:11:39,369

4076
03:12:22,550 --> 03:12:25,970

03:14:37,431 --> 03:14:40,181
go look for the poor man

4125
03:14:40,181 --> 03:14:41,760
all right

4126
03:14:41,760 --> 03:14:45,600
I already have a name from the director and it is the

4127
03:14:45,600 --> 03:14:47,640
person I want to talk to

4128
03:14:47,640 --> 03:14:51,090
to see if I can get sant carles and all

4129
03:14:51,090 --> 03:14:52,770
the information you want to give me because

4130
03:14:52,770 --> 03:14:54,270
after all, they are the ones

4131
03:14:54,270 --> 03:14:56,000
speak

4132
03:14:56,000 --> 03:14:58,310
He told me that he is in a meeting, he told me

4133
03:14:58,310 --> 03:14:59,840
that he is out of the office and that he already

4134
03:14:59,840 --> 03:15:02,480
I said I'll call you back in 20

4135
03:15:02,480 --> 03:15:04,130
minutes

4136
03:15:04,130 --> 03:15:07,189
in our cases it is not usually called in

4137
03:15:07,189 --> 03:15:09,170
that franc in that time frame

4138
03:15:09,170 --> 03:15:10,720
established

4139
03:15:10,720 --> 03:15:13,310
trying not to remember you too much

4140
03:15:13,310 --> 03:15:15,200
when creating a name in a

4141
03:15:15,200 --> 03:15:16,370
fictitious name you also have to

4142
03:15:16,370 --> 03:15:20,240
look for a name that is very normal very

4143
03:15:20,240 --> 03:15:22,640
usual in the country in i festes so that

4144
03:15:22,640 --> 03:15:26,180
do not jump the hare and do not remind you what

4145
03:15:26,180 --> 03:15:28,460
important is to arrive and not leave

4146
03:15:28,460 --> 03:15:30,290
footprints and retain

4147
03:15:30,290 --> 03:15:33,069

4149
03:15:35,949 --> 03:15:39,159

03:15:39,159 --> 03:15:41,560

4179
03:17:21,860 --> 03:17:23,870

4180
03:17:23,870 --> 03:17:25,610
Call obtained to provide me with your

4181
03:17:25,610 --> 03:17:28,390
mobile phone number

4182
03:17:28,390 --> 03:17:31,600
and there are two possibilities or that they give it to you

4183
03:17:31,600 --> 03:17:33,930
directly as they have done now

4184
03:17:33,930 --> 03:17:37,060
or request that the call be diverted

4185
03:17:37,060 --> 03:17:39,250
in the face of an emergency that is waiting for me

4186
03:17:39,250 --> 03:17:41,680
called it is very important that I remain today

4187
03:17:41,680 --> 03:17:45,430

4188
03:17:45,430 --> 03:17:47,350
you two days the call you can have

4189
03:17:47,350 --> 03:17:50,290
good luck and when I tell you that being reunited

4190
03:17:50,290 --> 03:17:52,359
outside that the answering machine skips

4191
03:17:52,359 --> 03:17:55,359
automatic and many people do not tell you the

4192
03:17:55,359 --> 03:17:58,600
typical message hello I'm anna leave your

4193
03:17:58,600 --> 03:18:01,659
message if I don't call 6 I don't know

4194
03:18:01,659 --> 03:18:03,370
which one we stop of how much is to say of

4195
03:18:03,370 --> 03:18:05,739
his message with which to her too

4196
03:18:05,739 --> 03:18:08,380
I would have your phone number

4197
03:18:08,380 --> 03:18:13,090
those of you who handle a little ozzy themes or

4198
03:18:13,090 --> 03:18:15,880
simply from hacking you have already read and

4199
03:18:15,880 --> 03:18:18,640
you have informed yourself a little through

4200
03:18:18,640 --> 03:18:20,020
from a phone number you can

4201
03:18:20,020 --> 03:18:21,520
locate email addresses

4202
03:18:21,520 --> 03:18:24,399
email where you are registered

4203
03:18:24,399 --> 03:18:25,630
which is also quite a piece of information

4204
03:18:25,630 --> 03:18:29,519
important to keep in mind

4205
03:18:29,540 --> 03:18:31,409
OK

4206
03:18:31,409 --> 03:18:34,770
and since I already have the goal I'm going to try

4207
03:18:34,770 --> 03:18:37,199
Good luck and I'll call the mobile number

4208
03:18:37,199 --> 03:18:38,759
that has made it easier for me to see if I can

4209
03:18:38,759 --> 03:18:42,090
talk to federico

4211
03:18:58,060 --> 03:19:00,850

03:19:00,850 --> 03:19:04,729
I am María López from living and we met

4213
03:19:04,729 --> 03:19:07,609

4214
03:19:07,609 --> 03:19:09,290

So

[Music]

4219
03:19:18,420 --> 03:19:22,180
Ok, you don't know me at all, but

4220
03:19:22,180 --> 03:19:24,040
tell him that we have been together in the

4221
03:19:24,040 --> 03:19:27,610
clear event among so many people a native

4222
03:19:27,610 --> 03:19:30,790
Maria, well, it can strain perfectly.

4223
03:19:30,790 --> 03:19:33,460
a very common name

4224
03:19:33,460 --> 03:19:35,890
I don't know if you remember that I told you that the

4225
03:19:35,890 --> 03:19:37,630
The company I work for is dedicated to

4226
03:19:37,630 --> 03:19:39,880
firewall installation and you looked so

4227
03:19:39,880 --> 03:19:42,520
interested, that's why I'm calling, we want

4228
03:19:42,520 --> 03:19:44,110
make a budget without commitment

4229
03:19:44,110 --> 03:19:46,240
of course through the visit of

4230
03:19:46,240 --> 03:19:48,430
our director and that you can value it

4231
03:19:48,430 --> 03:19:50,440
quietly we're just going to rob you

4232
03:19:50,440 --> 03:19:52,750
a couple of minutes half an hour at the most

4233
03:19:52,750 --> 03:19:55,420
20 minutes and you would do me a big favor now

4234
03:19:55,420 --> 03:19:57,570
Do you know how things are lately?

4235
03:19:57,570 --> 03:20:02,740
Ok brevity I have gone to get what I

4236
03:20:02,740 --> 03:20:04,080
I want is

4237
03:20:04,080 --> 03:20:07,540
make a meeting with you for 20 minutes

4238
03:20:07,540 --> 03:20:10,600
few I dedicate myself to installing the

4239
03:20:10,600 --> 03:20:13,840
installation of firewalls and jolines

4240
03:20:13,840 --> 03:20:15,700
I'm going to be sorry because the sector

4241
03:20:15,700 --> 03:20:17,500
It is very complicated, you know it and it is

4242
03:20:17,500 --> 03:20:20,260
On top of that, they talked about their days in Las Vegas a

4243
03:20:20,260 --> 03:20:21,479
vengeful

4244
03:20:21,479 --> 03:20:25,400
harness it's over that we met

4245
03:20:25,400 --> 03:20:29,900
It's okay that I would be because the ones I had

4246
03:20:29,900 --> 03:20:32,931
Could it be, tell me that's why you can

4247
03:20:32,931 --> 03:20:35,570
be calm tell me what day and time

4248
03:20:35,570 --> 03:20:37,221
it is better for you by schedule and we

4249
03:20:37,221 --> 03:20:41,859
we adapt vouchers but when he looked

4250
03:20:42,649 --> 03:20:45,470
as I told you at the beginning before

4251
03:20:45,470 --> 03:20:48,609
that my screen died

4252
03:20:48,609 --> 03:20:51,409
time is money with which I

4253
03:20:51,409 --> 03:20:54,199
I am going to impose a date or be dizzy

4254
03:20:54,199 --> 03:20:56,090
the agenda up and down to

4255
03:20:56,090 --> 03:20:58,340
get to square no no no no you tell me

4256
03:20:58,340 --> 03:21:00,560
what day is better for you than not

4257
03:21:00,560 --> 03:21:02,539
Don't worry, it's all the same to us

4258
03:21:02,539 --> 03:21:05,149
the day you tell us we are there everything

4259
03:21:05,149 --> 03:21:07,609
be it for you, for your company, for your time

4260
03:21:07,609 --> 03:21:11,140
and absolutely for everyone

4261
03:21:11,530 --> 03:21:13,930
on Wednesday

4262
03:21:13,930 --> 03:21:16,300
Perfect, I'll leave it noted in the agenda

4263
03:21:16,300 --> 03:21:19,180
my director what I do need is

4264
03:21:19,180 --> 03:21:20,859
to confirm it is the data and not like that

4265
03:21:20,859 --> 03:21:22,330
make you waste so much time that day and

4266
03:21:22,330 --> 03:21:24,580
more knowing that you are so busy how many

4267
03:21:24,580 --> 03:21:27,110
computers do you have in the company

[Music]

4269
03:21:28,700 --> 03:21:30,380
I think we have nine teams with

4270
03:21:30,380 --> 03:21:32,030
windows 10

4271
03:21:32,030 --> 03:21:35,720
besides there is a server with windows 2003

4272
03:21:35,720 --> 03:21:38,990
they are all on the same network

4273
03:21:38,990 --> 03:21:41,480
firmware if I remember correctly is a front

4274
03:21:41,480 --> 03:21:44,271
when the marm license expires by doing

4275
03:21:44,271 --> 03:21:46,320
12 months

4276
03:21:46,320 --> 03:21:50,431
and well that way that would be the thing

4277
03:21:50,431 --> 03:21:54,141
ok I've been lucky

4278
03:21:54,141 --> 03:21:56,851
normally or it is more difficult for them to release the

4279
03:21:56,851 --> 03:21:58,440
information you do not find a rooster

4280
03:21:58,440 --> 03:22:00,331
singing like this that I wanted to

4281
03:22:00,331 --> 03:22:02,581
speak and practically without asking

4282
03:22:02,581 --> 03:22:04,141
has started to tell me absolutely

4283
03:22:04,141 --> 03:22:05,540
everything

4284
03:22:05,540 --> 03:22:08,330
it's more

4285
03:22:08,330 --> 03:22:10,550
It will provide me with all the information that I

4286
03:22:10,550 --> 03:22:13,529
they ask if you want give me an address

4287
03:22:13,529 --> 03:22:15,839
and he confirmed the data of the network and

4288
03:22:15,839 --> 03:22:18,959
I put a better description of everything

4289
03:22:18,959 --> 03:22:20,650
the same for what

4290
03:22:20,650 --> 03:22:22,420
It is more current, I don't know if it affects the

4291
03:22:22,420 --> 03:22:25,480
second take on her is perfect

4292
03:22:25,480 --> 03:22:27,460
pass me if you want your address

4293
03:22:27,460 --> 03:22:29,200
email and I'll send you everything

4294
03:22:29,200 --> 03:22:30,851
new all the questions in case you

4295
03:22:30,851 --> 03:22:32,500
He has forgotten some information and I'll send you

4296
03:22:32,500 --> 03:22:35,490
also the call

4297
03:22:42,670 --> 03:22:44,290
Perfect, so right now I'll send it to you

4298
03:22:44,290 --> 03:22:46,930

4299
03:22:46,930 --> 03:22:49,800
we take time we have a coffee

4300
03:22:49,800 --> 03:22:53,770
thank you very much and best regards

4301
03:22:53,770 --> 03:22:55,939
later

4302
03:22:55,939 --> 03:22:57,819
OK

4303
03:22:57,819 --> 03:23:01,220
He knows me too and everything has gone

4304
03:23:01,220 --> 03:23:04,670
also that he is willing to facilitate

4305
03:23:04,670 --> 03:23:07,069
my email meaning

4306
03:23:07,069 --> 03:23:09,289
apart from the mobile phone number that

4307
03:23:09,289 --> 03:23:11,209
I already have it first and last name all

4308
03:23:11,209 --> 03:23:14,120
data that you have posted on linkedin

4309
03:23:14,120 --> 03:23:16,040
and in the email that I

4310
03:23:16,040 --> 03:23:19,370
want to send if I get to send it to you in

4311
03:23:19,370 --> 03:23:21,260
this occasion and the meeting has been

4312
03:23:21,260 --> 03:23:22,649
cancelled

4313
03:23:22,649 --> 03:23:25,649
for reasons of my director's agenda

4314
03:23:25,649 --> 03:23:28,829
above provided in that email

4315
03:23:28,829 --> 03:23:30,560
electronic

4316
03:23:30,560 --> 03:23:32,989
I could have asked him for any kind of

4317
03:23:32,989 --> 03:23:35,960
fact that I am sure that I was going to

4318
03:23:35,960 --> 03:23:37,430
to ease

4319
03:23:37,430 --> 03:23:40,609
in that email there could be

4320
03:23:40,609 --> 03:23:43,609
tried luck and got into it

4321
03:23:43,609 --> 03:23:49,790
a document with a saying and the same are

4322
03:23:49,790 --> 03:23:53,271
to the plant and infected half the company

4323
03:23:53,271 --> 03:23:55,521
if I hadn't canceled the meeting with

4324
03:23:55,521 --> 03:23:58,160
our commercial director of the same

4325
03:23:58,160 --> 03:24:00,650
tomorrow a friend from the side shows up

4326
03:24:00,650 --> 03:24:02,390
Dark

4327
03:24:02,390 --> 03:24:05,540
is that the laptop is going badly with me

4328
03:24:05,540 --> 03:24:07,760
flash drive with the presentation of our

4329
03:24:07,760 --> 03:24:09,990
company on your computer

4330
03:24:09,990 --> 03:24:12,860
and we are inside

4331
03:24:12,860 --> 03:24:15,920
You have to be very careful and don't

4332
03:24:15,920 --> 03:24:18,921
trust absolutely no one

4333
03:24:18,921 --> 03:24:21,681
and much less commercial calls in

4334
03:24:21,681 --> 03:24:23,781
the ones that are going to try to get all the

4335
03:24:23,781 --> 03:24:25,641
information when they try to take you out

4336
03:24:25,641 --> 03:24:28,730
so many data strike and slav e

4337
03:24:28,730 --> 03:24:31,480
research

4338
03:24:32,050 --> 03:24:35,750
[Music]

4339
03:24:36,470 --> 03:24:39,439
and effectively and already to conclude the

4340
03:24:39,439 --> 03:24:42,439
preferred also follows a little fast in

4341
03:24:42,439 --> 03:24:44,689
time for us to go everyone is

4342
03:24:44,689 --> 03:24:47,510
so stuck behind the suggestions for

4343
03:24:47,510 --> 03:24:52,010
companies and also applicable for

4344
03:24:52,010 --> 03:24:54,080
all users due to the large number

4345
03:24:54,080 --> 03:24:55,939
of scam calls that are in the

4346
03:24:55,939 --> 03:24:59,120
currently do not give mobile number

4347
03:24:59,120 --> 03:25:01,700
I pay attention under no circumstances

4348
03:25:01,700 --> 03:25:03,439
provide any sensitive data for

4349
03:25:03,439 --> 03:25:06,200
telephone you know by noval interlocutor

4350
03:25:06,200 --> 03:25:09,170
We already know that he says that he is very

4351
03:25:09,170 --> 03:25:12,800
fashion lately in modifying a voice is

4352
03:25:12,800 --> 03:25:14,979
very simple and they can sneak it to you

4353
03:25:14,979 --> 03:25:17,180
Be careful what you share on networks

4354
03:25:17,180 --> 03:25:19,010
I was commenting on it the other day in

4355
03:25:19,010 --> 03:25:21,529
and linkedin that still surprised me

4356
03:25:21,529 --> 03:25:24,079
see a lot of people from the sector

4357
03:25:24,079 --> 03:25:26,539
share videos the work of miracles

4358
03:25:26,539 --> 03:25:28,459
technologies

4359
03:25:28,459 --> 03:25:30,049
and everything they use in the company

4360
03:25:30,049 --> 03:25:32,749
versions absolutely everything

4361
03:25:32,749 --> 03:25:35,000
commented another friend Fernando

4362
03:25:35,000 --> 03:25:38,750
I already said but it is normal because in

4363
03:25:38,750 --> 03:25:40,630
obscurantism

4364
03:25:40,630 --> 03:25:42,710
it's not good either

4365
03:25:42,710 --> 03:25:44,390
the bad guys know exactly what

4366
03:25:44,390 --> 03:25:46,229
we are using

4367
03:25:46,229 --> 03:25:49,829
but it is one thing to say that you use but

4368
03:25:49,829 --> 03:25:51,740
don't tell everything

4369
03:25:51,740 --> 03:25:54,000
and more in open

4370
03:25:54,000 --> 03:25:57,120
And if they don't give you contact information, I will

4371
03:25:57,120 --> 03:25:58,650
I have never left my number

4372
03:25:58,650 --> 03:26:01,050
telephone I called with a small group they do not have

4373
03:26:01,050 --> 03:26:02,490
email address has the

4374
03:26:02,490 --> 03:26:04,650
name of a company that is not above

4375
03:26:04,650 --> 03:26:06,570
very well pronounced so if I

4376
03:26:06,570 --> 03:26:08,250
he wants to look for me because he doesn't

4377
03:26:08,250 --> 03:26:09,920
he is going to find

4378
03:26:09,920 --> 03:26:12,560
if I were very bad and I was in

4379
03:26:12,560 --> 03:26:14,420
the other side would have created a profile

4380
03:26:14,420 --> 03:26:18,200
false with the company with people and with

4381
03:26:18,200 --> 03:26:21,260
everything and would practically hit the jack and

4382
03:26:21,260 --> 03:26:23,840
they would throw if they want if they want to check

4383
03:26:23,840 --> 03:26:26,720
the fast veracity of the company everything is

4384
03:26:26,720 --> 03:26:29,600
possible so be absolutely suspicious

4385
03:26:29,600 --> 03:26:34,330
everything and that's all thank you very much

4386
03:26:34,330 --> 03:26:36,840
thank you very much tiana as always

4387
03:26:36,840 --> 03:26:40,390
an impeccable intervention the truth is

4388
03:26:40,390 --> 03:26:43,930
that we have the chat and everything on fire until

4389
03:26:43,930 --> 03:26:46,000
many people with their mouths open and well

4390
03:26:46,000 --> 03:26:48,220
of course you have many questions

4391
03:26:48,220 --> 03:26:50,170
we are going to answer some of them if you

4392
03:26:50,170 --> 03:26:53,790
looks good to me

4393
03:26:54,380 --> 03:26:57,950
Well the first question is in Spain

4394
03:26:57,950 --> 03:27:00,130
they are so distrustful

4395
03:27:00,130 --> 03:27:02,030
Yeah

4396
03:27:02,030 --> 03:27:05,530
and the truth that

4397
03:27:05,771 --> 03:27:09,610
yes I was working in a company

4398
03:27:09,610 --> 03:27:13,010
I'm not going to mention it

4399
03:27:13,010 --> 03:27:16,819
but we used to do once upon a time

4400
03:27:16,819 --> 03:27:20,149
good side, that is, with real companies

4401
03:27:20,149 --> 03:27:22,220
real commercials that hire this

4402
03:27:22,220 --> 03:27:24,200
type of companies for precisely for

4403
03:27:24,200 --> 03:27:27,020
hiring visits

4404
03:27:27,020 --> 03:27:28,029
Y

4405
03:27:28,029 --> 03:27:32,180
we were doing an average of four

4406
03:27:32,180 --> 03:27:34,819
visits per hour

4407
03:27:34,819 --> 03:27:37,630
in 8 hour shifts

4408
03:27:37,630 --> 03:27:40,240
that is, if there is time to call a crowd

4409
03:27:40,240 --> 03:27:41,830
of companies but clear the bases of

4410
03:27:41,830 --> 03:27:43,510
data that we were generating through

4411
03:27:43,510 --> 03:27:45,710
palmer dating via linkedin

4412
03:27:45,710 --> 03:27:48,470
they were huge and then of course calls

4413
03:27:48,470 --> 03:27:50,450
calls calls calls and always

4414
03:27:50,450 --> 03:27:55,450
there was one that at the end of each day

4415
03:27:55,450 --> 03:27:57,550
here he is offering you a job as

4416
03:27:57,550 --> 03:28:00,521
Business at a technology company

4417
03:28:00,521 --> 03:28:03,480
for that we leave the link

4418
03:28:03,480 --> 03:28:07,710
ask if to be a woman

4419
03:28:07,710 --> 03:28:10,681
It helps a lot in these processes.

4420
03:28:10,681 --> 03:28:13,000
gathering of information if it generates

4421
03:28:13,000 --> 03:28:17,290
more confidence and stuff if more than

4422
03:28:17,290 --> 03:28:20,100
nothing Why

4423
03:28:20,100 --> 03:28:22,739
no matter how ugly the saying sounds and is

4424
03:28:22,739 --> 03:28:25,949
throw stones against my own roof in

4425
03:28:25,949 --> 03:28:27,869
these cases throw more two tits than the

4426
03:28:27,869 --> 03:28:30,479
reels and a sweet and feminine voice

4427
03:28:30,479 --> 03:28:33,989
you will always get better somewhere

4428
03:28:33,989 --> 03:28:37,350
person towards a male person and if

4429
03:28:37,350 --> 03:28:41,909
you are lucky or unlucky that

4430
03:28:41,909 --> 03:28:45,060
the managerial position is a woman who

4431
03:28:45,060 --> 03:28:46,680
take advantage of it claimed because it continues

4432
03:28:46,680 --> 03:28:48,300
having very few women in positions

4433
03:28:48,300 --> 03:28:50,489
managers when many deserve to be

4434
03:28:50,489 --> 03:28:52,250
there

4435
03:28:52,250 --> 03:28:56,180
in the end they also end up trusting because

4436
03:28:56,180 --> 03:28:58,610
how is a woman going to uncover me

4437
03:28:58,610 --> 03:29:00,811
person my own gender

4438
03:29:00,811 --> 03:29:03,631
that is to say the man how he is going to deceive me

4439
03:29:03,631 --> 03:29:06,541
a woman without candy and is feminine and the

4440
03:29:06,541 --> 03:29:09,891
A woman, how is she not going to cheat on another woman?

4441
03:29:10,649 --> 03:29:13,529
we have another question than what books or

4442
03:29:13,529 --> 03:29:15,510
recommended information to learn

4443
03:29:15,510 --> 03:29:18,060
more about social engineering

4444
03:29:18,060 --> 03:29:20,970
well look I think I have here

4445
03:29:20,970 --> 03:29:24,079
scored one

4446
03:29:24,090 --> 03:29:27,120
I really like it was reading it

4447
03:29:27,120 --> 03:29:30,330
this summer is titled psychology

4448
03:29:30,330 --> 03:29:32,490
dark how to analyze people and

twitter for some questions I'm going to

4457
03:29:53,529 --> 03:29:56,199
give you one last question and we'll move on

4458
03:29:56,199 --> 03:29:59,369

well there is

4461

Well, several several questions, but how?

4462
03:30:10,300 --> 03:30:11,891
something that might catch your attention

4463
03:30:11,891 --> 03:30:14,410
these tools

4464
03:30:14,410 --> 03:30:18,030
you usually use in linux environments

4465
03:30:20,391 --> 03:30:24,730
Well, woman, there are many, but

4466
03:30:24,730 --> 03:30:30,131
pretty much linux a shot from here

4467
03:30:30,180 --> 03:30:32,090
Y

4468
03:30:32,090 --> 03:30:37,750
harvester should be and little else

4469
03:30:38,239 --> 03:30:41,749
the web tool that, after all,

4470
03:30:41,749 --> 03:30:44,149
does not force me to sit in front of the

4471
03:30:44,149 --> 03:30:45,979
computer I can perfectly pull

4472
03:30:45,979 --> 03:30:48,439
an old mobile that I have and this

4473
03:30:48,439 --> 03:30:50,299
activity on the couch or going out for a

4474
03:30:50,299 --> 03:30:52,939
I walk and say I'm going to look and take advantage

4475
03:30:52,939 --> 03:30:55,399
and I shoot from the mobile and that's it, then I shoot

4476
03:30:55,399 --> 03:30:58,669
quite a web tool yes in fact there is

4477
03:30:58,669 --> 03:31:02,119
very good web resources and it would be very

4478
03:31:02,119 --> 03:31:04,549
interesting if you can share

4479
03:31:04,549 --> 03:31:06,049

4482
03:31:11,149 --> 03:31:12,379
told to most people is that

4483
03:31:12,379 --> 03:31:15,439

pleasure to be here Venezuela always

4550
03:33:59,699 --> 03:34:01,979
I was very aware of the community in

4551
03:34:01,979 --> 03:34:04,710
this moment my partner that the one who goes

4552
03:34:04,710 --> 03:34:07,290
to start the talk as such they are already

4553
03:34:07,290 --> 03:34:09,870
connecting here we have been having

4554
03:34:09,870 --> 03:34:13,010
also some technical problems

4555
03:34:13,010 --> 03:34:15,120
connectivity but as we all know

4556
03:34:15,120 --> 03:34:17,699
when we are live they always happen

4557
03:34:17,699 --> 03:34:20,699
this type of situations good the day of

4558
03:34:20,699 --> 03:34:22,080
today we are going to be presenting something good

4559
03:34:22,080 --> 03:34:24,210
interesting is a good one actually

4560
03:34:24,210 --> 03:34:26,370
presented on the magical platform with

4561
03:34:26,370 --> 03:34:28,649
that of products and fiction in the

4562
03:34:28,649 --> 03:34:29,989
which will allow us

4563
03:34:29,989 --> 03:34:33,500
somehow

4564
03:34:33,720 --> 03:34:36,840
Let's see how we can violate security

4565
03:34:36,840 --> 03:34:41,250
of this platform and the entire set of

4566
03:34:41,250 --> 03:34:43,529
risks that are associated with

4567
03:34:43,529 --> 03:34:46,380
vulnerability I don't know if you wanted to give me

4568
03:34:46,380 --> 03:34:48,060
a few minutes while my partner

4569
03:34:48,060 --> 03:34:50,370
connect believe that it is going to start and that's it

4570
03:34:50,370 --> 03:34:54,239
must part the practical part of the

4571
03:34:54,239 --> 03:34:56,650
demonstration that we are going to do

4572
03:34:56,650 --> 03:35:01,250
It already tells me that it is already connecting in

4573
03:35:01,250 --> 03:35:03,950
the way then i have problems

4574
03:35:03,950 --> 03:35:07,280
jonathan me still cantons solving

4575
03:35:07,280 --> 03:35:09,640
some doubts from people

4576
03:35:09,640 --> 03:35:12,460
thank the

4577
03:35:12,460 --> 03:35:15,950
It is true that they have taken themselves very seriously.

4578
03:35:15,950 --> 03:35:17,420
what I told you at the beginning of the talk

4579
03:35:17,420 --> 03:35:21,561
the only way we have to show them

4580
03:35:21,561 --> 03:35:23,630
the affection to explain that they are

4581
03:35:23,630 --> 03:35:25,700
sharing your knowledge with everyone

4582
03:35:25,700 --> 03:35:27,980
us for free and without any

4583
03:35:27,980 --> 03:35:32,021
and if we say without saving anything

4584
03:35:32,021 --> 03:35:35,450
is thanking them for social networks to

4585
03:35:35,450 --> 03:35:38,180
stealing them in the different media that

4586
03:35:38,180 --> 03:35:40,220
have on hand sending them some

4587
03:35:40,220 --> 03:35:42,370
message why not demand

4588
03:35:42,370 --> 03:35:45,620
any direct by twitter I have

4589
03:35:45,620 --> 03:35:48,290
seen that many people have taken

4590
03:35:48,290 --> 03:35:50,720
seriously the meme contest and we

4591
03:35:50,720 --> 03:35:52,340
it pleases a lot and we are going to fulfill it

4592
03:35:52,340 --> 03:35:55,370
so it is always very good to see how

4593
03:35:55,370 --> 03:35:57,320
around an event like this

4594
03:35:57,320 --> 03:35:59,840
generates all those in all dynamics

4595
03:35:59,840 --> 03:36:02,870
to share the emotion that is felt

4596
03:36:02,870 --> 03:36:06,500
to be together around something that

4597
03:36:06,500 --> 03:36:09,290
catches our attention and that's what

4598
03:36:09,290 --> 03:36:10,820
we've been feeling for the past

4599
03:36:10,820 --> 03:36:13,280
years, that is why we have

4600
03:36:13,280 --> 03:36:15,080
decided that although next year

4601
03:36:15,080 --> 03:36:17,420
let's do face-to-face we are not going to leave a

4602
03:36:17,420 --> 03:36:19,311
next to the issue of streaming let's

4603
03:36:19,311 --> 03:36:22,880
try to make this last with him

4604
03:36:22,880 --> 03:36:25,311
time next year not our our

4605
03:36:25,311 --> 03:36:28,370
tenth edition and after it was already connected

4606
03:36:28,370 --> 03:36:30,950
but I want to end the message with a

4607
03:36:30,950 --> 03:36:33,021
huge thanks to all of you

4608
03:36:33,021 --> 03:36:35,570
who are attending the event and

4609
03:36:35,570 --> 03:36:37,490
who have shown us their love through networks

4610
03:36:37,490 --> 03:36:39,800
and for everything they are doing

4611
03:36:39,800 --> 03:36:42,439
with us then without further ado

4612
03:36:42,439 --> 03:36:44,319

humanity the nations that in their eagerness

4699

pioneers before other countries in areas

4704
03:40:59,300 --> 03:41:02,920
how the space race could military

4705
03:41:02,920 --> 03:41:05,630
technological infrastructures

4706
03:41:05,630 --> 03:41:07,910
sports cyberspace and also

4707
03:41:07,910 --> 03:41:11,480
we could talk about now the new

4708
03:41:11,480 --> 03:41:14,300
race by which the

4709
03:41:14,300 --> 03:41:15,920
great powers such as the

4710
03:41:15,920 --> 03:41:17,771
supremacy by quantum computing

4711
03:41:17,771 --> 03:41:20,840
but today we are going to talk about what

4712
03:41:20,840 --> 03:41:23,300
related to supremacy by

4713
03:41:23,300 --> 03:41:26,390
mass surveillance will be that already was

03:41:26,390 --> 03:41:28,340
accomplished well we are going to find out

4715
03:41:28,340 --> 03:41:30,940
in this talk

4716
03:41:30,940 --> 03:41:33,590
when we refer it

4717
03:41:33,590 --> 03:41:36,050
to mass surveillance not only

4718
03:41:36,050 --> 03:41:37,430
we refer to the countries that have

4719
03:41:37,430 --> 03:41:40,700
deployed thousands of cameras for the purposes of

4720
03:41:40,700 --> 03:41:42,770
national security and the prevention of

4721
03:41:42,770 --> 03:41:44,990
crime we are also referring to

4722
03:41:44,990 --> 03:41:47,359
countries that have programs in place

4723
03:41:47,359 --> 03:41:49,100
surveillance secrets for the purpose of

4724
03:41:49,100 --> 03:41:51,040
worldwide espionage

4725
03:41:51,040 --> 03:41:54,649
under this premise and without going into details

4726
03:41:54,649 --> 03:41:57,979
conspiratorial politicians paranoia or

4727
03:41:57,979 --> 03:42:01,100
discredit a common brand but

4728
03:42:01,100 --> 03:42:03,020
Let's focus on what are the

4729
03:42:03,020 --> 03:42:05,780
facts made in the public domain that

4730
03:42:05,780 --> 03:42:08,630
you are already aware and that you are not

4731
03:42:08,630 --> 03:42:11,830
not at all confidential we will pass

4732
03:42:11,830 --> 03:42:14,830
then

4733
03:42:15,189 --> 03:42:18,699
to the gift of decoration in the look of the

4734
03:42:18,699 --> 03:42:22,539

4735
03:42:22,539 --> 03:42:25,569
number one manufacturer in sales worldwide

4736
03:42:25,569 --> 03:42:27,159

4737
03:42:27,159 --> 03:42:31,989
as is the chinese manufacturer hi vision

4738
03:42:31,989 --> 03:42:36,359
in the year 2017 gentlemen

4739
03:42:36,359 --> 03:42:39,419
the emergency response team

4740
03:42:39,419 --> 03:42:41,430
cyber control system

4741
03:42:41,430 --> 03:42:42,959

4742
03:42:42,959 --> 03:42:46,289
United States national issued a

4743
03:42:46,289 --> 03:42:47,539
warning

4744
03:42:47,539 --> 03:42:50,100
confirming the work of a

4745
03:42:50,100 --> 03:42:51,260
investigator

4746
03:42:51,260 --> 03:42:54,449
which had revealed that in the products

4747
03:42:54,449 --> 03:42:57,539
of the brand were doors

4748
03:42:57,539 --> 03:43:01,260
hidden rear ok and this is good yes

4749
03:43:01,260 --> 03:43:05,939
it certainly caused quite a stir

4750
03:43:05,939 --> 03:43:09,209
within the international community is

4751
03:43:09,209 --> 03:43:14,249
just as some have already come to light

4752
03:43:14,249 --> 03:43:15,529
signs

4753
03:43:15,529 --> 03:43:17,550
highlighted by the government

4754
03:43:17,550 --> 03:43:19,739
American such as having

4755
03:43:19,739 --> 03:43:24,449
inserted a backdoor or factor and

4756
03:43:24,449 --> 03:43:28,949
supporting the chinese communist party pcc

4757
03:43:28,949 --> 03:43:31,649
and abuses within the country and the use of its

4758
03:43:31,649 --> 03:43:32,789
surveillance technology

4759
03:43:32,789 --> 03:43:35,909
global and espionage towards the

4760
03:43:35,909 --> 03:43:37,620
governments

4761
03:43:37,620 --> 03:43:42,210
well on the other hand and that's how it was in the

4762
03:43:42,210 --> 03:43:47,970
year 2019 this transcended to the point

4763
03:43:47,970 --> 03:43:51,350
about what

4764
03:43:51,910 --> 03:43:56,920
and vision in this was included within

4765
03:43:56,920 --> 03:44:00,130
economic blacklist because of how

4766
03:44:00,130 --> 03:44:03,420

relevant news that put into

4768
03:44:06,750 --> 03:44:09,210
question the safety of their

4769
03:44:09,210 --> 03:44:12,900
products we see then that this brand

4770
03:44:12,900 --> 03:44:15,150
was considered a threat to the

4771
03:44:15,150 --> 03:44:17,340
national security and for and for the

4772
03:44:17,340 --> 03:44:20,420
government communication networks

4773
03:44:20,420 --> 03:44:24,899
American even in the year 2020

4774
03:44:24,899 --> 03:44:27,689
the American government allocated to all

4775
03:44:27,689 --> 03:44:29,579
these companies that had stock

4776
03:44:29,579 --> 03:44:31,340
commodity

4777
03:44:31,340 --> 03:44:34,890

03:44:34,890 --> 03:44:36,510
million dollars to finance

4779
03:44:36,510 --> 03:44:37,979
all those companies that want

4780
03:44:37,979 --> 03:44:40,010
replace even

4781
03:44:40,010 --> 03:44:43,649
equipment already equipment infrastructure

4782
03:44:43,649 --> 03:44:46,369
or systems that had been acquired

4783
03:44:46,369 --> 03:44:49,919
for security purposes with the use of

4784
03:44:49,919 --> 03:44:51,359
this trade mark

4785
03:44:51,359 --> 03:44:54,739
licenses were also revoked

4786
03:44:54,739 --> 03:44:57,779
very important credibility within the

4787
03:44:57,779 --> 03:45:00,029
security industry in March

4788
03:45:00,029 --> 03:45:02,909
2021 the federal commission of

4789
03:45:02,909 --> 03:45:06,169
communications an independent body

4790
03:45:06,169 --> 03:45:11,310
good american congress

4791
03:45:11,310 --> 03:45:13,800
issued a request to ban

4792
03:45:13,800 --> 03:45:16,459
companies such as division and others

4793
03:45:16,459 --> 03:45:18,869
marketing of products in

4794
03:45:18,869 --> 03:45:22,319
american territory well this has been

4795
03:45:22,319 --> 03:45:25,199
just some of the news from you

4796
03:45:25,199 --> 03:45:26,779
has been wrapped

4797
03:45:26,779 --> 03:45:31,459
this interesting brand

4798
03:45:33,140 --> 03:45:35,620
by then

4799
03:45:35,620 --> 03:45:39,290
ending the pandemic the president i

4800
03:45:39,290 --> 03:45:41,649
me and jayden

4801
03:45:41,649 --> 03:45:45,680
following the work that he was doing

4802
03:45:45,680 --> 03:45:49,729
your former predecessor donald trump good

4803
03:45:49,729 --> 03:45:52,760
They already put an official news and that

4804
03:45:52,760 --> 03:45:56,659
generated international impact iis and good

4805
03:45:56,659 --> 03:46:00,380
this these two brands that we are

4806
03:46:00,380 --> 03:46:03,050
talking mainly I don't know anymore

4807
03:46:03,050 --> 03:46:05,840
can trade within within no

4808
03:46:05,840 --> 03:46:07,370
only within the American territory

4809
03:46:07,370 --> 03:46:10,310
but also within other countries is

4810
03:46:10,310 --> 03:46:13,399
so gentlemen as demonstrated

4811
03:46:13,399 --> 03:46:15,140
suspicions that were had that already china

4812
03:46:15,140 --> 03:46:17,060
had achieved supremacy

4813
03:46:17,060 --> 03:46:19,189
mass surveillance and espionage

4814
03:46:19,189 --> 03:46:22,310
global scale so much so that all

4815
03:46:22,310 --> 03:46:24,859
American embassies in all

4816
03:46:24,859 --> 03:46:28,010
countries were removed and destroyed

4817
03:46:28,010 --> 03:46:29,960
all kinds of related equipment

4818
03:46:29,960 --> 03:46:32,390
these marks as well as within the

4819
03:46:32,390 --> 03:46:34,870
body level

4820
03:46:34,870 --> 03:46:40,189
national of this country well some

4821
03:46:40,189 --> 03:46:43,010
they believe that the American government is

4822
03:46:43,010 --> 03:46:46,279
You are doing this for information purposes only.

4823
03:46:46,279 --> 03:46:49,310
discredit these Chinese companies and

4824
03:46:49,310 --> 03:46:52,939
even the affected brands have issued

4825
03:46:52,939 --> 03:46:54,649
their communications

4826
03:46:54,649 --> 03:46:57,740
mentioning which states they have been

4827
03:46:57,740 --> 03:47:00,000
wrong and unfair

4828
03:47:00,000 --> 03:47:02,790
and what do you think it will be that you are

4829
03:47:02,790 --> 03:47:05,220
exaggerating well let's see it

4830
03:47:05,220 --> 03:47:08,040
then there is an organization that

4831
03:47:08,040 --> 03:47:13,140
call and pn and they take care of

4832
03:47:13,140 --> 03:47:17,100
divert a lot of marks

4833
03:47:17,100 --> 03:47:21,050
related to video security

4834
03:47:21,050 --> 03:47:26,550
worldwide they have even been

4835
03:47:26,550 --> 03:47:32,159
one of the pioneers in mentioning

4836
03:47:32,159 --> 03:47:35,460
everything related to the brand

4837
03:47:35,460 --> 03:47:39,210
hi vision have even developed a

4838
03:47:39,210 --> 03:47:42,140
online map where you can see

4839
03:47:42,140 --> 03:47:46,500
How do you see this search engine below?

4840
03:47:46,500 --> 03:47:49,920
is exclusive where the

4841
03:47:49,920 --> 03:47:51,689
number of thousands of devices

4842
03:47:51,689 --> 03:47:54,330
millions of devices that are

4843
03:47:54,330 --> 03:47:56,739
exposed not only

4844
03:47:56,739 --> 03:48:00,970
in the usa but also in europe this for

4845
03:48:00,970 --> 03:48:03,329
just quote something

4846
03:48:03,329 --> 03:48:08,169
only a few regions as such out of thousands

4847
03:48:08,169 --> 03:48:11,140
of billions of devices that

4848
03:48:11,140 --> 03:48:15,100
are connected in the cloud

4849
03:48:15,100 --> 03:48:19,860
well there are others

4850
03:48:19,860 --> 03:48:24,660
real-time captures of good and for

4851
03:48:24,660 --> 03:48:27,170
keep adding more to the cake

4852
03:48:27,170 --> 03:48:30,150
exhibition have already cataloged him as an actor

4853
03:48:30,150 --> 03:48:32,221
hole in the abuse of rights

4854
03:48:32,221 --> 03:48:35,700
human division is then part of

4855
03:48:35,700 --> 03:48:38,551
a group of Chinese companies that

4856
03:48:38,551 --> 03:48:40,950
They were also placed inside the

4857
03:48:40,950 --> 03:48:42,870
blacklist but now from the department

4858
03:48:42,870 --> 03:48:44,931
usa trade

4859
03:48:44,931 --> 03:48:48,391
for the support with the use of their

4860
03:48:48,391 --> 03:48:51,150
technologies or sophisticated

4861
03:48:51,150 --> 03:48:56,341
for abuses of citizens in the region of

4862
03:48:56,341 --> 03:48:57,440
xinjiang

4863
03:48:57,440 --> 03:49:01,521
that include torture, sterilization

4864
03:49:01,521 --> 03:49:04,101
political indoctrination and jobs

4865
03:49:04,101 --> 03:49:07,101
forced

4866
03:49:07,290 --> 03:49:10,021
and this has also been echoed in countries

4867
03:49:10,021 --> 03:49:12,420
like canada the netherlands the kingdom

4868
03:49:12,420 --> 03:49:16,190
united and the and of the american government

4869
03:49:16,190 --> 03:49:18,841
good but we still have much more

4870
03:49:18,841 --> 03:49:21,271
discovery truth and that's what

4871
03:49:21,271 --> 03:49:23,431
today we are going to present

4872
03:49:23,431 --> 03:49:27,450
of the actor is a security breach that

4873
03:49:27,450 --> 03:49:32,271
we could find on the servers

4874
03:49:32,380 --> 03:49:35,891
where all these connect

4875
03:49:35,891 --> 03:49:40,880
devices on a global scale and that today

4876
03:49:40,880 --> 03:49:44,181
going today we are going to analyze what are the

4877
03:49:44,181 --> 03:49:48,261
risks and implied threats

4878
03:49:48,261 --> 03:49:51,921
well, some will say that it's all good

4879
03:49:51,921 --> 03:49:55,371
what is it worth is that they are looking at me in

4880
03:49:55,371 --> 03:49:57,741
the cameras that may not affect me

4881
03:49:57,741 --> 03:50:01,761
not at all but certainly maybe for

4882
03:50:01,761 --> 03:50:04,641
you are not

4883
03:50:04,641 --> 03:50:07,671
I do not represent it but if we have already seen

4884
03:50:07,671 --> 03:50:10,570
what like

4885
03:50:10,570 --> 03:50:14,141
you are not only this brand but also

4886
03:50:14,141 --> 03:50:17,590
many others are having incidents

4887
03:50:17,590 --> 03:50:20,530
not that they are bringing with them a great

4888
03:50:20,530 --> 03:50:21,780
possibility

4889
03:50:21,780 --> 03:50:25,271
a wide range of diverse

4890
03:50:25,271 --> 03:50:28,150
crimes that can be committed as harassment

4891
03:50:28,150 --> 03:50:30,641
extortion espionage and damage to the

4892
03:50:30,641 --> 03:50:31,650
reputation

4893
03:50:31,650 --> 03:50:35,021
this we mention is because

4894
03:50:35,021 --> 03:50:38,221
over time

4895
03:50:38,221 --> 03:50:40,931
as we have dedicated ourselves to

4896
03:50:40,931 --> 03:50:43,750
document all techniques and methods

4897
03:50:43,750 --> 03:50:48,521
is related to the sabotage to the

4898
03:50:48,521 --> 03:50:50,320
good video surveillance systems

4899
03:50:50,320 --> 03:50:52,931
you will see below how

4900
03:50:52,931 --> 03:50:55,271
We have grouped them by techniques by

4901
03:50:55,271 --> 03:50:58,750
levels where well maybe some

4902
03:50:58,750 --> 03:51:01,240
of you already know them but you will see

4903
03:51:01,240 --> 03:51:04,320
other techniques that are a bit

4904
03:51:04,320 --> 03:51:07,931
unknown to some let's start with

4905
03:51:07,931 --> 03:51:10,150
the techniques of level 1 good those

4906
03:51:10,150 --> 03:51:12,221
They are also known as sabotage

4907
03:51:12,221 --> 03:51:13,630
the physical and are all those that

4908
03:51:13,630 --> 03:51:16,479
seek to achieve hardware damage or

4909
03:51:16,479 --> 03:51:20,160
components some of them are

4910
03:51:20,160 --> 03:51:23,880
the disable power reset by

4911
03:51:23,880 --> 03:51:26,641
click video disconnections rifles

4912
03:51:26,641 --> 03:51:29,061
paint clogging with balloons

4913
03:51:29,061 --> 03:51:32,460
inhibition with laser pointers inhibition

4914
03:51:32,460 --> 03:51:35,760
rf and also inductive course these are

4915
03:51:35,760 --> 03:51:37,610
primer techniques

4916
03:51:37,610 --> 03:51:40,470
level that are extremely simple

4917
03:51:40,470 --> 03:51:43,800
but we are going to advance to the techniques

4918
03:51:43,800 --> 03:51:46,490
level 2 well they already have

4919
03:51:46,490 --> 03:51:53,610
in order to achieve access and

4920
03:51:53,610 --> 03:51:56,490
we see there some like for example

4921
03:51:56,490 --> 03:51:58,740
passwords for exploitation defects

4922
03:51:58,740 --> 03:52:00,091
from service

4923
03:52:00,091 --> 03:52:04,200
some web server hacking candy

4924
03:52:04,200 --> 03:52:06,710
that we already saw in

4925
03:52:06,710 --> 03:52:09,841
that positive a few moments ago and

4926
03:52:09,841 --> 03:52:12,950
some vulnerabilities should be

4927
03:52:12,950 --> 03:52:16,200
in the case of level 3 techniques

4928
03:52:16,200 --> 03:52:18,181
well, they are those who seek the

4929
03:52:18,181 --> 03:52:19,860
forgery and impersonation

4930
03:52:19,860 --> 03:52:22,561
images and this type of technique is a

4931
03:52:22,561 --> 03:52:25,320
little more sophisticated and we find

4932
03:52:25,320 --> 03:52:29,070
dns spoofing and spoofing

4933
03:52:29,070 --> 03:52:31,980
streaming in the case of techniques

4934
03:52:31,980 --> 03:52:34,650
of level 4 these more oriented parties

4935
03:52:34,650 --> 03:52:37,021
to nullification and destruction

4936
03:52:37,021 --> 03:52:40,141
of devices we see attacks from

4937
03:52:40,141 --> 03:52:43,710
denial of service update

4938
03:52:43,710 --> 03:52:46,239
firmware with

4939
03:52:46,239 --> 03:52:51,339
the purpose of making useless

4940
03:52:51,339 --> 03:52:52,709
the devices

4941
03:52:52,709 --> 03:52:57,339
we have now included a new technique and

4942
03:52:57,339 --> 03:52:59,739
are the level 5 techniques that are the

4943
03:52:59,739 --> 03:53:01,209
that today we are going to present with the

4944
03:53:01,209 --> 03:53:05,049
tool and informer and is based on

4945
03:53:05,049 --> 03:53:06,669
extraction of sensitive data from

4946
03:53:06,669 --> 03:53:09,250
manufacturer cloud servers

4947
03:53:09,250 --> 03:53:10,740
[Music]

4948
03:53:10,740 --> 03:53:13,200
very good good up to here then we have

4949
03:53:13,200 --> 03:53:18,300
that we already saw the context for

4950
03:53:18,300 --> 03:53:23,130
where does this tool come from

4951
03:53:23,130 --> 03:53:25,141
investigation that today we are

4952
03:53:25,141 --> 03:53:28,920
presenting and well here you can see

4953
03:53:28,920 --> 03:53:33,240
on the screen that if it betrays what

4954
03:53:33,240 --> 03:53:37,771
does to is connect to the cloud

4955
03:53:37,771 --> 03:53:39,891
youtube service

4956
03:53:39,891 --> 03:53:42,891
where are they

4957
03:53:42,891 --> 03:53:45,630
registered all billions

4958
03:53:45,630 --> 03:53:47,450
of devices

4959
03:53:47,450 --> 03:53:52,650
here also they not only make life to them

4960
03:53:52,650 --> 03:53:56,521
but also dating people

4961
03:53:56,521 --> 03:53:59,820
individuals companies and users

4962
03:53:59,820 --> 03:54:03,811
late hit telltale what it does is a

4963
03:54:03,811 --> 03:54:08,420
search and collection and already using

4964
03:54:08,470 --> 03:54:10,960
dictionary attacks lists

4965
03:54:10,960 --> 03:54:13,000
emails or emails

4966
03:54:13,000 --> 03:54:15,239
specific in

4967
03:54:15,239 --> 03:54:18,100
for example of specific companies that

4968
03:54:18,100 --> 03:54:19,840
they can

4969
03:54:19,840 --> 03:54:23,670
have registered some some

4970
03:54:23,670 --> 03:54:27,620
devices on the platform

4971
03:54:27,620 --> 03:54:30,220
But in fact

4972
03:54:30,220 --> 03:54:33,550
we can take him out

4973
03:54:33,550 --> 03:54:36,710
many more potential threats such as

4974
03:54:36,710 --> 03:54:39,670
example to know email accounts

4975
03:54:39,670 --> 03:54:42,210
Already

4976
03:54:42,210 --> 03:54:45,100
registered belonging devices

4977
03:54:45,100 --> 03:54:48,910
to other regions sending applications

4978
03:54:48,910 --> 03:54:51,820
mass to add another device the

4979
03:54:51,820 --> 03:54:53,980
forged emails with

4980
03:54:53,980 --> 03:54:57,700
intent to reset passwords

4981
03:54:57,700 --> 03:54:59,980
send transmission requests no

4982
03:54:59,980 --> 03:55:02,021
desired extortion for the

4983
03:55:02,021 --> 03:55:03,580
recovery of accounts that were

4984
03:55:03,580 --> 03:55:06,880
kidnapped the detention of the

4985
03:55:06,880 --> 03:55:08,980
operations of companies that provide this

4986
03:55:08,980 --> 03:55:11,860
type of service selling in forums

4987
03:55:11,860 --> 03:55:14,000
mailing lists

4988
03:55:14,000 --> 03:55:16,460
and accesses obtained from the transmission of

4989
03:55:16,460 --> 03:55:20,350
pornographic content and others such as

4990
03:55:20,350 --> 03:55:23,300
network identification and escalation

4991
03:55:23,300 --> 03:55:25,520
personal and corporate good are you

4992
03:55:25,520 --> 03:55:28,640
are all potential threats in

4993
03:55:28,640 --> 03:55:31,359
that we could

4994
03:55:32,540 --> 03:55:36,080
be ok with what can be done with

4995
03:55:36,080 --> 03:55:39,470
this tool and with an extension of

4996
03:55:39,470 --> 03:55:40,800
she

4997
03:55:40,800 --> 03:55:44,790
but let's see a demonstration

4998
