dragon event sponsor

111
00:16:19,339 --> 00:16:22,560
Well, basically the expectation has been

112
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:25,199
great really was what I

113
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:27,720
I expected as always in all

114
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:31,199
events and then the truth has always

115
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:33,959
been a Colombian showcase for the

116
00:16:33,959 --> 00:16:35,940
talented people in safety

117
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:38,579
computer science both in Latin America and

118
00:16:38,579 --> 00:16:42,779
locals and for my part I invite you to

119
00:16:42,779 --> 00:16:45,600
an approximate and it is a pleasure to be

120
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,519
Sharing with all of you how are you

121
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:49,880
How are you? I'm Pablo Quiñez from Peru

122
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:52,040
good i am

123
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:54,839
someone very involved in this topic a long time ago

124
00:16:54,839 --> 00:16:57,300
time the truth did not come to manizales

125
00:16:57,300 --> 00:17:00,079
Many years ago

126
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:05,819
25 later in 2009 and ago and I think

127
00:17:05,819 --> 00:17:07,859
that time did not come manizales has grown

128
00:17:07,859 --> 00:17:11,540
a lot of La Movida de seguridad too

129
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:14,760
the event has grown the same

130
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:16,199
University in fact there is not yet

131
00:17:16,199 --> 00:17:17,480
that they did not know

132
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:20,160
I am very happy because it feels like

133
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:23,059
there is let's say more participation

134
00:17:23,059 --> 00:17:25,260
The important thing is to generate more

135
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:27,980
awareness more awareness as to

136
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:31,250
to make sure or to be insecure

137
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:32,940
[Music]

138
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:35,520
good morning afternoon or evening

139
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,679
Depending on the time of the place where

140
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:40,200
are watching this event My name is

141
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,700
Jaime Restrepo and I'm going to do this

142
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:43,559
constitute on the last day of congress

143
00:17:43,559 --> 00:17:47,280
Jacques Dragon hacks today is

144
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:49,980
a very special day because we have like

145
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:52,380
all the last two days Very good

146
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:55,740
content but because it is also the

147
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:57,240
last day of our event So

148
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:59,760
that is the day where we need more

149
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,440
energy from you where we need it

150
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:04,200
be more active and active where they

151
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:06,480
We are going to announce how they are going to generate their

152
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,700
certificate of attendance and others

153
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:11,700
more surprises then don't stop being

154
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:13,620
active drink your coffee I have the

155
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:16,159
mine here for example

156
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:20,340
Colombian coffee of the Good then

157
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:23,340
we continue

158
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:26,640
Remember that as we are transmitting

159
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:29,160
through multiple channels simultaneously

160
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:30,660
questions will be on a site

161
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:33,000
centralized this centralized site is

162
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:37,200
calls leave point is the questions and what

163
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,240
you can create in that QR code always

164
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:40,860
Ask a question if it doesn't come out

165
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:42,600
there it will not appear on the screen then

166
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:45,419
Remember that it is good that when you are

167
00:18:45,419 --> 00:18:47,100
the question occurs, ask it at once

168
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:50,880
for when there are no questions

169
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:53,340
delay that we have more or less than one or

170
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:54,900
two minutes while the news arrives

171
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:56,340
to you and while the

172
00:18:56,340 --> 00:18:57,960
transmission

173
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:00,360
and you need a bidirectional channel

174
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:02,520
we want different spaces in

175
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:04,500
the community many social networks All

176
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:08,580
are identified in this URL but Les

00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:10,500
I recommend then that you follow the account

178
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:13,380
in Telegram and the account on disk yes

179
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:16,140
they want a communication channel

180
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:19,500
let's say more active true

181
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:22,500
the ctf does not end today with the event but

182
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:24,360
which runs until Sunday at

183
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:26,480
12 at night so if they haven't

184
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:29,580
carried out the activities of the cts

185
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:30,720
I recommend that you can do them

186
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,539
why

187
00:19:32,539 --> 00:19:35,880
because it is a challenge that has different

188
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:37,679
levels of complexity everyone can

189
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:39,720
participate and the truth is that people

190
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:42,059
of Hard Rock is a very very job

191
00:19:42,059 --> 00:19:43,740
well

192
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:46,020
It will be the top that they gave us in their

193
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:48,559
moment surely these movements

194
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:52,080
Well let's say This is this ranking already

195
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:54,860
has had any movement

196
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:57,780
And what was the certificate, well, how do you

197
00:19:57,780 --> 00:19:59,520
we promised today they will have it

198
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:03,900
true at this URL at this QR code

199
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:05,880
you will be able to see a video where

200
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:08,520
We explain step by step how to

201
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:10,320
generating the certificate is basically

202
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:13,260
access the page Dragon hardcore.org

203
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:16,919
go to the file tab and once

204
00:20:16,919 --> 00:20:20,360
in the file tab, they are going to go and

205
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:24,059
They are going to identify Well, the country, the country

206
00:20:24,059 --> 00:20:27,720
not the year sorry the year of the event

207
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:29,640
we already that is our ninth of

208
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:31,320
the next edition will be the tenth

209
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:34,620
editing that sounds sounds very nice to say

210
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:39,140
10 years doing this for the community

211
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:41,840
posting quality content

212
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,620
computer security related

213
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:46,620
So they go in there to see some

214
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:48,720
classes classes are actually all

215
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:51,299
the talks of that year's event are going to

216
00:20:51,299 --> 00:20:53,760
to be able to mark that as seen

217
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,440
talks and once they finish all the

218
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:57,480
that will be able to generate your certificate

219
00:20:57,480 --> 00:21:01,640
digital attendance for this event

220
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:04,440
the purpose is that when the

221
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:06,660
late the memes that are seen on the screen

222
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:08,460
be something like that Not that everyone has

223
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:11,280
certificate And may all of you be

224
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:13,919
generating envy with his friends that

225
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:15,480
enjoy these three days of content

226
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:16,860
safety-related quality

227
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:21,059
computing and they don't

228
00:21:21,059 --> 00:21:23,520
This would not be possible without the support of

229
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:25,320
all of you, I repeat, you have

230
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:27,360
been an essential part for me to be

231
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:29,159
inside the affection can be carried out

232
00:21:29,159 --> 00:21:30,960
that the cuttings have expressed to them

233
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,299
affection that they have expressed to us

234
00:21:32,299 --> 00:21:34,919
the movement that has taken place in networks

235
00:21:34,919 --> 00:21:37,020
has been impressive the first

236
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:39,240

239
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:46,200
the cities where we are broadcasting

240
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:48,539

that they have on the diploma or on

319

opportunity to talk about this topic

323
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:04,380
true we have a hacker world that in the

324
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:06,900
month of October they will have a

325
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:08,580
a conference but with a

326
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:10,799
very different particularity will not

327
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:12,720
be talks in which only

328
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:15,240
explain separate art from a stage

329
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:17,820
and its content, but by making

330
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:20,280
workshops workshops where the

331
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:22,380
people where people not only see

332
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:24,960
but do then it will be enough

333
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:27,960
interesting this dynamic is called the

334
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:30,059
world hacker Academy that was going to be in the

335

manizales that has a specialization

340
00:25:41,159 --> 00:25:43,020
in computer security very interesting

341
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:45,380
if you are interested in training

342
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:48,360
let's say professional in the world of

343
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:50,880
informal anti-cair security in a way

344
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:52,320
through an academic entity

345
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:55,080
certified so they can use this

346
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:56,760
QR code to learn more about the program

347
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:59,460
from the Catholic University of Manizales

348
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:01,440
And that's all the thanks that

349
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:03,360
I have today without more

350
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:05,520
preambles let's talk a little with

351
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:08,039
Pedro candel Pedro candel is Spanish and

352
00:26:08,039 --> 00:26:10,200
He is going to talk a little bit about obfuscation

353
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:12,960
of code with different techniques Pedro

354
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:15,260
It's already on the screen Hi Pedro, what else?

355
00:26:15,260 --> 00:26:18,360
Hello how are you Jamie

356
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:20,159
Very well I'll leave you the public then

357
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:25,340
so that you illustrate us with your content

358
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:28,080
very well thank you very much Jaime and everyone

359
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:30,080
the team that you make possible

360
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:35,220
everything as usual One more year and without

361
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:37,460
more delay then let's

362
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:41,100
let's start let's start with what

363
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:43,020
what is the talk that is applying

364
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:46,500
math a 101 an intro for

365
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:49,500
to be able to evade or search many times Well

366
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:51,480
the code of Face to what would be the

367
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:54,360
part of the nrrs antivirus or the

368
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:55,679
concealment, for example, of the effects

369
00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:57,659
within what would be our code and

370
00:26:57,659 --> 00:27:00,120
avoid, for example, famous firms

371
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:03,080
detections we have

372
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:05,419
Introduce myself Although I've already done it

373
00:27:05,419 --> 00:27:08,279
My great friend Jaime is called Pedro

374
00:27:08,279 --> 00:27:10,980
candel know me as sauron i belong

375
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:12,679
So

376
00:27:12,679 --> 00:27:15,059
I dedicate myself since many years ago

377
00:27:15,059 --> 00:27:17,400
years to the issue of security and Well

378
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:19,559
Well, we play as I say all the

379
00:27:19,559 --> 00:27:22,080
chopsticks and put on top we have the Great

380
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:23,760
luckily they pay us for it with what

381
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:25,799
which we can not ask for more we have

382
00:27:25,799 --> 00:27:27,299
managed to make our hobby

383
00:27:27,299 --> 00:27:30,419
our profession animals to all

384
00:27:30,419 --> 00:27:32,640
participate in events to participate

385
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:34,440
in any type of conference

386
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:37,260
workshops as Jaime has well commented

387
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:39,179
for example world hacker academy that

388
00:27:39,179 --> 00:27:43,200
It will be next October 28 and without further ado

389
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,760
let's move on to what would be

390
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:47,400
frustration let's see one thing

391
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:50,279
I don't know if you've ever heard it

392
00:27:50,279 --> 00:27:52,140
talk about her but what would be the

393
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:55,679
arithmetic julian mixed expressions

394
00:27:55,679 --> 00:27:58,400
good for us first

395
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:01,320
let's let's talk about that idea

396
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:04,020
The main thing is to look for the code, we are going to

397
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:06,059
make a code foundation for

398
00:28:06,059 --> 00:28:08,520
transform an original program into

399
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:10,140
program let's call it PP that

400
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:11,820
we will use as input in another

401
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:13,860
equivalent to a prime prime where

402
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:16,919
functionally it will be equivalent without

403
00:28:16,919 --> 00:28:18,539
however logically through the

404
00:28:18,539 --> 00:28:20,220
frustration is going to be much more complex

405
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:22,919
to be able to be analyzed and that we can

406
00:28:22,919 --> 00:28:25,200
extract your information for example with

407
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:28,380
the well-known reversal techniques if

408
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:29,940
us for example in the program p

409
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:32,520
We have hidden some kind of Secret for

410
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:35,400
example constants we have used for

411
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:39,500
example that exist post we have used

412
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:41,760
certain little words that many times

413
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:44,400
antivirus RS already know Well then this

414
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:46,559
It is basic within the section of

415
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:48,320
reversion that is basic to be able to obtain it

416
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:50,820
through the process of concealment as

417
00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:52,799
well we have told them we are going to get a

418
00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:56,460
equivalent program but where I know a lot

419
00:28:56,460 --> 00:28:59,039
more complex to be able to analyze everything

420
00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:01,159
What would that information be and logically

421
00:29:01,159 --> 00:29:03,659
So it will continue to work the same.

422
00:29:03,659 --> 00:29:04,980
form

423
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:07,200
this will logically present

424
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:09,240
many use cases for example for

425
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:11,279
what would be the protection of the

426
00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:13,740
Software the subject for example of rights

427
00:29:13,740 --> 00:29:15,779
digital to be able to hide as

428
00:29:15,779 --> 00:29:17,700
recommended levels all theme of the

429
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:19,860
secrets to logically evade what

430
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:23,340
are the signature patterns of face by

431
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:26,419
example then to the famous relativity

432
00:29:26,419 --> 00:29:28,500
e.g. static stopping of

433
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:31,080
antivirus and will logically perform

434
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:34,500
Well, it's going to leave us at the point that

435
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:36,240
code analysis is going to get complicated

436
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:38,640
it will take a lot of effort

437
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:40,559
greatest greatest of time and

438
00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:43,020
logically it will translate into money

439
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:45,240
things that companies often

440
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:47,640
unfortunately they do not put or invest in

441
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:50,580
the necessary quantity the fucation is there

442
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:52,020
to say that it is completely different

443
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:54,620
different from what encryption would be

444
00:29:54,620 --> 00:29:57,360
all the techniques that we are going to

445
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:59,460
working here will allow us to obfuscate

446
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:01,919
the code but it will not be a method of the

447
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:03,840
encryption that is completely different

448
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:07,380
therefore there is always a teacher

449
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:10,320
reverse process the one we know as from

450
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:12,360
sofurcation that will allow to obtain

451
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:15,720
part or all of the original code

452
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:17,760
revealing all that would be the

453
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:19,559
rainbow secrets we have put

454
00:30:19,559 --> 00:30:21,779
within our code logically

455
00:30:21,779 --> 00:30:24,299
it will be much more complex but finally

456
00:30:24,299 --> 00:30:27,240
it will be possible then finally we will

457
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:29,340
make some conclusions where we will see

458
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:32,279
the complexity of using everything

459
00:30:32,279 --> 00:30:34,500
would be these types of expressions shortly

460
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:36,480
I'm going to introduce you

461
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:39,179
simply what is mba tension

462
00:30:39,179 --> 00:30:40,860
we are going to talk about them

463
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:44,659
a boolean mixed arithmetic expression

464
00:30:44,659 --> 00:30:47,220
we talked about it being an expression that

465
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:49,200
is made up of arithmetic operators

466
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:51,059
those we know in any kind of

467
00:30:51,059 --> 00:30:54,299
programming language like addition

468
00:30:54,299 --> 00:30:56,039
subtract multiplication division

469
00:30:56,039 --> 00:30:58,320
etcetera etcetera all operators

470
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:01,020
arithmetic and will also contain

471
00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:03,559
boolean operations at life level

472
00:31:03,559 --> 00:31:06,120
For example, the typical operations

473
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:09,020
how could he be

474
00:31:09,020 --> 00:31:13,380
for the Note ixor etcetera and they are going to us

475
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:16,080
allow formulating from what would be

476
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:19,320
that p I have looking to get that

477
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:20,640
Pepa

478
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:23,779
for example here we have an expression

479
00:31:23,779 --> 00:31:27,179
an mba where we could, well, we're going to

480
00:31:27,179 --> 00:31:30,120
denominate in and specifically because

481
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:32,159
we would be talking, for example, of a

482
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:35,179
expression of

483
00:31:35,299 --> 00:31:39,120
plus 2 over here we are observing what

484
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:42,360
are in this case arithmetic operators

485
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:46,580
and now again ix

486
00:31:46,580 --> 00:31:49,679
Well, here we have combined a

487
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:51,720
operator who is Nixon and here we have

488
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:53,760
combined another boolean operator that

489
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:55,260
would

490
00:31:55,260 --> 00:31:58,020
here we logically have what are the

491
00:31:58,020 --> 00:32:01,080
truth tables would see this and it has been

492
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:03,120
therefore widely studied within the

493
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:06,240
that would be the Angela with which well

494
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:08,399
we could use this kind of operator

495
00:32:08,399 --> 00:32:10,640
for example of

496
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:13,860
we could create complements rotation and

497
00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:15,899
is to the left to the right and

498
00:32:15,899 --> 00:32:18,000
all combinations of us

499
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,659
logically we would like

500
00:32:20,659 --> 00:32:24,179
combining this Well, we are going to

501
00:32:24,179 --> 00:32:26,820
see that the expressions that we are going to

502
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:29,640
be able to use every time will be a lot

503
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:31,640
more complete

504
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:34,380
I also want to present to you what

505
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:36,720
would be one of the people we have

506
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:39,840
here in Spain that is Halo Gamers the

507
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:42,659
In addition to devoting himself to the world of

508
00:32:42,659 --> 00:32:44,700
security is mathematical And well then

509
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:47,039
here you can find very

510
00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:49,919
very interesting and always logically

511
00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:52,440
I name because I have researched a lot

512
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:54,360
developed an end-of-year job

513
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:55,460
grade

514
00:32:55,460 --> 00:32:58,980
has developed a lot of information about

515
00:32:58,980 --> 00:33:02,100
of the mbas and of the opaque constants and

516
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:05,700
its disclosure therefore Here I leave

517
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:07,919
what would be your repository for that

518
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:10,559
can access and well, basically

519
00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:12,960
let's say introduced what would be then

520
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:16,679
that pressure of the mbas you are

521
00:33:16,679 --> 00:33:19,740
expressions and we could summarize it

522
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:22,919
just like this logically

523
00:33:22,919 --> 00:33:25,159
we are first thing in the morning

524
00:33:25,159 --> 00:33:28,919
per hour from Colombia here for example in

525
00:33:28,919 --> 00:33:31,140
Spain, well, you can eat it and well

526
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:33,480
Well, we don't want to break the

527
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:35,880
head from the beginning I do not want

528
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:38,640
go into great detail about what the

529
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:40,260
part of mathematics but we have something

530
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:42,840
what to play let's start to simplify

531
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:46,260
a little this so let's say sometimes that

532
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:48,840
seems complex let's simplify by

533
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:53,700
we are going to start from the example of what

534
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:56,159
simpler an expression let's

535
00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:59,039
call it an expression first starting

536
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:03,120
of what would be the base one more x and this

537
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:07,500
here for example if x is worth 2 and y is worth 3

538
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:11,219
since X + Y the result will be 5 and

539
00:34:11,219 --> 00:34:15,119
logically we all know how to do this

540
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:19,199
arithmetic expression to add 2 + 3 that

541
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:21,899
returns 5 however we

542
00:34:21,899 --> 00:34:24,060
we could use another blast

543
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:27,899
boolean a mba where we are going to combine

544
00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:30,359
as we have already introduced

545
00:34:30,359 --> 00:34:34,980
operators of this type that are here

546
00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:38,280
in this case the boolean AND operators

547
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:40,560
in this case the arithmetic operators

548
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:43,440
to do exactly the same

549
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:45,000
operation

550
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,418
that is to say this operation we

551
00:34:47,418 --> 00:34:50,639
we would talk about its result going to

552
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:54,359
return given X and Y with two and with three

553
00:34:54,359 --> 00:34:57,540
would return 5 but we could also

554
00:34:57,540 --> 00:34:59,880
play with what would be an expression

555
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:03,240
polynomial of the type pues as the

556
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:08,180
expression 3 then for example 151 by

557
00:35:08,180 --> 00:35:10,220
we would open this

558
00:35:10,220 --> 00:35:13,640
all these terms 39 etc etc

559
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:16,500
logically complicating something wrong what

560
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:19,099
it would be for the reversible part

561
00:35:19,099 --> 00:35:23,400
in this case the third session given the

562
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:26,220
same values ​​will be equivalent to the

563
00:35:26,220 --> 00:35:28,800
first to the second and will return

564
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:31,320
logically the same result

565
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:34,200
it would be obvious in a reversible to see a

566
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:36,119
expression a first of the expressions

567
00:35:36,119 --> 00:35:38,579
like two plus three but nevertheless yes

568
00:35:38,579 --> 00:35:40,380
we will transform this into code

569
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:43,680
Well, it would complicate that it would be a little

570
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:46,260
more complex therefore we will be able

571
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:49,560
always affirm these two premises

572
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:52,200
first is that its syntactic complexity

573
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:54,780
it will be different in some cases it will be

574
00:35:54,780 --> 00:35:57,900
obvious and in other cases it will logically be

575
00:35:57,900 --> 00:36:00,300
much more complex but semantically

576
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:03,000
they will always be equivalent let's

577
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,880
get the same result and logically

578
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:07,740
as we are talking a little about

579
00:36:07,740 --> 00:36:10,320
mathematics because we can prove it and

580
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:12,900
We must prove it with what it should

581
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:15,599
to be always the same to use inside

582
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:18,000
from the codes comes an expression or

583
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,460
Well another one depending on what we

584
00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:24,260
we want Well then we

585
00:36:24,260 --> 00:36:27,140
we could to demonstrate the complexity

586
00:36:27,140 --> 00:36:29,880
syntactically we could generate Well a

587
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:32,060
very simple code a code

588
00:36:32,060 --> 00:36:35,099
where we would express for example here in

589
00:36:35,099 --> 00:36:36,599
this case for the first of the

590
00:36:36,599 --> 00:36:39,200
extensions Well, if we pass a function

591
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:42,240
a first expression e1 where

592
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:45,800
Well, we pass a first parameter

593
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:48,119
another second parameter and where

594
00:36:48,119 --> 00:36:52,220
we would return the result of x + y

595
00:36:52,220 --> 00:36:55,320
logically in reverse without us

596
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:58,560
this would be obvious and we would see depending

597
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:01,320
also of whom, in this case, of

598
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:03,060
bagger that we are using then

599
00:37:03,060 --> 00:37:06,660
we would see something approximate like this one

600
00:37:06,660 --> 00:37:08,579
next expression where we go

601
00:37:08,579 --> 00:37:10,859
to play now with what would be the

602
00:37:10,859 --> 00:37:13,500
both arithmetic and

603
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:16,020
booleans as you can see here in

604
00:37:16,020 --> 00:37:19,200
these and would complicate something more what

605
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:20,880
would be the expression is no longer so

606
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:23,880
extremely immediate to see how the

607
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:25,920
result we find here and a

608
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:28,560
third expression where we would complete

609
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:31,619
a little more we can play with that

610
00:37:31,619 --> 00:37:33,380
third expression and

611
00:37:33,380 --> 00:37:37,619
we would complicate something more to say then

612
00:37:37,619 --> 00:37:41,820
let's prove it let's see if this

613
00:37:41,820 --> 00:37:45,060
is correct and we have prepared here in

614
00:37:45,060 --> 00:37:46,500
this case

615
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:49,099
Well, a first

616
00:37:49,099 --> 00:37:52,440
demonstration so you can see it

617
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:55,619
and we are simply going to play with it

618
00:37:55,619 --> 00:37:57,720
which would be in this case since values ​​of

619
00:37:57,720 --> 00:38:01,020
32 of 32-bit values ​​whereupon

620
00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:05,280
can we declare an integer worth 8

621
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:09,660
bits ok sign ok where do we pass this

622
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:11,160
expression with these two parameters

623
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:14,520
also 8 bits each and where

624
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:16,560
we return over like this that second

625
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:19,859
expression already using this type of

626
00:38:19,859 --> 00:38:23,099
Boolean operators And these operators

627
00:38:23,099 --> 00:38:26,220
here in this case well arithmetic is

628
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:28,640
third expression where are we going

629
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:31,880
mixing a little more and where

630
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:33,800
we would pick up here in this case

631
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:37,520
we would pick from the command line

632
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:39,839
a first argument a second argument

633
00:38:39,839 --> 00:38:41,520
that would be the ones that we would pass as

634
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:44,640
variables and logically if everything were

635
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:46,740
OK, so let's call the

636
00:38:46,740 --> 00:38:49,440
first to the second and to the third of

637
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:51,000
the

638
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:54,000
seen the code simply we

639
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,500
all we have to do is

640
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:58,500
compile it

641
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:01,920
We would have compiled it and now

642
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:04,260
we should just run it

643
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:06,599
for two values, for example, we had

644
00:39:06,599 --> 00:39:08,760
talked about two values ​​as they could be

645
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:13,260
in two and three we will see what happens

646
00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:16,079
for the first of the expressions and the

647
00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:18,839
first of the extensions passing x

648
00:39:18,839 --> 00:39:22,740
like 2 and way like 3 returns 5 Is

649
00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:24,780
say 2 + 3

650
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:27,599
= 5 the second of the expressions

651
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:29,579
returns 5 and the third of the

652
00:39:29,579 --> 00:39:32,280
expressions and returns it 5 also with

653
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:34,800
which we could affirm we could

654
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:37,980
demonstrate here in this case the principle

655
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:41,520
that we have seen logically are not the

656
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:45,900
unique I might even introduce

657
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:49,740
a fourth that sees me and we already have it

658
00:39:49,740 --> 00:39:50,660
written

659
00:39:50,660 --> 00:39:53,940
a fourth expression where we spend so much

660
00:39:53,940 --> 00:39:56,880
x as y where we are going to return here in

661
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:59,280
this case we would return the result

662
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:04,380
that here would be and less the not in this

663
00:40:04,380 --> 00:40:07,920
case then x minus 1

664
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:10,980
let's disconnect

665
00:40:10,980 --> 00:40:14,579
this line and where we are going to use

666
00:40:14,579 --> 00:40:16,920
logically. Well, from this expression of

667
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:19,380
this fourth pressure

668
00:40:19,380 --> 00:40:21,780
we save the code we are going to return to

669
00:40:21,780 --> 00:40:25,680
combine it because I already have it object and

670
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:28,079
let's try here in this case for

671
00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:30,839
see if the first second third that

672
00:40:30,839 --> 00:40:32,760
we had previously shown are

673
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:35,760
exactly the same as the fourth

674
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:36,980
expression

675
00:40:36,980 --> 00:40:39,619
as we see here then logically

676
00:40:39,619 --> 00:40:42,780
all expressions will return the

677
00:40:42,780 --> 00:40:45,540
same result we had played

678
00:40:45,540 --> 00:40:47,280
still here we are playing in a ring

679
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:52,260
logically 32-bit, that is, we play

680
00:40:52,260 --> 00:40:54,300
with variables right now we are

681
00:40:54,300 --> 00:40:57,119
playing around with 8 bit variables with lo

682
00:40:57,119 --> 00:40:59,460
which allows us to store values ​​between 0

683
00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:03,960
And 255 what would happen For example if I

684
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:05,119
had

685
00:41:05,119 --> 00:41:08,660
yes let's say

686
00:41:08,660 --> 00:41:10,740
we tried to provoke some kind of

687
00:41:10,740 --> 00:41:13,680
overflow we tried to overflow by

688
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:16,880
example this with values ​​then type as

689
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:21,359
255 for x and Paraguay for example the

690
00:41:21,359 --> 00:41:24,480
value 3 we would see here in this case that

691
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:27,720
we are inside a cyclic ring

692
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:29,220
say when we play with what would be

693
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:32,520
the expressions are both within

694
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:34,920
what would be a ring with which here

695
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:37,579
we have exceeded the value

696
00:41:37,579 --> 00:41:41,339
we would continue counting on the 256 Well

697
00:41:41,339 --> 00:41:43,460
we would start with the

698
00:41:43,460 --> 00:41:47,940
3-012 as we could see here with what

699
00:41:47,940 --> 00:41:50,339
which then we would not have any type of

700
00:41:50,339 --> 00:41:54,180
problem when trying and playing with

701
00:41:54,180 --> 00:41:56,700
so different results

702
00:41:56,700 --> 00:41:58,740
going back to what would be the presentation

703
00:41:58,740 --> 00:42:01,760
we could affirm that complexity

704
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:04,560
syntactic and now

705
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:07,079
I could Well here in this case

706
00:42:07,079 --> 00:42:12,740
basically use what would be

707
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:17,359
where will there be like GB

708
00:42:18,300 --> 00:42:22,400
and where Well here in this case we could

709
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:24,780
we could any of the functions

710
00:42:24,780 --> 00:42:27,960
that we have used we could see

711
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:30,859
logically

712
00:42:32,220 --> 00:42:34,320
here we have the Main function to where

713
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:37,020
call then for each of the

714
00:42:37,020 --> 00:42:40,020
functions as we could see for example

715
00:42:40,020 --> 00:42:46,520
e1 E2 good two out of three e4

716
00:42:47,579 --> 00:42:51,359
Well I have it on at&t I could have it

717
00:42:51,359 --> 00:42:54,359
put in Intel but

718
00:42:54,359 --> 00:42:58,140
I think to see the simple complexity

719
00:42:58,140 --> 00:43:00,780
notice how it changes from some functions to

720
00:43:00,780 --> 00:43:03,300
others or a function such as

721
00:43:03,300 --> 00:43:06,000
just one where it really has

722
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,099
beaten we would be

723
00:43:08,099 --> 00:43:10,099
directly seeing

724
00:43:10,099 --> 00:43:12,540
that changes and that is not the same

725
00:43:12,540 --> 00:43:15,240
write it logically When this

726
00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:18,540
It has been complicated, it is not the same outside

727
00:43:18,540 --> 00:43:21,380
Well, of course we

728
00:43:21,380 --> 00:43:23,940
this demonstration we should

729
00:43:23,940 --> 00:43:26,099
prove it we could solve it

730
00:43:26,099 --> 00:43:28,500
logically Well with a solver

731
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:31,619
logically we are not going to duplicate here

732
00:43:31,619 --> 00:43:33,780
In this case, we have to solve for

733
00:43:33,780 --> 00:43:36,540
example in python as z3 which we are going to

734
00:43:36,540 --> 00:43:38,940
allow to define what would be the

735
00:43:38,940 --> 00:43:41,280
expressions and be able to prove that the

736
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:42,839
people here in this case are

737
00:43:42,839 --> 00:43:45,900
equivalents we go with our second

738
00:43:45,900 --> 00:43:48,800
demonstration

739
00:43:53,220 --> 00:43:56,839
where are we going to see

740
00:43:57,599 --> 00:44:01,520
simply where am I going to define

741
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:04,560
here in this case Well of the z3 that is

742
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:06,420
absorb we'll expand where we're going

743
00:44:06,420 --> 00:44:08,640
to define Well, that first variable x

744
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:11,760
with 8 bits this second variable with 8

745
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:14,520
bits this third variable for when

746
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:17,160
I use it with 8 bits and I'm going to work

747
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:19,920
then with this first expression for

748
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:22,319
example this first expression I want

749
00:44:22,319 --> 00:44:26,119
prove that this mba is equivalent

750
00:44:26,119 --> 00:44:29,180
I will continue with the code

751
00:44:29,180 --> 00:44:32,579
since this equivalent to the expression

752
00:44:32,579 --> 00:44:36,180
simplified form of x + y since we do not have

753
00:44:36,180 --> 00:44:39,960
desire between quotes to break our

754
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:42,720
head just we are going to

755
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:45,540
tell it to solve so try it

756
00:44:45,540 --> 00:44:47,940
Show us if it is equivalent or not

757
00:44:47,940 --> 00:44:50,460
For it

758
00:44:50,460 --> 00:44:53,359
simply

759
00:44:54,060 --> 00:44:59,880
We let him work and he doesn't show if

760
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:04,319
the expression is in this case equivalent

761
00:45:04,319 --> 00:45:07,280
let's try another expression

762
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:11,640
imagine that I say instead of 2 I'm going to

763
00:45:11,640 --> 00:45:15,420
put a 3 I'm going to check if these two

764
00:45:15,420 --> 00:45:18,800
expressions are equivalent here

765
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:21,420
we would see logically that they are not here

766
00:45:21,420 --> 00:45:24,740
we would see what we have

767
00:45:24,740 --> 00:45:28,079
in certain cases for which it is not

768
00:45:28,079 --> 00:45:29,819
comply with which we could not

769
00:45:29,819 --> 00:45:32,300
show

770
00:45:32,660 --> 00:45:36,180
Let's try another expression Well, we

771
00:45:36,180 --> 00:45:37,920
I would leave 2, which was what we had

772
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:40,800
done before let's try another

773
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:42,480
expression of the gems used before

774
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:45,540
this one that he corresponded with the door

775
00:45:45,540 --> 00:45:50,060
expression Well, by the fourth pressure

776
00:45:50,220 --> 00:45:53,220
we're going to try it

777
00:45:53,220 --> 00:45:56,880
we see that they are actually fulfilled

778
00:45:56,880 --> 00:46:00,480
We are going to try the third of the

779
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:02,060
expressions we had tried before

780
00:46:02,060 --> 00:46:06,240
an expression that was as to the

781
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:08,099
code complexity the most code

782
00:46:08,099 --> 00:46:12,300
generated and that finally is the

783
00:46:12,300 --> 00:46:15,180
equivalent of simply writing X +

784
00:46:15,180 --> 00:46:17,419
Y

785
00:46:18,420 --> 00:46:21,000
we're going to try it

786
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:24,300
we see that it is equivalent

787
00:46:24,300 --> 00:46:27,660
and we are going to play now with another expression

788
00:46:27,660 --> 00:46:31,800
with another mba a little more complex this one

789
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:35,819
in the complete NBA Now me inside

790
00:46:35,819 --> 00:46:39,240
This mba is not just going to play with

791
00:46:39,240 --> 00:46:42,300
what would be x this variable but that

792
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:45,200
I am going to introduce some other variable

793
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:48,180
I am going to introduce up to a total of three

794
00:46:48,180 --> 00:46:49,099
variables

795
00:46:49,099 --> 00:46:54,180
Well I'm going to try to prove that it is here

796
00:46:54,180 --> 00:46:56,099
in this case Well it is not necessary how

797
00:46:56,099 --> 00:47:00,740
you know python the linear

798
00:47:03,300 --> 00:47:04,819
With which

799
00:47:04,819 --> 00:47:07,200
continued later I define it again well

800
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:09,900
there would be no problem

801
00:47:09,900 --> 00:47:12,599
I want to show that all this

802
00:47:12,599 --> 00:47:14,760
expression that is equivalent to a

803
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:17,520
expression such that it would be the expression

804
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:21,960
simplified x + y + x + Z here in this

805
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:25,579
case using three variables

806
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:30,599
we just keep

807
00:47:31,859 --> 00:47:36,180
here we observe that we have is not

808
00:47:36,180 --> 00:47:38,280
equivalent is not equivalent with what

809
00:47:38,280 --> 00:47:41,099
which one should we look for this

810
00:47:41,099 --> 00:47:42,780
expression Well, we should

811
00:47:42,780 --> 00:47:45,540
look for something that would generate us a

812
00:47:45,540 --> 00:47:47,819
royal expression

813
00:47:47,819 --> 00:47:50,520
that he did not return here that we

814
00:47:50,520 --> 00:47:51,960
returned

815
00:47:51,960 --> 00:47:54,359
those three variables

816
00:47:54,359 --> 00:47:57,720
I am going to comment those variables I am going to

817
00:47:57,720 --> 00:48:00,599
simply leave what would be very going to

818
00:48:00,599 --> 00:48:02,460
see if by chance

819
00:48:02,460 --> 00:48:06,920
best equivalent to X + Y

820
00:48:08,540 --> 00:48:10,220
we see

821
00:48:10,220 --> 00:48:12,960
it will take a little longer logically it is

822
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:16,400
a much more complex expression

823
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:21,780
Before the jumped is follow

824
00:48:21,780 --> 00:48:25,859
being of two variables then it is X + Y

825
00:48:25,859 --> 00:48:28,140
it takes as you will be able to verify in

826
00:48:28,140 --> 00:48:30,560
real time

827
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:35,400
And what is a solver imagine being

828
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:37,500
imagine if we had to

829
00:48:37,500 --> 00:48:40,079
do everything by hand

830
00:48:40,079 --> 00:48:42,720
finally does not show that the pressure

831
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:46,440
which is correct and finally

832
00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:50,160
We are going to test with three variables

833
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:52,500
that expression where I am going to use those

834
00:48:52,500 --> 00:48:54,079
three variables

835
00:48:54,079 --> 00:48:58,560
and we are going to prove that it is equivalent in

836
00:48:58,560 --> 00:49:00,480
instead of writing this that would be trivial

837
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:02,339
within our code we could

838
00:49:02,339 --> 00:49:05,359
change it and write

839
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:10,619
we see that it comes back here in this case

840
00:49:10,619 --> 00:49:14,220
go back to

841
00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:15,800
Us

842
00:49:15,800 --> 00:49:18,960
We are also going to have something else

843
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:21,180
are the opaque constants a constant

844
00:49:21,180 --> 00:49:24,000
we know that it is a value that does not change to

845
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:25,680
over time within what

846
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:26,880
would be our code for example

847
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:29,940
we could define a constant x equal

848
00:49:29,940 --> 00:49:32,880
to 3 in our code and another constant and

849
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:34,640
equal to 2

850
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:37,440
for us. The problem is that this

851
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:39,420
would be trivial when making a

852
00:49:39,420 --> 00:49:41,160
reverse Our goal will be

853
00:49:41,160 --> 00:49:44,040
simply hide a constant K What

854
00:49:44,040 --> 00:49:45,599
we are going to do we are going to combine what

855
00:49:45,599 --> 00:49:47,520
it would be the expressions both

856
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:49,440
along with what are the polynomials of

857
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:50,640
permutation

858
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:53,099
we have a rule which is that for

859
00:49:53,099 --> 00:49:55,859
any permutation polynomial p goes

860
00:49:55,859 --> 00:49:57,720
to always insist another Q that is going to

861
00:49:57,720 --> 00:49:59,460
define the inverse. That is, for all

862
00:49:59,460 --> 00:50:02,099
the denevits values ​​for x let's

863
00:50:02,099 --> 00:50:05,940
get the p of qx to return x

864
00:50:05,940 --> 00:50:08,339
with which we will be able to logically

865
00:50:08,339 --> 00:50:09,560
use

866
00:50:09,560 --> 00:50:11,880
K for us is going to be what it would be

867
00:50:11,880 --> 00:50:13,560
a benevix constant we want

868
00:50:13,560 --> 00:50:16,140
hide both p and q will be

869
00:50:16,140 --> 00:50:18,599
polynomials that will comply with the

870
00:50:18,599 --> 00:50:20,280
coefficients for the coefficients of

871
00:50:20,280 --> 00:50:22,560
nebits and will act as the inverse of 11

872
00:50:22,560 --> 00:50:25,800
i.e. p of q of X will return x

873
00:50:25,800 --> 00:50:28,920
for all x and our e will be

874
00:50:28,920 --> 00:50:31,440
any of the nbas expressions we have

875
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:34,619
seen with variables benedits ok with

876
00:50:34,619 --> 00:50:38,760
that we this constant K lo va Lo

877
00:50:38,760 --> 00:50:40,740
we will be able to replace instead of putting

878
00:50:40,740 --> 00:50:43,020
a constant x we ​​will be able to

879
00:50:43,020 --> 00:50:46,740
replace by p from the expression that

880
00:50:46,740 --> 00:50:49,319
we have is going to be for any of the

881
00:50:49,319 --> 00:50:50,579
values

882
00:50:50,579 --> 00:50:55,260
from x1 to x for example a primer

883
00:50:55,260 --> 00:51:00,240
polynomial a pdx that would be 97 x + 448 x

884
00:51:00,240 --> 00:51:03,300
squared a qx a second polynomial

885
00:51:03,300 --> 00:51:08,640
which is the inverse of 161x + 136 x to

886
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:12,480
squared and the expression e of x and what

887
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:14,880
I am going to use it will be Well this MVA

888
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:18,720
that we have with which then logically

889
00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:21,559
we could create an expression

890
00:51:21,559 --> 00:51:24,960
an opaque constant but that in no

891
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:27,660
moment will reveal what would be here

892
00:51:27,660 --> 00:51:30,599
in this case the real value it has and

893
00:51:30,599 --> 00:51:32,640
is going to complicate enormously what would be

894
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:35,220
its reversible for this we are going to use

895
00:51:35,220 --> 00:51:38,160
what would be the part of the z3 let's

896
00:51:38,160 --> 00:51:41,339
define our x our polynomial

897
00:51:41,339 --> 00:51:44,339
our polynomial that we are going to define what

898
00:51:44,339 --> 00:51:45,839
which would be the expression we want and

899
00:51:45,839 --> 00:51:47,760
let us calculate what it would be

900
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:50,640
just the constant and

901
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:53,700
not of the opaque constant simplify it

902
00:51:53,700 --> 00:51:56,579
and with which we could here in this

903
00:51:56,579 --> 00:52:00,319
case play with it for it

904
00:52:00,319 --> 00:52:04,460
we have prepared another demo

905
00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:11,460
this is where we see the code and the

906
00:52:11,460 --> 00:52:13,980
code we want that is us

907
00:52:13,980 --> 00:52:15,780
costing opaque Well here in this case

908
00:52:15,780 --> 00:52:17,240
be

909
00:52:17,240 --> 00:52:19,680
we want to store in the code the value

910
00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:23,040
23 that the value 23 could be by

911
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:25,579
example the ordinal in asking

912
00:52:25,579 --> 00:52:28,920
corresponding to character number 23 of

913
00:52:28,920 --> 00:52:32,640
the table could thus be for example the

914
00:52:32,640 --> 00:52:34,819
system cool number 23

915
00:52:34,819 --> 00:52:37,380
then maybe with this first

916
00:52:37,380 --> 00:52:39,720
constant and another constant that I hid

917
00:52:39,720 --> 00:52:44,160
Maybe their sum is the System Cold of

918
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:47,460
Windows 11 then to perform certain

919
00:52:47,460 --> 00:52:49,980
operation instead of putting it both ideal

920
00:52:49,980 --> 00:52:51,839
how to make cool assistant call

921
00:52:51,839 --> 00:52:54,000
I could hide it using these

922
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,220
things before I'm going to play in the space of

923
00:52:56,220 --> 00:52:58,920
8 bits I'm going to initialize what it would be

924
00:52:58,920 --> 00:53:00,480
since the equations with the number of

925
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:03,660
bits that I have put we define p we define

926
00:53:03,660 --> 00:53:06,000
or this could be Here I have

927
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:07,500
different polynomials

928
00:53:07,500 --> 00:53:10,020
and we are going to define here in this case what

929
00:53:10,020 --> 00:53:12,059
that would be by the expression that we go

930
00:53:12,059 --> 00:53:14,040
searching

931
00:53:14,040 --> 00:53:17,780
let's here in this case calculate

932
00:53:17,780 --> 00:53:20,400
could be for example as I had A

933
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:22,040
the best imagine Well the port

934
00:53:22,040 --> 00:53:25,740
it could be a port number it works for us

935
00:53:25,740 --> 00:53:27,839
for all things and here we go

936
00:53:27,839 --> 00:53:30,000
simply define what would be us

937
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:31,980
is liking opaque and that the in

938
00:53:31,980 --> 00:53:33,059
beginning

939
00:53:33,059 --> 00:53:36,960
let's try it let's see the number

940
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:39,960
23 how could we hide it in the

941
00:53:39,960 --> 00:53:42,800
code so that it was not so ideal

942
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:50,059
Well, the number 23 would be equivalent

943
00:53:50,059 --> 00:53:53,640
it would be equivalent to be able to express it as

944
00:53:53,640 --> 00:54:01,740
31 plus 97 for x plus 159 for y plus 194

945
00:54:01,740 --> 00:54:03,079
for

946
00:54:03,079 --> 00:54:10,380
not x for not and plus 159 x to not plus 8 plus

947
00:54:10,380 --> 00:54:13,200
etcetera etcetera etcetera etcetera

948
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:17,220
You can logically imagine that for

949
00:54:17,220 --> 00:54:19,800
that number 23 Well that we

950
00:54:19,800 --> 00:54:22,640
we wanted to hide logically

951
00:54:22,640 --> 00:54:25,339
we are no longer

952
00:54:25,339 --> 00:54:28,200
indicating it as it is but that we

953
00:54:28,200 --> 00:54:31,140
we have complicated when compiling

954
00:54:31,140 --> 00:54:33,000
this code logically

955
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,460
complicated enough

956
00:54:35,460 --> 00:54:38,099
This is going to allow me according to

957
00:54:38,099 --> 00:54:40,319
I say if I wanted to hide the number 2 the

958
00:54:40,319 --> 00:54:42,480
number 3 and then perform the sum of the

959
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:45,480
number 2 plus a number 3 well I can

960
00:54:45,480 --> 00:54:47,280
do and i can play inside the space

961
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:53,220
8, 16, 32 or 64 bits depending on

962
00:54:53,220 --> 00:54:57,359
than to me But logically I don't

963
00:54:57,359 --> 00:55:00,500
I would trust if he told me that

964
00:55:00,500 --> 00:55:03,920
all this result that you have put here

965
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:07,680
that gives the number 23 would have to

966
00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:09,900
prove it logically mathematically

967
00:55:09,900 --> 00:55:12,480
speaking we would have to demo

968
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:15,180
Well, logically we could prove it.

969
00:55:15,180 --> 00:55:18,380
again by solving

970
00:55:18,380 --> 00:55:21,540
Well, defining is not costing opaque

971
00:55:21,540 --> 00:55:23,940
what it returns and just testing

972
00:55:23,940 --> 00:55:26,520
which is equivalent to what we

973
00:55:26,520 --> 00:55:30,240
We are looking for it because we are going to see if

974
00:55:30,240 --> 00:55:32,479
it is right

975
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:40,800
and let's see this code

976
00:55:40,800 --> 00:55:43,559
where? Well, it's costing us here

977
00:55:43,559 --> 00:55:46,319
it was the 23rd that we took it out well it is

978
00:55:46,319 --> 00:55:48,000
nonsense but to remember today that

979
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:51,839
It is September 8, 2022

980
00:55:51,839 --> 00:55:53,119
done then

981
00:55:53,119 --> 00:55:56,359
They are the holidays of my homeland

982
00:55:56,359 --> 00:56:00,079
they started start today and

983
00:56:00,079 --> 00:56:02,520
is the saint of the patron saint of there with what

984
00:56:02,520 --> 00:56:04,619
what if there is someone from albacete well

985
00:56:04,619 --> 00:56:06,240
I live to the Virgen de los Llanos and that is why

986
00:56:06,240 --> 00:56:08,220
since all that sum is good

987
00:56:08,220 --> 00:56:10,500
we simply initialize what are the

988
00:56:10,500 --> 00:56:12,599
vectors we define the opaque constant

989
00:56:12,599 --> 00:56:15,300
What I have put here has been Well, the

990
00:56:15,300 --> 00:56:17,220
result that had given me before and

991
00:56:17,220 --> 00:56:19,260
simply what we want is that

992
00:56:19,260 --> 00:56:20,400
I try

993
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:24,420
Today we are going to see if it is correct for what

994
00:56:24,420 --> 00:56:26,900
try it

995
00:56:28,740 --> 00:56:31,319
and we see that indeed it has been

996
00:56:31,319 --> 00:56:33,660
Right

997
00:56:33,660 --> 00:56:37,140
let's go back to the third demo and for

998
00:56:37,140 --> 00:56:38,579
let them see the code working

999
00:56:38,579 --> 00:56:40,920
Well, I don't care about the cost here

1000
00:56:40,920 --> 00:56:43,680
logically if I'm playing with 8 bits

1001
00:56:43,680 --> 00:56:48,059
I can save values ​​between 0 and 255 no

1002
00:56:48,059 --> 00:56:49,380
I know if there will be any questions but

1003
00:56:49,380 --> 00:56:52,500
imagine well I want to save now the

1004
00:56:52,500 --> 00:56:56,160
costing opaque 230 they have added a 0

1005
00:56:56,160 --> 00:56:58,440
because normally if we were there

1006
00:56:58,440 --> 00:57:01,980
in person there would always be someone

1007
00:57:01,980 --> 00:57:04,380
volunteer to be able to do it I will

1008
00:57:04,380 --> 00:57:07,920
generate this costing opaque and

1009
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:10,140
I returned

1010
00:57:10,140 --> 00:57:12,359
this expression

1011
00:57:12,359 --> 00:57:16,220
and now we are going to check

1012
00:57:18,599 --> 00:57:21,599
if it is correct that we had hidden it was

1013
00:57:21,599 --> 00:57:24,599
230

1014
00:57:27,480 --> 00:57:28,760
and now

1015
00:57:28,760 --> 00:57:31,920
to us the result Thankfully

1016
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:35,480
I copied it did not return all that

1017
00:57:39,480 --> 00:57:43,040
i will put it in one line

1018
00:57:44,280 --> 00:57:46,859
for not using the separators good

1019
00:57:46,859 --> 00:57:50,160
This is the opaque costing instead of

1020
00:57:50,160 --> 00:57:53,420
use the number Sorry I put here

1021
00:57:53,420 --> 00:57:56,760
instead of using Well the number

1022
00:57:56,760 --> 00:57:59,760
230

1023
00:57:59,819 --> 00:58:02,280
the equivalent if they do not want to use

1024
00:58:02,280 --> 00:58:04,200
This is what it would look like directly

1025
00:58:04,200 --> 00:58:07,260
simply put that in your code and

1026
00:58:07,260 --> 00:58:09,240
when compiled

1027
00:58:09,240 --> 00:58:13,040
if this stay proven

1028
00:58:16,079 --> 00:58:20,180
as we have just shown logically

1029
00:58:20,180 --> 00:58:23,400
they will see that code in Seeder

1030
00:58:23,400 --> 00:58:27,240
it is much more complex

1031
00:58:27,240 --> 00:58:30,000
Well, at this point, what are they?

1032
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:31,980
the cases for example of use that

1033
00:58:31,980 --> 00:58:34,680
we would have to imagine many times Well

1034
00:58:34,680 --> 00:58:36,540
when we want to hide a vector by

1035
00:58:36,540 --> 00:58:39,180
example a and v when we want to hide

1036
00:58:39,180 --> 00:58:42,119
for example an ipv4 address including

1037
00:58:42,119 --> 00:58:45,180
its objects or the entire

1038
00:58:45,180 --> 00:58:47,760
address expressed as a value in

1039
00:58:47,760 --> 00:58:52,079
hexadecimal Well, an exam what

1040
00:58:52,079 --> 00:58:54,380
we want an address for example ipv6

1041
00:58:54,380 --> 00:58:57,599
a by the ride with some the code where

1042
00:58:57,599 --> 00:59:00,059
Well, the typical values ​​that

1043
00:59:00,059 --> 00:59:04,740
So we put x I don't know 23 x 0 etc.

1044
00:59:04,740 --> 00:59:06,960
etc. we will be able to go to all that

1045
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:09,540
saving to pass it as arguments

1046
00:59:09,540 --> 00:59:11,520
for example of functions to pass

1047
00:59:11,520 --> 00:59:14,040
memory addresses in both 32 and

1048
00:59:14,040 --> 00:59:18,319
in 64 bits or good Even in 8 or 16

1049
00:59:18,319 --> 00:59:20,640
logically I am doing the

1050
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:22,980
examples with 8-bit values ​​that are

1051
00:59:22,980 --> 00:59:25,140
the simplest and the ones that can be

1052
00:59:25,140 --> 00:59:27,720
understand even could still play

1053
00:59:27,720 --> 00:59:28,980
with less but good I would keep

1054
00:59:28,980 --> 00:59:31,680
logically then fewer values ​​for

1055
00:59:31,680 --> 00:59:34,619
numbers of síscolos etcetera etcetera is

1056
00:59:34,619 --> 00:59:37,980
say We have many use cases and

1057
00:59:37,980 --> 00:59:39,980
many utilities where we can

1058
00:59:39,980 --> 00:59:43,440
logically apply it logically until

1059
00:59:43,440 --> 00:59:45,660
now we have seen a single expression of

1060
00:59:45,660 --> 00:59:49,980
both the x + y but there are more then

1061
00:59:49,980 --> 00:59:53,220
so far we have seen that x + y was

1062
00:59:53,220 --> 00:59:55,440
equivalent of this and at most we have

1063
00:59:55,440 --> 01:00:00,000
seen four expressions in total MB in

1064
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,099
formulating we could say that

1065
01:00:02,099 --> 01:00:04,200
this one that is more like that is also

1066
01:00:04,200 --> 01:00:08,400
equivalent to this other expression to this

1067
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:09,740
other pressure

1068
01:00:09,740 --> 01:00:13,260
to that other to this other to this to this

1069
01:00:13,260 --> 01:00:15,240
this this this this this this

1070
01:00:15,240 --> 01:00:19,980
to these and he asks me, are they not the

1071
01:00:19,980 --> 01:00:23,099
unique there are many more Which ones do we want

1072
01:00:23,099 --> 01:00:24,559
use you

1073
01:00:24,559 --> 01:00:28,740
Well, they can use the one they want or the

1074
01:00:28,740 --> 01:00:31,440
that you can generate

1075
01:00:31,440 --> 01:00:34,859
but not only do we have x + y we have

1076
01:00:34,859 --> 01:00:37,500
other expressions because there will be times that

1077
01:00:37,500 --> 01:00:38,900
maybe we want

1078
01:00:38,900 --> 01:00:41,480
imagine a number of points

1079
01:00:41,480 --> 01:00:44,220
Imagine that we want to connect to the

1080
01:00:44,220 --> 01:00:48,720
port 22, for example for an ssh

1081
01:00:48,720 --> 01:00:50,940
Well, maybe I would hide one

1082
01:00:50,940 --> 01:00:53,540
opaque constant that was the number 25

1083
01:00:53,540 --> 01:00:56,400
an opaque constant that was the number

1084
01:00:56,400 --> 01:00:59,880
3 and what I ran to get the

1085
01:00:59,880 --> 01:01:02,760
number 22 the port number 22 would be

1086
01:01:02,760 --> 01:01:06,380
subtract 25 minus 3 which gives me 22

1087
01:01:06,380 --> 01:01:10,140
Well, I could play with an expression of

1088
01:01:10,140 --> 01:01:14,040
subtraction as team minus y x minus

1089
01:01:14,040 --> 01:01:17,520
and it would be equivalent to this mba that

1090
01:01:17,520 --> 01:01:20,700
you can check here but

1091
01:01:20,700 --> 01:01:23,819
As you come here we can go

1092
01:01:23,819 --> 01:01:26,940
playing and we can generate many

1093
01:01:26,940 --> 01:01:30,000
mba professions like the one who says

1094
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:31,799
we are playing well in a ring

1095
01:01:31,799 --> 01:01:33,480
we practically move in a ring

1096
01:01:33,480 --> 01:01:35,180
of infinite numbers

1097
01:01:35,180 --> 01:01:37,520
logically we are

1098
01:01:37,520 --> 01:01:41,099
conditional on the employment of the 8/16 32 or

1099
01:01:41,099 --> 01:01:43,799
64 bits But this logically has

1100
01:01:43,799 --> 01:01:46,339
a very high entropy and

1101
01:01:46,339 --> 01:01:49,859
we will be able to play with the actions

1102
01:01:49,859 --> 01:01:52,380
polynomials because we are going to be able to generate

1103
01:01:52,380 --> 01:01:56,000
any type of company

1104
01:01:56,059 --> 01:01:59,280
until now according to Come here I was

1105
01:01:59,280 --> 01:02:02,099
playing solely and exclusively with two

1106
01:02:02,099 --> 01:02:05,640
variants but could play with more

1107
01:02:05,640 --> 01:02:08,520
variables, for example three

1108
01:02:08,520 --> 01:02:11,880
variables and six or seven terms Well

1109
01:02:11,880 --> 01:02:17,400
here this is equivalent of X plus y is

1110
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:20,099
say a sum because as we had

1111
01:02:20,099 --> 01:02:22,500
put in the previous example for

1112
01:02:22,500 --> 01:02:26,099
get Well I don't know imagine that

1113
01:02:26,099 --> 01:02:28,319
we want to open in some elcos that

1114
01:02:28,319 --> 01:02:31,619
let's say we want to open port 22

1115
01:02:31,619 --> 01:02:34,440
local well but we don't want that to be

1116
01:02:34,440 --> 01:02:37,799
look logically inside the code then

1117
01:02:37,799 --> 01:02:39,960
we could add in this case then to the

1118
01:02:39,960 --> 01:02:43,380
better value a value of 10 and another

1119
01:02:43,380 --> 01:02:47,339
value of 12 100 plus 12 equals 22 then

1120
01:02:47,339 --> 01:02:50,280
we could use an expression of two

1121
01:02:50,280 --> 01:02:54,359
variables or 10 plus 10 Well I'm going to

1122
01:02:54,359 --> 01:02:57,079
put let's go a little

1123
01:02:57,079 --> 01:02:59,640
So, for example, a first variable

1124
01:02:59,640 --> 01:03:02,220
for three variables then 10 the first

1125
01:03:02,220 --> 01:03:05,460
variable another second variable Let's

1126
01:03:05,460 --> 01:03:07,040
put 11

1127
01:03:07,040 --> 01:03:13,920
and a third variable 1 since 10 plus 10

1128
01:03:13,920 --> 01:03:16,920
1 look with three variables and six

1129
01:03:16,920 --> 01:03:20,339
seven terms what we are logically

1130
01:03:20,339 --> 01:03:24,599
capable of generating But that logically

1131
01:03:24,599 --> 01:03:27,839
It does not stop here, we can expand

1132
01:03:27,839 --> 01:03:31,140
for example simply three variables and

1133
01:03:31,140 --> 01:03:33,240
41 terms

1134
01:03:33,240 --> 01:03:36,680
Can you imagine this expression?

1135
01:03:36,680 --> 01:03:41,339
when we see it logically that the one that

1136
01:03:41,339 --> 01:03:44,040
a developer who knows that and

1137
01:03:44,040 --> 01:03:47,119
have generated then

1138
01:03:47,119 --> 01:03:50,880
has passed those arguments only function and

1139
01:03:50,880 --> 01:03:53,400
from here we know logically i

1140
01:03:53,400 --> 01:03:55,799
I'm just explaining because we know that

1141
01:03:55,799 --> 01:03:59,099
this is going to give at the end the number 22 for

1142
01:03:59,099 --> 01:04:01,640
open them and use the port but

1143
01:04:01,640 --> 01:04:04,500
logically you imagine in the complexity

1144
01:04:04,500 --> 01:04:07,740
that would present within the universe

1145
01:04:07,740 --> 01:04:11,400
but we do not end here and if we used

1146
01:04:11,400 --> 01:04:14,220
four variables and 47 terms per

1147
01:04:14,220 --> 01:04:17,339
example as you see in this expression

1148
01:04:17,339 --> 01:04:20,220
all this. Even if they see it that way, they are not

1149
01:04:20,220 --> 01:04:21,839
different expressions in the same

1150
01:04:21,839 --> 01:04:23,040
expression that does not fit me

1151
01:04:23,040 --> 01:04:26,220
Powerpoint but we could continue

1152
01:04:26,220 --> 01:04:29,220
playing I tell you for Puerto de

1153
01:04:29,220 --> 01:04:31,380
ipv4 addresses for texts like

1154
01:04:31,380 --> 01:04:33,559
decimals

1155
01:04:33,559 --> 01:04:38,760
rc4a 256 in cbc mode we could use it

1156
01:04:38,760 --> 01:04:41,640
for any kind of things

1157
01:04:41,640 --> 01:04:43,880
we would even like

1158
01:04:43,880 --> 01:04:47,520
Imagine if I, for example, well in

1159
01:04:47,520 --> 01:04:50,400
base to a second that corresponds in

1160
01:04:50,400 --> 01:04:52,319
depending on the local time that the

1161
01:04:52,319 --> 01:04:56,460
team I am going to use one mba or another is

1162
01:04:56,460 --> 01:04:58,740
say in the first second job the NBA

1163
01:04:58,740 --> 01:05:02,400
1 second number 2 job nba number

1164
01:05:02,400 --> 01:05:08,000
2 second number 3 mba3 mba 4 mba5 and so on

1165
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:11,160
imagine the complexity it would have here

1166
01:05:11,160 --> 01:05:15,200
In this case, well, a real one. Yes, let's see.

1167
01:05:15,200 --> 01:05:17,520
a small example

1168
01:05:17,520 --> 01:05:21,140
that I have prepared characteristics

1169
01:05:22,920 --> 01:05:25,740
Well, let's see first

1170
01:05:25,740 --> 01:05:28,578
what would be the code

1171
01:05:28,619 --> 01:05:30,740
the code is very easy

1172
01:05:30,740 --> 01:05:33,000
here in this case we are going to

1173
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:35,640
compile it but optimizations before I have

1174
01:05:35,640 --> 01:05:37,440
used in the optimizations here on

1175
01:05:37,440 --> 01:05:40,500
In this case we could remove them because

1176
01:05:40,500 --> 01:05:43,260
then we will see the conclusions and here

1177
01:05:43,260 --> 01:05:45,900
Well, we simply obtain what is the

1178
01:05:45,900 --> 01:05:48,079
second

1179
01:05:51,119 --> 01:05:54,780
here with this function as a function of X e

1180
01:05:54,780 --> 01:05:57,359
And then we are going to return the sum that is to say

1181
01:05:57,359 --> 01:06:00,420
what we know and here I am going to have

1182
01:06:00,420 --> 01:06:04,260
a function to be by Time where

1183
01:06:04,260 --> 01:06:08,180
Well I'm going to have the second

1184
01:06:08,180 --> 01:06:11,040
just to understand a

1185
01:06:11,040 --> 01:06:13,319
little bit what would be the code for

1186
01:06:13,319 --> 01:06:15,180
simplify it instead of using 60

1187
01:06:15,180 --> 01:06:17,520
expressions or with the 60 Seconds that

1188
01:06:17,520 --> 01:06:19,380
we have what I have done has been Well

1189
01:06:19,380 --> 01:06:23,339
only with 18 pressures then I get

1190
01:06:23,339 --> 01:06:25,980
One second I do the module with 18 if

1191
01:06:25,980 --> 01:06:30,420
output 0 I will use this expression if

1192
01:06:30,420 --> 01:06:32,700
is the 1 i will use this second mba

1193
01:06:32,700 --> 01:06:36,299
and if you realize this is the polynomial

1194
01:06:36,299 --> 01:06:40,400
What do we find on the lids?

1195
01:06:40,400 --> 01:06:43,940
then i will use this

1196
01:06:43,940 --> 01:06:46,920
this second third fourth fifth sixth

1197
01:06:46,920 --> 01:06:50,039
seventh like this up to a total of

1198
01:06:50,039 --> 01:06:51,680
the 18

1199
01:06:51,680 --> 01:06:54,900
mbas simple expressions that we are going to

1200
01:06:54,900 --> 01:06:57,839
use on this computer and in this code

1201
01:06:57,839 --> 01:06:59,520
forgiveness

1202
01:06:59,520 --> 01:07:02,538
and simply

1203
01:07:03,059 --> 01:07:05,460
we are going to remove well I am not going to do it either

1204
01:07:05,460 --> 01:07:08,099
backwards 5 with which it quotes more

1205
01:07:08,099 --> 01:07:09,780
optimize less later in the

1206
01:07:09,780 --> 01:07:13,079
conclusions we will see then we are going to

1207
01:07:13,079 --> 01:07:15,539
generate the mba time

1208
01:07:15,539 --> 01:07:20,039
and let's try it mba time for example

1209
01:07:20,039 --> 01:07:21,720
these two numbers that these are

1210
01:07:21,720 --> 01:07:23,819
constants but they are not opaque constants

1211
01:07:23,819 --> 01:07:26,700
I should then logically here

1212
01:07:26,700 --> 01:07:31,200
this should generate those constants

1213
01:07:31,200 --> 01:07:34,079
is solely and exclusively for

1214
01:07:34,079 --> 01:07:36,420
we can understand it we can check it

1215
01:07:36,420 --> 01:07:38,220
no more

1216
01:07:38,220 --> 01:07:40,859
Well right now the expression that

1217
01:07:40,859 --> 01:07:44,280
we knew the expression e1 of x + y if

1218
01:07:44,280 --> 01:07:46,559
I pass the values ​​of two and 3 gives me

1219
01:07:46,559 --> 01:07:49,579
one five if I generate this with one

1220
01:07:49,579 --> 01:07:53,400
randombea Well right now local time

1221
01:07:53,400 --> 01:07:55,920
Well here logically we have five

1222
01:07:55,920 --> 01:07:59,819
hours of differentiating with you because it has

1223
01:07:59,819 --> 01:08:04,380
been 20 20 with the second 20 module 18

1224
01:08:04,380 --> 01:08:07,500
would give us the second expression and for the

1225
01:08:07,500 --> 01:08:09,299
second expression what I have used has

1226
01:08:09,299 --> 01:08:11,940
been the linear expression mba polymorphic

1227
01:08:11,940 --> 01:08:14,640
I had put number 2 on it

1228
01:08:14,640 --> 01:08:17,880
returns eye This is the result as

1229
01:08:17,880 --> 01:08:22,140
whole not like a priest inteller of

1230
01:08:22,140 --> 01:08:26,819
8 bits because it returns the result 5

1231
01:08:26,819 --> 01:08:30,060
I will try in another random second

1232
01:08:30,060 --> 01:08:33,779
Well, here he has used another expression mba

1233
01:08:33,779 --> 01:08:37,560
and he gives me back 5 I also go now that he has

1234
01:08:37,560 --> 01:08:39,719
After a while expand another then here

1235
01:08:39,719 --> 01:08:42,839
use another see me another mba returns me

1236
01:08:42,839 --> 01:08:46,140
the value 5 I am going to use another one and

1237
01:08:46,140 --> 01:08:49,759
like this with each one what happens if I

1238
01:08:49,759 --> 01:08:52,080
debug this program if I had to

1239
01:08:52,080 --> 01:08:54,540
make the reversible in this program already

1240
01:08:54,540 --> 01:08:56,460
I am not faced with the complexity of a

1241
01:08:56,460 --> 01:08:59,399
only NBA I would face the

1242
01:08:59,399 --> 01:09:02,960
complexity of having to burst

1243
01:09:02,960 --> 01:09:06,899
1860 2,000 MB with which logically

1244
01:09:06,899 --> 01:09:11,100
we are going to complicate everything enough

1245
01:09:11,100 --> 01:09:13,620
we must also remember that we

1246
01:09:13,620 --> 01:09:15,899
Speaking of c, we could use

1247
01:09:15,899 --> 01:09:18,238
these opaque constants and furthermore we can

1248
01:09:18,238 --> 01:09:21,420
create different structures or is it by

1249
01:09:21,420 --> 01:09:24,359
For example, a structure where

1250
01:09:24,359 --> 01:09:27,060
will generate from here we could go

1251
01:09:27,060 --> 01:09:28,979
mounting everything that we

1252
01:09:28,979 --> 01:09:31,140
we would like

1253
01:09:31,140 --> 01:09:33,120
I have prepared a very quick demo for

1254
01:09:33,120 --> 01:09:35,759
let them see how to hide inside a

1255
01:09:35,759 --> 01:09:39,238
package of a steeler that today is not going to

1256
01:09:39,238 --> 01:09:42,000
to be, let's say, the objective of

1257
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:44,339
to check to check what would be then

1258
01:09:44,339 --> 01:09:46,799
the bypeace of the cdr of the acute in

1259
01:09:46,799 --> 01:09:49,939
behavior but that in this facker

1260
01:09:49,939 --> 01:09:53,880
what we do is to hide all

1261
01:09:53,880 --> 01:09:55,440
values ​​that interest us

1262
01:09:55,440 --> 01:09:59,759
let's generate logiders

1263
01:09:59,820 --> 01:10:02,239
if I want to process for example

1264
01:10:02,239 --> 01:10:05,580
I don't know this, well, coca-cola or good like

1265
01:10:05,580 --> 01:10:08,900
today we are today is the Day of

1266
01:10:08,900 --> 01:10:11,460
my patron saint of albacete of my land

1267
01:10:11,460 --> 01:10:13,920
natal well, for example, imagine that

1268
01:10:13,920 --> 01:10:16,080
I want to save the packer in a moment

1269
01:10:16,080 --> 01:10:19,199
determined Look for what would be by

1270
01:10:19,199 --> 01:10:21,300
example in this case well albacete in

1271
01:10:21,300 --> 01:10:23,360
exor well

1272
01:10:23,360 --> 01:10:27,719
I decompose into 8-bit values ​​this goes

1273
01:10:27,719 --> 01:10:30,420
to go from the other byte the other byte lo

1274
01:10:30,420 --> 01:10:32,219
convert to decimal generate the

1275
01:10:32,219 --> 01:10:33,840
opaque constant one is to save the

1276
01:10:33,840 --> 01:10:39,300
number 161 186 206 126 and then join

1277
01:10:39,300 --> 01:10:40,440
everything

1278
01:10:40,440 --> 01:10:44,239
come here then

1279
01:10:44,280 --> 01:10:46,739
it would generate it for me this is a generator

1280
01:10:46,739 --> 01:10:49,100
logically then

1281
01:10:49,100 --> 01:10:51,480
I looked generating the structures that I

1282
01:10:51,480 --> 01:10:54,000
I will need for this value

1283
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:55,800
would generate the necessary classes for

1284
01:10:55,800 --> 01:10:58,560
use everything I wanted and

1285
01:10:58,560 --> 01:11:01,739
for these opaque constants that we have

1286
01:11:01,739 --> 01:11:04,020
position or that we have defined Well, in this

1287
01:11:04,020 --> 01:11:06,600
case would be one another another the result

1288
01:11:06,600 --> 01:11:10,620
for example from albacete I would have it

1289
01:11:10,620 --> 01:11:12,860
So

1290
01:11:13,500 --> 01:11:16,080
and for each and every one of course not

1291
01:11:16,080 --> 01:11:18,120
to do it simply to not do it to

1292
01:11:18,120 --> 01:11:24,559
hand and now I would define the mba

1293
01:11:25,800 --> 01:11:29,420
for example with a couple of loops

1294
01:11:29,940 --> 01:11:31,800
and with a switch for the different

1295
01:11:31,800 --> 01:11:35,219
cases to simply complicate a

1296
01:11:35,219 --> 01:11:37,679
little more the code at the time of

1297
01:11:37,679 --> 01:11:40,679
to do this we would include it in the

1298
01:11:40,679 --> 01:11:44,580
steeler in that hacker and logically well

1299
01:11:44,580 --> 01:11:46,500
we could talk later in another chat

1300
01:11:46,500 --> 01:11:48,780
we could talk about behavior

1301
01:11:48,780 --> 01:11:52,140
full of cases in dinamic also not

1302
01:11:52,140 --> 01:11:53,280
forget that we will be able to do that

1303
01:11:53,280 --> 01:11:55,380
also combine with search engines

1304
01:11:55,380 --> 01:11:57,480
native code for example what would be

1305
01:11:57,480 --> 01:12:00,120
we already know the lvm but we have another

1306
01:12:00,120 --> 01:12:04,320
project that is the obfuscator ov with

1307
01:12:04,320 --> 01:12:06,239
which Well, here we have starting

1308
01:12:06,239 --> 01:12:08,760
from 12 to replace strings for

1309
01:12:08,760 --> 01:12:10,699
make code substitutions

1310
01:12:10,699 --> 01:12:13,739
control Flow platining etc.

1311
01:12:13,739 --> 01:12:17,400
etc. Also for 13 and from where

1312
01:12:17,400 --> 01:12:19,620
you can download depending on

1313
01:12:19,620 --> 01:12:21,780
example even for a visual studio

1314
01:12:21,780 --> 01:12:23,699
2022 so that they can integrate it and

1315
01:12:23,699 --> 01:12:26,100
can combine with the version of

1316
01:12:26,100 --> 01:12:29,219
frustration of the vm and pass it through

1317
01:12:29,219 --> 01:12:29,880
example

1318
01:12:29,880 --> 01:12:31,640
the set of parameters with which

1319
01:12:31,640 --> 01:12:34,800
Our goal is that when we go to

1320
01:12:34,800 --> 01:12:36,840
load that where will we be

1321
01:12:36,840 --> 01:12:39,540
Let's look at something as extremely complex as

1322
01:12:39,540 --> 01:12:41,640
this until one of sendon curses on

1323
01:12:41,640 --> 01:12:44,940
his cave or even Aida himself

1324
01:12:44,940 --> 01:12:47,100
Well, don't say what is a very

1325
01:12:47,100 --> 01:12:50,280
big logically Well we have

1326
01:12:50,280 --> 01:12:52,199
methods that is divide well you will be and

1327
01:12:52,199 --> 01:12:53,820
we could in this case address

1328
01:12:53,820 --> 01:12:57,120
It is reversible but today it is not the object of

1329
01:12:57,120 --> 01:13:01,199
the talk next step will be

1330
01:13:01,199 --> 01:13:02,940
asking how we can generate

1331
01:13:02,940 --> 01:13:06,360
different mbas that are as we have

1332
01:13:06,360 --> 01:13:09,600
seen the base for the constants then

1333
01:13:09,600 --> 01:13:11,820
without further ado we have several projects for

1334
01:13:11,820 --> 01:13:13,040
example

1335
01:13:13,040 --> 01:13:17,159
and another project that is the mma obfuscator

1336
01:13:17,159 --> 01:13:19,920
well, any of them is valid

1337
01:13:19,920 --> 01:13:21,780
and for this

1338
01:13:21,780 --> 01:13:24,600
so you can see I'm going to use

1339
01:13:24,600 --> 01:13:26,760
the second

1340
01:13:26,760 --> 01:13:29,520
for you to see this is simply

1341
01:13:29,520 --> 01:13:32,940
you would enter this address in

1342
01:13:32,940 --> 01:13:35,699
any of them there are going to have

1343
01:13:35,699 --> 01:13:38,400
all luxury of details so that they can

1344
01:13:38,400 --> 01:13:40,759
mount

1345
01:13:42,360 --> 01:13:44,060
Y

1346
01:13:44,060 --> 01:13:46,620
basically we could talk about what is

1347
01:13:46,620 --> 01:13:50,400
almost download it create a Data set or

1348
01:13:50,400 --> 01:13:53,880
use a dataset and with it then

1349
01:13:53,880 --> 01:13:56,699
be able to use

1350
01:13:56,699 --> 01:13:59,540
a generator like here in this case

1351
01:13:59,540 --> 01:14:02,219
a generator like the tetrae to be able to

1352
01:14:02,219 --> 01:14:05,820
start playing with mbas I'm going to put it

1353
01:14:05,820 --> 01:14:09,060
in operation And well, I already

1354
01:14:09,060 --> 01:14:12,500
I have generated a first mba x + y

1355
01:14:12,500 --> 01:14:16,380
I have an equivalent expression

1356
01:14:16,380 --> 01:14:21,500
first mba that is one by x despite

1357
01:14:21,500 --> 01:14:27,060
not and plus two for not etcetera etcetera

1358
01:14:27,060 --> 01:14:30,420
this right now is thinking is

1359
01:14:30,420 --> 01:14:32,940
running in real time

1360
01:14:32,940 --> 01:14:36,719
all these things you see here these

1361
01:14:36,719 --> 01:14:38,520
codes because it is so that they can be

1362
01:14:38,520 --> 01:14:41,480
perform the tests

1363
01:14:42,239 --> 01:14:44,580
and we can generate the truth tables and

1364
01:14:44,580 --> 01:14:46,800
you can do the whole process you have

1365
01:14:46,800 --> 01:14:48,719
seen before manually we can

1366
01:14:48,719 --> 01:14:50,820
arriving automating is about

1367
01:14:50,820 --> 01:14:53,360
automate it and to be able to go

1368
01:14:53,360 --> 01:14:57,420
mounting everything as I say in automatic

1369
01:14:57,420 --> 01:15:01,140
well for a while here we have thought

1370
01:15:01,140 --> 01:15:04,520
another x plus y

1371
01:15:04,620 --> 01:15:07,860
here we have another expression

1372
01:15:07,860 --> 01:15:10,520
let's wait a little longer

1373
01:15:10,520 --> 01:15:14,060
we carry I don't want either

1374
01:15:14,060 --> 01:15:16,380
use next speaker's time

1375
01:15:16,380 --> 01:15:19,020
which is very interesting. The talk that

1376
01:15:19,020 --> 01:15:22,320
comes next and you will like it

1377
01:15:22,320 --> 01:15:25,140
today and like these two days

1378
01:15:25,140 --> 01:15:27,260
past we have a congress

1379
01:15:27,260 --> 01:15:28,820
Awesome

1380
01:15:28,820 --> 01:15:31,320
I'm going to cut it due to lack of time but

1381
01:15:31,320 --> 01:15:34,800
just you would leave it and

1382
01:15:34,800 --> 01:15:36,840
little by little Here they are going to see well

1383
01:15:36,840 --> 01:15:39,480
that another expression disappears and another and

1384
01:15:39,480 --> 01:15:41,820
another and another and when the best is the

1385
01:15:41,820 --> 01:15:43,699
dataset then logically

1386
01:15:43,699 --> 01:15:49,440
better or better mbas will have Well there is

1387
01:15:49,440 --> 01:15:51,719
one question is if I can do this

1388
01:15:51,719 --> 01:15:53,820
do the investor process here

1389
01:15:53,820 --> 01:15:55,679
He was talking about this not being an encryption at all.

1390
01:15:55,679 --> 01:15:57,300
principle that this is simply

1391
01:15:57,300 --> 01:15:59,400
it was about what was a frustration and

1392
01:15:59,400 --> 01:16:01,560
we have the reverse process which is

1393
01:16:01,560 --> 01:16:03,960
unemployment and try to obtain the

1394
01:16:03,960 --> 01:16:06,540
original code or practically the

1395
01:16:06,540 --> 01:16:09,440
original code then

1396
01:16:09,440 --> 01:16:13,020
this inverse process we have a multitude of

1397
01:16:13,020 --> 01:16:16,679
papers is a very complex process,

1398
01:16:16,679 --> 01:16:17,900
I advance it

1399
01:16:17,900 --> 01:16:20,580
there is in this case for example inside

1400
01:16:20,580 --> 01:16:22,260
from the mathematical community

1401
01:16:22,260 --> 01:16:25,140
that will be cakes to see who does it

1402
01:16:25,140 --> 01:16:29,820
more effective better faster and due to

1403
01:16:29,820 --> 01:16:31,560
the complexity that it has Well, not yet

1404
01:16:31,560 --> 01:16:34,199
there is an agreement that is to say this is not so

1405
01:16:34,199 --> 01:16:36,780
easy as his generation but to give him

1406
01:16:36,780 --> 01:16:40,800
the return is much much more complex than

1407
01:16:40,800 --> 01:16:44,120
fact because it is also another person

1408
01:16:44,120 --> 01:16:46,940
pretty well known then

1409
01:16:46,940 --> 01:16:51,480
what he did well simply well say

1410
01:16:51,480 --> 01:16:53,340
Let's see if I have that original expression

1411
01:16:53,340 --> 01:16:56,219
all this is super recent Well yes

1412
01:16:56,219 --> 01:16:57,840
I have this original expression of form

1413
01:16:57,840 --> 01:17:00,659
Simplified it stays like that and

1414
01:17:00,659 --> 01:17:02,460
well, that's where it started

1415
01:17:02,460 --> 01:17:06,239
everything and also tell them that even

1416
01:17:06,239 --> 01:17:08,880
for example arnau are doing well

1417
01:17:08,880 --> 01:17:11,340
Online workshops for the topic of

1418
01:17:11,340 --> 01:17:13,500
code furcation are sometimes

1419
01:17:13,500 --> 01:17:15,120
free other times they are paid as

1420
01:17:15,120 --> 01:17:16,800
recently, for example,

1421
01:17:16,800 --> 01:17:18,020
Black Jack

1422
01:17:18,020 --> 01:17:21,420
that has just been something here you have well

1423
01:17:21,420 --> 01:17:24,300
different roles in this regard should

1424
01:17:24,300 --> 01:17:26,239
to read them and

1425
01:17:26,239 --> 01:17:30,800
calmly this with a coffee a cafetico and

1426
01:17:30,800 --> 01:17:35,100
With time and it's easy and we

1427
01:17:35,100 --> 01:17:37,560
Let's see a very practical example

1428
01:17:37,560 --> 01:17:39,480
simple but so they can understand

1429
01:17:39,480 --> 01:17:42,600
is what we will base the cases on

1430
01:17:42,600 --> 01:17:45,659
example I am going to have an expression mba

1431
01:17:45,659 --> 01:17:48,600
of this type and The question would be if I go

1432
01:17:48,600 --> 01:17:50,699
to be able to affirm if it is equivalent to a

1433
01:17:50,699 --> 01:17:53,100
simplified expression of the type that this

1434
01:17:53,100 --> 01:17:56,580
is the same as going plus like this plus x plus Z

1435
01:17:56,580 --> 01:17:59,699
of which we have used the

1436
01:17:59,699 --> 01:18:01,560
solution could be by simplification

1437
01:18:01,560 --> 01:18:04,380
algebraic can be by synthesis of

1438
01:18:04,380 --> 01:18:06,659
rotation machine learning programs

1439
01:18:06,659 --> 01:18:09,060
of mathematical or other characteristics

1440
01:18:09,060 --> 01:18:11,640
we the frameworks that we have

1441
01:18:11,640 --> 01:18:15,719
currently it is the usims and the emps in

1442
01:18:15,719 --> 01:18:19,080
In this case I am going to do it with my SIM the

1443
01:18:19,080 --> 01:18:22,159
destiny for us to see

1444
01:18:22,159 --> 01:18:25,860
let's say an effective but easy way

1445
01:18:25,860 --> 01:18:28,260
which then leaves us with professions

1446
01:18:28,260 --> 01:18:30,300
complex because we are far from the

1447
01:18:30,300 --> 01:18:33,840
hands then for us this is a

1448
01:18:33,840 --> 01:18:36,060
Simple pressure is not going to work for us

1449
01:18:36,060 --> 01:18:38,940
importing the xy or z values ​​gives me

1450
01:18:38,940 --> 01:18:42,360
the same as x is 10 the y is 20 and the z

1451
01:18:42,360 --> 01:18:45,540
be 30 as if I want it to be 20 30 40

1452
01:18:45,540 --> 01:18:49,820
50 60 and 100 would give us the same values

1453
01:18:49,820 --> 01:18:52,500
Well, it's just going to be about

1454
01:18:52,500 --> 01:18:53,760
identify the pressure part

1455
01:18:53,760 --> 01:18:55,980
complex in what we call the

1456
01:18:55,980 --> 01:18:58,920
subversion Y literally of

1457
01:18:58,920 --> 01:19:01,400
repetitive way

1458
01:19:01,400 --> 01:19:04,080
iterating we are going to replace it with

1459
01:19:04,080 --> 01:19:07,560
simple infusions because this framework

1460
01:19:07,560 --> 01:19:09,300
we are going to have two components first

1461
01:19:09,300 --> 01:19:11,940
a small database of identities

1462
01:19:11,940 --> 01:19:14,640
and a recursively algorithm that goes

1463
01:19:14,640 --> 01:19:17,280
to go through everything that would be the

1464
01:19:17,280 --> 01:19:18,900
different supermarkets

1465
01:19:18,900 --> 01:19:21,239
So what are we going to do?

1466
01:19:21,239 --> 01:19:23,820
example a lookup table

1467
01:19:23,820 --> 01:19:26,040
values ​​do not matter to us we put 10 20 and 30

1468
01:19:26,040 --> 01:19:29,820
this would be x and z, for example if I

1469
01:19:29,820 --> 01:19:33,659
I have the expression x + y since x is 10 and

1470
01:19:33,659 --> 01:19:38,940
is 20 x + and 10 plus 20 gives 30 if I have x +

1471
01:19:38,940 --> 01:19:43,380
Z well 10 + 30 will give 40 and that is my

1472
01:19:43,380 --> 01:19:49,320
table x is going to be 10 y is going to be 20 Z is going to

1473
01:19:49,320 --> 01:19:53,719
be 30 and is in the Middle Well

1474
01:19:53,719 --> 01:19:58,520
this table logically I could

1475
01:20:06,480 --> 01:20:10,159
Sorry how could I generate it then

1476
01:20:12,120 --> 01:20:14,460
calculating the values ​​and for example

1477
01:20:14,460 --> 01:20:16,620
for a first expression for a

1478
01:20:16,620 --> 01:20:18,120
second expression for a third for

1479
01:20:18,120 --> 01:20:20,239
a fourth for a fifth expression

1480
01:20:20,239 --> 01:20:23,360
defining x and z and seeing

1481
01:20:23,360 --> 01:20:26,820
these values ​​and the result if

1482
01:20:26,820 --> 01:20:28,739
equivalent

1483
01:20:28,739 --> 01:20:31,500
and could go generating with this we could

1484
01:20:31,500 --> 01:20:34,040
go generating

1485
01:20:34,199 --> 01:20:36,739
everyone

1486
01:20:38,940 --> 01:20:42,120
let's see obviously

1487
01:20:42,120 --> 01:20:44,520
that for everything it can be in some cases

1488
01:20:44,520 --> 01:20:46,739
will give 70 in another will give me 30 in another 40

1489
01:20:46,739 --> 01:20:50,340
30 40 depending on the expression or

1490
01:20:50,340 --> 01:20:52,260
superior expression that I am going to send

1491
01:20:52,260 --> 01:20:54,719
now what are we going to do we are going to derive

1492
01:20:54,719 --> 01:20:56,640
all the superpressures for example I

1493
01:20:56,640 --> 01:20:59,699
I see here a large group here I see another

1494
01:20:59,699 --> 01:21:02,159
Great group. Well, I'll try first.

1495
01:21:02,159 --> 01:21:04,800
second group break it down and

1496
01:21:04,800 --> 01:21:08,699
traversing iteratively is in the

1497
01:21:08,699 --> 01:21:10,739
original expression well I'll keep it

1498
01:21:10,739 --> 01:21:12,380
first of the groups

1499
01:21:12,380 --> 01:21:15,719
next group now from the first group

1500
01:21:15,719 --> 01:21:18,000
I check again that there is one here

1501
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:21,540
subsidy and another raises expression and of the

1502
01:21:21,540 --> 01:21:24,659
second there is another subversion 3 and another

1503
01:21:24,659 --> 01:21:28,679
super pressure 4 we are pointing them

1504
01:21:28,679 --> 01:21:30,920
all

1505
01:21:31,860 --> 01:21:34,199
until finally we can no longer

1506
01:21:34,199 --> 01:21:37,920
break it down into more grants and let's go

1507
01:21:37,920 --> 01:21:40,679
calculating for each and every one of

1508
01:21:40,679 --> 01:21:44,159
they are calculating the values

1509
01:21:44,159 --> 01:21:46,500
Well, for the first one, which is the expression

1510
01:21:46,500 --> 01:21:48,719
complete I do all the values

1511
01:21:48,719 --> 01:21:50,760
according to See here in the example the

1512
01:21:50,760 --> 01:21:53,219
result gives me 70 I look for it in my table

1513
01:21:53,219 --> 01:21:56,219
and I am not going to find logically the

1514
01:21:56,219 --> 01:21:59,400
value of 70 we continue with the following

1515
01:21:59,400 --> 01:22:02,540
raises expression was the term that had

1516
01:22:02,540 --> 01:22:05,760
on the left side I evaluate x

1517
01:22:05,760 --> 01:22:10,260
Yes and z with 10 20 and 31 I have 30 I search in

1518
01:22:10,260 --> 01:22:13,199
I find it in my table and say it was

1519
01:22:13,199 --> 01:22:15,900
equivalent to x + y Because if I add

1520
01:22:15,900 --> 01:22:20,159
given the values ​​10 20 and 30 If I add X and

1521
01:22:20,159 --> 01:22:24,380
And 10 plus 20 equals 30 Well

1522
01:22:24,380 --> 01:22:27,480
this expression that was the original if

1523
01:22:27,480 --> 01:22:29,040
realize I already have it here

1524
01:22:29,040 --> 01:22:32,340
simplified and I can use x + y plus

1525
01:22:32,340 --> 01:22:34,640
I don't know that I will have to

1526
01:22:34,640 --> 01:22:37,460
restart the algorithm but

1527
01:22:37,460 --> 01:22:40,980
this new expression that already one of his

1528
01:22:40,980 --> 01:22:42,420
terms has been logically

1529
01:22:42,420 --> 01:22:46,760
Simplified And he's younger Well now

1530
01:22:46,760 --> 01:22:49,219
given this expression

1531
01:22:49,219 --> 01:22:53,580
I would have this other one on the right of

1532
01:22:53,580 --> 01:22:56,520
here I would take out

1533
01:22:56,520 --> 01:22:59,060
other other other

1534
01:22:59,060 --> 01:23:03,739
and doing the same type

1535
01:23:04,140 --> 01:23:05,940
of operations we have done

1536
01:23:05,940 --> 01:23:08,340
above to see if I'm lucky and

1537
01:23:08,340 --> 01:23:10,020
I don't have inside my table or we don't have

1538
01:23:10,020 --> 01:23:13,320
luck and it is not in my table well

1539
01:23:13,320 --> 01:23:15,840
applying our lookup table the

1540
01:23:15,840 --> 01:23:18,659
10 20 30 we realize

1541
01:23:18,659 --> 01:23:20,340
that all this expression in a moment

1542
01:23:20,340 --> 01:23:23,280
determined was returning the value 40 like me

1543
01:23:23,280 --> 01:23:26,040
we could not be we could affirm

1544
01:23:26,040 --> 01:23:30,420
that it was x + Z and this you guys upside down

1545
01:23:30,420 --> 01:23:34,760
they can do it x pot then 10 and 30 40

1546
01:23:34,760 --> 01:23:37,380
if all this head also

1547
01:23:37,380 --> 01:23:41,400
can do da 40 is equivalent to power

1548
01:23:41,400 --> 01:23:44,659
use this expression then

1549
01:23:44,659 --> 01:23:47,280
we would simplify we would substitute Y

1550
01:23:47,280 --> 01:23:49,560
we would simplify that expression we could

1551
01:23:49,560 --> 01:23:53,640
say that it burns like this plus x plus Z is the

1552
01:23:53,640 --> 01:23:56,880
equivalent of that expression

1553
01:23:56,880 --> 01:23:59,580
complex we restart we get again

1554
01:23:59,580 --> 01:24:03,719
60 and therefore we already yes that

1555
01:24:03,719 --> 01:24:06,900
we could confirm that this is the way

1556
01:24:06,900 --> 01:24:10,020
of society and from there we can no longer

1557
01:24:10,020 --> 01:24:13,500
get no more trouble with

1558
01:24:13,500 --> 01:24:16,440
very few results Well, within

1559
01:24:16,440 --> 01:24:18,659
what would be the we employ is not going to be

1560
01:24:18,659 --> 01:24:20,460
precise we have to have a dataset

1561
01:24:20,460 --> 01:24:23,940
quite complex and aside it would be a

1562
01:24:23,940 --> 01:24:26,219
error For example, consult values ​​of the

1563
01:24:26,219 --> 01:24:29,640
type 2 and 2 because for example given

1564
01:24:29,640 --> 01:24:32,820
values ​​2 and 2 that will return 4 because x

1565
01:24:32,820 --> 01:24:37,400
+ y returns 4 x + x also out of 44

1566
01:24:37,400 --> 01:24:40,140
with which we must play with that series

1567
01:24:40,140 --> 01:24:44,420
of values ​​But this let's say that

1568
01:24:44,420 --> 01:24:47,060
growing the Data set today we have

1569
01:24:47,060 --> 01:24:49,500
computational time We also have

1570
01:24:49,500 --> 01:24:52,320
plenty of space in what would be cloud Y

1571
01:24:52,320 --> 01:24:55,020
we have very good values

1572
01:24:55,020 --> 01:24:57,719
we could go up and aside the traffic

1573
01:24:57,719 --> 01:24:59,280
we should use numbers when

1574
01:24:59,280 --> 01:25:01,739
higher much better for everything

1575
01:25:01,739 --> 01:25:04,020
we would be that couple that we are going to use

1576
01:25:04,020 --> 01:25:07,800
but the higher the number the more it will

1577
01:25:07,800 --> 01:25:10,020
logically slow down the calculations and

1578
01:25:10,020 --> 01:25:11,880
apart first that there are operations to

1579
01:25:11,880 --> 01:25:13,800
bit level if I'm in a space of

1580
01:25:13,800 --> 01:25:17,400
64 bits Well, maybe those 32 bits that

1581
01:25:17,400 --> 01:25:20,280
I have in the part of the msb or msb A lo

1582
01:25:20,280 --> 01:25:21,260
better

1583
01:25:21,260 --> 01:25:24,480
doing casting okay that is without

1584
01:25:24,480 --> 01:25:26,219
make casting I could give the same

1585
01:25:26,219 --> 01:25:29,340
when we talk about lossless rotation

1586
01:25:29,340 --> 01:25:31,140
significantly with which we must

1587
01:25:31,140 --> 01:25:33,719
always use that Castle in the

1588
01:25:33,719 --> 01:25:35,219
counting tables

1589
01:25:35,219 --> 01:25:37,860
well how could we solve with m5

1590
01:25:37,860 --> 01:25:40,820
Well with m6 simply

1591
01:25:40,820 --> 01:25:44,159
we would create the expression and ask

1592
01:25:44,159 --> 01:25:47,280
that it was here in this case that it was

1593
01:25:47,280 --> 01:25:50,120
resolved for it

1594
01:25:50,120 --> 01:25:55,280
So we have created an example

1595
01:25:58,679 --> 01:26:02,480
This example where I simply Well

1596
01:26:02,480 --> 01:26:04,920
this was the expression we had

1597
01:26:04,920 --> 01:26:06,179
employee

1598
01:26:06,179 --> 01:26:09,300
Well, we are going to return it has its own

1599
01:26:09,300 --> 01:26:10,679
synthesis I no longer have time to

1600
01:26:10,679 --> 01:26:14,100
to explain it I'm going to tell you where

1601
01:26:14,100 --> 01:26:15,600
I have here in this case well it comes with

1602
01:26:15,600 --> 01:26:17,340
a minimal sample database but

1603
01:26:17,340 --> 01:26:20,340
It is also recommended to download a

1604
01:26:20,340 --> 01:26:24,860
which are only 31 gigabytes 25 31 GB

1605
01:26:24,860 --> 01:26:30,000
Nor is it so much today and where to

1606
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:33,719
32 bits let's try to test

1607
01:26:33,719 --> 01:26:37,040
this result

1608
01:26:40,320 --> 01:26:43,080
you are going to see that

1609
01:26:43,080 --> 01:26:46,620
This is not easy for the case that we

1610
01:26:46,620 --> 01:26:49,040
logically it will be corrective

1611
01:26:49,040 --> 01:26:52,320
but when we play with people very

1612
01:26:52,320 --> 01:26:54,960
long I particularly because I have

1613
01:26:54,960 --> 01:26:56,360
tried

1614
01:26:56,360 --> 01:26:57,920
both of them

1615
01:26:57,920 --> 01:27:00,239
with they have given Well I have also had

1616
01:27:00,239 --> 01:27:02,940
many conversations about it and with

1617
01:27:02,940 --> 01:27:05,400
other people very involved in the world

1618
01:27:05,400 --> 01:27:09,179
mathematician And unfortunately that is

1619
01:27:09,179 --> 01:27:12,840
many things today to do with what

1620
01:27:12,840 --> 01:27:15,739
which one are we going to have here

1621
01:27:15,739 --> 01:27:17,360
pretty

1622
01:27:17,360 --> 01:27:22,320
a lot of work, see how long it takes

1623
01:27:22,320 --> 01:27:24,860
they want to move forward

1624
01:27:24,860 --> 01:27:28,020
Well, this was the original and if everything

1625
01:27:28,020 --> 01:27:30,179
it was correct that this should be the

1626
01:27:30,179 --> 01:27:33,060
simplified result and even still

1627
01:27:33,060 --> 01:27:36,179
Well, much more optimized if it is

1628
01:27:36,179 --> 01:27:38,940
logically if he is able to

1629
01:27:38,940 --> 01:27:40,620
solve it if you were not able to

1630
01:27:40,620 --> 01:27:42,420
solve it because we don't have the

1631
01:27:42,420 --> 01:27:44,340
enough set then logically

1632
01:27:44,340 --> 01:27:46,440
this would be precomputing precomputing

1633
01:27:46,440 --> 01:27:49,280
precomputing and

1634
01:27:49,280 --> 01:27:53,179
it would take too long

1635
01:27:53,480 --> 01:27:56,460
Suppose to obtain a simplification

1636
01:27:56,460 --> 01:27:59,340
of this NBA would not be a problem

1637
01:27:59,340 --> 01:28:01,500
Although it seems complex that is what

1638
01:28:01,500 --> 01:28:02,760
we would write in code but then

1639
01:28:02,760 --> 01:28:05,280
finally it would be something like

1640
01:28:05,280 --> 01:28:07,920
extremely simple like this

1641
01:28:07,920 --> 01:28:10,560
and Before seeing the conclusions come

1642
01:28:10,560 --> 01:28:13,380
we have been lucky we have been lucky

1643
01:28:13,380 --> 01:28:17,159
Well, here we are seeing his expression

1644
01:28:17,159 --> 01:28:21,239
original and simplified expression

1645
01:28:21,239 --> 01:28:24,199
well this even with

1646
01:28:24,199 --> 01:28:26,639
I say it because we can play about

1647
01:28:26,639 --> 01:28:30,120
binaries to solve binaries in this

1648
01:28:30,120 --> 01:28:31,860
case of both linens and Windows

1649
01:28:31,860 --> 01:28:36,000
or sx we can play to solve certain

1650
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:39,380
expressions and also combining it Well

1651
01:28:39,380 --> 01:28:42,900
with little plugins or harvest stuff

1652
01:28:42,900 --> 01:28:45,600
proper and good as conclusions Well

1653
01:28:45,600 --> 01:28:48,480
when they have to avoid something or hide

1654
01:28:48,480 --> 01:28:50,940
something that not only look for code of

1655
01:28:50,940 --> 01:28:53,460
chains are worth anything let's look from

1656
01:28:53,460 --> 01:28:54,960
now any type of operation that

1657
01:28:54,960 --> 01:28:58,620
it is likely that we use 8/16 32 or

1658
01:28:58,620 --> 01:29:00,840
64 bits depending on the values ​​you

1659
01:29:00,840 --> 01:29:03,360
we have to save we have to remember

1660
01:29:03,360 --> 01:29:06,179
Also that there are other expressions like

1661
01:29:06,179 --> 01:29:12,620
the subtraction and the subtraction is more less then

1662
01:29:12,620 --> 01:29:15,780
for example the multiplication we can

1663
01:29:15,780 --> 01:29:18,780
do it by successive sums

1664
01:29:18,780 --> 01:29:21,179
etcetera etcetera and

1665
01:29:21,179 --> 01:29:23,100
let's talk about upcoming optimizations

1666
01:29:23,100 --> 01:29:25,560
in the compilers logically

1667
01:29:25,560 --> 01:29:27,360
uses an optimization to try

1668
01:29:27,360 --> 01:29:29,820
the compiler get the expression else

1669
01:29:29,820 --> 01:29:31,380
short whereby the shortest expression

1670
01:29:31,380 --> 01:29:34,800
many times it is not the most correct and that

1671
01:29:34,800 --> 01:29:37,139
It will present us with a lot of complexity.

1672
01:29:37,139 --> 01:29:40,100
as to what would be

1673
01:29:40,100 --> 01:29:43,020
unemployment and with this we will have

1674
01:29:43,020 --> 01:29:46,860
Got to have this 101 and I don't know if

1675
01:29:46,860 --> 01:29:50,580
There will then be a small margin for the

1676
01:29:50,580 --> 01:29:52,400
questions

1677
01:29:52,400 --> 01:29:54,780
but thank you very much for your participation

1678
01:29:54,780 --> 01:29:57,900
the truth is that you always enlighten us

1679
01:29:57,900 --> 01:30:00,659
against these strange things that you

1680
01:30:00,659 --> 01:30:03,060
occur to do bypasses and to do

1681
01:30:03,060 --> 01:30:05,699
justification are obviously things that

1682
01:30:05,699 --> 01:30:08,159
we must know then in order to be able

1683
01:30:08,159 --> 01:30:10,020
return our work properly and

1684
01:30:10,020 --> 01:30:11,159
skip all these measures of

1685
01:30:11,159 --> 01:30:15,120
security that we say obfuscate or

1686
01:30:15,120 --> 01:30:16,820
get in the way of our day-to-day work

1687
01:30:16,820 --> 01:30:18,840
indeed we have some questions

1688
01:30:18,840 --> 01:30:22,080
They are quite a lot but we are going to reduce it to

1689
01:30:22,080 --> 01:30:24,719
two so as not to consume a lot of time

1690
01:30:24,719 --> 01:30:28,639
it seems to me it seems to me

1691
01:30:28,639 --> 01:30:31,920
well wait there are some that have

1692
01:30:31,920 --> 01:30:36,739
Well let's go with the most Likes

1693
01:30:37,219 --> 01:30:40,199
in reverse for the sake of simplicity No

1694
01:30:40,199 --> 01:30:42,060
one could simply translate the

1695
01:30:42,060 --> 01:30:45,480
assembler does everything and those many

1696
01:30:45,480 --> 01:30:47,159
operations independent of what

1697
01:30:47,159 --> 01:30:48,420
out

1698
01:30:48,420 --> 01:30:51,179
Yes but when the expression in C is a

1699
01:30:51,179 --> 01:30:53,960
expression thus we have the same

1700
01:30:53,960 --> 01:30:57,300
it's very complex huh

1701
01:30:57,300 --> 01:30:59,239
Not that

1702
01:30:59,239 --> 01:31:01,820
Well

1703
01:31:01,820 --> 01:31:03,900
I recommend that you try

1704
01:31:03,900 --> 01:31:06,600
try you have to validate as they say by

1705
01:31:06,600 --> 01:31:08,480
there

1706
01:31:08,480 --> 01:31:12,480
to port you this type of code

1707
01:31:12,480 --> 01:31:16,980
something like c python or

1708
01:31:16,980 --> 01:31:21,440
only low level as I know not also

1709
01:31:21,440 --> 01:31:26,940
what you like I am to see I know

1710
01:31:26,940 --> 01:31:29,400
says Plus because they are big myths

1711
01:31:29,400 --> 01:31:32,040
favorites logically and then poison

1712
01:31:32,040 --> 01:31:35,400
but it doesn't matter there are the good things that I

1713
01:31:35,400 --> 01:31:37,560
allow is the glass very fast and

1714
01:31:37,560 --> 01:31:39,780
apart in paisón the solvers that we have

1715
01:31:39,780 --> 01:31:42,239
especially the z3 solver I say it

1716
01:31:42,239 --> 01:31:45,380
because it is a wonderful solver and

1717
01:31:45,380 --> 01:31:50,300
it goes very well very fast and very effective

1718
01:31:56,060 --> 01:31:59,699
It seems I say it because not to not

1719
01:31:59,699 --> 01:32:01,400
eat the time of the next speaker

1720
01:32:01,400 --> 01:32:06,080
any as we are going to publish them and

1721
01:32:06,080 --> 01:32:08,699
they have us online you can go

1722
01:32:08,699 --> 01:32:13,500
asking and we answer them ok

1723
01:32:13,500 --> 01:32:16,820
done, no problem

1724
01:32:19,860 --> 01:32:21,560
Dale I'll send you the questions

1725
01:32:21,560 --> 01:32:24,060
missing so that I can answer them in

1726
01:32:24,060 --> 01:32:26,100
your social networks at this moment in the

1727
01:32:26,100 --> 01:32:27,540
chat are sending social networks

1728
01:32:27,540 --> 01:32:30,420
of Pedro and then I leave the public to you

1729
01:32:30,420 --> 01:32:34,199
that you say goodbye perfectly Well, I for myself

1730
01:32:34,199 --> 01:32:36,840
part then thank you above all

1731
01:32:36,840 --> 01:32:40,620
It looks like Jaime Andrés to Pablo to you

1732
01:32:40,620 --> 01:32:43,920
Jacobo to the husbands to the stickers for

1733
01:32:43,920 --> 01:32:45,960
course to all participants

1734
01:32:45,960 --> 01:32:48,300
are here with us today and these days

1735
01:32:48,300 --> 01:32:50,639
and logically Well, to the great community

1736
01:32:50,639 --> 01:32:54,600
Dragon yard security and see you

1737
01:32:54,600 --> 01:32:57,719
shortly and in November then comment

1738
01:32:57,719 --> 01:33:00,120
that if they are in Bogotá, then over there

1739
01:33:00,120 --> 01:33:03,300
we will be in other events Many

1740
01:33:03,300 --> 01:33:05,639
thanks we will send that information

1741
01:33:05,639 --> 01:33:07,500
also through the chat so that I don't know

1742
01:33:07,500 --> 01:33:09,960
lose, let's continue with our

1743
01:33:09,960 --> 01:33:11,820
schedule below from Mexico

1744
01:33:11,820 --> 01:33:15,360
we have Sergio Rueda he has found

1745
01:33:15,360 --> 01:33:16,980
some security issues

1746
01:33:16,980 --> 01:33:19,199
some mass transit systems

1747
01:33:19,199 --> 01:33:21,600
Mexico from Colombia and we are going to speak a

1748
01:33:21,600 --> 01:33:24,600
little about these findings Sergio are you

1749
01:33:24,600 --> 01:33:26,960
right there

1750
01:33:28,580 --> 01:33:31,860
We listened to Sergio the public then

1751
01:33:31,860 --> 01:33:34,860
so that it illustrates what you have for

1752
01:33:34,860 --> 01:33:36,620
show us today

1753
01:33:36,620 --> 01:33:39,420
second we are going to play the presentation and

1754
01:33:39,420 --> 01:33:41,300
I share the screen

1755
01:33:41,300 --> 01:33:45,600
Meanwhile remember on the networks

1756
01:33:45,600 --> 01:33:46,980
social of the stickers because they

1757
01:33:46,980 --> 01:33:48,600
thank you very much for giving them your

1758
01:33:48,600 --> 01:33:51,120
comments about what they talked about in

1759
01:33:51,120 --> 01:33:53,400
the chat. They are usually getting

1760
01:33:53,400 --> 01:33:55,320
the social networks of each clicker that

1761
01:33:55,320 --> 01:33:56,880
I'm talking but on the official page

1762
01:33:56,880 --> 01:33:59,699
from the golden event hardcore.org Well there

1763
01:33:59,699 --> 01:34:00,900
they will also find the networks

1764
01:34:00,900 --> 01:34:03,120
So I leave you with Sergio

1765
01:34:03,120 --> 01:34:06,420
Rueda Sergio ready there you can see it

1766
01:34:06,420 --> 01:34:08,659
the screen

1767
01:34:10,340 --> 01:34:12,780
ready Perfect then the talk of the

1768
01:34:12,780 --> 01:34:14,520
today well first I thank you

1769
01:34:14,520 --> 01:34:16,679
welcome everyone let's talk then

1770
01:34:16,679 --> 01:34:19,139
some of the security issues in the

1771
01:34:19,139 --> 01:34:20,820
contactless payment systems

1772
01:34:20,820 --> 01:34:23,460
specific and therefore associated with the topic of

1773
01:34:23,460 --> 01:34:24,980
transportation systems then

1774
01:34:24,980 --> 01:34:26,940
we were working with some

1775
01:34:26,940 --> 01:34:28,199
transportation systems in both Mexico

1776
01:34:28,199 --> 01:34:30,300
like from Colombia so let's go

1777
01:34:30,300 --> 01:34:31,980
see part of the findings and all

1778
01:34:31,980 --> 01:34:33,960
this that we were working on

1779
01:34:33,960 --> 01:34:36,120
methodology tools such as

1780
01:34:36,120 --> 01:34:37,440
we did that we found that we can

1781
01:34:37,440 --> 01:34:40,880
to do and then some suddenly

1782
01:34:40,880 --> 01:34:43,020
solutions or recommendations for

1783
01:34:43,020 --> 01:34:45,179
this is not so easy no

1784
01:34:45,179 --> 01:34:47,699
so a little bit of who am i for

1785
01:34:47,699 --> 01:34:49,260
those who don't know me my name is

1786
01:34:49,260 --> 01:34:51,480
Sergio Rueda I am Colombian I live in Mexico

1787
01:34:51,480 --> 01:34:54,060
I have been living here for five years.

1788
01:34:54,060 --> 01:34:55,139
college systems engineer

1789
01:34:55,139 --> 01:34:56,659
Colombian Cooperative

1790
01:34:56,659 --> 01:34:58,920
I was doing a master's degree at the top

1791
01:34:58,920 --> 01:35:00,139
Culhuacán here in Mexico City

1792
01:35:00,139 --> 01:35:03,300
while the master's degree, well, I was in a

1793
01:35:03,300 --> 01:35:05,040
research stay in Tokyo in

1794
01:35:05,040 --> 01:35:06,920
Japan security lab

1795
01:35:06,920 --> 01:35:09,540
I currently design myself as an Architect of

1796
01:35:09,540 --> 01:35:11,340
security in digital press for the

1797
01:35:11,340 --> 01:35:14,940
femsa group here in Mexico and in my data

1798
01:35:14,940 --> 01:35:16,800
free because he gives some classes there in the

1799
01:35:16,800 --> 01:35:18,480
Military School of Engineers and the

1800
01:35:18,480 --> 01:35:20,699
Pan American University the line

1801
01:35:20,699 --> 01:35:22,620
research that I carry that I work

1802
01:35:22,620 --> 01:35:24,659
that I have some knowledge or

1803
01:35:24,659 --> 01:35:26,760
experience is all about

1804
01:35:26,760 --> 01:35:29,159
security in rfid that what we are going to see

1805
01:35:29,159 --> 01:35:31,139
today the administration part

1806
01:35:31,139 --> 01:35:34,500
and security management architecture

1807
01:35:34,500 --> 01:35:37,440
security and security class then this

1808
01:35:37,440 --> 01:35:39,179
more or less is what I wear

1809
01:35:39,179 --> 01:35:41,719
working and there I leave my linkedin Y

1810
01:35:41,719 --> 01:35:44,219
you so that they can suddenly continue

1811
01:35:44,219 --> 01:35:46,100
or ask any questions you have

1812
01:35:46,100 --> 01:35:50,699
first Well, before going to what

1813
01:35:50,699 --> 01:35:53,100
we are interested in two small disclainers

1814
01:35:53,100 --> 01:35:54,600
first any resemblance to the

1815
01:35:54,600 --> 01:35:56,699
reality is pure coincidence not here

1816
01:35:56,699 --> 01:35:59,060
let's see soon

1817
01:35:59,060 --> 01:36:01,520
pictures or

1818
01:36:01,520 --> 01:36:03,659
topics that can be associated with

1819
01:36:03,659 --> 01:36:05,100
different transport but here the idea

1820
01:36:05,100 --> 01:36:06,500
It is not

1821
01:36:06,500 --> 01:36:09,360
put in bad for each of the

1822
01:36:09,360 --> 01:36:10,340
transportation but on the contrary

1823
01:36:10,340 --> 01:36:12,600
Show weaknesses

1824
01:36:12,600 --> 01:36:13,739
vulnerabilities that can present

1825
01:36:13,739 --> 01:36:16,500
true So if it seems similar to them

1826
01:36:16,500 --> 01:36:20,360
this card or this system

1827
01:36:20,360 --> 01:36:23,040
let's leave it there as an incognito so as not to

1828
01:36:23,040 --> 01:36:26,219
No, don't burn it, it's easy, not the second time.

1829
01:36:26,219 --> 01:36:28,080
Well, all the tests were done with

1830
01:36:28,080 --> 01:36:29,900
purely academic purposes

1831
01:36:29,900 --> 01:36:33,900
this Well, in order to make visible

1832
01:36:33,900 --> 01:36:36,000
this vulnerabilities to companies more

1833
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:37,560
not to get any profit

1834
01:36:37,560 --> 01:36:39,719
because we know that he has this

1835
01:36:39,719 --> 01:36:41,760
safety the line that divides us from what

1836
01:36:41,760 --> 01:36:43,440
what is legal what is illegal what

1837
01:36:43,440 --> 01:36:45,060
what is unethical is ethical because it is very

1838
01:36:45,060 --> 01:36:46,920
small but the idea of ​​these

1839
01:36:46,920 --> 01:36:49,440
investigations, well, I tell you, it is in favor of

1840
01:36:49,440 --> 01:36:50,820
security for companies

1841
01:36:50,820 --> 01:36:52,920
they can have their systems a little more

1842
01:36:52,920 --> 01:36:56,400
sure then starting a little and

1843
01:36:56,400 --> 01:36:58,500
approaching the theme suddenly

1844
01:36:58,500 --> 01:37:01,560
they don't know what nfc is then

1845
01:37:01,560 --> 01:37:03,300
radio frequency identification

1846
01:37:03,300 --> 01:37:05,480
corresponds to

1847
01:37:05,480 --> 01:37:07,320
a technology that allows us

1848
01:37:07,320 --> 01:37:10,980
identifies by means of waves

1849
01:37:10,980 --> 01:37:13,620
stations no then there is a reader there

1850
01:37:13,620 --> 01:37:15,840
a card there is a system that is

1851
01:37:15,840 --> 01:37:17,760
validating that you are getting

1852
01:37:17,760 --> 01:37:19,860
information on these cards to make

1853
01:37:19,860 --> 01:37:21,840
a validation even the

1854
01:37:21,840 --> 01:37:22,920
radiofrequency we are going to see it now

1855
01:37:22,920 --> 01:37:25,400
not only are these cards that

1856
01:37:25,400 --> 01:37:27,719
we can find ourselves in many

1857
01:37:27,719 --> 01:37:30,600
systems currently but goes beyond

1858
01:37:30,600 --> 01:37:31,739
everything that has to do with him

1859
01:37:31,739 --> 01:37:34,199
electromagnetic spectrum as such ready

1860
01:37:34,199 --> 01:37:36,540
then within the radio frequency

1861
01:37:36,540 --> 01:37:38,820
we find something that is the npc that is the

1862
01:37:38,820 --> 01:37:40,880
near field communication really

1863
01:37:40,880 --> 01:37:43,739
we see this communication today

1864
01:37:43,739 --> 01:37:46,199
a lot on cell phones a lot

1865
01:37:46,199 --> 01:37:47,699
sometimes people don't even

1866
01:37:47,699 --> 01:37:49,920
we knew that this could come to pass

1867
01:37:49,920 --> 01:37:52,260
exist but it is being used very

1868
01:37:52,260 --> 01:37:54,239
big especially right now in systems

1869
01:37:54,239 --> 01:37:56,040
banks where almost the majority of

1870
01:37:56,040 --> 01:37:58,440
cards already have an nfc system in

1871
01:37:58,440 --> 01:38:00,900
where they allow me to make a payment without ni

1872
01:38:00,900 --> 01:38:04,080
even put my chip or put a one

1873
01:38:04,080 --> 01:38:05,940
key or an IP or a password no

1874
01:38:05,940 --> 01:38:08,219
So this communication

1875
01:38:08,219 --> 01:38:10,860
that are booming or nowadays both in

1876
01:38:10,860 --> 01:38:14,520
Colombia as in Mexico and well, it has

1877
01:38:14,520 --> 01:38:16,139
I have been using many systems such as

1878
01:38:16,139 --> 01:38:18,840
For example, access to buildings such as

1879
01:38:18,840 --> 01:38:21,840
access to certain systems

1880
01:38:21,840 --> 01:38:24,480
transport to events and much more than

1881
01:38:24,480 --> 01:38:26,940
let's see later So yes

1882
01:38:26,940 --> 01:38:28,500
we compare a little what the npc is with

1883
01:38:28,500 --> 01:38:30,600
the rpim let's see what he repeats

1884
01:38:30,600 --> 01:38:32,100
includes many technologies that we are

1885
01:38:32,100 --> 01:38:34,860
using us currently Yes by

1886
01:38:34,860 --> 01:38:36,480
example wireless internet

1887
01:38:36,480 --> 01:38:37,800
our houses cellular communication

1888
01:38:37,800 --> 01:38:40,080
bluetooth and any others

1889
01:38:40,080 --> 01:38:42,780
technologies that we can have so

1890
01:38:42,780 --> 01:38:45,480
wireless Yes at the end these

1891
01:38:45,480 --> 01:38:47,699
radiofrequency in the end we use this

1892
01:38:47,699 --> 01:38:48,620
us

1893
01:38:48,620 --> 01:38:51,420
honest not to be if we are or we are not

1894
01:38:51,420 --> 01:38:53,460
technology or security experts

1895
01:38:53,460 --> 01:38:55,980
Well, we are using it daily, no, and

1896
01:38:55,980 --> 01:38:58,920
within this category because it includes

1897
01:38:58,920 --> 01:39:01,080
the npc really the difference between the

1898
01:39:01,080 --> 01:39:04,679
npc and the Diff is the operating band of

1899
01:39:04,679 --> 01:39:06,600
frequencies where they operate not the npc

1900
01:39:06,600 --> 01:39:10,280
Operates on certain very limited and also

1901
01:39:10,280 --> 01:39:12,840
Another issue is the distances in which I

1902
01:39:12,840 --> 01:39:15,840
can i read these labels or are you

1903
01:39:15,840 --> 01:39:18,120
cards put the PC not normally

1904
01:39:18,120 --> 01:39:20,520
It has been between five or ten

1905
01:39:20,520 --> 01:39:22,260
centimeters away what I

1906
01:39:22,260 --> 01:39:24,840
allows or what requires me to be

1907
01:39:24,840 --> 01:39:27,480
close to the reader to be able to make the

1908
01:39:27,480 --> 01:39:29,040
reading no We also obviously have

1909
01:39:29,040 --> 01:39:31,800
many radio frequency issues that yes

1910
01:39:31,800 --> 01:39:34,260
WiFi is long-range

1911
01:39:34,260 --> 01:39:35,460
example, we have to make a

1912
01:39:35,460 --> 01:39:37,500
coverage of a house of an office

1913
01:39:37,500 --> 01:39:40,020
and cellular networks, which is one of the most

1914
01:39:40,020 --> 01:39:42,120
large that we can use

1915
01:39:42,120 --> 01:39:44,820
daily then where we find

1916
01:39:44,820 --> 01:39:46,460
us

1917
01:39:46,460 --> 01:39:49,620
npc systems nowadays the system

1918
01:39:49,620 --> 01:39:50,659
ID

1919
01:39:50,659 --> 01:39:53,760
the passports the new ID

1920
01:39:53,760 --> 01:39:55,679
virtual that are taking out these cards

1921
01:39:55,679 --> 01:39:57,920
that Colombia has today that is

1922
01:39:57,920 --> 01:39:59,880
promoting that people have to

1923
01:39:59,880 --> 01:40:01,800
change their normal cells for the

1924
01:40:01,800 --> 01:40:04,080
normal cells this come from PC Good

1925
01:40:04,080 --> 01:40:06,320
there is also physical access physical

1926
01:40:06,320 --> 01:40:09,000
we have offices we have

1927
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:11,639
movie theater parking lots

1928
01:40:11,639 --> 01:40:14,159
amusement parks many places

1929
01:40:14,159 --> 01:40:16,080
more where we can access us with

1930
01:40:16,080 --> 01:40:18,540
We don't have those distribution systems

1931
01:40:18,540 --> 01:40:20,280
transport systems we have systems

1932
01:40:20,280 --> 01:40:23,280
bank payment we have tickets Y

1933
01:40:23,280 --> 01:40:25,400
we have much more no then

1934
01:40:25,400 --> 01:40:28,500
I told them about the rise of these systems to

1935
01:40:28,500 --> 01:40:31,020
commercial level is very big right now

1936
01:40:31,020 --> 01:40:31,679
is doing a lot

1937
01:40:31,679 --> 01:40:34,199
implementations in different environments

1938
01:40:34,199 --> 01:40:37,139
that allow an ease obviously

1939
01:40:37,139 --> 01:40:39,000
because I no longer have to have one

1940
01:40:39,000 --> 01:40:40,980
direct interaction with a device

1941
01:40:40,980 --> 01:40:43,020
to make a payment but with a

1942
01:40:43,020 --> 01:40:45,360
proximity that he comes to have

1943
01:40:45,360 --> 01:40:48,360
reader, I can now apply well, be it

1944
01:40:48,360 --> 01:40:50,880
access or purchase or whatever we want

1945
01:40:50,880 --> 01:40:53,520
do no So if we focus now

1946
01:40:53,520 --> 01:40:55,460
for in the security part

1947
01:40:55,460 --> 01:40:58,199
we can find different weaknesses

1948
01:40:58,199 --> 01:41:00,179
or different put skills Yes

1949
01:41:00,179 --> 01:41:03,060
then Those weaknesses in in

1950
01:41:03,060 --> 01:41:06,000
directly the system on the PC can

1951
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:08,040
be associated in three in three large

1952
01:41:08,040 --> 01:41:11,219
not the associated part of the tags or the

1953
01:41:11,219 --> 01:41:12,900
labels or cards such as

1954
01:41:12,900 --> 01:41:16,620
Let's know if they can be present

1955
01:41:16,620 --> 01:41:18,540
in the authentication processes and

1956
01:41:18,540 --> 01:41:20,580
decryption algorithms have this

1957
01:41:20,580 --> 01:41:22,860
vulnerabilities that make a

1958
01:41:22,860 --> 01:41:25,080
attacker could end up compromising the

1959
01:41:25,080 --> 01:41:27,060
labels directly not now Also

1960
01:41:27,060 --> 01:41:28,679
we have some weaknesses in the channels

1961
01:41:28,679 --> 01:41:32,100
of communication that allow me to do

1962
01:41:32,100 --> 01:41:34,199
attacks for example of average man or

1963
01:41:34,199 --> 01:41:36,060
listening attacks where I can

1964
01:41:36,060 --> 01:41:38,460
intervene in communication between

1965
01:41:38,460 --> 01:41:39,780
reader and a card and get

1966
01:41:39,780 --> 01:41:42,780
information I can't just get it

1967
01:41:42,780 --> 01:41:44,580
I can modify it I can replicate it now

1968
01:41:44,580 --> 01:41:46,500
there are different attacks that we will be

1969
01:41:46,500 --> 01:41:49,500
speaking later and there are weaknesses

1970
01:41:49,500 --> 01:41:51,600
in the readers then The reader who

1971
01:41:51,600 --> 01:41:53,600
Does the system have Genuine readers

1972
01:41:53,600 --> 01:41:56,580
have some vulnerabilities that

1973
01:41:56,580 --> 01:41:58,739
allow a direct impact on

1974
01:41:58,739 --> 01:42:00,679
what would be the availability then

1975
01:42:00,679 --> 01:42:02,880
can i do a denial attack

1976
01:42:02,880 --> 01:42:06,239
service towards a system of voters

1977
01:42:06,239 --> 01:42:10,199
of a payment system of not and apart from

1978
01:42:10,199 --> 01:42:12,440
this crosswise

1979
01:42:12,440 --> 01:42:16,080
there are external applications that do

1980
01:42:16,080 --> 01:42:18,719
use of these tags Then by

1981
01:42:18,719 --> 01:42:21,420
example if I have a mobile application yes

1982
01:42:21,420 --> 01:42:23,460
I have a system a cow a problem

1983
01:42:23,460 --> 01:42:26,760
where I can drive or interact

1984
01:42:26,760 --> 01:42:29,000
with the cards then

1985
01:42:29,000 --> 01:42:31,739
there I will be able to have other fields of

1986
01:42:31,739 --> 01:42:33,679
action at security level no

1987
01:42:33,679 --> 01:42:37,080
data delivery vulnerabilities

1988
01:42:37,080 --> 01:42:39,420
the communication channels of the time

1989
01:42:39,420 --> 01:42:41,100
robust security Well there we go

1990
01:42:41,100 --> 01:42:43,199
see a little later no So

1991
01:42:43,199 --> 01:42:45,000
some of the attacks that can be

1992
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:49,199
obtain in these types of analysis of

1993
01:42:49,199 --> 01:42:51,360
security is the attack listen where

1994
01:42:51,360 --> 01:42:53,820
I can intervene the channel I have

1995
01:42:53,820 --> 01:42:55,980
access to a Genuine reader or a

1996
01:42:55,980 --> 01:42:57,380
genuine label

1997
01:42:57,380 --> 01:42:59,760
captured the entire packet being o

1998
01:42:59,760 --> 01:43:01,440
all the plot that is being shared

1999
01:43:01,440 --> 01:43:03,900
between them and you can get

2000
01:43:03,900 --> 01:43:05,540
certain information that allows me

2001
01:43:05,540 --> 01:43:07,920
analyze or generate

2002
01:43:07,920 --> 01:43:10,199
some attack vectors We also have

2003
01:43:10,199 --> 01:43:13,699
the middle man attack where well

2004
01:43:13,699 --> 01:43:16,320
similar to the previous attack we

2005
01:43:16,320 --> 01:43:20,699
we can not just get but modify OR

2006
01:43:20,699 --> 01:43:22,980
replicate the information so that I

2007
01:43:22,980 --> 01:43:25,560
may affect the operation somewhat

2008
01:43:25,560 --> 01:43:28,739
or alter the normal functioning of the

2009
01:43:28,739 --> 01:43:31,159
what do you have?

2010
01:43:31,159 --> 01:43:33,719
we are tag spoofing attacks on

2011
01:43:33,719 --> 01:43:35,360
where i go to

2012
01:43:35,360 --> 01:43:38,520
impersonate a genuine card i go for

2013
01:43:38,520 --> 01:43:39,960
through a card like the one we see

2014
01:43:39,960 --> 01:43:42,440
in the image that are cards

2015
01:43:42,440 --> 01:43:45,480
many times Chinese obviously where

2016
01:43:45,480 --> 01:43:47,280
I can write the information of a

2017
01:43:47,280 --> 01:43:49,380
of a genuine card and I can

2018
01:43:49,380 --> 01:43:51,119
impersonate it to the real system Yes

2019
01:43:51,119 --> 01:43:53,460
Now it also allows me to do attacks

2020
01:43:53,460 --> 01:43:55,440
cloning where I can take the

2021
01:43:55,440 --> 01:43:57,960
100% of my card information and

2022
01:43:57,960 --> 01:43:59,580
I can save it on a card in

2023
01:43:59,580 --> 01:44:02,340
white to also do the same and

2024
01:44:02,340 --> 01:44:04,020
gain let's say access to systems

2025
01:44:04,020 --> 01:44:05,400
that we want not

2026
01:44:05,400 --> 01:44:08,119
attacks that are less frequent in

2027
01:44:08,119 --> 01:44:11,040
these npc systems that correspond to

2028
01:44:11,040 --> 01:44:13,860
Brute Force attacks Yes really

2029
01:44:13,860 --> 01:44:16,199
if they can be done if they can be done

2030
01:44:16,199 --> 01:44:19,500
but it wouldn't make much sense because

2031
01:44:19,500 --> 01:44:21,540
that the complexity of the keys that

2032
01:44:21,540 --> 01:44:24,540
they have the npc and clothing systems

2033
01:44:24,540 --> 01:44:27,300
and Dick would take us a long time

2034
01:44:27,300 --> 01:44:29,639
to be able to obtain one of the keys

2035
01:44:29,639 --> 01:44:32,280
we are talking about years if we can

2036
01:44:32,280 --> 01:44:34,260
a reader to function with an attack of

2037
01:44:34,260 --> 01:44:36,840
Brute Force So let's say if the

2038
01:44:36,840 --> 01:44:38,460
question is if it is possible if it is possible

2039
01:44:38,460 --> 01:44:41,760
but they are not so common to use it because

2040
01:44:41,760 --> 01:44:43,260
others really take advantage

2041
01:44:43,260 --> 01:44:45,239
vulnerabilities on the subject Ya del

2042
01:44:45,239 --> 01:44:47,880
encryption over the communication channel

2043
01:44:47,880 --> 01:44:49,440
that allow me to get it much more

2044
01:44:49,440 --> 01:44:52,020
fast No yes by a Force attack

2045
01:44:52,020 --> 01:44:54,060
gross we are going to spend 10 years maybe

2046
01:44:54,060 --> 01:44:55,800
in a middle man attack do it in

2047
01:44:55,800 --> 01:44:57,719
5 minutes So really like not

2048
01:44:57,719 --> 01:45:00,380
would it make sense to use

2049
01:45:00,380 --> 01:45:02,480
some of the tools that

2050
01:45:02,480 --> 01:45:04,500
we use for all this type of

2051
01:45:04,500 --> 01:45:07,219
investigations because they are readers

2052
01:45:07,219 --> 01:45:09,480
that we can get anywhere

2053
01:45:09,480 --> 01:45:11,699
page like Amazon like eBay like

2054
01:45:11,699 --> 01:45:14,100
MercadoLibre yes these are classics

2055
01:45:14,100 --> 01:45:15,659
white readers that we see there in the

2056
01:45:15,659 --> 01:45:17,280
picture we also have others

2057
01:45:17,280 --> 01:45:19,139
devices like the prosmart like the

2058
01:45:19,139 --> 01:45:22,440
chameleon tini the red chameleon we have

2059
01:45:22,440 --> 01:45:23,880
cards obviously we have to

2060
01:45:23,880 --> 01:45:25,860
get blank cards that we

2061
01:45:25,860 --> 01:45:28,440
allow us to do all the tests we have

2062
01:45:28,440 --> 01:45:30,119
used mobile devices

2063
01:45:30,119 --> 01:45:33,239
they have this npc protocol to be able to

2064
01:45:33,239 --> 01:45:35,760
also interact modify balances and

2065
01:45:35,760 --> 01:45:38,520
do some some tests we use

2066
01:45:38,520 --> 01:45:40,800
the Cali suite Obviously the Cali well

2067
01:45:40,800 --> 01:45:42,780
already has some bookstores and some

2068
01:45:42,780 --> 01:45:44,880
apps that help us do this

2069
01:45:44,880 --> 01:45:48,060
a little easier and I think no less

2070
01:45:48,060 --> 01:45:49,739
our intelligence is important

2071
01:45:49,739 --> 01:45:51,920
Really

2072
01:45:51,920 --> 01:45:55,560
many times the tools do not

2073
01:45:55,560 --> 01:45:58,560
let us get where we want to go

2074
01:45:58,560 --> 01:46:00,540
we can feel frustrated because I made a

2075
01:46:00,540 --> 01:46:03,119
attack and it didn't come out or it didn't work for me

2076
01:46:03,119 --> 01:46:04,560
I can have the data you wanted

2077
01:46:04,560 --> 01:46:07,380
then it lies in the ability

2078
01:46:07,380 --> 01:46:09,360
we have to reason and

2079
01:46:09,360 --> 01:46:11,400
generate as new scenarios and new

2080
01:46:11,400 --> 01:46:13,380
possibilities towards these vectors of

2081
01:46:13,380 --> 01:46:15,300
attack that we define for each

2082
01:46:15,300 --> 01:46:18,420
one of the scenarios no Then until

2083
01:46:18,420 --> 01:46:20,760
here the part as theoretical let's see

2084
01:46:20,760 --> 01:46:23,100
a bit about the part of how the

2085
01:46:23,100 --> 01:46:25,920
systems And what system we can see in

2086
01:46:25,920 --> 01:46:28,500
the ones I was working on then

2087
01:46:28,500 --> 01:46:31,440
let's start with the first first thing

2088
01:46:31,440 --> 01:46:34,199
we call system x obviously so as not to

2089
01:46:34,199 --> 01:46:36,360
give give their names for reasons of

2090
01:46:36,360 --> 01:46:38,880
confidentiality. So in this

2091
01:46:38,880 --> 01:46:40,800
system we have a card

2092
01:46:40,800 --> 01:46:43,199
which is what allows us to enter the

2093
01:46:43,199 --> 01:46:46,199
transportation system how it works

2094
01:46:46,199 --> 01:46:47,940
I have to put my card to enter

2095
01:46:47,940 --> 01:46:50,040
I have to put my card back to

2096
01:46:50,040 --> 01:46:53,420
exit system Yes this system has

2097
01:46:53,420 --> 01:46:57,540
a form of purchase and recharge where

2098
01:46:57,540 --> 01:46:59,820
I can by vending machines or by

2099
01:46:59,820 --> 01:47:02,580
box office buy my cards and put

2100
01:47:02,580 --> 01:47:04,380
balance yes So I can get to the

2101
01:47:04,380 --> 01:47:05,219
machine

2102
01:47:05,219 --> 01:47:07,739
I put the money on my card and it will go to me

2103
01:47:07,739 --> 01:47:09,360
charge automatically or

2104
01:47:09,360 --> 01:47:10,920
just a box office where I

2105
01:47:10,920 --> 01:47:12,179
a person attends and I can do the

2106
01:47:12,179 --> 01:47:13,520
same operation

2107
01:47:13,520 --> 01:47:15,800
in theory

2108
01:47:15,800 --> 01:47:18,480
this system is centralized has a

2109
01:47:18,480 --> 01:47:20,880
centralized database where it is

2110
01:47:20,880 --> 01:47:22,639
storing card balances yes

2111
01:47:22,639 --> 01:47:25,800
because in the year 2013 there were

2112
01:47:25,800 --> 01:47:27,540
here a security issue in Mexico in

2113
01:47:27,540 --> 01:47:29,340
where the subway was made and accepted

2114
01:47:29,340 --> 01:47:31,100
all transportation systems

2115
01:47:31,100 --> 01:47:33,360
So they said No, well, we're not going to

2116
01:47:33,360 --> 01:47:34,800
change the technology what we are going to

2117
01:47:34,800 --> 01:47:36,600
do is let's centralize the balances

2118
01:47:36,600 --> 01:47:39,119
in a database and we are going to have

2119
01:47:39,119 --> 01:47:40,800
this database so that the user

2120
01:47:40,800 --> 01:47:43,199
Through a mobile application you can

2121
01:47:43,199 --> 01:47:46,320
check your balance yes then I'm going to

2122
01:47:46,320 --> 01:47:48,659
put my app on my android or on

2123
01:47:48,659 --> 01:47:50,460
my iPhone I'm going to put my number

2124
01:47:50,460 --> 01:47:52,199
card and he goes to consult in the base

2125
01:47:52,199 --> 01:47:53,580
of data the balance that I have ready

2126
01:47:53,580 --> 01:47:56,580
so here when we talk about

2127
01:47:56,580 --> 01:47:58,980
systems at Point external systems

2128
01:47:58,980 --> 01:48:01,920
to the system as such of npc is for

2129
01:48:01,920 --> 01:48:03,440
example these applications

2130
01:48:03,440 --> 01:48:06,179
if it is a service that is very good for

2131
01:48:06,179 --> 01:48:07,860
the user because it allows me to have

2132
01:48:07,860 --> 01:48:10,860
Well, easily the balance but we

2133
01:48:10,860 --> 01:48:13,380
we forget that they may be exposing

2134
01:48:13,380 --> 01:48:15,719
data also at a security level and

2135
01:48:15,719 --> 01:48:17,460
We are going to see that indeed in

2136
01:48:17,460 --> 01:48:19,560
this system we find a unique

2137
01:48:19,560 --> 01:48:21,000
vulnerability in mobile application

2138
01:48:21,000 --> 01:48:22,679
that allowed us to do much more

2139
01:48:22,679 --> 01:48:25,920
what we were going to do initially

2140
01:48:25,920 --> 01:48:28,040
the gym system

2141
01:48:28,040 --> 01:48:32,100
It is let's say that similar also has the

2142
01:48:32,100 --> 01:48:36,360
same label in this system I can

2143
01:48:36,360 --> 01:48:39,600
check the balance in some readers that

2144
01:48:39,600 --> 01:48:42,179
there is in the system I am going to do with my

2145
01:48:42,179 --> 01:48:43,980
card tells me what balance I have without

2146
01:48:43,980 --> 01:48:45,679
need to recharge

2147
01:48:45,679 --> 01:48:50,159
I can recharge it at the box office or at points

2148
01:48:50,159 --> 01:48:52,199
for sale then this system has

2149
01:48:52,199 --> 01:48:54,960
external points of sale that do not have

2150
01:48:54,960 --> 01:48:57,600
nothing to do with the system can

2151
01:48:57,600 --> 01:48:59,460
be stationers can be pharmacies

2152
01:48:59,460 --> 01:49:00,780
drugstores Well any

2153
01:49:00,780 --> 01:49:02,940
business establishment that can

2154
01:49:02,940 --> 01:49:06,119
allow to recharge my card I can

2155
01:49:06,119 --> 01:49:09,179
enter the system and be able to exchange

2156
01:49:09,179 --> 01:49:12,020
among the types of vehicles that exist without

2157
01:49:12,020 --> 01:49:17,040
pay double ticket no sorry so I

2158
01:49:17,040 --> 01:49:18,960
can i switch between these types of

2159
01:49:18,960 --> 01:49:21,600
vehicles do not charge me passage obviously

2160
01:49:21,600 --> 01:49:23,460
I have to pass my card but I don't

2161
01:49:23,460 --> 01:49:25,440
They charge a ticket if I make a change between

2162
01:49:25,440 --> 01:49:27,780
the same this type of vehicle there yes I

2163
01:49:27,780 --> 01:49:30,600
I would charge a ticket again, not a

2164
01:49:30,600 --> 01:49:34,860
travel ticket and system Z is

2165
01:49:34,860 --> 01:49:36,780
as a mix between system x and system

2166
01:49:36,780 --> 01:49:39,780
system and I don't have the interaction against

2167
01:49:39,780 --> 01:49:42,119
I change vehicles I have the readers

2168
01:49:42,119 --> 01:49:43,860
to check the balance I have the

2169
01:49:43,860 --> 01:49:45,360
machines to recharge automatically

2170
01:49:45,360 --> 01:49:47,280
I have the points of sale I have the

2171
01:49:47,280 --> 01:49:50,340
lockers and here they do not have centralized

2172
01:49:50,340 --> 01:49:52,080
in an app in an app

2173
01:49:52,080 --> 01:49:54,480
mobile but the consultation is made by a

2174
01:49:54,480 --> 01:49:56,760
web system So I can consult

2175
01:49:56,760 --> 01:49:59,880
on the web page of the system with the

2176
01:49:59,880 --> 01:50:01,739
my card number the balance I have

2177
01:50:01,739 --> 01:50:04,260
I currently ready that way

2178
01:50:04,260 --> 01:50:07,739
we can have What value do I have in me

2179
01:50:07,739 --> 01:50:09,900
card as such done So these

2180
01:50:09,900 --> 01:50:12,619
are the three systems

2181
01:50:13,219 --> 01:50:15,300
and now let's go to the part

2182
01:50:15,300 --> 01:50:18,360
practice So the first thing

2183
01:50:18,360 --> 01:50:20,280
we identify in the system x is the type

2184
01:50:20,280 --> 01:50:21,840
of card that we are

2185
01:50:21,840 --> 01:50:25,560
working yes this is well known

2186
01:50:25,560 --> 01:50:27,780
Master Classic card because it has been

2187
01:50:27,780 --> 01:50:31,500
treatment of many studies at the level of

2188
01:50:31,500 --> 01:50:34,380
security and despite the years it continues

2189
01:50:34,380 --> 01:50:36,960
using because he keeps using for his

2190
01:50:36,960 --> 01:50:39,840
value is obviously very economical and for

2191
01:50:39,840 --> 01:50:43,980
its ease of use and speed of use in

2192
01:50:43,980 --> 01:50:45,840
systems not then these cards

2193
01:50:45,840 --> 01:50:48,000
are everywhere. Although we

2194
01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:50,820
Let's say that 10-15 years ago they began to

2195
01:50:50,820 --> 01:50:53,699
make vulnerable still present

2196
01:50:53,699 --> 01:50:55,500
in many systems and not only

2197
01:50:55,500 --> 01:50:57,900
transport not y in system x also

2198
01:50:57,900 --> 01:51:00,840
We found something that by making a name

2199
01:51:00,840 --> 01:51:02,540
medium between mobile application

2200
01:51:02,540 --> 01:51:04,800
we could get the package from

2201
01:51:04,800 --> 01:51:07,920
count of the text Sure yes where

2202
01:51:07,920 --> 01:51:10,739
just us sending you an inti

2203
01:51:10,739 --> 01:51:12,900
of the card we could obtain the balance

2204
01:51:12,900 --> 01:51:16,560
that I had true now it turns out that the

2205
01:51:16,560 --> 01:51:17,840
idea card

2206
01:51:17,840 --> 01:51:22,380
corresponds to the card ID as such

2207
01:51:22,380 --> 01:51:24,179
converted to decimal then

2208
01:51:24,179 --> 01:51:26,880
practically that I could have the

2209
01:51:26,880 --> 01:51:28,500
way to obtain the balance of any

2210
01:51:28,500 --> 01:51:31,619
system card no because i could

2211
01:51:31,619 --> 01:51:34,860
convert or take the ud convert it to

2212
01:51:34,860 --> 01:51:36,239
decimal and you would already have the number that

2213
01:51:36,239 --> 01:51:37,800
they had to have to send in the

2214
01:51:37,800 --> 01:51:40,199
spare to get it not in system

2215
01:51:40,199 --> 01:51:42,719
and we see that it is the same card and in the

2216
01:51:42,719 --> 01:51:44,340
system Z we see that it is the same card

2217
01:51:44,340 --> 01:51:46,679
even though they are three different systems

2218
01:51:46,679 --> 01:51:48,840
from different cities of countries

2219
01:51:48,840 --> 01:51:51,179
different use the same card

2220
01:51:51,179 --> 01:51:53,639
but they have different levels of

2221
01:51:53,639 --> 01:51:55,739
I'm sure we'll see him right now

2222
01:51:55,739 --> 01:51:57,300
ahead in each of the tests that

2223
01:51:57,300 --> 01:52:00,060
we made it ready then

2224
01:52:00,060 --> 01:52:02,840
first thing we did that we managed to do

2225
01:52:02,840 --> 01:52:06,239
by means of an attack obtain at least

2226
01:52:06,239 --> 01:52:09,179
a key of the 32 keys that

2227
01:52:09,179 --> 01:52:12,300
we needed for the card Yes this

2228
01:52:12,300 --> 01:52:13,340
stroke

2229
01:52:13,340 --> 01:52:16,380
it takes between 15 or 20 minutes more or

2230
01:52:16,380 --> 01:52:17,000
less

2231
01:52:17,000 --> 01:52:19,560
depending on the card and it recovers us

2232
01:52:19,560 --> 01:52:21,960
a sector and block key that

2233
01:52:21,960 --> 01:52:24,600
we say yes with this key

2234
01:52:24,600 --> 01:52:27,060
that allows us to do So let's

2235
01:52:27,060 --> 01:52:29,219
make another attack so that we

2236
01:52:29,219 --> 01:52:32,580
allows you to have the 32 keys of the entire

2237
01:52:32,580 --> 01:52:35,699
card Yes after having all 32

2238
01:52:35,699 --> 01:52:38,340
keys I'm going to get Well here they are

2239
01:52:38,340 --> 01:52:40,320
evidence of how the

2240
01:52:40,320 --> 01:52:43,320
keys I'll have the dump

2241
01:52:43,320 --> 01:52:45,360
memory where I have all the information

2242
01:52:45,360 --> 01:52:47,340
what is on the card

2243
01:52:47,340 --> 01:52:50,460
So after having the information

2244
01:52:50,460 --> 01:52:53,219
Well, I already have a lot of work

2245
01:52:53,219 --> 01:52:57,239
done yes now i need to check that that

2246
01:52:57,239 --> 01:52:59,219
information is coherent or I can

2247
01:52:59,219 --> 01:53:01,100
interpret it somehow then

2248
01:53:01,100 --> 01:53:03,480
seeing all this amount of numbers

2249
01:53:03,480 --> 01:53:06,239
Well, what I know was a bit complicated.

2250
01:53:06,239 --> 01:53:09,239
did was use a python script from

2251
01:53:09,239 --> 01:53:10,739
way to take the doom of the

2252
01:53:10,739 --> 01:53:12,540
card or the information contained on the card

2253
01:53:12,540 --> 01:53:13,280
card

2254
01:53:13,280 --> 01:53:16,320
and it was a little more visible with options

2255
01:53:16,320 --> 01:53:19,639
of the accesses it had for each

2256
01:53:19,639 --> 01:53:22,560
sector and blocks the information a bit

2257
01:53:22,560 --> 01:53:25,679
clearer if they were in raw data and

2258
01:53:25,679 --> 01:53:26,880
were numerical data so that

2259
01:53:26,880 --> 01:53:30,000
we could make one

2260
01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:31,800
slightly clearer identification of

2261
01:53:31,800 --> 01:53:33,119
where was the correct information

2262
01:53:33,119 --> 01:53:36,420
So doing a couple of tests with

2263
01:53:36,420 --> 01:53:37,880
System of

2264
01:53:37,880 --> 01:53:40,560
Genuine obviously we managed to find

2265
01:53:40,560 --> 01:53:43,080
that in the system x the information is

2266
01:53:43,080 --> 01:53:44,520
kept in a block in a sector

2267
01:53:44,520 --> 01:53:47,699
specific Yes, I kept the balance here

2268
01:53:47,699 --> 01:53:51,000
of the card the balance that the

2269
01:53:51,000 --> 01:53:52,560
person on card currently

2270
01:53:52,560 --> 01:53:54,020
Then

2271
01:53:54,020 --> 01:53:58,320
when making or trying to make a change

2272
01:53:58,320 --> 01:54:03,380
from letter to a decimal or aski we did not have

2273
01:54:03,380 --> 01:54:06,600
a coherent balance of what we did

2274
01:54:06,600 --> 01:54:08,400
to do there is an analysis where

2275
01:54:08,400 --> 01:54:10,500
we could change positions

2276
01:54:10,500 --> 01:54:13,080
had the chain so we could

2277
01:54:13,080 --> 01:54:15,179
the balance does not then we develop a

2278
01:54:15,179 --> 01:54:17,340
small Script where I put the

2279
01:54:17,340 --> 01:54:20,100
chain as such And he told me in numbers

2280
01:54:20,100 --> 01:54:21,840
the corresponding balance then here

2281
01:54:21,840 --> 01:54:24,060
we see in the image that indeed if

2282
01:54:24,060 --> 01:54:25,980
we put a value of the card in

2283
01:54:25,980 --> 01:54:28,260
made or we had the balance that we could

2284
01:54:28,260 --> 01:54:32,159
compare with the machine where we can

2285
01:54:32,159 --> 01:54:33,900
recharge us our card Yes

2286
01:54:33,900 --> 01:54:37,199
So we already know where he is

2287
01:54:37,199 --> 01:54:40,500
balance we already say is here where it is and

2288
01:54:40,500 --> 01:54:42,540
this is how it is saved then

2289
01:54:42,540 --> 01:54:45,239
could we Modify a balance

2290
01:54:45,239 --> 01:54:48,480
like so yes then we did this test

2291
01:54:48,480 --> 01:54:50,940
where we put a decimal balance that

2292
01:54:50,940 --> 01:54:53,040
it was impossible to recharge it for a

2293
01:54:53,040 --> 01:54:55,560
machine so that I did not go to

2294
01:54:55,560 --> 01:54:58,080
say Ah no, well, if you put 200

2295
01:54:58,080 --> 01:54:59,940
pesos Well, there it will be able in the

2296
01:54:59,940 --> 01:55:02,159
machine and it can be cheating. Not here

2297
01:55:02,159 --> 01:55:04,020
we put a balance with a decimal point

2298
01:55:04,020 --> 01:55:05,639
67

2299
01:55:05,639 --> 01:55:08,400
The reader took the card validated it

2300
01:55:08,400 --> 01:55:11,460
completely the balance we made a

2301
01:55:11,460 --> 01:55:15,960
recharge of 5 pesos and it took us the recharge

2302
01:55:15,960 --> 01:55:18,840
as valid the balance of

2303
01:55:18,840 --> 01:55:21,119
the card with the new balance is called

2304
01:55:21,119 --> 01:55:23,219
the 5 pesos that we recharged and still

2305
01:55:23,219 --> 01:55:25,260
kept the point 67 that we put on it

2306
01:55:25,260 --> 01:55:27,719
we don't then this way anymore

2307
01:55:27,719 --> 01:55:29,460
we were able to verify that indeed

2308
01:55:29,460 --> 01:55:32,159
we could Modify a balance towards a

2309
01:55:32,159 --> 01:55:35,280
genuine card not then here i

2310
01:55:35,280 --> 01:55:38,580
I can put a value and I just go

2311
01:55:38,580 --> 01:55:40,619
I add a peso and I'm going to have the

2312
01:55:40,619 --> 01:55:42,179
actual balance no

2313
01:55:42,179 --> 01:55:44,780
now

2314
01:55:45,480 --> 01:55:48,659
we did the cloning or take the

2315
01:55:48,659 --> 01:55:51,360
genuine card information and

2316
01:55:51,360 --> 01:55:55,199
put it on a blank card yeah Al

2317
01:55:55,199 --> 01:55:58,139
principle did not work under the principle

2318
01:55:58,139 --> 01:56:00,480
that the manufacturers have that are not

2319
01:56:00,480 --> 01:56:02,520
you can clone the White or you can't

2320
01:56:02,520 --> 01:56:04,860
modify the wi-fi of the cards no

2321
01:56:04,860 --> 01:56:06,719
but it turns out that in the market we

2322
01:56:06,719 --> 01:56:09,239
We already have cards that do allow us

2323
01:56:09,239 --> 01:56:11,880
make this modification Because if we

2324
01:56:11,880 --> 01:56:13,920
allow you to put 100% of the information

2325
01:56:13,920 --> 01:56:16,080
of the card or we can simply

2326
01:56:16,080 --> 01:56:19,440
use a Chameleon or a prosmart to

2327
01:56:19,440 --> 01:56:20,940
emulate the card and that way

2328
01:56:20,940 --> 01:56:24,000
we can have 100%. so there

2329
01:56:24,000 --> 01:56:25,980
we have a card that is white that

2330
01:56:25,980 --> 01:56:28,020
is blank that is not from the system that

2331
01:56:28,020 --> 01:56:31,100
It's not genuine. Where can we put it?

2332
01:56:31,100 --> 01:56:33,960
the voter and he is going to return the

2333
01:56:33,960 --> 01:56:36,239
balance that the card has even

2334
01:56:36,239 --> 01:56:41,100
we recharged this card and the

2335
01:56:41,100 --> 01:56:43,260
recharge was valid not there we can see in

2336
01:56:43,260 --> 01:56:45,420
the image that had an initial balance

2337
01:56:45,420 --> 01:56:47,820
five pesos and gave us the total balance No

2338
01:56:47,820 --> 01:56:51,780
now it turns out what happens

2339
01:56:51,780 --> 01:56:54,119
we did some tests with the card

2340
01:56:54,119 --> 01:56:56,520
original and with the blank card that

2341
01:56:56,520 --> 01:56:59,940
is cloned that have the same wd and

2342
01:56:59,940 --> 01:57:02,219
we found an inconsistency in the

2343
01:57:02,219 --> 01:57:06,060
data, that is, I could have balances

2344
01:57:06,060 --> 01:57:07,820
different on two cards that are

2345
01:57:07,820 --> 01:57:12,000
equal real then in this way

2346
01:57:12,000 --> 01:57:14,340
What could we do with that?

2347
01:57:14,340 --> 01:57:15,780
we can do with it because

2348
01:57:15,780 --> 01:57:18,060
this vulnerability is live

2349
01:57:18,060 --> 01:57:20,340
Not nowadays. So I can because of

2350
01:57:20,340 --> 01:57:22,860
by means of a card to modify the

2351
01:57:22,860 --> 01:57:25,980
balance to another card yes by means of a

2352
01:57:25,980 --> 01:57:27,659
magic card or a card that i

2353
01:57:27,659 --> 01:57:30,119
I think I can modify and increase it myself

2354
01:57:30,119 --> 01:57:32,699
or obviously decrease the balance of a

2355
01:57:32,699 --> 01:57:35,340
fully valid card then here

2356
01:57:35,340 --> 01:57:37,040
is inconsistency in the data

2357
01:57:37,040 --> 01:57:39,179
makes us understand that there is no

2358
01:57:39,179 --> 01:57:41,280
database level validations

2359
01:57:41,280 --> 01:57:43,260
where is centralized so that

2360
01:57:43,260 --> 01:57:45,780
we can make this exchange

2361
01:57:45,780 --> 01:57:46,820
of information

2362
01:57:46,820 --> 01:57:49,920
really Well, why don't they validate it?

2363
01:57:49,920 --> 01:57:52,380
I know if the solution is supposed to

2364
01:57:52,380 --> 01:57:54,599
all the vulnerability is that they had in

2365
01:57:54,599 --> 01:57:56,400
the theme of 2013 was centralization

2366
01:57:56,400 --> 01:57:59,219
of databases but here we can

2367
01:57:59,219 --> 01:58:01,380
appreciate that indeed no no no

2368
01:58:01,380 --> 01:58:02,780
works

2369
01:58:02,780 --> 01:58:05,699
we made a Script obviously having the

2370
01:58:05,699 --> 01:58:07,619
application capture packet

2371
01:58:07,619 --> 01:58:10,320
mobile a written in python a small

2372
01:58:10,320 --> 01:58:12,360
written, that is, they can see it and those who

2373
01:58:12,360 --> 01:58:13,739
have knowledge of that they will say

2374
01:58:13,739 --> 01:58:16,980
They are very simple where we had to

2375
01:58:16,980 --> 01:58:18,659
I sent them a number who

2376
01:58:18,659 --> 01:58:21,060
the jump returned not then here anymore

2377
01:58:21,060 --> 01:58:22,560
I was taking advantage of the vulnerability

2378
01:58:22,560 --> 01:58:26,820
about the mobile application and I

2379
01:58:26,820 --> 01:58:30,900
it happened that I could get the

2380
01:58:30,900 --> 01:58:34,199
id generation pattern such that

2381
01:58:34,199 --> 01:58:36,420
could have the balance of all

2382
01:58:36,420 --> 01:58:38,280
system cards

2383
01:58:38,280 --> 01:58:40,760
at first it was a bit difficult because

2384
01:58:40,760 --> 01:58:44,400
one would think that it is 1 2 3 4 5 6 but no

2385
01:58:44,400 --> 01:58:46,739
it is so they have a pattern

2386
01:58:46,739 --> 01:58:50,040
generation special at the end we could

2387
01:58:50,040 --> 01:58:53,040
get yes where by changing a couple of

2388
01:58:53,040 --> 01:58:55,679
netsa values ​​we could get all

2389
01:58:55,679 --> 01:58:59,119
those of all the cards in the system

2390
01:58:59,119 --> 01:59:02,520
So if I can have the

2391
01:59:02,520 --> 01:59:04,800
Haitian them with the balances of the system and

2392
01:59:04,800 --> 01:59:06,540
I can mount a card that I can

2393
01:59:06,540 --> 01:59:09,659
manufacture completely I can spend myself

2394
01:59:09,659 --> 01:59:11,280
the balance of any person in the

2395
01:59:11,280 --> 01:59:14,159
transport system yes then i can

2396
01:59:14,159 --> 01:59:16,619
get to say ah that person has 200

2397
01:59:16,619 --> 01:59:19,619
weights I will put this ID step with the ID

2398
01:59:19,619 --> 01:59:21,239
and I spend El Salto of the person

2399
01:59:21,239 --> 01:59:23,219
Obviously the person is not going to give

2400
01:59:23,219 --> 01:59:24,540
counts until it does not get to make a

2401
01:59:24,540 --> 01:59:25,860
recharge or get to make use of the system

2402
01:59:25,860 --> 01:59:28,920
where you see that your balance is either less or

2403
01:59:28,920 --> 01:59:30,659
You no longer have a balance obviously in the

2404
01:59:30,659 --> 01:59:33,060
card turns out that these tests

2405
01:59:33,060 --> 01:59:36,540
we did like two years ago and a year ago

2406
01:59:36,540 --> 01:59:38,580
they had an update this

2407
01:59:38,580 --> 01:59:40,739
system said Ok it seems that we

2408
01:59:40,739 --> 01:59:42,900
they are hacking it seems that someone is

2409
01:59:42,900 --> 01:59:45,179
taking advantage of this we are going to change

2410
01:59:45,179 --> 01:59:47,820
a configuration on the cards and

2411
01:59:47,820 --> 01:59:49,560
we are going to put the keys to be

2412
01:59:49,560 --> 01:59:52,739
dynamic and the keys the card does not work

2413
01:59:52,739 --> 01:59:54,239
to have all the cards the same

2414
01:59:54,239 --> 01:59:56,520
keys otherwise we are going to leave a generation

2415
01:59:56,520 --> 01:59:58,080
dynamic that is an update that

2416
01:59:58,080 --> 02:00:00,420
has the myper Classic that this avoids

2417
02:00:00,420 --> 02:00:02,400
that the first attacks that we show

2418
02:00:02,400 --> 02:00:05,159
here they work and they cannot recover the

2419
02:00:05,159 --> 02:00:08,580
keys but they forgot something that

2420
02:00:08,580 --> 02:00:11,280
they left a sector with an equal key

2421
02:00:11,280 --> 02:00:13,679
for everyone and this key we

2422
02:00:13,679 --> 02:00:15,840
we had then with this key and with

2423
02:00:15,840 --> 02:00:18,300
help of the prosmart with a germaster

2424
02:00:18,300 --> 02:00:21,239
we were able to recover the dynamic keys

2425
02:00:21,239 --> 02:00:23,639
of the cards then the keys that

2426
02:00:23,639 --> 02:00:25,080
we couldn't get from the cards

2427
02:00:25,080 --> 02:00:27,119
new with this attack and with this key

2428
02:00:27,119 --> 02:00:29,340
that we had we could already obtain

2429
02:00:29,340 --> 02:00:31,980
all Yes then

2430
02:00:31,980 --> 02:00:34,920
We verify that the

2431
02:00:34,920 --> 02:00:38,179
balance on the card and that we can

2432
02:00:38,179 --> 02:00:41,040
replicate all the tests we have

2433
02:00:41,040 --> 02:00:43,500
seen before not then we came back

2434
02:00:43,500 --> 02:00:45,840
We return to obtaining the keys

2435
02:00:45,840 --> 02:00:49,260
to have all the information and we returned to

2436
02:00:49,260 --> 02:00:51,599
check that yes it could be violated no

2437
02:00:51,599 --> 02:00:53,420
then

2438
02:00:53,420 --> 02:00:55,320
we do the tests again

2439
02:00:55,320 --> 02:00:57,239
modifications indeed all

2440
02:00:57,239 --> 02:00:59,580
cloning worked we see that the

2441
02:00:59,580 --> 02:01:00,780
card seen at the bottom

2442
02:01:00,780 --> 02:01:02,540
obviously not a system card

2443
02:01:02,540 --> 02:01:06,239
It's a card we bought in the 401 and

2444
02:01:06,239 --> 02:01:08,060
that we could

2445
02:01:08,060 --> 02:01:11,360
Modify the balance even put values

2446
02:01:11,360 --> 02:01:14,940
extremely high yes a balance of

2447
02:01:14,940 --> 02:01:17,219
2,000 Mexican pesos corresponds more or

2448
02:01:17,219 --> 02:01:19,500
less like 100 dollars that is a balance

2449
02:01:19,500 --> 02:01:22,440
that it will last me a long time and that

2450
02:01:22,440 --> 02:01:24,599
can make use of the system how many

2451
02:01:24,599 --> 02:01:26,280
times I need and if I run out I can

2452
02:01:26,280 --> 02:01:28,320
recharge him again then i could

2453
02:01:28,320 --> 02:01:31,139
modify up to a figure between 2000 and

2454
02:01:31,139 --> 02:01:34,080
5000 pesos more or less we don't have the

2455
02:01:34,080 --> 02:01:36,300
exact figure because then do this type

2456
02:01:36,300 --> 02:01:38,280
testing in real scenarios is

2457
02:01:38,280 --> 02:01:40,560
a bit complicated so no

2458
02:01:40,560 --> 02:01:43,199
we have, let's say, an access as such

2459
02:01:43,199 --> 02:01:45,020
then

2460
02:01:45,020 --> 02:01:47,400
we did this test we managed to recharge

2461
02:01:47,400 --> 02:01:49,800
2000 pesos and effectively the system

2462
02:01:49,800 --> 02:01:52,860
takes them as valid Now I recharge

2463
02:01:52,860 --> 02:01:54,719
the 2,000 pesos and I only have to

2464
02:01:54,719 --> 02:01:56,940
get to the machine and reload a weight

2465
02:01:56,940 --> 02:01:59,760
so that this balance is updated in the

2466
02:01:59,760 --> 02:02:01,800
application then in these new

2467
02:02:01,800 --> 02:02:04,020
tests that we did we went back to see about

2468
02:02:04,020 --> 02:02:08,580
the issue of data inconsistency or

2469
02:02:08,580 --> 02:02:10,520
this information in the database

2470
02:02:10,520 --> 02:02:14,400
we take three cards one genuine two

2471
02:02:14,400 --> 02:02:17,099
Obviously they weren't genuine

2472
02:02:17,099 --> 02:02:20,580
but they were 100% cloned and we found the

2473
02:02:20,580 --> 02:02:22,139
same same subject of data

2474
02:02:22,139 --> 02:02:25,560
we could have different balances in the

2475
02:02:25,560 --> 02:02:28,619
three cards being the same that is if

2476
02:02:28,619 --> 02:02:31,080
we took the ID the three cards were

2477
02:02:31,080 --> 02:02:33,719
They have the same ID but with balances

2478
02:02:33,719 --> 02:02:36,360
different then we rechecked

2479
02:02:36,360 --> 02:02:38,760
that I can update the balance of one

2480
02:02:38,760 --> 02:02:40,980
genuine card by means of a card

2481
02:02:40,980 --> 02:02:44,340
cloned not obviously up to here the

2482
02:02:44,340 --> 02:02:46,739
tests we did was modification of

2483
02:02:46,739 --> 02:02:48,719
the recharging machine but also

2484
02:02:48,719 --> 02:02:51,780
we gain access to the system, that is, with

2485
02:02:51,780 --> 02:02:53,400
a cloned card that you can see there

2486
02:02:53,400 --> 02:02:55,739
you in the photos we managed to access

2487
02:02:55,739 --> 02:02:58,380
both validation on input and

2488
02:02:58,380 --> 02:03:00,659
validation on output without any

2489
02:03:00,659 --> 02:03:02,400
inconvenient No Then I could already

2490
02:03:02,400 --> 02:03:03,960
be I using the balance of a

2491
02:03:03,960 --> 02:03:06,540
card that there is no system and if

2492
02:03:06,540 --> 02:03:09,380
we check in the app

2493
02:03:09,380 --> 02:03:11,400
we put the card number

2494
02:03:11,400 --> 02:03:13,440
returned the balances that we

2495
02:03:13,440 --> 02:03:14,880
we put the card that was a card

2496
02:03:14,880 --> 02:03:18,300
of 500 pesos and another card of $2,000 not

2497
02:03:18,300 --> 02:03:21,239
so all these vulnerabilities

2498
02:03:21,239 --> 02:03:24,000
are present in the system at your

2499
02:03:24,000 --> 02:03:26,940
moment we wanted or we looked for the

2500
02:03:26,940 --> 02:03:28,679
way to contact people

2501
02:03:28,679 --> 02:03:31,320
handle these systems the truth Never

2502
02:03:31,320 --> 02:03:33,080
we had no answer

2503
02:03:33,080 --> 02:03:36,480
The curious thing is that one goes to the system and

2504
02:03:36,480 --> 02:03:38,280
they have advertising everywhere

2505
02:03:38,280 --> 02:03:40,679
They say don't buy recharged cards

2506
02:03:40,679 --> 02:03:43,260
way illegally or do not let

2507
02:03:43,260 --> 02:03:46,080
scam then they know they have

2508
02:03:46,080 --> 02:03:47,880
vulnerabilities in us wanted

2509
02:03:47,880 --> 02:03:50,099
give them to understand and show them

2510
02:03:50,099 --> 02:03:52,440
some possibilities for improvement do not

2511
02:03:52,440 --> 02:03:54,719
they attended Well suddenly one day we

2512
02:03:54,719 --> 02:03:57,719
look no now that was only in the

2513
02:03:57,719 --> 02:04:00,300
system x we ​​go with the system y that is

2514
02:04:00,300 --> 02:04:01,639
the second system

2515
02:04:01,639 --> 02:04:04,199
So in this system the same

2516
02:04:04,199 --> 02:04:07,320
we had the information but here was more

2517
02:04:07,320 --> 02:04:08,280
complex

2518
02:04:08,280 --> 02:04:10,920
Why? Because this system does have more

2519
02:04:10,920 --> 02:04:12,599
validations than the previous system

2520
02:04:12,599 --> 02:04:14,760
So by the time we

2521
02:04:14,760 --> 02:04:16,739
we wanted to make a coronation of

2522
02:04:16,739 --> 02:04:20,460
sinaid cards then without the us

2523
02:04:20,460 --> 02:04:22,739
it marked an error in the in the reader we

2524
02:04:22,739 --> 02:04:24,960
it said card does not correspond error alle

2525
02:04:24,960 --> 02:04:26,760
the card then if there is one

2526
02:04:26,760 --> 02:04:28,679
id validation where I can't

2527
02:04:28,679 --> 02:04:31,739
generate cards left AND right

2528
02:04:31,739 --> 02:04:35,219
in this transport system we did not

2529
02:04:35,219 --> 02:04:38,400
a 100% clone with a Magic Card Y

2530
02:04:38,400 --> 02:04:40,860
in this in this scenario if you take it

2531
02:04:40,860 --> 02:04:43,980
as valid because in the end all the

2532
02:04:43,980 --> 02:04:47,659
information no but we can't

2533
02:04:47,659 --> 02:04:50,520
understand how the

2534
02:04:50,520 --> 02:04:52,920
balance because in the end if there is a

2535
02:04:52,920 --> 02:04:55,500
validations of

2536
02:04:55,500 --> 02:04:57,599
every move you make

2537
02:04:57,599 --> 02:05:00,480
card Yes then it is not only

2538
02:05:00,480 --> 02:05:02,340
save in a sector or in a block the

2539
02:05:02,340 --> 02:05:05,460
value of the balance that one has but does not have

2540
02:05:05,460 --> 02:05:07,380
validations such as

2541
02:05:07,380 --> 02:05:09,599
terminal where the date was made in

2542
02:05:09,599 --> 02:05:13,080
where it was made and some elements of

2543
02:05:13,080 --> 02:05:15,719
control that prevent me from reaching

2544
02:05:15,719 --> 02:05:17,880
Modify balance directly Yes

2545
02:05:17,880 --> 02:05:20,760
so doing a bit of analysis

2546
02:05:20,760 --> 02:05:23,580
deeper than this stage we achieved

2547
02:05:23,580 --> 02:05:26,099
find there was even a

2548
02:05:26,099 --> 02:05:27,900
validation with bit locks

2549
02:05:27,900 --> 02:05:30,239
card access that did not allow me

2550
02:05:30,239 --> 02:05:33,540
to do a total reset then what

2551
02:05:33,540 --> 02:05:36,480
we said OK let's set one up

2552
02:05:36,480 --> 02:05:39,000
card where we ourselves are going to

2553
02:05:39,000 --> 02:05:41,159
configure the access bits and what

2554
02:05:41,159 --> 02:05:44,099
will allow us to reset the value

2555
02:05:44,099 --> 02:05:47,099
that I have recharged so if I

2556
02:05:47,099 --> 02:05:49,260
I will recharge this system of Colombia Yes

2557
02:05:49,260 --> 02:05:52,880
I will recharge 10 thousand Colombian pesos

2558
02:05:52,880 --> 02:05:55,440
I take the doom of those 10,000 pesos when

2559
02:05:55,440 --> 02:05:58,020
I finish can I restore that value

2560
02:05:58,020 --> 02:06:00,719
I can't get to modify it anymore

2561
02:06:00,719 --> 02:06:02,400
some way to put the balance

2562
02:06:02,400 --> 02:06:05,340
I wish. So yes, it's a little more

2563
02:06:05,340 --> 02:06:07,800
sure if you have a lot of controls

2564
02:06:07,800 --> 02:06:09,719
validation security But in the end

2565
02:06:09,719 --> 02:06:11,300
always has a vulnerability

2566
02:06:11,300 --> 02:06:14,400
So I could do a reload

2567
02:06:14,400 --> 02:06:16,440
big enough so that

2568
02:06:16,440 --> 02:06:20,280
I had the courage to dump it now not

2569
02:06:20,280 --> 02:06:22,860
can i copy it to other cards because

2570
02:06:22,860 --> 02:06:24,540
it would have to be on the same card

2571
02:06:24,540 --> 02:06:27,300
So this. Well, to shorten the

2572
02:06:27,300 --> 02:06:30,119
scene of the attack But in the end it is

2573
02:06:30,119 --> 02:06:32,520
possible to get this this system

2574
02:06:32,520 --> 02:06:34,199
also implements now in the new

2575
02:06:34,199 --> 02:06:36,719
cards the dynamic keys so

2576
02:06:36,719 --> 02:06:38,219
that attacks with readers

2577
02:06:38,219 --> 02:06:40,580
initials won't work

2578
02:06:40,580 --> 02:06:42,900
a middle man attack would work

2579
02:06:42,900 --> 02:06:44,940
one we took out a key and with the garden

2580
02:06:44,940 --> 02:06:46,380
Step we can get all the others

2581
02:06:46,380 --> 02:06:50,840
ready now from the Third system

2582
02:06:50,840 --> 02:06:53,820
we could not obtain the information of the

2583
02:06:53,820 --> 02:06:55,860
cards because it is a system in

2584
02:06:55,860 --> 02:06:57,540
Colombia I was in Mexico

2585
02:06:57,540 --> 02:07:00,000
while we did all the analysis and it was

2586
02:07:00,000 --> 02:07:02,400
a little difficult to be able to travel to have

2587
02:07:02,400 --> 02:07:05,760
access to this this system

2588
02:07:05,760 --> 02:07:08,400
could be vulnerable could be a

2589
02:07:08,400 --> 02:07:10,380
scenario where a person who is

2590
02:07:10,380 --> 02:07:12,239
there and have the tools can

2591
02:07:12,239 --> 02:07:14,099
make the attacks to get the

2592
02:07:14,099 --> 02:07:15,540
keys after we have the

2593
02:07:15,540 --> 02:07:17,960
keys could we

2594
02:07:17,960 --> 02:07:20,159
analyze the information to see if it is

2595
02:07:20,159 --> 02:07:21,840
you can do something similar to both

2596
02:07:21,840 --> 02:07:23,820
previous systems but in this system

2597
02:07:23,820 --> 02:07:25,800
we found was a vulnerability on

2598
02:07:25,800 --> 02:07:28,520
your web system Then

2599
02:07:28,520 --> 02:07:31,380
I put my number in the web system

2600
02:07:31,380 --> 02:07:34,320
of the card or I have the value of the balance

2601
02:07:34,320 --> 02:07:37,380
but it turns out that on the website it had

2602
02:07:37,380 --> 02:07:39,239
problems or have problems

2603
02:07:39,239 --> 02:07:42,420
certificates yes So by having a

2604
02:07:42,420 --> 02:07:44,699
certificate problem for more than

2605
02:07:44,699 --> 02:07:48,179
try to have the traffic through https

2606
02:07:48,179 --> 02:07:50,940
going to go through http no So when doing

2607
02:07:50,940 --> 02:07:53,400
by http we already know that before

2608
02:07:53,400 --> 02:07:54,900
This clear all the information and

2609
02:07:54,900 --> 02:07:57,780
we get the request that is used to

2610
02:07:57,780 --> 02:08:01,619
make the consultation now this resource

2611
02:08:01,619 --> 02:08:03,060
uses a cookie

2612
02:08:03,060 --> 02:08:05,040
unlike the memory of the

2613
02:08:05,040 --> 02:08:06,360
first system mobile app

2614
02:08:06,360 --> 02:08:08,520
uses a cookie that is the one that

2615
02:08:08,520 --> 02:08:09,960
allows to obtain the information but

2616
02:08:09,960 --> 02:08:12,179
I simply enter the browser with

2617
02:08:12,179 --> 02:08:15,900
an application or with a mozilla app or

2618
02:08:15,900 --> 02:08:17,820
from Chrome I can get the information

2619
02:08:17,820 --> 02:08:20,340
of the Cookie I can put it in my Script

2620
02:08:20,340 --> 02:08:22,280
and automatically he will answer me

2621
02:08:22,280 --> 02:08:24,800
with the balance of the card not then

2622
02:08:24,800 --> 02:08:28,380
we can do a sweep is also a

2623
02:08:28,380 --> 02:08:30,420
scenario that is open to soon more

2624
02:08:30,420 --> 02:08:32,060
studies that can be done

2625
02:08:32,060 --> 02:08:34,260
check if there is a topic that can be

2626
02:08:34,260 --> 02:08:35,820
also compromise the safety of

2627
02:08:35,820 --> 02:08:37,380
Modify the balance of making your

2628
02:08:37,380 --> 02:08:40,619
mansions and well that was what we could

2629
02:08:40,619 --> 02:08:42,420
find so far in system Z

2630
02:08:42,420 --> 02:08:44,520
then a summary of the three systems

2631
02:08:44,520 --> 02:08:46,280
that we work

2632
02:08:46,280 --> 02:08:49,020
on system x and we were able to recover

2633
02:08:49,020 --> 02:08:50,940
the keys in the acetane system By

2634
02:08:50,940 --> 02:08:54,239
not have access as such to the

2635
02:08:54,239 --> 02:08:56,099
Genuine readers to make the attacks

2636
02:08:56,099 --> 02:08:58,320
corresponding to the first two

2637
02:08:58,320 --> 02:09:00,960
we did with total relation 100% the

2638
02:09:00,960 --> 02:09:02,699
modification of information in the

2639
02:09:02,699 --> 02:09:05,280
system is complete I can put the

2640
02:09:05,280 --> 02:09:07,260
balance that I want I can from my

2641
02:09:07,260 --> 02:09:10,380
cell Modify the value I want

2642
02:09:10,380 --> 02:09:13,739
that has the card an nfc cell phone

2643
02:09:13,739 --> 02:09:17,040
I write it I'm going to recharge a peso and that's it

2644
02:09:17,040 --> 02:09:19,139
I will have the balance that I put in

2645
02:09:19,139 --> 02:09:20,820
the system and we said that it is a

2646
02:09:20,820 --> 02:09:22,920
partial modification because in the end

2647
02:09:22,920 --> 02:09:25,860
Can I put a specific value on it?

2648
02:09:25,860 --> 02:09:28,440
the value that I want but I have to

2649
02:09:28,440 --> 02:09:30,900
make a reload take that value and

2650
02:09:30,900 --> 02:09:33,480
I will always have that value, not the

2651
02:09:33,480 --> 02:09:35,040
services in Point because we say that the

2652
02:09:35,040 --> 02:09:36,719
system x has a mobile app that

2653
02:09:36,719 --> 02:09:39,179
It is curiously vulnerable

2654
02:09:39,179 --> 02:09:41,159
mobile app makes about two

2655
02:09:41,159 --> 02:09:43,040
months they updated it

2656
02:09:43,040 --> 02:09:46,199
I thought that it could be

2657
02:09:46,199 --> 02:09:48,300
Fixed this security and it didn't

2658
02:09:48,300 --> 02:09:50,520
it is not made very pretty

2659
02:09:50,520 --> 02:09:52,679
they put a lot of super practical decorations

2660
02:09:52,679 --> 02:09:55,440
very cool very colorful but inside

2661
02:09:55,440 --> 02:09:58,139
continue with security issues

2662
02:09:58,139 --> 02:09:59,699
Z system, as we already saw that it had

2663
02:09:59,699 --> 02:10:01,860
certificate problems on your page

2664
02:10:01,860 --> 02:10:04,560
web and that allows us to obtain

2665
02:10:04,560 --> 02:10:06,300
the query but if I already wanted to do

2666
02:10:06,300 --> 02:10:08,400
another type of attack on that system

2667
02:10:08,400 --> 02:10:10,139
could I get to affect them no

2668
02:10:10,139 --> 02:10:14,219
then some recommendations that

2669
02:10:14,219 --> 02:10:16,920
obviously they do not eliminate the risk because

2670
02:10:16,920 --> 02:10:19,380
So from my point of view and my

2671
02:10:19,380 --> 02:10:21,480
expertise and knowledge we cannot

2672
02:10:21,480 --> 02:10:23,159
eliminate a security risk we can

2673
02:10:23,159 --> 02:10:25,020
mitigate it we can transfer it we can

2674
02:10:25,020 --> 02:10:27,960
accept it but this mitigates us a bit

2675
02:10:27,960 --> 02:10:30,420
what would be the risk with these

2676
02:10:30,420 --> 02:10:32,340
cards no then the first do not use

2677
02:10:32,340 --> 02:10:34,739
the card ID for validation By

2678
02:10:34,739 --> 02:10:37,860
that there are many systems in which I

2679
02:10:37,860 --> 02:10:41,460
I only have access that is validated

2680
02:10:41,460 --> 02:10:43,820
just for the widding for the sample

2681
02:10:43,820 --> 02:10:46,560
Go to a movie theater in Colombia for the

2682
02:10:46,560 --> 02:10:47,940
shows go to an amusement park

2683
02:10:47,940 --> 02:10:50,040
here in Mexico for the sample go to

2684
02:10:50,040 --> 02:10:52,260
parking lots where only wd

2685
02:10:52,260 --> 02:10:55,860
can enter and what about the owner who

2686
02:10:55,860 --> 02:10:59,699
White is something that responds to me

2687
02:10:59,699 --> 02:11:02,099
card doing absolutely nothing OR

2688
02:11:02,099 --> 02:11:05,520
be it the npcs cards or the tags

2689
02:11:05,520 --> 02:11:07,800
liabilities I as a reader send you a wave

2690
02:11:07,800 --> 02:11:09,840
and he is going to answer me with the guaidó

2691
02:11:09,840 --> 02:11:11,400
So if I only use the

2692
02:11:11,400 --> 02:11:14,219
instead of to validate I am already giving the

2693
02:11:14,219 --> 02:11:15,900
information that the card has

2694
02:11:15,900 --> 02:11:19,320
then avoid this validation or this

2695
02:11:19,320 --> 02:11:21,960
identification by only the one who is

2696
02:11:21,960 --> 02:11:24,119
has No now block sectors that

2697
02:11:24,119 --> 02:11:26,880
do not contain data because of the access bids

2698
02:11:26,880 --> 02:11:30,780
I can kill the sectors or kill

2699
02:11:30,780 --> 02:11:33,119
some blocks and sectors of the card

2700
02:11:33,119 --> 02:11:37,020
that prevents them from recovering certain

2701
02:11:37,020 --> 02:11:39,480
information not O that works for

2702
02:11:39,480 --> 02:11:42,060
certain attacks then I say this No

2703
02:11:42,060 --> 02:11:45,000
prevents them from doing it but let's just say

2704
02:11:45,000 --> 02:11:47,460
it makes it a little more difficult for the attacker to

2705
02:11:47,460 --> 02:11:50,040
be able to make it handle control data

2706
02:11:50,040 --> 02:11:51,480
by conditions of access to the blocks

2707
02:11:51,480 --> 02:11:54,360
and sectors of that is handled by the system and

2708
02:11:54,360 --> 02:11:56,820
where we saw that he actually had

2709
02:11:56,820 --> 02:11:58,800
lock for read or lock for

2710
02:11:58,800 --> 02:12:02,159
writing where we could have a

2711
02:12:02,159 --> 02:12:05,159
security layer not incorporate

2712
02:12:05,159 --> 02:12:06,960
coding mechanisms and encryption

2713
02:12:06,960 --> 02:12:09,000
of the information it is understood that

2714
02:12:09,000 --> 02:12:11,940
Obviously encryption consumes my

2715
02:12:11,940 --> 02:12:14,219
resources consume me time But at least

2716
02:12:14,219 --> 02:12:17,880
do not store the information in clear of

2717
02:12:17,880 --> 02:12:19,560
way an attacker has the

2718
02:12:19,560 --> 02:12:21,840
information and cannot reach

2719
02:12:21,840 --> 02:12:24,179
understand it and much less to modify it

2720
02:12:24,179 --> 02:12:27,420
why? Because I apply ideally

2721
02:12:27,420 --> 02:12:30,960
would be a cipher But at least one type

2722
02:12:30,960 --> 02:12:33,480
encryption that prevents the

2723
02:12:33,480 --> 02:12:35,159
attacker may directly have

2724
02:12:35,159 --> 02:12:37,580
the information as such

2725
02:12:37,580 --> 02:12:39,780
Another solution would be to change

2726
02:12:39,780 --> 02:12:41,280
labels with a higher level of

2727
02:12:41,280 --> 02:12:42,080
security

2728
02:12:42,080 --> 02:12:44,639
exist on the market for the same

2729
02:12:44,639 --> 02:12:46,739
manufacturer and other major manufacturers

2730
02:12:46,739 --> 02:12:48,300
security but obviously This

2731
02:12:48,300 --> 02:12:50,239
would imply a cost

2732
02:12:50,239 --> 02:12:53,719
in time a cost in resources a cost

2733
02:12:53,719 --> 02:12:57,239
very high that I could not do the

2734
02:12:57,239 --> 02:12:58,040
solution

2735
02:12:58,040 --> 02:12:59,840
not ideal

2736
02:12:59,840 --> 02:13:02,760
for the part of the

2737
02:13:02,760 --> 02:13:05,159
the en points for example do

2738
02:13:05,159 --> 02:13:07,560
validations by captcha that no

2739
02:13:07,560 --> 02:13:10,260
can I make sweeps of all

2740
02:13:10,260 --> 02:13:13,619
cards because here with the system x lo

2741
02:13:13,619 --> 02:13:16,860
What we did was mount a Script or about

2742
02:13:16,860 --> 02:13:19,739
a VPN over some proxies over some

2743
02:13:19,739 --> 02:13:21,960
things in particular in a way that

2744
02:13:21,960 --> 02:13:24,659
we had an attack for about 3-4 hours in

2745
02:13:24,659 --> 02:13:26,520
where we were getting information

2746
02:13:26,520 --> 02:13:29,579
of the cards and at no time

2747
02:13:29,579 --> 02:13:31,860
gave us an alert at no time

2748
02:13:31,860 --> 02:13:34,320
they blocked at no time was there any

2749
02:13:34,320 --> 02:13:37,380
control that said there is an intruder

2750
02:13:37,380 --> 02:13:39,420
getting information from my system

2751
02:13:39,420 --> 02:13:42,480
So I think if we have these

2752
02:13:42,480 --> 02:13:43,980
services on bridges We also have to

2753
02:13:43,980 --> 02:13:46,320
provide a level of security that allows the

2754
02:13:46,320 --> 02:13:47,900
user then have

2755
02:13:47,900 --> 02:13:52,079
the the feeling of really being

2756
02:13:52,079 --> 02:13:54,780
sure not and the last thing is they will do

2757
02:13:54,780 --> 02:13:56,280
vulnerability scan

2758
02:13:56,280 --> 02:13:57,840
periodically the services in Point

2759
02:13:57,840 --> 02:14:00,320
because many times the systems are

2760
02:14:00,320 --> 02:14:03,900
they work we want it now we want it

2761
02:14:03,900 --> 02:14:06,540
leave because the business wants it or

2762
02:14:06,540 --> 02:14:08,760
because the president said or because

2763
02:14:08,760 --> 02:14:10,260
so-and-so is the one in charge and

2764
02:14:10,260 --> 02:14:12,020
you want me to come out no

2765
02:14:12,020 --> 02:14:14,460
many companies pass I have found

2766
02:14:14,460 --> 02:14:16,739
many of these topics. So we

2767
02:14:16,739 --> 02:14:18,480
as security we will always do it

2768
02:14:18,480 --> 02:14:20,219
bad we are always those who do not leave

2769
02:14:20,219 --> 02:14:21,900
that things work that we do not leave

2770
02:14:21,900 --> 02:14:23,579
that they come out but I think it is

2771
02:14:23,579 --> 02:14:26,040
important at the company level because having

2772
02:14:26,040 --> 02:14:27,659
this type of analysis

2773
02:14:27,659 --> 02:14:30,420
vulnerabilities no so i tried no

2774
02:14:30,420 --> 02:14:34,139
go so long because well there we

2775
02:14:34,139 --> 02:14:36,480
they took a few minutes from us and this would be

2776
02:14:36,480 --> 02:14:38,040
all the information I have for

2777
02:14:38,040 --> 02:14:40,340
present to you today then

2778
02:14:40,340 --> 02:14:42,960
Thank you all if you have doubts then

2779
02:14:42,960 --> 02:14:45,000
let's answer them

2780
02:14:45,000 --> 02:14:47,040
Don't worry, Sergio, we're going to respect you.

2781
02:14:47,040 --> 02:14:48,440
your time

2782
02:14:48,440 --> 02:14:51,719
We are aware that at the beginning of the

2783
02:14:51,719 --> 02:14:53,699
event always consume some

2784
02:14:53,699 --> 02:14:56,219
minutes and there is no mess So we have

2785
02:14:56,219 --> 02:14:58,980
several questions in Charles are

2786
02:14:58,980 --> 02:15:01,020
sending the link so they know which one

2787
02:15:01,020 --> 02:15:03,179
is the system where the

2788
02:15:03,179 --> 02:15:04,880
questions and

2789
02:15:04,880 --> 02:15:07,139
they tell us

2790
02:15:07,139 --> 02:15:09,179
you were able to bypass the validation system

2791
02:15:09,179 --> 02:15:11,699
so that the card is not blocked when

2792
02:15:11,699 --> 02:15:13,820
weather

2793
02:15:14,780 --> 02:15:17,639
can you repeat the question yes

2794
02:15:17,639 --> 02:15:20,639
Did you manage to jump or alloy in so that

2795
02:15:20,639 --> 02:15:23,880
the card over time is not blocked

2796
02:15:23,880 --> 02:15:26,340
well we didn't test about much

2797
02:15:26,340 --> 02:15:29,520
time we did not test in another month

2798
02:15:29,520 --> 02:15:32,460
or less and the cards did not have

2799
02:15:32,460 --> 02:15:35,400
no problem now if we don't know

2800
02:15:35,400 --> 02:15:37,679
blocked some cards that we had

2801
02:15:37,679 --> 02:15:40,760
used about six months ago

2802
02:15:40,760 --> 02:15:43,139
that they were from the old cards of the

2803
02:15:43,139 --> 02:15:45,980
system that were not even

2804
02:15:45,980 --> 02:15:48,239
centralized in the database But

2805
02:15:48,239 --> 02:15:51,360
in the end we bought cards and

2806
02:15:51,360 --> 02:15:52,619
we could do all the attacks then

2807
02:15:52,619 --> 02:15:54,179
I can easily buy a card

2808
02:15:54,179 --> 02:15:56,400
that is worth 10 pesos if they block it for me

2809
02:15:56,400 --> 02:15:59,900
How do I buy another one and make the variation?

2810
02:15:59,900 --> 02:16:03,300
Ready or have cards that change the ID

2811
02:16:03,300 --> 02:16:05,900
and do the process constantly

2812
02:16:05,900 --> 02:16:08,639
Yes, exactly

2813
02:16:08,639 --> 02:16:12,360
I can't I can use you clients and

2814
02:16:12,360 --> 02:16:13,980
I consume the balances of them To

2815
02:16:13,980 --> 02:16:16,579
not affect

2816
02:16:16,739 --> 02:16:21,179
for the line, well, ask Juan, yes

2817
02:16:21,179 --> 02:16:24,900
they make experiments with the zero to

2818
02:16:24,900 --> 02:16:28,880
this type of audit

2819
02:16:28,880 --> 02:16:33,478
a portable device to have other

2820
02:16:33,478 --> 02:16:37,200
technologies no I don't know it I say all

2821
02:16:37,200 --> 02:16:39,718
at the beginning all the tests

2822
02:16:39,718 --> 02:16:41,638
we did with this white reader who

2823
02:16:41,638 --> 02:16:44,700
I showed them later we already had access to

2824
02:16:44,700 --> 02:16:47,939
a complete dependesting kit that

2825
02:16:47,939 --> 02:16:51,359
we bought with the 401 and I say I have used

2826
02:16:51,359 --> 02:16:54,718
tests with the chameleon mini in access to

2827
02:16:54,718 --> 02:16:55,920
places that have given me

2828
02:16:55,920 --> 02:16:59,459
credentials for my my works and me

2829
02:16:59,459 --> 02:17:01,679
works without any problem

2830
02:17:01,679 --> 02:17:04,558
Ok but then I can answer the

2831
02:17:04,558 --> 02:17:07,200
question and indeed Although well

2832
02:17:07,200 --> 02:17:08,879
select what has tried is the

2833
02:17:08,879 --> 02:17:10,558
device would work for this type

2834
02:17:10,558 --> 02:17:13,439
of things and and it would work very well because

2835
02:17:13,439 --> 02:17:15,420
because he has access let's say

2836
02:17:15,420 --> 02:17:16,978
compatibility with technologies

2837
02:17:16,978 --> 02:17:19,978
has told us and the possibility of flying and

2838
02:17:19,978 --> 02:17:22,218
the possibility of it being portable

2839
02:17:22,218 --> 02:17:25,379
it will work it will work yes even

2840
02:17:25,379 --> 02:17:27,120
I go there that there are some awards with

2841
02:17:27,120 --> 02:17:29,099
some new devices that are

2842
02:17:29,099 --> 02:17:32,040
interesting Not clear the bomber cup

2843
02:17:32,040 --> 02:17:34,620
It would also be useful for that, we are going to

2844
02:17:34,620 --> 02:17:36,359
see the last talk today is

2845
02:17:36,359 --> 02:17:39,420
about the guys who created this

2846
02:17:39,420 --> 02:17:41,519
hardware device and also

2847
02:17:41,519 --> 02:17:44,820
would allow emulate clone and do this

2848
02:17:44,820 --> 02:17:46,879
kind of things

2849
02:17:46,879 --> 02:17:50,000
we are one last question away

2850
02:17:50,000 --> 02:17:52,160
[Music]

2851
02:17:52,160 --> 02:17:54,660
analysis is done at the terminals

2852
02:17:54,660 --> 02:17:56,780
sale

2853
02:17:57,500 --> 02:18:00,299
directly with the sales terminal No

2854
02:18:00,299 --> 02:18:03,240
because we didn't have access yes what

2855
02:18:03,240 --> 02:18:05,580
we did was what we were limited

2856
02:18:05,580 --> 02:18:09,179
we as end user really do

2857
02:18:09,179 --> 02:18:12,120
we try to contact them if we try

2858
02:18:12,120 --> 02:18:14,519
tell them Hey then let's do something come on

2859
02:18:14,519 --> 02:18:16,679
we teach them we tell them give us a little

2860
02:18:16,679 --> 02:18:18,780
more access. But at least in these

2861
02:18:18,780 --> 02:18:21,120
three systems I did not have an experience

2862
02:18:21,120 --> 02:18:25,080
obviously already at a private level to do

2863
02:18:25,080 --> 02:18:27,660
some a test for other companies in

2864
02:18:27,660 --> 02:18:29,820
a destination gave us all the technology

2865
02:18:29,820 --> 02:18:31,459
give the terminals

2866
02:18:31,459 --> 02:18:33,599
give us the labels and

2867
02:18:33,599 --> 02:18:36,120
we do the whole thing even

2868
02:18:36,120 --> 02:18:38,280
with different labels I don't know the path

2869
02:18:38,280 --> 02:18:39,780
if you know them

2870
02:18:39,780 --> 02:18:43,219
we had also worked on it

2871
02:18:44,120 --> 02:18:46,799
ready that answered another question that you

2872
02:18:46,799 --> 02:18:48,959
they are doing and if they exist in the field

2873
02:18:48,959 --> 02:18:52,260
other systems and other systems that do not

2874
02:18:52,260 --> 02:18:54,898
have actually investigated there is a

2875
02:18:54,898 --> 02:18:57,299
wide variety of technologies much for

2876
02:18:57,299 --> 02:18:59,040
do really

2877
02:18:59,040 --> 02:19:02,160
Ready now with that Sergio who is going to send

2878
02:19:02,160 --> 02:19:03,840
ask questions online so that

2879
02:19:03,840 --> 02:19:05,160
I can answer them in your networks

2880
02:19:05,160 --> 02:19:08,340
social these social networks are

2881
02:19:08,340 --> 02:19:11,820
Putting in the chat right now Yes

2882
02:19:11,820 --> 02:19:14,700
they are not putting her in the chat he is a

2883
02:19:14,700 --> 02:19:17,820
little time that they don't take long to put them on

2884
02:19:17,820 --> 02:19:19,138
I leave the public so you can

2885
02:19:19,138 --> 02:19:21,058
fire and we can

2886
02:19:21,058 --> 02:19:22,978
continue with the next

2887
02:19:22,978 --> 02:19:24,859

collaborate even for projects that

2897
02:19:43,019 --> 02:19:44,459
have we can work together

2898
02:19:44,459 --> 02:19:46,138

Salvador who is going to talk to us a little

2904
02:19:58,320 --> 02:20:01,160
about the investigations in the Dark web

2905
02:20:01,160 --> 02:20:04,800
Salvador, you are already there, right, yes

2906

here we are good El Salvador I leave you

2907
02:20:07,439 --> 02:20:09,500
the public then so you can

2908
02:20:09,500 --> 02:20:11,700
explain a little about how to do

2909
02:20:11,700 --> 02:20:14,340
research in the darpuestas is worth

2910
02:20:14,340 --> 02:20:16,380
thank you very much can you confirm that

2911
02:20:16,380 --> 02:20:18,600
I'm already on my screen fine

2912
02:20:18,600 --> 02:20:20,460
in this event you are seeing your

2913
02:20:20,460 --> 02:20:24,180
screen well perfect then let's

2914
02:20:24,180 --> 02:20:25,979
start welcome my name is

2915
02:20:25,979 --> 02:20:27,359
Salvador and today we will be

2916
02:20:27,359 --> 02:20:29,340
talking about investigations in the bar

2917
02:20:29,340 --> 02:20:31,800
website before starting the conversation

2918
02:20:31,800 --> 02:20:33,359
I want to tell a little story of

2919
02:20:33,359 --> 02:20:35,760
something that happened to me a few years ago

2920
02:20:35,760 --> 02:20:37,620
browsing the dark web we always

2921
02:20:37,620 --> 02:20:39,180
They say that this is a terrible place

2922
02:20:39,180 --> 02:20:41,040
full of bad people where only

2923
02:20:41,040 --> 02:20:43,979
we are going to find illegal things and things

2924
02:20:43,979 --> 02:20:45,899
bad, however, I leave you this little one

2925
02:20:45,899 --> 02:20:47,939
history that is a post that I found

2926
02:20:47,939 --> 02:20:50,939
in a very common forum of the Dark web

2927
02:20:50,939 --> 02:20:52,399
where

2928
02:20:52,399 --> 02:20:55,200
fishing issues are normally discussed

2929
02:20:55,200 --> 02:20:57,720
carding malware scam themes only

2930
02:20:57,720 --> 02:20:59,640
illegal however see this

2931
02:20:59,640 --> 02:21:01,800
publication is a publication that is

2932
02:21:01,800 --> 02:21:03,960
a how to use engineering guide

2933
02:21:03,960 --> 02:21:06,479
Social to get food for your

2934
02:21:06,479 --> 02:21:08,640
dogs or how do you leave it here for your

2935
02:21:08,640 --> 02:21:10,220
babies then

2936
02:21:10,220 --> 02:21:12,600
I was very much against what we

2937
02:21:12,600 --> 02:21:14,819
They usually teach that it is to wash the web inside

2938
02:21:14,819 --> 02:21:16,500
of what is usually the taboo that

2939
02:21:16,500 --> 02:21:18,240
Is this place full of bad things?

2940
02:21:18,240 --> 02:21:19,859
is one that even goes so far as to demonstrate

2941
02:21:19,859 --> 02:21:22,859
some empathy which it demonstrates

2942
02:21:22,859 --> 02:21:24,420
that is not true it is not true that that

2943
02:21:24,420 --> 02:21:25,920
all we have found here is

2944
02:21:25,920 --> 02:21:27,720
merely illegal they are bad things

2945
02:21:27,720 --> 02:21:31,160
so apart from these issues

2946
02:21:31,160 --> 02:21:34,319
monetary or illegal than other reason

2947
02:21:34,319 --> 02:21:35,939
we would have to be users

2948
02:21:35,939 --> 02:21:38,100
common laundering web so that I leave you

2949
02:21:38,100 --> 02:21:40,560
a small a small example is a

2950
02:21:40,560 --> 02:21:43,640
personal site of a person in which

2951
02:21:43,640 --> 02:21:46,260
It is their way of protesting against the

2952
02:21:46,260 --> 02:21:48,120
censorship and against espionage that

2953
02:21:48,120 --> 02:21:49,500
arrive who carry out the great

2954
02:21:49,500 --> 02:21:52,620
corporations and is inviting us to

2955
02:21:52,620 --> 02:21:54,240
we also join this

2956
02:21:54,240 --> 02:21:56,280
small movement creating our

2957
02:21:56,280 --> 02:21:59,460
own page and becoming users of

2958
02:21:59,460 --> 02:22:01,859
shape of shape like that of the dark web

2959
02:22:01,859 --> 02:22:04,319
Another example is this project in which

2960
02:22:04,319 --> 02:22:06,899
are using so to speak the

2961
02:22:06,899 --> 02:22:09,060
Maker movement to create products

2962
02:22:09,060 --> 02:22:12,240
more accessible doctors then many

2963
02:22:12,240 --> 02:22:14,479
projects like this or just

2964
02:22:14,479 --> 02:22:16,140
large knowledge centers

2965
02:22:16,140 --> 02:22:18,060
find their home on the dark web now

2966
02:22:18,060 --> 02:22:20,280
which is a place where they can grow

2967
02:22:20,280 --> 02:22:22,560
where can you find a good one

2968
02:22:22,560 --> 02:22:25,800
community without worrying about all this

2969
02:22:25,800 --> 02:22:27,720
censorship that we usually find in the

2970
02:22:27,720 --> 02:22:30,120
surface network. So leaving this of

2971
02:22:30,120 --> 02:22:33,479
next we can enter more to the topic My

2972
02:22:33,479 --> 02:22:36,000
name is Salvador I am an operator in

2973
02:22:36,000 --> 02:22:38,100
Said Falls I am also the founder and

2974
02:22:38,100 --> 02:22:40,020
jacabox community organizer

2975
02:22:40,020 --> 02:22:42,479
Mexico There we get together sometimes at

2976
02:22:42,479 --> 02:22:46,020
month to be hacking and I know that the

2977
02:22:46,020 --> 02:22:47,939
websex guys are patrons of

2978
02:22:47,939 --> 02:22:49,200
this event they are also from

2979
02:22:49,200 --> 02:22:51,479
our sponsors then a

2980
02:22:51,479 --> 02:22:52,439
very big thanks to them for

2981
02:22:52,439 --> 02:22:54,780
to be supporting so much talent

2982
02:22:54,780 --> 02:22:57,840
and finally I am also a volunteer

2983
02:22:57,840 --> 02:22:59,640
dosing i think you have been listening

2984
02:22:59,640 --> 02:23:01,319
one of the ones of the talks that

2985
02:23:01,319 --> 02:23:02,899
there have been before

2986
02:23:02,899 --> 02:23:04,979
have been hearing a lot of what you already

2987
02:23:04,979 --> 02:23:08,939
se losín So I have used these

2988
02:23:08,939 --> 02:23:11,280
skills to collaborate

2989
02:23:11,280 --> 02:23:14,220
organizations where what they do is

2990
02:23:14,220 --> 02:23:17,040
Look for topics of social impact on

2991
02:23:17,040 --> 02:23:18,899
all where I've been is in the

2992
02:23:18,899 --> 02:23:20,040
search for missing persons

2993
02:23:20,040 --> 02:23:22,500
So if you are interested in knowing how

2994
02:23:22,500 --> 02:23:25,040
can use these abilities

2995
02:23:25,040 --> 02:23:27,660
cybersecurity for topics like this or

2996
02:23:27,660 --> 02:23:29,939
want to learn more than 100 by the end of

2997
02:23:29,939 --> 02:23:31,319
the talk will be leaving you a list

2998
02:23:31,319 --> 02:23:33,600
of resources where they can learn more about

2999
02:23:33,600 --> 02:23:35,280
this and join these these

3000
02:23:35,280 --> 02:23:37,260
organizations then

3001
02:23:37,260 --> 02:23:40,500
We are going to enter the subject we are going to be

3002
02:23:40,500 --> 02:23:42,479
talking about 40 minutes of what is the

3003
02:23:42,479 --> 02:23:44,040
Dark web then we must start

3004
02:23:44,040 --> 02:23:47,640
leaving Clear that it is laundering web we can

3005
02:23:47,640 --> 02:23:49,979
to think that there are three levels we have the

3006
02:23:49,979 --> 02:23:53,340
cleaner we have the Deep web and the Dark

3007
02:23:53,340 --> 02:23:55,140
web the terms are usually used

3008
02:23:55,140 --> 02:23:58,080
dip and dar web interchangeably

3009
02:23:58,080 --> 02:24:01,100
as if they were the same but they are not

3010
02:24:01,100 --> 02:24:03,240
when we are when we talk about the

3011
02:24:03,240 --> 02:24:05,100
Deep web we are talking about the level that

3012
02:24:05,100 --> 02:24:07,439
is below the web surface or

3013
02:24:07,439 --> 02:24:10,260
the clearned at this level of the network

3014
02:24:10,260 --> 02:24:12,600
we are still traceable no

3015
02:24:12,600 --> 02:24:14,880
our actions and our directions

3016
02:24:14,880 --> 02:24:17,040
and our identity is still

3017
02:24:17,040 --> 02:24:18,479
breathable however we are talking

3018
02:24:18,479 --> 02:24:21,359
of sites to which they are inaccessible

3019
02:24:21,359 --> 02:24:23,180
through our normal search engines

3020
02:24:23,180 --> 02:24:26,760
this given that there are barriers that limit

3021
02:24:26,760 --> 02:24:29,100
access to these web pages are

3022
02:24:29,100 --> 02:24:32,220
barriers can be login tablets or

3023
02:24:32,220 --> 02:24:33,960
just private sites we broadcast

3024
02:24:33,960 --> 02:24:36,240
some kind of key to access

3025
02:24:36,240 --> 02:24:39,240
we can think that by accessing

3026
02:24:39,240 --> 02:24:41,640
our Facebook discord profile or

3027
02:24:41,640 --> 02:24:43,859
our Netflix account we already

3028
02:24:43,859 --> 02:24:46,800
we are inside the web because of

3029
02:24:46,800 --> 02:24:50,280
new this our our account is not

3030
02:24:50,280 --> 02:24:52,560
accessible is not indexable That is, it is not

3031
02:24:52,560 --> 02:24:53,700
accessible through a search engine

3032
02:24:53,700 --> 02:24:55,979
we can Search my account for example and

3033
02:24:55,979 --> 02:24:58,380
It would open us directly How to access

3034
02:24:58,380 --> 02:25:00,540
to our account we have this limitation

3035
02:25:00,540 --> 02:25:02,700
what is this barrier from access now

3036
02:25:02,700 --> 02:25:05,340
side of lavar web we are talking about

3037
02:25:05,340 --> 02:25:08,160
a network where the central theme is the

3038
02:25:08,160 --> 02:25:12,240
anonymity not knowing who is who and what

3039
02:25:12,240 --> 02:25:14,460
more important is that already what divides

3040
02:25:14,460 --> 02:25:16,319
the Deep web to launder the web is already

3041
02:25:16,319 --> 02:25:17,880
You need specialized software to

3042
02:25:17,880 --> 02:25:20,939
access this and give web by

3043
02:25:20,939 --> 02:25:22,640
nature

3044
02:25:22,640 --> 02:25:24,960
we are talking about non-indexed sites

3045
02:25:24,960 --> 02:25:26,280
i.e. there is no database

3046
02:25:26,280 --> 02:25:28,460
centralized where you already have domains

3047
02:25:28,460 --> 02:25:30,420
let's forget we can forget everything

3048
02:25:30,420 --> 02:25:33,420
what are the domains and where we

3049
02:25:33,420 --> 02:25:34,859
We can simply a search for

3050
02:25:34,859 --> 02:25:36,660
Google and we can get results in

3051
02:25:36,660 --> 02:25:40,080
the web bar doesn't work like that Now the

3052
02:25:40,080 --> 02:25:42,720
give web normally we only think

3053
02:25:42,720 --> 02:25:45,000
around Torres the largest without

3054
02:25:45,000 --> 02:25:47,880
However, it is not the only one, there are others.

3055
02:25:47,880 --> 02:25:49,920
other web bar projects such as

3056
02:25:49,920 --> 02:25:53,100
are the cirunet laitupi or the freemet without

3057
02:25:53,100 --> 02:25:54,600
however we are leaving today

3058
02:25:54,600 --> 02:25:57,680
to be focusing on what Thor is and

3059
02:25:57,680 --> 02:26:00,420
environment the links end have the

3060
02:26:00,420 --> 02:26:02,100
onion point extension then today

3061
02:26:02,100 --> 02:26:04,500
we are going to be referring to the

3062
02:26:04,500 --> 02:26:08,120
web sites like onions

3063
02:26:08,120 --> 02:26:10,439
we need the software

3064
02:26:10,439 --> 02:26:11,640
special that I had mentioned

3065
02:26:11,640 --> 02:26:14,479
previously then

3066
02:26:14,479 --> 02:26:16,319
we need to create our lab

3067
02:26:16,319 --> 02:26:17,819
this laboratory has to be thought

3068
02:26:17,819 --> 02:26:20,100
in three things to give us access to our

3069
02:26:20,100 --> 02:26:22,140
security and our privacy to

3070
02:26:22,140 --> 02:26:24,600
create our laboratory we can go by

3071
02:26:24,600 --> 02:26:26,460
two paths these are not mutual

3072
02:26:26,460 --> 02:26:28,859
exclusive we can combine them we have

3073
02:26:28,859 --> 02:26:31,620
the virtual side where we can make use

3074
02:26:31,620 --> 02:26:33,600
of some operating system such as

3075
02:26:33,600 --> 02:26:36,359
Tails unix or even docker already have

3076
02:26:36,359 --> 02:26:39,120
good containers that serve to

3077
02:26:39,120 --> 02:26:40,620
root our traffic through

3078
02:26:40,620 --> 02:26:43,740
Thor or the physical side we can use

3079
02:26:43,740 --> 02:26:45,780
a cheap computer like a

3080
02:26:45,780 --> 02:26:47,399
raspberry we can have a bps

3081
02:26:47,399 --> 02:26:50,760
just a digitalusion dronet or

3082
02:26:50,760 --> 02:26:52,380
a disposable machine that we are no longer

3083
02:26:52,380 --> 02:26:54,540
using and I tell them These are not

3084
02:26:54,540 --> 02:26:56,040
mutually exclusive i can by

3085
02:26:56,040 --> 02:26:58,859
example running a container

3086
02:26:58,859 --> 02:27:01,020
broker containers in one bps or

3087
02:27:01,020 --> 02:27:03,240
be using on a computer

3088
02:27:03,240 --> 02:27:06,780
disposable homix So what's the

3089
02:27:06,780 --> 02:27:07,560
better

3090
02:27:07,560 --> 02:27:09,359
the best is the one that suits the

3091
02:27:09,359 --> 02:27:10,680
resources you already have and your

3092
02:27:10,680 --> 02:27:11,939
needs So not all of us have

3093
02:27:11,939 --> 02:27:13,680
the necessary resources to be

3094
02:27:13,680 --> 02:27:15,780
paying for a cloud computer month

3095
02:27:15,780 --> 02:27:17,280
with month or we have one

3096
02:27:17,280 --> 02:27:19,200
disposable computer that has the

3097
02:27:19,200 --> 02:27:20,460
resources needed to adapt

3098
02:27:20,460 --> 02:27:24,420
virtualizing unix then what goes away

3099
02:27:24,420 --> 02:27:26,580
to adapt to you is what adapts to the

3100
02:27:26,580 --> 02:27:29,180
resources that you have

3101
02:27:29,340 --> 02:27:31,260
and we are going to start now with one of

3102
02:27:31,260 --> 02:27:33,240
my favorite parts which are the

3103
02:27:33,240 --> 02:27:36,000
methodology to be able to do our

3104
02:27:36,000 --> 02:27:37,680
investigations we need to have a

3105
02:27:37,680 --> 02:27:40,319
Clear methodology because it does not

3106
02:27:40,319 --> 02:27:41,819
we know how we are going to look for it, we don't

3107
02:27:41,819 --> 02:27:44,460
we will be able to find then for me

3108
02:27:44,460 --> 02:27:45,600
The methodology starts with the first

3109
02:27:45,600 --> 02:27:47,280
step is to identify the needs

3110
02:27:47,280 --> 02:27:49,500
that we have we are not going to enter

3111
02:27:49,500 --> 02:27:51,020
the deep web

3112
02:27:51,020 --> 02:27:55,020
this if we are going to start to start

3113
02:27:55,020 --> 02:27:57,780
waste resources and time otherwise

3114
02:27:57,780 --> 02:28:00,180
we have a clear need

3115
02:28:00,180 --> 02:28:01,640
needs can be for example

3116
02:28:01,640 --> 02:28:04,680
check if there was a to go to League for

3117
02:28:04,680 --> 02:28:06,479
example to me or a client dropped a

3118
02:28:06,479 --> 02:28:08,640
ransomware attack I want to know if

3119
02:28:08,640 --> 02:28:10,620
if any information was leaked together

3120
02:28:10,620 --> 02:28:12,300
with that attack then i can visit

3121
02:28:12,300 --> 02:28:14,819
the web bar and see if there is any sale

3122
02:28:14,819 --> 02:28:18,000
from my client's database and see

3123
02:28:18,000 --> 02:28:19,620
if yes it is being sold and what is it

3124
02:28:19,620 --> 02:28:21,899
is selling I want to take

3125
02:28:21,899 --> 02:28:23,819
cape tretilet activities

3126
02:28:23,819 --> 02:28:26,220
intelligence or three conti and be watching

3127
02:28:26,220 --> 02:28:27,899
for example what are the new groups

3128
02:28:27,899 --> 02:28:31,020
of ransomware that are yes to the new siro

3129
02:28:31,020 --> 02:28:33,020
you see they are advertising

3130
02:28:33,020 --> 02:28:36,060
if there are trends of attacks on my country or

3131
02:28:36,060 --> 02:28:37,080
to my industry and start bringing

3132
02:28:37,080 --> 02:28:39,540
preventive activities also if

3133
02:28:39,540 --> 02:28:41,040
I want to investigate criminal activity

3134
02:28:41,040 --> 02:28:44,899
There is simply a group of activity

3135
02:28:44,899 --> 02:28:47,280
and that we want to do an investigation

3136
02:28:47,280 --> 02:28:50,160
about it or determine the truth of

3137
02:28:50,160 --> 02:28:53,359
something for example that

3138
02:28:53,819 --> 02:28:56,700
in a social network let's say in a

3139
02:28:56,700 --> 02:28:58,620
newspaper let's say something Comfort Chan

3140
02:28:58,620 --> 02:29:01,560
readdicted we see that it is published that

3141
02:29:01,560 --> 02:29:04,020
there is a group selling it is not

3142
02:29:04,020 --> 02:29:05,819
false identities and passports in

3143
02:29:05,819 --> 02:29:08,040
our country so here I want

3144
02:29:08,040 --> 02:29:11,280
determine if it is true that this that

3145
02:29:11,280 --> 02:29:13,200
is union that this group selling this

3146
02:29:13,200 --> 02:29:15,780
exists and two How certain is it that the

3147
02:29:15,780 --> 02:29:17,640
is selling because as we will see in

3148
02:29:17,640 --> 02:29:20,399
this talk the dark web is full of

3149
02:29:20,399 --> 02:29:24,140
descamps is full of frauds So

3150
02:29:24,140 --> 02:29:26,399
we want to determine how

3151
02:29:26,399 --> 02:29:28,620
Real is that this is being sold yes

3152
02:29:28,620 --> 02:29:29,939
Are you interested in reading more?

3153
02:29:29,939 --> 02:29:31,680
regarding the new models of

3154
02:29:31,680 --> 02:29:33,420
business and profitability

3155
02:29:33,420 --> 02:29:36,120
business in the web bar there is a reading

3156
02:29:36,120 --> 02:29:37,500
very good that I leave them here that is

3157
02:29:37,500 --> 02:29:39,300
without a doubt web profit that investigates more in

3158
02:29:39,300 --> 02:29:40,859
this topic then once we

3159
02:29:40,859 --> 02:29:43,080
we have our need

3160
02:29:43,080 --> 02:29:45,660
what follows is to define Our objective

3161
02:29:45,660 --> 02:29:48,180
let's see the case of deiralink I want

3162
02:29:48,180 --> 02:29:51,240
know one if something is leaking two

3163
02:29:51,240 --> 02:29:54,359
what is leaking and three how

3164
02:29:54,359 --> 02:29:55,859
probably someone already has

3165
02:29:55,859 --> 02:29:59,399
bought then This is my goal of

3166
02:29:59,399 --> 02:30:01,260
there our research can take

3167
02:30:01,260 --> 02:30:03,120
two paths depending on the

3168
02:30:03,120 --> 02:30:04,439
experience or the time we have already

3169
02:30:04,439 --> 02:30:06,479
conducting research activities

3170
02:30:06,479 --> 02:30:08,819
in the web bar if we already have a

3171
02:30:08,819 --> 02:30:10,260
while doing this we already have our

3172
02:30:10,260 --> 02:30:12,660
trusted trusted site let's

3173
02:30:12,660 --> 02:30:15,000
visit our noblexpage a noblex

3174
02:30:15,000 --> 02:30:17,100
base is a database that we

3175
02:30:17,100 --> 02:30:19,620
we create with the sites that we

3176
02:30:19,620 --> 02:30:22,020
We are investigating what they are from

3177
02:30:22,020 --> 02:30:23,939
trust not the sites that where we have

3178
02:30:23,939 --> 02:30:25,319
found good results that already

3179
02:30:25,319 --> 02:30:27,420
we know they are true they are

3180
02:30:27,420 --> 02:30:28,920
stable and so we like to investigate

3181
02:30:28,920 --> 02:30:33,080
in them if we are new

3182
02:30:33,080 --> 02:30:35,880
in this or we just have to make a

3183
02:30:35,880 --> 02:30:38,160
research that is a bit out of the ordinary

3184
02:30:38,160 --> 02:30:40,080
area that we usually investigate we are going to

3185
02:30:40,080 --> 02:30:41,280
start making our discovery

3186
02:30:41,280 --> 02:30:43,560
of sites, that is, investigating the

3187
02:30:43,560 --> 02:30:46,560
onions that are not useful for our

3188
02:30:46,560 --> 02:30:47,880
research

3189
02:30:47,880 --> 02:30:50,580
once we have our unions of

3190
02:30:50,580 --> 02:30:51,899
trust our unions that we

3191
02:30:51,899 --> 02:30:53,580
they seem interesting for the topic let's go

3192
02:30:53,580 --> 02:30:55,920
to do data collection

3193
02:30:55,920 --> 02:30:57,600
data collection we are talking about

3194
02:30:57,600 --> 02:31:00,180
that you have to store user photos

3195
02:31:00,180 --> 02:31:02,780
publications

3196
02:31:02,780 --> 02:31:05,220
titles information that come in the

3197
02:31:05,220 --> 02:31:07,439
source code the fabycon everything

3198
02:31:07,439 --> 02:31:09,060
we can collect what we can do

3199
02:31:09,060 --> 02:31:11,520
useful in our investigation once

3200
02:31:11,520 --> 02:31:12,960
that we have your data we are going to

3201
02:31:12,960 --> 02:31:15,120
analyze and later we will extract

3202
02:31:15,120 --> 02:31:17,460
conclusions, that is, if you are

3203
02:31:17,460 --> 02:31:18,840
selling information is not being

3204
02:31:18,840 --> 02:31:22,560
selling information and from this

3205
02:31:22,560 --> 02:31:24,319
we are going to

3206
02:31:24,319 --> 02:31:26,220
restart our investigation

3207
02:31:26,220 --> 02:31:28,080
such investigations usually take a

3208
02:31:28,080 --> 02:31:30,060
cyclical process, that is, once I

3209
02:31:30,060 --> 02:31:31,620
I found it

3210
02:31:31,620 --> 02:31:34,080
sites that were useful to me I could

3211
02:31:34,080 --> 02:31:35,640
have already answered my question

3212
02:31:35,640 --> 02:31:37,979
original but this one is not new

3213
02:31:37,979 --> 02:31:40,080
sites gave me new information that

3214
02:31:40,080 --> 02:31:42,000
It leads me to define two objectives

3215
02:31:42,000 --> 02:31:44,040
So my research can come to

3216
02:31:44,040 --> 02:31:46,140
make a cyclist and something that I recommend

3217
02:31:46,140 --> 02:31:48,120
a lot and that we will talk later

3218
02:31:48,120 --> 02:31:50,819
of this is growing its double Always

3219
02:31:50,819 --> 02:31:52,520
all the sites they are finding

3220
02:31:52,520 --> 02:31:55,140
keep them store it in your nolex you see

3221
02:31:55,140 --> 02:31:58,020
and for that preferably for that

3222
02:31:58,020 --> 02:31:59,819
can say that their research was

3223
02:31:59,819 --> 02:32:02,520
successful take into account as a criterion

3224
02:32:02,520 --> 02:32:05,819
he did grow his name

3225
02:32:05,819 --> 02:32:08,160
and here I have classified four types of

3226
02:32:08,160 --> 02:32:10,460
research

3227
02:32:10,460 --> 02:32:13,080
This diagram that I put here is not

3228
02:32:13,080 --> 02:32:16,319
It's something very not just that you have to take

3229
02:32:16,319 --> 02:32:18,120
very literal very to heart I just

3230
02:32:18,120 --> 02:32:20,520
I did to be able to offer a description

3231
02:32:20,520 --> 02:32:23,100
graph and right now we will see why there is no

3232
02:32:23,100 --> 02:32:25,319
to take it very literally then here

3233
02:32:25,319 --> 02:32:28,319
Our investigation will start in

3234
02:32:28,319 --> 02:32:30,720
two sides or our inquiry will

3235
02:32:30,720 --> 02:32:32,220
start on the web and we

3236
02:32:32,220 --> 02:32:35,660
we want to go to the crisnet or

3237
02:32:35,660 --> 02:32:38,520
we will be investigating individuals or

3238
02:32:38,520 --> 02:32:41,580
a service a service group or

3239
02:32:41,580 --> 02:32:44,700
collective to exemplify this we can

3240
02:32:44,700 --> 02:32:47,520
think of a case where to resume the case

3241
02:32:47,520 --> 02:32:49,260
that I told them that we are

3242
02:32:49,260 --> 02:32:50,640
we find revenue in a newspaper

3243
02:32:50,640 --> 02:32:53,160
a publication where it is said that

3244
02:32:53,160 --> 02:32:56,760
is selling illegal products in my

3245
02:32:56,760 --> 02:33:00,120
country and I want to verify that this Union does

3246
02:33:00,120 --> 02:33:02,040
exists and that this is a legitimate Union

3247
02:33:02,040 --> 02:33:03,720
who is selling products then

3248
02:33:03,720 --> 02:33:05,880
here my research is starting in

3249
02:33:05,880 --> 02:33:07,859
the surface web I am investigating a

3250
02:33:07,859 --> 02:33:10,680
service and my ultimate goal to reach

3251
02:33:10,680 --> 02:33:13,319
towards the Dark web otherwise we can

3252
02:33:13,319 --> 02:33:15,300
to think that I am already in the Dark web and

3253
02:33:15,300 --> 02:33:18,420
inside this I find a user

3254
02:33:18,420 --> 02:33:20,880
who is selling good ranson to

3255
02:33:20,880 --> 02:33:23,300
service and I want to know

3256
02:33:23,300 --> 02:33:26,819
this person is anonymous profile of the

3257
02:33:26,819 --> 02:33:29,460
give web I want to link it to a

3258
02:33:29,460 --> 02:33:31,740
profile a person in the cleaner and

3259
02:33:31,740 --> 02:33:34,020
finally use this to link it to

3260
02:33:34,020 --> 02:33:35,520
a real person then here my

3261
02:33:35,520 --> 02:33:37,680
investigation is beginning in the part

3262
02:33:37,680 --> 02:33:39,540
lower we are investigating in the Dark

3263
02:33:39,540 --> 02:33:41,100
web what you are investigating is a

3264
02:33:41,100 --> 02:33:43,560
person and my ultimate goal is to reach

3265
02:33:43,560 --> 02:33:45,720
towards the web urces then the

3266
02:33:45,720 --> 02:33:50,220
techniques and processes vary and Good of

3267
02:33:50,220 --> 02:33:51,479
again don't take this too literally

3268
02:33:51,479 --> 02:33:53,880
more than anything it's one it's one it's a support

3269
02:33:53,880 --> 02:33:55,740
graph I have here but let's

3270
02:33:55,740 --> 02:33:58,500
start with the first technique and this is

3271
02:33:58,500 --> 02:34:01,260
the onion hunt or the search for

3272
02:34:01,260 --> 02:34:03,720
ripples on top can see

3273
02:34:03,720 --> 02:34:06,200
that I am classifying them

3274
02:34:06,200 --> 02:34:08,760
the technique according to the quadrant in which

3275
02:34:08,760 --> 02:34:11,700
in which it falls then to start

3276
02:34:11,700 --> 02:34:13,800
we are in the cleared and I want

3277
02:34:13,800 --> 02:34:16,200
start classifying looking for ononyms that

3278
02:34:16,200 --> 02:34:17,939
I can be useful we can start

3279
02:34:17,939 --> 02:34:19,380
using sites that are quite

3280
02:34:19,380 --> 02:34:21,420
good as is the tour in Wiki

3281
02:34:21,420 --> 02:34:24,240
there are a thousand versions of any here

3282
02:34:24,240 --> 02:34:26,939
It can serve us network It has good network

3283
02:34:26,939 --> 02:34:29,460
who talk about the dark web we can

3284
02:34:29,460 --> 02:34:33,240
Search on Facebook or sites dedicated to

3285
02:34:33,240 --> 02:34:36,060
the web as they are online or not a Tree O

3286
02:34:36,060 --> 02:34:38,220
tortaxie to expedite this process

3287
02:34:38,220 --> 02:34:41,280
we can use dorks here you can see

3288
02:34:41,280 --> 02:34:43,439
that I have a dork that is looking for

3289
02:34:43,439 --> 02:34:46,920
peaces of past Bin is looking for that the

3290
02:34:46,920 --> 02:34:49,859
Face contains the text punto onion that is

3291
02:34:49,859 --> 02:34:53,100
an address to wash tour web and that

3292
02:34:53,100 --> 02:34:55,939
be 2022 sites here if you know of

3293
02:34:55,939 --> 02:34:58,979
you can create your own doubles

3294
02:34:58,979 --> 02:35:02,760
and on Twitter we can do something similar

3295
02:35:02,760 --> 02:35:04,500
to the dogs using the search engine of

3296
02:35:04,500 --> 02:35:06,180
Twitter and here you can see that I have

3297
02:35:06,180 --> 02:35:08,939
two two different strings in which

3298
02:35:08,939 --> 02:35:12,800
one I'm looking for onions that

3299
02:35:12,800 --> 02:35:15,600
contain the word ransomware in the

3300
02:35:15,600 --> 02:35:17,359
twist and i'm filtering

3301
02:35:17,359 --> 02:35:19,500
I want to see only posts

3302
02:35:19,500 --> 02:35:23,760
originals in the Core below We are

3303
02:35:23,760 --> 02:35:26,939
looking for posts starting with

3304
02:35:26,939 --> 02:35:29,460
good that they carry the http content and that

3305
02:35:29,460 --> 02:35:32,700
finish with onion then Twitter already

3306
02:35:32,700 --> 02:35:34,500
They know that this place of cybersecurity

3307
02:35:34,500 --> 02:35:36,420
you get to find good content by

3308
02:35:36,420 --> 02:35:38,280
there we can also use our

3309
02:35:38,280 --> 02:35:40,740
good chadan friend to find sites

3310
02:35:40,740 --> 02:35:43,500
there is something called onion location that

3311
02:35:43,500 --> 02:35:46,500
is an http header that allows

3312
02:35:46,500 --> 02:35:48,600
sites on the clearned or the network

3313
02:35:48,600 --> 02:35:50,700
surface announce their variant of

3314
02:35:50,700 --> 02:35:52,560
wash web can we think somewhere

3315
02:35:52,560 --> 02:35:55,979
as is the New York Times or the defcon

3316
02:35:55,979 --> 02:35:59,899
what are sites that have pages

3317
02:35:59,899 --> 02:36:03,660
Then these sites advertise their

3318
02:36:03,660 --> 02:36:06,479
variant via the http header of

3319
02:36:06,479 --> 02:36:08,580
Union location we can carry out a

3320
02:36:08,580 --> 02:36:10,560
leather and simpler as onion stitch or

3321
02:36:10,560 --> 02:36:12,720
do a search for ssl and it contains

3322
02:36:12,720 --> 02:36:14,760
fist that they are is very similar but

3323
02:36:14,760 --> 02:36:18,200
give slightly different results

3324
02:36:18,200 --> 02:36:21,300
we can also make use of crowlers and

3325
02:36:21,300 --> 02:36:23,580
spiders These are programs that we

3326
02:36:23,580 --> 02:36:26,819
we run and leave running and they are

3327
02:36:26,819 --> 02:36:28,920
browsing dark web sites are

3328
02:36:28,920 --> 02:36:30,660
accessing the links and are registering

3329
02:36:30,660 --> 02:36:33,300
information and collecting it for

3330
02:36:33,300 --> 02:36:34,100
us

3331
02:36:34,100 --> 02:36:36,300
some crawlers that I recommend are

3332
02:36:36,300 --> 02:36:39,240
grim on Instant and onion search

3333
02:36:39,240 --> 02:36:41,819
and that is why I told them that they will not take

3334
02:36:41,819 --> 02:36:44,880
very literally the quadrant

3335
02:36:44,880 --> 02:36:46,100
why

3336
02:36:46,100 --> 02:36:49,380
Here we are going to enter techniques that

3337
02:36:49,380 --> 02:36:51,420
overlap not originally we are

3338
02:36:51,420 --> 02:36:53,880
a technique that started but we are already

3339
02:36:53,880 --> 02:36:56,160
passing us on par So we

3340
02:36:56,160 --> 02:36:58,740
we can use a search engine

3341
02:36:58,740 --> 02:37:01,939
give web as are Ania torch norible

3342
02:37:01,939 --> 02:37:05,340
the Dark is not indexed, that is to say that for

3343
02:37:05,340 --> 02:37:06,899
navigating it is a little more complicated

3344
02:37:06,899 --> 02:37:09,060
because we have to be

3345
02:37:09,060 --> 02:37:11,520
accessing link by link why do

3346
02:37:11,520 --> 02:37:13,020
a search will find the

3347
02:37:13,020 --> 02:37:14,359
nature

3348
02:37:14,359 --> 02:37:17,600
however they have managed to create

3349
02:37:17,600 --> 02:37:19,280
seekers

3350
02:37:19,280 --> 02:37:22,140
good search engines are these that I have

3351
02:37:22,140 --> 02:37:25,500
here norible then if the web does not

3352
02:37:25,500 --> 02:37:27,240
is indexed how these operate

3353
02:37:27,240 --> 02:37:29,700
these changes Well, you have

3354
02:37:29,700 --> 02:37:31,740
information in two ways the first is

3355
02:37:31,740 --> 02:37:33,540
through the crowders that is to say the people

3356
02:37:33,540 --> 02:37:36,479
is uploading the information and the

3357
02:37:36,479 --> 02:37:38,700
second and most normal is through

3358
02:37:38,700 --> 02:37:40,500
the crones and spiders these have a

3359
02:37:40,500 --> 02:37:42,240
crowler running all the time

3360
02:37:42,240 --> 02:37:44,040
every time you find a new one

3361
02:37:44,040 --> 02:37:47,520
Union and expectation indexes it and so on

3362
02:37:47,520 --> 02:37:48,780
is how we can do

3363
02:37:48,780 --> 02:37:50,640
searches the Search engines are already going

3364
02:37:50,640 --> 02:37:52,560
improving still not very good but

3365
02:37:52,560 --> 02:37:55,500
but we are already sabers And finally

3366
02:37:55,500 --> 02:37:58,800
we can use good sites like what

3367
02:37:58,800 --> 02:38:00,300
are some directories of the Dark web

3368
02:38:00,300 --> 02:38:02,640
we can use dred which is a network

3369
02:38:02,640 --> 02:38:04,680
social network style is a copy of reddit

3370
02:38:04,680 --> 02:38:06,660
or we can use specific directories

3371
02:38:06,660 --> 02:38:10,260
like the Sons or the onion link directory

3372
02:38:10,260 --> 02:38:11,700
there are many others these are only

3373
02:38:11,700 --> 02:38:12,979
Some

3374
02:38:12,979 --> 02:38:15,899
there we can see an example of how

3375
02:38:15,899 --> 02:38:21,240
come when we look for the location in

3376
02:38:21,240 --> 02:38:22,800
shodan we can see we get some

3377
02:38:22,800 --> 02:38:24,300
results particularly the first

3378
02:38:24,300 --> 02:38:27,300
two are the result are the page of the

3379
02:38:27,300 --> 02:38:29,280
project thor and globalix and

3380
02:38:29,280 --> 02:38:30,359
obviously they are projects that

3381
02:38:30,359 --> 02:38:32,040
we would expect them to have their variant in

3382
02:38:32,040 --> 02:38:35,220
the dark web and the clickernet

3383
02:38:35,220 --> 02:38:38,160
and this is how it looks using one of the pueris

3384
02:38:38,160 --> 02:38:40,140
from Twitter on this on this occasion I

3385
02:38:40,140 --> 02:38:41,640
I recommend that you filter them by

3386
02:38:41,640 --> 02:38:45,060
most recent or that only

3387
02:38:45,060 --> 02:38:47,460
give priority to results

3388
02:38:47,460 --> 02:38:49,260
It's been less than a year, we'll see.

3389
02:38:49,260 --> 02:38:52,560
what? And in this particular case I

3390
02:38:52,560 --> 02:38:53,819
I liked the results I got

3391
02:38:53,819 --> 02:38:57,180
using this this because I managed

3392
02:38:57,180 --> 02:39:02,040
find a collection of groups of

3393
02:39:02,040 --> 02:39:03,240
ranson Well then we know

3394
02:39:03,240 --> 02:39:05,040
that groups of ram usually die

3395
02:39:05,040 --> 02:39:07,500
have usually have their activity in the in

3396
02:39:07,500 --> 02:39:09,840
the give web that is where you pay them the

3397
02:39:09,840 --> 02:39:11,460
ranson and publish their information

3398
02:39:11,460 --> 02:39:14,040
so this was a good result

3399
02:39:14,040 --> 02:39:15,600
the one I found. So I recommend it

3400
02:39:15,600 --> 02:39:17,399
I use Twitter a lot

3401
02:39:17,399 --> 02:39:20,340
and this is how it looks like this is how it looks when

3402
02:39:20,340 --> 02:39:21,319
we run

3403
02:39:21,319 --> 02:39:23,240
one

3404
02:39:23,240 --> 02:39:25,319
Here I am running the tool

3405
02:39:25,319 --> 02:39:28,380
Union serc with which I am doing

3406
02:39:28,380 --> 02:39:30,319
a passport search

3407
02:39:30,319 --> 02:39:33,840
and I am using the changing of

3408
02:39:33,840 --> 02:39:36,800
heistak in this case it saves me a

3409
02:39:36,800 --> 02:39:39,120
text file that I am simply

3410
02:39:39,120 --> 02:39:41,540
probing getting the information out of this

3411
02:39:41,540 --> 02:39:44,220
here you can see that he found me several

3412
02:39:44,220 --> 02:39:45,780
different passport sites here

3413
02:39:45,780 --> 02:39:48,720
you can already see the onions and you can see

3414
02:39:48,720 --> 02:39:51,180
that many sites are are repeated here

3415
02:39:51,180 --> 02:39:52,979
what can happen is that it is taking out

3416
02:39:52,979 --> 02:39:55,740
the same site from different places or

3417
02:39:55,740 --> 02:39:58,140
which are mirrors, that is, the same site

3418
02:39:58,140 --> 02:40:00,780
but its alternative in case it arrives

3419
02:40:00,780 --> 02:40:03,420
to fall then that's how they come to

3420
02:40:03,420 --> 02:40:06,000
work clones are pretty good

3421
02:40:06,000 --> 02:40:07,920
I recommend using a minimum for

3422
02:40:07,920 --> 02:40:10,020
to experience

3423
02:40:10,020 --> 02:40:11,580
Let's go in with something a little more

3424
02:40:11,580 --> 02:40:14,220
technician who is analyzing keys

3425
02:40:14,220 --> 02:40:17,300
pgp or pgp pgp means

3426
02:40:17,300 --> 02:40:20,700
What is a cryptography protocol?

3427
02:40:20,700 --> 02:40:24,180
y is the cryptography system by

3428
02:40:24,180 --> 02:40:26,880
default and favorite of the Dark web For

3429
02:40:26,880 --> 02:40:28,800
what works We know what to wash

3430
02:40:28,800 --> 02:40:31,319
website we cannot advertise our

3431
02:40:31,319 --> 02:40:32,939
identity we can put our

3432
02:40:32,939 --> 02:40:35,640
name our photo our email no

3433
02:40:35,640 --> 02:40:37,859
it works like this. So we for

3434
02:40:37,859 --> 02:40:39,899
to maintain our reputation and

3435
02:40:39,899 --> 02:40:41,700
show that we are who we say we are

3436
02:40:41,700 --> 02:40:44,939
we use pgp keys

3437
02:40:44,939 --> 02:40:47,939
however there are two problems here

3438
02:40:47,939 --> 02:40:50,220
is one key reuse is

3439
02:40:50,220 --> 02:40:53,580
say we'll see that although not all of us

3440
02:40:53,580 --> 02:40:55,260
they say or we tend to believe that washing the web

3441
02:40:55,260 --> 02:40:58,500
they are all evil geniuses geniuses this of

3442
02:40:58,500 --> 02:41:00,359
that of computer security is not like that

3443
02:41:00,359 --> 02:41:02,819
there are many people who do not have their

3444
02:41:02,819 --> 02:41:05,580
cybersecurity bases of anonymity and

3445
02:41:05,580 --> 02:41:08,040
especially off the operation Security

3446
02:41:08,040 --> 02:41:09,600
So you don't have good hygiene

3447
02:41:09,600 --> 02:41:13,020
digital which ends up being that

3448
02:41:13,020 --> 02:41:15,240
several little details come to pass such as

3449
02:41:15,240 --> 02:41:17,600
this or what

3450
02:41:17,600 --> 02:41:20,399
come to fall into errors then there is

3451
02:41:20,399 --> 02:41:22,319
people have not come to pass that the

3452
02:41:22,319 --> 02:41:24,479
pgp keys are reused in the

3453
02:41:24,479 --> 02:41:26,640
clivernet then the same pgp key

3454
02:41:26,640 --> 02:41:27,830
that I use for

3455
02:41:27,830 --> 02:41:29,100
[Music]

3456
02:41:29,100 --> 02:41:32,460
my identity in the in the in the web

3457
02:41:32,460 --> 02:41:35,220
I use it in my Gmail mail in the

3458
02:41:35,220 --> 02:41:37,319
clearmey well that's not a good

3459
02:41:37,319 --> 02:41:38,300
technique

3460
02:41:38,300 --> 02:41:40,920
Another thing I have to say is that the

3461
02:41:40,920 --> 02:41:43,140
pgp keys to create them must be

3462
02:41:43,140 --> 02:41:46,140
bind to two things a user and a

3463
02:41:46,140 --> 02:41:48,540
man and a mail and that's where

3464
02:41:48,540 --> 02:41:50,819
Cleopatra comes to help them Cleopatra

3465
02:41:50,819 --> 02:41:52,319
helps us extract information from

3466
02:41:52,319 --> 02:41:54,359
particular pgp keys what

3467
02:41:54,359 --> 02:41:56,399
we are interested in extracting are the

3468
02:41:56,399 --> 02:41:58,920
emails once we already have

3469
02:41:58,920 --> 02:42:01,800
an email and we can use the oscin

3470
02:42:01,800 --> 02:42:03,780
framework to start getting some

3471
02:42:03,780 --> 02:42:05,700
more advanced techniques and be able to extract

3472
02:42:05,700 --> 02:42:09,060
more information from this email

3473
02:42:09,060 --> 02:42:12,240
here you can see an example where you are

3474
02:42:12,240 --> 02:42:14,520
using the pgp key to verify

3475
02:42:14,520 --> 02:42:17,399
the identity of the creator of this

3476
02:42:17,399 --> 02:42:19,319
site and the veracity of this site this

3477
02:42:19,319 --> 02:42:21,840
it's hackdown it's a cyber academy

3478
02:42:21,840 --> 02:42:23,700
Crime and it's not a hacking academy

3479
02:42:23,700 --> 02:42:25,319
it's a cybercrime academy they're things

3480
02:42:25,319 --> 02:42:27,780
different then here you can see that

3481
02:42:27,780 --> 02:42:30,380
in the red box that I put below

3482
02:42:30,380 --> 02:42:32,520
this person is giving us the link

3483
02:42:32,520 --> 02:42:36,120
for us to see your keys

3484
02:42:36,120 --> 02:42:39,540
pgp here we can see a marketplace that

3485
02:42:39,540 --> 02:42:42,240
is also giving us a pgp key

3486
02:42:42,240 --> 02:42:43,920
but here is not giving us the key in

3487
02:42:43,920 --> 02:42:46,260
Yes, here what is giving us is already the

3488
02:42:46,260 --> 02:42:49,020
signature So we Well if they are

3489
02:42:49,020 --> 02:42:50,939
familiar with the system so

3490
02:42:50,939 --> 02:42:52,740
is the cryptography they will know that we usually

3491
02:42:52,740 --> 02:42:54,420
have two keys the public key and the

3492
02:42:54,420 --> 02:42:56,460
private key then one we use it

3493
02:42:56,460 --> 02:42:57,780
to encrypt and another we use for

3494
02:42:57,780 --> 02:43:00,120
verify signatures Excuse me to sign

3495
02:43:00,120 --> 02:43:01,500
or to verify signatures or to

3496
02:43:01,500 --> 02:43:05,180
encrypt and decrypt then

3497
02:43:05,180 --> 02:43:07,680
this here we can see that this market

3498
02:43:07,680 --> 02:43:12,000
He is already giving us his signature with his

3499
02:43:12,000 --> 02:43:13,920
apgp for us to access

3500
02:43:13,920 --> 02:43:15,540
we can verify this Signature you can

3501
02:43:15,540 --> 02:43:18,359
think as something similar to yes

3502
02:43:18,359 --> 02:43:21,240
we were using a hash of md5

3503
02:43:21,240 --> 02:43:24,000
Star verifying the sum of a Hash

3504
02:43:24,000 --> 02:43:26,280
of md5 in this case not so much because of the theme

3505
02:43:26,280 --> 02:43:28,680
of integrity but more for the issue of

3506
02:43:28,680 --> 02:43:30,960
identity to see that this page is

3507
02:43:30,960 --> 02:43:32,640
who does he say he is

3508
02:43:32,640 --> 02:43:34,979
And finally Here I have another market

3509
02:43:34,979 --> 02:43:39,359
and this case to control the past if we

3510
02:43:39,359 --> 02:43:41,939
you are already giving your pgp public key the

3511
02:43:41,939 --> 02:43:43,560
public key is this that we have below

3512
02:43:43,560 --> 02:43:46,800
What is this series of random text Well

3513
02:43:46,800 --> 02:43:49,560
yeah basically it's a key

3514
02:43:49,560 --> 02:43:52,080
that in this case they are not giving them to

3515
02:43:52,080 --> 02:43:53,640
that we can have one

3516
02:43:53,640 --> 02:43:55,020
secure communication so that we

3517
02:43:55,020 --> 02:43:56,939
we can encrypt the information we

3518
02:43:56,939 --> 02:43:58,680
we command that they can decipher it and

3519
02:43:58,680 --> 02:44:03,060
that in this way is protected

3520
02:44:03,060 --> 02:44:04,979
However, I told them that this is not usually

3521
02:44:04,979 --> 02:44:06,200
Not to be

3522
02:44:06,200 --> 02:44:08,460
we know what we are doing we can

3523
02:44:08,460 --> 02:44:10,319
fall into errors here we have the

3524
02:44:10,319 --> 02:44:12,840
Cleopatra tool in use from the side

3525
02:44:12,840 --> 02:44:14,700
right i have a public pgp key

3526
02:44:14,700 --> 02:44:17,880
that I generated and on the left side

3527
02:44:17,880 --> 02:44:18,960
I am demonstrating the use of the

3528
02:44:18,960 --> 02:44:20,580
tool then you can see that I

3529
02:44:20,580 --> 02:44:22,859
Cleopatra mail I give to import key

3530
02:44:22,859 --> 02:44:24,740
I'm looking for my key

3531
02:44:24,740 --> 02:44:27,780
I give it to him and immediately

3532
02:44:27,780 --> 02:44:29,819
I already skip the mail that is being

3533
02:44:29,819 --> 02:44:31,560
using there So we already

3534
02:44:31,560 --> 02:44:34,040
We have the mail that is Salvador at

3535
02:44:34,040 --> 02:44:36,180
darknet.org a clearly fake email

3536
02:44:36,180 --> 02:44:39,060
However, you already saw how simple it is

3537
02:44:39,060 --> 02:44:40,800
for Cleopatra to extract this information

3538
02:44:40,800 --> 02:44:43,680
This is why I like this technique a lot.

3539
02:44:43,680 --> 02:44:45,060
very good and have been obtained

3540
02:44:45,060 --> 02:44:47,700
good stuff here

3541
02:44:47,700 --> 02:44:49,140
and all that I will be

3542
02:44:49,140 --> 02:44:50,700
talking to you I'll be talking to you

3543
02:44:50,700 --> 02:44:53,280
for a reason or is it something that has happened to me

3544
02:44:53,280 --> 02:44:54,780
touched live is something that I have used

3545
02:44:54,780 --> 02:44:57,359
and it has obtained good results for me or is it

3546
02:44:57,359 --> 02:45:00,060
something that I have seen that that has

3547
02:45:00,060 --> 02:45:00,960
worked someone else in this case

3548
02:45:00,960 --> 02:45:05,220
We have news that is that from ago

3549
02:45:05,220 --> 02:45:07,260
two years I think it was that a

3550
02:45:07,260 --> 02:45:09,720
vendor selling on a site called

3551
02:45:09,720 --> 02:45:12,600
alphabet was usually used by the user

3552
02:45:12,600 --> 02:45:16,319
from area 51 or from darka Apollo Well, it was

3553
02:45:16,319 --> 02:45:18,540
sentenced to six years in prison

3554
02:45:18,540 --> 02:45:20,160
person managed to identify and

3555
02:45:20,160 --> 02:45:22,319
capture because in the key

3556
02:45:22,319 --> 02:45:24,420
public that they used as a seller to

3557
02:45:24,420 --> 02:45:26,939
that its users could communicate

3558
02:45:26,939 --> 02:45:28,020
with the

3559
02:45:28,020 --> 02:45:29,660
well

3560
02:45:29,660 --> 02:45:33,420
he used his personal email then well

3561
02:45:33,420 --> 02:45:35,340
this email was simply linked

3562
02:45:35,340 --> 02:45:37,740
with your social networks with your profile

3563
02:45:37,740 --> 02:45:39,120
Instagram Facebook and I think too

3564
02:45:39,120 --> 02:45:41,819
Twitter and well what they are seeing

3565
02:45:41,819 --> 02:45:43,260
on screen is what is not happening

3566
02:45:43,260 --> 02:45:44,520
this person

3567
02:45:44,520 --> 02:45:46,920
so believe me Those techniques do have

3568
02:45:46,920 --> 02:45:49,020
use in real life and especially because

3569
02:45:49,020 --> 02:45:52,500
is new not all are geniuses as we

3570
02:45:52,500 --> 02:45:54,720
have wanted to sell we can think of a

3571
02:45:54,720 --> 02:45:56,880
very famous case that is the case of dread

3572
02:45:56,880 --> 02:45:59,040
Payad Roberts who is the creator of the

3573
02:45:59,040 --> 02:46:00,840
silk that just fell due to a bug

3574
02:46:00,840 --> 02:46:02,760
very simple also linked to a

3575
02:46:02,760 --> 02:46:04,800
gmail account

3576
02:46:04,800 --> 02:46:07,080
Now we are going to use a very

3577
02:46:07,080 --> 02:46:10,020
simple very very common from The Sims

3578
02:46:10,020 --> 02:46:12,060
normal but it also works in the Dark

3579
02:46:12,060 --> 02:46:14,939
web that is the hunt for many users

3580
02:46:14,939 --> 02:46:18,780
users reuse their their usernames

3581
02:46:18,780 --> 02:46:20,160
users is a user they like

3582
02:46:20,160 --> 02:46:22,319
a lot then they use it and well that

3583
02:46:22,319 --> 02:46:24,000
helps us We can

3584
02:46:24,000 --> 02:46:26,340
use

3585
02:46:26,340 --> 02:46:28,740
tools such as Sherlock What's

3586
02:46:28,740 --> 02:46:31,920
my name or name check up to see that

3587
02:46:31,920 --> 02:46:33,899
user what other accounts are you on

3588
02:46:33,899 --> 02:46:36,420
using no what other networks are you using

3589
02:46:36,420 --> 02:46:37,460
using

3590
02:46:37,460 --> 02:46:40,560
and well, we are not just interested in seeing

3591
02:46:40,560 --> 02:46:42,359
where they are most reused but also

3592
02:46:42,359 --> 02:46:44,580
we can extract good information from

3593
02:46:44,580 --> 02:46:48,800
user there are many people who use

3594
02:46:48,800 --> 02:46:51,720
its users create them from a

3595
02:46:51,720 --> 02:46:53,460
variant is a man using the

3596
02:46:53,460 --> 02:46:55,260
initial of your name or letters of your

3597
02:46:55,260 --> 02:46:58,380
name or also the user will

3598
02:46:58,380 --> 02:47:00,479
say, for example, what language it is in or

3599
02:47:00,479 --> 02:47:02,819
is going to give us information for what

3600
02:47:02,819 --> 02:47:06,479
uses can be given to that

3601
02:47:06,479 --> 02:47:10,220
to this to this to this account So

3602
02:47:10,220 --> 02:47:12,300
we can extract good

3603
02:47:12,300 --> 02:47:14,819
simply username information

3604
02:47:14,819 --> 02:47:16,920
Here you can see that I found a site

3605
02:47:16,920 --> 02:47:21,120
in a malware forum where they are

3606
02:47:21,120 --> 02:47:22,399
asking

3607
02:47:22,399 --> 02:47:24,840
affiliates affiliates are basically

3608
02:47:24,840 --> 02:47:27,300
looking for insiders to help them

3609
02:47:27,300 --> 02:47:28,800
infiltrate the companies where they work

3610
02:47:28,800 --> 02:47:30,960
in order to install the ransomware and

3611
02:47:30,960 --> 02:47:32,700
extract information from them This is a new

3612
02:47:32,700 --> 02:47:35,340
summary group called Black snake and

3613
02:47:35,340 --> 02:47:38,899
because they offer you 15% commission

3614
02:47:38,899 --> 02:47:42,780
very bad this one But well here what I

3615
02:47:42,780 --> 02:47:44,819
I did was take that user who is new

3616
02:47:44,819 --> 02:47:46,380
it is censored is what is a little

3617
02:47:46,380 --> 02:47:49,140
pixelated at the top because the

3618
02:47:49,140 --> 02:47:51,000
joke is talking is to exhibit ni

3619
02:47:51,000 --> 02:47:53,580
burn anyone, it is only to explain to them

3620
02:47:53,580 --> 02:47:55,859
a little over the bar then in the

3621
02:47:55,859 --> 02:47:57,060
that you are a censored part

3622
02:47:57,060 --> 02:47:59,280
superior is the user of this person

3623
02:47:59,280 --> 02:48:00,899
who is offering this rams as it was

3624
02:48:00,899 --> 02:48:03,960
your service bottom right what

3625
02:48:03,960 --> 02:48:05,520
What I did was use the tool

3626
02:48:05,520 --> 02:48:08,340
of What's my name to look for that

3627
02:48:08,340 --> 02:48:10,620
user where else was using and i

3628
02:48:10,620 --> 02:48:12,140
I managed to find very good results

3629
02:48:12,140 --> 02:48:15,060
particularly I managed to link that the

3630
02:48:15,060 --> 02:48:17,880
Telegram reddit account and link 3

3631
02:48:17,880 --> 02:48:20,819
they are from the same person who made this

3632
02:48:20,819 --> 02:48:22,800
post is discussing the same

3633
02:48:22,800 --> 02:48:24,600
ransomed issues and something even more

3634
02:48:24,600 --> 02:48:25,979
interesting is that on reddit too

3635
02:48:25,979 --> 02:48:27,300
discuss one or another personal topic

3636
02:48:27,300 --> 02:48:29,880
So we already achieved a step

3637
02:48:29,880 --> 02:48:32,580
giant that is to pass this person

3638
02:48:32,580 --> 02:48:34,140
anonymous this person that I have neither

3639
02:48:34,140 --> 02:48:36,000
idea who will be able to do this user this

3640
02:48:36,000 --> 02:48:38,160
just a username

3641
02:48:38,160 --> 02:48:41,040
web bar we already managed to link to

3642
02:48:41,040 --> 02:48:42,960
accounts of the cleared with which already

3643
02:48:42,960 --> 02:48:45,359
we are one step further to

3644
02:48:45,359 --> 02:48:47,700
link it to a real person and Well

3645
02:48:47,700 --> 02:48:49,439
well here we could carry out

3646
02:48:49,439 --> 02:48:53,240
very simple techniques such as

3647
02:48:53,240 --> 02:48:56,540
this to do further research on

3648
02:48:56,540 --> 02:48:59,100
these accounts to see if we can extract

3649
02:48:59,100 --> 02:49:01,920
mail or in case it was the

3650
02:49:01,920 --> 02:49:05,939
law stuck here could already get one one

3651
02:49:05,939 --> 02:49:08,040
order for some place to give them

3652
02:49:08,040 --> 02:49:09,720
information about these accounts then

3653
02:49:09,720 --> 02:49:12,000
Well yes that is a case that I found

3654
02:49:12,000 --> 02:49:13,859
I like to share this post

3655
02:49:13,859 --> 02:49:16,979
black smith black snake trans not

3656
02:49:16,979 --> 02:49:19,140
I know if anyone has already heard of that

3657
02:49:19,140 --> 02:49:22,200
of that form ransomware But well if

3658
02:49:22,200 --> 02:49:23,700
It was a post I came across

3659
02:49:23,700 --> 02:49:25,500
there that I liked to share in

3660
02:49:25,500 --> 02:49:26,939
this talk

3661
02:49:26,939 --> 02:49:30,420
now topic of image analysis very

3662
02:49:30,420 --> 02:49:32,220
important not everyone who likes

3663
02:49:32,220 --> 02:49:34,819
forensic issues or

3664
02:49:34,819 --> 02:49:38,100
you already looked like we are very good for

3665
02:49:38,100 --> 02:49:39,899
you we can start from

3666
02:49:39,899 --> 02:49:41,220
something very simple like making a

3667
02:49:41,220 --> 02:49:43,380
reverse image search using

3668
02:49:43,380 --> 02:49:45,560
tools like yandex Google images

3669
02:49:45,560 --> 02:49:48,180
to see if this image is already used

3670
02:49:48,180 --> 02:49:50,819
in other places We can also

3671
02:49:50,819 --> 02:49:53,340
extract metadata information

3672
02:49:53,340 --> 02:49:55,740
using tools like exit tool

3673
02:49:55,740 --> 02:49:58,800
metal and see what information it contains

3674
02:49:58,800 --> 02:50:02,180
this image and finally we can make

3675
02:50:02,180 --> 02:50:06,060
extraction digital extraction of the

3676
02:50:06,060 --> 02:50:08,880
image not this we can get information

3677
02:50:08,880 --> 02:50:12,240
that the image is giving us form the

3678
02:50:12,240 --> 02:50:14,100
that it has happened to the seller

3679
02:50:14,100 --> 02:50:15,180
we can look for traits

3680
02:50:15,180 --> 02:50:18,000
distinctive For example if in the photo

3681
02:50:18,000 --> 02:50:19,500
of the seller is not advertising its

3682
02:50:19,500 --> 02:50:22,380
product leaves some part of your body

3683
02:50:22,380 --> 02:50:24,120
and in that part of his body there is a tattoo

3684
02:50:24,120 --> 02:50:26,220
Boom hallmark we already have something

3685
02:50:26,220 --> 02:50:27,660
very important to keep growing

3686
02:50:27,660 --> 02:50:30,479
our research we can get you

3687
02:50:30,479 --> 02:50:32,040
a lot of context the image this is

3688
02:50:32,040 --> 02:50:34,680
very important if a photo of the

3689
02:50:34,680 --> 02:50:36,240
background window and we managed to see

3690
02:50:36,240 --> 02:50:38,580
we can see the city more or less dark

3691
02:50:38,580 --> 02:50:41,160
the day was this In what city can

3692
02:50:41,160 --> 02:50:42,600
have been not In what neighborhood can

3693
02:50:42,600 --> 02:50:44,819
be this person we can get another

3694
02:50:44,819 --> 02:50:46,460
kind of information like

3695
02:50:46,460 --> 02:50:48,979
the zero of this person

3696
02:50:48,979 --> 02:50:51,960
know how well prepared you can be

3697
02:50:51,960 --> 02:50:54,060
or it cannot be and the other thing that we

3698
02:50:54,060 --> 02:50:54,960
interested are the attributes

3699
02:50:54,960 --> 02:50:57,120
correlational if we are

3700
02:50:57,120 --> 02:50:59,640
researching a vendor who offers

3701
02:50:59,640 --> 02:51:01,920
a services in different

3702
02:51:01,920 --> 02:51:03,899
Market places but uses a user

3703
02:51:03,899 --> 02:51:04,819
different

3704
02:51:04,819 --> 02:51:07,140
and we see their images and see

3705
02:51:07,140 --> 02:51:08,700
That all images are in places

3706
02:51:08,700 --> 02:51:10,380
similar than in a similar background

3707
02:51:10,380 --> 02:51:13,260
they have and it turns out that he writes his

3708
02:51:13,260 --> 02:51:14,700
username on a piece of paper

3709
02:51:14,700 --> 02:51:16,920
to demonstrate that if it is from the photo and

3710
02:51:16,920 --> 02:51:19,020
we can see that the way

3711
02:51:19,020 --> 02:51:21,180
which one he wrote is very similar to others

3712
02:51:21,180 --> 02:51:23,220
posts on other marketplaces

3713
02:51:23,220 --> 02:51:24,479
different but we already can

3714
02:51:24,479 --> 02:51:26,939
begin to link to correlate that to

3715
02:51:26,939 --> 02:51:29,760
the mere this is from the same person

3716
02:51:29,760 --> 02:51:31,740
in this case I have an image that

3717
02:51:31,740 --> 02:51:33,300
I found in a group of arms sales

3718
02:51:33,300 --> 02:51:35,000
East

3719
02:51:35,000 --> 02:51:37,560
I found this particular one I chose

3720
02:51:37,560 --> 02:51:39,899
this photo and this site because the image

3721
02:51:39,899 --> 02:51:41,520
it is of very good quality something that is not

3722
02:51:41,520 --> 02:51:43,560
It is usually very normal on the web

3723
02:51:43,560 --> 02:51:45,540
so here they are not selling this

3724
02:51:45,540 --> 02:51:48,359
weapon for the price we see below and

3725
02:51:48,359 --> 02:51:49,560
well, take advantage of what you will imagine

3726
02:51:49,560 --> 02:51:51,840
good quality I downloaded it and it started to work

3727
02:51:51,840 --> 02:51:53,279
do my research on this case

3728
02:51:53,279 --> 02:51:56,040
use my favorite page to make

3729
02:51:56,040 --> 02:51:59,160
image search that is yandex and with

3730
02:51:59,160 --> 02:52:01,380
yandex and we can start to see things

3731
02:52:01,380 --> 02:52:03,060
very interesting on the right side

3732
02:52:03,060 --> 02:52:06,120
we can see that just as it is as well as

3733
02:52:06,120 --> 02:52:09,240
this image there are similar images with

3734
02:52:09,240 --> 02:52:11,819
which we can start to investigate further

3735
02:52:11,819 --> 02:52:14,160
but the most important thing for me was

3736
02:52:14,160 --> 02:52:15,960
that we found on the left side of the

3737
02:52:15,960 --> 02:52:18,120
left side we find two links that

3738
02:52:18,120 --> 02:52:20,060
I put them there in red very important

3739
02:52:20,060 --> 02:52:22,920
the link above the first

3740
02:52:22,920 --> 02:52:26,160
it was a porschan style forum but

3741
02:52:26,160 --> 02:52:28,200
video games only if you study topics

3742
02:52:28,200 --> 02:52:30,359
of videogames and here we can see what it is

3743
02:52:30,359 --> 02:52:32,160
exactly the same image

3744
02:52:32,160 --> 02:52:34,380
lighting same shadow same angle

3745
02:52:34,380 --> 02:52:36,620
same weapon same background everything is the same

3746
02:52:36,620 --> 02:52:40,380
this and that is posting in a

3747
02:52:40,380 --> 02:52:43,140
video game forum

3748
02:52:43,140 --> 02:52:45,300
Well, it's already a bit, it's already a bit

3749
02:52:45,300 --> 02:52:47,520
strange this here can lead me to

3750
02:52:47,520 --> 02:52:49,859
to think that this seller really is a

3751
02:52:49,859 --> 02:52:52,560
scam is a fraud and took this image from

3752
02:52:52,560 --> 02:52:55,260
this forum And still what leads me to

3753
02:52:55,260 --> 02:52:57,660
confirm even more is what I have

3754
02:52:57,660 --> 02:53:00,840
below this is a news where we are

3755
02:53:00,840 --> 02:53:03,000
saying 9 site admins

3756
02:53:03,000 --> 02:53:05,460
from the darknet were sentenced to seven

3757
02:53:05,460 --> 02:53:08,520
years and well they were caught

3758
02:53:08,520 --> 02:53:11,040
however if you realize in the part

3759
02:53:11,040 --> 02:53:14,279
below the website looks a lot like the

3760
02:53:14,279 --> 02:53:17,060
from here they look alike they are not the same

3761
02:53:17,060 --> 02:53:20,340
there are some details that let me know

3762
02:53:20,340 --> 02:53:21,840
that these are not the same and another detail

3763
02:53:21,840 --> 02:53:23,040
very important is that this page is

3764
02:53:23,040 --> 02:53:25,819
active today to 2022

3765
02:53:25,819 --> 02:53:28,380
and this article can be seen well

3766
02:53:28,380 --> 02:53:31,399
this article is from 2016

3767
02:53:31,399 --> 02:53:35,880
so 2016 to 2022 and the person is still

3768
02:53:35,880 --> 02:53:37,800
selling the same gun having makes me

3769
02:53:37,800 --> 02:53:39,960
a lot of sense that So through

3770
02:53:39,960 --> 02:53:42,000
those techniques were already enough network

3771
02:53:42,000 --> 02:53:43,859
Flags that led me to know that this

3772
02:53:43,859 --> 02:53:46,380
It is a fraudulent site This is a scam

3773
02:53:46,380 --> 02:53:48,060
and this was the objective that I had the

3774
02:53:48,060 --> 02:53:49,560
time to make this page this is

3775
02:53:49,560 --> 02:53:50,939
talk not I was I found

3776
02:53:50,939 --> 02:53:53,279
various web laundering sites various onions

3777
02:53:53,279 --> 02:53:55,859
and my objective was to determine how

3778
02:53:55,859 --> 02:53:58,859
legitimate were in this case because this

3779
02:53:58,859 --> 02:54:00,960
site is not legitimate we already have many

3780
02:54:00,960 --> 02:54:04,040
marks that tell us that it is not

3781
02:54:04,040 --> 02:54:06,540
and we return to the topic of Market Well

3782
02:54:06,540 --> 02:54:08,720
really how likely is it

3783
02:54:08,720 --> 02:54:10,740
find me data on the dark web then

3784
02:54:10,740 --> 02:54:11,580
Well I leave you this little one

3785
02:54:11,580 --> 02:54:14,819
research is very good and in this

3786
02:54:14,819 --> 02:54:18,300
research analyzed thousands of

3787
02:54:18,300 --> 02:54:21,720
images from Markets of the Dark sites

3788
02:54:21,720 --> 02:54:24,840
web and the information was extracted from

3789
02:54:24,840 --> 02:54:26,760
the metas we can see that in sites

3790
02:54:26,760 --> 02:54:29,040
very famous as Agora or Alfa Bay Agora

3791
02:54:29,040 --> 02:54:32,520
but the number 1 that analyzed 64 thousand

3792
02:54:32,520 --> 02:54:34,979
images of which 2000 images

3793
02:54:34,979 --> 02:54:39,720
they had metadata And even worse 214 of

3794
02:54:39,720 --> 02:54:42,000
those 2000 had the GPS information

3795
02:54:42,000 --> 02:54:43,979
So if you already manage to extract the

3796
02:54:43,979 --> 02:54:47,580
GPS information an image and you know the

3797
02:54:47,580 --> 02:54:49,620
seller's profile, well, you already know

3798
02:54:49,620 --> 02:54:51,180
which way can this one go

3799
02:54:51,180 --> 02:54:53,700
research and now I want to do a

3800
02:54:53,700 --> 02:54:55,200
little activity with you who are

3801
02:54:55,200 --> 02:54:57,060
here watching a little activity

3802
02:54:57,060 --> 02:54:59,700
that you in the chat and even Jaime

3803
02:54:59,700 --> 02:55:01,200
I don't know the ones who are here on the call

3804
02:55:01,200 --> 02:55:03,180
if you also want to participate

3805
02:55:03,180 --> 02:55:06,300
go ahead that is a 100% real case those

3806
02:55:06,300 --> 02:55:09,660
images are taken from lavar web

3807
02:55:09,660 --> 02:55:11,779
and this is a seller who was Caught

3808
02:55:11,779 --> 02:55:14,220
this person was caught by one of

3809
02:55:14,220 --> 02:55:15,420
these four images one of these

3810
02:55:15,420 --> 02:55:16,800
pictures gave them the information

3811
02:55:16,800 --> 02:55:18,840
needed to catch us then

3812
02:55:18,840 --> 02:55:20,700
go ahead listen to the chats here

3813
02:55:20,700 --> 02:55:23,100
I am watching the YouTube chat this is not

3814
02:55:23,100 --> 02:55:24,300
those who are here on the call with me

3815
02:55:24,300 --> 02:55:26,279
Well, I'm going to participate too.

3816
02:55:26,279 --> 02:55:29,040
here with the flat zoom this What a picture

3817
02:55:29,040 --> 02:55:31,140
do you think this person ratted out what

3818
02:55:31,140 --> 02:55:35,040
photo they think this gave him gave us the

3819
02:55:35,040 --> 02:55:36,180
information necessary to be able

3820
02:55:36,180 --> 02:55:37,979
identify this user let's go

3821
02:55:37,979 --> 02:55:40,979
I hear what photo do you think was the one of

3822
02:55:40,979 --> 02:55:43,620
hands very well here is mentioned

3823
02:55:43,620 --> 02:55:47,220
that was the one with the hands this little bit of the

3824
02:55:47,220 --> 02:55:48,359
chat I think there is a little So

3825
02:55:48,359 --> 02:55:49,859
Let's see in the chat what they tell us

3826
02:55:49,859 --> 02:55:53,899
what the public tells us

3827
02:55:54,020 --> 02:55:57,060
well and they are already identifying it is the

3828
02:55:57,060 --> 02:55:59,220
image with the hands was an activity

3829
02:55:59,220 --> 02:56:00,840
quite simple There they are already filling

3830
02:56:00,840 --> 02:56:02,819
the chat that was the one with the hands and well

3831
02:56:02,819 --> 02:56:05,279
what distinctive features are there in this in

3832
02:56:05,279 --> 02:56:06,540
this picture

3833
02:56:06,540 --> 02:56:08,420
Fingerprints

3834
02:56:08,420 --> 02:56:11,460
extract the fingerprints of this one of

3835
02:56:11,460 --> 02:56:13,439
this image It was quite simple I don't know

3836
02:56:13,439 --> 02:56:15,000
used any police software with a

3837
02:56:15,000 --> 02:56:17,160
super advanced software was used

3838
02:56:17,160 --> 02:56:20,160
Free open source gym was used

3839
02:56:20,160 --> 02:56:22,740
then yes above opensores This

3840
02:56:22,740 --> 02:56:25,560
So we already have a clear example of

3841
02:56:25,560 --> 02:56:27,960
a vendor in this case was El

3842
02:56:27,960 --> 02:56:30,300
cannabis seller who was convicted

3843
02:56:30,300 --> 02:56:31,859
and also a few years in prison

3844
02:56:31,859 --> 02:56:34,140
because you missed your hands on

3845
02:56:34,140 --> 02:56:36,479
This little photo you said was a

3846
02:56:36,479 --> 02:56:38,580
photo There were not many photos in which

3847
02:56:38,580 --> 02:56:42,720
their hands came out a somewhat sad case

3848
02:56:42,720 --> 02:56:46,080
now let's start talking about it

3849
02:56:46,080 --> 02:56:47,819
of blockchain something that gives me great pleasure

3850
02:56:47,819 --> 02:56:49,800
is that they have been following the

3851
02:56:49,800 --> 02:56:52,200
different talks various various of

3852
02:56:52,200 --> 02:56:54,420
These topics can be related to

3853
02:56:54,420 --> 02:56:55,800
past issues not for example here we go

3854
02:56:55,800 --> 02:56:57,960
to talk about the topic of blockchain there was already

3855
02:56:57,960 --> 02:56:59,939
a webpress chat and we're done

3856
02:56:59,939 --> 02:57:02,700
talking about issues we already talked about issues and

3857
02:57:02,700 --> 02:57:04,080
there were already some talks 200

3858
02:57:04,080 --> 02:57:06,479
So I really like that and

3859
02:57:06,479 --> 02:57:07,640
all right

3860
02:57:07,640 --> 02:57:11,340
on the web the way it moves

3861
02:57:11,340 --> 02:57:13,080
the money is through cryptocurrencies

3862
02:57:13,080 --> 02:57:15,660
Not through the blockchain system and

3863
02:57:15,660 --> 02:57:17,880
here we are going to apply the theme

3864
02:57:17,880 --> 02:57:20,640
essential that is the theme of follow the

3865
02:57:20,640 --> 02:57:23,520
money follows money because they are used

3866
02:57:23,520 --> 02:57:26,040
cryptocurrencies in the web bar good

3867
02:57:26,040 --> 02:57:27,479
They have many advantages due to

3868
02:57:27,479 --> 02:57:28,979
What is a non-centralized currency?

3869
02:57:28,979 --> 02:57:31,740
anyone can buy them and they are

3870
02:57:31,740 --> 02:57:33,300
anonymous Up to a certain level but

3871
02:57:33,300 --> 02:57:36,740
they really are anonymous

3872
02:57:37,439 --> 02:57:40,260
the transfers everything

3873
02:57:40,260 --> 02:57:41,700
make in blockchain is public is

3874
02:57:41,700 --> 02:57:44,340
publicly available to all if

3875
02:57:44,340 --> 02:57:46,140
we know Search So we can

3876
02:57:46,140 --> 02:57:47,880
find an account that is selling

3877
02:57:47,880 --> 02:57:51,300
and see what transactions you have made for

3878
02:57:51,300 --> 02:57:53,040
this we can do good explores like

3879
02:57:53,040 --> 02:57:56,340
they are Wall explorers blocks Explorer mi

3880
02:57:56,340 --> 02:57:58,340
Favourite

3881
02:57:58,340 --> 02:58:01,800
what do we have to look for the amount of

3882
02:58:01,800 --> 02:58:04,319
transactions this account has made

3883
02:58:04,319 --> 02:58:05,819
If you don't have any transaction Well

3884
02:58:05,819 --> 02:58:07,920
this is not a good sign the amount

3885
02:58:07,920 --> 02:58:09,660
of money that is moving if we

3886
02:58:09,660 --> 02:58:12,600
we are looking at an account that the

3887
02:58:12,600 --> 02:58:14,819
lowest product you sell is 500

3888
02:58:14,819 --> 02:58:17,000
dollars. But this person is

3889
02:58:17,000 --> 02:58:19,380
receiving money per transaction has

3890
02:58:19,380 --> 02:58:20,939
many transactions but none exceeded

3891
02:58:20,939 --> 02:58:22,740
the 50 dollars This can lead me to

3892
02:58:22,740 --> 02:58:24,420
to think that it is a person inflating

3893
02:58:24,420 --> 02:58:25,800
account not faking activity so that

3894
02:58:25,800 --> 02:58:28,140
looks like it's a legitimate account and for

3895
02:58:28,140 --> 02:58:30,120
last we can see what accounts he is with

3896
02:58:30,120 --> 02:58:31,920
interacting this account to get started

3897
02:58:31,920 --> 02:58:34,220
to identify other Wales that may

3898
02:58:34,220 --> 02:58:37,260
stay with the same person or what

3899
02:58:37,260 --> 02:58:39,180
defensive measures exist that we

3900
02:58:39,180 --> 02:58:41,700
we must know first are the

3901
02:58:41,700 --> 02:58:44,399
crypto tumblrs a crypto Tumblr is a

3902
02:58:44,399 --> 02:58:46,380
Public account to which people

3903
02:58:46,380 --> 02:58:50,220
they can transfer cryptos to you and you are going to

3904
02:58:50,220 --> 02:58:52,020
those crypts are going to mix between

3905
02:58:52,020 --> 02:58:54,420
all those that are being deposited and at

3906
02:58:54,420 --> 02:58:56,160
In the end, you will receive an account

3907
02:58:56,160 --> 02:58:58,200
an amount similar to what they deposit

3908
02:58:58,200 --> 02:59:00,960
is basically money laundering with

3909
02:59:00,960 --> 02:59:03,000
extra steps is not credit laundering

3910
02:59:03,000 --> 02:59:05,340
We also have investments that is to say I

3911
02:59:05,340 --> 02:59:07,319
I am a seller and I am receiving my

3912
02:59:07,319 --> 02:59:09,960
money in in monero de monero lo

3913
02:59:09,960 --> 02:59:11,279
transform bitcoin from bitcoin lo

3914
02:59:11,279 --> 02:59:12,720
transform ethereum and deterioration I become

3915
02:59:12,720 --> 02:59:14,399
with the bitcoin planets and that makes very

3916
02:59:14,399 --> 02:59:18,180
difficult to do the search and above all

3917
02:59:18,180 --> 02:59:20,399
what is sought is to try

3918
02:59:20,399 --> 02:59:22,319
break even the blockchain AND

3919
02:59:22,319 --> 02:59:24,060
Finally, there are people who use many

3920
02:59:24,060 --> 02:59:26,220
beads to make them more difficult to

3921
02:59:26,220 --> 02:59:29,760
trace this let's some examples in

3922
02:59:29,760 --> 02:59:31,800
this case I found a site that is

3923
02:59:31,800 --> 02:59:34,680
selling Herod How interesting in

3924
02:59:34,680 --> 02:59:37,020
In this case I am buying them a Zero

3925
02:59:37,020 --> 02:59:39,479
day for 400 dollars that is for

3926
02:59:39,479 --> 02:59:41,460
Instagram to access the

3927
02:59:41,460 --> 02:59:44,340
bills 400 dollars for a draft from there

3928
02:59:44,340 --> 02:59:46,439
for it is a good offer

3929
02:59:46,439 --> 02:59:49,080
and you can see that below the QR I am

3930
02:59:49,080 --> 02:59:50,640
getting the wallet address

3931
02:59:50,640 --> 02:59:53,279
wallets la wallet think of it like him

3932
02:59:53,279 --> 02:59:54,479
account number to which they are going

3933
02:59:54,479 --> 02:59:57,420
transfer and well you can see that in this

3934
02:59:57,420 --> 02:59:59,100
case this person is buying and

3935
02:59:59,100 --> 03:00:01,740
selling through bitcoins no

3936
03:00:01,740 --> 03:00:03,920
then

3937
03:00:05,100 --> 03:00:07,800
we can see the number of transactions

3938
03:00:07,800 --> 03:00:10,319
what is this account has done in this

3939
03:00:10,319 --> 03:00:12,720
case are two transactions and what for

3940
03:00:12,720 --> 03:00:15,740
me is more interesting is that

3941
03:00:15,740 --> 03:00:20,340
has transferred point 0.16 bitcoin but

3942
03:00:20,340 --> 03:00:22,500
that account that same day received a point

3943
03:00:22,500 --> 03:00:24,899
zero 16 bitcoins which leaves us with a

3944
03:00:24,899 --> 03:00:28,200
zero balance that's not a very bad

3945
03:00:28,200 --> 03:00:30,300
signal. And from that we can

3946
03:00:30,300 --> 03:00:33,479
determine that this is a scam or exists

3947
03:00:33,479 --> 03:00:36,180
otherwise This is such a scheme

3948
03:00:36,180 --> 03:00:37,740
elaborate that have many beads

3949
03:00:37,740 --> 03:00:39,960
different And they may offer us a

3950
03:00:39,960 --> 03:00:41,540
different account for each product

3951
03:00:41,540 --> 03:00:43,160
erasing

3952
03:00:43,160 --> 03:00:46,380
close the accounts offered to us

3953
03:00:46,380 --> 03:00:48,960
each customer then This is a sign

3954
03:00:48,960 --> 03:00:51,720
which can confuse us a bit

3955
03:00:51,720 --> 03:00:53,640
however after a little more than

3956
03:00:53,640 --> 03:00:55,500
investigation I was able to determine that

3957
03:00:55,500 --> 03:00:58,740
this is a scam this is a fraud

3958
03:00:58,740 --> 03:01:00,899
Here we have another example in which I

3959
03:01:00,899 --> 03:01:02,819
I am buying the database from My

3960
03:01:02,819 --> 03:01:04,740
fitness was a leak that occurred ago

3961
03:01:04,740 --> 03:01:06,779
some years I am buying 143

3962
03:01:06,779 --> 03:01:09,180
million accounts not these accounts

3963
03:01:09,180 --> 03:01:11,160
may contain user password

3964
03:01:11,160 --> 03:01:14,000
mail gps info blah blah blah

3965
03:01:14,000 --> 03:01:16,740
and here they are giving me the account of the

3966
03:01:16,740 --> 03:01:19,560
which one I want to transfer And that's a total

3967
03:01:19,560 --> 03:01:21,840
from 181 bitcoin no this is important

3968
03:01:21,840 --> 03:01:23,660
180,000 bitcoin what they are me

3969
03:01:23,660 --> 03:01:25,800
offering then here we can see that

3970
03:01:25,800 --> 03:01:28,319
this account has made 11 transactions has

3971
03:01:28,319 --> 03:01:31,859
received a total of 571 transactions and

3972
03:01:31,859 --> 03:01:36,180
has drawn 206 Sorry 571 dollars and has

3973
03:01:36,180 --> 03:01:38,460
removed 206 dollars with which leaves us

3974
03:01:38,460 --> 03:01:41,880
an active balance of $364 here the

3975
03:01:41,880 --> 03:01:43,979
prices do seem somewhat realistic we can

3976
03:01:43,979 --> 03:01:46,560
to think that this account has done five or

3977
03:01:46,560 --> 03:01:49,020
four sales and has an active balance

3978
03:01:49,020 --> 03:01:50,880
So this can lead us to think

3979
03:01:50,880 --> 03:01:52,920
That looks better, doesn't this have

3980
03:01:52,920 --> 03:01:55,080
better signs than the case we just

3981
03:01:55,080 --> 03:01:58,680
to see the siro day then

3982
03:01:58,680 --> 03:02:01,319
Here we can begin to investigate a

3983
03:02:01,319 --> 03:02:03,540
little more and well let's go with the last one

3984
03:02:03,540 --> 03:02:07,020
technique of the guide that is the finger I am

3985
03:02:07,020 --> 03:02:09,180
talking about any piece of

3986
03:02:09,180 --> 03:02:11,180
information that can help us

3987
03:02:11,180 --> 03:02:13,740
that are distinctive elements of this

3988
03:02:13,740 --> 03:02:16,080
site to which we may link you to

3989
03:02:16,080 --> 03:02:18,060
other sites don't. So it's a very

3990
03:02:18,060 --> 03:02:19,800
It is important to do the analysis of the

3991
03:02:19,800 --> 03:02:21,359
source code from which we can extract the

3992
03:02:21,359 --> 03:02:24,020
fire and comments in the with what we can

3993
03:02:24,020 --> 03:02:26,640
get the sum of md5 and look for it to

3994
03:02:26,640 --> 03:02:28,920
link it with sites in the clearned

3995
03:02:28,920 --> 03:02:30,840
we can cure our tools

3996
03:02:30,840 --> 03:02:33,300
trust as are emap and shodan yeah

3997
03:02:33,300 --> 03:02:35,100
in Maps there is a docker that helps us to

3998
03:02:35,100 --> 03:02:36,779
run it through the web bar or

3999
03:02:36,779 --> 03:02:38,580
we can take private fingerprints

4000
03:02:38,580 --> 03:02:41,580
from ssh and from http genes without

4001
03:02:41,580 --> 03:02:44,100
However this is sad because a

4002
03:02:44,100 --> 03:02:46,439
year the migration of the version occurred

4003
03:02:46,439 --> 03:02:49,319
v2 a of 3 Then the circuit of

4004
03:02:49,319 --> 03:02:50,880
unions that we are using on the day of

4005
03:02:50,880 --> 03:02:53,939
Today it's db3 and it's barely been a year since

4006
03:02:53,939 --> 03:02:56,939
in fact that happened the last time

4007
03:02:56,939 --> 03:03:01,080
It's already been talked about, so this is what

4008
03:03:01,080 --> 03:03:03,120
happened is that many of the tools or

4009
03:03:03,120 --> 03:03:04,979
known techniques are already inefficient

4010
03:03:04,979 --> 03:03:07,439
against the technique against the new

4011
03:03:07,439 --> 03:03:09,359
directions and that many tools

4012
03:03:09,359 --> 03:03:10,920
have been outdated by now

4013
03:03:10,920 --> 03:03:13,220
obviously there are many who are

4014
03:03:13,220 --> 03:03:14,819
contributing there in the projects

4015
03:03:14,819 --> 03:03:16,439
openers to be updating these

4016
03:03:16,439 --> 03:03:18,479
projects and I know that people don't take long

4017
03:03:18,479 --> 03:03:21,479
in inventing new techniques we are

4018
03:03:21,479 --> 03:03:25,160
hackers that's what we do then

4019
03:03:25,680 --> 03:03:27,899
How to differentiate a v2 address from a

4020
03:03:27,899 --> 03:03:29,220
direction v3 well the directions

4021
03:03:29,220 --> 03:03:31,080
v3 is already the normal thing we see today

4022
03:03:31,080 --> 03:03:33,359
and are longer while with a

4023
03:03:33,359 --> 03:03:34,920
address b2 to the mere had 8

4024
03:03:34,920 --> 03:03:37,560
characters v3 addresses already exceed

4025
03:03:37,560 --> 03:03:40,920
that By a lot This is how it looks like or the

4026
03:03:40,920 --> 03:03:42,660
fingerprinting of a two-yo service

4027
03:03:42,660 --> 03:03:44,819
luckily there between me my great

4028
03:03:44,819 --> 03:03:46,319
repertoire I managed to find a direction

4029
03:03:46,319 --> 03:03:49,740
v2 that is still active today and I

4030
03:03:49,740 --> 03:03:51,779
I managed to run this tool that doesn't

4031
03:03:51,779 --> 03:03:53,520
managed to extract information but so that

4032
03:03:53,520 --> 03:03:55,160
see how come

4033
03:03:55,160 --> 03:03:57,240
these techniques are seen No here we are

4034
03:03:57,240 --> 03:03:58,800
running it against different ports

4035
03:03:58,800 --> 03:04:01,740
we can see tls ssh and rc and we are

4036
03:04:01,740 --> 03:04:04,200
trying to get

4037
03:04:04,200 --> 03:04:06,600
particular traces that help us to

4038
03:04:06,600 --> 03:04:09,540
make up this service and something that Les

4039
03:04:09,540 --> 03:04:11,640
I highly recommend doing it alone

4040
03:04:11,640 --> 03:04:13,500
For fun, the comments travel

4041
03:04:13,500 --> 03:04:15,840
of the pages of the Dark web are going to

4042
03:04:15,840 --> 03:04:17,700
find great things in this case

4043
03:04:17,700 --> 03:04:19,680
I found a comment generated by

4044
03:04:19,680 --> 03:04:22,500
a program called HD truck if you guys

4045
03:04:22,500 --> 03:04:23,540
They carry

4046
03:04:23,540 --> 03:04:25,859
some if you started to shoot them

4047
03:04:25,859 --> 03:04:27,540
about 10 years ago in cybersecurity and

4048
03:04:27,540 --> 03:04:29,220
at that time they were interested in

4049
03:04:29,220 --> 03:04:31,020
Difficult topics I imagine you have already

4050
03:04:31,020 --> 03:04:33,060
heard of tracant It is a tool

4051
03:04:33,060 --> 03:04:34,920
that helps us clone sites About Us

4052
03:04:34,920 --> 03:04:37,680
we give her the URL and vaccinate her for

4053
03:04:37,680 --> 03:04:40,740
we So this can see that

4054
03:04:40,740 --> 03:04:42,779
here is the comment telling me that

4055
03:04:42,779 --> 03:04:44,819
it is super cloned and the original address

4056
03:04:44,819 --> 03:04:47,160
from which it was cloned So this me

4057
03:04:47,160 --> 03:04:50,220
can get to say two things one That

4058
03:04:50,220 --> 03:04:51,540
It is a false page that they are

4059
03:04:51,540 --> 03:04:52,859
cloning someone else to become

4060
03:04:52,859 --> 03:04:54,420
going through this person is not

4061
03:04:54,420 --> 03:04:56,520
identity implantation or two is a

4062
03:04:56,520 --> 03:04:58,020
page that has endorsements account

4063
03:04:58,020 --> 03:04:59,819
with mirrors this is the original version

4064
03:04:59,819 --> 03:05:01,439
and here what I am visiting is

4065
03:05:01,439 --> 03:05:03,060
mirror

4066
03:05:03,060 --> 03:05:05,580
And finally I want to talk to you about

4067
03:05:05,580 --> 03:05:07,260
matter of time very quickly of

4068
03:05:07,260 --> 03:05:10,200
a technique that helped me find

4069
03:05:10,200 --> 03:05:12,479
to a missing person some time ago

4070
03:05:12,479 --> 03:05:14,340
time in one of the etfs that I am going to

4071
03:05:14,340 --> 03:05:15,680
talk later

4072
03:05:15,680 --> 03:05:17,580
Here I am using which

4073
03:05:17,580 --> 03:05:19,380
it was possibly my favorite service of

4074
03:05:19,380 --> 03:05:21,060
the Dark web which sadly no longer

4075
03:05:21,060 --> 03:05:24,000
there is that it was a compilation

4076
03:05:24,000 --> 03:05:27,300
massive giant leaks

4077
03:05:27,300 --> 03:05:28,620
users and emails here can see that

4078
03:05:28,620 --> 03:05:30,960
What I am looking for is the

4079
03:05:30,960 --> 03:05:33,420
Cisco password 123 to keep the

4080
03:05:33,420 --> 03:05:35,880
More legal talk and he's going to give me a

4081
03:05:35,880 --> 03:05:38,700
giant amount of accounts that use that

4082
03:05:38,700 --> 03:05:39,960
password

4083
03:05:39,960 --> 03:05:42,899
here what we use is that

4084
03:05:42,899 --> 03:05:45,720
we managed to find a leak of a

4085
03:05:45,720 --> 03:05:47,580
mail from a missing person with

4086
03:05:47,580 --> 03:05:49,140
that same tool and that doesn't sound very

4087
03:05:49,140 --> 03:05:51,060
useful however where do you put

4088
03:05:51,060 --> 03:05:53,180
interesting is that if this person is

4089
03:05:53,180 --> 03:05:57,000
marked as missing in 2012

4090
03:05:57,000 --> 03:05:58,620
with the information we get from your

4091
03:05:58,620 --> 03:06:00,479
account we were able to deduce that the account

4092
03:06:00,479 --> 03:06:03,660
it was from 2014 two years after the

4093
03:06:03,660 --> 03:06:05,340
person had disappeared and they were not

4094
03:06:05,340 --> 03:06:06,960
those years specifically they just

4095
03:06:06,960 --> 03:06:08,340
I say a few years to exemplify

4096
03:06:08,340 --> 03:06:11,520
this already with this the leaks no

4097
03:06:11,520 --> 03:06:13,020
usually have users and

4098
03:06:13,020 --> 03:06:14,460
passwords but they come to have

4099
03:06:14,460 --> 03:06:17,160
sometimes even GPS information and

4100
03:06:17,160 --> 03:06:19,319
Well, here you can imagine the

4101
03:06:19,319 --> 03:06:21,540
next steps we took

4102
03:06:21,540 --> 03:06:23,640
briefly the molecule is that it mentions

4103
03:06:23,640 --> 03:06:25,319
at the beginning because you have to do it to

4104
03:06:25,319 --> 03:06:27,180
keep track of findings organize

4105
03:06:27,180 --> 03:06:29,340
streamline future processes identify

4106
03:06:29,340 --> 03:06:30,960
trusted sites and collaborate with

4107
03:06:30,960 --> 03:06:32,399
our colleagues how can we

4108
03:06:32,399 --> 03:06:34,560
do using simple things like is

4109
03:06:34,560 --> 03:06:37,020
keyte mongodb something very simple like

4110
03:06:37,020 --> 03:06:39,899
like Marc even free and what should we

4111
03:06:39,899 --> 03:06:41,700
to save the source information of

4112
03:06:41,700 --> 03:06:43,920
where did i find this union the union itself

4113
03:06:43,920 --> 03:06:45,960
the category if it is a marketplace forum

4114
03:06:45,960 --> 03:06:47,840
what is the title

4115
03:06:47,840 --> 03:06:50,580
the status is active inactive took it

4116
03:06:50,580 --> 03:06:52,439
police derivative sites or

4117
03:06:52,439 --> 03:06:54,720
particular fingerprints

4118
03:06:54,720 --> 03:06:57,180
and finally I want to talk to you about something

4119
03:06:57,180 --> 03:06:59,700
very important to me and where did it come from

4120
03:06:59,700 --> 03:07:01,620
this conversation and it is something with which I believe

4121
03:07:01,620 --> 03:07:04,380
faithfully that is the movement of ossing

4122
03:07:04,380 --> 03:07:06,060
for good we have great

4123
03:07:06,060 --> 03:07:07,920
knowledge great skills and

4124
03:07:07,920 --> 03:07:09,540
many times that stays on the side

4125
03:07:09,540 --> 03:07:11,160
technical and do not stay on the technical side

4126
03:07:11,160 --> 03:07:12,479
because we want to stay by the side

4127
03:07:12,479 --> 03:07:14,580
technical because we don't know ways in

4128
03:07:14,580 --> 03:07:16,319
which we can support in which

4129
03:07:16,319 --> 03:07:18,720
we can put a more humanitarian use to

4130
03:07:18,720 --> 03:07:20,479
what to what we know then

4131
03:07:20,479 --> 03:07:22,560
I invite you to collaborate with great

4132
03:07:22,560 --> 03:07:25,020
organizations such as three laps

4133
03:07:25,020 --> 03:07:27,720
three laps ago stf 1 a month four Good

4134
03:07:27,720 --> 03:07:29,040
Before it was six hours now it's already

4135
03:07:29,040 --> 03:07:31,140
four hours where they will give you cases of

4136
03:07:31,140 --> 03:07:33,060
real people who are today

4137
03:07:33,060 --> 03:07:35,220
disappeared and it will touch you to be

4138
03:07:35,220 --> 03:07:36,779
collaborating with law enforcement agencies

4139
03:07:36,779 --> 03:07:38,160
different countries doing

4140
03:07:38,160 --> 03:07:40,319
investigations again you see 100%

4141
03:07:40,319 --> 03:07:42,180
This is where I started and I know it

4142
03:07:42,180 --> 03:07:44,040
I wholeheartedly recommend There is also

4143
03:07:44,040 --> 03:07:47,520
things like the National and the location

4144
03:07:47,520 --> 03:07:49,260
underground Rain Road which is also

4145
03:07:49,260 --> 03:07:51,420
Looking for volunteers who can

4146
03:07:51,420 --> 03:07:53,460
use your abilities of or without to

4147
03:07:53,460 --> 03:07:56,760
in this case trafficking investigations

4148
03:07:56,760 --> 03:07:59,819
minors and finally there is the antihigiman

4149
03:07:59,819 --> 03:08:02,640
Traffic King intelligent initiative that

4150
03:08:02,640 --> 03:08:04,020
does something very similar to tres labs but

4151
03:08:04,020 --> 03:08:06,000
in this case they focus more on dealing with

4152
03:08:06,000 --> 03:08:08,279
people and has an event called give

4153
03:08:08,279 --> 03:08:10,080
huevaton which is a ctf where it is extracted

4154
03:08:10,080 --> 03:08:12,000
information only from the dark web

4155
03:08:12,000 --> 03:08:15,300
so I invite you very much to that in your

4156
03:08:15,300 --> 03:08:17,760
communities participate in these events

4157
03:08:17,760 --> 03:08:19,560

4158
03:08:19,560 --> 03:08:22,040

Salvador Nice to have you here

4182

indeed we can get at least one

4183
03:09:15,420 --> 03:09:18,779
little question we have many of the bases

4184
03:09:18,779 --> 03:09:20,880
arrive internally so that you can in

4185
03:09:20,880 --> 03:09:23,240
your networks answer them soon

4186
03:09:23,240 --> 03:09:27,060
let me choose one here is one says

4187
03:09:27,060 --> 03:09:28,620
What is the best place to find

4188
03:09:28,620 --> 03:09:31,439
information about the links and actually

4189
03:09:31,439 --> 03:09:33,300
if my company information or

4190
03:09:33,300 --> 03:09:36,260
people has been sold because

4191
03:09:36,260 --> 03:09:39,660
I highly recommend that you look for forums

4192
03:09:39,660 --> 03:09:43,080
first as they are creep TV who does not believe

4193
03:09:43,080 --> 03:09:44,000
to live

4194
03:09:44,000 --> 03:09:46,920
what are social networks are style forums

4195
03:09:46,920 --> 03:09:49,439
trading by Chan where there is a lot of talk about

4196
03:09:49,439 --> 03:09:51,899
this and there are already particular sections

4197
03:09:51,899 --> 03:09:54,720
where this is discussed there are many places

4198
03:09:54,720 --> 03:09:57,600
of intelligence exchange seek

4199
03:09:57,600 --> 03:09:59,700
also in those sites I recommend

4200
03:09:59,700 --> 03:10:02,060
to search using

4201
03:10:02,060 --> 03:10:05,100
search engines in particular amia can

4202
03:10:05,100 --> 03:10:06,840
search for company name or

4203
03:10:06,840 --> 03:10:08,880
simply go to Bridge go to link

4204
03:10:08,880 --> 03:10:13,500
with bolist how are you stay tuned to

4205
03:10:13,500 --> 03:10:15,240
Twitter can also search

4206
03:10:15,240 --> 03:10:17,880
in the cleaner in what used to be rate

4207
03:10:17,880 --> 03:10:19,500
forums that right now I don't remember how

4208
03:10:19,500 --> 03:10:21,960
It's called I think it's called Bridgeports

4209
03:10:21,960 --> 03:10:23,520
something like that is a cleaner site

4210
03:10:23,520 --> 03:10:25,740
Where is this kind of stuff talked about?

4211
03:10:25,740 --> 03:10:28,140
there was a b2 site there was a site

4212
03:10:28,140 --> 03:10:30,660
that existed in the b2 system that I don't know

4213
03:10:30,660 --> 03:10:33,240
if I have not managed to exist find in

4214
03:10:33,240 --> 03:10:36,120
the bet3 site but it was from inside se

4215
03:10:36,120 --> 03:10:38,700
called insider Intel I think and precisely

4216
03:10:38,700 --> 03:10:40,500
they talked about these issues but just

4217
03:10:40,500 --> 03:10:43,200
this one spoke of briches but rather

4218
03:10:43,200 --> 03:10:44,580
He was talking about other types of information

4219
03:10:44,580 --> 03:10:45,779
could have just been found

4220
03:10:45,779 --> 03:10:48,240
for Brazil to speed up processes

4221
03:10:48,240 --> 03:10:51,060
of malicious attacks then Those are

4222
03:10:51,060 --> 03:10:52,560
my recommendations look a lot for the

4223
03:10:52,560 --> 03:10:54,720
forums and use search engines

4224
03:10:54,720 --> 03:10:57,180
browsers to search sites

4225
03:10:57,180 --> 03:10:59,279
individuals through keywords for

4226
03:10:59,279 --> 03:11:00,960
investigate topics that you

4227
03:11:00,960 --> 03:11:02,880
Are you interested then well I hope

4228
03:11:02,880 --> 03:11:05,340
I hope this helps you

4229
03:11:05,340 --> 03:11:07,500
good Salvador Thank you very much for your

4230
03:11:07,500 --> 03:11:09,300
share next then

4231
03:11:09,300 --> 03:11:10,979
We continue with our programming

4232
03:11:10,979 --> 03:11:14,220
we have from chile to Ricardo Montreal

4233
03:11:14,220 --> 03:11:15,359
who is going to tell us a bit about

4234
03:11:15,359 --> 03:11:19,380
investigations not on age or

4235
03:11:19,380 --> 03:11:22,380
Deep web as they told us before but

4236
03:11:22,380 --> 03:11:25,859
specifically about an end which is a

4237
03:11:25,859 --> 03:11:27,540
of the techniques most used by

4238
03:11:27,540 --> 03:11:28,680
computer criminals for

4239
03:11:28,680 --> 03:11:30,840
engage both people and

4240
03:11:30,840 --> 03:11:34,620

4241

nature and very interesting precisely the

We are already seeing your screen but I think

4262
03:12:23,760 --> 03:12:27,680
what is the extended monitor then

4265
03:12:37,439 --> 03:12:40,680
Meanwhile, don't forget that we are

4266
03:12:40,680 --> 03:12:42,300

different licenses and have not won

4273
03:12:56,880 --> 03:12:58,439
still have plenty of opportunities

4274
03:12:58,439 --> 03:13:00,479
win we have very good licenses to

4279
03:13:09,439 --> 03:13:12,540
Well, they are losing a lot of

4280
03:13:12,540 --> 03:13:15,660
the activity I don't know if we still have

4281

4283
03:13:19,800 --> 03:13:23,720
to make some announcements

4284
03:13:23,720 --> 03:13:26,399
parochial while Ricardo solve

4285
03:13:26,399 --> 03:13:28,620
there the technical issue initially

4286
03:13:28,620 --> 03:13:31,880
true So what I'm going to do is

4287

agenda who am I why end because the

4366
03:17:22,920 --> 03:17:27,000
Fiching How to make other sites and what

4367
03:17:27,000 --> 03:17:28,200
depth of this talk the interesting

4368
03:17:28,200 --> 03:17:30,960
this talk is that we are going to

4369
03:17:30,960 --> 03:17:33,660
focus on going a little further with

4370
03:17:33,660 --> 03:17:35,760
the fittings not only say that it is

4371
03:17:35,760 --> 03:17:37,200
a file but a team more we can do

4372
03:17:37,200 --> 03:17:39,180
with this type of attack that are common

4373
03:17:39,180 --> 03:17:40,620
through the city delinquents as they said

4374
03:17:40,620 --> 03:17:41,939
before

4375
03:17:41,939 --> 03:17:45,359
And not only that but to advance and define

4376
03:17:45,359 --> 03:17:47,760
criminal groups behind these guys

4377
03:17:47,760 --> 03:17:49,680
of feiching criminal groups that are

4378
03:17:49,680 --> 03:17:52,279
organized that have

4379
03:17:52,279 --> 03:17:55,140
many people probably behind

4380
03:17:55,140 --> 03:17:58,380
And that these people have their objectives

4381
03:17:58,380 --> 03:18:00,479
individuals

4382
03:18:00,479 --> 03:18:02,520
quickly who am I not

4383
03:18:02,520 --> 03:18:04,859
draw us a lot Ricardo Monreal I have

4384
03:18:04,859 --> 03:18:07,140
more than 10 years in cybersecurity

4385
03:18:07,140 --> 03:18:09,180
working mainly in Chile I have

4386
03:18:09,180 --> 03:18:13,380
a masters at kings college or scp he

4387
03:18:13,380 --> 03:18:16,260
worked in several areas but more than

4388
03:18:16,260 --> 03:18:18,779
my particular work here I want

4389
03:18:18,779 --> 03:18:22,080
present to the finsín foundation that the

4390
03:18:22,080 --> 03:18:23,520
fine foundation the foundation i

4391
03:18:23,520 --> 03:18:24,979
offered here in Chile

4392
03:18:24,979 --> 03:18:26,760
dedicated to security research

4393
03:18:26,760 --> 03:18:28,800
computer there are my contacts for

4394
03:18:28,800 --> 03:18:31,140
if you want to review or communicate

4395
03:18:31,140 --> 03:18:33,060
with me there is no problem on github

4396
03:18:33,060 --> 03:18:36,080
I have little activity but the code that

4397
03:18:36,080 --> 03:18:40,439
generate and share I share it out there

4398
03:18:40,439 --> 03:18:45,120
and precisely what is pinsin finsín is the

4399
03:18:45,120 --> 03:18:46,439
security research foundation

4400
03:18:46,439 --> 03:18:49,140
computing is a technical nemo man

4401
03:18:49,140 --> 03:18:52,040
So it's not much creativity in that

4402
03:18:52,040 --> 03:18:54,740
we want to be a point of contact today

4403
03:18:54,740 --> 03:18:58,859
between companies here in chile and in the

4404
03:18:58,859 --> 03:19:01,380
potential vulnerability flaws that

4405
03:19:01,380 --> 03:19:03,240
we investigate or other people

4406
03:19:03,240 --> 03:19:05,640
investigate if someone wants to anonymize

4407
03:19:05,640 --> 03:19:07,740
your research or avoid some

4408
03:19:07,740 --> 03:19:09,180
repercussions can use us

4409
03:19:09,180 --> 03:19:11,060
as point of contact with companies

4410
03:19:11,060 --> 03:19:13,620
In addition we generate articles of

4411
03:19:13,620 --> 03:19:15,920
research

4412
03:19:16,040 --> 03:19:18,060
we deploy to certain platforms that

4413
03:19:18,060 --> 03:19:20,000
Today we have them available to the public and

4414
03:19:20,000 --> 03:19:22,319
mainly us as a foundation

4415
03:19:22,319 --> 03:19:24,479
we want to share information share

4416
03:19:24,479 --> 03:19:26,220
information with the general public

4417
03:19:26,220 --> 03:19:30,500
in Chile as in all Latin America

4418
03:19:31,520 --> 03:19:34,939
what platforms we have developed good

4419
03:19:34,939 --> 03:19:37,800
we have not developed as much

4420
03:19:37,800 --> 03:19:40,380
we implement a miss that a platform

4421
03:19:40,380 --> 03:19:43,439
of training exchange in the

4422
03:19:43,439 --> 03:19:45,720
first platform in Chile that can

4423
03:19:45,720 --> 03:19:47,840
be opened and reviewed by

4424
03:19:47,840 --> 03:19:50,120
anyone is a platform

4425
03:19:50,120 --> 03:19:53,100
closed on users but open on

4426
03:19:53,100 --> 03:19:54,540
the information we share all the

4427
03:19:54,540 --> 03:19:55,979
information but closed users

4428
03:19:55,979 --> 03:19:58,560
so that it does not get contaminated

4429
03:19:58,560 --> 03:20:01,140
information and the platform we come from

4430
03:20:01,140 --> 03:20:03,359
to present today is fiching

4431
03:20:03,359 --> 03:20:04,620
catcher is a detection platform

4432
03:20:04,620 --> 03:20:07,439
of fittings that takes a little more than 8

4433
03:20:07,439 --> 03:20:09,779
months in operation

4434
03:20:09,779 --> 03:20:13,140
and allows us to classify and group and

4435
03:20:13,140 --> 03:20:16,500
order the ones that we are detecting good

4436
03:20:16,500 --> 03:20:19,080
This is the platform of my defense and

4437
03:20:19,080 --> 03:20:21,359
This is a link to the platform

4438
03:20:21,359 --> 03:20:22,380
fitting we have today

4439
03:20:22,380 --> 03:20:24,740
running

4440
03:20:25,200 --> 03:20:28,100
and the big question why fishing

4441
03:20:28,100 --> 03:20:30,359
Why do we care in any way?

4442
03:20:30,359 --> 03:20:33,500
check the fittings Good

4443
03:20:33,500 --> 03:20:36,180
before anything anything

4444
03:20:36,180 --> 03:20:39,359
image or similarity of name that is seen

4445
03:20:39,359 --> 03:20:41,520
of the companies does not mean that

4446
03:20:41,520 --> 03:20:43,859
brand is negligent in some way but

4447
03:20:43,859 --> 03:20:45,960
that he is a victim of a clone of

4448
03:20:45,960 --> 03:20:47,220
picture

4449
03:20:47,220 --> 03:20:49,859
It is not that the company has been violated

4450
03:20:49,859 --> 03:20:51,420
or hacked in some way to send

4451
03:20:51,420 --> 03:20:53,939
invalid emails but the attackers

4452
03:20:53,939 --> 03:20:55,979
or criminals who are cloning the

4453
03:20:55,979 --> 03:20:57,660
image to use within your

4454
03:20:57,660 --> 03:20:59,899
bells

4455
03:21:00,720 --> 03:21:04,260
So what is the end is a scam that

4456
03:21:04,260 --> 03:21:07,080
look for fish there the name fiching is what

4457
03:21:07,080 --> 03:21:08,399
that they We call here in Chile

4458
03:21:08,399 --> 03:21:10,380
a tale of Uncle digitally Y

4459
03:21:10,380 --> 03:21:12,840
arrived in the mail mainly with the

4460
03:21:12,840 --> 03:21:16,080
main objective of stealing your data

4461
03:21:16,080 --> 03:21:18,060
and we want to differentiate the fitting from the

4462
03:21:18,060 --> 03:21:20,399
which is commonly called bad spam that

4463
03:21:20,399 --> 03:21:22,500
they are also malicious emails somehow

4464
03:21:22,500 --> 03:21:25,340
shape but the aim of the mouse is

4465
03:21:25,340 --> 03:21:27,359
get infected with a virus and the goal

4466
03:21:27,359 --> 03:21:30,800
fishing is stealing your data

4467
03:21:32,240 --> 03:21:34,279
if we see

4468
03:21:34,279 --> 03:21:38,720
there are different types of filing

4469
03:21:38,720 --> 03:21:41,340
And what these are trying to find is that

4470
03:21:41,340 --> 03:21:43,319
your actions or reactions to that email

4471
03:21:43,319 --> 03:21:45,840
with a link and that link go to

4472
03:21:45,840 --> 03:21:47,479
some page to insert your data

4473
03:21:47,479 --> 03:21:49,760
then

4474
03:21:49,760 --> 03:21:52,020
different types of mail with different

4475
03:21:52,020 --> 03:21:53,580
types of action but they all have a

4476
03:21:53,580 --> 03:21:56,340
button that says reset your password

4477
03:21:56,340 --> 03:21:59,960
or rejects a certain package or

4478
03:21:59,960 --> 03:22:02,520
reject someone's bank transaction

4479
03:22:02,520 --> 03:22:05,160
bank And that implies that you are not going to

4480
03:22:05,160 --> 03:22:06,660
download nothing but you're going to try

4481
03:22:06,660 --> 03:22:08,220
go to the page of the bank of the

4482
03:22:08,220 --> 03:22:10,200
institution or system that is for

4483
03:22:10,200 --> 03:22:12,300
change your passwords or reject the

4484
03:22:12,300 --> 03:22:13,979
key

4485
03:22:13,979 --> 03:22:16,620
These are extra emails I want you to

4486
03:22:16,620 --> 03:22:17,760
they try to do is that you download

4487
03:22:17,760 --> 03:22:20,340
some kind of PDF or download some

4488
03:22:20,340 --> 03:22:21,899
photo or download some type of file

4489
03:22:21,899 --> 03:22:24,479
for you to do something and in that

4490
03:22:24,479 --> 03:22:27,540
you download what they try to infect you

4491
03:22:27,540 --> 03:22:29,279
and that's why we want to separate those two

4492
03:22:29,279 --> 03:22:31,560
types of malicious emails because we go

4493
03:22:31,560 --> 03:22:33,420
to investigate the first

4494
03:22:33,420 --> 03:22:36,240
What are the risks of fitting

4495
03:22:36,240 --> 03:22:37,800
typical as they will have your

4496
03:22:37,800 --> 03:22:39,180
credentials is going to be a shot

4497
03:22:39,180 --> 03:22:40,859
control either of your email account

4498
03:22:40,859 --> 03:22:43,020
a domain account an account

4499
03:22:43,020 --> 03:22:45,180
banking what here in Chile we call

4500
03:22:45,180 --> 03:22:46,620
unique key your identification account

4501
03:22:46,620 --> 03:22:48,779
to government systems

4502
03:22:48,779 --> 03:22:51,180
in general they look for impersonal your

4503
03:22:51,180 --> 03:22:53,660
digital identity

4504
03:22:54,060 --> 03:22:55,800
and we return to the same questions why

4505
03:22:55,800 --> 03:22:58,020
fishing because it is a very

4506
03:22:58,020 --> 03:22:59,340
common

4507
03:22:59,340 --> 03:23:01,399
today if one searches Twitter

4508
03:23:01,399 --> 03:23:05,580
directly in the most basic of the field

4509
03:23:05,580 --> 03:23:08,120
search top messages spaces

4510
03:23:08,120 --> 03:23:10,500
daily we have many people who

4511
03:23:10,500 --> 03:23:12,300
are claiming each of their

4512
03:23:12,300 --> 03:23:14,100
institutions that are reaching you

4513
03:23:14,100 --> 03:23:16,439
certain fitting messages and either by

4514
03:23:16,439 --> 03:23:19,140
mail or by message or by WhatsApp

4515
03:23:19,140 --> 03:23:22,200
and detects that it is a hoax and urges his

4516
03:23:22,200 --> 03:23:23,520
institutions to do something to

4517
03:23:23,520 --> 03:23:24,899
regard

4518
03:23:24,899 --> 03:23:27,840
And so far, as we have seen, it has not been

4519
03:23:27,840 --> 03:23:29,420
take this issue very seriously

4520
03:23:29,420 --> 03:23:32,100
only the Take down or the loss of

4521
03:23:32,100 --> 03:23:33,540
the fastest fiching sites

4522
03:23:33,540 --> 03:23:36,060
possible but there is little research on

4523
03:23:36,060 --> 03:23:38,100
about it there is not much to know what is

4524
03:23:38,100 --> 03:23:39,720
going on with this kit what is

4525
03:23:39,720 --> 03:23:42,500
going through that problem

4526
03:23:43,680 --> 03:23:45,020
Us

4527
03:23:45,020 --> 03:23:48,120
we have had as all I assume many

4528
03:23:48,120 --> 03:23:49,439
problems with the end several years ago

4529
03:23:49,439 --> 03:23:51,120
behind

4530
03:23:51,120 --> 03:23:53,399
And we begin to detect certain patterns

4531
03:23:53,399 --> 03:23:55,739
similar in different types of urls

4532
03:23:55,739 --> 03:23:58,020
fiching are different domains for

4533
03:23:58,020 --> 03:23:59,460
different campaigns but patterns

4534
03:23:59,460 --> 03:24:01,800
Similar

4535
03:24:01,800 --> 03:24:04,080
and there we begin to detect that not only

4536
03:24:04,080 --> 03:24:05,460
are the patterns similar but

4537
03:24:05,460 --> 03:24:07,680
we started to find kits called

4538
03:24:07,680 --> 03:24:10,140
kitshing that is beginning to appear that

4539
03:24:10,140 --> 03:24:12,600
they are the same codes from behind that

4540
03:24:12,600 --> 03:24:15,000
are the same images are the same

4541
03:24:15,000 --> 03:24:18,239
php or js files or whatever and that is

4542
03:24:18,239 --> 03:24:21,060
they start repeating then

4543
03:24:21,060 --> 03:24:23,220
We focus on this problem with the

4544
03:24:23,220 --> 03:24:25,380
objective of searching for fitting sites

4545
03:24:25,380 --> 03:24:28,319
How are they? How are they assembled? How are they?

4546
03:24:28,319 --> 03:24:30,779
working from behind to see what

4547
03:24:30,779 --> 03:24:32,460
patterns are repeated and what patterns are not

4548
03:24:32,460 --> 03:24:34,200
repeat and what is other information

4549
03:24:34,200 --> 03:24:36,120
we can have

4550
03:24:36,120 --> 03:24:38,279
What if we can find the

4551
03:24:38,279 --> 03:24:39,960
scam victims

4552
03:24:39,960 --> 03:24:42,840
of each fishing scam we can help

4553
03:24:42,840 --> 03:24:45,479
the institution to alert its

4554
03:24:45,479 --> 03:24:46,859
victims

4555
03:24:46,859 --> 03:24:49,220
or what if we can find

4556
03:24:49,220 --> 03:24:51,540
driver information

4557
03:24:51,540 --> 03:24:52,979
scam those who are two figures

4558
03:24:52,979 --> 03:24:54,120
criminals who are carrying this

4559
03:24:54,120 --> 03:24:56,760
scam from behind there we began to have

4560
03:24:56,760 --> 03:24:59,420
much more information and much more value

4561
03:24:59,420 --> 03:25:03,620
to investigate each of these

4562
03:25:04,140 --> 03:25:06,600
let's start with something initial how are these

4563
03:25:06,600 --> 03:25:09,420
sites in general have been mutating with the

4564
03:25:09,420 --> 03:25:10,160
weather

4565
03:25:10,160 --> 03:25:13,140
the first fishing attacks on the

4566
03:25:13,140 --> 03:25:14,700
first fitting emails to arrive

4567
03:25:14,700 --> 03:25:17,100
they had as it appears down there I don't know if

4568
03:25:17,100 --> 03:25:20,239
can see a URL fine with

4569
03:25:20,239 --> 03:25:23,100
an absolutely horrible link with a

4570
03:25:23,100 --> 03:25:24,720
bunch of characters that don't have

4571
03:25:24,720 --> 03:25:27,500
no sense with the affected brand

4572
03:25:27,500 --> 03:25:30,060
in this case nowhere says Netflix

4573
03:25:30,060 --> 03:25:32,040
in the link not even at the beginning in

4574
03:25:32,040 --> 03:25:34,020
the end therefore one is scared and

4575
03:25:34,020 --> 03:25:37,859
says ok as they have taught me in others

4576
03:25:37,859 --> 03:25:39,720
previous capsules if i want to know which one

4577
03:25:39,720 --> 03:25:42,600
It is the link of an email I put the mouse

4578
03:25:42,600 --> 03:25:44,220
on the link and it appears below and that

4579
03:25:44,220 --> 03:25:46,560
It has nothing to do with Netflix because

4580
03:25:46,560 --> 03:25:49,560
I don't click so much

4581
03:25:49,560 --> 03:25:51,500
So like cybercriminals

4582
03:25:51,500 --> 03:25:53,580
knew or understood this problem

4583
03:25:53,580 --> 03:25:55,560
mutated

4584
03:25:55,560 --> 03:25:58,920
and now they started using cutters

4585
03:25:58,920 --> 03:26:01,260
shorteners Generally brands or

4586
03:26:01,260 --> 03:26:04,439
known sites Like bitley and with these

4587
03:26:04,439 --> 03:26:06,479
shorteners it is possible to minimize the fright

4588
03:26:06,479 --> 03:26:07,800
of the people who are receiving this

4589
03:26:07,800 --> 03:26:10,160
mail because for example

4590
03:26:10,160 --> 03:26:12,960
bitly has a feature that for me more

4591
03:26:12,960 --> 03:26:15,180
a pack than a picture but this fixture

4592
03:26:15,180 --> 03:26:17,880
says that you can add to the end of the

4593
03:26:17,880 --> 03:26:19,979
link after the question mark or

4594
03:26:19,979 --> 03:26:22,319
placing another character than them

4595
03:26:22,319 --> 03:26:25,140
ignore any text any text

4596
03:26:25,140 --> 03:26:26,819
whatever is posing as the brand

4597
03:26:26,819 --> 03:26:28,380
So in this case they add the mark

4598
03:26:28,380 --> 03:26:30,840
at the end of the bitly bitly link

4599
03:26:30,840 --> 03:26:32,640
recognizes that the first part what

4600
03:26:32,640 --> 03:26:34,859
have to redirect and move forward without

4601
03:26:34,859 --> 03:26:37,979
problems with the same link

4602
03:26:37,979 --> 03:26:41,040
but still when

4603
03:26:41,040 --> 03:26:42,720
each of the institutions begins to

4604
03:26:42,720 --> 03:26:45,120
say we do not send links or the

4605
03:26:45,120 --> 03:26:46,739
people start to get scared by the bitly

4606
03:26:46,739 --> 03:26:49,080
start to grow a little more

4607
03:26:49,080 --> 03:26:52,279
complexity of these sites

4608
03:26:52,439 --> 03:26:54,540
today we have sites that make a

4609
03:26:54,540 --> 03:26:56,040
complexity of at least six layers

4610
03:26:56,040 --> 03:26:59,939
between the original link and the final link and

4611
03:26:59,939 --> 03:27:01,939
the more layers, the more resilient

4612
03:27:01,939 --> 03:27:05,399
resilient in the sense that if they vote

4613
03:27:05,399 --> 03:27:06,899
part of the architecture or

4614
03:27:06,899 --> 03:27:08,580
infrastructure we can change it for

4615
03:27:08,580 --> 03:27:11,399
another and stays at a certain certain

4616
03:27:11,399 --> 03:27:13,140
certain stability in each of these

4617
03:27:13,140 --> 03:27:15,979
attacks and these campaigns

4618
03:27:16,560 --> 03:27:18,660
We start from an original link of a bitly

4619
03:27:18,660 --> 03:27:20,700
we generate a redirect to a site that

4620
03:27:20,700 --> 03:27:22,319
we control what generates another

4621
03:27:22,319 --> 03:27:24,300
redirection to another bitly that generates Another

4622
03:27:24,300 --> 03:27:25,979
redirection now we do control that

4623
03:27:25,979 --> 03:27:28,800
generates another redirection and with that

4624
03:27:28,800 --> 03:27:30,180
we have several points where we

4625
03:27:30,180 --> 03:27:32,700
we can say Ok if they give me

4626
03:27:32,700 --> 03:27:34,500
download the final site there is no

4627
03:27:34,500 --> 03:27:36,420
problem because the redirection changes

4628
03:27:36,420 --> 03:27:37,680
former

4629
03:27:37,680 --> 03:27:39,319
and with that the

4630
03:27:39,319 --> 03:27:41,640
cybercriminals can keep a

4631
03:27:41,640 --> 03:27:44,580
campaign for a long time with little with

4632
03:27:44,580 --> 03:27:47,120
quite a small investment

4633
03:27:47,120 --> 03:27:48,859
then

4634
03:27:48,859 --> 03:27:51,060
seeing this evolution of the sites of

4635
03:27:51,060 --> 03:27:52,859
fishing a little How they have been improving

4636
03:27:52,859 --> 03:27:55,319
ways to attack people

4637
03:27:55,319 --> 03:27:58,760
We ask how to make a site like this

4638
03:27:59,399 --> 03:28:02,300
in general they are needed

4639
03:28:02,300 --> 03:28:04,620
refers to the code behind

4640
03:28:04,620 --> 03:28:06,660
And he makes the interpretation of each one of

4641
03:28:06,660 --> 03:28:07,580
the

4642
03:28:07,580 --> 03:28:09,779
commands or interactions that are made

4643
03:28:09,779 --> 03:28:12,540
with the site in general it does not matter or not

4644
03:28:12,540 --> 03:28:13,560
language matters a lot

4645
03:28:13,560 --> 03:28:16,439
programming the most common is always php

4646
03:28:16,439 --> 03:28:17,960
why

4647
03:28:17,960 --> 03:28:21,060
Unfortunately there are many wordpress

4648
03:28:21,060 --> 03:28:22,680
vulnerable and many wordpress that have

4649
03:28:22,680 --> 03:28:25,620
been compromised. So it's a good

4650
03:28:25,620 --> 03:28:27,680
source of of

4651
03:28:27,680 --> 03:28:30,439
free platforms that is

4652
03:28:30,439 --> 03:28:32,279
free in the sense that someone else

4653
03:28:32,279 --> 03:28:35,160
is paying for it and one can reach

4654
03:28:35,160 --> 03:28:36,439
compromise your wordpress site to

4655
03:28:36,439 --> 03:28:39,560
have part of your platform

4656
03:28:39,560 --> 03:28:41,640
of the fitting architecture

4657
03:28:41,640 --> 03:28:43,620
running

4658
03:28:43,620 --> 03:28:45,840
one can work from scratch with a

4659
03:28:45,840 --> 03:28:47,220
developer

4660
03:28:47,220 --> 03:28:49,620
where you ask Give me they put together a kit

4661
03:28:49,620 --> 03:28:53,520
fiction but the most common is to reuse

4662
03:28:53,520 --> 03:28:56,399
known fitting kits and having

4663
03:28:56,399 --> 03:28:59,960
known fitting kits one can

4664
03:29:00,120 --> 03:29:03,080
ask what is a

4665
03:29:03,080 --> 03:29:05,160
pre-made development that can be

4666
03:29:05,160 --> 03:29:06,960
re-use

4667
03:29:06,960 --> 03:29:08,580
The idea is to activate it as quickly as possible.

4668
03:29:08,580 --> 03:29:12,420
possible with minimal configuration

4669
03:29:12,420 --> 03:29:16,739
and when you have a person that I have not

4670
03:29:16,739 --> 03:29:18,300
developer or does not know how to code

4671
03:29:18,300 --> 03:29:19,800
generally non-criminals

4672
03:29:19,800 --> 03:29:22,260
they know the code, do they buy the kit or

4673
03:29:22,260 --> 03:29:24,899
get in the kit with someone else you

4674
03:29:24,899 --> 03:29:26,160
Do you think that person who does not know the

4675
03:29:26,160 --> 03:29:28,319
code with minimal interaction can

4676
03:29:28,319 --> 03:29:31,800
configure the kit or the site to your liking

4677
03:29:31,800 --> 03:29:33,300
of fitting as you like if you change the

4678
03:29:33,300 --> 03:29:34,979
domain or change a path or change a

4679
03:29:34,979 --> 03:29:37,500
mail that is easy of that change and not

4680
03:29:37,500 --> 03:29:38,939
have to change all the code

4681
03:29:38,939 --> 03:29:40,260
place

4682
03:29:40,260 --> 03:29:43,319
so well user friendly let's say

4683
03:29:43,319 --> 03:29:45,479
some way and it comes prepared

4684
03:29:45,479 --> 03:29:48,319
Generally with several ugly ones with several

4685
03:29:48,319 --> 03:29:51,479
extra things for example geolocation

4686
03:29:51,479 --> 03:29:53,460
or geofensing where you have to

4687
03:29:53,460 --> 03:29:55,020
fishing kit can only be

4688
03:29:55,020 --> 03:29:57,540
visited from certain countries or the

4689
03:29:57,540 --> 03:29:59,279
affected countries

4690
03:29:59,279 --> 03:30:01,979
has antibots tabs where the

4691
03:30:01,979 --> 03:30:03,540
Google voice Bots of certain types

4692
03:30:03,540 --> 03:30:04,220
of

4693
03:30:04,220 --> 03:30:08,279
scans blocks them has notification

4694
03:30:08,279 --> 03:30:10,439
of the victims When someone falls into the

4695
03:30:10,439 --> 03:30:13,439
in the scam notifies you by mail or

4696
03:30:13,439 --> 03:30:16,080
connections with Telegram and has a panel

4697
03:30:16,080 --> 03:30:18,359
administration website Generally local

4698
03:30:18,359 --> 03:30:21,660
in the same kit

4699
03:30:21,660 --> 03:30:23,580
and there we enter with the

4700
03:30:23,580 --> 03:30:25,080
platform

4701
03:30:25,080 --> 03:30:27,120
is a kit detection platform or

4702
03:30:27,120 --> 03:30:30,300
of packs and the idea is to get a little more

4703
03:30:30,300 --> 03:30:32,220
beyond the simple Take down and give more

4704
03:30:32,220 --> 03:30:34,580
information

4705
03:30:34,620 --> 03:30:36,779
What happens if we detect that a

4706
03:30:36,779 --> 03:30:39,660
same fitting site

4707
03:30:39,660 --> 03:30:42,060
has a specific pack and the site

4708
03:30:42,060 --> 03:30:44,160
of the following has the same pack and the

4709
03:30:44,160 --> 03:30:45,479
next site has the same pack

4710
03:30:45,479 --> 03:30:47,760
we can have a trend we can

4711
03:30:47,760 --> 03:30:50,160
group all these same sites of

4712
03:30:50,160 --> 03:30:53,340
fixing on a single campaign even more so if

4713
03:30:53,340 --> 03:30:56,460
they have the same the same type of company

4714
03:30:56,460 --> 03:30:59,100
affected If all are from the same bank or

4715
03:30:59,100 --> 03:31:02,399
of the same retail we can say that in the

4716
03:31:02,399 --> 03:31:03,660
same campaign from the same person

4717
03:31:03,660 --> 03:31:05,420
is behind with a high probability

4718
03:31:05,420 --> 03:31:08,340
but apart from knowing that it is the same kit

4719
03:31:08,340 --> 03:31:10,680
from fitting we can know what

4720
03:31:10,680 --> 03:31:12,239
vulnerabilities that kit has

4721
03:31:12,239 --> 03:31:14,580
fiching to be able to attack them and with that

4722
03:31:14,580 --> 03:31:17,220
we can find relevant information

4723
03:31:17,220 --> 03:31:19,560
for the delinquent that we can

4724
03:31:19,560 --> 03:31:22,340
know it too

4725
03:31:22,800 --> 03:31:25,620
So I'll see if it allows me

4726
03:31:25,620 --> 03:31:28,620
to share

4727
03:31:30,239 --> 03:31:33,380
the second good page

4728
03:31:36,000 --> 03:31:38,160
I want to show a little how is the

4729
03:31:38,160 --> 03:31:41,300
platform today

4730
03:31:43,760 --> 03:31:47,700
you see my website

4731
03:31:47,700 --> 03:31:50,700
perfect

4732
03:31:51,540 --> 03:31:54,899
I understand that it can be ugly but not here

4733
03:31:54,899 --> 03:31:57,960
we are very experts in USA experience nor

4734
03:31:57,960 --> 03:32:00,359
in styles. But the idea is that you

4735
03:32:00,359 --> 03:32:01,340
you can see that there was a page

4736
03:32:01,340 --> 03:32:05,340
quite simple that in fact this is

4737
03:32:05,340 --> 03:32:08,460
Live now in the list of the last in

4738
03:32:08,460 --> 03:32:10,560
the last reviews we have done and

4739
03:32:10,560 --> 03:32:14,220
we have three types of results

4740
03:32:14,220 --> 03:32:16,859
the normal result which means no

4741
03:32:16,859 --> 03:32:18,180
we have been able to have any kind of

4742
03:32:18,180 --> 03:32:20,880
definition in this regard that we do not know if

4743
03:32:20,880 --> 03:32:22,739
is it a fiching or not most likely it is

4744
03:32:22,739 --> 03:32:23,779
that is not

4745
03:32:23,779 --> 03:32:26,399
suspicious implies that we have something

4746
03:32:26,399 --> 03:32:28,140
suspect this may be a site

4747
03:32:28,140 --> 03:32:31,500
fixing or declared in red that for real

4748
03:32:31,500 --> 03:32:34,020
It is a site

4749
03:32:34,020 --> 03:32:35,700
and with these three categories we go

4750
03:32:35,700 --> 03:32:38,460
working in general. If you look at the

4751
03:32:38,460 --> 03:32:39,840
back history there are a lot of

4752
03:32:39,840 --> 03:32:42,000
errors. Because still the platform

4753
03:32:42,000 --> 03:32:43,620
They are in beta and we are polishing several

4754
03:32:43,620 --> 03:32:46,880
of the errors but we have high

4755
03:32:46,880 --> 03:32:50,060
detection levels for example

4756
03:32:50,060 --> 03:32:52,160
here we have the

4757
03:32:52,160 --> 03:32:56,760
antepenultimate that if they click on the a

4758
03:32:56,760 --> 03:32:58,859
the box itself we can see that it is a

4759
03:32:58,859 --> 03:33:02,580
URL that does look a lot like

4760
03:33:02,580 --> 03:33:05,720
some banking company in Colombia and

4761
03:33:05,720 --> 03:33:09,020
is a domain ending in replay.com

4762
03:33:09,020 --> 03:33:12,060
what is a upload platform

4763
03:33:12,060 --> 03:33:13,520
code

4764
03:33:13,520 --> 03:33:16,100
where you can upload php code

4765
03:33:16,100 --> 03:33:18,300
pythoven you're going to write a lot of

4766
03:33:18,300 --> 03:33:20,420
stuff

4767
03:33:20,600 --> 03:33:23,100
we have in addition to Lady of the pack that

4768
03:33:23,100 --> 03:33:25,080
we are identifying ourselves

4769
03:33:25,080 --> 03:33:27,359
we divided our rankings by

4770
03:33:27,359 --> 03:33:28,920
different packs

4771
03:33:28,920 --> 03:33:32,100
and here we have the IP of the one that more than anything

4772
03:33:32,100 --> 03:33:34,080
for when one clicks on it, go virus

4773
03:33:34,080 --> 03:33:35,580
total and can pivot in total virus of

4774
03:33:35,580 --> 03:33:37,200
some way if one wants to know a little

4775
03:33:37,200 --> 03:33:39,779
more of this of this detection we can go

4776
03:33:39,779 --> 03:33:42,060
to the full report link

4777
03:33:42,060 --> 03:33:44,040
and we can have a screenshot of what

4778
03:33:44,040 --> 03:33:47,279
we remove at this time from the review

4779
03:33:47,279 --> 03:33:51,359
the pack it is associated with And if

4780
03:33:51,359 --> 03:33:53,460
we click here below in the part of

4781
03:33:53,460 --> 03:33:55,680
full report we have a list

4782
03:33:55,680 --> 03:33:57,300
of what was done at the level of the

4783
03:33:57,300 --> 03:33:59,220
scan And what interesting files

4784
03:33:59,220 --> 03:34:01,760
we find

4785
03:34:02,540 --> 03:34:05,220
as an initial vision of what the

4786
03:34:05,220 --> 03:34:07,080
platform that we have a lot of information

4787
03:34:07,080 --> 03:34:09,660
that we can get the clean out of

4788
03:34:09,660 --> 03:34:11,120
this of this kind of

4789
03:34:11,120 --> 03:34:13,739
of malicious actions but only

4790
03:34:13,739 --> 03:34:15,120
what about that but what about

4791
03:34:15,120 --> 03:34:16,380
any of the other links that

4792
03:34:16,380 --> 03:34:19,278
we would like to review

4793
03:34:20,040 --> 03:34:22,399
let's change now for the

4794
03:34:22,399 --> 03:34:25,880
return presentation

4795
03:34:34,680 --> 03:34:38,100
then once we have

4796
03:34:38,100 --> 03:34:40,260
this platform that identifies us

4797
03:34:40,260 --> 03:34:42,779
pack we are looking at

4798
03:34:42,779 --> 03:34:45,000
we can learn from some packs

4799
03:34:45,000 --> 03:34:46,979
and to be able to classify the information into

4800
03:34:46,979 --> 03:34:48,180
each of the things we are

4801
03:34:48,180 --> 03:34:51,180
knowing

4802
03:34:51,840 --> 03:34:54,319
We are going to see three particular examples

4803
03:34:54,319 --> 03:34:57,359
pack 1 the first pack that we

4804
03:34:57,359 --> 03:34:59,220
we begin to classify is a very pack

4805
03:34:59,220 --> 03:35:00,899
interesting

4806
03:35:00,899 --> 03:35:02,939
because just as we saw it and

4807
03:35:02,939 --> 03:35:05,819
they practiced at first it is a pack

4808
03:35:05,819 --> 03:35:08,880
which has the final URL of the site very

4809
03:35:08,880 --> 03:35:12,140
particular we can see that it is a domain

4810
03:35:12,140 --> 03:35:16,080
it doesn't matter if the http or htps followed

4811
03:35:16,080 --> 03:35:18,840
that base domain there is a number a number

4812
03:35:18,840 --> 03:35:22,439
quite long that it is always different and

4813
03:35:22,439 --> 03:35:25,080
after that number there is a

4814
03:35:25,080 --> 03:35:28,760
a String or a place of a series of

4815
03:35:28,760 --> 03:35:31,380
characters that all they do is

4816
03:35:31,380 --> 03:35:33,120
simulate

4817
03:35:33,120 --> 03:35:35,160
the original website for the

4818
03:35:35,160 --> 03:35:36,840
person I know is checking the URL of the

4819
03:35:36,840 --> 03:35:38,700
site seems or is confused with what it is

4820
03:35:38,700 --> 03:35:40,800
the original website and this number

4821
03:35:40,800 --> 03:35:42,260
In between

4822
03:35:42,260 --> 03:35:44,700
is very indicative because precisely

4823
03:35:44,700 --> 03:35:46,859
when one wants to do a Take down of

4824
03:35:46,859 --> 03:35:48,899
a site usually puts the final URL

4825
03:35:48,899 --> 03:35:52,200
and since this url always changes

4826
03:35:52,200 --> 03:35:54,180
the people the services they do

4827
03:35:54,180 --> 03:35:56,700
technicians will not be able to lower

4828
03:35:56,700 --> 03:35:57,720
this site because they will not be able to

4829
03:35:57,720 --> 03:36:00,420
find and what is this number is a

4830
03:36:00,420 --> 03:36:03,120
Time fan of the date that is the

4831
03:36:03,120 --> 03:36:05,120
person is falling

4832
03:36:05,120 --> 03:36:08,700
And why is this pack not very interesting?

4833
03:36:08,700 --> 03:36:12,060
because an old pack that already has it I think

4834
03:36:12,060 --> 03:36:13,739
that five years inside the rotations

4835
03:36:13,739 --> 03:36:16,620
of the fixing people that affects the

4836
03:36:16,620 --> 03:36:18,899
Chilean and Peruvian banks have found

4837
03:36:18,899 --> 03:36:20,180
too

4838
03:36:20,180 --> 03:36:22,439
Colombian and Mexican banks that are

4839
03:36:22,439 --> 03:36:24,420
being affected by this kit but not

4840
03:36:24,420 --> 03:36:27,180
They are massive as in Chile and Peru

4841
03:36:27,180 --> 03:36:31,319
it is written in php generate the url

4842
03:36:31,319 --> 03:36:33,479
dynamic with time is geolocated

4843
03:36:33,479 --> 03:36:35,580
Also if you enter from another country

4844
03:36:35,580 --> 03:36:38,399
will block your access to the site

4845
03:36:38,399 --> 03:36:41,460
has a 404 teté redirects Google and

4846
03:36:41,460 --> 03:36:43,500
It also has an administration included

4847
03:36:43,500 --> 03:36:45,600
inside the site with a path

4848
03:36:45,600 --> 03:36:47,420
personalized you will be able to know

4849
03:36:47,420 --> 03:36:49,260
who are the victims who are

4850
03:36:49,260 --> 03:36:52,160
dropping the administrator or

4851
03:36:52,160 --> 03:36:54,960
the owner of this of this domain is going to

4852
03:36:54,960 --> 03:36:56,160
to know who the victims are and

4853
03:36:56,160 --> 03:36:58,560
manage credentials the second

4854
03:36:58,560 --> 03:37:01,620
factor or a lot of other things

4855
03:37:01,620 --> 03:37:04,200
We have been able to download

4856
03:37:04,200 --> 03:37:06,540
several of its versions and they are always

4857
03:37:06,540 --> 03:37:09,180
very similar and there you have the code

4858
03:37:09,180 --> 03:37:12,060
where the filtering is done

4859
03:37:12,060 --> 03:37:14,300
anti bots and anti

4860
03:37:14,300 --> 03:37:16,560
and geolocation where you have to

4861
03:37:16,560 --> 03:37:19,800
have a certain kind of browser

4862
03:37:19,800 --> 03:37:22,200
operating system and country filtering

4863
03:37:22,200 --> 03:37:24,300
to be able to know if you are in the

4864
03:37:24,300 --> 03:37:27,140
in the victim you are not with the victim

4865
03:37:27,140 --> 03:37:29,399
But it is also very interesting

4866
03:37:29,399 --> 03:37:31,739
because this is this fitting kit

4867
03:37:31,739 --> 03:37:33,960
always saves on the victims that

4868
03:37:33,960 --> 03:37:36,300
have a html file inside this

4869
03:37:36,300 --> 03:37:38,160
same directory If you go to

4870
03:37:38,160 --> 03:37:41,100
directory app html you will find

4871
03:37:41,100 --> 03:37:43,920
always the list of victims the bad

4872
03:37:43,920 --> 03:37:47,520
is that the name of the html file is not

4873
03:37:47,520 --> 03:37:50,520
always the same

4874
03:37:50,520 --> 03:37:52,859
but suddenly as we said in a

4875
03:37:52,859 --> 03:37:54,000
principle Generally criminals

4876
03:37:54,000 --> 03:37:55,800
they don't know about computers, they only know

4877
03:37:55,800 --> 03:37:58,140
suddenly they don't have

4878
03:37:58,140 --> 03:38:00,600
implemented director's locks and

4879
03:38:00,600 --> 03:38:02,520
listing and can understand you can have the

4880
03:38:02,520 --> 03:38:04,080
complete list

4881
03:38:04,080 --> 03:38:05,760
of All Those Affected who have saved

4882
03:38:05,760 --> 03:38:08,180
ever

4883
03:38:08,279 --> 03:38:11,540
and more on top thanks to navigation through

4884
03:38:11,540 --> 03:38:13,979
the same browser we can click

4885
03:38:13,979 --> 03:38:15,479
to some files and all the

4886
03:38:15,479 --> 03:38:16,800
information they have and have

4887
03:38:16,800 --> 03:38:20,040
saved the robot the key the second

4888
03:38:20,040 --> 03:38:22,020
notification factor and up to

4889
03:38:22,020 --> 03:38:23,340
credit cards that are saved

4890
03:38:23,340 --> 03:38:25,859
there all this information or information

4891
03:38:25,859 --> 03:38:28,100
also just in case but still

4892
03:38:28,100 --> 03:38:30,779
clicking on these files to

4893
03:38:30,779 --> 03:38:32,760
download them we will have all the

4894
03:38:32,760 --> 03:38:34,620
victim information with that

4895
03:38:34,620 --> 03:38:36,060
we can go a little further and

4896
03:38:36,060 --> 03:38:37,819
tell him

4897
03:38:37,819 --> 03:38:40,500
bank affected institution in this case

4898
03:38:40,500 --> 03:38:43,140
It is not enough just to count down the

4899
03:38:43,140 --> 03:38:46,140
site but also hopefully take

4900
03:38:46,140 --> 03:38:47,640
contact with victims who have fallen

4901
03:38:47,640 --> 03:38:49,859
on this site on this end

4902
03:38:49,859 --> 03:38:52,200
and validate that your credentials are

4903
03:38:52,200 --> 03:38:53,760
correct that there has not been any

4904
03:38:53,760 --> 03:38:55,979
illegal transfer

4905
03:38:55,979 --> 03:38:58,140
or we can do something a little more than

4906
03:38:58,140 --> 03:39:01,399
just take down the site

4907
03:39:01,800 --> 03:39:04,920
Now I also wanted to show you pack 6

4908
03:39:04,920 --> 03:39:08,279
which is quite interesting

4909
03:39:08,279 --> 03:39:11,520
Juan here in Chile we have several places

4910
03:39:11,520 --> 03:39:14,640
that have this particular pattern that is

4911
03:39:14,640 --> 03:39:17,000
a word Generally activation

4912
03:39:17,000 --> 03:39:19,920
inside the URL and then two words

4913
03:39:19,920 --> 03:39:21,720
followed by a hyphen

4914
03:39:21,720 --> 03:39:24,180
here on the right there are many of the

4915
03:39:24,180 --> 03:39:27,060
sites that have that kind of pattern

4916
03:39:27,060 --> 03:39:29,340
and when that pattern is repeated it tells us ok

4917
03:39:29,340 --> 03:39:33,420
there is something strange or something that is repeated

4918
03:39:33,420 --> 03:39:34,859
and we saw the same in the example

4919
03:39:34,859 --> 03:39:38,040
previous where is the architecture

4920
03:39:38,040 --> 03:39:40,859
more complex of sites we have this

4921
03:39:40,859 --> 03:39:42,359
link that is in between that is part of

4922
03:39:42,359 --> 03:39:45,180
this pack 006

4923
03:39:45,180 --> 03:39:48,359
and what is this part is a catwalk is

4924
03:39:48,359 --> 03:39:49,979
a gateway to filter access to the

4925
03:39:49,979 --> 03:39:52,020
fisching in more complex architecture

4926
03:39:52,020 --> 03:39:55,080
you can know you can have this

4927
03:39:55,080 --> 03:39:56,939
type of catwalks to say Ok not me

4928
03:39:56,939 --> 03:39:58,200
just filter the

4929
03:39:58,200 --> 03:40:00,600
fishing from the final site but i can

4930
03:40:00,600 --> 03:40:02,520
filter before and have gateways for

4931
03:40:02,520 --> 03:40:05,040
redirect me to the people I want

4932
03:40:05,040 --> 03:40:07,620
pass and to the other that is not also there

4933
03:40:07,620 --> 03:40:10,560
written in pachepe for the same details

4934
03:40:10,560 --> 03:40:13,800
above contains geolocations and

4935
03:40:13,800 --> 03:40:15,439
dumbbell lock

4936
03:40:15,439 --> 03:40:19,020
redirect urls and administration

4937
03:40:19,020 --> 03:40:21,560
and the interesting thing is that

4938
03:40:21,560 --> 03:40:24,120
well we also have access to

4939
03:40:24,120 --> 03:40:26,460
code of this pack 006 and we can

4940
03:40:26,460 --> 03:40:29,040
analyze it a little more and we know that

4941
03:40:29,040 --> 03:40:31,200
has certain vulnerabilities

4942
03:40:31,200 --> 03:40:33,060
but one of the interesting things is

4943
03:40:33,060 --> 03:40:35,700
that when one tries to enter the panel

4944
03:40:35,700 --> 03:40:38,040
administration appears with this

4945
03:40:38,040 --> 03:40:39,840
screen that is a screen that simulates

4946
03:40:39,840 --> 03:40:42,479
be from Google ads

4947
03:40:42,479 --> 03:40:44,460
but the most entertaining for me

4948
03:40:44,460 --> 03:40:46,080
example is that they have not even been given

4949
03:40:46,080 --> 03:40:48,359
the work of changing the year continues

4950
03:40:48,359 --> 03:40:50,100
being 2014 for the people of

4951
03:40:50,100 --> 03:40:52,500
Google management Then with

4952
03:40:52,500 --> 03:40:55,200
that we can already know that this is a one

4953
03:40:55,200 --> 03:40:57,660
fake admin site that doesn't

4954
03:40:57,660 --> 03:40:59,819
has nothing to do with Google Apps What if

4955
03:40:59,819 --> 03:41:01,560
We know the password we can

4956
03:41:01,560 --> 03:41:03,540
arrive and enter

4957
03:41:03,540 --> 03:41:05,460
we can come in and know which ones

4958
03:41:05,460 --> 03:41:07,439
are the redirect sites What is the

4959
03:41:07,439 --> 03:41:09,720
country affected in this case Chile by the

4960
03:41:09,720 --> 03:41:12,000
cl code

4961
03:41:12,000 --> 03:41:14,340
we have the URL of the filing site

4962
03:41:14,340 --> 03:41:17,340
spam url we have the spam url is

4963
03:41:17,340 --> 03:41:19,500
for when it detects that a Bot or another

4964
03:41:19,500 --> 03:41:22,439
country to which it sends them

4965
03:41:22,439 --> 03:41:25,979
and the ips which is a list of ips which are

4966
03:41:25,979 --> 03:41:27,779
of the people who are doing blocked

4967
03:41:27,779 --> 03:41:29,520
and you are doing filtering on this

4968
03:41:29,520 --> 03:41:32,600
case but the big question below

4969
03:41:32,600 --> 03:41:36,239
What happens if I don't know the key if I don't

4970
03:41:36,239 --> 03:41:37,979
I know the password to enter this this

4971
03:41:37,979 --> 03:41:40,519
administration panel

4972
03:41:40,620 --> 03:41:43,260
and there comes the studio kit

4973
03:41:43,260 --> 03:41:45,239
previous fishing as we have the code

4974
03:41:45,239 --> 03:41:47,340
we can know what is the behavior

4975
03:41:47,340 --> 03:41:49,439
generic and

4976
03:41:49,439 --> 03:41:52,020
We see that if we search in the domain

4977
03:41:52,020 --> 03:41:55,100
from Slash Data Slash PJ point config

4978
03:41:55,100 --> 03:41:58,859
we have the configuration file

4979
03:41:58,859 --> 03:42:00,660
the bad thing is that the files

4980
03:42:00,660 --> 03:42:02,819
configuration is always with data

4981
03:42:02,819 --> 03:42:05,300
encrypted then

4982
03:42:05,300 --> 03:42:08,160
again as we have the pack and we can

4983
03:42:08,160 --> 03:42:10,620
studying it we can generate a Script of

4984
03:42:10,620 --> 03:42:11,960
decryption of this type of

4985
03:42:11,960 --> 03:42:15,359
configurations And we have Exactly what

4986
03:42:15,359 --> 03:42:16,920
It is the same as what appeared on the page

4987
03:42:16,920 --> 03:42:18,420
web But we can have it directly

4988
03:42:18,420 --> 03:42:21,060
without knowing the key without entering the

4989
03:42:21,060 --> 03:42:23,939
website and without leaving within the blogs

4990
03:42:23,939 --> 03:42:25,140
of this administration that we

4991
03:42:25,140 --> 03:42:27,300
we entered downloaded the file

4992
03:42:27,300 --> 03:42:28,920
We just figured it out and that's it

4993
03:42:28,920 --> 03:42:29,939
we have all the information

4994
03:42:29,939 --> 03:42:31,859
we need

4995
03:42:31,859 --> 03:42:33,319
further

4996
03:42:33,319 --> 03:42:35,399
the same can be done Not only for

4997
03:42:35,399 --> 03:42:37,080
download the information and have a

4998
03:42:37,080 --> 03:42:38,520
monitoring but we could also

4999
03:42:38,520 --> 03:42:40,800
use this information to change the

5000
03:42:40,800 --> 03:42:43,340
files directly has a failure of

5001
03:42:43,340 --> 03:42:45,420


5002
03:42:45,420 --> 03:42:48,120


5003
03:42:48,120 --> 03:42:51,560


5004
