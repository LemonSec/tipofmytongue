always expected in all events

122
00:14:14,649 --> 00:14:16,899
because the meeting has always been a

123
00:14:16,899 --> 00:14:19,809
Colombian showcase for people

124
00:14:19,809 --> 00:14:22,019

131
00:14:37,619 --> 00:14:40,360
Has anyone had this topic for a long time?

132
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:42,730
time the truth did not come to manizales

133
00:14:42,730 --> 00:14:45,819
many several years ago tests that dean

134
00:14:45,819 --> 00:14:49,139
is one of the 25 after in 2009

135
00:14:49,139 --> 00:14:52,600

136
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:55,179
manizales has grown a lot the movement in

137
00:14:55,179 --> 00:14:57,520
his second decision too

138
00:14:57,520 --> 00:15:02,790

139
00:15:03,510 --> 00:15:05,760
I am very happy because it feels like

140
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:09,450
there is let's say that more participation

141
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:11,720
It is important to have more awareness

142
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:13,850
as to

143
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:18,620
safe to be safe and

144
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:22,850
to make sure

145
00:15:23,450 --> 00:15:26,940

00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:33,570
a chat called rap sporting and

149
00:15:33,570 --> 00:15:35,460
basically we are going to find the

150
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:38,550
servers from bad hackers and what

151
00:15:38,550 --> 00:15:39,690
let's find where they are at

152
00:15:39,690 --> 00:15:41,870
internet and sometimes we can

153
00:15:41,870 --> 00:15:44,580
disable and well is what comes

154
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:46,830

00:15:52,209 --> 00:15:54,879
a reputation the community already has

158
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:58,319
many years my name is

159
00:15:58,319 --> 00:16:01,959
Max I come from Peru but currently lives

160
00:16:01,959 --> 00:16:05,160
in buenos aires this conference of

161
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:07,720
2015 of my fourth time I'm coming

162
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:09,790
so the truth is that I have a love

163
00:16:09,790 --> 00:16:11,949
especially for the

164
00:16:11,949 --> 00:16:13,809
knowledge that is shared my talk

165
00:16:13,809 --> 00:16:15,490
specifically talk about issues of

166
00:16:15,490 --> 00:16:17,559
exploitation of vulnerabilities in wii

167
00:16:17,559 --> 00:16:21,399
in windows on how were all found

168
00:16:21,399 --> 00:16:23,709
those vulnerabilities without de wilde and

169
00:16:23,709 --> 00:16:27,939
like us a cork I was able to perform

170
00:16:27,939 --> 00:16:30,490
the exploits and tell a little what is the

171
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:32,319
impact of these exploits and how

172
00:16:32,319 --> 00:16:34,149
work so that people can

173
00:16:34,149 --> 00:16:37,329
understand like this

174
00:16:37,329 --> 00:16:39,309
may be vulnerable not only

175
00:16:39,309 --> 00:16:41,769
users but also companies and what

176
00:16:41,769 --> 00:16:44,619
measures can be taken to avoid falling into

177
00:16:44,619 --> 00:16:47,800
these things that maybe they can bring

00:19:39,479 --> 00:19:41,950
for the love they have expressed to us

245
00:19:41,950 --> 00:19:45,020
you on all social networks

246
00:19:45,020 --> 00:19:49,490
this presentation is more than all one and

247
00:19:49,490 --> 00:19:51,740
are the instructions basically for

248
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:53,830
that they learn to enjoy the event

249
00:19:53,830 --> 00:19:55,520
mainly because I know that many

250
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,500
of you arrived today for

251
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:59,300
recommendation from a friend or relative

252
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:02,150
or colleague who was yesterday and told them

253
00:20:02,150 --> 00:20:03,740
they depend on this event that is very

254
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:06,020
well this one arrives or not and they don't know much

255
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:08,510
of what is being seen to cassiers

256
00:20:08,510 --> 00:20:11,150
so the institutions for that

257
00:20:11,150 --> 00:20:13,490
we are tired most events

258
00:20:13,490 --> 00:20:16,870
online true but

259
00:20:16,870 --> 00:20:20,350
this is our last one with 100% online

260
00:20:20,350 --> 00:20:22,090
because we are going to the next edition

261
00:20:22,090 --> 00:20:24,090
have face-to-face

262
00:20:24,090 --> 00:20:27,010
possibly in the city of manizales

263
00:20:27,010 --> 00:20:29,110
in a hybrid format what does it mean

264
00:20:29,110 --> 00:20:31,840
although there is a possibility that

265
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:33,520
let's charge input into the electro

266
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:35,590
in person we are going to stream

267
00:20:35,590 --> 00:20:39,640
keep 100% online and free this

268
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:41,410
Well, because we have seen that you have

269
00:20:41,410 --> 00:20:43,810
highly appreciated all the efforts

270
00:20:43,810 --> 00:20:46,360
it is being done by when

271
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:48,250
we are doing these transmissions and

272
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:50,050
because we know that there are people who know

273
00:20:50,050 --> 00:20:52,960
connects from cuba to venezuela

274
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:55,240
other countries that possibly if not

275
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:57,220
outside because we broadcast live on

276
00:20:57,220 --> 00:20:59,380
internet for free could not

277
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:01,630
access this content

278
00:21:01,630 --> 00:21:04,960
as I am yesterday for the speakers and

279
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,910
for the organizers and for everyone in

280
00:21:06,910 --> 00:21:08,980
general it is important that they make us

281
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:12,250
feel the love on social networks now

282
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:14,260
we have seen how effective it is

283
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:16,660
this and we have seen how the same

284
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:17,910
explain

285
00:21:17,910 --> 00:21:21,340
respond to posts thank you

286
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:24,400

287
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,140
very important that we do it with him

288
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:28,570
hashtag dragon hardcore why yes

289
00:21:28,570 --> 00:21:30,910
you do not know or did not find out the

290
00:21:30,910 --> 00:21:32,740
yesterday we managed to be a trend

291
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:34,420
only in the city where we are

292
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:36,520
allowing but at the national level in the

293
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:39,280
section for you on twitter and this

294
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:41,560
It was only possible thanks to everyone

295
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:44,140
support that you gave us apart from

296
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:46,240
that this morning we woke up with that

297
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,650
put and cool that is a company

298
00:21:47,650 --> 00:21:50,080
specialized in all that networking issue

299
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:52,750
social because he began to follow in the

300
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:55,420
trending topic the drawn hardcore and we

301
00:21:55,420 --> 00:21:56,800
releases a series of statistics

302
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:59,050
interesting here for example we see the

303
00:21:59,050 --> 00:22:02,130
people who have been participating more

304
00:22:02,130 --> 00:22:04,730
from yesterday to today

305
00:22:04,730 --> 00:22:07,940
Let's hope that this top is getting more and more

306
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:11,670
varied and more and more people appear

307
00:22:11,670 --> 00:22:13,530
for this we have a kit

308
00:22:13,530 --> 00:22:17,160
survival or press actually the

309
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:20,250
first we have is the number 2 is

310
00:22:20,250 --> 00:22:22,470
for the possibility to download more or

311
00:22:22,470 --> 00:22:24,780
less than 800 megabytes that has videos

312
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:28,410
Let's say a lot of content and the number

313
00:22:28,410 --> 00:22:31,110
2 which is the same as number 1 but

314
00:22:31,110 --> 00:22:32,730
without the videos then they have

315
00:22:32,730 --> 00:22:34,290
templates by paul for you

316
00:22:34,290 --> 00:22:35,910
can make their own posts

317
00:22:35,910 --> 00:22:38,520
they have the talks the summaries

318
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:39,960
speakers the social networks of the

319
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:41,640
you explain well they have everything

320
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:43,890
they need so they can continue

321
00:22:43,890 --> 00:22:45,390
supporting and sending love

322
00:22:45,390 --> 00:22:47,630
speakers from here

323
00:22:47,630 --> 00:22:50,120
we also saw that many creative people

324
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:53,120
it occurred to him to take memes from the event and

325
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:55,790
which we quite liked there are some very

326
00:22:55,790 --> 00:22:58,340
interesting those that we are going to

327
00:22:58,340 --> 00:23:00,940
laugh a lot

328
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:03,380
some came out related to the

329
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:05,270
occasional talks by some of the speakers

330
00:23:05,270 --> 00:23:09,200
others more generic then the truth

331
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,880
we achieved a lot they can be doing

332
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:14,510
Some of us are going to ask for contests

333
00:23:14,510 --> 00:23:16,760
better of better said without if they make you laugh

334
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:18,920
to the three spades because we have a channel

335
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:22,100
internally and that they themselves choose which

336
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:24,680
It is the best meme to date there are very

337
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:26,290
good ones

338
00:23:26,290 --> 00:23:29,830
So don't stop, don't stop sending your

339
00:23:29,830 --> 00:23:31,440
publications

340
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:34,990
we have the space in general we are

341
00:23:34,990 --> 00:23:36,970
broadcasting on multiple channels

342
00:23:36,970 --> 00:23:39,250
mainly on youtube but also

343
00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:41,950
we are on facebook on twitter and on

344
00:23:41,950 --> 00:23:44,260
twitch then so we don't know

345
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:46,000
go back to where they were

346
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,470
Given the questions, we are going to have

347
00:23:47,470 --> 00:23:49,180

351
00:23:56,380 --> 00:23:58,150
we transmit to the speaker so that he can

352
00:23:58,150 --> 00:24:00,220
go on screen we also have a

353

381
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:11,620

00:27:27,170 --> 00:27:28,910
decision it is incredible that they have already

438
00:27:28,910 --> 00:27:31,160
Ten years have passed since the first dragon

439
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:34,040
hardcore and well let's try

440
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:36,710
do it as it should be a celebration of

441
00:27:36,710 --> 00:27:38,890
accounts with the public

442
00:27:38,890 --> 00:27:42,700

443
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:44,590
I come to talk about the same thing

444
00:27:44,590 --> 00:27:46,930
vary as always and that's why I put it

445
00:27:46,930 --> 00:27:48,910
I'm going to give a talk at the dragon

446
00:27:48,910 --> 00:27:50,890
hardcore if I'm going to talk about expertise

447
00:27:50,890 --> 00:27:52,390
forensic computer I'm going to talk about

448
00:27:52,390 --> 00:27:54,790
incident response is one is two

449
00:27:54,790 --> 00:27:57,190
cases I'm going to go a little fast because already

450
00:27:57,190 --> 00:27:59,200
we have eaten ten minutes and it says

451
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:02,680
I have for a little while you already know me

452
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:04,630
lorenzo martinez the director of

453
00:28:04,630 --> 00:28:08,200

454
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:09,520
you have my email for whatever you want

455
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:13,000
Lorenza steals dotcom security I don't use

456
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,130
things in between for me to write

457
00:28:15,130 --> 00:28:17,050
you write there and period

458
00:28:17,050 --> 00:28:19,770
and my twitter wait for what you want

459
00:28:19,770 --> 00:28:22,660
display mer as always the cases that

460
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:24,520
I am going to expose they are true they are things

461
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:26,530
that have happened to me that have happened to

462
00:28:26,530 --> 00:28:27,879
me or the team

463
00:28:27,879 --> 00:28:29,469
surely we have done here in

464
00:28:29,469 --> 00:28:31,749
in any case, of course,

465
00:28:31,749 --> 00:28:33,190
hidden to the original idea of ​​fact

466
00:28:33,190 --> 00:28:34,959
Every time I give this change talk

467
00:28:34,959 --> 00:28:39,219
certain data, let's say the content, that is

468
00:28:39,219 --> 00:28:41,259
from the point of view of professions

469
00:28:41,259 --> 00:28:43,509
things etcetera to make it a little more

470
00:28:43,509 --> 00:28:45,999
complicated and the only exposure

471
00:28:45,999 --> 00:28:48,279
purpose it has is academic

472
00:28:48,279 --> 00:28:50,739
to say what it is about here is

473
00:28:50,739 --> 00:28:54,039
count I did this like this and that's how it came out and

474
00:28:54,039 --> 00:28:56,109
we got to this content to this to this

475
00:28:56,109 --> 00:28:58,029
result doing this like this

476
00:28:58,029 --> 00:29:00,760
that's the goal nothing more

477
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:02,440
from the first case as I say

478
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:05,710
there are two is one of pure expertise

479
00:29:05,710 --> 00:29:10,260
pure computer forensics in this case is

480
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:12,720
the one you see because as they are from

481
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:15,510
important forensic artifacts

482
00:29:15,510 --> 00:29:17,310
hard drive file system

483
00:29:17,310 --> 00:29:21,120
you are going to see what I mean or how not

484
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:23,100
make an expert opinion

485
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:25,560
contrary to what he did now you are going to see a

486
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:28,770
pretty good botch basically is

487
00:29:28,770 --> 00:29:30,720
I put in background of the case as if

488
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:33,510
It is about a person who was my

489
00:29:33,510 --> 00:29:35,910
client was a person who worked in

490
00:29:35,910 --> 00:29:38,940
a company and was fired because while

491
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:41,460
low for kobe for example it could be

492
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:42,870
for other things but let's put for

493
00:29:42,870 --> 00:29:44,440
kobe

494
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:47,670
Of course, to all this, someone who is going to

495
00:29:47,670 --> 00:29:50,110
start doing the job you did

496
00:29:50,110 --> 00:29:53,370
this person this was a lawyer

497
00:29:53,370 --> 00:29:56,340
he's going to get down to it and he's in

498
00:29:56,340 --> 00:29:59,610
the corporate computer according to the

499
00:29:59,610 --> 00:30:03,350
company has been used

500
00:30:03,350 --> 00:30:06,230
and doing personal work have been

501
00:30:06,230 --> 00:30:08,240
found information according to the

502
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:11,150
company in which good thing is

503
00:30:11,150 --> 00:30:12,520
person

504
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:14,960
Let's say that the in would run in a

505
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:17,140
series of personal works and has

506
00:30:17,140 --> 00:30:20,570
billed elsewhere

507
00:30:20,570 --> 00:30:23,360
the client tells me man me years ago

508
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:24,980
yes it is true that he did something else

509
00:30:24,980 --> 00:30:28,460
thing but the information that they are

510
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:30,940
raising this company

511
00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:33,860
I was not on the computer at the

512
00:30:33,860 --> 00:30:36,440
corporate computer that I used

513
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:38,539
but it was on a hard drive of mine

514
00:30:38,539 --> 00:30:40,610
personal that was in the drawer of my

515
00:30:40,610 --> 00:30:43,009
table then of course if the company has

516
00:30:43,009 --> 00:30:45,019
accessed the drawer seen a hard drive

517
00:30:45,019 --> 00:30:47,360
has connected it has looked inside and has

518
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:49,639
Having said what is here, well, if he

519
00:30:49,639 --> 00:30:51,590
hard drive is personal you can't

520
00:30:51,590 --> 00:30:56,210
do that and have filed to dismiss

521
00:30:56,210 --> 00:30:58,730
to this person by paying zero euros without

522
00:30:58,730 --> 00:31:02,090
compensation and an expert report

523
00:31:02,090 --> 00:31:03,440
expert report made by the other

524
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:04,800
part

525
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:08,190
prove the existence of a series

526
00:31:08,190 --> 00:31:10,980
of files on the corporate computer

527
00:31:10,980 --> 00:31:14,910
and he says I made the expert report that they have

528
00:31:14,910 --> 00:31:17,460
been created or processed since that

529
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:21,680
computer is based on what

530
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:26,160
extract, analyze and conclude that expert

531
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:28,380
he says he has enough information

532
00:31:28,380 --> 00:31:30,780
to conclude that the information that

533
00:31:30,780 --> 00:31:32,640
I was on the corporate computer of

534
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:34,950
this company from this assigned company

535
00:31:34,950 --> 00:31:39,060
to this person was made by in that

536
00:31:39,060 --> 00:31:41,850
computer since it was assigned to this

537
00:31:41,850 --> 00:31:44,490
worker that my client asks me

538
00:31:44,490 --> 00:31:46,830
He tells me look, read the expert report of

539
00:31:46,830 --> 00:31:49,299
adverse the opposite

540
00:31:49,299 --> 00:31:51,070
look to see

541
00:31:51,070 --> 00:31:52,389
what evidence do you have to acquire

542
00:31:52,389 --> 00:31:56,110
inside what there is and analyze it and

543
00:31:56,110 --> 00:31:58,450
look at it because I am sure that

544
00:31:58,450 --> 00:32:00,220
that was not there because I know what

545
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:03,230
what was there and what was not

546
00:32:03,230 --> 00:32:04,760
and on the other hand of course you have to

547
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:07,070
identify whether the evidence that has

548
00:32:07,070 --> 00:32:08,929
presented the opposites are

549
00:32:08,929 --> 00:32:11,870
compatible with what my

550
00:32:11,870 --> 00:32:13,820
clients to isolate the expertise of the

551
00:32:13,820 --> 00:32:16,160
contrary and the evidences extracted and

552
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:18,140
analyzed are compatible with what

553
00:32:18,140 --> 00:32:20,310
my client is saying

554
00:32:20,310 --> 00:32:22,680
ok then the first thing i do is

555
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:26,280
read me the expert report of the opponent

556
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:29,220
I see that very formally they have

557
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:31,620
run a notary in spain for example

558
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:33,660
It is not like in Colombia in which what

559
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:36,390
the expert says mass and points to is so

560
00:32:36,390 --> 00:32:39,660
And it's over, but in Spain an expert

561
00:32:39,660 --> 00:32:42,090
computer from or has been brought by

562
00:32:42,090 --> 00:32:45,539
one party does not have to public

563
00:32:45,539 --> 00:32:48,149
in this case they are taken to a notary and the

564
00:32:48,149 --> 00:32:51,450
notary let all a series of

565
00:32:51,450 --> 00:32:53,609
facts carried out by the expert

566
00:32:53,609 --> 00:32:55,320
does the expert and what does he say that it is being

567
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:57,090
the notary says so in his notarial deed and

568
00:32:57,090 --> 00:33:01,109
the expert in his report says that since

569
00:33:01,109 --> 00:33:03,119
They tell you that there was a series of files

570
00:33:03,119 --> 00:33:05,070
who were on the computer today

571
00:33:05,070 --> 00:33:07,529
he arrives and takes out two hard drives that he has

572
00:33:07,529 --> 00:33:10,409
in a bag and takes two hard drives

573
00:33:10,409 --> 00:33:14,239
in scoring in the new ones I know very well

574
00:33:14,239 --> 00:33:17,879
the expert directly starts the

575
00:33:17,879 --> 00:33:22,409
that person's computer plugs one in

576
00:33:22,409 --> 00:33:24,720
of those hard drives, formatting them is

577
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:27,629
there also connect the other hard drive

578
00:33:27,629 --> 00:33:31,639
also format it from that windows

579
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:37,379
and they give you access with the user of this

580
00:33:37,379 --> 00:33:39,779
person who says they had the

581
00:33:39,779 --> 00:33:42,169
user's password was in a

582
00:33:42,169 --> 00:33:45,059
post-it or on a sheet and I don't know if below

583
00:33:45,059 --> 00:33:46,950
keyboard in a drawer behind the

584
00:33:46,950 --> 00:33:48,809
monitor or glued to the monitor or not if in

585
00:33:48,809 --> 00:33:51,220
somewhere had the password

586
00:33:51,220 --> 00:33:53,020
they connect with a user like i should

587
00:33:53,020 --> 00:33:57,220
format those hard drives and the expert

588
00:33:57,220 --> 00:33:59,080
arrives and looks for certain files and

589
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:01,030
drags them right into one of those

590
00:34:01,030 --> 00:34:03,220
hard drives as some were in a

591
00:34:03,220 --> 00:34:04,690
site the ones the company tells you no

592
00:34:04,690 --> 00:34:06,280
they were at the desk others were

593
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:08,349
I don't know where others were in another

594
00:34:08,349 --> 00:34:11,349
location drags them a disc and

595
00:34:11,349 --> 00:34:13,480
then how to repeat that again because it was

596
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:16,719
a little bit of a pain in the ass what it does is

597
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:18,879
open one of those disks and from there

598
00:34:18,879 --> 00:34:21,099
disk drags everything to the other copy

599
00:34:21,099 --> 00:34:23,469
hit the other

600
00:34:23,469 --> 00:34:26,109
go crowned with evidence don't go

601
00:34:26,109 --> 00:34:27,580
acquisition of evidence that can

602
00:34:27,580 --> 00:34:29,349
make my father who is not an expert

603
00:34:29,349 --> 00:34:31,270
computer forensic or copied

604
00:34:31,270 --> 00:34:34,960
directly with the clear windows and

605
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:36,790
then it arrives disconnects the two disks

606
00:34:36,790 --> 00:34:38,469
hard and tells the notary good to see

607
00:34:38,469 --> 00:34:39,820
that I put them here back come one

608
00:34:39,820 --> 00:34:41,440
for you not for me any is for

609
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:43,840
Well, it is after this that the notary grabs

610
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:46,119
one presents it signs it with a seal

611
00:34:46,119 --> 00:34:49,300
from the notary all very well and the expert

612
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:51,340
he takes another record home a day

613
00:34:51,340 --> 00:34:54,040
Following this, the computer

614
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:57,580
format directly as they tell me and

615
00:34:57,580 --> 00:34:59,170
it is assigned by worker because there was

616
00:34:59,170 --> 00:35:01,240
to continue working with the access that

617
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:02,710
the corporate information that had the

618
00:35:02,710 --> 00:35:04,810
important gold because if you format it and

619
00:35:04,810 --> 00:35:06,970
they do not pay attention I do not know there is something a little

620
00:35:06,970 --> 00:35:09,940
strange but now total that the expert

621
00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:12,070
league and with the order with the hard disk

622
00:35:12,070 --> 00:35:14,950
that he has that he has taken him back to

623
00:35:14,950 --> 00:35:17,080
copy to your computer this got it out in

624
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:19,119
based on various screenshots in

625
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:21,220
which efe it is seen that the date is at

626
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:22,570
day after going to do the

627
00:35:22,570 --> 00:35:25,420
acquisition and based on that

628
00:35:25,420 --> 00:35:28,089
and its files copied from windows

629
00:35:28,089 --> 00:35:29,549
obviously

630
00:35:29,549 --> 00:35:32,819
analyzes and concludes that indeed

631
00:35:32,819 --> 00:35:35,230
that information has been created and or

632
00:35:35,230 --> 00:35:37,589
processed from this computer

633
00:35:37,589 --> 00:35:40,059
amazing for any connoisseur who is

634
00:35:40,059 --> 00:35:42,430
seeing this except the expert that

635
00:35:42,430 --> 00:35:45,180
did this job look what an aberration

636
00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:48,040
come to this walesa because simply

637
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:52,299
based on analyzing the files and now and

638
00:35:52,299 --> 00:35:53,950
have been made on that computer have not

639
00:35:53,950 --> 00:35:56,109
could be copied put there and

640
00:35:56,109 --> 00:35:57,510
directly

641
00:35:57,510 --> 00:36:00,520
to be at I do not deny existence but

642
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:02,559
man from there to use creation and

643
00:36:02,559 --> 00:36:06,280
treatment there is a difference but

644
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:08,470
to all this the notary when he goes there

645
00:36:08,470 --> 00:36:11,050
it was to put it at 12 in the morning

646
00:36:11,050 --> 00:36:14,140
when he went to draw up the minutes of the

647
00:36:14,140 --> 00:36:16,330
notary records hello being

648
00:36:16,330 --> 00:36:18,040
12 in the morning I start to see what

649
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:20,670
this time ago

650
00:36:21,950 --> 00:36:23,780
what do I do I'm going to make one

651
00:36:23,780 --> 00:36:25,339
acquisition of these evidences I have the

652
00:36:25,339 --> 00:36:27,079
report of the other uncle in which I become

653
00:36:27,079 --> 00:36:29,450
crosses when I read it and on the other hand

654
00:36:29,450 --> 00:36:31,400
I see what I can do

655
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:36,170
then the judge allows me to go to the

656
00:36:36,170 --> 00:36:39,050
company and the only thing I can and they let me

657
00:36:39,050 --> 00:36:40,550
do is a visual inspection of the

658
00:36:40,550 --> 00:36:42,829
computer I go with the client that

659
00:36:42,829 --> 00:36:44,960
distinctively this may be my

660
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:48,020
computer or not I don't know you can also

661
00:36:48,020 --> 00:36:49,130
say what you want is also true

662
00:36:49,130 --> 00:36:51,800
but the company tells me that this is the

663
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:54,560
computer lead me to all this there was a

664
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:57,410
attorney for the other party my client is

665
00:36:57,410 --> 00:37:00,770
a computer scientist from the company who

666
00:37:00,770 --> 00:37:02,930
Lets see what's there and I what I do

667
00:37:02,930 --> 00:37:05,300
It's the least I can do because

668
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:06,859
Obviously I can't overdo it

669
00:37:06,859 --> 00:37:09,140
what i do booted the computer up and

670
00:37:09,140 --> 00:37:10,980
i think i can do it

671
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:13,830
connected a flash drive to the machine in the

672
00:37:13,830 --> 00:37:15,570
which one told the computer scientist look at this

673
00:37:15,570 --> 00:37:17,340
It only has one tool called

674
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:20,310
fck worth mind that is a tool

675
00:37:20,310 --> 00:37:23,760
forensic that allows you without access to the

676
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:26,430
files worth without manually accessing

677
00:37:26,430 --> 00:37:29,160
each thing allows me to see how a

678
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:30,720
file system inside

679
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:32,790
playing her master fighter iv is

680
00:37:32,790 --> 00:37:35,940
say an internal forensic artifact of a

681
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:38,970
own ntfs file system

682
00:37:38,970 --> 00:37:42,480
sheep with this what interests me is

683
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:45,090
see the date of creation of the emt

684
00:37:45,090 --> 00:37:47,040
because because you are going to tell me the date of

685
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:49,770
formatting those drives yes

686
00:37:49,770 --> 00:37:51,750
indeed it coincides that they had been

687
00:37:51,750 --> 00:37:53,550
formatted the day after

688
00:37:53,550 --> 00:37:58,099
the expert would have gone with him no such

689
00:37:58,099 --> 00:37:59,809
to all this I say okay well this is it

690
00:37:59,809 --> 00:38:02,769
that i have seen initially

691
00:38:03,490 --> 00:38:06,640
one of the things that they tell me and tell me

692
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:09,820
my client is that there in the files

693
00:38:09,820 --> 00:38:12,430
that appear on that disk that I copied is

694
00:38:12,430 --> 00:38:16,090
this expert there are files that were

695
00:38:16,090 --> 00:38:19,420
were created in years long before

696
00:38:19,420 --> 00:38:22,060
when this pc existed, that is, it is impossible

697
00:38:22,060 --> 00:38:25,510
that I have done or tried or otherwise

698
00:38:25,510 --> 00:38:28,060
least created that file with this

699
00:38:28,060 --> 00:38:30,520
computer because the hardware did not exist

700
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:32,710
of this computer when that was made

701
00:38:32,710 --> 00:38:36,160
file therefore what I do is

702
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:38,290
also look in the profile of the

703
00:38:38,290 --> 00:38:40,480
windows device manager

704
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:43,150
the hardware that hardware is there and I see that

705
00:38:43,150 --> 00:38:47,110
It is an intel i5 of tenth I invented it

706
00:38:47,110 --> 00:38:49,840
generation and a graphics card in the

707
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:51,490
to be

708
00:38:51,490 --> 00:38:53,920
whatever model it is then what do I do next

709
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:56,440
give me a look at the date of that and based

710
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:58,119
to creation date from hardware

711
00:38:58,119 --> 00:39:00,070
I can say no on that computer I don't know

712
00:39:00,070 --> 00:39:02,619
did because this processor is from this

713
00:39:02,619 --> 00:39:05,230
year and these files were created in

714
00:39:05,230 --> 00:39:06,910
a much earlier date therefore this

715
00:39:06,910 --> 00:39:08,770
What is this person saying here?

716
00:39:08,770 --> 00:39:10,980
false worth of

717
00:39:10,980 --> 00:39:13,180
a forensic image of the drive

718
00:39:13,180 --> 00:39:15,130
computer there is no expert in his day

719
00:39:15,130 --> 00:39:16,930
I copy the files, bloated, I don't know

720
00:39:16,930 --> 00:39:19,540
it occurred to make a forensic image of the

721
00:39:19,540 --> 00:39:21,790
disc save it before a notary as

722
00:39:21,790 --> 00:39:23,440
I would correspond as any expert

723
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:26,350
would normally occur to him to say

724
00:39:26,350 --> 00:39:28,810
each in two things one in expert did not have

725
00:39:28,810 --> 00:39:32,610
no [ __ ] idea option 1 or the expert and it was

726
00:39:32,610 --> 00:39:34,930
required to simply make copy

727
00:39:34,930 --> 00:39:37,840
of files and perhaps proposed to the

728
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:40,570
better not to make a picture and leave one

729
00:39:40,570 --> 00:39:42,460
real image made but on record

730
00:39:42,460 --> 00:39:44,410
notary was not there and maybe the other

731
00:39:44,410 --> 00:39:45,760
part said it's not going to make this

732
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:48,040
way me if they ask me so

733
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:49,450
I will do but left a written record

734
00:39:49,450 --> 00:39:52,000
that I recommend doing it from another

735
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,820
So why do I make an image at

736
00:39:54,820 --> 00:39:57,100
disk with the files entrusted by the

737
00:39:57,100 --> 00:40:00,430
another expert to plug it in are many and

738
00:40:00,430 --> 00:40:02,650
copy them to an image as God intended

739
00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:04,750
a cold image and on that image

740
00:40:04,750 --> 00:40:08,700
work to all this believe

741
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:11,250
a performance certificate mine of course

742
00:40:11,250 --> 00:40:12,780
there was a notary at that time what

743
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:15,000
I did was write a document that

744
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:18,300
compel all witnesses to the party

745
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:20,760
contrary and mine and I all

746
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:22,890
we sign that act, they are written with

747
00:40:22,890 --> 00:40:24,390
what happens if someone has to

748
00:40:24,390 --> 00:40:25,770
make a statement that I have

749
00:40:25,770 --> 00:40:28,020
done something wrong put it there why

750
00:40:28,020 --> 00:40:29,820
I do this to heal myself in health if I

751
00:40:29,820 --> 00:40:30,829
later

752
00:40:30,829 --> 00:40:33,000
I have a problem because the other party

753
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,410
says that you exceeded the firm I know

754
00:40:34,410 --> 00:40:36,210
what and why you did not put this by

755
00:40:36,210 --> 00:40:38,310
video course I wrote and everyone

756
00:40:38,310 --> 00:40:40,349
I agreed that what I had

757
00:40:40,349 --> 00:40:41,940
done was the bare minimum

758
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:43,650
they agreed to allow me to do

759
00:40:43,650 --> 00:40:45,660
this that no one was opposed to what I

760
00:40:45,660 --> 00:40:47,579
did with this saved me that no one

761
00:40:47,579 --> 00:40:49,589
I can blame like everyone else

762
00:40:49,589 --> 00:40:52,050
we sign and we all have a copy of

763
00:40:52,050 --> 00:40:54,480
each of those acts that is the same

764
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:56,160
in all cases, because here we

765
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:58,680
we all protect it is no longer about what

766
00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:01,680
I lied about something, okay, it's about that

767
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:04,440
you guarantee me that they can't

768
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:05,910
to say that I have done something different from

769
00:41:05,910 --> 00:41:07,230
what is here because we have all

770
00:41:07,230 --> 00:41:08,700
signed this here is always the truth

771
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:10,630
in front

772
00:41:10,630 --> 00:41:12,940
that I find myself as a result of

773
00:41:12,940 --> 00:41:15,309
analysis of the forensic image that I

774
00:41:15,309 --> 00:41:18,990
I take from the hard drive that was left

775
00:41:18,990 --> 00:41:21,700
stored in the company sealed by the

776
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:24,700
notary I find a single partition

777
00:41:24,700 --> 00:41:26,589
normal formatted with a system

778
00:41:26,589 --> 00:41:29,500
ntfs files and whose creation date

779
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:32,109
from the mcc that is when it is formatted

780
00:41:32,109 --> 00:41:34,359
that file system is in date and

781
00:41:34,359 --> 00:41:37,410
time of the minutes approx 4 up to here well

782
00:41:37,410 --> 00:41:40,539
here and this part is kind of hard to watch

783
00:41:40,539 --> 00:41:42,190
and to understand but well let's

784
00:41:42,190 --> 00:41:44,090
try

785
00:41:44,090 --> 00:41:46,890
When we talk about analyzing a system

786
00:41:46,890 --> 00:41:50,120
of ntfs files we are going to meet

787
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:53,130
two games of four time we are

788
00:41:53,130 --> 00:41:55,200
different relative to each file or

789
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:57,390
every directory that is on the system

790
00:41:57,390 --> 00:42:00,420
of files some of which are of type s

791
00:42:00,420 --> 00:42:02,400
iii or standard information and others that

792
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:05,040
they are of type of cn or fire main are called

793
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:09,570
us those that are of type s iii and are in

794
00:42:09,570 --> 00:42:11,370
both cases are four are I'm going to

795
00:42:11,370 --> 00:42:13,740
focus only on the type s and they are

796
00:42:13,740 --> 00:42:16,410
those manageable through the api

797
00:42:16,410 --> 00:42:18,960
windows through a set time or

798
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:21,930
bedtime so that when there is a

799
00:42:21,930 --> 00:42:25,790
action on a file is altered

800
00:42:25,790 --> 00:42:30,030
update the time stand of that file and

801
00:42:30,030 --> 00:42:32,700
depending on what it is depending on what

802
00:42:32,700 --> 00:42:34,890
to be done a timestamp is updated u

803
00:42:34,890 --> 00:42:38,130
other st at a time istanbul when you

804
00:42:38,130 --> 00:42:42,180
create a file the date of the newly

805
00:42:42,180 --> 00:42:45,600
created the 4 timestamp are equal and the

806
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:48,420
date create the date you have is the

807
00:42:48,420 --> 00:42:51,099
that you have the creation date of the

808
00:42:51,099 --> 00:42:55,119
switch ok if you modify the content of

809
00:42:55,119 --> 00:42:57,579
that file is a text file

810
00:42:57,579 --> 00:42:59,290
which text element inside and I give it to

811
00:42:59,290 --> 00:43:01,540
save five minutes after having done it

812
00:43:01,540 --> 00:43:03,609
created that of creation is maintained and the

813
00:43:03,609 --> 00:43:07,119
of modification and is changed to five

814
00:43:07,119 --> 00:43:08,740
minutes later, that is, when it has

815
00:43:08,740 --> 00:43:11,950
saved that content last

816
00:43:11,950 --> 00:43:13,570
access is a bit random because

817
00:43:13,570 --> 00:43:14,790
Really

818
00:43:14,790 --> 00:43:17,650
can this windows configured what

819
00:43:17,650 --> 00:43:20,500
normal for it to be disabled

820
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:22,839
access time update ok

821
00:43:22,839 --> 00:43:26,980
a registration law that is read in the tc

822
00:43:26,980 --> 00:43:30,400
s 16th the chs is something something like that no

823
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:32,020
I remember right now how it is but come on

824
00:43:32,020 --> 00:43:35,230
the movie is in that particular one

825
00:43:35,230 --> 00:43:39,369
never update between quotes and

826
00:43:39,369 --> 00:43:43,510
in this theme time what shows us what

827
00:43:43,510 --> 00:43:44,829
that changed that is what when

828
00:43:44,829 --> 00:43:46,990
update is the last time it has

829
00:43:46,990 --> 00:43:48,339
changed for example that has been

830
00:43:48,339 --> 00:43:50,849
changed the permissions of a file

831
00:43:50,849 --> 00:43:53,230
that an attribute of the

832
00:43:53,230 --> 00:43:54,730
file has been done hidden has been done

833
00:43:54,730 --> 00:43:56,430
read-only

834
00:43:56,430 --> 00:43:59,619
or have been given permissions at the level of

835
00:43:59,619 --> 00:44:01,720
does the is so that the user can

836
00:44:01,720 --> 00:44:04,040
agree to listen and I say this because

837
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:05,470
formless

838
00:44:05,470 --> 00:44:08,710
now well when you believe when you

839
00:44:08,710 --> 00:44:10,750
copies a file that is on a system

840
00:44:10,750 --> 00:44:12,820
from ntfs files to other systems

841
00:44:12,820 --> 00:44:16,000
files in tps this case what happens

842
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:19,119
is that the creation date of the new

843
00:44:19,119 --> 00:44:22,060
file on the external hard drive is the

844
00:44:22,060 --> 00:44:24,160
of the date and time of the copy when

845
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:28,030
produces bag however the same thing happens

846
00:44:28,030 --> 00:44:30,010
with the access to be in a windows 10

847
00:44:30,010 --> 00:44:33,520
weeks are believed to be those of the moment

848
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:35,530
what is done is to collect say can

849
00:44:35,530 --> 00:44:38,020
for a file to be created and accessed

850
00:44:38,020 --> 00:44:40,990
in 2015 but if I copied it now in

851
00:44:40,990 --> 00:44:43,930
2022 to another site the new file whose

852
00:44:43,930 --> 00:44:45,760
more evident content and which original

853
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:48,880
ok going to have in the new system

854
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:52,119
files that the date of he that decree

855
00:44:52,119 --> 00:44:54,609
and the access time will be the ones from now

856
00:44:54,609 --> 00:44:58,540
however those of modification time and

857
00:44:58,540 --> 00:45:01,090
those of mfc mod time are going to be the

858
00:45:01,090 --> 00:45:04,780
originals that I had at the time

859
00:45:04,780 --> 00:45:06,820
all right

860
00:45:06,820 --> 00:45:09,280
ok then having this

861
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:11,200
behavior in the head and this varies

862
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:13,060
Windows 10 from certain

863
00:45:13,060 --> 00:45:15,040
Windows 10 versions onwards and

864
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:17,050
backwards this is a bit complex lo

865
00:45:17,050 --> 00:45:20,620
I admit but this case came out as

866
00:45:20,620 --> 00:45:23,260
it came out because it was

867
00:45:23,260 --> 00:45:25,990
of fine thread, that is, it was a surgeon

868
00:45:25,990 --> 00:45:27,640
you are going to see

869
00:45:27,640 --> 00:45:32,470
the client who reads as he takes out the

870
00:45:32,470 --> 00:45:35,740
information that I get from that let's say

871
00:45:35,740 --> 00:45:38,260
of the interpretation that I do tells me

872
00:45:38,260 --> 00:45:40,750
is that some of the files that I

873
00:45:40,750 --> 00:45:44,440
they are saying if they were on the pc but

874
00:45:44,440 --> 00:45:46,210
Others that they are telling me are

875
00:45:46,210 --> 00:45:48,220
the ones that were on my hard drive that I

876
00:45:48,220 --> 00:45:51,700
I had it in an expensive drawer, a client

877
00:45:51,700 --> 00:45:53,800
I have to do with this face that is me

878
00:45:53,800 --> 00:45:57,010
may be telling the truth or not i

879
00:45:57,010 --> 00:45:58,480
just in case

880
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:00,910
smith and no good well that's what I

881
00:46:00,910 --> 00:46:02,770
the client is saying I can't

882
00:46:02,770 --> 00:46:04,650
trust what the client is but if

883
00:46:04,650 --> 00:46:07,510
I have to interpret the evidence and

884
00:46:07,510 --> 00:46:09,460
see if your demo is supported

885
00:46:09,460 --> 00:46:11,320
with what you put because it may be

886
00:46:11,320 --> 00:46:13,210
miguel bosé or that he hires me but

887
00:46:13,210 --> 00:46:14,860
It can also be a person who

888
00:46:14,860 --> 00:46:17,190
is telling the truth i find

889
00:46:17,190 --> 00:46:19,930
I find that really those

890
00:46:19,930 --> 00:46:21,580
folders and files inside

891
00:46:21,580 --> 00:46:24,370
who were on the computer according to me

892
00:46:24,370 --> 00:46:26,470
says the client in what has copied the

893
00:46:26,470 --> 00:46:27,880
proficient

894
00:46:27,880 --> 00:46:30,700
is what has to happen the crisis john

895
00:46:30,700 --> 00:46:32,619
tenniel access time are always the same

896
00:46:32,619 --> 00:46:36,369
/ in each file and are between the time

897
00:46:36,369 --> 00:46:39,160
start dale of the cta that the end of

898
00:46:39,160 --> 00:46:40,720
the action of the clear expert the time that

899
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:43,119
it takes to copy a thing a site without

900
00:46:43,119 --> 00:46:46,480
however the immortal s and the snt more

901
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:49,569
time' are the originals that had good

902
00:46:49,569 --> 00:46:51,279
this is expected and normal

903
00:46:51,279 --> 00:46:53,740
what I am however those

904
00:46:53,740 --> 00:46:56,230
folders that according to the client were not

905
00:46:56,230 --> 00:46:58,370
in the computer

906
00:46:58,370 --> 00:47:01,490
I see that the same in the spectrum start

907
00:47:01,490 --> 00:47:04,880
before the normal style however the mod

908
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:08,090
time is the original the original that

909
00:47:08,090 --> 00:47:10,010
actually had the file when it is

910
00:47:10,010 --> 00:47:10,720
person

911
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:13,490
what was on the hard drive

912
00:47:13,490 --> 00:47:15,410
original yes since that record has

913
00:47:15,410 --> 00:47:18,050
copied to another like the mortal and the mst

914
00:47:18,050 --> 00:47:20,960
deadly are carried and kept with the

915
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:23,990
original would remain but the heretic

916
00:47:23,990 --> 00:47:27,920
we are so careful it is shown that it is of the

917
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:30,320
same day of the action of the expert but

918
00:47:30,320 --> 00:47:33,380
four hours before the notarial deed says

919
00:47:33,380 --> 00:47:36,110
which stated that the company

920
00:47:36,110 --> 00:47:38,150
they descended from the computer when it arrived

921
00:47:38,150 --> 00:47:40,210
the expert and notary

922
00:47:40,210 --> 00:47:42,830
Well, it can be warm that it wears

923
00:47:42,830 --> 00:47:44,690
on 20 days and really blast

924
00:47:44,690 --> 00:47:46,550
five minutes before it goes up don't you dare

925
00:47:46,550 --> 00:47:48,620
no one has looked at the events no one has

926
00:47:48,620 --> 00:47:51,560
looked at absolutely no artifacts

927
00:47:51,560 --> 00:47:54,350
of this person's system or user

928
00:47:54,350 --> 00:47:56,840
of this computer to be able to see if

929
00:47:56,840 --> 00:47:59,060
have you done something with that computer or not

930
00:47:59,060 --> 00:48:01,370
it really just got cold

931
00:48:01,370 --> 00:48:03,880
the existence of a listen

932
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:06,980
what happens is that it is

933
00:48:06,980 --> 00:48:09,800
finding me the mf we have time with a

934
00:48:09,800 --> 00:48:12,020
modification four hours before is

935
00:48:12,020 --> 00:48:14,570
perfectly compatible with that a

936
00:48:14,570 --> 00:48:16,880
administrator user has logged in

937
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:18,980
to the machine has copied the files

938
00:48:18,980 --> 00:48:22,210
on that person's desk or in a

939
00:48:22,210 --> 00:48:25,160
directory to which that other user

940
00:48:25,160 --> 00:48:28,570
had access and when you get into

941
00:48:28,570 --> 00:48:30,310
a

942
00:48:30,310 --> 00:48:32,600
directory that is not yours even if you are

943
00:48:32,600 --> 00:48:34,520
administrator tells you windows hey what

944
00:48:34,520 --> 00:48:35,900
know that you do not have permission to enter

945
00:48:35,900 --> 00:48:37,940
here but as you are administrator

946
00:48:37,940 --> 00:48:39,800
you want that is the one to give it to you yes for

947
00:48:39,800 --> 00:48:42,410
favor and automatically generates a cl

948
00:48:42,410 --> 00:48:45,800
which does an update of the mst

949
00:48:45,800 --> 00:48:47,069
mortal

950
00:48:47,069 --> 00:48:48,599
could also make there

951
00:48:48,599 --> 00:48:51,599
changed all to readonly and read

952
00:48:51,599 --> 00:48:53,579
writing or that were not hidden at all

953
00:48:53,579 --> 00:48:56,309
hidden but the way they go

954
00:48:56,309 --> 00:48:58,499
which is not exactly four hours

955
00:48:58,499 --> 00:49:00,150
before, but minutes change and

956
00:49:00,150 --> 00:49:02,009
seconds I see this in the master is missing

957
00:49:02,009 --> 00:49:04,499
and I'm going to say that there has been a process of

958
00:49:04,499 --> 00:49:07,009
do is this test the is empirically

959
00:49:07,009 --> 00:49:10,199
walesa i took another computer of mine i made a

960
00:49:10,199 --> 00:49:11,940
test create about 60 media access

961
00:49:11,940 --> 00:49:14,279
take out the emt and indeed the

962
00:49:14,279 --> 00:49:16,559
behavior was this at the level

963
00:49:16,559 --> 00:49:19,039
emergent therefore empirically

964
00:49:19,039 --> 00:49:21,509
I could tell that it was compatible with what

965
00:49:21,509 --> 00:49:23,940
that leaves all this good and the

966
00:49:23,940 --> 00:49:25,710
computer itself

967
00:49:25,710 --> 00:49:27,420
what it has is that the report

968
00:49:27,420 --> 00:49:30,210
contrary expert says that from the

969
00:49:30,210 --> 00:49:32,400
the files were created on its own computer

970
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:37,200
says it is impossible okay because first

971
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:39,599
It's impossible for me to prove it because

972
00:49:39,599 --> 00:49:41,160
the creation date of everything i

973
00:49:41,160 --> 00:49:43,950
I have really is the date of creation

974
00:49:43,950 --> 00:49:46,830
of the copy, that is to say, I do not have the

975
00:49:46,830 --> 00:49:48,660
original I have the copy if I had made

976
00:49:48,660 --> 00:49:52,080
this guy a previously image well

977
00:49:52,080 --> 00:49:54,570
well but it is that when I have gone there

978
00:49:54,570 --> 00:49:56,430
Well, let's see it exactly when you went

979
00:49:56,430 --> 00:49:58,500
but it was formatted I have

980
00:49:58,500 --> 00:50:01,050
carried the dates of the creation of the

981
00:50:01,050 --> 00:50:03,570
emt and I see that they are the next day

982
00:50:03,570 --> 00:50:06,510
of the dismissal therefore he is not here no

983
00:50:06,510 --> 00:50:08,339
there has been a lot, no, that is, it hasn't

984
00:50:08,339 --> 00:50:11,040
there was a possibility that I do that

985
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:12,690
acquisition in order to demonstrate a

986
00:50:12,690 --> 00:50:14,900
thing to the other not

987
00:50:14,900 --> 00:50:17,089
there is no disk image therefore

988
00:50:17,089 --> 00:50:18,859
as a disk image is not even

989
00:50:18,859 --> 00:50:20,210
have brought forensic artifacts from

990
00:50:20,210 --> 00:50:22,640
user ellen tauscher dot give ni los

991
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:24,589
recent nor the jungles to giuseppe the

992
00:50:24,589 --> 00:50:27,710
punctuate neither the keys nor anything at all

993
00:50:27,710 --> 00:50:29,510
nothing has been taken or preserved

994
00:50:29,510 --> 00:50:33,240
neither among other things

995
00:50:33,240 --> 00:50:35,190
the other part can say is that I

996
00:50:35,190 --> 00:50:38,369
keep that computer there motionless to me

997
00:50:38,369 --> 00:50:39,900
It costs me money, it's a computer, they're worth it.

998
00:50:39,900 --> 00:50:41,670
the invention two thousand euros thousand five hundred

999
00:50:41,670 --> 00:50:42,330
euro

1000
00:50:42,330 --> 00:50:44,280
I can not have it, there is to have a soul

1001
00:50:44,280 --> 00:50:46,770
of god that you can make an image of

1002
00:50:46,770 --> 00:50:48,360
disk and leave an image of the disk in

1003
00:50:48,360 --> 00:50:52,230
another site is okay or you can get the

1004
00:50:52,230 --> 00:50:54,000
hard drive what I did was look for the

1005
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,100
hard drive model that came with that

1006
00:50:56,100 --> 00:50:58,710
computer and saw how much it cost on amazon

1007
00:50:58,710 --> 00:51:01,800
and onion look for 50 euros you have a

1008
00:51:01,800 --> 00:51:03,840
hard drive the same, that is, for 50

1009
00:51:03,840 --> 00:51:05,130
euros you could have preserved the

1010
00:51:05,130 --> 00:51:08,360
audience and you didn't feel like it

1011
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:11,750
then it is clear what I see in the

1012
00:51:11,750 --> 00:51:13,520
computer is what it is besides that the

1013
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:16,100
concrete hardware

1014
00:51:16,100 --> 00:51:19,550
what does that computer have is newer than

1015
00:51:19,550 --> 00:51:22,160
when those other files were created

1016
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:25,660
ok and i can prove it ok

1017
00:51:25,660 --> 00:51:28,059
On the other hand, the expert report in

1018
00:51:28,059 --> 00:51:30,039
christian way was crap was

1019
00:51:30,039 --> 00:51:33,520
very bad but very bad savor all the

1020
00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:36,280
procedure was very wrong I already said that his

1021
00:51:36,280 --> 00:51:38,140
requirement was to find information

1022
00:51:38,140 --> 00:51:39,700
documents and data that allow to conclude

1023
00:51:39,700 --> 00:51:41,470
objectively that in said

1024
00:51:41,470 --> 00:51:42,819
computer equipment have been made

1025
00:51:42,819 --> 00:51:43,930
professional activities that are

1026
00:51:43,930 --> 00:51:46,630
unfair competition and uncle based on

1027
00:51:46,630 --> 00:51:49,780
that argues it

1028
00:51:49,780 --> 00:51:51,880
on the other hand it says that it is required

1029
00:51:51,880 --> 00:51:53,860
so that they copy all the files but

1030
00:51:53,860 --> 00:51:55,510
you have not copied the files you have done

1031
00:51:55,510 --> 00:51:57,190
a copy of only a few folders

1032
00:51:57,190 --> 00:51:59,800
those of tyson client there and that's it

1033
00:51:59,800 --> 00:52:01,510
then he concludes that he has taken

1034
00:52:01,510 --> 00:52:03,280
professional activity outside the company

1035
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:05,410
from a year well before hardware

1036
00:52:05,410 --> 00:52:07,360
basic processor more card the good

1037
00:52:07,360 --> 00:52:09,190
is that they may have changed this

1038
00:52:09,190 --> 00:52:11,260
It is no longer the same computer, it is worth what

1039
00:52:11,260 --> 00:52:14,050
but it is also that the way to test

1040
00:52:14,050 --> 00:52:17,080
that this user has done it is not to see

1041
00:52:17,080 --> 00:52:19,150
the existence of files that can

1042
00:52:19,150 --> 00:52:21,490
have been there or not and I have you

1043
00:52:21,490 --> 00:52:23,200
they may have planted there that is in my

1044
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:25,300
opinion what they have done with those who have not

1045
00:52:25,300 --> 00:52:27,220
they were on the computer according to my client

1046
00:52:27,220 --> 00:52:29,890
and really the client me when they see it

1047
00:52:29,890 --> 00:52:32,440
It's that Miguel Bosé is making me

1048
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:34,030
but it is that really later the

1049
00:52:34,030 --> 00:52:35,830
evidences because they gave him the reason

1050
00:52:35,830 --> 00:52:38,200
you know what and it is that as an expert I do not

1051
00:52:38,200 --> 00:52:39,700
I'm here to agree with my client

1052
00:52:39,700 --> 00:52:41,710
I am here to see if the evidence of

1053
00:52:41,710 --> 00:52:43,930
viewer that my expert says that my client

1054
00:52:43,930 --> 00:52:46,510
He tells the truth, I am for that, not for

1055
00:52:46,510 --> 00:52:48,430
something else then

1056
00:52:48,430 --> 00:52:51,500
So of course when you see this it says

1057
00:52:51,500 --> 00:52:53,089
Well, that you have everything done, it is

1058
00:52:53,089 --> 00:52:55,220
one side several very serious the artifice

1059
00:52:55,220 --> 00:52:58,220
has not preserved anything negligence or

1060
00:52:58,220 --> 00:52:59,930
failures in the analysis the analysis was

1061
00:52:59,930 --> 00:53:02,599
painful and you can not say that it is the

1062
00:53:02,599 --> 00:53:05,059
user activity has dealt with those

1063
00:53:05,059 --> 00:53:06,920
files when you haven't even parsed

1064
00:53:06,920 --> 00:53:09,020
user activity does not exist for

1065
00:53:09,020 --> 00:53:11,150
that I can see it if it's true no longer

1066
00:53:11,150 --> 00:53:13,430
there is a form of contradictory because

1067
00:53:13,430 --> 00:53:16,320
there really is no divide

1068
00:53:16,320 --> 00:53:18,780
the one that would have once we are time

1069
00:53:18,780 --> 00:53:21,150
updated four hours before

1070
00:53:21,150 --> 00:53:23,460
the expert arrives and the notary can

1071
00:53:23,460 --> 00:53:24,630
make me understand also that they have

1072
00:53:24,630 --> 00:53:26,270
searched for an expert sufficiently

1073
00:53:26,270 --> 00:53:28,590
well let's leave the limited

1074
00:53:28,590 --> 00:53:29,930
knowledge

1075
00:53:29,930 --> 00:53:32,030
so that really

1076
00:53:32,030 --> 00:53:35,490
when I got there there would be the files

1077
00:53:35,490 --> 00:53:38,190
and grappos yes yes yes they have created this

1078
00:53:38,190 --> 00:53:40,230
here but as white and as many

1079
00:53:40,230 --> 00:53:42,300
you can tell they were there but they weren't

1080
00:53:42,300 --> 00:53:43,980
you can say that they have created them bar

1081
00:53:43,980 --> 00:53:46,470
treated there because it is not true then

1082
00:53:46,470 --> 00:53:48,630
Apart from that, it is not possible to test whether

1083
00:53:48,630 --> 00:53:50,130
they created not from the dice because we

1084
00:53:50,130 --> 00:53:52,530
User artifacts have been made

1085
00:53:52,530 --> 00:53:55,470
of that user who demonstrates that

1086
00:53:55,470 --> 00:53:57,000
indeed it has opened them although it is

1087
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,640
There are those above who demonstrate

1088
00:53:59,640 --> 00:54:01,410
what changes have you even made to them

1089
00:54:01,410 --> 00:54:03,270
that you have agreed to be content that we

1090
00:54:03,270 --> 00:54:05,850
admire nothing regret

1091
00:54:05,850 --> 00:54:09,090
for this finish a game and ended in

1092
00:54:09,090 --> 00:54:12,330
a final traded at the gate

1093
00:54:12,330 --> 00:54:14,790
for good with my client they paid him I think

1094
00:54:14,790 --> 00:54:16,320
that everything I asked my client

1095
00:54:16,320 --> 00:54:18,450
gave a contrary report before

1096
00:54:18,450 --> 00:54:20,790
enter that god this is going to break us in

1097
00:54:20,790 --> 00:54:22,620
two and it really hurts that I was going with

1098
00:54:22,620 --> 00:54:25,860
you win because it is that he because when already

1099
00:54:25,860 --> 00:54:27,420
I mean when something

1100
00:54:27,420 --> 00:54:30,240
professionally it is badly done and it is

1101
00:54:30,240 --> 00:54:32,010
so badly done is that it really is a

1102
00:54:32,010 --> 00:54:34,410
shame what some people do

1103
00:54:34,410 --> 00:54:36,660
that is, there really is the harmed

1104
00:54:36,660 --> 00:54:39,270
is the other company that in quotes

1105
00:54:39,270 --> 00:54:41,760
because I think that part of having done

1106
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:43,800
things at hand also had the company

1107
00:54:43,800 --> 00:54:46,140
but what I am fairly clear is

1108
00:54:46,140 --> 00:54:48,780
that the expert is what he had to

1109
00:54:48,780 --> 00:54:51,030
make wings something else though because that

1110
00:54:51,030 --> 00:54:54,670
it was not done that way that was not done

1111
00:54:54,670 --> 00:54:56,800
well, this was a case of expert opinion

1112
00:54:56,800 --> 00:54:59,760
with me to my client because he was right

1113
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:02,290
initially it seemed to me that I was

1114
00:55:02,290 --> 00:55:03,940
counting a strange movie but no no

1115
00:55:03,940 --> 00:55:06,250
it was true what he said and then he

1116
00:55:06,250 --> 00:55:09,250
Second case I called him catch me if you can

1117
00:55:09,250 --> 00:55:13,030
this is very curious because it is good

1118
00:55:13,030 --> 00:55:16,150
from a company that calls me and tells me

1119
00:55:16,150 --> 00:55:19,240
who have an active hack on the

1120
00:55:19,240 --> 00:55:22,170
moment the client was really

1121
00:55:22,170 --> 00:55:25,630
terrified he told me that they printed him

1122
00:55:25,630 --> 00:55:28,180
stuff on company printers

1123
00:55:28,180 --> 00:55:32,290
Ok, well, it was a real company.

1124
00:55:32,290 --> 00:55:33,790
they were with the whole company stopped

1125
00:55:33,790 --> 00:55:36,250
because of course things were printed on them

1126
00:55:36,250 --> 00:55:39,050
the printers saying see you

1127
00:55:39,050 --> 00:55:40,810
I'm listening

1128
00:55:40,810 --> 00:55:43,760
there was something that implied that

1129
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:45,770
they knew the people inside or whatever

1130
00:55:45,770 --> 00:55:47,859
like very directed

1131
00:55:47,859 --> 00:55:49,900
but a company every time I count it

1132
00:55:49,900 --> 00:55:51,759
I say that it is from a different sector than

1133
00:55:51,759 --> 00:55:54,910
I am going to say that he was from that sector of the

1134
00:55:54,910 --> 00:55:58,239
roulette, well, what was done in the sector

1135
00:55:58,239 --> 00:56:00,309
food for example or industry

1136
00:56:00,309 --> 00:56:01,509
medieval is that I want to give me what

1137
00:56:01,509 --> 00:56:03,460
I am not going to tell you which sectors

1138
00:56:03,460 --> 00:56:06,519
the story is that the company

1139
00:56:06,519 --> 00:56:09,369
I was standing, they tell me what was happening

1140
00:56:09,369 --> 00:56:11,049
strange things sometimes had something to do

1141
00:56:11,049 --> 00:56:13,640
another poltergeist

1142
00:56:13,640 --> 00:56:15,529
and that about three months ago before

1143
00:56:15,529 --> 00:56:17,839
they called me to call me already with

1144
00:56:17,839 --> 00:56:20,150
all for I suggest in a denial of

1145
00:56:20,150 --> 00:56:22,330
web service

1146
00:56:22,330 --> 00:56:25,600
they left messages through the

1147
00:56:25,600 --> 00:56:27,670
company contact form

1148
00:56:27,670 --> 00:56:30,310
English but it was an English as we say

1149
00:56:30,310 --> 00:56:32,680
in spain english beach english

1150
00:56:32,680 --> 00:56:35,110
Juan Villar's beach shoes click well then

1151
00:56:35,110 --> 00:56:37,890
such a thing as very

1152
00:56:37,890 --> 00:56:40,350
wrong is like I think it was wrong

1153
00:56:40,350 --> 00:56:42,030
fact is english bet worth later

1154
00:56:42,030 --> 00:56:44,370
You will see why I no longer believe that the

1155
00:56:44,370 --> 00:56:46,280
person who wrote that

1156
00:56:46,280 --> 00:56:48,590
wrote badly or spoke so bad English

1157
00:56:48,590 --> 00:56:51,210
really, they even let him

1158
00:56:51,210 --> 00:56:53,640
messages in which they referred to a

1159
00:56:53,640 --> 00:56:56,460
person from within the company

1160
00:56:56,460 --> 00:56:59,640
direct, which implied that

1161
00:56:59,640 --> 00:57:03,240
there was something that wasn't, that is, it was someone

1162
00:57:03,240 --> 00:57:05,160
who knew there

1163
00:57:05,160 --> 00:57:07,920
then the messages also said that

1164
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:09,540
had we have access to your servers

1165
00:57:09,540 --> 00:57:10,860
we will do what we want

1166
00:57:10,860 --> 00:57:13,980
etcetera as they printed them with which

1167
00:57:13,980 --> 00:57:16,740
they said hey I'm seeing you they arrived

1168
00:57:16,740 --> 00:57:18,180
they had to turn off the cameras

1169
00:57:18,180 --> 00:57:20,760
that the client had in the sap company

1170
00:57:20,760 --> 00:57:25,230
I was scared alive and you are going to see the

1171
00:57:25,230 --> 00:57:27,200
barbarity that was this but of course

1172
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:29,480
when you see this it says where

1173
00:57:29,480 --> 00:57:31,310
I start not good well I what

1174
00:57:31,310 --> 00:57:34,090
I always recommend starting

1175
00:57:34,090 --> 00:57:36,010
for what we know we know

1176
00:57:36,010 --> 00:57:38,470
well that on one hand they have left me

1177
00:57:38,470 --> 00:57:42,940
messages in a contact mailbox in a

1178
00:57:42,940 --> 00:57:44,860
web of contacts initially but by

1179
00:57:44,860 --> 00:57:48,030
other part the last ones that I have

1180
00:57:48,030 --> 00:57:50,850
that they print things for me by my printers

1181
00:57:50,850 --> 00:57:54,810
therefore and they say that it also has

1182
00:57:54,810 --> 00:57:56,400
access to the cameras because I don't know

1183
00:57:56,400 --> 00:57:58,650
so what we do today in the

1184
00:57:58,650 --> 00:58:01,500
cameras keep those of something not a bit

1185
00:58:01,500 --> 00:58:04,830
I have to look hear the printers how

1186
00:58:04,830 --> 00:58:06,270
are printed because there are some servers of

1187
00:58:06,270 --> 00:58:08,820
impression we will look to see if it has

1188
00:58:08,820 --> 00:58:10,500
there have been print jobs there are no

1189
00:58:10,500 --> 00:58:12,590
that nothing is saved

1190
00:58:12,590 --> 00:58:15,090
it is seen that the person is bad

1191
00:58:15,090 --> 00:58:16,800
theoretically knows the person

1192
00:58:16,800 --> 00:58:18,510
commissioned here in the company by the

1193
00:58:18,510 --> 00:58:20,280
messages that we say then already

1194
00:58:20,280 --> 00:58:22,560
The only thing that remains is for the moment we will go

1195
00:58:22,560 --> 00:58:25,740
against the web server that is not because

1196
00:58:25,740 --> 00:58:27,150
be the only thing exposed to the internet

1197
00:58:27,150 --> 00:58:30,750
only but because it is also worth

1198
00:58:30,750 --> 00:58:33,810
that the evil one has had access against him

1199
00:58:33,810 --> 00:58:35,820
it is there here it is presented to the hand and

1200
00:58:35,820 --> 00:58:38,550
greeting I'm going to say rejection please

1201
00:58:38,550 --> 00:58:42,150
very good yesterday bad looking at the server

1202
00:58:42,150 --> 00:58:45,150
web this was a good linux machine

1203
00:58:45,150 --> 00:58:47,700
Well we started to get evidence of that

1204
00:58:47,700 --> 00:58:49,870
linux machine

1205
00:58:49,870 --> 00:58:52,000
looking at the vast user history

1206
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,190
admin it is seen that there was all the activity

1207
00:58:54,190 --> 00:58:55,840
of commands in which things are seen

1208
00:58:55,840 --> 00:58:57,610
that if they are suspicious that if they are

1209
00:58:57,610 --> 00:59:00,160
malicious is not the dates on which

1210
00:59:00,160 --> 00:59:02,200
who sent the messages to the

1211
00:59:02,200 --> 00:59:04,840
company but at all times there is a

1212
00:59:04,840 --> 00:59:08,020
lots of things the most manager and a

1213
00:59:08,020 --> 00:59:10,060
linux by default and depending on the

1214
00:59:10,060 --> 00:59:12,940
distribution does not save

1215
00:59:12,940 --> 00:59:15,760
at the date and time when it is typed

1216
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:16,810
a command when it has been executed

1217
00:59:16,810 --> 00:59:19,329
something then what we do for

1218
00:59:19,329 --> 00:59:22,000
identify when something has been executed

1219
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:23,859
or at least limit the times is

1220
00:59:23,859 --> 00:59:26,170
search for those commands you generated in

1221
00:59:26,170 --> 00:59:28,150
a file or generate an entry of

1222
00:59:28,150 --> 00:59:31,540
those of some kind and we know this was

1223
00:59:31,540 --> 00:59:33,190
on this date therefore what I would do

1224
00:59:33,190 --> 00:59:35,859
then it will be from now on and

1225
00:59:35,859 --> 00:59:37,270
whatever comes before is going to be from here to

1226
00:59:37,270 --> 00:59:39,609
ago identified several points in which

1227
00:59:39,609 --> 00:59:41,680
which can I assign a time date

1228
00:59:41,680 --> 00:59:43,900
executing a command can

1229
00:59:43,900 --> 00:59:45,450
decide

1230
00:59:45,450 --> 00:59:47,760
when or in what time ranges has

1231
00:59:47,760 --> 00:59:49,950
past these commands and look in the

1232
00:59:49,950 --> 00:59:51,690
connections that have been if there has been

1233
00:59:51,690 --> 00:59:53,460
there have been connections because this only

1234
00:59:53,460 --> 00:59:55,560
will remain when there has been a base

1235
00:59:55,560 --> 00:59:57,750
it is worth either in the local or because

1236
00:59:57,750 --> 00:59:59,430
the attacker has connected directly

1237
00:59:59,430 --> 01:00:02,490
by ssh for example the machine or has

1238
01:00:02,490 --> 01:00:05,339
sent a shell and then executed a

1239
01:00:05,339 --> 01:00:07,710
max there will be registered for me

1240
01:00:07,710 --> 01:00:09,869
bass history something if not this is not going to

1241
01:00:09,869 --> 01:00:11,579
pass there may be form of execution

1242
01:00:11,579 --> 01:00:13,890
remote command on machines that do not

1243
01:00:13,890 --> 01:00:15,480
are recorded in the history but

1244
01:00:15,480 --> 01:00:18,480
here was everything recorded that was seen was

1245
01:00:18,480 --> 01:00:19,859
would see the creation of a directory

1246
01:00:19,859 --> 01:00:22,200
hidden

1247
01:00:22,200 --> 01:00:24,660
hide a directory in linux that is

1248
01:00:24,660 --> 01:00:26,160
as easy as calling it with a period

1249
01:00:26,160 --> 01:00:27,630
in front of this there is no need to do anything

1250
01:00:27,630 --> 01:00:31,650
master for this and inside was the

1251
01:00:31,650 --> 01:00:35,550
jeep download with and grow is

1252
01:00:35,550 --> 01:00:37,530
tell those close that it is a free project

1253
01:00:37,530 --> 01:00:40,140
that what he does is requires something

1254
01:00:40,140 --> 01:00:42,869
interesting is a username and password

1255
01:00:42,869 --> 01:00:45,420
domain and what it does is inject

1256
01:00:45,420 --> 01:00:48,570
mimicry ok on windows machines to go

1257
01:00:48,570 --> 01:00:51,060
pulling credentials from memory

1258
01:00:51,060 --> 01:00:53,790
users of a domain well a stiller

1259
01:00:53,790 --> 01:00:56,730
of remote credentials in this case ok

1260
01:00:56,730 --> 01:00:58,380
very very interesting

1261
01:00:58,380 --> 01:01:00,570
well we found that obviously that

1262
01:01:00,570 --> 01:01:03,270
He has not done it with anyone from the company

1263
01:01:03,270 --> 01:01:04,580
for purposes

1264
01:01:04,580 --> 01:01:07,350
normal not dare legitimate and reproduction

1265
01:01:07,350 --> 01:01:09,270
but there it is seen that there is evil

1266
01:01:09,270 --> 01:01:11,430
I find more of these from the

1267
01:01:11,430 --> 01:01:13,530
admin user I feel good

1268
01:01:13,530 --> 01:01:15,900
copy of a file or a web path

1269
01:01:15,900 --> 01:01:18,150
curious because it also asks you here if

1270
01:01:18,150 --> 01:01:20,340
you have to place it on it to steal

1271
01:01:20,340 --> 01:01:22,890
www to director, that is, he has followed the

1272
01:01:22,890 --> 01:01:25,830
manual well as I say as a curiosity

1273
01:01:25,830 --> 01:01:27,210
execution of the tool requires a

1274
01:01:27,210 --> 01:01:29,360
domain and a user that is to say that who

1275
01:01:29,360 --> 01:01:32,010
run that has to have a user

1276
01:01:32,010 --> 01:01:33,810
domain or know a user of

1277
01:01:33,810 --> 01:01:36,720
domain to be able to do it is to say that

1278
01:01:36,720 --> 01:01:38,550
there has to be a chat there has to be

1279
01:01:38,550 --> 01:01:40,830
a preview of before having stolen or

1280
01:01:40,830 --> 01:01:42,240
got somewhere

1281
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:44,820
domain username and sucre password

1282
01:01:44,820 --> 01:01:47,020
for him

1283
01:01:47,020 --> 01:01:49,300
As I was saying when this happened, well, in

1284
01:01:49,300 --> 01:01:50,710
based on command execution

1285
01:01:50,710 --> 01:01:52,720
we identify with the file system

1286
01:01:52,720 --> 01:01:54,850
based on the creation and modification of

1287
01:01:54,850 --> 01:01:57,300
files in when things have happened

1288
01:01:57,300 --> 01:01:59,820
on the other hand a very curious thing

1289
01:01:59,820 --> 01:02:03,460
reading the story under 52 girls who

1290
01:02:03,460 --> 01:02:07,210
there were other history there were 13 create create

1291
01:02:07,210 --> 01:02:09,930
clear screen

1292
01:02:09,930 --> 01:02:13,079
options that's weird no this is weird

1293
01:02:13,079 --> 01:02:15,599
find that there is to create every so little

1294
01:02:15,599 --> 01:02:17,670
time option or not someone is you

1295
01:02:17,670 --> 01:02:20,520
looking from behind and you don't want to be seen

1296
01:02:20,520 --> 01:02:22,470
see what is coming up on the screen

1297
01:02:22,470 --> 01:02:25,020
but no option 2 you have a touch I'm not going

1298
01:02:25,020 --> 01:02:26,940
directly modified describes how

1299
01:02:26,940 --> 01:02:29,089
you see the screen

1300
01:02:29,089 --> 01:02:32,849
option option 2 on the other hand of

1301
01:02:32,849 --> 01:02:35,700
commands that are uncommon in the

1302
01:02:35,700 --> 01:02:38,640
execution as thor and world top is for

1303
01:02:38,640 --> 01:02:40,380
talking to another user is worth three

1304
01:02:40,380 --> 01:02:43,260
sessions the same is to send a message

1305
01:02:43,260 --> 01:02:45,030
to all users who are

1306
01:02:45,030 --> 01:02:46,740
connected in all the sessions there are

1307
01:02:46,740 --> 01:02:50,609
among other things you can see a happy new year goal

1308
01:02:50,609 --> 01:02:53,550
new or similar are worth exactly the same

1309
01:02:53,550 --> 01:02:56,250
It was at the end of the year or at the beginning and

1310
01:02:56,250 --> 01:03:00,000
see a goal happy new year seriously but

1311
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:03,720
Seriously in Spanish this but who you

1312
01:03:03,720 --> 01:03:05,460
is attacking trunk a professional a

1313
01:03:05,460 --> 01:03:07,400
[ __ ] troll

1314
01:03:07,400 --> 01:03:09,230
where it is clear I think the attacker

1315
01:03:09,230 --> 01:03:11,150
I was there entertained because there was

1316
01:03:11,150 --> 01:03:12,680
accessed a machine and then

1317
01:03:12,680 --> 01:03:14,770
felt like

1318
01:03:14,770 --> 01:03:17,319
the beggining

1319
01:03:17,319 --> 01:03:20,779
This man was loved more than him

1320
01:03:20,779 --> 01:03:22,339
president rivals himself new

1321
01:03:22,339 --> 01:03:26,119
total body that we keep looking at

1322
01:03:26,119 --> 01:03:29,000
keep looking and interesting file

1323
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:31,730
where there have been connections not the out

1324
01:03:31,730 --> 01:03:34,640
love point at the point the first thing you see

1325
01:03:34,640 --> 01:03:36,289
free brute force attempts

1326
01:03:36,289 --> 01:03:40,039
public that is to say by ssh that is to say that

1327
01:03:40,039 --> 01:03:42,079
be that here is exposed to the internet

1328
01:03:42,079 --> 01:03:43,940
we consult with the client and take it

1329
01:03:43,940 --> 01:03:46,970
before this exhibition it is good that is not

1330
01:03:46,970 --> 01:03:48,920
well but well let's see who it is

1331
01:03:48,920 --> 01:03:50,450
know from which addresses and pérez have

1332
01:03:50,450 --> 01:03:53,630
connected up to here everything from

1333
01:03:53,630 --> 01:03:56,690
a specific date date xx and now and

1334
01:03:56,690 --> 01:03:59,130
and i won't say when

1335
01:03:59,130 --> 01:04:01,530
a password change was observed

1336
01:04:01,530 --> 01:04:03,930
user admin called the customer today on

1337
01:04:03,930 --> 01:04:06,810
client has usually changed the

1338
01:04:06,810 --> 01:04:09,360
user's password on that date if

1339
01:04:09,360 --> 01:04:12,510
It sounds like I did it because things were already happening

1340
01:04:12,510 --> 01:04:14,730
rare we dropped the entire network

1341
01:04:14,730 --> 01:04:17,220
So I have sanctioned myself for

1342
01:04:17,220 --> 01:04:19,440
if so and how is this answer

1343
01:04:19,440 --> 01:04:22,230
Internet I changed the password

1344
01:04:22,230 --> 01:04:25,190
then the perfect good customer

1345
01:04:25,190 --> 01:04:29,460
immediately afterwards I begin to see attempts

1346
01:04:29,460 --> 01:04:31,740
manual failed authentication

1347
01:04:31,740 --> 01:04:35,490
initially they look okay or it looks when

1348
01:04:35,490 --> 01:04:37,590
I try it is failed manually and

1349
01:04:37,590 --> 01:04:39,570
when it's brute force when it's force

1350
01:04:39,570 --> 01:04:43,500
brute you see that everything happens very fast in the

1351
01:04:43,500 --> 01:04:45,870
same minute second when manual

1352
01:04:45,870 --> 01:04:48,660
there is a time between when someone writes

1353
01:04:48,660 --> 01:04:52,760
or type a something not then

1354
01:04:52,760 --> 01:04:56,160
asking we see that this was the

1355
01:04:56,160 --> 01:04:58,620
plateau than ip addresses that

1356
01:04:58,620 --> 01:05:00,920
failed attempts are recorded

1357
01:05:00,920 --> 01:05:03,330
come from IP addresses that according to me

1358
01:05:03,330 --> 01:05:05,250
says the client

1359
01:05:05,250 --> 01:05:06,770
the company

1360
01:05:06,770 --> 01:05:08,460
eye

1361
01:05:08,460 --> 01:05:11,760
or know that it is someone who has a pc

1362
01:05:11,760 --> 01:05:14,130
initially engaged in rank

1363
01:05:14,130 --> 01:05:16,430
company wireless

1364
01:05:16,430 --> 01:05:18,830
hours later the same pattern is observed

1365
01:05:18,830 --> 01:05:21,500
but now in brute force mode and at full

1366
01:05:21,500 --> 01:05:25,500
host is worth that yes from an ip

1367
01:05:25,500 --> 01:05:28,470
of the range of the wool of the internal network

1368
01:05:28,470 --> 01:05:32,430
Wi-Fi no longer ranges well and

1369
01:05:32,430 --> 01:05:34,170
curiously the next day there is a

1370
01:05:34,170 --> 01:05:36,510
satisfactory access to the first bone

1371
01:05:36,510 --> 01:05:39,660
that is to say without brute force and without any

1372
01:05:39,660 --> 01:05:42,870
nothing from range ip address

1373
01:05:42,870 --> 01:05:46,260
wifi from yesterday let's go to the same

1374
01:05:46,260 --> 01:05:50,340
day from the from the ip that there was

1375
01:05:50,340 --> 01:05:52,290
failed attempts the day before the day

1376
01:05:52,290 --> 01:05:53,820
next enter the first bear is

1377
01:05:53,820 --> 01:05:58,080
someone who already knows that password

1378
01:05:58,080 --> 01:06:00,120
some way but I don't see that here

1379
01:06:00,120 --> 01:06:02,820
there has been a full access access since

1380
01:06:02,820 --> 01:06:05,070
any of those ip is therefore what

1381
01:06:05,070 --> 01:06:06,810
must have gotten it another way

1382
01:06:06,810 --> 01:06:11,220
well ok and that is the wifi range is

1383
01:06:11,220 --> 01:06:12,780
someone who has access to Wi-Fi or a

1384
01:06:12,780 --> 01:06:15,740
pc that is tight on the bus

1385
01:06:15,740 --> 01:06:18,780
Well, listen to how they work here

1386
01:06:18,780 --> 01:06:20,610
whose ip addresses is this limit

1387
01:06:20,610 --> 01:06:23,400
fixed on this ip of the wifi network that

1388
01:06:23,400 --> 01:06:26,190
you have the pda the network plan in another I can

1389
01:06:26,190 --> 01:06:27,870
say that it is the client because here everything

1390
01:06:27,870 --> 01:06:30,240
works for htc ok with the tascas

1391
01:06:30,240 --> 01:06:31,950
and the servers work through the tv

1392
01:06:31,950 --> 01:06:34,260
well, well, how can you not do it to me?

1393
01:06:34,260 --> 01:06:36,660
say I'm going to go to the servers

1394
01:06:36,660 --> 01:06:40,050
hcp what do you have to see if there are logs I'm leaving

1395
01:06:40,050 --> 01:06:42,270
to the wifi network store the http there is the

1396
01:06:42,270 --> 01:06:43,980
corporate firewall we connect

1397
01:06:43,980 --> 01:06:47,430
we look there are no hot

1398
01:06:47,430 --> 01:06:50,340
there is no gray there is nothing that allows me

1399
01:06:50,340 --> 01:06:53,070
identify here in burning you

1400
01:06:53,070 --> 01:06:54,870
would allocate a bad idea through

1401
01:06:54,870 --> 01:06:57,840
from the mac he took out the hyper looking for the mac

1402
01:06:57,840 --> 01:06:59,220
in the company

1403
01:06:59,220 --> 01:07:03,540
obviously not good total that from

1404
01:07:03,540 --> 01:07:05,490
from there I say good and in the wool in the

1405
01:07:05,490 --> 01:07:08,640
land who gives you the one from hcp that's him

1406
01:07:08,640 --> 01:07:11,310
control controller I'm going to look and

1407
01:07:11,310 --> 01:07:14,790
there are no logs well there are no wait no

1408
01:07:14,790 --> 01:07:19,320
there is the order of hcp ok but but in the

1409
01:07:19,320 --> 01:07:21,840
domain controller one events

1410
01:07:21,840 --> 01:07:23,090
of my companions

1411
01:07:23,090 --> 01:07:26,500
this job in this case

1412
01:07:26,500 --> 01:07:28,900
we work a lot several colleagues

1413
01:07:28,900 --> 01:07:32,830
the time I say will be required urgently

1414
01:07:32,830 --> 01:07:34,720
and it was quite complicated but we were

1415
01:07:34,720 --> 01:07:37,870
pulling the ball you will see cut

1416
01:07:37,870 --> 01:07:39,940
and notices an event that is the

1417
01:07:39,940 --> 01:07:43,860
5800 7 on the domain controller

1418
01:07:43,860 --> 01:07:47,050
looking for this that during the range of

1419
01:07:47,050 --> 01:07:49,770
time that brute force lasted is worth

1420
01:07:49,770 --> 01:07:53,230
Look, you saw a message like this, no

1421
01:07:53,230 --> 01:07:55,300
It is this evidently of lack that I did

1422
01:07:55,300 --> 01:07:57,580
in the last 4 and 12 hours

1423
01:07:57,580 --> 01:07:59,620
there has been a connection to this sunday

1424
01:07:59,620 --> 01:08:02,050
controller from client machines whose

1425
01:08:02,050 --> 01:08:04,600
ip addresses are not the ones

1426
01:08:04,600 --> 01:08:06,310
correspond to the IP addresses of the

1427
01:08:06,310 --> 01:08:08,310
company

1428
01:08:08,310 --> 01:08:10,200
be alone that says and tells you towards

1429
01:08:10,200 --> 01:08:13,290
below this has been saved

1430
01:08:13,290 --> 01:08:15,510
printed and customer addresses and

1431
01:08:15,510 --> 01:08:17,939
I tell you and the hosting has remained in the

1432
01:08:17,939 --> 01:08:21,260
barfile debut netlog dot lo

1433
01:08:21,260 --> 01:08:24,960
well and only here that this message

1434
01:08:24,960 --> 01:08:27,569
it's taken from google and my is really

1435
01:08:27,569 --> 01:08:31,290
in my case it was not a connection it was 186

1436
01:08:31,290 --> 01:08:33,270
connections against domaine control

1437
01:08:33,270 --> 01:08:36,600
It is worth seeing as a team and specifically

1438
01:08:36,600 --> 01:08:40,200
it was a single ip address that looked

1439
01:08:40,200 --> 01:08:41,729
in a file that looks like

1440
01:08:41,729 --> 01:08:44,609
this one is worth you are going to see it now that

1441
01:08:44,609 --> 01:08:45,990
obviously not this one is also

1442
01:08:45,990 --> 01:08:48,710
removed google original image

1443
01:08:48,710 --> 01:08:52,819
and it is seen that it says it is to this file you

1444
01:08:52,819 --> 01:08:55,488
tells the date and time that we were

1445
01:08:55,488 --> 01:08:57,229
helped connect against the domain

1446
01:08:57,229 --> 01:09:00,109
controller and here only one appeared

1447
01:09:00,109 --> 01:09:02,600
wifi range ip address that is not

1448
01:09:02,600 --> 01:09:07,120
of the domain and a hotmail

1449
01:09:07,229 --> 01:09:08,850
and here is something that I have not told you

1450
01:09:08,850 --> 01:09:11,040
said and it is that in this company that

1451
01:09:11,040 --> 01:09:15,509
belonged to the random sector I knew

1452
01:09:15,509 --> 01:09:17,580
a person from the systems department

1453
01:09:17,580 --> 01:09:20,460
who worked in this company was not my

1454
01:09:20,460 --> 01:09:23,430
friend was not someone who left

1455
01:09:23,430 --> 01:09:27,238
way with him but I knew him from life

1456
01:09:27,238 --> 01:09:29,939
total that you are not going to imagine who

1457
01:09:29,939 --> 01:09:31,979
it was the ip and square name waiting for the

1458
01:09:31,979 --> 01:09:34,259
wifi range but whose corning was it if

1459
01:09:34,259 --> 01:09:36,450
of the person I knew in the

1460
01:09:36,450 --> 01:09:39,600
company download here I already stayed a

1461
01:09:39,600 --> 01:09:41,819
little hearing [ __ ] that everything points to

1462
01:09:41,819 --> 01:09:43,049
this person from the department of

1463
01:09:43,049 --> 01:09:45,299
systems as I explained this to the

1464
01:09:45,299 --> 01:09:49,049
client since explain I call the

1465
01:09:49,049 --> 01:09:50,790
client I tell him look we have reached

1466
01:09:50,790 --> 01:09:54,660
this point and of course it is not all points

1467
01:09:54,660 --> 01:09:56,370
that the people I know in this

1468
01:09:56,370 --> 01:09:59,280
company is his pc it doesn't have to be him

1469
01:09:59,280 --> 01:10:01,950
it could be the compromised computer

1470
01:10:01,950 --> 01:10:03,840
may have a problem in

1471
01:10:03,840 --> 01:10:05,790
computer and indeed there is someone

1472
01:10:05,790 --> 01:10:08,640
who pulls the strings from his computer and

1473
01:10:08,640 --> 01:10:10,350
is setting up all this mess is

1474
01:10:10,350 --> 01:10:12,989
possible, well, what I propose

1475
01:10:12,989 --> 01:10:15,060
to my client who is who to me

1476
01:10:15,060 --> 01:10:17,640
hire and pay me is

1477
01:10:17,640 --> 01:10:21,480
The first thing is take a notary to the

1478
01:10:21,480 --> 01:10:23,400
company to guarantee

1479
01:10:23,400 --> 01:10:25,440
worker so you can't say that

1480
01:10:25,440 --> 01:10:27,720
someone has modified the content of your

1481
01:10:27,720 --> 01:10:29,340
computer and that it is charging the

1482
01:10:29,340 --> 01:10:30,810
dead to this person be directly

1483
01:10:30,810 --> 01:10:34,110
hey look this is what it is and

1484
01:10:34,110 --> 01:10:36,360
directly from his hands you tear the

1485
01:10:36,360 --> 01:10:39,700
pc and what is it taken by the notary

1486
01:10:39,700 --> 01:10:42,610
it was the notary took the pc and up to date

1487
01:10:42,610 --> 01:10:43,290
Next

1488
01:10:43,290 --> 01:10:45,850
well this person also appeared

1489
01:10:45,850 --> 01:10:49,170
the company and I proposed

1490
01:10:49,170 --> 01:10:51,790
thinking that today it may happen that there is

1491
01:10:51,790 --> 01:10:54,670
been this person or not the one I want

1492
01:10:54,670 --> 01:10:56,350
have a meeting with this person with

1493
01:10:56,350 --> 01:10:59,320
my acquaintance and good I would like to see you hear

1494
01:10:59,320 --> 01:11:01,540
and he got a confession from him, what I did

1495
01:11:01,540 --> 01:11:04,390
that I arrived was to hey I want I have a

1496
01:11:04,390 --> 01:11:06,730
agreement with the company that they are not going to

1497
01:11:06,730 --> 01:11:09,940
dismiss nothing will happen but for

1498
01:11:09,940 --> 01:11:12,340
Please, if it was you, then confess what

1499
01:11:12,340 --> 01:11:16,270
say it there is no problem these people

1500
01:11:16,270 --> 01:11:17,980
they are good people they are good people they are

1501
01:11:17,980 --> 01:11:20,350
willing to forgive him is a person

1502
01:11:20,350 --> 01:11:22,210
young and good maybe the young

1503
01:11:22,210 --> 01:11:24,370
we do the [ __ ] many times or what

1504
01:11:24,370 --> 01:11:26,620
we have done this not so much but good

1505
01:11:26,620 --> 01:11:30,059
but those campilla people

1506
01:11:32,340 --> 01:11:36,220
Well, yes, in the end the guy gave me

1507
01:11:36,220 --> 01:11:39,750
said that it had not been that this was

1508
01:11:39,750 --> 01:11:42,850
I put miguel bosé back and that this

1509
01:11:42,850 --> 01:11:44,830
It is the fruit of a conspiracy but total that

1510
01:11:44,830 --> 01:11:46,720
that it was not then that sure that

1511
01:11:46,720 --> 01:11:49,210
someone was screwing up life and

1512
01:11:49,210 --> 01:11:50,980
He denied everything because I gave him the opportunity

1513
01:11:50,980 --> 01:11:53,680
that if it had been him he said so

1514
01:11:53,680 --> 01:11:56,140
that not total and that I did I went to

1515
01:11:56,140 --> 01:11:58,540
the notary before a notary acquire a

1516
01:11:58,540 --> 01:12:00,760
disk image of your computer and I

1517
01:12:00,760 --> 01:12:03,280
I safely brought me to the laboratory and

1518
01:12:03,280 --> 01:12:06,850
We analyze well analyzing that

1519
01:12:06,850 --> 01:12:07,860
contents

1520
01:12:07,860 --> 01:12:10,570
We are already beginning to see curious things

1521
01:12:10,570 --> 01:12:12,760
first there were actions of anti

1522
01:12:12,760 --> 01:12:16,090
forensics on one side and there wasn't much

1523
01:12:16,090 --> 01:12:18,340
trace just before the date on which

1524
01:12:18,340 --> 01:12:20,920
I start to do the research

1525
01:12:20,920 --> 01:12:22,300
of course obviously this person who

1526
01:12:22,300 --> 01:12:23,740
They know, wait, we have

1527
01:12:23,740 --> 01:12:26,350
hired securities to see if we

1528
01:12:26,350 --> 01:12:28,360
can you help with this by very well

1529
01:12:28,360 --> 01:12:30,280
things in life just from that

1530
01:12:30,280 --> 01:12:32,800
day from there to back there is almost no

1531
01:12:32,800 --> 01:12:34,690
information on the computer of this

1532
01:12:34,690 --> 01:12:37,330
person not another interesting thing is that

1533
01:12:37,330 --> 01:12:39,130
from the date I am hired

1534
01:12:39,130 --> 01:12:42,310
there were no attacks there were no things for

1535
01:12:42,310 --> 01:12:44,140
printers do not turn off things are going

1536
01:12:44,140 --> 01:12:46,330
the complete network did not fall there was not

1537
01:12:46,330 --> 01:12:49,210
attacks on the web server with the bird and

1538
01:12:49,210 --> 01:12:51,700
suddenly there were also executions of the

1539
01:12:51,700 --> 01:12:53,470
ccleaner program that as you know works

1540
01:12:53,470 --> 01:12:56,680
to clean things that have been in the

1541
01:12:56,680 --> 01:12:59,890
actions machine do not activity

1542
01:12:59,890 --> 01:13:02,260
and according to this person he justified his

1543
01:13:02,260 --> 01:13:04,210
responsible for the use of money if not

1544
01:13:04,210 --> 01:13:06,790
you know it's [ __ ] bad it's because it does

1545
01:13:06,790 --> 01:13:08,260
let the computer go very fast because

1546
01:13:08,260 --> 01:13:09,760
the windows is corrupted and goes away

1547
01:13:09,760 --> 01:13:10,840
filling with [ __ ] and degrading

1548
01:13:10,840 --> 01:13:13,750
he's right the man is that I'm a

1549
01:13:13,750 --> 01:13:15,760
powerful computer the hard drive that was

1550
01:13:15,760 --> 01:13:18,370
ss of the installation of was a windows

1551
01:13:18,370 --> 01:13:20,170
10 that had been installed less ago

1552
01:13:20,170 --> 01:13:22,960
of a year therefore it does not add up to me that

1553
01:13:22,960 --> 01:13:25,690
the degradation of the machine has been

1554
01:13:25,690 --> 01:13:27,400
big enough to get to this point

1555
01:13:27,400 --> 01:13:29,080
you had to run this kleenex

1556
01:13:29,080 --> 01:13:31,360
as if you had a hard drive

1557
01:13:31,360 --> 01:13:34,210
old hard drive and not that that

1558
01:13:34,210 --> 01:13:35,620
was very slow and indeed

1559
01:13:35,620 --> 01:13:39,520
it would be convenient to do it that way

1560
01:13:39,520 --> 01:13:41,070
done it looks like the ccleaner

1561
01:13:41,070 --> 01:13:44,500
installed it three days before the last

1562
01:13:44,500 --> 01:13:48,880
execution of tgn and executed it all

1563
01:13:48,880 --> 01:13:51,700
the days for the end of the month that is to say that

1564
01:13:51,700 --> 01:13:53,160
all this that uncle told me and

1565
01:13:53,160 --> 01:13:56,840
cheering up but it's 2

1566
01:13:56,840 --> 01:13:59,050
It doesn't look like it

1567
01:13:59,050 --> 01:14:02,030
well total that man and here we have

1568
01:14:02,030 --> 01:14:05,110
I have a video of the guy

1569
01:14:09,020 --> 01:14:11,120
this already solved the problem and

1570
01:14:11,120 --> 01:14:12,950
that now comes for that reason

1571
01:14:12,950 --> 01:14:15,170
review this that will give exactly

1572
01:14:15,170 --> 01:14:16,720
the same because it will not be possible

1573
01:14:16,720 --> 01:14:21,740
find more but there is a file that is

1574
01:14:21,740 --> 01:14:25,580
the consortium history dot txtr that lo

1575
01:14:25,580 --> 01:14:27,290
that saves inside the user of this

1576
01:14:27,290 --> 01:14:28,740
person

1577
01:14:28,740 --> 01:14:31,620
was the commands executed in power se

1578
01:14:31,620 --> 01:14:33,540
makes you have at least in this

1579
01:14:33,540 --> 01:14:36,270
non-clean version that is what it looked like

1580
01:14:36,270 --> 01:14:38,670
you saw scripting in python up to here

1581
01:14:38,670 --> 01:14:40,320
all good would be installation of the module

1582
01:14:40,320 --> 01:14:41,550
for me as for connections

1583
01:14:41,550 --> 01:14:44,280
interestingly ssh is to say to do

1584
01:14:44,280 --> 01:14:46,380
brute force for example by ssh well

1585
01:14:46,380 --> 01:14:48,030
quietly for me that you're going

1586
01:14:48,030 --> 01:14:49,770
testing no ideas and program in pay with

1587
01:14:49,770 --> 01:14:51,990
request to make web requests this

1588
01:14:51,990 --> 01:14:56,020
is not actually binding

1589
01:14:56,020 --> 01:14:59,200
an egg of executions of

1590
01:14:59,200 --> 01:15:00,220
clear

1591
01:15:00,220 --> 01:15:04,350
once again the touch is worth or not

1592
01:15:04,350 --> 01:15:07,120
had to see things on the screen that

1593
01:15:07,120 --> 01:15:10,960
They didn't add up or just what's wrong

1594
01:15:10,960 --> 01:15:14,380
when he's powers he's a screen on

1595
01:15:14,380 --> 01:15:16,300
blue and when you execute something and it

1596
01:15:16,300 --> 01:15:18,610
you execute wrong you get something in red

1597
01:15:18,610 --> 01:15:20,320
What leaves you blind is that with glasses

1598
01:15:20,320 --> 01:15:22,330
sun to read it and not let you

1599
01:15:22,330 --> 01:15:25,150
blind so if someone passes by

1600
01:15:25,150 --> 01:15:27,220
behind and sees it because indeed it can

1601
01:15:27,220 --> 01:15:29,410
give rise to that say what the hell

1602
01:15:29,410 --> 01:15:30,820
is this guy doing that he doesn't have to

1603
01:15:30,820 --> 01:15:33,850
do this then hence the clear in

1604
01:15:33,850 --> 01:15:36,820
mode to brutes on your pc many clear

1605
01:15:36,820 --> 01:15:39,430
on linux machine with lots of

1606
01:15:39,430 --> 01:15:41,710
clearly illegitimate activity and

1607
01:15:41,710 --> 01:15:46,270
catty and many clear ya tie for

1608
01:15:46,270 --> 01:15:48,490
behavior though I know

1609
01:15:48,490 --> 01:15:51,190
what else but then let's start

1610
01:15:51,190 --> 01:15:53,260
analyze and remove the artifacts

1611
01:15:53,260 --> 01:15:54,970
user forensics that must be removed

1612
01:15:54,970 --> 01:15:57,250
a user to see their activity that

1613
01:15:57,250 --> 01:15:59,560
we get out of here attempts are seen

1614
01:15:59,560 --> 01:16:04,420
event of 30 thousand 803 samba and when

1615
01:16:04,420 --> 01:16:06,790
client fails to map a drive

1616
01:16:06,790 --> 01:16:08,560
obviously when you don't know one

1617
01:16:08,560 --> 01:16:11,140
password of something you try to access it

1618
01:16:11,140 --> 01:16:13,090
beast for something is going to give you this

1619
01:16:13,090 --> 01:16:15,130
error and you are left on the pc side in the

1620
01:16:15,130 --> 01:16:18,079
client side I'm not going to do this

1621
01:16:18,079 --> 01:16:19,999
in the jungles access to resources

1622
01:16:19,999 --> 01:16:21,459
shared

1623
01:16:21,459 --> 01:16:24,769
where you have navigated at the systems level

1624
01:16:24,769 --> 01:16:27,189
of files this person this user

1625
01:16:27,189 --> 01:16:30,260
had literally tried to enter and in

1626
01:16:30,260 --> 01:16:32,809
reality had entered all that

1627
01:16:32,809 --> 01:16:36,199
shared that the whole company had

1628
01:16:36,199 --> 01:16:39,379
all the ips were seen one by one attempt

1629
01:16:39,379 --> 01:16:41,329
barraza dollar bars get before the cde today

1630
01:16:41,329 --> 01:16:43,639
dollar did not look good in some cases

1631
01:16:43,639 --> 01:16:46,939
and it looked like this shows us the folders

1632
01:16:46,939 --> 01:16:48,439
or shared resources for which you have

1633
01:16:48,439 --> 01:16:51,109
entered a person does not show me what

1634
01:16:51,109 --> 01:16:52,999
There is, but well, that is, he has entered

1635
01:16:52,999 --> 01:16:56,689
sites in which they try after

1636
01:16:56,689 --> 01:16:59,570
your user this is no longer an activity

1637
01:16:59,570 --> 01:17:03,130
normal of a normal user

1638
01:17:03,130 --> 01:17:05,110
on dates and times of use of the

1639
01:17:05,110 --> 01:17:08,320
printer to print the famous see you

1640
01:17:08,320 --> 01:17:11,889
Is it me or do these things happen, okay, there was

1641
01:17:11,889 --> 01:17:14,080
a user session started there is a

1642
01:17:14,080 --> 01:17:16,630
prefect that demonstrates that the break is

1643
01:17:16,630 --> 01:17:19,630
executed maybe download using the

1644
01:17:19,630 --> 01:17:23,290
I don't have navigation but I do have it

1645
01:17:23,290 --> 01:17:26,860
in the execution of break and previ you know

1646
01:17:26,860 --> 01:17:28,989
what is a browser that has a google

1647
01:17:28,989 --> 01:17:31,170
chrome below is worth bazán chromium and

1648
01:17:31,170 --> 01:17:34,300
the installation of the cec liner or surprise

1649
01:17:34,300 --> 01:17:37,710
right there not around on those dates

1650
01:17:37,710 --> 01:17:41,050
looking at the link this is seen in the same

1651
01:17:41,050 --> 01:17:43,360
master is missing and usb secure erased here

1652
01:17:43,360 --> 01:17:44,710
looks over writing and name change

1653
01:17:44,710 --> 01:17:48,010
of files from the cache or from the

1654
01:17:48,010 --> 01:17:51,880
navigation in this case of google chrome

1655
01:17:51,880 --> 01:17:54,340
that is to say that you have tried that you have gone to

1656
01:17:54,340 --> 01:17:58,160
delete otherwise

1657
01:17:58,160 --> 01:18:00,719
I have the 10 minutes that you used

1658
01:18:00,719 --> 01:18:03,480
Jaime I say it because I didn't take them off

1659
01:18:03,480 --> 01:18:05,250
that I have calculated for an hour

1660
01:18:05,250 --> 01:18:06,810
acclaimed in case you leave me 10 minutes

1661
01:18:06,810 --> 01:18:09,260
with sorry but you don't need then

1662
01:18:09,260 --> 01:18:11,360
as I say

1663
01:18:11,360 --> 01:18:14,090
to try to identify

1664
01:18:14,090 --> 01:18:17,310
let's say the ip address that had the

1665
01:18:17,310 --> 01:18:19,080
machine we see that in the software

1666
01:18:19,080 --> 01:18:21,090
installed has teamviewer ok

1667
01:18:21,090 --> 01:18:22,710
machine can be accessed by teamviewer

1668
01:18:22,710 --> 01:18:25,739
or use teamviewer to access

1669
01:18:25,739 --> 01:18:29,730
to other teams there is a file that

1670
01:18:29,730 --> 01:18:31,949
is the local teamviewer that when

1671
01:18:31,949 --> 01:18:34,760
starts the service what it does is

1672
01:18:34,760 --> 01:18:37,050
save record on one line this will

1673
01:18:37,050 --> 01:18:39,329
never does this if I'm not mistaken

1674
01:18:39,329 --> 01:18:43,949
keeps record of the ip that has to

1675
01:18:43,949 --> 01:18:45,770
we meet

1676
01:18:45,770 --> 01:18:48,500
calculating the difference between you and

1677
01:18:48,500 --> 01:18:52,730
the real time in this case Spanish

1678
01:18:52,730 --> 01:18:55,490
we found that the ip that had this

1679
01:18:55,490 --> 01:18:56,810
machine at a time that started the

1680
01:18:56,810 --> 01:18:59,000
teamviewer service was out of range

1681
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:01,430
wifi that we had seen as attempts to

1682
01:19:01,430 --> 01:19:05,590
brute force access to web server

1683
01:19:05,590 --> 01:19:07,480
who were at the out point of love

1684
01:19:07,480 --> 01:19:09,849
linux server on the other hand has the

1685
01:19:09,849 --> 01:19:12,369
food installed when you use put it

1686
01:19:12,369 --> 01:19:14,320
and it serves to connect you for example by

1687
01:19:14,320 --> 01:19:17,469
ssh among other things to be like this to

1688
01:19:17,469 --> 01:19:19,410
systems

1689
01:19:19,410 --> 01:19:22,800
as a user artifact they keep us in

1690
01:19:22,800 --> 01:19:26,310
the inside of a fingerprint that

1691
01:19:26,310 --> 01:19:29,520
uniquely identifies the certificate

1692
01:19:29,520 --> 01:19:32,130
from an ssh server which disconnected

1693
01:19:32,130 --> 01:19:34,380
and its correspondent with an address

1694
01:19:34,380 --> 01:19:37,170
ip this what is it for me is it for

1695
01:19:37,170 --> 01:19:39,330
the one for what is it good for putin so that

1696
01:19:39,330 --> 01:19:42,330
if you connect to 1926 811 by

1697
01:19:42,330 --> 01:19:45,930
example and that 11 has a certificate

1698
01:19:45,930 --> 01:19:49,650
different from useful life that eye that I the

1699
01:19:49,650 --> 01:19:51,960
that I have saved here is different than

1700
01:19:51,960 --> 01:19:53,730
the end the first certificate that is me

1701
01:19:53,730 --> 01:19:55,530
showing the current connection so

1702
01:19:55,530 --> 01:19:57,570
so much you can be the victim of a

1703
01:19:57,570 --> 01:19:59,310
man in the middle attack not then

1704
01:19:59,310 --> 01:20:02,370
for that it is saved initially but at

1705
01:20:02,370 --> 01:20:04,020
me for forensic purposes it serves me for

1706
01:20:04,020 --> 01:20:06,530
know which servers you have connected to

1707
01:20:06,530 --> 01:20:09,060
that user because it is an artifact of

1708
01:20:09,060 --> 01:20:11,520
interior user be about to give in a

1709
01:20:11,520 --> 01:20:13,910
certain moment is worth or at least

1710
01:20:13,910 --> 01:20:16,710
from that user

1711
01:20:16,710 --> 01:20:19,110
among others we see the web server

1712
01:20:19,110 --> 01:20:21,420
directly through the hyperprivate from

1713
01:20:21,420 --> 01:20:24,930
inside and be careful a server is xy

1714
01:20:24,930 --> 01:20:28,200
who was in the company to all this

1715
01:20:28,200 --> 01:20:30,060
I ask the client and this server yes

1716
01:20:30,060 --> 01:20:32,280
What's the time? Let's do it.

1717
01:20:32,280 --> 01:20:33,930
in control on file servers

1718
01:20:33,930 --> 01:20:35,640
normal in a company or one's own

1719
01:20:35,640 --> 01:20:37,610
Web server

1720
01:20:37,610 --> 01:20:41,640
says hey and the service drop is

1721
01:20:41,640 --> 01:20:43,680
so of course we really had to

1722
01:20:43,680 --> 01:20:46,410
restart the whole set and yeah and we had to

1723
01:20:46,410 --> 01:20:48,600
do things because indeed

1724
01:20:48,600 --> 01:20:52,200
there were certain moments when

1725
01:20:52,200 --> 01:20:55,290
which the whole company fell

1726
01:20:55,290 --> 01:20:57,090
it was tastier when they started

1727
01:20:57,090 --> 01:21:00,120
these attacks and give you access to is x y

1728
01:21:00,120 --> 01:21:02,580
we connect alexis and of course here he

1729
01:21:02,580 --> 01:21:04,620
Trias is different, that is, there is no, I do not have

1730
01:21:04,620 --> 01:21:06,560
a tool to do this but

1731
01:21:06,560 --> 01:21:08,850
we remove those files that we

1732
01:21:08,850 --> 01:21:11,030
save information in this case games

1733
01:21:11,030 --> 01:21:14,720
at the out point you can see it

1734
01:21:14,720 --> 01:21:17,210
eyes because a physical that yes you

1735
01:21:17,210 --> 01:21:20,480
guard the glass of xx and that guards the

1736
01:21:20,480 --> 01:21:22,250
date and time of execution

1737
01:21:22,250 --> 01:21:24,950
command that saves the

1738
01:21:24,950 --> 01:21:28,000
with that it shows me connections

1739
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:31,580
from the ip of the wifi range of the pc this

1740
01:21:31,580 --> 01:21:33,740
that I have told you forgive me it is not here or

1741
01:21:33,740 --> 01:21:35,840
maybe it obviously saves the date

1742
01:21:35,840 --> 01:21:37,970
and time of connection from an ip and in the

1743
01:21:37,970 --> 01:21:39,800
next file that I will show you is

1744
01:21:39,800 --> 01:21:42,320
the resemblance to bash history saves us

1745
01:21:42,320 --> 01:21:43,700
the date and time of execution of each

1746
01:21:43,700 --> 01:21:46,910
command by dante m ahead of me but what

1747
01:21:46,910 --> 01:21:48,650
important is that here I have the

1748
01:21:48,650 --> 01:21:51,080
connection from wifi range the ip that

1749
01:21:51,080 --> 01:21:54,440
you lie in wifi range on the date on

1750
01:21:54,440 --> 01:21:56,270
which was born to fight web server that is

1751
01:21:56,270 --> 01:21:59,000
that it has been from that ip that I also know

1752
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:01,700
that pc had it because teamviewer me

1753
01:22:01,700 --> 01:22:03,050
is saying it and why am I watching

1754
01:22:03,050 --> 01:22:04,790
that malicious activity calls

1755
01:22:04,790 --> 01:22:07,020
quite focused indeed

1756
01:22:07,020 --> 01:22:09,180
and on the other hand I see connections in

1757
01:22:09,180 --> 01:22:10,680
different to see two blocks of

1758
01:22:10,680 --> 01:22:13,200
connections from the hyper range of the

1759
01:22:13,200 --> 01:22:15,510
lnd the same pc of that person of mine

1760
01:22:15,510 --> 01:22:18,330
known at the date that he was also

1761
01:22:18,330 --> 01:22:21,200
confirmed by titles to that at the end

1762
01:22:21,200 --> 01:22:24,120
indeed it is seen that these times

1763
01:22:24,120 --> 01:22:25,890
had connected in two different ranges

1764
01:22:25,890 --> 01:22:28,920
from dates to this is x y in the bar bar

1765
01:22:28,920 --> 01:22:31,050
I know the point what is where I

1766
01:22:31,050 --> 01:22:33,630
they put things away looking through the ranks

1767
01:22:33,630 --> 01:22:36,310
of dates I meet is

1768
01:22:36,310 --> 01:22:38,200
there are some things that are a bit

1769
01:22:38,200 --> 01:22:40,090
you miss an ls to see things that are there

1770
01:22:40,090 --> 01:22:42,070
that route very well and inside that there is

1771
01:22:42,070 --> 01:22:44,230
when it is heard I will be root the same there is not

1772
01:22:44,230 --> 01:22:46,240
nothing and that's why the guy arrive and execute

1773
01:22:46,240 --> 01:22:48,280
sudo su but crumbs and now root

1774
01:22:48,280 --> 01:22:51,310
sudoku will lead you to ruth again no

1775
01:22:51,310 --> 01:22:53,500
he is already accustomed to

1776
01:22:53,500 --> 01:22:55,960
connect to a specific machine

1777
01:22:55,960 --> 01:22:57,970
with a non-privileged user and does a

1778
01:22:57,970 --> 01:23:01,360
sudoku to serve ok clear screen

1779
01:23:01,360 --> 01:23:03,430
nuclear man finally what things no longer

1780
01:23:03,430 --> 01:23:06,130
I missed him well but if he is going

1781
01:23:06,130 --> 01:23:07,330
reading down does not

1782
01:23:07,330 --> 01:23:09,280
absolutely nothing useful in this

1783
01:23:09,280 --> 01:23:12,280
machine and what it does and when it already

1784
01:23:12,280 --> 01:23:15,280
we see the world the top creating we say

1785
01:23:15,280 --> 01:23:18,280
well let's see the investigation goes

1786
01:23:18,280 --> 01:23:20,770
stupendously it is clear that the

1787
01:23:20,770 --> 01:23:23,520
execution is the same person based on

1788
01:23:23,520 --> 01:23:26,380
comma running looking at the other

1789
01:23:26,380 --> 01:23:28,440
time range

1790
01:23:28,440 --> 01:23:30,870
the second of the connections the second

1791
01:23:30,870 --> 01:23:33,210
of these connections with the ip of the range

1792
01:23:33,210 --> 01:23:35,280
land and look here it seems that it has been

1793
01:23:35,280 --> 01:23:36,480
documented a little fact good

1794
01:23:36,480 --> 01:23:38,460
I want to do evil here I don't know very well

1795
01:23:38,460 --> 01:23:40,830
what but I [ __ ] on the [ __ ] and I go and

1796
01:23:40,830 --> 01:23:43,620
So what does he see, he says, well, I'm going

1797
01:23:43,620 --> 01:23:45,870
to execute those commands as well as with

1798
01:23:45,870 --> 01:23:47,790
rare characters not these characters

1799
01:23:47,790 --> 01:23:50,400
really what they do is a way not

1800
01:23:50,400 --> 01:23:52,590
try to run a delegation

1801
01:23:52,590 --> 01:23:55,260
service based on the execution of a

1802
01:23:55,260 --> 01:23:57,510
lot of come from let's say consumption

1803
01:23:57,510 --> 01:23:59,580
by maximum number of the process and that makes

1804
01:23:59,580 --> 01:24:01,710
currently on some linux machines

1805
01:24:01,710 --> 01:24:03,120
that are not configured correctly than the

1806
01:24:03,120 --> 01:24:06,390
machine collapse ipec good as not

1807
01:24:06,390 --> 01:24:08,940
it worked says to see if it is necessary

1808
01:24:08,940 --> 01:24:11,070
putting a sh or after it doesn't work either

1809
01:24:11,070 --> 01:24:13,260
wait I put a max in front to see

1810
01:24:13,260 --> 01:24:15,510
later they don't let him give and he has

1811
01:24:15,510 --> 01:24:18,840
more this the same does not hear you have the look at

1812
01:24:18,840 --> 01:24:20,760
be if it has no because when executing the ch

1813
01:24:20,760 --> 01:24:23,969
ball power interactive and selfa ssh goes

1814
01:24:23,969 --> 01:24:24,820
To be

1815
01:24:24,820 --> 01:24:28,429
sh the ones who have this I don't know what anymore

1816
01:24:28,429 --> 01:24:30,800
to do but I'll see you I'm bored

1817
01:24:30,800 --> 01:24:33,020
wait and be the root seats and am

1818
01:24:33,020 --> 01:24:36,110
root save anything not and for

1819
01:24:36,110 --> 01:24:38,570
see the crux of the user with which

1820
01:24:38,570 --> 01:24:40,309
is connected by as questions of their

1821
01:24:40,309 --> 01:24:41,989
sons ruth and you are logged in as root

1822
01:24:41,989 --> 01:24:45,230
totally good god that the guy tries

1823
01:24:45,230 --> 01:24:47,329
delete the murban which is a directory

1824
01:24:47,329 --> 01:24:48,429
hard

1825
01:24:48,429 --> 01:24:51,139
good thing it is generated every time at startup

1826
01:24:51,139 --> 01:24:53,480
store important information

1827
01:24:53,480 --> 01:24:54,980
server and to return to

1828
01:24:54,980 --> 01:24:56,690
regenerate I have to go out again

1829
01:24:56,690 --> 01:24:58,250
wanted to make the mother come back

1830
01:24:58,250 --> 01:25:01,010
restart no but hey you can live

1831
01:25:01,010 --> 01:25:03,829
without it hears and the machines that there were

1832
01:25:03,829 --> 01:25:07,070
here that were not open runs there will be

1833
01:25:07,070 --> 01:25:08,270
done something inside some machine

1834
01:25:08,270 --> 01:25:10,039
virtual is playing now already as we have

1835
01:25:10,039 --> 01:25:11,840
that we can look at all this we are going to

1836
01:25:11,840 --> 01:25:12,970
To die

1837
01:25:12,970 --> 01:25:16,150
Well, the client indicates that here in addition

1838
01:25:16,150 --> 01:25:17,800
of the production machines that were

1839
01:25:17,800 --> 01:25:20,710
there were lab machines watching

1840
01:25:20,710 --> 01:25:22,600
we see that there is a machine for root and

1841
01:25:22,600 --> 01:25:25,420
leaving the [ __ ] that can see here well

1842
01:25:25,420 --> 01:25:27,880
looking at the modification dates of

1843
01:25:27,880 --> 01:25:30,100
the vm files of each of this machine

1844
01:25:30,100 --> 01:25:32,260
parrot we see that the dates are

1845
01:25:32,260 --> 01:25:34,480
previous are several months previous

1846
01:25:34,480 --> 01:25:37,930
I will have installed it I don't know but I don't know

1847
01:25:37,930 --> 01:25:39,250
has used because if it had torn off

1848
01:25:39,250 --> 01:25:42,010
and your right to use that goes up medical

1849
01:25:42,010 --> 01:25:44,170
the medical achievement modification date

1850
01:25:44,170 --> 01:25:47,020
it would be later it would not be of a moment

1851
01:25:47,020 --> 01:25:49,590
for more current however looking at the one

1852
01:25:49,590 --> 01:25:52,360
configuration file for that country and

1853
01:25:52,360 --> 01:25:55,720
from that to roth this here my partner

1854
01:25:55,720 --> 01:25:58,450
Miguel who has a special radar for

1855
01:25:58,450 --> 01:26:01,570
these things went to look at this and says

1856
01:26:01,570 --> 01:26:03,250
is that it is configured so that the

1857
01:26:03,250 --> 01:26:06,430
boot either from iso from iso

1858
01:26:06,430 --> 01:26:08,830
from the parrot cd that is downloaded

1859
01:26:08,830 --> 01:26:10,660
inside the filesystem of the xx y

1860
01:26:10,660 --> 01:26:12,120
Thus

1861
01:26:12,120 --> 01:26:15,400
normal that the

1862
01:26:15,400 --> 01:26:17,830
files disks is booted for is

1863
01:26:17,830 --> 01:26:19,330
configured to boot in mode

1864
01:26:19,330 --> 01:26:22,869
like and what happens in las vegas stays

1865
01:26:22,869 --> 01:26:25,210
In Las Vegas you pay for it and the records don't

1866
01:26:25,210 --> 01:26:27,130
are modified does not change anything and is

1867
01:26:27,130 --> 01:26:29,320
quite complicated to tinker that without

1868
01:26:29,320 --> 01:26:30,090
embargo

1869
01:26:30,090 --> 01:26:34,900
the logs of that virtual machine if I

1870
01:26:34,900 --> 01:26:37,900
save the vm logs save vale del

1871
01:26:37,900 --> 01:26:40,810
s xvii and wear of that machine for each

1872
01:26:40,810 --> 01:26:42,820
machine is generating a log and there

1873
01:26:42,820 --> 01:26:44,350
is logged when started and

1874
01:26:44,350 --> 01:26:47,429
when he stopped looking, it was seen that

1875
01:26:47,429 --> 01:26:51,250
coincides that the machine started ok in

1876
01:26:51,250 --> 01:26:53,110
dates in which there was brute force

1877
01:26:53,110 --> 01:26:56,139
to the web server with the ip of gallant that is

1878
01:26:56,139 --> 01:26:57,969
this machine had an ip were

1879
01:26:57,969 --> 01:27:00,159
shone against the lnd and the hcp

1880
01:27:00,159 --> 01:27:02,170
he gave an ip of the lnd and from there his

1881
01:27:02,170 --> 01:27:04,449
brute force afternoon minutes

1882
01:27:04,449 --> 01:27:06,369
then until the day after the

1883
01:27:06,369 --> 01:27:07,389
same lack why then why

1884
01:27:07,389 --> 01:27:09,159
probably the system administrator

1885
01:27:09,159 --> 01:27:10,780
he said so he changed his password

1886
01:27:10,780 --> 01:27:13,570
take eses

1887
01:27:13,570 --> 01:27:15,610
and well in this case it was very cool and

1888
01:27:15,610 --> 01:27:17,199
As a conclusion, I am only going to leave

1889
01:27:17,199 --> 01:27:19,710
this video

1890
01:27:26,230 --> 01:27:27,410
[Music]

1891
01:27:27,410 --> 01:27:31,500
there are men yes no

1892
01:27:34,650 --> 01:27:40,590
and well and he was not invincible in the end

1893
01:27:40,590 --> 01:27:42,690
man believed himself invincible because he had

1894
01:27:42,690 --> 01:27:44,100
made a difference because he was a great

1895
01:27:44,100 --> 01:27:46,560
hacker and really the truth is that

1896
01:27:46,560 --> 01:27:48,870
well the case was complicated

1897
01:27:48,870 --> 01:27:51,960
I admit, but in the end, well, in

1898
01:27:51,960 --> 01:27:54,239
pulling the thread and maybe we had a lot

1899
01:27:54,239 --> 01:27:56,429
good luck finding the net logo file

1900
01:27:56,429 --> 01:27:58,650
point the people who led us to the ones

1901
01:27:58,650 --> 01:28:01,170
It had to come to us and as I say in my

1902
01:28:01,170 --> 01:28:03,630
talk ends just tell you

1903
01:28:03,630 --> 01:28:05,719
to those of you who are in Spain

1904
01:28:05,719 --> 01:28:08,460
we have now occupy a hakim plan

1905
01:28:08,460 --> 01:28:09,320
ethical

1906
01:28:09,320 --> 01:28:11,909
face-to-face and online in real time only

1907
01:28:11,909 --> 01:28:13,320
Can it be done for people in Spain?

1908
01:28:13,320 --> 01:28:15,900
I'm sorry people and friends who are

1909
01:28:15,900 --> 01:28:17,489
in Latin America but for a matter of

1910
01:28:17,489 --> 01:28:18,960
streaming we can't do it any other way

1911
01:28:18,960 --> 01:28:21,630
way for there to be quality in what

1912
01:28:21,630 --> 01:28:24,810
in what we are offering are

1913
01:28:24,810 --> 01:28:27,300
formations that are given by daniel

1914
01:28:27,300 --> 01:28:29,060
echeverría drags that too

1915
01:28:29,060 --> 01:28:32,460
participate in this event and it is a plan of

1916
01:28:32,460 --> 01:28:34,590
ethical garden in which it is ethical

1917
01:28:34,590 --> 01:28:38,310
we try to teach how to do things

1918
01:28:38,310 --> 01:28:40,560
but also do not apply in cases

1919
01:28:40,560 --> 01:28:42,690
like the one I told you in the part

1920
01:28:42,690 --> 01:28:45,240
not bad but good because to help

1921
01:28:45,240 --> 01:28:47,220
identify faults that may have

1922
01:28:47,220 --> 01:28:49,230
your companies or others that

1923
01:28:49,230 --> 01:28:52,190
hire our hacking teams

1924
01:28:52,190 --> 01:28:54,300
and nothing more

1925
01:28:54,300 --> 01:28:56,520
up to here thanks a lot for everything

1926
01:28:56,520 --> 01:28:58,140
do you have my contact information if there is

1927
01:28:58,140 --> 01:28:59,850
questions that base the organization

1928
01:28:59,850 --> 01:29:04,160
quickly and if I don't answer them on twitter

1929
01:29:04,200 --> 01:29:05,790
to save thank you very much for your

1930
01:29:05,790 --> 01:29:07,200
participation is really very

1931
01:29:07,200 --> 01:29:10,500
interesting the chat the chat of this

1932
01:29:10,500 --> 01:29:12,030
game in fact they are saying that

1933
01:29:12,030 --> 01:29:15,889
we have another hour for

1934
01:29:16,070 --> 01:29:19,980
the outcome of the story is already

1935
01:29:19,980 --> 01:29:21,800
we saw it but who want more than

1936
01:29:21,800 --> 01:29:24,950
finishing version 10

1937
01:29:24,950 --> 01:29:27,500
next year

1938
01:29:27,500 --> 01:29:30,710
is that when it was a question no

1939
01:29:30,710 --> 01:29:33,270
there are many questions but there are some in

1940
01:29:33,270 --> 01:29:34,650
particular that they have many votes

1941
01:29:34,650 --> 01:29:36,870
So let's start with those and

1942
01:29:36,870 --> 01:29:40,530
Guillermo says in reference to the

1943
01:29:40,530 --> 01:29:42,420
first case it is not possible to have the

1944
01:29:42,420 --> 01:29:43,830
performance creation attributes

1945
01:29:43,830 --> 01:29:47,720
ntfs so that it is undetectable

1946
01:29:47,720 --> 01:29:50,510
that if it can be modified, man, have

1947
01:29:50,510 --> 01:29:52,880
can be modified is that here you have to

1948
01:29:52,880 --> 01:29:55,010
keep two things in mind the activity

1949
01:29:55,010 --> 01:29:58,130
natural is worth and the power to modify it

1950
01:29:58,130 --> 01:30:00,590
you can only modify the s and the

1951
01:30:00,590 --> 01:30:03,770
fn cannot be modified, it is worth the xxi

1952
01:30:03,770 --> 01:30:06,260
with a windows api call

1953
01:30:06,260 --> 01:30:09,710
accept you modify the one of that time of the

1954
01:30:09,710 --> 01:30:12,110
m time and modifies it without any problem

1955
01:30:12,110 --> 01:30:14,210
I mean, this can be done, okay, but I

1956
01:30:14,210 --> 01:30:15,590
what I do here is spend in the

1957
01:30:15,590 --> 01:30:17,720
natural behavior of something and if the

1958
01:30:17,720 --> 01:30:19,490
another expert is starting from one thing

1959
01:30:19,490 --> 01:30:21,050
well, that thing is starting from

1960
01:30:21,050 --> 01:30:24,430
you know that's the story

1961
01:30:24,430 --> 01:30:27,800
or through the operator tells us frame the

1962
01:30:27,800 --> 01:30:30,530
ordering in the stay in menu

1963
01:30:30,530 --> 01:30:34,340
windows server 2008 r2 how could

1964
01:30:34,340 --> 01:30:36,620
apply computer forensics after

1965
01:30:36,620 --> 01:30:39,780
that the service has been compromised

1966
01:30:39,780 --> 01:30:42,210
well you have to sit down and look at it

1967
01:30:42,210 --> 01:30:43,800
done if we are talking about

1968
01:30:43,800 --> 01:30:46,530
ns poisoning when you create one

1969
01:30:46,530 --> 01:30:50,400
entry of ns in a zone will generate a

1970
01:30:50,400 --> 01:30:52,860
series of files at the physical level once

1971
01:30:52,860 --> 01:30:55,949
more here who gives it to you in what it would be

1972
01:30:55,949 --> 01:30:59,039
the system artifacts

1973
01:30:59,039 --> 01:31:01,559
files the strong master and bag I

1974
01:31:01,559 --> 01:31:03,840
I insist I am always very heavy with this

1975
01:31:03,840 --> 01:31:08,190
the analysis of a file system is

1976
01:31:08,190 --> 01:31:10,619
there are many points of advantage to know

1977
01:31:10,619 --> 01:31:12,840
scan a file system well

1978
01:31:12,840 --> 01:31:15,989
ntfs the master fire table the love file and

1979
01:31:15,989 --> 01:31:19,320
the journal interpret well that is

1980
01:31:19,320 --> 01:31:22,380
wonderful, that is, it really contributes

1981
01:31:22,380 --> 01:31:24,719
a quantity of information for good or

1982
01:31:24,719 --> 01:31:27,090
for bad that allows you to understand what has

1983
01:31:27,090 --> 01:31:29,780
past is worth in many cases I go

1984
01:31:29,780 --> 01:31:33,389
we try very hard to try

1985
01:31:33,389 --> 01:31:35,670
explain this

1986
01:31:35,670 --> 01:31:37,690
we have many more questions but come on

1987
01:31:37,690 --> 01:31:39,159
with the last one that has more votes

1988
01:31:39,159 --> 01:31:42,850
comes from martir de argentina says which ones

1989
01:31:42,850 --> 01:31:44,500
These are the tools that you recommend the most.

1990
01:31:44,500 --> 01:31:46,300
for computer forensics and what it looks like

1991
01:31:46,300 --> 01:31:48,730
should never be overlooked

1992
01:31:48,730 --> 01:31:51,420
time to review an expert opinion

1993
01:31:51,420 --> 01:31:55,540
It is a very difficult question to answer

1994
01:31:55,540 --> 01:31:58,050
one in a minute but basically

1995
01:31:58,050 --> 01:32:01,120
tool that I consider important

1996
01:32:01,120 --> 01:32:02,949
for me I recommend you for the phase of

1997
01:32:02,949 --> 01:32:05,290
trias the acquisition of evidence

1998
01:32:05,290 --> 01:32:07,989
winter jacks is a tool that I have

1999
01:32:07,989 --> 01:32:10,870
made by me is free and I know that the

2000
01:32:10,870 --> 01:32:13,300
Do you know Jaime that we have talked about her?

2001
01:32:13,300 --> 01:32:16,380
on some occasion the same until used

2002
01:32:16,380 --> 01:32:18,389
and for analysis because there are many

2003
01:32:18,389 --> 01:32:20,940
In the end I used all the ones

2004
01:32:20,940 --> 01:32:23,100
almost one hundred percent are

2005
01:32:23,100 --> 01:32:26,820
free m that they give you to gut

2006
01:32:26,820 --> 01:32:30,510
a mcte ntfs what to be to gut

2007
01:32:30,510 --> 01:32:34,020
the logo and the journal interpret that and

2008
01:32:34,020 --> 01:32:37,620
reaper for example to identify for

2009
01:32:37,620 --> 01:32:40,560
get content run version of all

2010
01:32:40,560 --> 01:32:42,389
the different

2011
01:32:42,389 --> 01:32:46,199
record airs for 66 there are lots

2012
01:32:46,199 --> 01:32:48,420
from link to be one of fort discovery

2013
01:32:48,420 --> 01:32:52,560
to analyze files the nk ms svd

2014
01:32:52,560 --> 01:32:54,810
casts for the flames

2015
01:32:54,810 --> 01:32:59,840
and do a windows course

2016
01:33:04,969 --> 01:33:07,710
in the chat they are putting the networks

2017
01:33:07,710 --> 01:33:09,420
Lorenzo's social networks so that they can

2018
01:33:09,420 --> 01:33:11,550
ask the other questions and we

2019
01:33:11,550 --> 01:33:14,909
let's paste to paste in the internal chat

2021
01:33:16,199 --> 01:33:18,870
missing in case you can take the time

2022
01:33:18,870 --> 01:33:21,030
to respond in networks

2023
01:33:21,030 --> 01:33:23,670
would be generated by all and I answer them

2024
01:33:23,670 --> 01:33:25,220

2036
01:33:57,770 --> 01:34:00,380
a bit of how not to give papaya in

2037
01:34:00,380 --> 01:34:02,090
internet you have to do a little

2038
01:34:02,090 --> 01:34:03,800
explanation of what it is to give

2039
01:34:03,800 --> 01:34:05,480
papaya because it is a term like very

2040
01:34:05,480 --> 01:34:07,429
colloquial very Colombian but

2041
01:34:07,429 --> 01:34:10,640
It is practically like the prize that you

2042
01:34:10,640 --> 01:34:12,070
perform certain

2043
01:34:12,070 --> 01:34:14,210
malicious activities of cleanly

2044
01:34:14,210 --> 01:34:16,370

2045
01:34:16,370 --> 01:34:18,280

2060
01:35:11,910 --> 01:35:17,610

2061
01:35:18,080 --> 01:35:21,200

2071
01:35:43,040 --> 01:35:44,930
of this as of the previous editions

2072
01:35:44,930 --> 01:35:47,000
dragon hart security conference se

2073
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:50,000
they can do in dragon hard with point or

2074

heretic get into the archive section and

2075
01:35:53,270 --> 01:35:55,670
there is a platform where

2076
01:35:55,670 --> 01:35:57,110
allows you to see all the videos of the

2077
01:35:57,110 --> 01:35:59,540
past editions and they have to

2078
01:35:59,540 --> 01:36:01,220
visualize all as if they were one

2079
01:36:01,220 --> 01:36:03,530
class and at the end of that class they are going to

2080
01:36:03,530 --> 01:36:04,970
be able to generate the certificate

2081
01:36:04,970 --> 01:36:05,980
attendance

2082
01:36:05,980 --> 01:36:08,000
totally free of the different

2083
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:10,670
events since our last nine

2084
01:36:10,670 --> 01:36:11,390
editions

2085
01:36:11,390 --> 01:36:13,640
So Luis has already been able to share

2086
01:36:13,640 --> 01:36:15,230
screen let him through with the

2087
01:36:15,230 --> 01:36:17,420

2095
01:36:37,579 --> 01:36:40,219
very great to be able to participate in this

2096
01:36:40,219 --> 01:36:43,040
event I give lectures talks but

2097
01:36:43,040 --> 01:36:45,860
As my children used to say, this is another level.

2098
01:36:45,860 --> 01:36:47,719
I mean, these are the big leagues

2099
01:36:47,719 --> 01:36:50,929
So I'm very happy to be able to

2100
01:36:50,929 --> 01:36:53,150
speak and carry like this message of

2101
01:36:53,150 --> 01:36:56,449
reflection and if before beginning what

2102
01:36:56,449 --> 01:36:57,760
jaime said

2103
01:36:57,760 --> 01:37:00,380
the term papaya is a very

2104
01:37:00,380 --> 01:37:03,380
colloquial very colombia means that's how it is

2105
01:37:03,380 --> 01:37:06,739
how to expose how to risk how to give

2106
01:37:06,739 --> 01:37:08,929
chance of something happening

2107
01:37:08,929 --> 01:37:11,239
context of something human after

2108
01:37:11,239 --> 01:37:13,639
obviously we adapted it to cyber papaya

2109
01:37:13,639 --> 01:37:17,270
it means like in that digital environment

2110
01:37:17,270 --> 01:37:19,280
if we are exposing others and

2111
01:37:19,280 --> 01:37:23,030
we are over exposing information yes

2112
01:37:23,030 --> 01:37:25,280
we are screwing up that it is another

2113
01:37:25,280 --> 01:37:28,080
term that can be used here

2114
01:37:28,080 --> 01:37:34,210
and well, it's basically the topic, yes.

2115
01:37:34,210 --> 01:37:35,770
realize and know techniques not so

2116
01:37:35,770 --> 01:37:37,950
advanced to put the part of the network

2117
01:37:37,950 --> 01:37:41,560
It's like that if there's something I've wanted to say

2118
01:37:41,560 --> 01:37:43,690
I will always say it like this

2119
01:37:43,690 --> 01:37:46,990
talk about many the discrimination what

2120
01:37:46,990 --> 01:37:49,690
we are going to learn here it is educational for

2121
01:37:49,690 --> 01:37:52,270
please don't please don't

2122
01:37:52,270 --> 01:37:53,500
repeat

2123
01:37:53,500 --> 01:37:55,450
I know that all of us who have life

2124
01:37:55,450 --> 01:37:57,220
digital in one way or another we have

2125
01:37:57,220 --> 01:37:59,770
done we are doing it or we are going to

2126
01:37:59,770 --> 01:38:03,340
to do so is that they are all

2127
01:38:03,340 --> 01:38:05,650
guests are in the company if they are in

2128
01:38:05,650 --> 01:38:07,390
their home if they are in college yes

2129
01:38:07,390 --> 01:38:09,040
are those who are following this

2130
01:38:09,040 --> 01:38:11,230
call all the people because the

2131
01:38:11,230 --> 01:38:14,110
idea is that this charles for everything everything

2132
01:38:14,110 --> 01:38:16,780
have a digital life every day

2133
01:38:16,780 --> 01:38:18,280
people who in one way or another

2134
01:38:18,280 --> 01:38:20,410
we have precision internet living

2135
01:38:20,410 --> 01:38:22,780
days since we were little we are already getting into

2136
01:38:22,780 --> 01:38:25,480
the kids on the internet the grandparents to

2137
01:38:25,480 --> 01:38:27,700
As a result of the pandemic, many people have already

2138
01:38:27,700 --> 01:38:29,020
learned to handle many more

2139
01:38:29,020 --> 01:38:31,659
tools and the idea is that the

2140
01:38:31,659 --> 01:38:33,909
digital security as it is a matter of

2141
01:38:33,909 --> 01:38:35,860
everyone then calls in the company to

2142
01:38:35,860 --> 01:38:38,440
the people of services to the secretariat

2143
01:38:38,440 --> 01:38:42,010
to the manager and as we saw yesterday in some

2144
01:38:42,010 --> 01:38:44,650
Talk then and they also call someone who

2145
01:38:44,650 --> 01:38:46,750
another page director that you put the

2146
01:38:46,750 --> 01:38:48,960
escape something

2147
01:38:48,960 --> 01:38:53,350
then, well, let's start my name

2148
01:38:53,350 --> 01:38:56,560
is luis miguel angel zepeda

2149
01:38:56,560 --> 01:38:57,810
am

2150
01:38:57,810 --> 01:39:00,490
passionate about research

2151
01:39:00,490 --> 01:39:03,220
safety culture culture and

2152
01:39:03,220 --> 01:39:06,310
digital coexistence I have a degree in

2153
01:39:06,310 --> 01:39:08,320
electronics the pedagogical university of

2154
01:39:08,320 --> 01:39:10,030
Bogota Colombia

2155
01:39:10,030 --> 01:39:11,620
I live in zipaquirá I am transmitting to you

2156
01:39:11,620 --> 01:39:15,390
from zipaquira colombia

2157
01:39:15,390 --> 01:39:18,280
for 25 years passionate about everyone

2158
01:39:18,280 --> 01:39:21,100
these topics I have been a teacher is invited

2159
01:39:21,100 --> 01:39:23,170
as a speaker in multiple forums

2160
01:39:23,170 --> 01:39:26,140
I participate in media etc. and I am an author

2161
01:39:26,140 --> 01:39:28,150
of three books on this subject

2162
01:39:28,150 --> 01:39:30,730
digital security trying to bring the

2163
01:39:30,730 --> 01:39:33,250
message to the person on the street

2164
01:39:33,250 --> 01:39:36,310
common person to people who

2165
01:39:36,310 --> 01:39:38,350
Well, we talked to that one so that that one

2166
01:39:38,350 --> 01:39:40,450
famous phrase that technology me

2167
01:39:40,450 --> 01:39:43,300
run over and you can know we're in

2168
01:39:43,300 --> 01:39:45,640
full quarter of the 21st century and not

2169
01:39:45,640 --> 01:39:49,690
we can afford the luxury of being

2170
01:39:49,690 --> 01:39:53,350
thinking even of voting that ball there

2171
01:39:53,350 --> 01:39:55,150
are those responsible for our

2172
01:39:55,150 --> 01:39:57,910
security and our privacy then

2173
01:39:57,910 --> 01:40:00,220
how do they get that message across

2174
01:40:00,220 --> 01:40:02,250
to all

2175
01:40:02,250 --> 01:40:04,410
What do I propose for today's work?

2176
01:40:04,410 --> 01:40:07,590
there are three key moments the first is

2177
01:40:07,590 --> 01:40:10,200
of reflection let's see if it really

2178
01:40:10,200 --> 01:40:13,230
What I am saying is true if it is not

2179
01:40:13,230 --> 01:40:16,830
cart but two and it will be yes and when

2180
01:40:16,830 --> 01:40:18,900
something like that will be that yes yes it is all that

2181
01:40:18,900 --> 01:40:21,150
we are falling in that age matters

2182
01:40:21,150 --> 01:40:23,460
no matter the knowledge no matter if

2183
01:40:23,460 --> 01:40:25,440
I'm an expert, it doesn't matter, it concerns us

2184
01:40:25,440 --> 01:40:27,870
if we are going to reflect with some

2185
01:40:27,870 --> 01:40:29,850
images later we will

2186
01:40:29,850 --> 01:40:33,420
recognize is that knowledge that all

2187
01:40:33,420 --> 01:40:35,940
one way or another we have to see

2188
01:40:35,940 --> 01:40:37,800
how to talk start this is already part

2189
01:40:37,800 --> 01:40:39,560
digital culture

2190
01:40:39,560 --> 01:40:42,360
and in the end we are going to talk about action

2191
01:40:42,360 --> 01:40:44,820
What are we going to do or what have we already talked about?

2192
01:40:44,820 --> 01:40:46,770
a lot thing then what is it

2193
01:40:46,770 --> 01:40:49,320
I propose that any being

2194
01:40:49,320 --> 01:40:51,570
human who is against in life

2195
01:40:51,570 --> 01:40:54,760
digital can have a

2196
01:40:54,760 --> 01:40:57,849
healthy and safe coexistence in the network

2197
01:40:57,849 --> 01:41:01,030
So let's start with reflection

2198
01:41:01,030 --> 01:41:04,659
technology runs over me I said it and I

2199
01:41:04,659 --> 01:41:06,550
all my colleagues will excuse me here

2200
01:41:06,550 --> 01:41:09,969
experts who have passed in this first

2201
01:41:09,969 --> 01:41:11,979
day because it starts not at all

2202
01:41:11,979 --> 01:41:14,469
people who are connected who know

2203
01:41:14,469 --> 01:41:17,199
that this definition is very clear but

2204
01:41:17,199 --> 01:41:19,689
for many people on a day-to-day basis

2205
01:41:19,689 --> 01:41:22,510
common this is what happens

2206
01:41:22,510 --> 01:41:24,129
we carry the message in safety

2207
01:41:24,129 --> 01:41:27,399
digital at such high levels that

2208
01:41:27,399 --> 01:41:30,489
are servile to those of us who follow

2209
01:41:30,489 --> 01:41:33,249
many speakers that we see there are some

2210
01:41:33,249 --> 01:41:35,469
textbooks is tera but for the

2211
01:41:35,469 --> 01:41:38,050
ordinary person faces this

2212
01:41:38,050 --> 01:41:40,510
something is that this is the complex was not

2213
01:41:40,510 --> 01:41:41,699
TRUE

2214
01:41:41,699 --> 01:41:45,309
So I propose to change that face

2215
01:41:45,309 --> 01:41:47,769
that he is on this other side a bit

2216
01:41:47,769 --> 01:41:49,450
more friendly

2217
01:41:49,450 --> 01:41:51,850
and understand this message safety

2218
01:41:51,850 --> 01:41:53,440
digital that I think can reach us

2219
01:41:53,440 --> 01:41:55,390
everyone to digital security is action

2220
01:41:55,390 --> 01:41:58,450
that we are going to do this to prevent

2221
01:41:58,450 --> 01:42:00,550
serve those words that are in

2222
01:42:00,550 --> 01:42:03,250
capital letters do not forget what actions we are going

2223
01:42:03,250 --> 01:42:05,920
to do to prevent is the risk that

2224
01:42:05,920 --> 01:42:08,140
exists against the various threats in

2225
01:42:08,140 --> 01:42:11,470
the network because there are threats that maybe

2226
01:42:11,470 --> 01:42:13,420
we can't share but we can

2227
01:42:13,420 --> 01:42:16,060
minimize the risk and it is something that I

2228
01:42:16,060 --> 01:42:17,670
I try about it

2229
01:42:17,670 --> 01:42:21,460
So that's what we're talking about

2230
01:42:21,460 --> 01:42:24,220
of the human being the human being is key

2231
01:42:24,220 --> 01:42:26,740
then being the one who ultimately has

2232
01:42:26,740 --> 01:42:28,390
to take that action so let's talk about

2233
01:42:28,390 --> 01:42:31,390
technology so I work in 'the and so

2234
01:42:31,390 --> 01:42:33,850
I have my WhatsApp as configured

2235
01:42:33,850 --> 01:42:36,730
to make it more secure as you set

2236
01:42:36,730 --> 01:42:40,120
this team so that things don't happen

2237
01:42:40,120 --> 01:42:43,120
So as human beings we have a

2238
01:42:43,120 --> 01:42:45,670
important paper with strata little words

2239
01:42:45,670 --> 01:42:47,770
judgments and decisions

2240
01:42:47,770 --> 01:42:50,470
and that's basically I'll think about it

2241
01:42:50,470 --> 01:42:52,560
day by day each one of us

2242
01:42:52,560 --> 01:42:54,520
regardless of what we do in the

2243
01:42:54,520 --> 01:42:56,440
digital life and the logic of changing

2244
01:42:56,440 --> 01:43:00,490
all are based on judgments and decisions and

2245
01:43:00,490 --> 01:43:02,080
This has a lot to do with engineering.

2246
01:43:02,080 --> 01:43:05,170
social how are we going to see what what

2247
01:43:05,170 --> 01:43:07,420
judgments and what decisions we are making

2248
01:43:07,420 --> 01:43:09,670
It will be that if we are screwing up

2249
01:43:09,670 --> 01:43:11,680
You will see that if we are giving ourselves papaya

2250
01:43:11,680 --> 01:43:14,110
Well, let's start by looking at these images.

2251
01:43:14,110 --> 01:43:16,420
please the people who are there in the chat

2252
01:43:16,420 --> 01:43:18,730
I'm not in let others than me

2253
01:43:18,730 --> 01:43:20,130
I know that there are already several that I will be there

2254
01:43:20,130 --> 01:43:23,740
let's hope it's more entertaining

2255
01:43:23,740 --> 01:43:25,960
the exercise but let's look at these

2256
01:43:25,960 --> 01:43:27,970
publications in a normal day-to-day

2257
01:43:27,970 --> 01:43:30,400
anyone has a portal hand

2258
01:43:30,400 --> 01:43:32,740
that we want it in the networks we see here

2259
01:43:32,740 --> 01:43:35,110
a photo of the boy if arthritis is

2260
01:43:35,110 --> 01:43:37,150
important to highlight national talent

2261
01:43:37,150 --> 01:43:39,940
So that there are no leaks, true in Mexico

2262
01:43:39,940 --> 01:43:42,400
and it appears that she is an expert in physics

2263
01:43:42,400 --> 01:43:45,100
quantum this boy turns out to be in

2264
01:43:45,100 --> 01:43:46,260
another post

2265
01:43:46,260 --> 01:43:50,660
there is also the boy for a battery

2266
01:43:50,660 --> 01:43:53,330
more because he died he is looking for the

2267
01:43:53,330 --> 01:43:55,790
fight him as in rest the pass

2268
01:43:55,790 --> 01:43:59,330
of Spain and the famous phrases of

2269
01:43:59,330 --> 01:44:01,850
social engineering with those who seek

2270
01:44:01,850 --> 01:44:03,890
hook people as it is not

2271
01:44:03,890 --> 01:44:06,050
footballer or singer then everything

2272
01:44:06,050 --> 01:44:08,570
We go out and if we have to support why not

2273
01:44:08,570 --> 01:44:10,700
go player because you do not give to christ that

2274
01:44:10,700 --> 01:44:11,780
in the shield of the because of the

2275
01:44:11,780 --> 01:44:13,280
footballer between let's share share

2276
01:44:13,280 --> 01:44:16,040
contributing the likes etc we see it there

2277
01:44:16,040 --> 01:44:19,940
how many times has it been shared on and from

2278
01:44:19,940 --> 01:44:22,430
teacher and oh surprise we see the same

2279
01:44:22,430 --> 01:44:25,660
boy who is now

2280
01:44:25,660 --> 01:44:28,100
harvard is in ecuador because the degree

2281
01:44:28,100 --> 01:44:32,450
hardware is mathematical indeed since

2282
01:44:32,450 --> 01:44:35,240
is always multifaceted and the most

2283
01:44:35,240 --> 01:44:37,400
recent here in colombia we have the

2284
01:44:37,400 --> 01:44:40,010
gem is that it turns out that nothing more or

2285
01:44:40,010 --> 01:44:42,920
nothing less than I hope is familiar to you

2286
01:44:42,920 --> 01:44:45,170
some former president and with the problem of

2287
01:44:45,170 --> 01:44:47,570
the register there is the detail as

2288
01:44:47,570 --> 01:44:49,910
I would say cantinflas and then the fraud and

2289
01:44:49,910 --> 01:44:51,620
let's attack and like so not in

2290
01:44:51,620 --> 01:44:54,230
let's share decent etc

2291
01:44:54,230 --> 01:44:58,130
Well, we'll see the mystery and now

2292
01:44:58,130 --> 01:45:01,630
everyone will know there because that famous physicist

2293
01:45:01,630 --> 01:45:04,940
relative of a former president person who

2294
01:45:04,940 --> 01:45:06,560
He has passed away because he is an actor

2295
01:45:06,560 --> 01:45:09,370
spanish porn movies

2296
01:45:09,370 --> 01:45:12,650
and we already share

2297
01:45:12,650 --> 01:45:15,230
we made a judgment based on that noise

2298
01:45:15,230 --> 01:45:18,110
that is managed and that intervenes a lot in

2299
01:45:18,110 --> 01:45:20,750
my social life and that can be used

2300
01:45:20,750 --> 01:45:23,180
to socially destabilize

2301
01:45:23,180 --> 01:45:25,010
congest networks unnecessarily

2302
01:45:25,010 --> 01:45:28,370
even to outline because well with

2303
01:45:28,370 --> 01:45:29,810
all those comments that go

2304
01:45:29,810 --> 01:45:31,880
becoming someone the networks because why not

2305
01:45:31,880 --> 01:45:34,580
go doing some things we no longer have

2306
01:45:34,580 --> 01:45:37,010
of course those two girls are not from the

2307
01:45:37,010 --> 01:45:38,930
registrar nor are they the companions of

2308
01:45:38,930 --> 01:45:41,840
harvard let's move on to the next see in

2309
01:45:41,840 --> 01:45:44,300
this moment another photo of another character

2310
01:45:44,300 --> 01:45:45,910
Do not say anything

2311
01:45:45,910 --> 01:45:49,160
We see that a student is called alias and that

2312
01:45:49,160 --> 01:45:50,960
they can love and numbers than the one who put

2313
01:45:50,960 --> 01:45:52,910
here the bomb a few years ago in the

2314
01:45:52,910 --> 01:45:54,190
police school

2315
01:45:54,190 --> 01:45:56,690
terrible terrorist let's share why

2316
01:45:56,690 --> 01:45:59,940
we can't leave that and punish

2317
01:45:59,940 --> 01:46:02,560
here I also did and it turns out that the same

2318
01:46:02,560 --> 01:46:05,410
It's international lit the cathedral of

2319
01:46:05,410 --> 01:46:06,610
notre dame

2320
01:46:06,610 --> 01:46:08,590
no no it can't be let's share it in

2321
01:46:08,590 --> 01:46:12,160
comments etcetera and in the latter the

2322
01:46:12,160 --> 01:46:14,710
I kidnap these girls that if someone already

2323
01:46:14,710 --> 01:46:17,080
saw matica will understand that these are the

2324
01:46:17,080 --> 01:46:19,960
matilda's girls but we don't see why

2325
01:46:19,960 --> 01:46:22,570
because even though the world moves

2326
01:46:22,570 --> 01:46:25,030
with the attention economy

2327
01:46:25,030 --> 01:46:28,270
pay attention true the idea is

2328
01:46:28,270 --> 01:46:32,080
take the person to move that

2329
01:46:32,080 --> 01:46:34,960
human being move it an amount

2330
01:46:34,960 --> 01:46:37,719
feelings emotions to make a

2331
01:46:37,719 --> 01:46:39,670
judgment and make a decision

2332
01:46:39,670 --> 01:46:42,370
share etc. for example this from

2333
01:46:42,370 --> 01:46:45,910
girls lost boys are shared se

2334
01:46:45,910 --> 01:46:48,429
share many messages of this child

2335
01:46:48,429 --> 01:46:51,160
they are lost please and they are children who

2336
01:46:51,160 --> 01:46:53,050
have been lost for ten years and still

2337
01:46:53,050 --> 01:46:56,050
They are still lost and they keep looking, it is more

2338
01:46:56,050 --> 01:46:58,420
and there are many who have already found them but

2339
01:46:58,420 --> 01:47:01,480
so how do you manage these on the one hand

2340
01:47:01,480 --> 01:47:03,370
the famous grenades of likes by another

2341
01:47:03,370 --> 01:47:05,590
side can be profiled or on the other side

2342
01:47:05,590 --> 01:47:07,180
then you can get a message to

2343
01:47:07,180 --> 01:47:09,120
these children who have been lost

2344
01:47:09,120 --> 01:47:11,560
telling them that it does not appear is a

2345
01:47:11,560 --> 01:47:13,840
very poor family the police do not do al

2346
01:47:13,840 --> 01:47:16,300
government does not help but we create

2347
01:47:16,300 --> 01:47:18,670
an account to support this family there is

2348
01:47:18,670 --> 01:47:21,550
it's there you can make your payments it's like

2349
01:47:21,550 --> 01:47:23,710
we realize this has some

2350
01:47:23,710 --> 01:47:27,280
connotations a little more more more

2351
01:47:27,280 --> 01:47:29,739
Beyond what it seems, well, I think

2352
01:47:29,739 --> 01:47:31,540
that they will have already seen a lot who will know

2353
01:47:31,540 --> 01:47:34,150
who who we are we talk we are u2

2354
01:47:34,150 --> 01:47:37,750
of the euro play that in case those

2355
01:47:37,750 --> 01:47:39,880
messages make fun of everything on his channel

2356
01:47:39,880 --> 01:47:41,140
What have I done here that there is another amount

2357
01:47:41,140 --> 01:47:44,170
of things not and coronavirus with senators

2358
01:47:44,170 --> 01:47:45,760
and senators who have said the number of

2359
01:47:45,760 --> 01:47:48,489
things and he makes fun of this but let's think

2360
01:47:48,489 --> 01:47:50,950
also in something like the famous

2361
01:47:50,950 --> 01:47:54,670
digital reputation term he is a

2362
01:47:54,670 --> 01:47:56,470
famous person has created an identity

2363
01:47:56,470 --> 01:48:00,130
digital with which you can share and

2364
01:48:00,130 --> 01:48:02,080
take advantage of that but what if those

2365
01:48:02,080 --> 01:48:03,730
same messages that were a while ago

2366
01:48:03,730 --> 01:48:06,980
moment out for any of us

2367
01:48:06,980 --> 01:48:08,810
for the internal we are barely average

2368
01:48:08,810 --> 01:48:12,020
known how it affects our lives

2369
01:48:12,020 --> 01:48:15,170
if we have not created a good identity and

2370
01:48:15,170 --> 01:48:16,790
That's where I'm going with the topic of the

2371
01:48:16,790 --> 01:48:19,900
coexistence what do I do in the networks yes

2372
01:48:19,900 --> 01:48:22,670
you have to start paying attention to

2373
01:48:22,670 --> 01:48:24,500
all the little things we're seeing

2374
01:48:24,500 --> 01:48:27,350
to reflect but it is not only that

2375
01:48:27,350 --> 01:48:30,680
Let's look at this other message, not free

2376
01:48:30,680 --> 01:48:34,220
I won the lottery and well many

2377
01:48:34,220 --> 01:48:36,320
know this famous message that came to

2378
01:48:36,320 --> 01:48:38,120
cell phones and there are people who have told me

2379
01:48:38,120 --> 01:48:40,430
Said is that I use the cell phone flechita

2380
01:48:40,430 --> 01:48:43,130
because these smartphones these teams

2381
01:48:43,130 --> 01:48:45,080
these are the internet that many arrive

2382
01:48:45,080 --> 01:48:47,540
things I feel I use a little arrow better and

2383
01:48:47,540 --> 01:48:49,130
it turns out that the little arrows that arrive

2384
01:48:49,130 --> 01:48:51,650
texting and how i think he is

2385
01:48:51,650 --> 01:48:54,650
being clear in the talk is not itself

2386
01:48:54,650 --> 01:48:57,260
technology is relative easier is

2387
01:48:57,260 --> 01:48:59,060
relatively easy you want it to be

2388
01:48:59,060 --> 01:49:02,360
human convincing that person in

2389
01:49:02,360 --> 01:49:04,460
special to a group of people

2390
01:49:04,460 --> 01:49:07,280
specials of a certain cetera in a

2391
01:49:07,280 --> 01:49:08,989
exposure is sent a text message

2392
01:49:08,989 --> 01:49:11,900
where do they say you won this prize car

2393
01:49:11,900 --> 01:49:14,690
silver calls already calling one of those

2394
01:49:14,690 --> 01:49:17,390
numbers as most know sounds

2395
01:49:17,390 --> 01:49:19,580
fanfare little special music

2396
01:49:19,580 --> 01:49:21,980
We congratulate and adherence and applause

2397
01:49:21,980 --> 01:49:24,680
they create the whole atmosphere

2398
01:49:24,680 --> 01:49:28,760
of confidence or those words and then nothing

2399
01:49:28,760 --> 01:49:30,980
He says ready, have the pesos but

2400
01:49:30,980 --> 01:49:33,800
we need to verify as a reload to

2401
01:49:33,800 --> 01:49:36,680
this number and as we have already discussed

2402
01:49:36,680 --> 01:49:39,680
even in chats and people have

2403
01:49:39,680 --> 01:49:42,350
Where are those refills going?

2404
01:49:42,350 --> 01:49:44,510
prisons and that serves so that

2405
01:49:44,510 --> 01:49:46,820
then a lot of whiskey is being made

2406
01:49:46,820 --> 01:49:49,730
that I had discussed it yesterday with him

2407
01:49:49,730 --> 01:49:52,400
that the little call the uncle spoke to me

2408
01:49:52,400 --> 01:49:53,780
who is sick and who is not

2409
01:49:53,780 --> 01:49:55,850
ran over who meditated money well everything

2410
01:49:55,850 --> 01:49:57,680
this comes out in prisons but we are

2411
01:49:57,680 --> 01:49:59,920
Sponsoring those cell phone refills

2412
01:49:59,920 --> 01:50:02,870
Obviously, it is talk that has been

2413
01:50:02,870 --> 01:50:06,290
lost and people say oops it's not me

2414
01:50:06,290 --> 01:50:08,150
they hacked the password and one that

2415
01:50:08,150 --> 01:50:09,680
makes me think about my hacked

2416
01:50:09,680 --> 01:50:12,770
password specialized software that

2417
01:50:12,770 --> 01:50:16,470
here all the but if the people who

2418
01:50:16,470 --> 01:50:19,020
they have spoken to many know many

2419
01:50:19,020 --> 01:50:21,120
of these other tools and how to do

2420
01:50:21,120 --> 01:50:23,370
edited this kind of stuff but the

2421
01:50:23,370 --> 01:50:25,800
ordinary people stay in space

2422
01:50:25,800 --> 01:50:27,480
It doesn't happen to me that's very movie

2423
01:50:27,480 --> 01:50:29,420
fresh hollywood no problem

2424
01:50:29,420 --> 01:50:33,720
let's look at this image this is from hawaii la

2425
01:50:33,720 --> 01:50:36,240
agency is in green emergencies

2426
01:50:36,240 --> 01:50:39,420
famous photo with the post-it with the super

2427
01:50:39,420 --> 01:50:40,980
password because what is it for

2428
01:50:40,980 --> 01:50:43,770
very robust password but it stayed at

2429
01:50:43,770 --> 01:50:47,730
discovered come and that does not happen only there and

2430
01:50:47,730 --> 01:50:51,000
that's supposedly this time it was a

2431
01:50:51,000 --> 01:50:54,240
news that is to this agency launched a

2432
01:50:54,240 --> 01:50:56,880
message to all hawaii to get active and

2433
01:50:56,880 --> 01:50:59,420
a missile on the way and a collective panic

2434
01:50:59,420 --> 01:51:02,250
and then this person had to go out

2435
01:51:02,250 --> 01:51:04,320
yes it was not yes octopus press the button no

2436
01:51:04,320 --> 01:51:07,000
it was but the matter goes further

2437
01:51:07,000 --> 01:51:08,630
password

2438
01:51:08,630 --> 01:51:09,760
[Music]

2439
01:51:09,760 --> 01:51:12,760
and if you are turned by a company

2440
01:51:12,760 --> 01:51:14,530
you will find many teams like this

2441
01:51:14,530 --> 01:51:16,420
so why put password in

2442
01:51:16,420 --> 01:51:19,240
last and they will have it there to the mark

2443
01:51:19,240 --> 01:51:21,310
more complex assets of that password

2444
01:51:21,310 --> 01:51:23,950
can be used for many and many

2445
01:51:23,950 --> 01:51:25,720
services of many applications because

2446
01:51:25,720 --> 01:51:27,300
we are lazy to do more cons is

2447
01:51:27,300 --> 01:51:29,450
certain

2448
01:51:29,450 --> 01:51:32,060
I found this other one out there I hope

2449
01:51:32,060 --> 01:51:34,270
that is false true

2450
01:51:34,270 --> 01:51:37,070
He talks about I have a card and what

2451
01:51:37,070 --> 01:51:38,630
chicanear in networks because it is the

2452
01:51:38,630 --> 01:51:40,640
modality in díaz will bet who we are

2453
01:51:40,640 --> 01:51:43,610
and then there appears the back number

2454
01:51:43,610 --> 01:51:45,620
because everyone asks me

2455
01:51:45,620 --> 01:51:47,440
back number

2456
01:51:47,440 --> 01:51:50,730
true and then we have the audacity

2457
01:51:50,730 --> 01:51:53,969
because it is like that to say they hacked me

2458
01:51:53,969 --> 01:51:57,160
true they hacked me when we don't give each other

2459
01:51:57,160 --> 01:51:59,790
note that we are hacking ourselves

2460
01:51:59,790 --> 01:52:03,630
we give a lot of continued in papaya

2461
01:52:03,630 --> 01:52:06,060
the same as what I was talking about a moment ago

2462
01:52:06,060 --> 01:52:09,150
from euroempleo he is a well-known character

2463
01:52:09,150 --> 01:52:11,550
but what happens when there is a message that

2464
01:52:11,550 --> 01:52:15,420
Mass becomes mass and we turn it

2465
01:52:15,420 --> 01:52:18,690
we believe because it is san whatsapp san

2466
01:52:18,690 --> 01:52:21,929
facebook and what is said is true and

2467
01:52:21,929 --> 01:52:24,150
it can happen these cases as

2468
01:52:24,150 --> 01:52:27,480
as so serious but it is understandable we are

2469
01:52:27,480 --> 01:52:29,670
human beings have our

2470
01:52:29,670 --> 01:52:31,639
vulnerabilities our shortcomings

2471
01:52:31,639 --> 01:52:34,409
evolutionarily we are like that

2472
01:52:34,409 --> 01:52:37,050
but they have also sold us some

2473
01:52:37,050 --> 01:52:39,389
ideas that is what I expose too

2474
01:52:39,389 --> 01:52:41,790
in my talk with those who sometimes don't

2475
01:52:41,790 --> 01:52:44,730
we can stray us down the road we

2476
01:52:44,730 --> 01:52:46,320
lead to the dark side where not

2477
01:52:46,320 --> 01:52:49,290
we should be the first of those are

2478
01:52:49,290 --> 01:52:51,000
four that I like to talk about

2479
01:52:51,000 --> 01:52:53,520
first time we thought that technology

2480
01:52:53,520 --> 01:52:57,090
it is and it will be and it will solve everything and we

2481
01:52:57,090 --> 01:52:59,750
we disconnect as human beings

2482
01:52:59,750 --> 01:53:01,760
true what he said now then

2483
01:53:01,760 --> 01:53:04,100
we believe in something because it simply is

2484
01:53:04,100 --> 01:53:06,650
on the internet and we think what is there

2485
01:53:06,650 --> 01:53:09,040
it's true true

2486
01:53:09,040 --> 01:53:12,260
we trust one hundred percent in a tweet

2487
01:53:12,260 --> 01:53:14,990
of safety and we wash our hands and

2488
01:53:14,990 --> 01:53:17,840
we forget about the rest if we don't

2489
01:53:17,840 --> 01:53:20,030
We realize that we have to balance the

2490
01:53:20,030 --> 01:53:23,600
technology helps us is true a long time ago

2491
01:53:23,600 --> 01:53:25,970
time a lecturer an I don't know what

2492
01:53:25,970 --> 01:53:29,630
country was said that famous phrase of the

2493
01:53:29,630 --> 01:53:32,810
power of technology not technology

2494
01:53:32,810 --> 01:53:34,760
if you don't have powers in some other

2495
01:53:34,760 --> 01:53:38,110
but when we are like zombies there is

2496
01:53:38,110 --> 01:53:41,090
connected by clicking 11 at night

2497
01:53:41,090 --> 01:53:44,540
midnight sharing doing we put

2498
01:53:44,540 --> 01:53:46,400
the back uses them we go down because

2499
01:53:46,400 --> 01:53:48,260
Well, the brain is going to the factory, no.

2500
01:53:48,260 --> 01:53:51,200
works like this then it's time to take

2501
01:53:51,200 --> 01:53:53,960
control and be the ones

2502
01:53:53,960 --> 01:53:56,960
we decide how our life

2503
01:53:56,960 --> 01:53:59,240
technology is going to help us and what

2504
01:53:59,240 --> 01:54:00,690
controls

2505
01:54:00,690 --> 01:54:03,090
the second a security incident

2506
01:54:03,090 --> 01:54:05,219
it only affects me nothing happens to me

2507
01:54:05,219 --> 01:54:07,140
They hacked and emailed but I'm a book

2508
01:54:07,140 --> 01:54:10,020
open no problem investigate

2509
01:54:10,020 --> 01:54:12,000
what they want then that's just for

2510
01:54:12,000 --> 01:54:14,850
me but we do not realize that it runs the

2511
01:54:14,850 --> 01:54:16,469
looted for impersonation

2512
01:54:16,469 --> 01:54:19,140
indian sometimes people don't fall for

2513
01:54:19,140 --> 01:54:22,260
account is to use the name to imagine

2514
01:54:22,260 --> 01:54:24,480
send emails to boss to friends

2515
01:54:24,480 --> 01:54:26,500
seeing money etc

2516
01:54:26,500 --> 01:54:28,150
the day besides that sometimes they are the

2517
01:54:28,150 --> 01:54:30,280
emails that are linked to the accounts

2518
01:54:30,280 --> 01:54:33,130
principals of various services as a

2519
01:54:33,130 --> 01:54:35,290
incident does not only affect me we have

2520
01:54:35,290 --> 01:54:38,320
to understand that with me there is a family

2521
01:54:38,320 --> 01:54:41,920
and since 2020 we realized the

2522
01:54:41,920 --> 01:54:46,060
pandemic and isolation that in the

2523
01:54:46,060 --> 01:54:48,100
home, many things were no longer focused

2524
01:54:48,100 --> 01:54:50,740
can one run to pei to ask for help

2525
01:54:50,740 --> 01:54:52,750
to a student to the professor systems no

2526
01:54:52,750 --> 01:54:54,850
everything was fine the place and everyone

2527
01:54:54,850 --> 01:54:57,520
we had to be of you to share that

2528
01:54:57,520 --> 01:54:59,890
make video calls than birthday

2529
01:54:59,890 --> 01:55:02,710
than games in entertainment everything

2530
01:55:02,710 --> 01:55:05,110
focused on the home therefore neither

2531
01:55:05,110 --> 01:55:06,940
following can begin to affect that

2532
01:55:06,940 --> 01:55:10,890
first environment children grandparents family

2533
01:55:10,890 --> 01:55:15,040
wife headquarters but precisely what

2534
01:55:15,040 --> 01:55:17,980
spoke as a result of that isolation as

2535
01:55:17,980 --> 01:55:20,890
now hybrid work or is it still

2536
01:55:20,890 --> 01:55:23,950
work home etc. well the companies

2537
01:55:23,950 --> 01:55:27,280
also commits is a fact and more

2538
01:55:27,280 --> 01:55:30,100
if I am lending my my equipment if he

2539
01:55:30,100 --> 01:55:32,710
equipment that I use I lend it to my son

2540
01:55:32,710 --> 01:55:34,840
He gave him to enter pelis plus

2541
01:55:34,840 --> 01:55:38,260
torrents install some tournament if it is the

2542
01:55:38,260 --> 01:55:39,880
fresh company team that is the most

2543
01:55:39,880 --> 01:55:42,250
fast all we're risking

2544
01:55:42,250 --> 01:55:45,430
without realizing if then I am not

2545
01:55:45,430 --> 01:55:47,650
only i am affecting my first

2546
01:55:47,650 --> 01:55:51,370
home environment business environment my

2547
01:55:51,370 --> 01:55:55,180
next level security can be given and

2548
01:55:55,180 --> 01:55:57,580
on a social level if it is something serious that

2549
01:55:57,580 --> 01:55:59,800
affect the reputation of the company

2550
01:55:59,800 --> 01:56:03,150
affect the reputation of the household

2551
01:56:03,150 --> 01:56:06,430
personally to friends then a

2552
01:56:06,430 --> 01:56:08,680
security incident not only affects you

2553
01:56:08,680 --> 01:56:11,400
you carry many people

2554
01:56:11,400 --> 01:56:14,770
third in the network everything is virtual to see

2555
01:56:14,770 --> 01:56:19,190
is beyond in a pun

2556
01:56:19,190 --> 01:56:21,680
something that I have proposed in my talk yes

2557
01:56:21,680 --> 01:56:23,570
the virtual little word was put in guaymas

2558
01:56:23,570 --> 01:56:28,520
now yes but to see virtual the brain

2559
01:56:28,520 --> 01:56:32,300
this processes it in a way outside the

2560
01:56:32,300 --> 01:56:35,090
Words have that power and virtual the

2561
01:56:35,090 --> 01:56:37,850
brain does not understand as not real if it is

2562
01:56:37,850 --> 01:56:39,770
plus the royal academy in its third

2563
01:56:39,770 --> 01:56:42,020
meaning says virtual not real

2564
01:56:42,020 --> 01:56:44,449
fourth that is below refers to all

2565
01:56:44,449 --> 01:56:46,910
digital media and see it but

2566
01:56:46,910 --> 01:56:48,530
So when you've seen it before

2567
01:56:48,530 --> 01:56:50,480
without a brain I made this more real and that's why

2568
01:56:50,480 --> 01:56:52,580
things happen on the internet is that it is

2569
01:56:52,580 --> 01:56:54,410
seen write as you can do and

2570
01:56:54,410 --> 01:56:55,940
undo and nothing happens development and

2571
01:56:55,940 --> 01:56:58,940
killed nobody nothing nobody will catch me in

2572
01:56:58,940 --> 01:57:00,380
Navarre, but as we saw in the

2573
01:57:00,380 --> 01:57:02,960
previous talk is not like that

2574
01:57:02,960 --> 01:57:05,780
2 my proposal is to change that for the

2575
01:57:05,780 --> 01:57:08,360
virtual life for digital true or not

2576
01:57:08,360 --> 01:57:11,719
face-to-face and let's talk about a real world

2577
01:57:11,719 --> 01:57:13,790
which is both digital and

2578
01:57:13,790 --> 01:57:16,310
digital if to me in the day to day I go for

2579
01:57:16,310 --> 01:57:18,290
They rob me on the street and they don't go, I don't

2580
01:57:18,290 --> 01:57:20,760
I want 300 thousand pesos

2581
01:57:20,760 --> 01:57:23,429
And if I go to Facebook and it turns out that a guy

2582
01:57:23,429 --> 01:57:25,469
He arrived from Europe and he is asking me for 300

2583
01:57:25,469 --> 01:57:27,360
thousand pesos to remove merchandise from

2584
01:57:27,360 --> 01:57:30,449
customs because they are 300 thousand real pesos

2585
01:57:30,449 --> 01:57:33,710
two virtual ones are that you spend implan

2586
01:57:33,710 --> 01:57:36,780
then the real world the real thing

2587
01:57:36,780 --> 01:57:39,239
composed of its two environments and between

2588
01:57:39,239 --> 01:57:41,280
discussions with experts who talks looks

2589
01:57:41,280 --> 01:57:43,409
disconnect from the internet to be able

2590
01:57:43,409 --> 01:57:45,090
live in real life

2591
01:57:45,090 --> 01:57:48,090
the internet was not daily and real

2592
01:57:48,090 --> 01:57:52,289
ready then this is a proposal

2593
01:57:52,289 --> 01:57:55,139
that we begin to understand that beyond

2594
01:57:55,139 --> 01:57:57,659
engage in philosophical debates about the

2595
01:57:57,659 --> 01:58:00,030
virtuality is understanding what is real and what

2596
01:58:00,030 --> 01:58:01,829
what happens on the internet they do to all of us

2597
01:58:01,829 --> 01:58:04,810
in a real way

2598
01:58:04,810 --> 01:58:07,210
and finally in this part we are not

2599
01:58:07,210 --> 01:58:09,030
important for cybercriminals

2600
01:58:09,030 --> 01:58:11,950
Well, managers don't miss that

2601
01:58:11,950 --> 01:58:15,700
that happens to me health has a sign already

2602
01:58:15,700 --> 01:58:18,340
we have seen in previous talks there are

2603
01:58:18,340 --> 01:58:21,010
organized groups in the first place there

2604
01:58:21,010 --> 01:58:23,500
groups organized worldwide

2605
01:58:23,500 --> 01:58:26,230
they look every day to see that those fit

2606
01:58:26,230 --> 01:58:28,720
famous mail theft messages from

2607
01:58:28,720 --> 01:58:31,600
desire that they turn on servera but many

2608
01:58:31,600 --> 01:58:33,820
people sometimes stay on that plan

2609
01:58:33,820 --> 01:58:36,460
He quoted that not only that is where it happens

2610
01:58:36,460 --> 01:58:38,590
in other countries russia finland china

2611
01:58:38,590 --> 01:58:40,870
Brazil, that is, here that does not reach us

2612
01:58:40,870 --> 01:58:42,610
dissect like in bollywood movie

2613
01:58:42,610 --> 01:58:45,820
and they forget that to read is not to be

2614
01:58:45,820 --> 01:58:48,820
organized crime as it is a

2615
01:58:48,820 --> 01:58:51,580
cybercriminal closer than it seems

2616
01:58:51,580 --> 01:58:54,610
I don't know if you saw that that movie about this

2617
01:58:54,610 --> 01:58:57,760
actor is called from my heaven it turns out

2618
01:58:57,760 --> 01:58:59,920
who was the friendly neighbor who wasn't

2619
01:58:59,920 --> 01:59:01,540
so friendly

2620
01:59:01,540 --> 01:59:03,700
does not mean please avoid

2621
01:59:03,700 --> 01:59:05,680
go out to fight with the lost but

2622
01:59:05,680 --> 01:59:08,940
sometimes we are too confident

2623
01:59:08,940 --> 01:59:11,440
we lend our equipment at the right hand and

2624
01:59:11,440 --> 01:59:12,000
sinister

2625
01:59:12,000 --> 01:59:14,650
we use the neighbor's equipment the neighbor

2626
01:59:14,650 --> 01:59:16,300
to do Chinese homework

2627
01:59:16,300 --> 01:59:19,600
girl and we don't realize it so much

2628
01:59:19,600 --> 01:59:21,670
exhibition that we are having there what

2629
01:59:21,670 --> 01:59:23,620
such that there is a capture program of the

2630
01:59:23,620 --> 01:59:25,900
neighbor's keyboard how can it happen in

2631
01:59:25,900 --> 01:59:29,520
a good internet cafe or cafe whatever you call it

2632
01:59:29,520 --> 01:59:32,170
why because if we have a lot

2633
01:59:32,170 --> 01:59:35,050
confidence we think that it cannot be that

2634
01:59:35,050 --> 01:59:37,120
someone knows about these things when today

2635
01:59:37,120 --> 01:59:40,180
nowadays on youtube they exist as a support

2636
01:59:40,180 --> 01:59:42,670
how to install a keylogger to capture

2637
01:59:42,670 --> 01:59:45,340
the keyboard how to fake the webcam

2638
01:59:45,340 --> 01:59:48,040
how to capture the camera a number of

2639
01:59:48,040 --> 01:59:51,100
things that cybercriminals like

2640
01:59:51,100 --> 01:59:53,340
they said yesterday they have the motivation

2641
01:59:53,340 --> 01:59:56,620
because it is the motivation to deceive us

2642
01:59:56,620 --> 01:59:58,960
our children to ourselves

2643
01:59:58,960 --> 02:00:01,290
I envy the amount of very human things

2644
02:00:01,290 --> 02:00:03,580
So my question is what is the

2645
02:00:03,580 --> 02:00:06,219
motivation of you people

2646
02:00:06,219 --> 02:00:08,559
as normal as it is in his day to

2647
02:00:08,559 --> 02:00:10,780
day thinking that the responsibility of

2648
02:00:10,780 --> 02:00:13,510
digital security belongs to third parties and does not

2649
02:00:13,510 --> 02:00:16,360
we take charge also help

2650
02:00:16,360 --> 02:00:20,110
a little bit in that in that treatment of

2651
02:00:20,110 --> 02:00:23,619
our of our digital life then

2652
02:00:23,619 --> 02:00:25,749
with these four points it is but she

2653
02:00:25,749 --> 02:00:28,239
it is a little lighter harder

2654
02:00:28,239 --> 02:00:29,920
previous we believed as that little

2655
02:00:29,920 --> 02:00:33,010
reflection of what is how we are

2656
02:00:33,010 --> 02:00:36,369
embarking on the network and that many times

2657
02:00:36,369 --> 02:00:37,989
It's not our fault that what we have

2658
02:00:37,989 --> 02:00:40,990
to start making those bases

2659
02:00:40,990 --> 02:00:43,720
Let us now move on to that recognition that

2660
02:00:43,720 --> 02:00:47,290
there is already a reflection and we could give ourselves

2661
02:00:47,290 --> 02:00:49,990
that reflecting with more examples but

2662
02:00:49,990 --> 02:00:53,110
We now integrate some basic things

2663
02:00:53,110 --> 02:00:55,210
that go beyond thinking that it is a

2664
02:00:55,210 --> 02:00:58,120
engineering master's course

2665
02:00:58,120 --> 02:01:00,280
people who are experts from

2666
02:01:00,280 --> 02:01:02,110
here are things that handle them very well

2667
02:01:02,110 --> 02:01:06,040
for the uninitiated there will be things

2668
02:01:06,040 --> 02:01:08,050
to begin to understand and you have to

2669
02:01:08,050 --> 02:01:09,910
start with engineering story

2670
02:01:09,910 --> 02:01:12,760
social who have talked about it a lot yesterday

2671
02:01:12,760 --> 02:01:16,060
there were quite a few interesting talks from

2672
02:01:16,060 --> 02:01:19,930
elisabeth because martín exhibits it in

2673
02:01:19,930 --> 02:01:22,960
excellent grass and it is that in engineering

2674
02:01:22,960 --> 02:01:25,990
social that is is the famous art of

2675
02:01:25,990 --> 02:01:29,860
deceit and directly attacks the being

2676
02:01:29,860 --> 02:01:31,750
human

2677
02:01:31,750 --> 02:01:34,240
like how people can be

2678
02:01:34,240 --> 02:01:36,490
easily meat towards someone will say or me

2679
02:01:36,490 --> 02:01:39,490
What he has said is that since they exist

2680
02:01:39,490 --> 02:01:41,590
those social networks today is from the

2681
02:01:41,590 --> 02:01:44,050
cause as if before the internet no

2682
02:01:44,050 --> 02:01:46,960
nothing will happen and no one is fooling us true

2683
02:01:46,960 --> 02:01:49,330
well let me tell you that the deception

2684
02:01:49,330 --> 02:01:52,830
has existed for a long time

2685
02:01:52,830 --> 02:01:55,180
a lot and here are some examples

2686
02:01:55,180 --> 02:01:57,010
we have in this first image that

2687
02:01:57,010 --> 02:01:59,690
you see this lady here

2688
02:01:59,690 --> 02:02:04,700
she said in 1700 something she gave birth

2689
02:02:04,700 --> 02:02:07,850
rabbits with them as well as it sounds gave to

2690
02:02:07,850 --> 02:02:09,869
light with them

2691
02:02:09,869 --> 02:02:12,329
after convention convinced people

2692
02:02:12,329 --> 02:02:14,669
that it was true because because the lady

2693
02:02:14,669 --> 02:02:18,389
contacted an eminent doctor and had him

2694
02:02:18,389 --> 02:02:20,789
believe or preceded his wiles true

2695
02:02:20,789 --> 02:02:22,159
to make him believe that indeed

2696
02:02:22,159 --> 02:02:25,260
the doctor was giving birth with them

2697
02:02:25,260 --> 02:02:26,699
believed him men we are talking about

2698
02:02:26,699 --> 02:02:28,159
1700

2699
02:02:28,159 --> 02:02:31,709
until now there were little things that could be

2700
02:02:31,709 --> 02:02:33,959
and more in those places so remote and

2701
02:02:33,959 --> 02:02:36,479
separated because the doctor believed him and was

2702
02:02:36,479 --> 02:02:38,939
the voice for the people and the peoples

2703
02:02:38,939 --> 02:02:41,610
surrounding this doctor we could

2704
02:02:41,610 --> 02:02:43,499
compare it today with social networks

2705
02:02:43,499 --> 02:02:46,050
they did not believe this doctor as well as

2706
02:02:46,050 --> 02:02:48,449
we believe everything he says

2707
02:02:48,449 --> 02:02:51,840
felipe everything that appears happens to everything

2708
02:02:51,840 --> 02:02:54,090
what they share with us without thinking about it

2709
02:02:54,090 --> 02:02:55,560
times

2710
02:02:55,560 --> 02:02:58,950
nowadays this channel but let's see obviously

2711
02:02:58,950 --> 02:03:00,840
We are not going to believe that you do me to the

2712
02:03:00,840 --> 02:03:03,720
rabbits but nowadays they are another type of

2713
02:03:03,720 --> 02:03:05,760
things like me yes how are we going to continue

2714
02:03:05,760 --> 02:03:08,160
seeing the image in the center are one of

2715
02:03:08,160 --> 02:03:10,320
the first social experiments

2716
02:03:10,320 --> 02:03:14,370
back in 1950 a radio station that

2717
02:03:14,370 --> 02:03:16,920
said there was a town in england

2718
02:03:16,920 --> 02:03:18,990
that was had a tree that gave

2719
02:03:18,990 --> 02:03:22,320
spaghetti because people believed him

2720
02:03:22,320 --> 02:03:24,420
began to arrive in a massive way to that

2721
02:03:24,420 --> 02:03:27,870
little town and it means money talk

2722
02:03:27,870 --> 02:03:29,820
economy

2723
02:03:29,820 --> 02:03:32,730
We can also daily and well

2724
02:03:32,730 --> 02:03:34,380
then they came out it is and it is not that

2725
02:03:34,380 --> 02:03:36,540
we wanted to see how easy it was to cheat

2726
02:03:36,540 --> 02:03:39,210
people and this at the beginning of the

2727
02:03:39,210 --> 02:03:41,070
20th century the last image you see there

2728
02:03:41,070 --> 02:03:43,590
with a statue had to do with the theme

2729
02:03:43,590 --> 02:03:47,370
of religion, which is one of the themes

2730
02:03:47,370 --> 02:03:51,630
also quite quite that quite

2731
02:03:51,630 --> 02:03:55,050
moved remember that we can we can

2732
02:03:55,050 --> 02:03:57,960
use topics like religion like sports

2733
02:03:57,960 --> 02:04:01,110
as a policy to generate an amount

2734
02:04:01,110 --> 02:04:03,150
persuasion profiling things

2735
02:04:03,150 --> 02:04:05,970
manipulation etc, well, there are these people

2736
02:04:05,970 --> 02:04:07,890
they said if we found a statue

2737
02:04:07,890 --> 02:04:09,630
of a giant as some say

2738
02:04:09,630 --> 02:04:11,970
religious stories but it was a hoax

2739
02:04:11,970 --> 02:04:14,540
of a person who wanted revenge

2740
02:04:14,540 --> 02:04:18,300
then we are human beings we are

2741
02:04:18,300 --> 02:04:20,190
muddy we are believing but

2742
02:04:20,190 --> 02:04:22,650
So what we are is how deceit is

2743
02:04:22,650 --> 02:04:24,450
today, for example, not to mention here

2744
02:04:24,450 --> 02:04:27,090
we have this image this girl

2745
02:04:27,090 --> 02:04:28,920
I want us to think, I don't know if it has been

2746
02:04:28,920 --> 02:04:31,440
reached the text ok but they ask me

2747
02:04:31,440 --> 02:04:33,449
I want us to review here first the

2748
02:04:33,449 --> 02:04:36,210
forms the typical photos that call the

2749
02:04:36,210 --> 02:04:39,139
attention to the channel my god

2750
02:04:39,139 --> 02:04:41,699
she is sick

2751
02:04:41,699 --> 02:04:44,580
look at the phrase please pray for me for

2752
02:04:44,580 --> 02:04:47,760
Please, let's start with some phrases

2753
02:04:47,760 --> 02:04:50,670
widely used social engineering yoga in the

2754
02:04:50,670 --> 02:04:54,469
cancer is to say a cool battle

2755
02:04:54,469 --> 02:04:58,650
You have five seconds to see beyond the

2756
02:04:58,650 --> 02:05:01,440
text this is like this from the and you find out

2757
02:05:01,440 --> 02:05:04,260
of becomes that the person on the part

2758
02:05:04,260 --> 02:05:06,900
there if I have the seconds and if I know

2759
02:05:06,900 --> 02:05:09,170
They realize in the messages that from here

2760
02:05:09,170 --> 02:05:12,570
475 responses to date worldwide

2761
02:05:12,570 --> 02:05:15,420
supporting this girl that pour such

2762
02:05:15,420 --> 02:05:19,849
center has shared more than 29 thousand fish

2763
02:05:19,849 --> 02:05:21,869
three hundred and fifty-odd thousand already

2764
02:05:21,869 --> 02:05:24,179
comment for a number of things

2765
02:05:24,179 --> 02:05:26,610
terrible spelling but that's it

2766
02:05:26,610 --> 02:05:29,489
another topic where we do share

2767
02:05:29,489 --> 02:05:32,310
share more we share two or three yes

2768
02:05:32,310 --> 02:05:35,690
it was analyzed s of that girl we see

2769
02:05:35,690 --> 02:05:37,820
really who no longer looks so

2770
02:05:37,820 --> 02:05:40,219
sick miraculously healed and thank you

2771
02:05:40,219 --> 02:05:42,290
to god but facebook later it happened

2772
02:05:42,290 --> 02:05:44,510
account that it was a false profile are those

2773
02:05:44,510 --> 02:05:47,870
famous profiles that are created to make

2774
02:05:47,870 --> 02:05:50,659
the famous farms of likes where well

2775
02:05:50,659 --> 02:05:52,790
the line of conversation and each that

2776
02:05:52,790 --> 02:05:54,620
we share that because you will say why

2777
02:05:54,620 --> 02:05:56,679
web I can not share that solidarity

2778
02:05:56,679 --> 02:05:59,840
if solidarity is very important but

2779
02:05:59,840 --> 02:06:01,940
nowadays it has to be more proactive and

2780
02:06:01,940 --> 02:06:03,949
Let's stop momentarily and review for what

2781
02:06:03,949 --> 02:06:05,690
minus the comments that someone will say

2782
02:06:05,690 --> 02:06:08,690
that's false let's not go crazy

2783
02:06:08,690 --> 02:06:10,940
sharing giving to her because

2784
02:06:10,940 --> 02:06:13,100
we are on the one hand filling the

2785
02:06:13,100 --> 02:06:17,120
pockets of cybercriminals but for

2786
02:06:17,120 --> 02:06:19,040
other side we are also giving a lot

2787
02:06:19,040 --> 02:06:21,140
screen leaving data that can be

2788
02:06:21,140 --> 02:06:23,630
very useful for profiling if I know the

2789
02:06:23,630 --> 02:06:25,909
comments there are several people who

2790
02:06:25,909 --> 02:06:27,920
support these causes because more in a

2791
02:06:27,920 --> 02:06:29,750
Easier center to send emails

2792
02:06:29,750 --> 02:06:32,940
send messages in front of them

2793
02:06:32,940 --> 02:06:36,980
and I said it, all this serves to outline

2794
02:06:36,980 --> 02:06:39,660
how is it shaping up at the moment and what

2795
02:06:39,660 --> 02:06:42,630
the experts know the experts

2796
02:06:42,630 --> 02:06:45,480
that while we are talking here I don't know

2797
02:06:45,480 --> 02:06:47,250
they are profiling all those of one u

2798
02:06:47,250 --> 02:06:50,330
another way we have a digital life is

2799
02:06:50,330 --> 02:06:53,420
they go and look in our

2800
02:06:53,420 --> 02:06:55,590
needs is that I am next to

2801
02:06:55,590 --> 02:06:59,130
I work more my girlfriend left me I'm alone

2802
02:06:59,130 --> 02:07:01,980
blah blah blah what emotions in young people

2803
02:07:01,980 --> 02:07:04,440
for the program of the day loneliness

2804
02:07:04,440 --> 02:07:06,480
minors is a subject that engages

2805
02:07:06,480 --> 02:07:09,540
a lot and the two cybercriminals do not know

2806
02:07:09,540 --> 02:07:12,510
the ignorance that's why my invitation

2807
02:07:12,510 --> 02:07:14,690
to which any person

2808
02:07:14,690 --> 02:07:17,310
it is your responsibility to learn the basics

2809
02:07:17,310 --> 02:07:19,890
as a student why are you doing here

2810
02:07:19,890 --> 02:07:23,430
they will have is precisely that to carry that

2811
02:07:23,430 --> 02:07:25,290
knowledge to those who use to those who

2812
02:07:25,290 --> 02:07:27,840
sanz keep learning day by day because

2813
02:07:27,840 --> 02:07:29,580
digital security is everyone's business

2814
02:07:29,580 --> 02:07:32,370
and well a number of things that with

2815
02:07:32,370 --> 02:07:35,159
those who seek in each one

2816
02:07:35,159 --> 02:07:37,739
people how to get where everything is

2817
02:07:37,739 --> 02:07:39,989
This is obviously on the networks

2818
02:07:39,989 --> 02:07:43,139
social a while ago a while ago

2819
02:07:43,139 --> 02:07:45,300
about 30 years ago for her what was he like

2820
02:07:45,300 --> 02:07:47,639
subject the subject of age I want to find out the

2821
02:07:47,639 --> 02:07:49,739
life of this gentleman who is the director of

2822
02:07:49,739 --> 02:07:53,760
you are either the managing director or you are

2823
02:07:53,760 --> 02:07:55,889
than daughters or sons, well, one

2824
02:07:55,889 --> 02:07:58,079
truck take pictures with binoculars

2825
02:07:58,079 --> 02:08:00,959
what time does it leave at what time does it arrive where

2826
02:08:00,959 --> 02:08:03,239
He went to have coffee, right, you have to

2827
02:08:03,239 --> 02:08:05,760
school that friends have today

2828
02:08:05,760 --> 02:08:07,979
well, that's on the net, it's much more

2829
02:08:07,979 --> 02:08:10,519
simple much easier and it is that

2830
02:08:10,519 --> 02:08:14,130
we share everything we are

2831
02:08:14,130 --> 02:08:15,829
sharing

2832
02:08:15,829 --> 02:08:18,719
our intimate moments of life that

2833
02:08:18,719 --> 02:08:21,419
is the term of over xavi is the envelope

2834
02:08:21,419 --> 02:08:23,849
to have information and look that this

2835
02:08:23,849 --> 02:08:25,369
it goes a little beyond the technical

2836
02:08:25,369 --> 02:08:28,650
intimate moments of life is the

2837
02:08:28,650 --> 02:08:30,840
intimate term I didn't like those very much

2838
02:08:30,840 --> 02:08:32,999
terms because then we lose the year

2839
02:08:32,999 --> 02:08:35,340
when we are not clear there is a video

2840
02:08:35,340 --> 02:08:38,349
that I have in my intimate channel

2841
02:08:38,349 --> 02:08:40,659
means you should not have any

2842
02:08:40,659 --> 02:08:41,499
Registration

2843
02:08:41,499 --> 02:08:42,969
that's simple

2844
02:08:42,969 --> 02:08:45,879
if you already have a photo if you already have your

2845
02:08:45,879 --> 02:08:48,189
videos and you wrote a text is already one

2846
02:08:48,189 --> 02:08:50,649
It is not intimate, it is not private or what

2847
02:08:50,649 --> 02:08:53,859
private public aeronautical then it is

2848
02:08:53,859 --> 02:08:56,039
the invitation for you that is intimate

2849
02:08:56,039 --> 02:08:59,649
because it remembers if there is a record of

2850
02:08:59,649 --> 02:09:02,499
something that is intimate for you is already private

2851
02:09:02,499 --> 02:09:04,989
and you can lose seen the plans

2852
02:09:04,989 --> 02:09:07,179
vacation we go to cartagena and

2853
02:09:07,179 --> 02:09:10,119
all the photos of the tickets in the

2854
02:09:10,119 --> 02:09:13,209
cloud plane can be done with

2855
02:09:13,209 --> 02:09:14,709
this you can do many things for

2856
02:09:14,709 --> 02:09:16,510
example the thieves decided the

2857
02:09:16,510 --> 02:09:19,030
home is alone welcome but also

2858
02:09:19,030 --> 02:09:22,059
you can impersonation as we saw yesterday in

2859
02:09:22,059 --> 02:09:24,099
a serial talk that the person who

2860
02:09:24,099 --> 02:09:26,790
was is the accounting is traveling

2861
02:09:26,790 --> 02:09:27,929
[Music]

2862
02:09:27,929 --> 02:09:30,449
no one can make us a few calls

2863
02:09:30,449 --> 02:09:31,860
life is that today had been

2864
02:09:31,860 --> 02:09:34,650
fully this occasion and to you

2865
02:09:34,650 --> 02:09:37,050
they know how the whole story is to achieve

2866
02:09:37,050 --> 02:09:40,380
persuade and manipulate states

2867
02:09:40,380 --> 02:09:42,659
states of guasave that we place in

2868
02:09:42,659 --> 02:09:45,179
Social networks are a source of

2869
02:09:45,179 --> 02:09:48,599
very big information and excuse me in

2870
02:09:48,599 --> 02:09:50,280
the özil experts and all this but

2871
02:09:50,280 --> 02:09:52,050
look at the successes that it is in some

2872
02:09:52,050 --> 02:09:53,889
moments this

2873
02:09:53,889 --> 02:09:55,959
you can find an amount is

2874
02:09:55,959 --> 02:09:58,809
because we are placing everything I am

2875
02:09:58,809 --> 02:10:01,329
sad my girlfriend told me I'm without

2876
02:10:01,329 --> 02:10:03,639
work and that can be very useful for

2877
02:10:03,639 --> 02:10:05,829
that profiling answers to the

2878
02:10:05,829 --> 02:10:08,349
questions are created tests in some

2879
02:10:08,349 --> 02:10:10,539
good services this is a little example

2880
02:10:10,539 --> 02:10:13,599
common but for us to understand

2881
02:10:13,599 --> 02:10:17,199
I want to hack so-and-so's social network

2882
02:10:17,199 --> 02:10:18,820
this service and I forgot the

2883
02:10:18,820 --> 02:10:21,519
password then to the question

2884
02:10:21,519 --> 02:10:24,249
secret the service sector and the typical

2885
02:10:24,249 --> 02:10:27,329
question is difficult pet name

2886
02:10:27,329 --> 02:10:29,860
baa1 to instagram and if it is filu like

2887
02:10:29,860 --> 02:10:32,050
moving if lula inserting cell phone and

2888
02:10:32,050 --> 02:10:35,079
sleeping finlay stomach because

2889
02:10:35,079 --> 02:10:37,769
we are over exposing the information

2890
02:10:37,769 --> 02:10:41,350
insult defame here send

2891
02:10:41,350 --> 02:10:43,690
exactly has to do with everything

2892
02:10:43,690 --> 02:10:45,989
theme of coexistence

2893
02:10:45,989 --> 02:10:48,480
I want to talk about this in terms of not

2894
02:10:48,480 --> 02:10:50,999
I am referring to all freedom of

2895
02:10:50,999 --> 02:10:53,550
expression because it is a right that

2896
02:10:53,550 --> 02:10:55,499
we have but sometimes we get out of hand and

2897
02:10:55,499 --> 02:10:57,860
according to a freedom of aggression

2898
02:10:57,860 --> 02:11:01,079
and we are many many the example for

2899
02:11:01,079 --> 02:11:04,230
other generations not the same as we create

2900
02:11:04,230 --> 02:11:06,719
destability also serves to outline

2901
02:11:06,719 --> 02:11:09,269
if I see that you are a person who is is

2902
02:11:09,269 --> 02:11:10,860
quite alive when spoken in

2903
02:11:10,860 --> 02:11:13,110
good politics out there it can be the

2904
02:11:13,110 --> 02:11:13,909
business

2905
02:11:13,909 --> 02:11:16,920
compromising photographs not only

2906
02:11:16,920 --> 02:11:19,079
I'm talking about the photo in a bikini or what?

2907
02:11:19,079 --> 02:11:21,630
encourages when walking things but

2908
02:11:21,630 --> 02:11:23,730
also the photo of the entrance what

2909
02:11:23,730 --> 02:11:26,670
leaves enters the house the license plate of the car

2910
02:11:26,670 --> 02:11:30,480
or the famous photo of the post I'm not with

2911
02:11:30,480 --> 02:11:33,539
my cup in front of my computer and my

2912
02:11:33,539 --> 02:11:35,519
job with the pósito

2913
02:11:35,519 --> 02:11:37,489
password we return to the same

2914
02:11:37,489 --> 02:11:40,590
financial information we have because

2915
02:11:40,590 --> 02:11:43,139
is posting that kind of stuff

2916
02:11:43,139 --> 02:11:44,699
intimacy of the children of happened

2917
02:11:44,699 --> 02:11:47,639
march in you we are happy as parents

2918
02:11:47,639 --> 02:11:49,679
posting the photo in chipping of two

2919
02:11:49,679 --> 02:11:52,100
years dating in the shower

2920
02:11:52,100 --> 02:11:55,980
and nothing happens when we understand that there is

2921
02:11:55,980 --> 02:11:57,440
markets

2922
02:11:57,440 --> 02:12:01,230
but jumps at the level of the flesh where

2923
02:12:01,230 --> 02:12:03,750
can this type of images but also

2924
02:12:03,750 --> 02:12:06,300
That child is going to grow up to see those I was going to

2925
02:12:06,300 --> 02:12:08,820
growing up is going to be 13 14 years old stress

2926
02:12:08,820 --> 02:12:11,400
internet do not forget despite the right

2927
02:12:11,400 --> 02:12:14,550
of good but he sneaks in because of Arian he removed and

2928
02:12:14,550 --> 02:12:16,350
what will happen when the friends of

2929
02:12:16,350 --> 02:12:18,870
little boy find it to be well hair

2930
02:12:18,870 --> 02:12:22,230
ticos well cyberbullying sponsor by

2931
02:12:22,230 --> 02:12:24,420
their parents then let's keep in mind

2932
02:12:24,420 --> 02:12:27,719
these examples because there are many more with

2933
02:12:27,719 --> 02:12:30,570
manipulation can be having these

2934
02:12:30,570 --> 02:12:33,449
data the process begins to persuade

2935
02:12:33,449 --> 02:12:35,640
and manipulate persuaded in the part

2936
02:12:35,640 --> 02:12:37,770
pretty or in today's part

2937
02:12:37,770 --> 02:12:39,810
mail that says look we detect that there is

2938
02:12:39,810 --> 02:12:42,239
something but we are going to help you person is

2939
02:12:42,239 --> 02:12:45,980
the famous message on the call of d

2940
02:12:45,980 --> 02:12:48,650
I am loved is being monitored by

2941
02:12:48,650 --> 02:12:52,270
your safety thanks to those personal

2942
02:12:52,270 --> 02:12:55,460
to later manage to manipulate, that is,

2943
02:12:55,460 --> 02:12:58,130
to think to make the person drink

2944
02:12:58,130 --> 02:13:00,770
that decision that is not the best

2945
02:13:00,770 --> 02:13:02,739
but then

2946
02:13:02,739 --> 02:13:05,330
what are the techniques there are many

2947
02:13:05,330 --> 02:13:08,120
techniques this theme the dense because here

2948
02:13:08,120 --> 02:13:10,730
we could stay talking about biases

2949
02:13:10,730 --> 02:13:13,880
cognitive of all biases

2950
02:13:13,880 --> 02:13:16,340
thought logistics is brothers

2951
02:13:16,340 --> 02:13:18,830
confirmation area bias

2952
02:13:18,830 --> 02:13:20,780
amount of things that is how we work

2953
02:13:20,780 --> 02:13:22,640
human beings that is, there is no other

2954
02:13:22,640 --> 02:13:25,160
if we work and take advantage of that and

2955
02:13:25,160 --> 02:13:27,290
evolutionarily biases exist for

2956
02:13:27,290 --> 02:13:30,350
in theory it is the easiest way for us but

2957
02:13:30,350 --> 02:13:32,300
we have seen it in advertising we have

2958
02:13:32,300 --> 02:13:36,290
seen in the 'news we've seen it in

2959
02:13:36,290 --> 02:13:39,260
social engineering that the matter can be

2960
02:13:39,260 --> 02:13:41,600
get out of hand we talk about you

2961
02:13:41,600 --> 02:13:43,670
we are not talking about ruiz is another term

2962
02:13:43,670 --> 02:13:46,040
also that it is used a lot at the time of

2963
02:13:46,040 --> 02:13:48,890
make decisions then how to do that

2964
02:13:48,890 --> 02:13:51,460
people go the other way

2965
02:13:51,460 --> 02:13:54,970
they said in the least appropriate way and

2966
02:13:54,970 --> 02:13:58,120
we find many do not reciprocate

2967
02:13:58,120 --> 02:14:00,250
towards my mind I am someone but

2968
02:14:00,250 --> 02:14:03,280
we if that's how we work divert the

2969
02:14:03,280 --> 02:14:05,440
systems thinking through

2970
02:14:05,440 --> 02:14:06,850
systems thinking is that we

2971
02:14:06,850 --> 02:14:09,100
bring to a moment I like this

2972
02:14:09,100 --> 02:14:10,870
exercise face-to-face talks

2973
02:14:10,870 --> 02:14:12,460
we are talking and moment to another says

2974
02:14:12,460 --> 02:14:14,470
for god's sake it's shaking and I'm going out

2975
02:14:14,470 --> 02:14:16,330
running and behind me to a quantity

2976
02:14:16,330 --> 02:14:18,100
people

2977
02:14:18,100 --> 02:14:19,810
the same you will say no but mark that the

2978
02:14:19,810 --> 02:14:22,060
Mirandés was yes but it would be like

2979
02:14:22,060 --> 02:14:25,270
logical to stop all this for a moment

2980
02:14:25,270 --> 02:14:27,370
you are what you seek that over time

2981
02:14:27,370 --> 02:14:30,430
that trust can be generated

2982
02:14:30,430 --> 02:14:33,370
we create everything that appears there everything

2983
02:14:33,370 --> 02:14:36,310
tell us everything else that has happened

2984
02:14:36,310 --> 02:14:40,210
during that time and let's trust that

2985
02:14:40,210 --> 02:14:44,110
that is to say, all this leads to that

2986
02:14:44,110 --> 02:14:46,540
we are vulnerable as human beings

2987
02:14:46,540 --> 02:14:49,120
it is a fact we are vulnerable and we must

2988
02:14:49,120 --> 02:14:51,550
understand that when digital matter

2989
02:14:51,550 --> 02:14:53,770
we refer to devices that also

2990
02:14:53,770 --> 02:14:57,130
they are vulnerable true it fails him that

2991
02:14:57,130 --> 02:14:59,980
they can enter the malware etc. but

2992
02:14:59,980 --> 02:15:02,320
as human beings we are in charge

2993
02:15:02,320 --> 02:15:04,300
that all these devices are

2994
02:15:04,300 --> 02:15:06,670
less vulnerable already according to a suite of

2995
02:15:06,670 --> 02:15:08,890
security either with learning that

2996
02:15:08,890 --> 02:15:11,290
we are seeing and other things but it is

2997
02:15:11,290 --> 02:15:13,840
that that that set not human beings

2998
02:15:13,840 --> 02:15:15,640
devices and the device is

2999
02:15:15,640 --> 02:15:17,890
vulnerable as a human being i am

3000
02:15:17,890 --> 02:15:19,120
vulnerable

3001
02:15:19,120 --> 02:15:20,830
I am vulnerable and I can do my

3002
02:15:20,830 --> 02:15:23,020
device is too then

3003
02:15:23,020 --> 02:15:24,880
we have to be aware of

3004
02:15:24,880 --> 02:15:28,850
balance balance those two things

3005
02:15:28,850 --> 02:15:31,750
of size

3006
02:15:31,920 --> 02:15:33,420
malware

3007
02:15:33,420 --> 02:15:35,820
in devices then appears the

3008
02:15:35,820 --> 02:15:38,160
malware for years we talk about viruses every

3009
02:15:38,160 --> 02:15:42,540
are more and more publishing virus viruses and ago

3010
02:15:42,540 --> 02:15:45,000
years it was the fault of the computer virus

3011
02:15:45,000 --> 02:15:47,070
it was slow it's a virus has run

3012
02:15:47,070 --> 02:15:49,290
It's a virus, come in, it's going to hide those

3013
02:15:49,290 --> 02:15:52,140
videos because nowadays malware encompasses

3014
02:15:52,140 --> 02:15:54,330
many more things we are not talking about trojans

3015
02:15:54,330 --> 02:15:57,060
speaking of using us we speak for example

3016
02:15:57,060 --> 02:15:58,920
the famous ramson web that is to say the

3017
02:15:58,920 --> 02:16:02,250
hijacking of information to know now

3018
02:16:02,250 --> 02:16:03,690
maybe he made me a little screen that we

3019
02:16:03,690 --> 02:16:05,910
let it pass or they actually deciphered

3020
02:16:05,910 --> 02:16:08,340
the data and you cannot recover it and

3021
02:16:08,340 --> 02:16:09,870
even worse after finishing selling

3022
02:16:09,870 --> 02:16:12,660
who knows where then from here to think

3023
02:16:12,660 --> 02:16:16,250
in that and many of these

3024
02:16:16,250 --> 02:16:18,920
each day they are more sophisticated and more

3025
02:16:18,920 --> 02:16:20,540
complex

3026
02:16:20,540 --> 02:16:22,730
we have the drawings that capture the

3027
02:16:22,730 --> 02:16:25,970
center image keyboard and it is not

3028
02:16:25,970 --> 02:16:28,460
complex even i had a demo

3029
02:16:28,460 --> 02:16:31,460
face-to-face is to download a drawing that

3030
02:16:31,460 --> 02:16:33,200
interest we find it and promptly

3031
02:16:33,200 --> 02:16:35,209
Second team is what I need to do

3032
02:16:35,209 --> 02:16:37,308
a university job or you are taking

3033
02:16:37,308 --> 02:16:40,160
if it is my girlfriend my mind I have confidence

3034
02:16:40,160 --> 02:16:42,980
use the practical was already here place the

3035
02:16:42,980 --> 02:16:44,840
antivirus warning like crazy which ones

3036
02:16:44,840 --> 02:16:47,990
sirens of the quiet submarine

3037
02:16:47,990 --> 02:16:50,179
antivirus is a false positive and there it is

3038
02:16:50,179 --> 02:16:52,790
distar and then after if I have

3039
02:16:52,790 --> 02:16:55,099
talk he bought filiberto this is what

3040
02:16:55,099 --> 02:16:56,840
What is the digital or will not arrive the

3041
02:16:56,840 --> 02:17:00,170
plain text that is to say as it is to my house

3042
02:17:00,170 --> 02:17:04,120
to my mail we have places we have

3043
02:17:04,120 --> 02:17:07,459
trojans animating flesh trojans

3044
02:17:07,459 --> 02:17:09,980
andina activate the webcam at the level of

3045
02:17:09,980 --> 02:17:12,080
activate the microphone that many listen to

3046
02:17:12,080 --> 02:17:15,010
cell phones

3047
02:17:15,790 --> 02:17:20,219
so that's how to comply

3048
02:17:20,219 --> 02:17:23,440
we also have the fish and difficult

3049
02:17:23,440 --> 02:17:25,990
They have already made it difficult today, these are correct

3050
02:17:25,990 --> 02:17:27,700
that they do not want so we can fall

3051
02:17:27,700 --> 02:17:29,501
here this is real is that it is an account

3052
02:17:29,501 --> 02:17:31,960
mine that rather I have it there for

3053
02:17:31,960 --> 02:17:34,240
let them attack what they want where

3054
02:17:34,240 --> 02:17:36,841
I have won prizes that you see there

3055
02:17:36,841 --> 02:17:39,309
where the registry office

3056
02:17:39,309 --> 02:17:42,550
quoted 20 thousand times never where I have a

3057
02:17:42,550 --> 02:17:44,730
embargo in a court where they had

3058
02:17:44,730 --> 02:17:46,450
purpose we are in on the trick

3059
02:17:46,450 --> 02:17:48,790
statements here be careful the

3060
02:17:48,790 --> 02:17:51,639
banks describe then you give because

3061
02:17:51,639 --> 02:17:53,530
if it is true that the bank still

3062
02:17:53,530 --> 02:17:55,300
wait hold

3063
02:17:55,300 --> 02:17:57,910
because well I'm not going to fall into this without

3064
02:17:57,910 --> 02:17:59,800
However, obviously some look

3065
02:17:59,800 --> 02:18:01,480
because art is true and here we go

3066
02:18:01,480 --> 02:18:04,270
wasting the year however it is not

3067
02:18:04,270 --> 02:18:07,331
bite the heat as the motto says by

3068
02:18:07,331 --> 02:18:09,280
Where does all this come from?

3069
02:18:09,280 --> 02:18:12,880
emails that we already placed to see and it is the

3070
02:18:12,880 --> 02:18:14,950
mail is still the largest source

3071
02:18:14,950 --> 02:18:17,559
Where does all this kind of deception come from?

3072
02:18:17,559 --> 02:18:19,389
where we can download malware where

3073
02:18:19,389 --> 02:18:21,341
can legally df asking for the data

3074
02:18:21,341 --> 02:18:23,171
not necessarily bad but about

3075
02:18:23,171 --> 02:18:24,820
exposing data

3076
02:18:24,820 --> 02:18:26,730
where we find malicious pages

3077
02:18:26,730 --> 02:18:29,680
We see pages that just enter and

3078
02:18:29,680 --> 02:18:32,290
be able to happen something with the announcements the

3079
02:18:32,290 --> 02:18:34,450
next ad here system

3080
02:18:34,450 --> 02:18:37,180
applications not updated we have a

3081
02:18:37,180 --> 02:18:39,940
side of 20 years ago and we are not

3082
02:18:39,940 --> 02:18:41,440
updating it looks like three

3083
02:18:41,440 --> 02:18:43,270
Business

3084
02:18:43,270 --> 02:18:45,700
update one of 200 when we pay

3085
02:18:45,700 --> 02:18:47,139
windows

3086
02:18:47,139 --> 02:18:49,600
perez you have to do

3087
02:18:49,600 --> 02:18:51,670
browser extensions to

3088
02:18:51,670 --> 02:18:54,010
watch the video then let's install this

3089
02:18:54,010 --> 02:18:57,760
plugin and finally remote access and that

3090
02:18:57,760 --> 02:19:00,459
widely used remote access software

3091
02:19:00,459 --> 02:19:03,280
very legal but sometimes we can

3092
02:19:03,280 --> 02:19:05,559
cheat with other kinds of things or are we

3093
02:19:05,559 --> 02:19:07,209
giving excess and more nowadays because

3094
02:19:07,209 --> 02:19:09,459
as a dose with the work of the video etc

3095
02:19:09,459 --> 02:19:12,959
whatsapp messaging apps

3096
02:19:12,959 --> 02:19:15,510
telegram we have to know that it can be done

3097
02:19:15,510 --> 02:19:16,950
also send in any of the

3098
02:19:16,950 --> 02:19:18,780
messages that can be seen some cannot

3099
02:19:18,780 --> 02:19:21,120
I'm talking about the technical part of

3100
02:19:21,120 --> 02:19:23,400
security I'm talking about what look

3101
02:19:23,400 --> 02:19:26,760
Here I send you this link, click on it

3102
02:19:26,760 --> 02:19:30,420
there is famous usb and we found the

3103
02:19:30,420 --> 02:19:33,660
usb and we put laundry or some

3104
02:19:33,660 --> 02:19:36,030
employee who is going to unload things

3105
02:19:36,030 --> 02:19:38,519
we have seen there are also with the and sainz

3106
02:19:38,519 --> 02:19:40,769
jr always now the electric ones

3107
02:19:40,769 --> 02:19:44,459
more deceptions we find this true goes

3108
02:19:44,459 --> 02:19:46,709
beyond the technical 10 to which I

3109
02:19:46,709 --> 02:19:48,318
I go with the talk

3110
02:19:48,318 --> 02:19:50,340
Let's realize that this is everyday

3111
02:19:50,340 --> 02:19:51,539
Anyone

3112
02:19:51,539 --> 02:19:54,810
NASA sets the date May 6, the date ends

3113
02:19:54,810 --> 02:19:56,399
world the world ends three times

3114
02:19:56,399 --> 02:19:59,039
brother hour half weirder no

3115
02:19:59,039 --> 02:20:01,770
they capitalized and suddenly I right now

3116
02:20:01,770 --> 02:20:03,659
passing September the end of the

3117
02:20:03,659 --> 02:20:05,939
world if not the collison collider

3118
02:20:05,939 --> 02:20:09,000
that it will be a black hole will

3119
02:20:09,000 --> 02:20:11,909
be an asteroid normally and we believe

3120
02:20:11,909 --> 02:20:14,000
that always to profile for

3121
02:20:14,000 --> 02:20:16,920
destabilize to finish last

3122
02:20:16,920 --> 02:20:20,609
selling food from the future of the end or

3123
02:20:20,609 --> 02:20:24,659
the sad news like this we see

3124
02:20:24,659 --> 02:20:26,819
a lot especially when downloaded

3125
02:20:26,819 --> 02:20:30,180
certain kind of sad movies and games

3126
02:20:30,180 --> 02:20:32,159
news like so you have to install

3127
02:20:32,159 --> 02:20:34,529
a plugin to be able to see the ham or the

3128
02:20:34,529 --> 02:20:36,840
famous person who died, he did not die and

3129
02:20:36,840 --> 02:20:38,990
martin or please

3130
02:20:38,990 --> 02:20:42,570
everyone calm down because what we do

3131
02:20:42,570 --> 02:20:45,979
That is what sometimes calls that tension there

3132
02:20:45,979 --> 02:20:50,010
and like that and we are lazy what is it

3133
02:20:50,010 --> 02:20:51,620
we have to do there so let's do

3134
02:20:51,620 --> 02:20:54,540
let's compare let's go and check in a

3135
02:20:54,540 --> 02:20:59,250
information medium or whether digital will be

3136
02:20:59,250 --> 02:21:01,460
that is true but please never

3137
02:21:01,460 --> 02:21:04,170
we created the first instance in this by

3138
02:21:04,170 --> 02:21:06,610
more striking than appear

3139
02:21:06,610 --> 02:21:10,750
because it is usually false but let's see

3140
02:21:10,750 --> 02:21:12,670
what I was saying right now we are in

3141
02:21:12,670 --> 02:21:14,380
time tax returns here at

3142
02:21:14,380 --> 02:21:17,380
Colombia the day and good in other countries

3143
02:21:17,380 --> 02:21:19,301
leave from tax addresses

3144
02:21:19,301 --> 02:21:21,280
but this is very level change

3145
02:21:21,280 --> 02:21:24,040
several countries where you already look at it you have not

3146
02:21:24,040 --> 02:21:27,101
paid taxes next or last

3147
02:21:27,101 --> 02:21:30,551
it is that it is this circular what it is

3148
02:21:30,551 --> 02:21:33,880
that of occasional profit and comma quote

3149
02:21:33,880 --> 02:21:37,150
download here on the trojan or the famous

3150
02:21:37,150 --> 02:21:40,120
photo fine tour a photo fine and one

3151
02:21:40,120 --> 02:21:42,250
anguished like so many photos I go

3152
02:21:42,250 --> 02:21:44,170
to download the file after me

3153
02:21:44,170 --> 02:21:45,940
I agree that I don't have a car but anyway

3154
02:21:45,940 --> 02:21:47,801
download it because it was that they took my

3155
02:21:47,801 --> 02:21:49,870
photo and next to another car we put together

3156
02:21:49,870 --> 02:21:51,460
all the stories because we are beings

3157
02:21:51,460 --> 02:21:53,950
humans and we are engaging a

3158
02:21:53,950 --> 02:21:56,200
device that as we see that it is

3159
02:21:56,200 --> 02:21:58,271
compromising not us and how

3160
02:21:58,271 --> 02:22:00,430
we saw is contributing to all

3161
02:22:00,430 --> 02:22:03,279
so what to do then you have to call

3162
02:22:03,279 --> 02:22:07,100
I know that laziness remains

3163
02:22:07,100 --> 02:22:09,739
five minutes a month also took

3164
02:22:09,739 --> 02:22:12,409
those five laziness but then you have to

3165
02:22:12,409 --> 02:22:14,779
make the call put there are no music

3166
02:22:14,779 --> 02:22:17,239
but cybercriminals know we are

3167
02:22:17,239 --> 02:22:19,159
lazy and that it is much easier to do

3168
02:22:19,159 --> 02:22:21,680
useful to put on a check you have to

3169
02:22:21,680 --> 02:22:24,020
do never click on these things

3170
02:22:24,020 --> 02:22:27,380
More Adidas Influencers Hoaxes About

everything for young people free tennis

3172
02:22:29,270 --> 02:22:32,630
we keep dropping the messaging with

3173
02:22:32,630 --> 02:22:35,270
whatsapp for example the action

3174
02:22:35,270 --> 02:22:36,739
whatsapp is as simple as

3175
02:22:36,739 --> 02:22:38,510
lend me your phone you don't have it

3176
02:22:38,510 --> 02:22:40,220
william you don't have a password this is

3177
02:22:40,220 --> 02:22:43,040
very technical and well, the clone there

3178
02:22:43,040 --> 02:22:45,050
we have on the computer on another cell phone

3179
02:22:45,050 --> 02:22:47,359
a browser can explore both

3180
02:22:47,359 --> 02:22:50,359
no problem the famous message in

3181
02:22:50,359 --> 02:22:52,189
life is to change cell phones and without

3182
02:22:52,189 --> 02:22:55,040
blame digital with the photo and ops without

3183
02:22:55,040 --> 02:22:57,140
fault digit 1 but you can't pass this

3184
02:22:57,140 --> 02:22:58,729
because I'm activating a new

3185
02:22:58,729 --> 02:23:02,769
single ticket costs one hundred

3186
02:23:02,930 --> 02:23:06,319
and the messenger who are people who

3187
02:23:06,319 --> 02:23:08,449
they come from other countries and they mature

3188
02:23:08,449 --> 02:23:11,810
I meditate on this type of thing and we are done

3189
02:23:11,810 --> 02:23:14,660
ending apps that also do

3190
02:23:14,660 --> 02:23:16,819
an amount I want to see with a life

3191
02:23:16,819 --> 02:23:18,410
times assumed as a mean of 100 years

3192
02:23:18,410 --> 02:23:21,020
we are giving a quantity of information or

3193
02:23:21,020 --> 02:23:22,790
a little flashlight that what i should do

3194
02:23:22,790 --> 02:23:25,220
is to turn on the lights and have more but yes

3195
02:23:25,220 --> 02:23:28,250
We analyze the permissions ago

3196
02:23:28,250 --> 02:23:31,300
calls send to that trick month so that

3197
02:23:31,300 --> 02:23:34,580
With the coronavirus and more stonecutters there are

3198
02:23:34,580 --> 02:23:36,710
What to do first to be taken care of

3199
02:23:36,710 --> 02:23:39,739
legal although we know that place tour

3200
02:23:39,739 --> 02:23:42,109
lets go of many things but for what

3201
02:23:42,109 --> 02:23:44,449
least not an act in any of these

3202
02:23:44,449 --> 02:23:46,699
other things if that happens with adults

3203
02:23:46,699 --> 02:23:49,399
image of monkeys to our children

3204
02:23:49,399 --> 02:23:52,130
age to everything you face when

3205
02:23:52,130 --> 02:23:53,930
I'm talking about judgments and decisions and

3206
02:23:53,930 --> 02:23:55,760
we don't have them clear as an adult

3207
02:23:55,760 --> 02:23:57,890
Imagine an 89-year-old boy with a

3208
02:23:57,890 --> 02:24:00,199
life and also active having to take

3209
02:24:00,199 --> 02:24:02,090
decisions on a daily basis

3210
02:24:02,090 --> 02:24:04,970
Biologically he still can't take it anymore

3211
02:24:04,970 --> 02:24:06,830
that we

3212
02:24:06,830 --> 02:24:09,680
It is a genre from the technical point of view, yes, but

3213
02:24:09,680 --> 02:24:12,200
as a decision maker

3214
02:24:12,200 --> 02:24:14,000
has to discern between what is real

3215
02:24:14,000 --> 02:24:15,650
and what is fiction between the good and the

3216
02:24:15,650 --> 02:24:18,380
bad etc is complete and this goes to

3217
02:24:18,380 --> 02:24:21,140
you talk someday and the news

3218
02:24:21,140 --> 02:24:23,540
trends there are already some talks

3219
02:24:23,540 --> 02:24:25,940
so they can see the stress better

3220
02:24:25,940 --> 02:24:28,670
He has already talked about this whole subject of allot and

3221
02:24:28,670 --> 02:24:30,710
the internet of things the clock that its

3222
02:24:30,710 --> 02:24:33,440
customers smart TVs the

3223
02:24:33,440 --> 02:24:36,470
blog theme change nfts with all the

3224
02:24:36,470 --> 02:24:38,860
new scams brewing

3225
02:24:38,860 --> 02:24:42,050
falsification of pages like pencil etc

3226
02:24:42,050 --> 02:24:45,170
artificial intelligence a famous face

3227
02:24:45,170 --> 02:24:47,600
if we believe a photo because it is

3228
02:24:47,600 --> 02:24:49,580
he got into the photo let's imagine

3229
02:24:49,580 --> 02:24:52,610
with a video shot grace to do

3230
02:24:52,610 --> 02:24:54,830
then to finish you have to

3231
02:24:54,830 --> 02:24:57,771
thinking about prevention is this because it is and

3232
02:24:57,771 --> 02:24:59,390
prevent but what is prevention

3233
02:24:59,390 --> 02:25:01,700
prevention is paying attention to training here

3234
02:25:01,700 --> 02:25:04,070
during this door talks we have given

3235
02:25:04,070 --> 02:25:06,140
many credits during the other

3236
02:25:06,140 --> 02:25:09,000
talks of walkers one more technical

3237
02:25:09,000 --> 02:25:11,340
but we have talked about many things and

3238
02:25:11,340 --> 02:25:13,380
daily we see many of those who

3239
02:25:13,380 --> 02:25:15,480
They say that there because if not what will

3240
02:25:15,480 --> 02:25:17,250
pass we will have to talk about

3241
02:25:17,250 --> 02:25:20,790
certain protection that they exist and must be

3242
02:25:20,790 --> 02:25:22,380
talk about restitution of rights has

3243
02:25:22,380 --> 02:25:24,000
to see if there are backups that

3244
02:25:24,000 --> 02:25:27,680
when we could have stayed here

3245
02:25:27,680 --> 02:25:31,149
that prevention are three little things that he left

3246
02:25:31,149 --> 02:25:33,410
no responsibility is greater than

3247
02:25:33,410 --> 02:25:35,029
another my message

3248
02:25:35,029 --> 02:25:37,210
I always say these three things

3249
02:25:37,210 --> 02:25:39,290
responsibility we have to be

3250
02:25:39,290 --> 02:25:41,510
responsible for our old lady not to throw away

3251
02:25:41,510 --> 02:25:44,060
the ball is that it is the dt and it is not that

3252
02:25:44,060 --> 02:25:47,140
we don't have to be responsible

3253
02:25:47,140 --> 02:25:49,130
knowledge that what we are talking about

3254
02:25:49,130 --> 02:25:51,439
if the fungus learned and the famous

3255
02:25:51,439 --> 02:25:54,069
common sense excuse me jaime

3256
02:25:54,069 --> 02:25:57,229
excuse me yesterday also to alejandro that

3257
02:25:57,229 --> 02:25:58,790
they talked about the adult they talked about

3258
02:25:58,790 --> 02:26:01,790
dragonball but here he used it a long time ago

3259
02:26:01,790 --> 02:26:03,979
knight of the zodiac because he spoke

3260
02:26:03,979 --> 02:26:06,500
the seventh sense must be awakened

3261
02:26:06,500 --> 02:26:08,600
common sense that we all have asleep

3262
02:26:08,600 --> 02:26:11,390
but how do we realize that it is

3263
02:26:11,390 --> 02:26:13,910
failing the sense as it does not serve by itself

3264
02:26:13,910 --> 02:26:16,250
only common sense is dynamic does

3265
02:26:16,250 --> 02:26:18,949
a few years we thought that feeling like

3266
02:26:18,949 --> 02:26:20,660
tells us that the keys must have eight

3267
02:26:20,660 --> 02:26:22,850
digit winds today we have to

3268
02:26:22,850 --> 02:26:25,069
think keys must be a lot

3269
02:26:25,069 --> 02:26:26,750
older than we should have a second

3270
02:26:26,750 --> 02:26:29,239
true third factor authentication

3271
02:26:29,239 --> 02:26:31,789
but if we are sharing the key

3272
02:26:31,789 --> 02:26:34,699
under a bridge this is non-digital

3273
02:26:34,699 --> 02:26:37,639
when is the bridge please stop

3274
02:26:37,639 --> 02:26:40,309
and think for a moment about life we ​​already see

3275
02:26:40,309 --> 02:26:42,349
this to digital life and we have the

3276
02:26:42,349 --> 02:26:44,599
daring to fight the one in the taxi that almost

3277
02:26:44,599 --> 02:26:47,179
we are run over by exchange en off when for

3278
02:26:47,179 --> 02:26:49,249
favor is our responsibility or the

3279
02:26:49,249 --> 02:26:52,369
usb no photo shoot what if

3280
02:26:52,369 --> 02:26:54,919
we found him knows the cb on the floor

3281
02:26:54,919 --> 02:26:57,559
Well, I could go on about more things.

3282
02:26:57,559 --> 02:27:01,189
I simply leave these readings more

3283
02:27:01,189 --> 02:27:03,919
recommended require learning because

3284
02:27:03,919 --> 02:27:06,289
Well, the celebrities we live in thought

3285
02:27:06,289 --> 02:27:08,689
that television is a way to

3286
02:27:08,689 --> 02:27:11,239
start of the hacker world there are many of

3287
02:27:11,239 --> 02:27:12,859
the interesting seriously what it calls

3288
02:27:12,859 --> 02:27:15,489
hatton with social engineering we can

3289
02:27:15,489 --> 02:27:17,869
having a library for any

3290
02:27:17,869 --> 02:27:19,579
staff who can learn some

3291
02:27:19,579 --> 02:27:22,249
little things some not very technical and yes

3292
02:27:22,249 --> 02:27:24,649
He wants to get into a topic a little more

3293
02:27:24,649 --> 02:27:27,139
strong understand the nature of being

3294
02:27:27,139 --> 02:27:29,989
Human, well, Daniel Kahneman is from

3295
02:27:29,989 --> 02:27:31,939
think fast think of space we

3296
02:27:31,939 --> 02:27:33,979
talk about the two brains it takes

3297
02:27:33,979 --> 02:27:35,809
decisions and think about it

3298
02:27:35,809 --> 02:27:38,149
intuitively or the reflection of

3299
02:27:38,149 --> 02:27:40,399
that is very good and sant control new

3300
02:27:40,399 --> 02:27:43,039
what is called noise how does it affect in

3301
02:27:43,039 --> 02:27:45,559
our decisions in the newspaper by

3302
02:27:45,559 --> 02:27:49,069
Also if you want to see the art of

3303
02:27:49,069 --> 02:27:50,329
leg but what is there one that I

3304
02:27:50,329 --> 02:27:51,859
I recommend that you love the art of deception

3305
02:27:51,859 --> 02:27:54,679
what is explaining the art of war

3306
02:27:54,679 --> 02:27:57,589
applied in decision making

3307
02:27:57,589 --> 02:27:59,989
I leave this last image for you

3308
02:27:59,989 --> 02:28:02,389
let's reflect I think it says synthesize

3309
02:28:02,389 --> 02:28:05,359
all the talk there is nothing to do with

3310
02:28:05,359 --> 02:28:06,879
responsibility

3311
02:28:06,879 --> 02:28:11,539
knowledge and common sense I hope

3312
02:28:11,539 --> 02:28:13,879
you liked the talk thank you very much

3313
02:28:13,879 --> 02:28:15,039
by your attention

3314
02:28:15,039 --> 02:28:18,349
thanks to all the people thanks to

3315
02:28:18,349 --> 02:28:20,959
So thanks to the community for all the

3316
02:28:20,959 --> 02:28:24,200
support and good

3317
02:28:24,200 --> 02:28:27,080
to you louis thank you very much we have

3318
02:28:27,080 --> 02:28:30,320
obviously some questions we are going to

3319
02:28:30,320 --> 02:28:32,980
go for those who have more

3320
02:28:32,980 --> 02:28:35,391
likes in the question system that

3321
02:28:35,391 --> 02:28:37,910
we have designed and the first question

3322
02:28:37,910 --> 02:28:41,630
is anonymous and says that techniques and

3323
02:28:41,630 --> 02:28:43,280
tactics and procedures used

3324
02:28:43,280 --> 02:28:47,230
for the expression of false news

3325
02:28:47,439 --> 02:28:49,539
well I guess there are many people

3326
02:28:49,539 --> 02:28:52,180
what are you hearing notice me techniques

3327
02:28:52,180 --> 02:28:53,979
so what is there to do

3328
02:28:53,979 --> 02:28:56,140
first it depends where they come from

3329
02:28:56,140 --> 02:28:57,670
news and be a facebook-like network

3330
02:28:57,670 --> 02:29:00,789
let's check the messages there are people who

3331
02:29:00,789 --> 02:29:02,590
they don't talk anymore it's that it's clear it's

3332
02:29:02,590 --> 02:29:04,989
spacious came out a while ago it's just that

3333
02:29:04,989 --> 02:29:07,050
we are lazy to carry out the messages

3334
02:29:07,050 --> 02:29:09,609
second usually a fake news

3335
02:29:09,609 --> 02:29:12,999
is in a medium a social network

3336
02:29:12,999 --> 02:29:14,949
then let's verify that news with

3337
02:29:14,949 --> 02:29:17,109
other media such as a newspaper or

3338
02:29:17,109 --> 02:29:20,039
velinas digital newspaper in the

3339
02:29:20,039 --> 02:29:22,119
hiring what makes us

3340
02:29:22,119 --> 02:29:25,300
need to contrast verify and it is not

3341
02:29:25,300 --> 02:29:27,369
complex is simply entering others

3342
02:29:27,369 --> 02:29:30,279
media and check if that is real because

3343
02:29:30,279 --> 02:29:32,470
I access the news up to date and there are some

3344
02:29:32,470 --> 02:29:35,140
that impact and the false news depends

3345
02:29:35,140 --> 02:29:38,109
of the moment, that is, right now, Qatar is coming and

3346
02:29:38,109 --> 02:29:40,359
there will be a lot of news right now we are

3347
02:29:40,359 --> 02:29:41,949
in time see here in colombia

3348
02:29:41,949 --> 02:29:43,840
tax return and there is a lot

3349
02:29:43,840 --> 02:29:45,130
News

3350
02:29:45,130 --> 02:29:47,380
recently one also came out of edict of

3351
02:29:47,380 --> 02:29:49,630
an attack deletes you have to verify that

3352
02:29:49,630 --> 02:29:51,970
kinds of things through other means

3353
02:29:51,970 --> 02:29:55,300
let's not stay with the pretty photo with

3354
02:29:55,300 --> 02:29:57,700
the alert sign as the words of

3355
02:29:57,700 --> 02:30:00,130
urgent loosening time etc.

3356
02:30:00,130 --> 02:30:02,700
because that's what you're looking for

3357
02:30:02,700 --> 02:30:06,939
that there is another that is said that if he had

3358
02:30:06,939 --> 02:30:09,580
the possibility of sending you a fragment of

3359
02:30:09,580 --> 02:30:11,800
video for people over 60

3360
02:30:11,800 --> 02:30:13,360
so they don't screw up on the internet

3361
02:30:13,360 --> 02:30:15,700
that I would send this to him, they are going to cut it and

3362
02:30:15,700 --> 02:30:17,470
then send by whatsapp everywhere

3363
02:30:17,470 --> 02:30:22,180
then think about the message and with this

3364
02:30:22,180 --> 02:30:24,700
answer we say goodbye well then the

3365
02:30:24,700 --> 02:30:26,229
I really think that people more

3366
02:30:26,229 --> 02:30:28,960
since 2020 we have noticed this

3367
02:30:28,960 --> 02:30:31,090
trend as older people

3368
02:30:31,090 --> 02:30:33,160
they are commenting more and more because

3369
02:30:33,160 --> 02:30:34,720
Well now the birthdays with the

3370
02:30:34,720 --> 02:30:37,450
grandparents is between blue and let's

3371
02:30:37,450 --> 02:30:39,250
get together and we're just like

3372
02:30:39,250 --> 02:30:41,080
There were almost seven cameras in Bogotá

3373
02:30:41,080 --> 02:30:43,180
another in other countries and all celebrating

3374
02:30:43,180 --> 02:30:45,010
the birthday of the grandparents of what you

3375
02:30:45,010 --> 02:30:47,890
cousin here they know how to do it

3376
02:30:47,890 --> 02:30:49,930
I think that more than grandparents is

3377
02:30:49,930 --> 02:30:53,529
having young children is ours

3378
02:30:53,529 --> 02:30:56,439
responsibility to help them yes

3379
02:30:56,439 --> 02:31:00,370
because because they are yes or we are not

3380
02:31:00,370 --> 02:31:02,229
as a son I have to be aware of

3381
02:31:02,229 --> 02:31:04,989
my parents I am something of this and I am not

3382
02:31:04,989 --> 02:31:07,060
easy knowing that my mom until

3383
02:31:07,060 --> 02:31:08,949
share the all interest in whatsapp

3384
02:31:08,949 --> 02:31:11,080
how is waiting then i have to

3385
02:31:11,080 --> 02:31:12,670
be every day saying eye yes

3386
02:31:12,670 --> 02:31:16,109
you get this if so if you

3387
02:31:16,109 --> 02:31:20,500
grandparents ask their children to help their

3388
02:31:20,500 --> 02:31:23,350
grandchildren is more integrated is of all that

3389
02:31:23,350 --> 02:31:26,020
we talk about this is so not because it is the

3390
02:31:26,020 --> 02:31:28,870
it is up to them that they depend

3391
02:31:28,870 --> 02:31:30,460
we can guide them and they can

3392

02:33:28,309 --> 02:33:32,739
fast and a local feeling

3435
02:33:32,739 --> 02:33:35,709
even in the google bp program that

3436
02:33:35,709 --> 02:33:37,149
It's basically the program

3437
02:33:37,149 --> 02:33:41,289
google rewards a brief

3438
02:33:41,289 --> 02:33:44,279
biography my name is omar espino

3439
02:33:44,279 --> 02:33:47,470
known in networks as el espino I'm from

3440
02:33:47,470 --> 02:33:50,009
mexico for the

3441
02:33:50,009 --> 02:33:52,510
morning

3442
02:33:52,510 --> 02:33:54,300
Work as

3443
02:33:54,300 --> 02:33:56,740
infrastructure security manager no

3444
02:33:56,740 --> 02:33:58,660
I know if we are going tracks a US company

3445
02:33:58,660 --> 02:34:01,890
that you have to have to in mexico

3446
02:34:01,920 --> 02:34:04,670
I'm going grones

3447
02:34:04,670 --> 02:34:06,260
and that I really like everything it has

3448
02:34:06,260 --> 02:34:08,450
what to do with unix and linux in the

3449
02:34:08,450 --> 02:34:10,310
terminals or all type systems

3450
02:34:10,310 --> 02:34:13,370
I like linux a lot before it was

3451
02:34:13,370 --> 02:34:15,800
and back in developer and it was also

3452
02:34:15,800 --> 02:34:17,920
motionless to see it but right now it is

3453
02:34:17,920 --> 02:34:20,330
security issue that does not end by

3454
02:34:20,330 --> 02:34:22,520
the day at night is a researcher of

3455
02:34:22,520 --> 02:34:25,210
independent diplomatic security and

3456
02:34:25,210 --> 02:34:28,580
I am also a book counter for

3457
02:34:28,580 --> 02:34:30,170
people who are watching us who are not

3458
02:34:30,170 --> 02:34:31,460
you know it's a book counter

3459
02:34:31,460 --> 02:34:33,590
basically a person who is dedicated to

3460
02:34:33,590 --> 02:34:36,350
look for faults in companies that offer

3461
02:34:36,350 --> 02:34:38,479
mainly rewards programs

3462
02:34:38,479 --> 02:34:41,090
coin the money in the reward but

3463
02:34:41,090 --> 02:34:42,760
there is also another type of reward

3464
02:34:42,760 --> 02:34:45,110
I have my personal blog or the hawthorn

3465
02:34:45,110 --> 02:34:49,550
dotcom my twitter is today month came and

3466
02:34:49,550 --> 02:34:52,210
some brief milestones

3467
02:34:52,210 --> 02:34:55,950
and published in the blog of chema alonso

3468
02:34:55,950 --> 02:34:59,770
informal already has enough time

3469
02:34:59,770 --> 02:35:01,840
I did a minute on how to run seal the

3470
02:35:01,840 --> 02:35:05,320
hay sx in the bow bears just called

3471
02:35:05,320 --> 02:35:09,610
saw and gave him what he posted on his blog and

3472
02:35:09,610 --> 02:35:12,640
I have been recognized thinking the way

3473
02:35:12,640 --> 02:35:14,680
some companies like facebook google

3474
02:35:14,680 --> 02:35:17,650
apple microsoft

3475
02:35:17,650 --> 02:35:20,490
twitter among others

3476
02:35:20,960 --> 02:35:25,550
good very good finally I'm recently

3477
02:35:25,550 --> 02:35:28,550
this year he published a book basically is

3478
02:35:28,550 --> 02:35:30,890
a compilation of failures that I have

3479
02:35:30,890 --> 02:35:32,530
found at

3480
02:35:32,530 --> 02:35:35,761
throughout my time that I have carried

3481
02:35:35,761 --> 02:35:39,221
my book counter career and what

3482
02:35:39,221 --> 02:35:41,080
important or special about this book

3483
02:35:41,080 --> 02:35:42,761
is that it is in Spanish regularly almost

3484
02:35:42,761 --> 02:35:45,000
all the information is in english

3485
02:35:45,000 --> 02:35:47,261
So that's why I was encouraged because several

3486
02:35:47,261 --> 02:35:48,670
thinking and they ask if he had something

3487
02:35:48,670 --> 02:35:50,650
in Spanish because they knew it was in

3488
02:35:50,650 --> 02:35:53,410
Mexico then there is the book

3489
02:35:53,410 --> 02:35:54,910
available on amazon is called bug bounty

3490
02:35:54,910 --> 02:35:58,511
in Spanish it is in digital and it is in the

3491
02:35:58,511 --> 02:36:01,150
but in my blog there are also the

3492
02:36:01,150 --> 02:36:02,720
links to

3493
02:36:02,720 --> 02:36:04,500
to buy the book

3494
02:36:04,500 --> 02:36:08,040
very well although the agenda of this

3495
02:36:08,040 --> 02:36:11,070
talk is first an introduction of

3496
02:36:11,070 --> 02:36:13,440
what is the bug bounty motivations yes

3497
02:36:13,440 --> 02:36:15,960
that and then I'm going to share my

3498
02:36:15,960 --> 02:36:18,430
methodology

3499
02:36:18,430 --> 02:36:20,979
In a simplified way, what happened?

3500
02:36:20,979 --> 02:36:24,040
to find this kind of bugs

3501
02:36:24,040 --> 02:36:24,960
which

3502
02:36:24,960 --> 02:36:27,359
includes as the

3503
02:36:27,359 --> 02:36:30,970
Let's say the visualization of the

3504
02:36:30,970 --> 02:36:33,569
overall organization

3505
02:36:33,569 --> 02:36:36,390
names of their domains

3506
02:36:36,390 --> 02:36:39,790
visual identification a little strong

3507
02:36:39,790 --> 02:36:43,410
gross and web scraping and then already

3508
02:36:43,410 --> 02:36:45,430
specifically the steps

3509
02:36:45,430 --> 02:36:47,120
followed

3510
02:36:47,120 --> 02:36:49,130
to find a bug that I put

3511
02:36:49,130 --> 02:36:51,250
relevant to google

3512
02:36:51,250 --> 02:36:53,360
things that come after

3513
02:36:53,360 --> 02:36:55,230
you find a bug

3514
02:36:55,230 --> 02:36:57,690
and then also the lessons learned

3515
02:36:57,690 --> 02:37:01,500
of all this let's say experiment process

3516
02:37:01,500 --> 02:37:03,961
that at the end questions and answers

3517
02:37:03,961 --> 02:37:06,801
aesthetic

3518
02:37:07,430 --> 02:37:11,010
before starting this information is

3519
02:37:11,010 --> 02:37:13,260
for educational purposes only

3520
02:37:13,260 --> 02:37:15,990
professionals and in this case my dragon

3521
02:37:15,990 --> 02:37:19,140
jarni and I take responsibility for

3522
02:37:19,140 --> 02:37:23,000
of the use of this information

3523
02:37:23,870 --> 02:37:28,530
very good first the introduction

3524
02:37:28,530 --> 02:37:32,190
because he is looking for what is behind

3525
02:37:32,190 --> 02:37:34,980
of the idea of ​​being a singer in the

3526
02:37:34,980 --> 02:37:39,271
Personally, the challenge motivates me a lot.

3527
02:37:39,271 --> 02:37:41,181
that many who are here with us

3528
02:37:41,181 --> 02:37:45,430
the challenge is one of the main things

3529
02:37:45,430 --> 02:37:47,439
it is very fun to understand how

3530
02:37:47,439 --> 02:37:50,279
computers communicate and depending

3531
02:37:50,279 --> 02:37:52,540
the processes or intentions that

3532
02:37:52,540 --> 02:37:55,359
have can good to have your results

3533
02:37:55,359 --> 02:37:57,910
sometimes unexpected so I think it's

3534
02:37:57,910 --> 02:37:59,560
something that we share many who are

3535
02:37:59,560 --> 02:38:00,760
exist in this conference that

3536
02:38:00,760 --> 02:38:03,040
probably is

3537
02:38:03,040 --> 02:38:07,060
share that that with me and in addition to

3538
02:38:07,060 --> 02:38:08,771
all that because there are profits

3539
02:38:08,771 --> 02:38:11,230
money involved but it

3540
02:38:11,230 --> 02:38:14,380
main thing for me is the challenge and that

3541
02:38:14,380 --> 02:38:16,690
it all seems very funny very funny

3542
02:38:16,690 --> 02:38:19,900
this about how to manipulate computers

3543
02:38:19,900 --> 02:38:24,490
to get where expected

3544
02:38:24,490 --> 02:38:27,480
ok hey

3545
02:38:27,480 --> 02:38:30,940
Broadly speaking, the methodology

3546
02:38:30,940 --> 02:38:34,931
used or what you are using is

3547
02:38:34,931 --> 02:38:37,510
first as the discovery of

3548
02:38:37,510 --> 02:38:39,730
organization in global or simply

3549
02:38:39,730 --> 02:38:41,490
fetch

3550
02:38:41,490 --> 02:38:45,221
the scope of the program or the rules of the

3551
02:38:45,221 --> 02:38:47,351
program but the mind is called

3552
02:38:47,351 --> 02:38:49,740
bug bounty program rules

3553
02:38:49,740 --> 02:38:50,949
[Applause]

3554
02:38:50,949 --> 02:38:53,949
after that we will choose a domain

3555
02:38:53,949 --> 02:38:56,499
in which we are going to do our

3556
02:38:56,499 --> 02:38:59,770
tests and also a main network in

3557
02:38:59,770 --> 02:39:01,449
this case is a sn

3558
02:39:01,449 --> 02:39:03,520
I will elaborate a little more in detail

3559
02:39:03,520 --> 02:39:06,479
next the following slides true

3560
02:39:06,479 --> 02:39:09,609
but basically that's it first we have

3561
02:39:09,609 --> 02:39:12,969
a domain to which we are going to try to

3562
02:39:12,969 --> 02:39:16,299
look for subdomain or let's try

3563
02:39:16,299 --> 02:39:18,939
see that your domains has the domain

3564
02:39:18,939 --> 02:39:21,180
principal

3565
02:39:21,180 --> 02:39:24,149
that if he is alive he is domain to say

3566
02:39:24,149 --> 02:39:26,069
I have a list of x number domains

3567
02:39:26,069 --> 02:39:27,899
and check if the domain is

3568
02:39:27,899 --> 02:39:30,540
answering and it's worth it and continue

3569
02:39:30,540 --> 02:39:31,340
inquiring

3570
02:39:31,340 --> 02:39:33,960
then you have to make a notice

3571
02:39:33,960 --> 02:39:36,270
visual identification which is basically

3572
02:39:36,270 --> 02:39:39,050
take screenshots decade

3573
02:39:39,050 --> 02:39:41,510
of each subdomain that we find that

3574
02:39:41,510 --> 02:39:45,020
is alive and from there

3575
02:39:45,020 --> 02:39:46,810
already with one

3576
02:39:46,810 --> 02:39:49,970
look more reduced we could already do

3577
02:39:49,970 --> 02:39:52,670
brute force or power attacks is

3578
02:39:52,670 --> 02:39:55,430
phil is on the domains side of the

3579
02:39:55,430 --> 02:39:57,079
net side

3580
02:39:57,079 --> 02:39:59,239
what we can do is identify what

3581
02:39:59,239 --> 02:40:01,759
network blocks has the organization a

3582
02:40:01,759 --> 02:40:03,609
port scanning

3583
02:40:03,609 --> 02:40:06,169
same as domains see if alive

3584
02:40:06,169 --> 02:40:08,359
which live which ports are live or what

3585
02:40:08,359 --> 02:40:11,329
ports are responding and already starting

3586
02:40:11,329 --> 02:40:12,399
from there

3587
02:40:12,399 --> 02:40:14,449
identify the services that are

3588
02:40:14,449 --> 02:40:18,139
they are running on this sports link and

3589
02:40:18,139 --> 02:40:20,739
once we found

3590
02:40:20,739 --> 02:40:23,119
all these patterns can be re-

3591
02:40:23,119 --> 02:40:25,310
repeat the process let's not say that

3592
02:40:25,310 --> 02:40:27,979
we found an interesting subdomain

3593
02:40:27,979 --> 02:40:30,079
we could replicate and revisit this

3594
02:40:30,079 --> 02:40:33,520
methodology again and throw it away

3595
02:40:33,520 --> 02:40:36,859
for this particular case of the failure

3596
02:40:36,859 --> 02:40:38,509
that I am going to talk to you specifically about if

3597
02:40:38,509 --> 02:40:41,289
I say part 1 of the methodology

3598
02:40:41,289 --> 02:40:43,369
I probably see it like this in two parts

3599
02:40:43,369 --> 02:40:44,989
not the domains part and the

3600
02:40:44,989 --> 02:40:46,050
network

3601
02:40:46,050 --> 02:40:48,490
in this case only

3602
02:40:48,490 --> 02:40:52,240
uses the part of the domains

3603
02:40:52,240 --> 02:40:53,940
per se

3604
02:40:53,940 --> 02:40:57,580
but well let's focus now yes

3605
02:40:57,580 --> 02:40:58,931
in what would become a branch

3606
02:40:58,931 --> 02:41:01,249
google rewards

3607
02:41:01,249 --> 02:41:03,619
to take him as an example and show them the

3608
02:41:03,619 --> 02:41:06,199
glitch that was quite interesting

3609
02:41:06,199 --> 02:41:08,089
the google reward program google

3610
02:41:08,089 --> 02:41:09,439
it's called google

3611
02:41:09,439 --> 02:41:14,349
brp pues vulnerability we work program

3612
02:41:14,349 --> 02:41:17,209
basically they pay you from 100 to

3613
02:41:17,209 --> 02:41:20,449
31 thousand 367 dollars depending on the

3614
02:41:20,449 --> 02:41:22,969
impact of vulnerability that

3615
02:41:22,969 --> 02:41:27,079
you have found and it is accessed with this

3616
02:41:27,079 --> 02:41:30,169
url is not cut sends you directly to

3617
02:41:30,169 --> 02:41:32,139
or program rules

3618
02:41:32,139 --> 02:41:34,770
basically the program

3619
02:41:34,770 --> 02:41:35,939
[Music]

3620
02:41:35,939 --> 02:41:38,279
consists of three domains

3621
02:41:38,279 --> 02:41:39,899
main that is the one of google.com

3622
02:41:39,899 --> 02:41:44,550
youtube.com and blogger.com even though

3623
02:41:44,550 --> 02:41:46,260
there are only three of google is a company

3624
02:41:46,260 --> 02:41:48,959
very old and therefore has has

3625
02:41:48,959 --> 02:41:51,859
many a domain in fact never

3626
02:41:51,859 --> 02:41:54,850
I never eat

3627
02:41:54,850 --> 02:41:57,880
How do you say no, I haven't done all the

3628
02:41:57,880 --> 02:42:00,369
job of doing all the discovery

3629
02:42:00,369 --> 02:42:01,830
of all goods because it is a sea of

3630
02:42:01,830 --> 02:42:04,830
information

3631
02:42:05,660 --> 02:42:11,891
and for the network blocks, that is, of the sl

3632
02:42:12,740 --> 02:42:15,521
they are around 9 million ip

3633
02:42:15,521 --> 02:42:18,380
basically the s in that are the blocks

3634
02:42:18,380 --> 02:42:21,410
network that the google company registers

3635
02:42:21,410 --> 02:42:24,530
on the internet as belonging to their

3636
02:42:24,530 --> 02:42:28,250
services and their and their networks and then

3637
02:42:28,250 --> 02:42:30,920
yes yes it is enough information it is not

3638
02:42:30,920 --> 02:42:36,250
exaggerated let's say and overwhelming all the

3639
02:42:36,250 --> 02:42:39,010
how it was made

3640
02:42:39,010 --> 02:42:41,110
the amount of

3641
02:42:41,110 --> 02:42:45,280
to do or objects that google has

3642
02:42:45,280 --> 02:42:47,801
to test not then the question the

3643
02:42:47,801 --> 02:42:50,870
first question is where to start

3644
02:42:50,870 --> 02:42:53,601
where to start then I'm going to

3645
02:42:53,601 --> 02:42:55,090
share how was my

3646
02:42:55,090 --> 02:42:58,730
reasoning first as is google

3647
02:42:58,730 --> 02:43:02,210
My idea was, well, I'm going to take google.com

3648
02:43:02,210 --> 02:43:05,630
is what you are most familiar with

3649
02:43:05,630 --> 02:43:09,460
and from there I would start with a

3650
02:43:09,460 --> 02:43:11,810
aggressive methodology to call it

3651
02:43:11,810 --> 02:43:14,660
a certain guy let's give a name to

3652
02:43:14,660 --> 02:43:16,640
greece cause i mean i'm gonna

3653
02:43:16,640 --> 02:43:18,620
be like there is trying this

3654
02:43:18,620 --> 02:43:20,020
interaction directly with the

3655
02:43:20,020 --> 02:43:23,320
google servers

3656
02:43:24,200 --> 02:43:26,630
save some time too

3657
02:43:26,630 --> 02:43:29,301
I was analyzing

3658
02:43:29,301 --> 02:43:31,311
and certain environments that are usually

3659
02:43:31,311 --> 02:43:33,771
deploy in companies such as

3660
02:43:33,771 --> 02:43:35,890
example

3661
02:43:35,890 --> 02:43:39,819
by dot google.com from google.com

3662
02:43:39,819 --> 02:43:42,790
development point google.com stay in

3663
02:43:42,790 --> 02:43:47,800
admin alpha beta local test etc.

3664
02:43:47,800 --> 02:43:49,720
people who are familiar with the

3665
02:43:49,720 --> 02:43:50,880
software development or

3666
02:43:50,880 --> 02:43:53,529
infrastructures will know that they are that they are

3667
02:43:53,529 --> 02:43:55,810
sub are words that often use

3668
02:43:55,810 --> 02:43:58,330
for non-environment subdomains

3669
02:43:58,330 --> 02:44:02,859
of production then I had already seen

3670
02:44:02,859 --> 02:44:05,800
quite the dépor google.com on the internet

3671
02:44:05,800 --> 02:44:08,800
like that suddenly and he was the one who called me the

3672
02:44:08,800 --> 02:44:12,090
attention then to cut the let's say

3673
02:44:12,090 --> 02:44:16,750
to focus and shorten more to the sight

3674
02:44:16,750 --> 02:44:20,050
the one that selects was the sport

3675
02:44:20,050 --> 02:44:22,989
because it sounds more corporate and for

3676
02:44:22,989 --> 02:44:24,970
therefore they are what they use the

3677
02:44:24,970 --> 02:44:26,920
people internally is not

3678
02:44:26,920 --> 02:44:29,729
basically what i did was

3679
02:44:29,729 --> 02:44:32,229
do a brute force attack with

3680
02:44:32,229 --> 02:44:34,050
a tool seen more works and more

3681
02:44:34,050 --> 02:44:35,970
estate

3682
02:44:35,970 --> 02:44:41,040
combined with the word list of a

3683
02:44:41,040 --> 02:44:44,250
liar called ya ya dix this one ya dix

3684
02:44:44,250 --> 02:44:46,950
he is a super master of recognition

3685
02:44:46,950 --> 02:44:50,329
well-known bounty hunter

3686
02:44:50,329 --> 02:44:53,300
and what happened is that he

3687
02:44:53,300 --> 02:44:56,560
together with all the dictionaries of

3688
02:44:56,560 --> 02:45:00,170
tools similar to ls

3689
02:45:00,170 --> 02:45:04,030
and that they were public for example

3690
02:45:04,101 --> 02:45:05,670
d

3691
02:45:05,670 --> 02:45:08,189
the next tv etc. a number of

3692
02:45:08,189 --> 02:45:09,960
tools that have their lists

3693
02:45:09,960 --> 02:45:11,910
dictionaries and all together

3694
02:45:11,910 --> 02:45:13,439
complete all lists all

3695
02:45:13,439 --> 02:45:15,540
words related to discovery

3696
02:45:15,540 --> 02:45:17,550
of energy that found the with a single

3697
02:45:17,550 --> 02:45:20,189
file and made it public on the host and

3698
02:45:20,189 --> 02:45:24,240
is this the height of txt 2

3699
02:45:24,240 --> 02:45:26,550
basically with that he was attacked

3700
02:45:26,550 --> 02:45:28,229
brute force all combinations

3701
02:45:28,229 --> 02:45:30,150
what can there be for word point the

3702
02:45:30,150 --> 02:45:33,020
dotcom let's say asterisk dot

3703
02:45:33,020 --> 02:45:35,560
google.com.uk dotcom

3704
02:45:35,560 --> 02:45:38,100
Y

3705
02:45:38,210 --> 02:45:41,530
they were around 22

3706
02:45:41,530 --> 02:45:44,560
million requests in

3707
02:45:44,560 --> 02:45:47,390
three minutes or so all this with

3708
02:45:47,390 --> 02:45:49,779
A server

3709
02:45:49,800 --> 02:45:53,740
relatively small is a pps of 2

3710
02:45:53,740 --> 02:45:55,910
gigabytes of ram and a cpu

3711
02:45:55,910 --> 02:45:56,020
[Applause]

3712
02:45:56,020 --> 02:45:57,370
[Music]

3713
02:45:57,370 --> 02:45:59,710
and it was quite the many fast ones, no

3714
02:45:59,710 --> 02:46:01,561
same the

3715
02:46:01,561 --> 02:46:04,780
It is important to think about how you use the

3716
02:46:04,780 --> 02:46:08,340
methodology, tools and

3717
02:46:08,340 --> 02:46:10,920
let's say and the

3718
02:46:10,920 --> 02:46:13,210
commands and everyone don't worry right now

3719
02:46:13,210 --> 02:46:14,561
do not think about this I am going to share

3720
02:46:14,561 --> 02:46:18,240
anyway the rendering

3721
02:46:18,240 --> 02:46:21,000
something important and tell each other the focus of

3722
02:46:21,000 --> 02:46:23,910
the talk is that previously before

3723
02:46:23,910 --> 02:46:27,540
use his gross and more goods he used

3724
02:46:27,540 --> 02:46:29,221
other tools calling dyn

3725
02:46:29,221 --> 02:46:32,431
goods to provide and buster these

3726
02:46:32,431 --> 02:46:34,141
tools with the same dictionary

3727
02:46:34,141 --> 02:46:37,561
what is golf txt lasts around

3728
02:46:37,561 --> 02:46:40,200
30 minutes then what I started to

3729
02:46:40,200 --> 02:46:43,110
search was therefore some tools that

3730
02:46:43,110 --> 02:46:45,931
they were or that they were that they had

3731
02:46:45,931 --> 02:46:49,090
more the same as 6

3732
02:46:49,090 --> 02:46:51,370
features but achieves a little more

3733
02:46:51,370 --> 02:46:54,479
fast that's how I say

3734
02:46:54,479 --> 02:46:57,131
as I told you

3735
02:46:57,131 --> 02:46:59,341
because you are the combination of

3736
02:46:59,341 --> 02:47:04,271
ns and de resource dictionaries

3737
02:47:04,271 --> 02:47:07,561
gene numbering tools

3738
02:47:08,020 --> 02:47:10,300
starting well that's the first

3739
02:47:10,300 --> 02:47:13,979
let's say the first part of the

3740
02:47:13,979 --> 02:47:16,869
discovery of their domains that was

3741
02:47:16,869 --> 02:47:18,939
the aggressive one now there is also a way to

3742
02:47:18,939 --> 02:47:20,949
get those subdomains so

3743
02:47:20,949 --> 02:47:23,220
passive

3744
02:47:24,051 --> 02:47:26,570
there is a seeker named adam

3745
02:47:26,570 --> 02:47:28,251
probably most of here know

3746
02:47:28,251 --> 02:47:31,241
that they give but for those who do not know

3747
02:47:31,241 --> 02:47:33,801
basically jordan is like the brother

3748
02:47:33,801 --> 02:47:37,521
lesser bad cousin a bad cousin

3749
02:47:37,521 --> 02:47:41,340
from google is a search engine that

3750
02:47:41,340 --> 02:47:44,330
current, that is, it is constantly

3751
02:47:44,330 --> 02:47:47,310
showing services published in

3752
02:47:47,310 --> 02:47:49,229
internet and concert intros you can

3753
02:47:49,229 --> 02:47:51,479
getting information is enough

3754
02:47:51,479 --> 02:47:54,750
interesting we will be talking more

3755
02:47:54,750 --> 02:47:57,170
up there in the following spots

3756
02:47:57,170 --> 02:48:00,479
basically passively you with a

3757
02:48:00,479 --> 02:48:02,700
filter in sudan or in his mike that

3758
02:48:02,700 --> 02:48:04,170
It's basically a very useful tool.

3759
02:48:04,170 --> 02:48:08,070
similar but blue

3760
02:48:08,070 --> 02:48:10,580
you can add 2 point scl filter

3761
02:48:10,580 --> 02:48:13,710
and the subdomain we are looking for is

3762
02:48:13,710 --> 02:48:15,601
the one we select from cutting

3763
02:48:15,601 --> 02:48:19,301
google.com or even the host name

3764
02:48:19,301 --> 02:48:23,370
and that will show you servers

3765
02:48:23,370 --> 02:48:26,930
and probably with its sub domains of

3766
02:48:26,930 --> 02:48:29,790
that contains this this sub domínguez and

3767
02:48:29,790 --> 02:48:31,400
not

3768
02:48:31,400 --> 02:48:34,850
there is also

3769
02:48:35,051 --> 02:48:37,360
another search engine similar to the one called

3770
02:48:37,360 --> 02:48:39,900
binary dot i

3771
02:48:39,900 --> 02:48:42,881
or even on github too that is if

3772
02:48:42,881 --> 02:48:45,881
we put in github in addition and in combine

3773
02:48:45,881 --> 02:48:48,400
and in the subdomain as it can

3774
02:48:48,400 --> 02:48:51,341
return information related to that

3775
02:48:51,341 --> 02:48:53,710
domain and its domains

3776
02:48:53,710 --> 02:48:56,820
let's say linked to this without domain no

3777
02:48:56,820 --> 02:48:59,200
there is another tool that is also

3778
02:48:59,200 --> 02:49:01,479
a certificate search engine that is the

3779
02:49:01,479 --> 02:49:03,750
cis

3780
02:49:04,660 --> 02:49:06,820
here is the filter same as the one

3781
02:49:06,820 --> 02:49:09,521
presentation will be shared but the

3782
02:49:09,521 --> 02:49:11,380
The idea is that it be a part, there is also the

3783
02:49:11,380 --> 02:49:13,630
sense tool

3784
02:49:13,630 --> 02:49:15,460
There is another tool called

3785
02:49:15,460 --> 02:49:19,360
rr.ee sh that is a place is a website

3786
02:49:19,360 --> 02:49:21,949
where are they say

3787
02:49:21,949 --> 02:49:24,499
where certificates of

3788
02:49:24,499 --> 02:49:28,069
a lot of many websites then with

3789
02:49:28,069 --> 02:49:30,020
this point of sh

3790
02:49:30,020 --> 02:49:32,270
Google is also mastered to perform

3791
02:49:32,270 --> 02:49:34,989
many related domains today

3792
02:49:34,989 --> 02:49:36,969
because they were obtained by

3793
02:49:36,969 --> 02:49:39,079
certificates

3794
02:49:39,079 --> 02:49:42,801
and one of my favorites is

3795
02:49:42,801 --> 02:49:45,291
like hacking hackers to hack their

3796
02:49:45,291 --> 02:49:46,631
hacks

3797
02:49:46,631 --> 02:49:49,551
eventually if there is someone who is

3798
02:49:49,551 --> 02:49:51,921
looking for his domains to go and about everything

3799
02:49:51,921 --> 02:49:53,991
from google will come across a list of

3800
02:49:53,991 --> 02:49:56,211
rand or a steal when wonderful is

3801
02:49:56,211 --> 02:49:59,021
another before very very good

3802
02:49:59,021 --> 02:50:02,301
and the link it hot' has all the

3803
02:50:02,301 --> 02:50:04,101
numbering that they own many

3804
02:50:04,101 --> 02:50:05,601
programs have them public in hip hop

3805
02:50:05,601 --> 02:50:08,181
then we can also take the list

3806
02:50:08,181 --> 02:50:11,751
from random robbie and add her to

3807
02:50:11,751 --> 02:50:15,471
our list of what we got in

3808
02:50:15,471 --> 02:50:19,820
all these then processes and many

3809
02:50:19,820 --> 02:50:22,491
sometimes there is work that is already done

3810
02:50:22,491 --> 02:50:24,461
by us for example in this case

3811
02:50:24,461 --> 02:50:27,261
we probably have more

3812
02:50:27,261 --> 02:50:30,501
domains but a large part of the

3813
02:50:30,501 --> 02:50:32,301
other kids are from where random robin

3814
02:50:32,301 --> 02:50:34,371
then it is also interesting to search

3815
02:50:34,371 --> 02:50:37,641
in github sometimes it can give you give

3816
02:50:37,641 --> 02:50:39,621
information is not that interesting or

3817
02:50:39,621 --> 02:50:41,241
work that someone already did because like

3818
02:50:41,241 --> 02:50:43,431
they see that together with certain

3819
02:50:43,431 --> 02:50:46,251
certain subdomains and it should be noted that

3820
02:50:46,251 --> 02:50:48,801
all this passive part, that is, all

3821
02:50:48,801 --> 02:50:51,711
the searchers or adam senn if be you lo

3822
02:50:51,711 --> 02:50:53,921
i mean random robbie

3823
02:50:53,921 --> 02:50:57,081
that information that is obtained without without

3824
02:50:57,081 --> 02:50:59,591
have contact with

3825
02:50:59,591 --> 02:51:02,240
the servers directly but

3826
02:51:02,240 --> 02:51:04,851
passively calls the aggressive part

3827
02:51:04,851 --> 02:51:06,320
it is literally testing

3828
02:51:06,320 --> 02:51:08,811
combinations one by one in the post

3829
02:51:08,811 --> 02:51:12,590
to see what comes back to us

3830
02:51:12,590 --> 02:51:16,270
ok at the end all the results

3831
02:51:16,270 --> 02:51:19,399
combined and creates a file that is

3832
02:51:19,399 --> 02:51:22,160
call by dot google.com diagonal or

3833
02:51:22,160 --> 02:51:23,740
txt

3834
02:51:23,740 --> 02:51:27,109
What does everyone have there?

3835
02:51:27,109 --> 02:51:29,060
institution all the result of all

3836
02:51:29,060 --> 02:51:32,910
is from all this exercise

3837
02:51:32,910 --> 02:51:36,010
As I mentioned there is also a part

3838
02:51:36,010 --> 02:51:39,670
that is from the network is this part of the

3839
02:51:39,670 --> 02:51:42,130
network no no was not used in this bug

3840
02:51:42,130 --> 02:51:44,730
but i think it's worth it

3841
02:51:44,730 --> 02:51:46,780
mention it and what would you have done if

3842
02:51:46,780 --> 02:51:48,460
was looking for the network blocks of

3843
02:51:48,460 --> 02:51:50,300
d

3844
02:51:50,300 --> 02:51:52,670
of Google

3845
02:51:52,670 --> 02:51:54,950
there are still two ways passive aggressive

3846
02:51:54,950 --> 02:51:57,890
in the aggressive way basically

3847
02:51:57,890 --> 02:52:00,439
registration of nextel corp google.com

3848
02:52:00,439 --> 02:52:02,550
we obtain

3849
02:52:02,550 --> 02:52:03,680
his

3850
02:52:03,680 --> 02:52:05,869
idea

3851
02:52:05,869 --> 02:52:08,640
basically it's like the network block no

3852
02:52:08,640 --> 02:52:11,881
we can we don't have domain

3853
02:52:11,881 --> 02:52:15,711
We already have the block and for example with

3854
02:52:15,711 --> 02:52:19,100
menem we can

3855
02:52:19,100 --> 02:52:21,380
Well, I had position 80, not everything is going

3856
02:52:21,380 --> 02:52:24,020
the block in this case was two thousand

3857
02:52:24,020 --> 02:52:26,170
591 host

3858
02:52:26,170 --> 02:52:28,300
Seeing that we have certain flags for

3859
02:52:28,300 --> 02:52:31,090
that for us to say that it is fast that

3860
02:52:31,090 --> 02:52:35,800
act fast not with a high king with that

3861
02:52:35,800 --> 02:52:39,780
be aggressive that avoid the pin and that's

3862
02:52:39,780 --> 02:52:42,790
2,591 houses

3863
02:52:42,790 --> 02:52:47,170
they are in two minutes only port chat

3864
02:52:47,170 --> 02:52:47,850
and

3865
02:52:47,850 --> 02:52:49,110
[Applause]

3866
02:52:49,110 --> 02:52:51,630
and how the talk increased is the

3867
02:52:51,630 --> 02:52:53,670
idea of ​​revisiting the ruling but also

3868
02:52:53,670 --> 02:52:55,500
go see how I inherited tools

3869
02:52:55,500 --> 02:52:58,760
and when doing it with more scale

3870
02:52:58,760 --> 02:53:01,340
with the same let's say similar

3871
02:53:01,340 --> 02:53:03,380
configurations not like the raid for

3872
02:53:03,380 --> 02:53:06,020
10,000 the same port the same block

3873
02:53:06,020 --> 02:53:10,250
the amount of scan host in 10

3874
02:53:10,250 --> 02:53:10,960
seconds

3875
02:53:10,960 --> 02:53:14,060
that is, if they realize 2 minutes 6

3876
02:53:14,060 --> 02:53:16,640
seconds is one yes is one quite

3877
02:53:16,640 --> 02:53:18,350
difference that's a difference

3878
02:53:18,350 --> 02:53:20,560
considerable

3879
02:53:20,560 --> 02:53:24,729
but there is a very important workshop

3880
02:53:24,729 --> 02:53:27,830
more scan is 10 times faster than the

3881
02:53:27,830 --> 02:53:32,601
sea ​​that is, there is no doubt but

3882
02:53:32,601 --> 02:53:35,841
but but but that is without more without more

3883
02:53:35,841 --> 02:53:39,831
scales very fast and in the mab it is very

3884
02:53:39,831 --> 02:53:42,910
good for fingerprint what is it

3885
02:53:42,910 --> 02:53:47,290
what do we know or do we have

3886
02:53:47,290 --> 02:53:50,320
is the port scanner for

3887
02:53:50,320 --> 02:53:53,260
fingerprinting and for all then what

3888
02:53:53,260 --> 02:53:57,780
What did I try to do instead of having one?

3889
02:53:57,780 --> 02:54:01,170
decision of one or the other

3890
02:54:01,170 --> 02:54:03,380
first with more scan

3891
02:54:03,380 --> 02:54:06,270
Scanned all the ports of the

3892
02:54:06,270 --> 02:54:07,950
blocks you have because it will be very

3893
02:54:07,950 --> 02:54:10,860
quickly and now that I detect that they are

3894
02:54:10,860 --> 02:54:14,400
live the ports now you can

3895
02:54:14,400 --> 02:54:17,390
be recognition with

3896
02:54:18,240 --> 02:54:21,090
with the motto and scan again then

3897
02:54:21,090 --> 02:54:24,440
this already gives you speed and also gives you

3898
02:54:24,440 --> 02:54:27,530
consistency there

3899
02:54:28,050 --> 02:54:30,870
and gives you greater precision in what is

3900
02:54:30,870 --> 02:54:32,511
the ping to the front

3901
02:54:32,511 --> 02:54:35,230
at once

3902
02:54:35,800 --> 02:54:38,630
in addition to the aggressive part

3903
02:54:38,630 --> 02:54:41,119
you can also with the part you can

3904
02:54:41,119 --> 02:54:42,949
do passively with equal jordan

3905
02:54:42,949 --> 02:54:47,060
it keeps filters than the ones you can

3906
02:54:47,060 --> 02:54:49,279
directly add blocker then net

3907
02:54:49,279 --> 02:54:51,850
two points

3908
02:54:51,870 --> 02:54:54,900
and you can even add sn to it like so

3909
02:54:54,900 --> 02:54:58,160
is mentioning the sn

3910
02:54:58,160 --> 02:55:00,450
when a company is very large

3911
02:55:00,450 --> 02:55:02,940
google or facebook level for example

3912
02:55:02,940 --> 02:55:05,141
the

3913
02:55:05,141 --> 02:55:08,460
they register network blocks

3914
02:55:08,460 --> 02:55:10,050
let's say they have to go to an organization

3915
02:55:10,050 --> 02:55:12,240
to register the network blocks that

3916
02:55:12,240 --> 02:55:14,760
they are going to be public and that they are going to be

3917
02:55:14,760 --> 02:55:17,070
acquaintances of use of this company

3918
02:55:17,070 --> 02:55:19,830
so these angels have have

3919
02:55:19,830 --> 02:55:22,620
id have an idea on this

3920
02:55:22,620 --> 02:55:26,840
the case of google is that 15 16 9

3921
02:55:26,840 --> 02:55:29,880
then something that has done though is

3922
02:55:29,880 --> 02:55:33,180
very powerful is that you can add in the

3923
02:55:33,180 --> 02:55:35,340
idea is in and it will return all

3924
02:55:35,340 --> 02:55:38,450
host for all servers that have

3925
02:55:38,450 --> 02:55:42,300
that correspond to that being and then to

3926
02:55:42,300 --> 02:55:45,600
that's the then it's something it's a point

3927
02:55:45,600 --> 02:55:49,229
which I think is very familiar to us but

3928
02:55:49,229 --> 02:55:51,690
large companies often have sn

3929
02:55:51,690 --> 02:55:54,540
registered and therefore you could

3930
02:55:54,540 --> 02:55:56,400
get all network blocks

3931
02:55:56,400 --> 02:55:59,050
they have that aysén

3932
02:55:59,050 --> 02:56:02,200
and in this case assume that all those

3933
02:56:02,200 --> 02:56:05,439
shows will belong to google then

3934
02:56:05,439 --> 02:56:08,530
I mean, for example, in this sn only in this

3935
02:56:08,530 --> 02:56:10,300
from sn because he also has multiple

3936
02:56:10,300 --> 02:56:12,090
memberships of nine million hosts

3937
02:56:12,090 --> 02:56:15,160
then many nine million sounds

3938
02:56:15,160 --> 02:56:17,140
games but now imagine that instead

3939
02:56:17,140 --> 02:56:19,689
to search all over the internet now alone

3940
02:56:19,689 --> 02:56:21,550
We have to look for the millions, it won't go away

3941
02:56:21,550 --> 02:56:24,399
making smaller the

3942
02:56:24,399 --> 02:56:30,689
Let's say the sight that we are auditing

3943
02:56:30,689 --> 02:56:33,760
binary which is another similar joan has

3944
02:56:33,760 --> 02:56:36,850
they have very similar filters that

3945
02:56:36,850 --> 02:56:38,439
you can put the net in sight and nobody

3946
02:56:38,439 --> 02:56:43,329
les sl and adds and at the same time equals and

3947
02:56:43,329 --> 02:56:46,449
sense and if it's a little different don't

3948
02:56:46,449 --> 02:56:48,729
let's say from the filter exactly can

3949
02:56:48,729 --> 02:56:51,270
return post d

3950
02:56:51,270 --> 02:56:53,830
d

3951
02:56:53,830 --> 02:56:56,760
of health

3952
02:56:57,230 --> 02:56:59,360
and as I also commented a while ago there are

3953
02:56:59,360 --> 02:57:00,950
information that is sometimes already ready

3954
02:57:00,950 --> 02:57:04,010
for us or already

3955
02:57:04,010 --> 02:57:05,899
already this

3956
02:57:05,899 --> 02:57:08,539
the information that is already ready by

3957
02:57:08,539 --> 02:57:11,029
example the

3958
02:57:11,029 --> 02:57:14,109
most of

3959
02:57:14,390 --> 02:57:16,279
well there are many lists that are

3960
02:57:16,279 --> 02:57:19,370
public as what are the for which

3961
02:57:19,370 --> 02:57:21,140
ports that are most used the 100

3962
02:57:21,140 --> 02:57:23,600
most used ports 2000 more ports

3963
02:57:23,600 --> 02:57:25,330
used the

3964
02:57:25,330 --> 02:57:28,720
the 10,000 most used ports or the

3965
02:57:28,720 --> 02:57:32,100
services other than sql

3966
02:57:32,100 --> 02:57:35,440
ssh apache check there are lists that already

3967
02:57:35,440 --> 02:57:38,280
they have those ports

3968
02:57:38,290 --> 02:57:40,410
filtered for calling it another way

3969
02:57:40,410 --> 02:57:43,570
we can enter the list of

3970
02:57:43,570 --> 02:57:48,340
10,000 top ports in more scan and instead

3971
02:57:48,340 --> 02:57:50,021
to scan the 65,000 ports that

3972
02:57:50,021 --> 02:57:52,540
they have all the computers we would put

3973
02:57:52,540 --> 02:57:54,610
the success of scanning only those of the

3974
02:57:54,610 --> 02:57:58,260
top 100 is 2000 the top 10 thousand

3975
02:57:58,260 --> 02:58:00,359
there is even a lot of information that if

3976
02:58:00,359 --> 02:58:02,550
we found x open port there is already one

3977
02:58:02,550 --> 02:58:06,420
cbs promo who say not to be the

3978
02:58:06,420 --> 02:58:10,140
port x to run networks and cover x

3979
02:58:10,140 --> 02:58:12,720
assigned vulnerability or eg

3980
02:58:12,720 --> 02:58:15,149
has a default password that are

3981
02:58:15,149 --> 02:58:19,529
or the classic ftp not the 21 that has

3982
02:58:19,529 --> 02:58:22,590
anonymous login and if you have it then if not

3983
02:58:22,590 --> 02:58:24,960
it is disabled as ftp is

3984
02:58:24,960 --> 02:58:28,649
etc. but they are various forms of what

3985
02:58:28,649 --> 02:58:30,270
What could be done if you want to audit

3986
02:58:30,270 --> 02:58:32,550
the network is not but how do I tell you about this

3987
02:58:32,550 --> 02:58:34,649
no this is not in the bug flow

3988
02:58:34,649 --> 02:58:38,300
that we are like revisiting

3989
02:58:38,300 --> 02:58:41,520
but hey, returning the error to the

3990
02:58:41,520 --> 02:58:43,860
failure what

3991
02:58:43,860 --> 02:58:45,780
we were looking for we no longer have our

3992
02:58:45,780 --> 02:58:48,780
txt list of all subdomains of

3993
02:58:48,780 --> 02:58:50,830
cord google.com

3994
02:58:50,830 --> 02:58:54,070
and what we did was pass him a

3995
02:58:54,070 --> 02:58:55,930
tool called http that

3996
02:58:55,930 --> 02:58:57,940
basically that tool tells you if

3997
02:58:57,940 --> 02:59:00,430
the host responds something not the subdomain

3998
02:59:00,430 --> 02:59:06,690
answer something no basically it is literal

3999
02:59:06,790 --> 02:59:09,370
and pass that list try it and it will

4000
02:59:09,370 --> 02:59:11,470
answer this one is alive and this one says so

4001
02:59:11,470 --> 02:59:14,350
which was a new list from that

4002
02:59:14,350 --> 02:59:16,119
after there

4003
02:59:16,119 --> 02:59:18,060
we use

4004
02:59:18,060 --> 02:59:22,050
eyewitness which is like eyewitness

4005
02:59:22,050 --> 02:59:24,810
basically it is to take screenshots of

4006
02:59:24,810 --> 02:59:29,560
of the hosts that are alive as

4007
02:59:29,560 --> 02:59:31,180
As you can see here the list is already

4008
02:59:31,180 --> 02:59:32,859
calls proof basically on what

4009
02:59:32,859 --> 02:59:35,770
resulted from testing the domains in

4010
02:59:35,770 --> 02:59:38,350
general and then see which ones are alive and

4011
02:59:38,350 --> 02:59:41,109
then take a screenshot of the ones

4012
02:59:41,109 --> 02:59:43,560
they are alive

4013
02:59:45,641 --> 02:59:48,461
ok if recapitulating well then

4014
02:59:48,461 --> 02:59:51,521
we have the color list google.com

4015
02:59:51,521 --> 02:59:54,371
diagonal that was what we took from

4016
02:59:54,371 --> 02:59:57,801
our passive aggressive knowledge

4017
02:59:57,801 --> 03:00:01,820
that is, all the tools and the

4018
03:00:01,820 --> 03:00:04,551
search engines that we used and we got

4019
03:00:04,551 --> 03:00:08,121
about 12,000 house after that

4020
03:00:08,121 --> 03:00:09,531
We test if it is live from those shows

4021
03:00:09,531 --> 03:00:13,400
of its 12 thousand only thousand were

4022
03:00:13,400 --> 03:00:15,041
alive

4023
03:00:15,041 --> 03:00:17,271
and after that we go to the

4024
03:00:17,271 --> 03:00:19,940
visual display to identification

4025
03:00:19,940 --> 03:00:23,029
visual forgiveness of

4026
03:00:23,029 --> 03:00:26,079
of those 20 10 thousand 23

4027
03:00:26,079 --> 03:00:29,270
thousand 23 sorry then those who are

4028
03:00:29,270 --> 03:00:31,850
alive all returned written by

4029
03:00:31,850 --> 03:00:36,699
certain html files not from the server

4030
03:00:37,771 --> 03:00:40,921
very good once you have to run

4031
03:00:40,921 --> 03:00:42,690
there is that witness tool that is

4032
03:00:42,690 --> 03:00:45,091
the one who takes screenshots must have a

4033
03:00:45,091 --> 03:00:47,790
small graphical interface you can't

4034
03:00:47,790 --> 03:00:51,030
run on any static server and

4035
03:00:51,030 --> 03:00:54,320
gives you a mini summary of

4036
03:00:54,320 --> 03:00:56,681
what

4037
03:00:56,681 --> 03:00:58,780
that he answered for example here they are

4038
03:00:58,780 --> 03:01:00,940
there are four statuses there are four and

4039
03:01:00,940 --> 03:01:06,221
4 1 40,403 answered on http 11 that

4040
03:01:06,221 --> 03:01:09,251
4,044 answered that they have value and

4041
03:01:09,251 --> 03:01:12,041
you can others who have errors etc.

4042
03:01:12,041 --> 03:01:13,831
then

4043
03:01:13,831 --> 03:01:16,900
after having them let's say the

4044
03:01:16,900 --> 03:01:19,770
screenshot itself

4045
03:01:19,770 --> 03:01:22,199
there was one that caught my attention a lot

4046
03:01:22,199 --> 03:01:25,880
spring world.com management

4047
03:01:25,880 --> 03:01:27,999
Google com

4048
03:01:27,999 --> 03:01:29,919
because it caught my attention because it said

4049
03:01:29,919 --> 03:01:32,349
work and only

4050
03:01:32,349 --> 03:01:34,040
basically

4051
03:01:34,040 --> 03:01:36,680
pure pure work accounts could

4052
03:01:36,680 --> 03:01:40,450
use that server

4053
03:01:40,700 --> 03:01:43,340
so i said ok i'm going to focus on

4054
03:01:43,340 --> 03:01:46,610
this first point by point google.com and

4055
03:01:46,610 --> 03:01:48,800
In addition, it was publicly accessible

4056
03:01:48,800 --> 03:01:51,410
most one redirected to a login

4057
03:01:51,410 --> 03:01:54,860
google business and this one not then

4058
03:01:54,860 --> 03:01:57,940
what I did what I did was with a

4059
03:01:57,940 --> 03:02:02,350
brothel or is it called super basic http

4060
03:02:02,350 --> 03:02:04,720
I saw that how he behaved and to what extent

4061
03:02:04,720 --> 03:02:08,800
I was heading and what I noticed is that

4062
03:02:08,800 --> 03:02:12,189
scream world.com dot google.com what

4063
03:02:12,189 --> 03:02:14,250
redirected

4064
03:02:14,250 --> 03:02:17,170
espn.com that is, he took away the core and

4065
03:02:17,170 --> 03:02:21,520
then he was heading closer dot.com

4066
03:02:21,520 --> 03:02:24,640
which was this image but here was this

4067
03:02:24,640 --> 03:02:28,540
this domain in the middle that for what is

4068
03:02:28,540 --> 03:02:31,029
It made me weird, that is, the end was that

4069
03:02:31,029 --> 03:02:33,040
it was not that it was not hidden under a

4070
03:02:33,040 --> 03:02:35,170
login and what and what was accessible

4071
03:02:35,170 --> 03:02:37,390
publicly not

4072
03:02:37,390 --> 03:02:40,399
I wanted to focus later on this single

4073
03:02:40,399 --> 03:02:41,750
corp

4074
03:02:41,750 --> 03:02:44,430
to see what he did after the return

4075
03:02:44,430 --> 03:02:47,430
So from there I went to the part of the

4076
03:02:47,430 --> 03:02:49,640
of brute force so to speak

4077
03:02:49,640 --> 03:02:52,949
basically it was taking the dictionary that

4078
03:02:52,949 --> 03:02:57,930
from jaric the type of cyst and being

4079
03:02:57,930 --> 03:03:00,000
testing brute force combinations

4080
03:03:00,000 --> 03:03:04,789
in this domain in this its owner

4081
03:03:04,789 --> 03:03:08,630
for that the tool that uses be

4082
03:03:08,630 --> 03:03:11,760
a tool called w

4083
03:03:11,760 --> 03:03:13,170
it's like the web

4084
03:03:13,170 --> 03:03:16,300
fuster officer

4085
03:03:16,300 --> 03:03:19,489
basically quite parsed with a

4086
03:03:19,489 --> 03:03:21,680
filter is a tool that allows you

4087
03:03:21,680 --> 03:03:23,350
be sending information

4088
03:03:23,350 --> 03:03:26,859
hit a certain application

4089
03:03:26,859 --> 03:03:30,109
and allows you to review the let's say the

4090
03:03:30,109 --> 03:03:34,580
result or the answer of this one

4091
03:03:34,580 --> 03:03:36,859
combination you invented not in this

4092
03:03:36,859 --> 03:03:39,020
case what I did was literally both

4093
03:03:39,020 --> 03:03:42,960
million words of ya dix las

4094
03:03:42,960 --> 03:03:45,689
I was combining

4095
03:03:45,689 --> 03:03:48,479
and his brute force and combining in this

4096
03:03:48,479 --> 03:03:50,869
subdomain to see if it found anything

4097
03:03:50,869 --> 03:03:54,539
this lasted about an hour with 18

4098
03:03:54,539 --> 03:03:58,480
minutes when using double euros

4099
03:03:58,480 --> 03:04:00,010
[Applause]

4100
03:04:00,010 --> 03:04:02,500
later I found out about this tool that

4101
03:04:02,500 --> 03:04:07,170
pop pffff flame

4102
03:04:07,351 --> 03:04:10,831
of I am then it is supposed or what I know

4103
03:04:10,831 --> 03:04:12,160
sold

4104
03:04:12,160 --> 03:04:13,960
as sold is tools that is the

4105
03:04:13,960 --> 03:04:15,510
which is like a

4106
03:04:15,510 --> 03:04:20,170
be much faster and even this is

4107
03:04:20,170 --> 03:04:22,510
inspired by double buffaz that's the one

4108
03:04:22,510 --> 03:04:25,840
I used but it's a lot a lot a lot

4109
03:04:25,840 --> 03:04:28,240
faster happens even if you don't know

4110
03:04:28,240 --> 03:04:30,370
realize the syntax is very similar

4111
03:04:30,370 --> 03:04:32,200
but the difference is that this one is

4112
03:04:32,200 --> 03:04:34,210
written in go and double in fossa is in

4113
03:04:34,210 --> 03:04:36,190
python then interpret say is

4114
03:04:36,190 --> 03:04:38,110
compiled then in quotes

4115
03:04:38,110 --> 03:04:40,660
should be so much faster

4116
03:04:40,660 --> 03:04:42,311
after doing the same test

4117
03:04:42,311 --> 03:04:46,110
try same dictionary two million

4118
03:04:46,130 --> 03:04:49,550
lasted 18 minutes in infusion 2 million

4119
03:04:49,550 --> 03:04:53,221
of words then an hour 20

4120
03:04:53,221 --> 03:04:55,960
less than 20 minutes

4121
03:04:55,960 --> 03:04:57,600
and

4122
03:04:57,600 --> 03:04:59,550
and there buying that pop is four times

4123
03:04:59,550 --> 03:05:02,330
faster than double post

4124
03:05:02,330 --> 03:05:05,380
all those tools

4125
03:05:05,410 --> 03:05:08,470
that they are faster or that I am going like

4126
03:05:08,470 --> 03:05:10,210
making the comparison the fast ones are not

4127
03:05:10,210 --> 03:05:13,000
use them the first time of the flow

4128
03:05:13,000 --> 03:05:15,220
Let's say once I met the ones that

4129
03:05:15,220 --> 03:05:17,440
I knew the other tools that I visited

4130
03:05:17,440 --> 03:05:20,680
this this error and then and I went back to

4131
03:05:20,680 --> 03:05:23,620
document as the entire process and there

4132
03:05:23,620 --> 03:05:25,271
It was when I did the tests

4133
03:05:25,271 --> 03:05:27,840
weather

4134
03:05:27,920 --> 03:05:31,520
and at the end of all this of all this

4135
03:05:31,520 --> 03:05:34,529
process of all this

4136
03:05:34,529 --> 03:05:38,040
let's say two tests

4137
03:05:38,040 --> 03:05:40,110
I only found I found a

4138
03:05:40,110 --> 03:05:41,880
interesting directory than the diagonal

4139
03:05:41,880 --> 03:05:44,240
that's it

4140
03:05:44,989 --> 03:05:46,750
and

4141
03:05:46,750 --> 03:05:48,279
okay

4142
03:05:48,279 --> 03:05:51,159
once we navigate to the first

4143
03:05:51,159 --> 03:05:53,430
dot google.com diagonal already

4144
03:05:53,430 --> 03:05:57,569
was not heading yet

4145
03:05:57,569 --> 03:06:00,959
to an internal google triangle of

4146
03:06:00,959 --> 03:06:02,520
fact that it is possible to see what prot says

4147
03:06:02,520 --> 03:06:07,560
dot.com and certain common data or

4148
03:06:07,560 --> 03:06:10,680
internal no not true true

4149
03:06:10,680 --> 03:06:13,890
memory and cpu information and monitoring

4150
03:06:13,890 --> 03:06:16,290
from the core network

4151
03:06:16,290 --> 03:06:18,840
once I got there I no longer wanted

4152
03:06:18,840 --> 03:06:20,510
follow up

4153
03:06:20,510 --> 03:06:23,420
let's say brute force or something

4154
03:06:23,420 --> 03:06:25,729
could affect this server because it

4155
03:06:25,729 --> 03:06:27,370
I saw that it was something important

4156
03:06:27,370 --> 03:06:30,260
So there I stopped and what I did was

4157
03:06:30,260 --> 03:06:32,029
move on to the web scraping part that

4158
03:06:32,029 --> 03:06:34,180
basically it is

4159
03:06:34,180 --> 03:06:36,220
in the source code of the page

4160
03:06:36,220 --> 03:06:39,460
sample by say the html search search

4161
03:06:39,460 --> 03:06:42,609
information or filtered by the tool

4162
03:06:42,609 --> 03:06:46,420
that I use is called javier's ht track

4163
03:06:46,420 --> 03:06:48,819
basically what roche does is that

4164
03:06:48,819 --> 03:06:51,130
makes a clone of the web page so

4165
03:06:51,130 --> 03:06:54,100
recursive on your computer pass works

4166
03:06:54,100 --> 03:06:56,050
everything even if you have hyperlinks like

4167
03:06:56,050 --> 03:06:58,029
those who are seen here well are like

4168
03:06:58,029 --> 03:07:00,550
it navigates the hyperlink and

4169
03:07:00,550 --> 03:07:01,840
Download what's inside

4170
03:07:01,840 --> 03:07:03,760
hyperlink and if there are more hyperlinks

4171
03:07:03,760 --> 03:07:04,989
inside the pages too

4172
03:07:04,989 --> 03:07:07,660
download all that let's tell you what

4173
03:07:07,660 --> 03:07:09,729
all content on this website

4174
03:07:09,729 --> 03:07:12,489
they put it, download it in a folder and

4175
03:07:12,489 --> 03:07:16,540
after that use grep from the

4176
03:07:16,540 --> 03:07:18,830
terminal is normal for

4177
03:07:18,830 --> 03:07:20,800
to do this

4178
03:07:20,800 --> 03:07:23,109
leaked not with seven brought the

4179
03:07:23,109 --> 03:07:25,240
literal url and how it will be called

4180
03:07:25,240 --> 03:07:29,110
discharge background

4181
03:07:29,110 --> 03:07:34,181
the let's say the html and javascript code

4182
03:07:34,181 --> 03:07:35,431
of the page

4183
03:07:35,431 --> 03:07:39,551
and in the end I made a group of the file

4184
03:07:39,551 --> 03:07:43,410
the same inside the background the file the same

4185
03:07:43,410 --> 03:07:46,170
for those who already have a certain time

4186
03:07:46,170 --> 03:07:49,830
doing tests and that they know that

4187
03:07:49,830 --> 03:07:53,910
probably that parameter does exist

4188
03:07:53,910 --> 03:07:56,910
may be vulnerable to cross leg

4189
03:07:56,910 --> 03:07:59,510
or what was the inclusion

4190
03:07:59,510 --> 03:08:02,330
local feil discovery

4191
03:08:02,330 --> 03:08:06,120
but it's like almost certainly going to

4192
03:08:06,120 --> 03:08:08,340
it could be that there will be a problem because

4193
03:08:08,340 --> 03:08:10,680
literally it is usually that they give him the

4194
03:08:10,680 --> 03:08:13,290
path of the file you want what you want

4195
03:08:13,290 --> 03:08:16,521
this one that they load or the server

4196
03:08:16,521 --> 03:08:20,610
then at the end of that it was again

4197
03:08:20,610 --> 03:08:23,521
another group on the results to see

4198
03:08:23,521 --> 03:08:26,630
if there was some atmosphere or barber

4199
03:08:26,630 --> 03:08:29,140
and this url came out

4200
03:08:29,140 --> 03:08:33,470
basically he is pointing at her

4201
03:08:33,470 --> 03:08:37,420
proxy file send to those who have

4202
03:08:37,420 --> 03:08:40,070
some time using linux you know that in

4203
03:08:40,070 --> 03:08:41,960
that in this file well they find

4204
03:08:41,960 --> 03:08:43,180
all environment variables

4205
03:08:43,180 --> 03:08:46,550
of being running everything I did

4206
03:08:46,550 --> 03:08:48,020
was grabbing all that link line

4207
03:08:48,020 --> 03:08:50,500
sail

4208
03:08:52,350 --> 03:08:56,479
after getting the line and navigating

4209
03:08:56,479 --> 03:08:58,819
to google chrome paste lic and

4210
03:08:58,819 --> 03:09:00,920
indeed all the variables are

4211
03:09:00,920 --> 03:09:03,939
environment of that server

4212
03:09:04,271 --> 03:09:08,230
there in plain text before I get excited

4213
03:09:08,230 --> 03:09:13,381
I thought I'd better leave it is a file of 6

4214
03:09:13,381 --> 03:09:16,150
static no that is not a t exists

4215
03:09:16,150 --> 03:09:18,881
literally there that they left or not to be and what

4216
03:09:18,881 --> 03:09:21,370
what i did was change the file path

4217
03:09:21,370 --> 03:09:25,060
does not have the file for the same

4218
03:09:25,060 --> 03:09:26,859
[Music]

4219
03:09:26,859 --> 03:09:29,919
and check with the pro version which is the

4220
03:09:29,919 --> 03:09:33,189
file that tells you the version of

4221
03:09:33,189 --> 03:09:35,739
linux is fighting and loading then there

4222
03:09:35,739 --> 03:09:39,520
It was when I already said no, I'm already doing

4223
03:09:39,520 --> 03:09:43,510
and if it's something important it worked and that's it

4224
03:09:43,510 --> 03:09:45,609
it is verified that it was not that it was not

4225
03:09:45,609 --> 03:09:47,770
something calculated because then they can be

4226
03:09:47,770 --> 03:09:48,960
upload files

4227
03:09:48,960 --> 03:09:53,150
changing the route from here to the fire

4228
03:09:53,150 --> 03:09:54,790
and

4229
03:09:54,790 --> 03:09:57,670
in the end being honest and try to

4230
03:09:57,670 --> 03:10:01,450
escalate this in the remote code but no

4231
03:10:01,450 --> 03:10:02,800
could

4232
03:10:02,800 --> 03:10:05,260
the server was very protected very

4233
03:10:05,260 --> 03:10:08,021
I was like very card in hoisted of a certain

4234
03:10:08,021 --> 03:10:09,640
so that I couldn't load things that weren't

4235
03:10:09,640 --> 03:10:12,070
may of the prop and for example the

4236
03:10:12,070 --> 03:10:13,620
variables of

4237
03:10:13,620 --> 03:10:16,150
environment they had nothing that I

4238
03:10:16,150 --> 03:10:18,580
could you give me access to the german server

4239
03:10:18,580 --> 03:10:21,160
internal or for example the own brawn

4240
03:10:21,160 --> 03:10:23,170
diagonal efe which is sometimes used for

4241
03:10:23,170 --> 03:10:25,180
climb

4242
03:10:25,180 --> 03:10:28,600
the session was not accessible so accessible

4243
03:10:28,600 --> 03:10:31,130
the beaches of seychelles

4244
03:10:31,130 --> 03:10:34,210
nor the logs either, that is, look for logs of

4245
03:10:34,210 --> 03:10:37,250
http to see if you can that I saw it not the

4246
03:10:37,250 --> 03:10:39,680
you can't really silos and i tried but

4247
03:10:39,680 --> 03:10:41,660
after all, it was something important and

4248
03:10:41,660 --> 03:10:44,630
I decided to report it

4249
03:10:44,630 --> 03:10:47,990
then pass the recap of this

4250
03:10:47,990 --> 03:10:50,410
failure came first

4251
03:10:50,410 --> 03:10:52,050
In a global form

4252
03:10:52,050 --> 03:10:53,680
we say a discovery of

4253
03:10:53,680 --> 03:10:56,561
organization and the first thing was to see the

4254
03:10:56,561 --> 03:10:59,021
scope of the program which is very

4255
03:10:59,021 --> 03:11:01,480
important or know what rules the

4256
03:11:01,480 --> 03:11:03,070
program because regularly if not

4257
03:11:03,070 --> 03:11:04,570
follow the rules of the program do not suit you

4258
03:11:04,570 --> 03:11:07,510
to pay it then it is important to continue

4259
03:11:07,510 --> 03:11:09,000
the rules to stay out of trouble

4260
03:11:09,000 --> 03:11:12,480
and know what we have to review

4261
03:11:12,480 --> 03:11:15,340
after that we took a

4262
03:11:15,340 --> 03:11:17,771
subdomain in this case was by dot

4263
03:11:17,771 --> 03:11:20,680
google.com after there what we did

4264
03:11:20,680 --> 03:11:23,260
was that of the discovery of his

4265
03:11:23,260 --> 03:11:25,240
domains aggressively and aggressively

4266
03:11:25,240 --> 03:11:28,090
passive and at the end was the

4267
03:11:28,090 --> 03:11:29,851
display

4268
03:11:29,851 --> 03:11:33,040
with screenshots of what was alive and

4269
03:11:33,040 --> 03:11:36,220
of what was left after that

4270
03:11:36,220 --> 03:11:39,521
was what what was brute force

4271
03:11:39,521 --> 03:11:42,130
to see that

4272
03:11:42,130 --> 03:11:43,840
what word could someone give us

4273
03:11:43,840 --> 03:11:45,970
directory or something important with the

4274
03:11:45,970 --> 03:11:48,550
the goal list txt and in the end no

4275
03:11:48,550 --> 03:11:51,700
got key as directory

4276
03:11:51,700 --> 03:11:53,250
internal

4277
03:11:53,250 --> 03:11:55,630
after that we lowered all that

4278
03:11:55,630 --> 03:11:57,399
application we made a local copy with

4279
03:11:57,399 --> 03:12:00,160
this track to make the escape

4280
03:12:00,160 --> 03:12:04,470
and at the end filter serious

4281
03:12:04,470 --> 03:12:08,130
with the same file

4282
03:12:08,689 --> 03:12:13,220
and then already result in profits

4283
03:12:13,220 --> 03:12:15,920
after all this what result of

4284
03:12:15,920 --> 03:12:18,460
this failure

4285
03:12:18,810 --> 03:12:21,500
First of all, as I told you, well

4286
03:12:21,500 --> 03:12:25,380
the truth is that I had a lot of fun if it's being

4287
03:12:25,380 --> 03:12:29,040
such a large organization if anything

4288
03:12:29,040 --> 03:12:30,449
considerable amount of time

4289
03:12:30,449 --> 03:12:33,899
invest and for the same reason I try to find

4290
03:12:33,899 --> 03:12:34,859
tools that go very fast

4291
03:12:34,859 --> 03:12:39,109
to try to pass the stages

4292
03:12:39,109 --> 03:12:43,820
from one stage to another faster no

4293
03:12:43,820 --> 03:12:46,940
back then back then stay

4294
03:12:46,940 --> 03:12:50,150
ranking 62 worldwide in google and

4295
03:12:50,150 --> 03:12:54,110
Right now I eat at 100 and fair 105 104

4296
03:12:54,110 --> 03:12:56,601
flights and it is then that at level in the

4297
03:12:56,601 --> 03:13:01,730
in the range 62 and 20 and 13 thousand

4298
03:13:01,730 --> 03:13:04,431
dollars obviously very good very good

4299
03:13:04,431 --> 03:13:07,010
incentive and

4300
03:13:07,010 --> 03:13:11,149
and let's say google is a team that

4301
03:13:11,149 --> 03:13:14,300
knows that they know when something is

4302
03:13:14,300 --> 03:13:18,260
important and let's not say they don't walk no

4303
03:13:18,260 --> 03:13:21,760
try to hide or try to

4304
03:13:21,760 --> 03:13:25,640
fix things but pay and so they

4305
03:13:25,640 --> 03:13:26,930
when when they know it's something

4306
03:13:26,930 --> 03:13:29,080
important they take it very seriously and

4307
03:13:29,080 --> 03:13:31,160
that's why they are usually rewarded

4308
03:13:31,160 --> 03:13:34,330
quite quite high the

4309
03:13:34,330 --> 03:13:36,500
something also important here goes

4310
03:13:36,500 --> 03:13:38,540
mention that they gave me the reward

4311
03:13:38,540 --> 03:13:41,569
higher than was considered as

4312
03:13:41,569 --> 03:13:43,270
remote code execution

4313
03:13:43,270 --> 03:13:45,649
even though I couldn't do the

4314
03:13:45,649 --> 03:13:48,350
remote game execution what happens is

4315
03:13:48,350 --> 03:13:50,029
let the google team them

4316
03:13:50,029 --> 03:13:51,370
internally

4317
03:13:51,370 --> 03:13:54,080
they were able to execute remote code that is

4318
03:13:54,080 --> 03:13:57,620
They were able to escalate this bug and how

4319
03:13:57,620 --> 03:13:59,779
you already know that it is possible that it was a matter

4320
03:13:59,779 --> 03:14:02,020
of time that someone could

4321
03:14:02,020 --> 03:14:04,790
have remote mail run on this

4322
03:14:04,790 --> 03:14:07,729
server that's why they take it as you

4323
03:14:07,729 --> 03:14:10,430
they pay how to put impact for saying it

4324
03:14:10,430 --> 03:14:14,210
so it's pretty pretty good no because

4325
03:14:14,210 --> 03:14:15,250
in other programs

4326
03:14:15,250 --> 03:14:17,779
Latino experiences that if you are not

4327
03:14:17,779 --> 03:14:22,939
able to demonstrate x x this impact or

4328
03:14:22,939 --> 03:14:26,180
how critical it is they minimize and treat it

4329
03:14:26,180 --> 03:14:28,630
to pay less and already and here in google

4330
03:14:28,630 --> 03:14:31,310
once this is the opposite of them

4331
03:14:31,310 --> 03:14:33,859
They help you to scale as much as possible

4332
03:14:33,859 --> 03:14:38,060
you can and after that you already have

4333
03:14:38,060 --> 03:14:40,100
the proper reward not to the failure that

4334
03:14:40,100 --> 03:14:42,050
by contrast

4335
03:14:42,050 --> 03:14:44,660
ok once I'm there we find a

4336
03:14:44,660 --> 03:14:47,870
failure and many people then go to

4337
03:14:47,870 --> 03:14:50,260
another thing

4338
03:14:50,570 --> 03:14:52,710
usually

4339
03:14:52,710 --> 03:14:55,950
Well, yes, that is, this same error

4340
03:14:55,950 --> 03:14:59,190
They want to look at other companies, I do.

4341
03:14:59,190 --> 03:15:02,729
than a part of the process that you add in

4342
03:15:02,729 --> 03:15:05,790
All my process is something that I call it

4343
03:15:05,790 --> 03:15:07,770
the duck test maybe someone already

4344
03:15:07,770 --> 03:15:09,930
you hear not necessarily something from

4345
03:15:09,930 --> 03:15:13,380
security but but I liked I liked the

4346
03:15:13,380 --> 03:15:15,120
idea to add it what is the test the

4347
03:15:15,120 --> 03:15:19,590
pate, that is, if something looks like a duck, nothing

4348
03:15:19,590 --> 03:15:22,470
like a duck and quacks like a duck

4349
03:15:22,470 --> 03:15:25,860
so they are probably part that is

4350
03:15:25,860 --> 03:15:28,470
the yard test

4351
03:15:28,470 --> 03:15:30,899
So what was I thinking of?

4352
03:15:30,899 --> 03:15:35,319
that is, I said that he has this fault

4353
03:15:35,319 --> 03:15:37,319
on their servers

4354
03:15:37,319 --> 03:15:41,319
they do not deploy servers

4355
03:15:41,319 --> 03:15:44,050
one by one they do it on a scale or

4356
03:15:44,050 --> 03:15:47,470
automated so i said ok yeah

4357
03:15:47,470 --> 03:15:49,229
have a mistake

4358
03:15:49,229 --> 03:15:52,289
probably that mistake if edu se

4359
03:15:52,289 --> 03:15:54,819
deployed in a systematic way because in

4360
03:15:54,819 --> 03:15:57,339
other parts then basically what

4361
03:15:57,339 --> 03:15:59,739
I did was get in done dan told us the

4362
03:15:59,739 --> 03:16:00,899
seeker is the

4363
03:16:00,899 --> 03:16:04,720
google's younger brother and put the

4364
03:16:04,720 --> 03:16:07,390
filters of what was the flame background

4365
03:16:07,390 --> 03:16:10,020
and the google organization

4366
03:16:10,020 --> 03:16:12,720
basically i told all the servers

4367
03:16:12,720 --> 03:16:14,270
that you find that they have the

4368
03:16:14,270 --> 03:16:16,500
java east directory and that

4369
03:16:16,500 --> 03:16:19,649
belong to google damaris and for me

4370
03:16:19,649 --> 03:16:24,210
surprise there were six of those six one is

4371
03:16:24,210 --> 03:16:27,948
the one that I had already reported

4372
03:16:28,050 --> 03:16:31,750
there was another that was not accessible

4373
03:16:31,750 --> 03:16:35,680
help bandos and the other 44 sorry

4374
03:16:35,680 --> 03:16:38,500
I returned to report as I mean as

4375
03:16:38,500 --> 03:16:40,480
result were three other failures

4376
03:16:40,480 --> 03:16:45,040
valid and 14 that was duplicated because

4377
03:16:45,040 --> 03:16:47,260
apparently it was I don't know if it was the same

4378
03:16:47,260 --> 03:16:49,180
server or did it have to do with a server

4379
03:16:49,180 --> 03:16:52,330
which deploys another but only that is

4380
03:16:52,330 --> 03:16:55,480
just by thinking about that google

4381
03:16:55,480 --> 03:16:57,580
probably deployed more servers

4382
03:16:57,580 --> 03:17:00,400
the same as the ones I found and with certain

4383
03:17:00,400 --> 03:17:04,450
fingerprints in sudan i was able to get from

4384
03:17:04,450 --> 03:17:06,040
return which public servants

4385
03:17:06,040 --> 03:17:09,040
they had that information that in fact this

4386
03:17:09,040 --> 03:17:12,490
this is outdated i already found

4387
03:17:12,490 --> 03:17:16,450
still but compared 33 more with the same

4388
03:17:16,450 --> 03:17:19,980
problems with variations

4389
03:17:20,610 --> 03:17:22,891
but yes, that is, it is very important

4390
03:17:22,891 --> 03:17:24,870
revisit our failures and it is something

4391
03:17:24,870 --> 03:17:26,450
something I have not seen that people

4392
03:17:26,450 --> 03:17:29,130
comment a lot but this type can happen

4393
03:17:29,130 --> 03:17:30,920
of things, that is, if you already know

4394
03:17:30,920 --> 03:17:33,030
specifically the behavior of a

4395
03:17:33,030 --> 03:17:34,681
server you vulnerable

4396
03:17:34,681 --> 03:17:37,560
you can use sudan

4397
03:17:37,560 --> 03:17:39,540
Well, filter in a certain way so that you

4398
03:17:39,540 --> 03:17:42,090
return servers very similar as

4399
03:17:42,090 --> 03:17:44,449
a pad

4400
03:17:46,540 --> 03:17:49,960
and well after all that

4401
03:17:49,960 --> 03:17:52,210
lessons learned from all this

4402
03:17:52,210 --> 03:17:54,150
exercise

4403
03:17:54,150 --> 03:17:56,641
for me it is to keep the basics never

4404
03:17:56,641 --> 03:17:59,460
underestimate the basic weights if

4405
03:17:59,460 --> 03:18:01,320
realize we are talking about tools

4406
03:18:01,320 --> 03:18:04,051
simple configurations

4407
03:18:04,051 --> 03:18:06,240
tools but I did not put much emphasis

4408
03:18:06,240 --> 03:18:08,851
because it is not so important in itself

4409
03:18:08,851 --> 03:18:10,561
tools or saint for me what

4410
03:18:10,561 --> 03:18:12,660
important is the analysis and for the

4411
03:18:12,660 --> 03:18:14,971
people who are just starting

4412
03:18:14,971 --> 03:18:16,261
I recommend that you focus on the

4413
03:18:16,261 --> 03:18:18,940
bone analysis

4414
03:18:18,940 --> 03:18:21,070
what we want to do is the

4415
03:18:21,070 --> 03:18:23,141
I can talk in six steps right now or

4416
03:18:23,141 --> 03:18:25,000
whatever we were doing first

4417
03:18:25,000 --> 03:18:27,671
is to see the program 'rewards and your

4418
03:18:27,671 --> 03:18:28,801
global reach

4419
03:18:28,801 --> 03:18:32,190
second list your domains

4420
03:18:32,190 --> 03:18:34,931
after numerous goods see which ones

4421
03:18:34,931 --> 03:18:37,870
are alive of those which are alive

4422
03:18:37,870 --> 03:18:42,090
take screenshots of those writing shots

4423
03:18:42,090 --> 03:18:45,030
to make a visual review and the one who

4424
03:18:45,030 --> 03:18:46,500
seems interesting to make the web is

4425
03:18:46,500 --> 03:18:47,910
traffic be download this page

4426
03:18:47,910 --> 03:18:50,280
complete and to filter the to see if

4427
03:18:50,280 --> 03:18:52,770
we found something important in there and not

4428
03:18:52,770 --> 03:18:53,939
there is no tool in between

4429
03:18:53,939 --> 03:18:56,189
well sometimes maybe tomorrow they will release something

4430
03:18:56,189 --> 03:18:57,899
better than four or something better than the

4431
03:18:57,899 --> 03:19:00,359
however something better than more are and

4432
03:19:00,359 --> 03:19:02,160
it will simply be to exchange the

4433
03:19:02,160 --> 03:19:03,720
tool in the step that we are lo

4434
03:19:03,720 --> 03:19:06,390
important are the steps but there are times

4435
03:19:06,390 --> 03:19:08,160
What are you saying, no, well, I like this one better.

4436
03:19:08,160 --> 03:19:09,600
this sea birthing tool

4437
03:19:09,600 --> 03:19:11,761
screenshots

4438
03:19:11,761 --> 03:19:13,860
and it's valid, you just move it and the

4439
03:19:13,860 --> 03:19:16,291
you change and adjust your methodology because

4440
03:19:16,291 --> 03:19:17,940
with the methodology is a is something

4441
03:19:17,940 --> 03:19:20,440
separate to what is the tools

4442
03:19:20,440 --> 03:19:21,640
[Music]

4443
03:19:21,640 --> 03:19:23,830
but already speaking of tools something

4444
03:19:23,830 --> 03:19:25,210
important is that the tools

4445
03:19:25,210 --> 03:19:26,890
they have settings you can't

4446
03:19:26,890 --> 03:19:29,680
put the time out for example of saray

4447
03:19:29,680 --> 03:19:31,960
witness where you can decide how much

4448
03:19:31,960 --> 03:19:33,130
you want me to wait to take the

4449
03:19:33,130 --> 03:19:36,370
writer if the server does not respond the

4450
03:19:36,370 --> 03:19:38,580
by default it has seven seconds I think

4451
03:19:38,580 --> 03:19:42,010
but in my case I always add that

4452
03:19:42,010 --> 03:19:45,670
the second answer me yes no yes no

4453
03:19:45,670 --> 03:19:48,220
answered the second that follows but that

4454
03:19:48,220 --> 03:19:50,560
It is fully configurable, thanks.

4455
03:19:50,560 --> 03:19:52,960
to your preferences yes or if you know that

4456
03:19:52,960 --> 03:19:54,580
there are servers that can last 30

4457
03:19:54,580 --> 03:19:56,560
seconds to answer because you can

4458
03:19:56,560 --> 03:19:59,080
ring and since 30 seconds have passed if you

4459
03:19:59,080 --> 03:20:01,479
you go on to the next one but it's something I know

4460
03:20:01,479 --> 03:20:03,460
can configure then it is important

4461
03:20:03,460 --> 03:20:05,050
just copy and paste the tools

4462
03:20:05,050 --> 03:20:09,899
but see the configurations you have

4463
03:20:10,189 --> 03:20:13,060
to know how you can

4464
03:20:13,060 --> 03:20:15,590
let's say how you can adjust for what

4465
03:20:15,590 --> 03:20:19,310
you are looking for nothing else is to be

4466
03:20:19,310 --> 03:20:20,899
professional many times there is a lot

4467
03:20:20,899 --> 03:20:24,020
frustration and as I comment

4468
03:20:24,020 --> 03:20:25,489
programs sometimes do not give us the

4469
03:20:25,489 --> 03:20:27,380
answers that we want but

4470
03:20:27,380 --> 03:20:31,189
It's just like, well, that's how it is, that is, yes

4471
03:20:31,189 --> 03:20:32,720
you have if you want to be a professional

4472
03:20:32,720 --> 03:20:34,340
you have to accept as a professional that is

4473
03:20:34,340 --> 03:20:38,370
polite to wait then

4474
03:20:38,370 --> 03:20:42,480
discipline is constancy is very

4475
03:20:42,480 --> 03:20:45,240
very important

4476
03:20:45,240 --> 03:20:47,790
daily even a little for this I go

4477
03:20:47,790 --> 03:20:49,110
to address this issue but daily although

4478
03:20:49,110 --> 03:20:50,521
be a little there that we are documenting

4479
03:20:50,521 --> 03:20:53,910
or follow the people who are involved

4480
03:20:53,910 --> 03:20:55,980
or be reading because yes yes it is

4481
03:20:55,980 --> 03:20:59,340
important as soon as that discipline is done

4482
03:20:59,340 --> 03:21:01,650
is what gives you results

4483
03:21:01,650 --> 03:21:03,690
Another thing is that you don't have to give yourself so much

4484
03:21:03,690 --> 03:21:05,940
hurry many times we are very

4485
03:21:05,940 --> 03:21:07,200
accelerated and especially not

4486
03:21:07,200 --> 03:21:11,101
we started this takes a long time

4487
03:21:11,101 --> 03:21:12,811
fact could cancer is bored to

4488
03:21:12,811 --> 03:21:15,199
some people

4489
03:21:16,460 --> 03:21:19,120
but if patience patience patience

4490
03:21:19,120 --> 03:21:22,610
I give you an example is la and microsoft

4491
03:21:22,610 --> 03:21:23,990
I think they are already more agile in their

4492
03:21:23,990 --> 03:21:25,540
response times but in its time

4493
03:21:25,540 --> 03:21:27,610
12 years ago

4494
03:21:27,610 --> 03:21:31,130
They answered me after 16 months or more

4495
03:21:31,130 --> 03:21:33,530
less then since I reported until

4496
03:21:33,530 --> 03:21:36,350
to get the profit was 16 months

4497
03:21:36,350 --> 03:21:39,950
in each one then it is something that

4498
03:21:39,950 --> 03:21:42,920
you have to be very patient another

4499
03:21:42,920 --> 03:21:45,170
important thing is to avoid bon outs or

4500
03:21:45,170 --> 03:21:48,410
or burn out or overload can be

4501
03:21:48,410 --> 03:21:51,470
say that there are times that the ruling does not

4502
03:21:51,470 --> 03:21:54,590
you cannot raise it, that is, by more than

4503
03:21:54,590 --> 03:21:56,750
try yes to search and do no

4504
03:21:56,750 --> 03:21:59,720
you can climb it happened to me with him with him

4505
03:21:59,720 --> 03:22:02,750
from yahoo i found an ex 1x ss in a

4506
03:22:02,750 --> 03:22:05,090
mobile application and report it to me

4507
03:22:05,090 --> 03:22:07,000
mark with a formative

4508
03:22:07,000 --> 03:22:10,180
and I knew that I could do it, which I couldn't

4509
03:22:10,180 --> 03:22:12,160
informative, well, yes, I knew this.

4510
03:22:12,160 --> 03:22:15,880
it can climb but i lasted like 23 days

4511
03:22:15,880 --> 03:22:18,100
wanting and could not until I decided

4512
03:22:18,100 --> 03:22:19,960
release it and that I will not continue with my

4513
03:22:19,960 --> 03:22:24,460
life and one day eight months later I

4514
03:22:24,460 --> 03:22:26,380
came the idea how to exploit it and

4515
03:22:26,380 --> 03:22:29,080
I barely did it and that was because I read

4516
03:22:29,080 --> 03:22:31,860
more things because I went on with my life and

4517
03:22:31,860 --> 03:22:34,090
I just said that I can't do it

4518
03:22:34,090 --> 03:22:37,540
right now and after months only the

4519
03:22:37,540 --> 03:22:39,700
answer and I was able to continue the escalation and

4520
03:22:39,700 --> 03:22:42,130
it was paid and everything out there is the blog

4521
03:22:42,130 --> 03:22:44,300
come from yahoo

4522
03:22:44,300 --> 03:22:46,910
in my page

4523
03:22:46,910 --> 03:22:49,311
another very important thing is to learn

4524
03:22:49,311 --> 03:22:51,920
English more than anything for communication

4525
03:22:51,920 --> 03:22:54,650
almost all companies receive their

4526
03:22:54,650 --> 03:22:57,021
reports in English and the information that

4527
03:22:57,021 --> 03:22:58,101
it's good

4528
03:22:58,101 --> 03:23:01,641
is usually in English every time or little by little

4529
03:23:01,641 --> 03:23:03,290
There are few things in Spanish but the

4530
03:23:03,290 --> 03:23:05,150
The reality is that in almost all areas

4531
03:23:05,150 --> 03:23:07,311
the good information is in

4532
03:23:07,311 --> 03:23:10,010
English is not important if you demand it is

4533
03:23:10,010 --> 03:23:11,601
complicated it was very complicated for me

4534
03:23:11,601 --> 03:23:14,840
but but with practice and with the idea

4535
03:23:14,840 --> 03:23:17,540
that it is one more tool then

4536
03:23:17,540 --> 03:23:19,279
may

4537
03:23:19,279 --> 03:23:22,069
you can see it like this social knowing english is

4538
03:23:22,069 --> 03:23:24,409
a tool more than more than another

4539
03:23:24,409 --> 03:23:26,370
stuff

4540
03:23:26,370 --> 03:23:30,030
another important thing in being reading reading

4541
03:23:30,030 --> 03:23:31,870
read

4542
03:23:31,870 --> 03:23:34,180
to what I am going to recommend not to

4543
03:23:34,180 --> 03:23:36,010
to overwhelm I know it sounds very cliché

4544
03:23:36,010 --> 03:23:40,181
that we fight and that now with that

4545
03:23:40,181 --> 03:23:42,940
we are going to learn it but sometimes you have

4546
03:23:42,940 --> 03:23:46,501
ten books that have come out in your

4547
03:23:46,501 --> 03:23:50,110
youth or in your bookshelf and you don't even know

4548
03:23:50,110 --> 03:23:53,591
how to start what I did was read a

4549
03:23:53,591 --> 03:23:56,230
thing a day or a blog post a day is a

4550
03:23:56,230 --> 03:23:59,171
goal that I started a rap pill ago

4551
03:23:59,171 --> 03:24:03,101
moon 2015 then to read one thing at

4552
03:24:03,101 --> 03:24:05,860
day sounds something that is to see relatively

4553
03:24:05,860 --> 03:24:08,381
simple I do not open more times and drink coffee

4554
03:24:08,381 --> 03:24:11,510
for example you can do with your coffee

4555
03:24:11,510 --> 03:24:14,450
and it is a habit that I promise you will

4556
03:24:14,450 --> 03:24:15,859
change a lot, that is, they are going to learn

4557
03:24:15,859 --> 03:24:18,800
too much although it sounds very very fat that

4558
03:24:18,800 --> 03:24:21,560
I made that purpose in 2015 or so

4559
03:24:21,560 --> 03:24:25,460
less right now we are at 222 let's say 7

4560
03:24:25,460 --> 03:24:27,590
desserts are like two thousand days more than

4561
03:24:27,590 --> 03:24:31,729
2000 days not then since that day I have

4562
03:24:31,729 --> 03:24:33,890
read one thing a day at least

4563
03:24:33,890 --> 03:24:38,450
security and it's already like seven years

4564
03:24:38,450 --> 03:24:41,899
as more than 2,000 days to mean

4565
03:24:41,899 --> 03:24:44,060
that there are more than two thousand things that I read

4566
03:24:44,060 --> 03:24:46,460
it was seen then the could sound like

4567
03:24:46,460 --> 03:24:49,279
start reading on the fact day before

4568
03:24:49,279 --> 03:24:52,279
someone computer or security blog

4569
03:24:52,279 --> 03:24:55,069
I'm not sure the older ones know

4570
03:24:55,069 --> 03:24:57,990
they will remember the day is called

4571
03:24:57,990 --> 03:25:00,630
I don't know if it was because of that but I would have

4572
03:25:00,630 --> 03:25:03,811
a lot of sense because if with one

4573
03:25:03,811 --> 03:25:06,721
day then then do then until get

4574
03:25:06,721 --> 03:25:08,820
lots of information and change and change your

4575
03:25:08,820 --> 03:25:11,391
your knowledge exponentially

4576
03:25:11,391 --> 03:25:13,650
As I was telling you, patience is so

4577
03:25:13,650 --> 03:25:16,340
important this is 16 months and wait

4578
03:25:16,340 --> 03:25:18,601
right now the programs are more

4579
03:25:18,601 --> 03:25:21,990
nimble but still at least it's a

4580
03:25:21,990 --> 03:25:25,681
month three weeks of waiting and at the end of

4581
03:25:25,681 --> 03:25:27,450
that to repeat everything we saw

4582
03:25:27,450 --> 03:25:30,391
can repeat and throw identify things

4583
03:25:30,391 --> 03:25:34,641
that we want to change and start over

4584
03:25:35,060 --> 03:25:40,819
and well for my part it would be everything and many

4585
03:25:40,819 --> 03:25:43,850
Thanks for the opportunity, I'm attentive.

4586
03:25:43,850 --> 03:25:46,641
for your questions and

4587
03:25:46,641 --> 03:25:47,950
here in the

4588
03:25:47,950 --> 03:25:51,591
they left the talk yes of course man

4589
03:25:51,591 --> 03:25:53,811
thank you very much for your presentation

4590
03:25:53,811 --> 03:25:56,631
the truth is that very interesting

4591
03:25:56,631 --> 03:25:58,971
how you use this methodology

4592
03:25:58,971 --> 03:26:00,971
to find this kind of problems

4593
03:26:00,971 --> 03:26:02,811
indeed we have several questions

4594
03:26:02,811 --> 03:26:04,940
We are going to try to solve at least two

4595
03:26:04,940 --> 03:26:07,381
of them

4596
03:26:07,381 --> 03:26:09,150
and the rest of the steps by internal

4597
03:26:09,150 --> 03:26:11,311
so that if you can answer them in your

4598
03:26:11,311 --> 03:26:12,980
social media

4599
03:26:12,980 --> 03:26:16,440
there is one that talks a lot about your book

4600
03:26:16,440 --> 03:26:19,141
where can you find it if you go

4601
03:26:19,141 --> 03:26:22,650
to raffle someone who is good in general

4602
03:26:22,650 --> 03:26:24,900
So we can summarize several questions in

4603
03:26:24,900 --> 03:26:26,780
that

4604
03:26:26,780 --> 03:26:29,240
ok well you can find the book in

4605
03:26:29,240 --> 03:26:32,450
amazon is called one has spanish and

4606
03:26:32,450 --> 03:26:33,800
anyway i have it on my blog too

4607
03:26:33,800 --> 03:26:36,110
in nine months pino dotcom in

4608
03:26:36,110 --> 03:26:39,351
any link from my blog are the

4609
03:26:39,351 --> 03:26:41,840
links to the book something important is that

4610
03:26:41,840 --> 03:26:45,290
This is in Spanish and English at

4611
03:26:45,290 --> 03:26:47,511
At first I took it out in Spanish because it was

4612
03:26:47,511 --> 03:26:48,891
the idea because there was almost nothing in

4613
03:26:48,891 --> 03:26:50,931
Spanish and there were people who asked me

4614
03:26:50,931 --> 03:26:52,670
in English so I have it published in

4615
03:26:52,670 --> 03:26:55,400
the two and the raffle I think that if one

4616
03:26:55,400 --> 03:26:58,400
digital one digital there if you can

4617
03:26:58,400 --> 03:27:01,521
pass a list of those who

4618
03:27:01,521 --> 03:27:02,870
they attended the conference or something like that and

4619
03:27:02,870 --> 03:27:05,630
we make one that is a selection of

4620
03:27:05,630 --> 03:27:08,011
this random

4621
03:27:08,011 --> 03:27:11,791
and by doing this on your own social network

4622
03:27:11,791 --> 03:27:14,280
twitter are you going to put something related to

4623
03:27:14,280 --> 03:27:16,291
your book we send people to

4624
03:27:16,291 --> 03:27:18,421
to give it a retweet and the people who

4625
03:27:18,421 --> 03:27:21,061
make retweet of that publication they raffle

4626
03:27:21,061 --> 03:27:24,631
free, do you think it's going I'll remember later

4627
03:27:24,631 --> 03:27:29,520
a little later I do it this time

4628
03:27:29,520 --> 03:27:32,190
well

4629
03:27:32,190 --> 03:27:34,261
there is another question then specifically

4630
03:27:34,261 --> 03:27:35,910
about what you found that if the

4631
03:27:35,910 --> 03:27:37,261
three other failures also paid you

4632
03:27:37,261 --> 03:27:41,610
like rc yes yes all faults los

4633
03:27:41,610 --> 03:27:44,120
they will find they will pay them as you are but

4634
03:27:44,120 --> 03:27:46,950
as they were not in the domain of

4635
03:27:46,950 --> 03:27:48,760
Google com

4636
03:27:48,760 --> 03:27:52,029
the impact and the

4637
03:27:52,029 --> 03:27:53,850
Let's say

4638
03:27:53,850 --> 03:27:56,500
economic gain but if everyone

4639
03:27:56,500 --> 03:27:58,779
they paid the same pass was the same

4640
03:27:58,779 --> 03:28:00,380
issue

4641
03:28:00,380 --> 03:28:04,520
the last bullet you want the rich as

4642
03:28:04,520 --> 03:28:06,260
the main phase for the success of the

4643
03:28:06,260 --> 03:28:08,680
group not

4644
03:28:09,200 --> 03:28:13,110
it can be but hey it's a very part

4645
03:28:13,110 --> 03:28:15,391
important and probably the

4646
03:28:15,391 --> 03:28:16,490
principal

4647
03:28:16,490 --> 03:28:19,141
but for example there are others

4648
03:28:19,141 --> 03:28:21,690
researchers that their focus is that

4649
03:28:21,690 --> 03:28:23,460
they are going to

4650
03:28:23,460 --> 03:28:25,650
to say the case of this one from google.com

4651
03:28:25,650 --> 03:28:28,560
they go to google.com directly and not

4652
03:28:28,560 --> 03:28:30,870
They get out of there and start testing.

4653
03:28:30,870 --> 03:28:34,410
based on a google search for

4654
03:28:34,410 --> 03:28:37,830
example or google filters and it goes away

4655
03:28:37,830 --> 03:28:40,290
live a day let's say to the bull for

4656
03:28:40,290 --> 03:28:42,200
the horns' is not the application itself

4657
03:28:42,200 --> 03:28:45,720
that is his approach in this case and for me

4658
03:28:45,720 --> 03:28:47,910
personally if the recognition is

4659
03:28:47,910 --> 03:28:50,130
one of the most important phases but I have

4660
03:28:50,130 --> 03:28:52,820
been trying to change that that

4661
03:28:52,820 --> 03:28:55,680
let's say mentality and try to search

4662
03:28:55,680 --> 03:28:56,660
stuff

4663
03:28:56,660 --> 03:28:59,610
directly in a fact application

4664
03:28:59,610 --> 03:29:01,740
there is an example of a bug that

4665
03:29:01,740 --> 03:29:03,630
I found on google+ the one that basically

4666
03:29:03,630 --> 03:29:07,380
It's like a programming idea with

4667
03:29:07,380 --> 03:29:09,810
a linux shell that google has

4668
03:29:09,810 --> 03:29:11,970
gives it to you for free for having your account

4669
03:29:11,970 --> 03:29:13,950
from google and for example in this case

4670
03:29:13,950 --> 03:29:16,530
particular was no does not say anything

4671
03:29:16,530 --> 03:29:18,930
acknowledgment then directly in this

4672
03:29:18,930 --> 03:29:20,729
app i stayed in this app

4673
03:29:20,729 --> 03:29:23,301
three days until I found something that

4674
03:29:23,301 --> 03:29:26,570
the one that can make her vulnerable

4675
03:29:26,570 --> 03:29:28,701
It depends, it depends, but in general, yes.

4676
03:29:28,701 --> 03:29:30,320
of the first things or when one

4677
03:29:30,320 --> 03:29:31,881
Recognition has just begun

4678
03:29:31,881 --> 03:29:33,510
the most important

4679
03:29:33,510 --> 03:29:35,700
I think the important thing is that I don't know

4680
03:29:35,700 --> 03:29:37,770
get stuck in the stage of

4681
03:29:37,770 --> 03:29:39,120
recognition because I believe that a lot

4682
03:29:39,120 --> 03:29:40,609
people become experts treat

4683
03:29:40,609 --> 03:29:43,649
automate tries to filter and at the end

4684
03:29:43,649 --> 03:29:47,580
this is just the tip

4685
03:29:47,580 --> 03:29:49,560
of the air to find something that

4686
03:29:49,560 --> 03:29:50,760
catch your eye and start looking

4687
03:29:50,760 --> 03:29:53,370
failures if it only makes a record they will never go to you

4688
03:29:53,370 --> 03:29:55,620
to pay nothing if you find no fault with

4689
03:29:55,620 --> 03:29:57,569
he recognizes himself tara to win then

4690
03:29:57,569 --> 03:29:59,670
like they don't get stuck in rich

4691
03:29:59,670 --> 03:30:02,310
in but if it is very important of course

4692
03:30:02,310 --> 03:30:04,979
correct totally agree good a

4693
03:30:04,979 --> 03:30:06,300
see I have the public for you

4694
03:30:06,300 --> 03:30:08,370
say goodbye and we can continue with the

4695
03:30:08,370 --> 03:30:10,890
event schedule that many

4696

4697

and as Jaime mentioned we are going to give a

4698
03:30:15,810 --> 03:30:17,160
digital book

4699
03:30:17,160 --> 03:30:19,319
in a moment more since busy month the

4700
03:30:19,319 --> 03:30:22,140
things I will publish and I will carve

4701
03:30:22,140 --> 03:30:25,680
work and it's going to be done let's say the

4702
03:30:25,680 --> 03:30:28,229
raffle among the retweets of this life and

4703
03:30:28,229 --> 03:30:30,000
many thanks for everything

4704
03:30:30,000 --> 03:30:32,790
active thank you very much continuing

4705
03:30:32,790 --> 03:30:33,900
then with our programming

4706
03:30:33,900 --> 03:30:36,540
next we have mateo martínez

4707
03:30:36,540 --> 03:30:39,180
he comes from uruguay and he is going to talk to us a

4708
03:30:39,180 --> 03:30:41,160
little about security issues

4709
03:30:41,160 --> 03:30:43,410
which is located in the dependencies 220

4710
03:30:43,410 --> 03:30:45,000
shows ah but Martin in his

4711
03:30:45,000 --> 03:30:46,200
professional reconstruction of the

4712
03:30:46,200 --> 03:30:48,090
computer security that has already been

4713
03:30:48,090 --> 03:30:49,580
in various editions of our event

4714
03:30:49,580 --> 03:30:52,140
when it is in person when it is done

4715
03:30:52,140 --> 03:30:54,270
online and the truth is that it is a

4716

4723
03:31:10,860 --> 03:31:12,210
who have done as a community what they have

4724
03:31:12,210 --> 03:31:13,771

4726
03:31:15,511 --> 03:31:17,700

03:31:21,900 --> 03:31:23,460

4730
03:31:23,460 --> 03:31:25,830
thanks to my crisis' actions

4731
03:31:25,830 --> 03:31:28,880
get active march thank you

4732
03:31:50,649 --> 03:31:53,050
well he continued with the filtration to

4733
03:31:53,050 --> 03:31:55,060
less than subjects of thanks from

4734
03:31:55,060 --> 03:31:57,069
affiliations will never be enough

4735
03:31:57,069 --> 03:31:58,989
when they are doing I think everyone

4736
03:31:58,989 --> 03:32:00,130
professionals vicious if ever

4737
03:32:00,130 --> 03:32:02,919
we saw news develop well

4738
03:32:02,919 --> 03:32:05,050
expert insights motivated us to learn

4739
03:32:05,050 --> 03:32:07,840
some theme and lara that yes share

4740
03:32:07,840 --> 03:32:10,149
since the piety edition was criticized with

4741
03:32:10,149 --> 03:32:11,949
denounce phrases for me it is also

4742
03:32:11,949 --> 03:32:14,319
an honor always a pleasure every time with

4743
03:32:14,319 --> 03:32:17,380
the whitest hair jaime so it is

4744
03:32:17,380 --> 03:32:19,569
It really shows that years have passed

4745
03:32:19,569 --> 03:32:21,159
since the prediction we were all

4746
03:32:21,159 --> 03:32:23,439
with even darker hair after

4747
03:32:23,439 --> 03:32:25,239
receiving sponsors so that

4748
03:32:25,239 --> 03:32:27,729
the effort wanting the events is

4749
03:32:27,729 --> 03:32:28,989
extremely important but you have to

4750
03:32:28,989 --> 03:32:30,550
thank the sponsors who do

4751
03:32:30,550 --> 03:32:32,319
and allow others to take too

4752
03:32:32,319 --> 03:32:34,060
the shape the size of professionalism

4753
03:32:34,060 --> 03:32:35,949
that they have so that each of them does not

4754
03:32:35,949 --> 03:32:38,319
and me when I saw on the website of

4755
03:32:38,319 --> 03:32:40,209
the sponsors in this that I liked

4756
03:32:40,209 --> 03:32:42,069
show that he appears so humble there

4757
03:32:42,069 --> 03:32:44,680
below that the two creators are the

4758
03:32:44,680 --> 03:32:46,779
motivators all this in being on top of

4759
03:32:46,779 --> 03:32:48,789
everyone so make that big task

4760
03:32:48,789 --> 03:32:50,859
as as a company one knows what

4761
03:32:50,859 --> 03:32:53,199
collaborate as a community and entered into

4762
03:32:53,199 --> 03:32:55,119
the conference and obviously the

4763
03:32:55,119 --> 03:32:57,010
sponsors that make this possible

4764
03:32:57,010 --> 03:32:58,510
my part stopped thinking a little my

4765
03:32:58,510 --> 03:33:01,140
biography for those who don't know me

4766
03:33:01,140 --> 03:33:04,390
don't you martínez I'm working on

4767
03:33:04,390 --> 03:33:05,890
a thousand people and ways to do it no

4768
03:33:05,890 --> 03:33:07,990
I have a long way to go

4769
03:33:07,990 --> 03:33:10,689
still no more computer television and

4770
03:33:10,689 --> 03:33:12,760
computer engineers and with some

4771
03:33:12,760 --> 03:33:15,040
market certifications of how it's done

4772
03:33:15,040 --> 03:33:18,040
and between the iso standards I am a teacher in the

4773
03:33:18,040 --> 03:33:21,399
monterrey tec in utrecht florida as

4774
03:33:21,399 --> 03:33:22,840
in paraguay nor tested and in the

4775
03:33:22,840 --> 03:33:24,520
ort university uruguay diploma

4776
03:33:24,520 --> 03:33:26,770
help security that is just that

4777
03:33:26,770 --> 03:33:29,319
daily coordinates situations a

4778
03:33:29,319 --> 03:33:31,210
industry in Uruguay and with that the

4779
03:33:31,210 --> 03:33:32,590
founder of two companies create more

4780
03:33:32,590 --> 03:33:34,479
hacking I come from Colombia that's the

4781
03:33:34,479 --> 03:33:36,819
place in uruguay that you saw some topics

4782
03:33:36,819 --> 03:33:39,100
anti that explains that to us only as

4783
03:33:39,100 --> 03:33:40,870
plantation after I think they have

4784
03:33:40,870 --> 03:33:42,310
talked a lot but always without topics

4785
03:33:42,310 --> 03:33:44,680
to work professional ethics is what

4786
03:33:44,680 --> 03:33:46,210
What makes us today professionals

4787
03:33:46,210 --> 03:33:48,160
this let's say this more than anything to

4788
03:33:48,160 --> 03:33:49,840
those who are starting out in there is a

4789
03:33:49,840 --> 03:33:50,770
road

4790
03:33:50,770 --> 03:33:52,200
extremely

4791
03:33:52,200 --> 03:33:54,520
interesting in terms of security with

4792
03:33:54,520 --> 03:33:56,319
which work on this issue of ethics

4793
03:33:56,319 --> 03:33:58,810
good morals they manage to do professionals

4794
03:33:58,810 --> 03:34:00,609
considerable in and I think that doing the

4795
03:34:00,609 --> 03:34:01,840
difference in the market so

4796
03:34:01,840 --> 03:34:03,580
work on these issues

4797
03:34:03,580 --> 03:34:06,340
just from behavioral issues watching the

4798
03:34:06,340 --> 03:34:08,830
respect to have patience really

4799
03:34:08,830 --> 03:34:10,900
part and what professionals do today in

4800
03:34:10,900 --> 03:34:13,870
seriously and now check out the introduction and

4801
03:34:13,870 --> 03:34:15,340
I'm going to talk a little about what they are

4802
03:34:15,340 --> 03:34:17,470
dependencies in particular to have their

4803
03:34:17,470 --> 03:34:19,390
sensors I like this image a lot

4804
03:34:19,390 --> 03:34:21,280
general but it is a drawing that explains

4805
03:34:21,280 --> 03:34:22,600
almost all the problems we have in

4806
03:34:22,600 --> 03:34:25,061
day we always have legacy projects or

4807
03:34:25,061 --> 03:34:26,350
projects that we have created in another

4808
03:34:26,350 --> 03:34:28,530
moment put five or six years ago

4809
03:34:28,530 --> 03:34:31,350
those pieces the software we want

4810
03:34:31,350 --> 03:34:33,850
to say that he has many problems

4811
03:34:33,850 --> 03:34:35,800
many bugs and ropey is something since

4812
03:34:35,800 --> 03:34:37,510
zero well to make it clean but no

4813
03:34:37,510 --> 03:34:39,040
have problems so that he does not bring us

4814
03:34:39,040 --> 03:34:40,630
no complications and what do we do

4815
03:34:40,630 --> 03:34:42,760
we take pieces we always use pieces

4816
03:34:42,760 --> 03:34:45,280
that's that castle we had

4817
03:34:45,280 --> 03:34:48,510
full of bugs and our new project

4818
03:34:48,510 --> 03:34:51,490
always start with community problems

4819
03:34:51,490 --> 03:34:53,860
and others later that we add in the

4820
03:34:53,860 --> 03:34:57,340
subject of copy and paste really being

4821
03:34:57,340 --> 03:34:58,960
unlikely we could survive with

4822
03:34:58,960 --> 03:35:00,700
control is controlled and from there

4823
03:35:00,700 --> 03:35:02,650
some additional extra but it is a

4824
03:35:02,650 --> 03:35:04,570
fabulous tool there are some very

4825
03:35:04,570 --> 03:35:06,370
interesting how to cocker and paste from

4826
03:35:06,370 --> 03:35:09,160
stack overflow as villar message from

4827
03:35:09,160 --> 03:35:10,600
mistake I also recommend them so that

4828
03:35:10,600 --> 03:35:13,990
are starting on the subject and then

4829
03:35:13,990 --> 03:35:16,930
If the problem is the time you have

4830
03:35:16,930 --> 03:35:19,420
Defender I am with though something that

4831
03:35:19,420 --> 03:35:22,149
Collaborate helps us to make the software

4832
03:35:22,149 --> 03:35:23,790
faster develop

4833
03:35:23,790 --> 03:35:26,410
and well these types of names

4834
03:35:26,410 --> 03:35:28,210
applications with some dependencies

4835
03:35:28,210 --> 03:35:31,420
well every time does follow even this

4836
03:35:31,420 --> 03:35:33,729
resource of bookstores or part of the

4837
03:35:33,729 --> 03:35:35,530
project as part of the efficiency that

4838
03:35:35,530 --> 03:35:37,899
we have the problem happens with these

4839
03:35:37,899 --> 03:35:40,840
values ​​not that 85% the components are

4840
03:35:40,840 --> 03:35:42,550
outdated good inclusions

4841
03:35:42,550 --> 03:35:44,170
updated more than four years with what

4842
03:35:44,170 --> 03:35:44,880
which

4843
03:35:44,880 --> 03:35:47,050
let you see those components extremely

4844
03:35:47,050 --> 03:35:49,450
vulnerable in many times without a

4845
03:35:49,450 --> 03:35:51,220
follow-up of the same with which it is

4846
03:35:51,220 --> 03:35:53,710
a timely and attack well and

4847
03:35:53,710 --> 03:35:56,890
obviously must work on security

4848
03:35:56,890 --> 03:35:59,319
after this we add a

4849
03:35:59,319 --> 03:36:01,029
problem that is good there is

4850
03:36:01,029 --> 03:36:03,200
tools today that allow

4851
03:36:03,200 --> 03:36:05,300
or databases that allow us

4852
03:36:05,300 --> 03:36:09,050
investigate when a cb arises when

4853
03:36:09,050 --> 03:36:10,720
an apathy 9 appears in a dependency

4854
03:36:10,720 --> 03:36:12,860
Now I'm going to dig a little deeper into that.

4855
03:36:12,860 --> 03:36:14,840
but the truth is that since I came out a

4856
03:36:14,840 --> 03:36:16,550
ally is that it is until the same

4857
03:36:16,550 --> 03:36:18,920
it has its cd and its encoding its

4858
03:36:18,920 --> 03:36:21,410
identity the only one happens not that is and in the

4859
03:36:21,410 --> 03:36:24,380
case of 9 for example 50 54 days in

4860
03:36:24,380 --> 03:36:26,561
average good for it to be published

4861
03:36:26,561 --> 03:36:29,660
this is good if we compare it with what

4862
03:36:29,660 --> 03:36:30,980
it can take development of an exploit

4863
03:36:30,980 --> 03:36:33,320
in front of a new unit we talk about days

4864
03:36:33,320 --> 03:36:35,320
we talk about weeks we talk about hours

4865
03:36:35,320 --> 03:36:37,580
leaves an exposure and dental at risk

4866
03:36:37,580 --> 03:36:40,250
very wide ok then sometimes

4867
03:36:40,250 --> 03:36:42,080
we talked about that for more than a month well

4868
03:36:42,080 --> 03:36:43,940
then the risk where the

4869
03:36:43,940 --> 03:36:47,090
exploit and yet it is not on cd or not

4870
03:36:47,090 --> 03:36:48,920
is the public the authority as such

4871
03:36:48,920 --> 03:36:51,080
with an identifier and many

4872
03:36:51,080 --> 03:36:53,780
tools what they do is go and search

4873
03:36:53,780 --> 03:36:56,570
these in this database to define

4874
03:36:56,570 --> 03:36:58,010
if he is vulnerable, not since we speak

4875
03:36:58,010 --> 03:37:00,561
is for simplicity of recognition

4876
03:37:00,561 --> 03:37:02,601
men that is to say well there is some seen

4877
03:37:02,601 --> 03:37:06,040
there is some basis there is something and maybe

4878
03:37:06,040 --> 03:37:07,909
after

4879
03:37:07,909 --> 03:37:11,409
in the community is discovered the

4880
03:37:11,409 --> 03:37:13,850
which opens a very wide window before

4881
03:37:13,850 --> 03:37:15,409
what the tools will put vs.

4882
03:37:15,409 --> 03:37:18,350
what can be achieved by a researcher or a

4883
03:37:18,350 --> 03:37:20,179
analyst or air through god given today

4884
03:37:20,179 --> 03:37:23,690
who is looking for tools in attack

4885
03:37:23,690 --> 03:37:25,881
So where are we in the day and

4886
03:37:25,881 --> 03:37:27,171
the international context that also

4887
03:37:27,171 --> 03:37:29,240
always interesting in this context

4888
03:37:29,240 --> 03:37:32,811
and there I always appear in the

4889
03:37:32,811 --> 03:37:34,011
current situation we must talk about the

4890
03:37:34,011 --> 03:37:36,460
situation with ukraine without a doubt well that

4891
03:37:36,460 --> 03:37:40,070
began to see how two sides and Ukraine

4892
03:37:40,070 --> 03:37:41,290
with his

4893
03:37:41,290 --> 03:37:44,091
cyber army of which he sought an interest in

4894
03:37:44,091 --> 03:37:45,950
global level and we began to skate

4895
03:37:45,950 --> 03:37:47,811
begins to make attacks not in what is

4896
03:37:47,811 --> 03:37:49,580
infrastructure of russia russia for its

4897
03:37:49,580 --> 03:37:51,351
party for years attacking ukraine

4898
03:37:51,351 --> 03:37:53,601
from electoral issues to issues of

4899
03:37:53,601 --> 03:37:55,790
critical infrastructure good and good

4900
03:37:55,790 --> 03:37:57,860
clean everything in that situation

4901
03:37:57,860 --> 03:38:00,290
affected sales to suppliers and affected

4902
03:38:00,290 --> 03:38:03,171
already to different organizations and he in

4903
03:38:03,171 --> 03:38:04,551
service nation themes saying guy

4904
03:38:04,551 --> 03:38:06,051
of aspects of attack is inclusive has

4905
03:38:06,051 --> 03:38:07,431
fact that some hosting providers

4906
03:38:07,431 --> 03:38:09,830
For example, they were in cities like

4907
03:38:09,830 --> 03:38:11,601
this mass have had to change their

4908
03:38:11,601 --> 03:38:14,061
equipment and then for the

4909
03:38:14,061 --> 03:38:15,950
more regional situations not the issue of

4910
03:38:15,950 --> 03:38:18,710
costa rica have paralyzed the government in

4911
03:38:18,710 --> 03:38:21,650
crisis situation have issues such as

4912
03:38:21,650 --> 03:38:23,511
of the app its themes of attacks to

4913
03:38:23,511 --> 03:38:26,660
companies triplings for this

4914
03:38:26,660 --> 03:38:28,409
keep moving forward

4915
03:38:28,409 --> 03:38:31,000
we see more and more viral attacks themes

4916
03:38:31,000 --> 03:38:35,409
like the one from the uber where sometimes

4917
03:38:35,409 --> 03:38:37,600
Not clear how to respond to

4918
03:38:37,600 --> 03:38:40,029
attacks on how to respond to the press

4919
03:38:40,029 --> 03:38:41,859
how you respond to situations sometimes

4920
03:38:41,859 --> 03:38:43,870
things that happened a couple of years ago and

4921
03:38:43,870 --> 03:38:45,729
I know also writing like it was a

4922
03:38:45,729 --> 03:38:48,279
functionality is not a file not the

4923
03:38:48,279 --> 03:38:50,620
great phrase we have on the matter

4924
03:38:50,620 --> 03:38:52,449
just from incident reports

4925
03:38:52,449 --> 03:38:56,609
regularities after then too

4926
03:38:56,609 --> 03:38:59,290
regional on the run in mercadolibre

4927
03:38:59,290 --> 03:39:02,560
What more than obviously visiting the

4928
03:39:02,560 --> 03:39:04,600
pandemic remote work led to

4929
03:39:04,600 --> 03:39:06,939
also the use of these houses have

4930
03:39:06,939 --> 03:39:09,970
be affected well and in taking advantage of

4931
03:39:09,970 --> 03:39:11,710
all those who were also with the

4932
03:39:11,710 --> 03:39:12,640
same controls that had the

4933
03:39:12,640 --> 03:39:14,800
organizations and that ends up being good

4934
03:39:14,800 --> 03:39:16,880
hoaxes and scams

4935
03:39:16,880 --> 03:39:20,130
and within the text it is impossible not to talk about

4936
03:39:20,130 --> 03:39:23,280
for six than a unit too

4937
03:39:23,280 --> 03:39:24,930
dependencies that made us all run

4938
03:39:24,930 --> 03:39:27,120
in the complete market had to be

4939
03:39:27,120 --> 03:39:28,891
search good which providers using

4940
03:39:28,891 --> 03:39:31,380
the gay doctor and in what products that

4941
03:39:31,380 --> 03:39:33,630
we use that project how to start

4942
03:39:33,630 --> 03:39:35,670
to tell the different brands well

4943
03:39:35,670 --> 03:39:37,590
with our suppliers or in our

4944
03:39:37,590 --> 03:39:39,630
behind networks where it was then by law

4945
03:39:39,630 --> 03:39:41,851
And how did we mitigate this?

4946
03:39:41,851 --> 03:39:44,641
be able to make some kind of improvement to

4947
03:39:44,641 --> 03:39:47,521
remedy the unit well whereupon a

4948
03:39:47,521 --> 03:39:49,830
good review that had everything in check

4949
03:39:49,830 --> 03:39:53,460
the market that good based on the other of

4950
03:39:53,460 --> 03:39:55,320
smoke that showed this other to me not

4951
03:39:55,320 --> 03:39:56,851
I find it interesting that he explains a

4952
03:39:56,851 --> 03:39:59,370
little that cause day and it is not

4953
03:39:59,370 --> 03:40:00,811
exactly the case of the king mushroom but

4954
03:40:00,811 --> 03:40:02,400
yes for many glories we use no

4955
03:40:02,400 --> 03:40:05,220
we have a great project

4956
03:40:05,220 --> 03:40:08,101
solution to internal commercial as

4957
03:40:08,101 --> 03:40:09,870
be and we have a small dependency

4958
03:40:09,870 --> 03:40:11,940
opensource that maintains it to someone

4959
03:40:11,940 --> 03:40:14,181
since some year well

4960
03:40:14,181 --> 03:40:16,940
and how is this example and in 2003 there is

4961
03:40:16,940 --> 03:40:19,190
in the fridge to a single person who

4962
03:40:19,190 --> 03:40:21,141
manages and maintains that bookstore that

4963
03:40:21,141 --> 03:40:23,030
becomes critical our platform is

4964
03:40:23,030 --> 03:40:25,311
that small pillar that separates a reason

4965
03:40:25,311 --> 03:40:27,381
who makes the whole fall down is lost

4966
03:40:27,381 --> 03:40:29,601
platform then a little iron

4967
03:40:29,601 --> 03:40:31,311
it ends up being to say well let's work

4968
03:40:31,311 --> 03:40:32,530
on that little pine forest that is there

4969
03:40:32,530 --> 03:40:35,240
abandoned and you can see the different

4970
03:40:35,240 --> 03:40:37,581
perspectives on one side to give you

4971
03:40:37,581 --> 03:40:40,161
security in the organization for topics

4972
03:40:40,161 --> 03:40:41,841
from bach band and as well speaking well

4973
03:40:41,841 --> 03:40:43,851
It is also a place to attend and work

4974
03:40:43,851 --> 03:40:46,431
Now it is to demonstrate a small case and

4975
03:40:46,431 --> 03:40:48,351
obviously from the tasks side of

4976
03:40:48,351 --> 03:40:50,181
If you don't think so, that will also help us

4977
03:40:50,181 --> 03:40:52,101
work and analyze what the other has

4978
03:40:52,101 --> 03:40:55,940
good side then of what is current and

4979
03:40:55,940 --> 03:40:58,070
from bs cops well today it begins

4980
03:40:58,070 --> 03:40:59,811
work in legalized environments than in

4981
03:40:59,811 --> 03:41:01,730
which these little blocks too

4982
03:41:01,730 --> 03:41:04,371
each one of those blocks that brings us

4983
03:41:04,371 --> 03:41:06,200
dependencies do not strangle ities and

4984
03:41:06,200 --> 03:41:08,150
we talk about solutions of course

4985
03:41:08,150 --> 03:41:10,221
third-party component microservices

4986
03:41:10,221 --> 03:41:12,381
infrastructure as a service

4987
03:41:12,381 --> 03:41:13,280
the truth that we began to add

4988
03:41:13,280 --> 03:41:15,351
leaders of energies and each one has

4989
03:41:15,351 --> 03:41:16,761
some kind of constant dependency

4990
03:41:16,761 --> 03:41:19,220
being within this concept

4991
03:41:19,220 --> 03:41:21,529
in the efes will arrive as soon as possible

4992
03:41:21,529 --> 03:41:24,200
software development security

4993
03:41:24,200 --> 03:41:26,090
it becomes important to work and add what

4994
03:41:26,090 --> 03:41:28,279
theme of piluso bookstores well and

4995
03:41:28,279 --> 03:41:31,130
dependencies then today the elect of

4996
03:41:31,130 --> 03:41:32,510
dobbs teams wanted a change

4997
03:41:32,510 --> 03:41:34,580
cultural generate a transformation

4998
03:41:34,580 --> 03:41:36,830
speed a job what was had on

4999
03:41:36,830 --> 03:41:38,840
cascade investigations but

5000
03:41:38,840 --> 03:41:40,310
It also requires automating

5001
03:41:40,310 --> 03:41:42,620


5002
03:41:42,620 --> 03:41:45,109


5003
03:41:45,109 --> 03:41:46,520
