00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:18,330
work with him a lot on this work and we

5
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:21,869
actually recently presented at RSA 2017

6
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:25,049
on some work so I'm a scientist that

7
00:00:21,869 --> 00:00:28,080
nobody think I do usually involved in a

8
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:29,670
lot of bio computing work I have a lot

00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:33,690
of background in bioinformatics and

10

00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:20,340
approach that leverages a lot of

28
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:21,990
techniques from deception and even from

29
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:24,720
the malware community to protect

31
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:33,630
so that's how<font color="#CCCCCC"> available at on youtube on</font>

our essays channel so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm what I'll be</font>

general<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk and I kind of I'll go more</font>

39
00:01:51,869 --> 00:01:58,799
into the details and in this one so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll</font>

40
00:01:57,090 --> 00:02:00,270
give a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of background on the problem</font>

41
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:02,369
we're kind of trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to solve like going</font>

42
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:06,570
to the the main scenarios we're looking

43
00:02:02,369 --> 00:02:09,598
at the first one we return kind of the

44
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:12,629
golden ticket this is where the attacker

45
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:13,510
has gained access to your file system is

46
00:02:12,629 --> 00:02:15,700
trying to echo

47
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:18,489
<font color="#CCCCCC">tree as many files as possible I'm kind</font>

48
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:20,649
<font color="#CCCCCC">of straightforward right a lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of cases</font>

49
00:02:18,489 --> 00:02:23,349
I use simple tools like<font color="#CCCCCC"> double you get</font>

50
00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:25,299
for example or curl and<font color="#E5E5E5"> and once they</font>

51
00:02:23,349 --> 00:02:28,480
have all the privileges<font color="#E5E5E5"> they they can</font>

52
00:02:25,299 --> 00:02:31,690
make out like a bandit and the main

53
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:33,488
point here is that each file right all

54
00:02:31,690 --> 00:02:35,379
your files on<font color="#E5E5E5"> your on your system right</font>

55
00:02:33,489 --> 00:02:38,709
there of like heterogeneous type and

56
00:02:35,379 --> 00:02:41,828
structure right the main point here is

57
00:02:38,709 --> 00:02:44,019
that each file has different value to

58
00:02:41,829 --> 00:02:46,299
the attacker the attacker is going to be

59
00:02:44,019 --> 00:02:49,269
more interested in<font color="#CCCCCC"> our medical</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> records</font>

60
00:02:46,299 --> 00:02:50,200
right or secret documents for example

61
00:02:49,269 --> 00:02:54,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">right they're not going to care about</font>

62
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:56,920
the the corporate picnic flyer and so on

63
00:02:54,069 --> 00:03:00,099
my reason for pointing this<font color="#CCCCCC"> out will be</font>

64
00:02:56,920 --> 00:03:03,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">apparent shortly so under the second</font>

65
00:03:00,099 --> 00:03:07,149
scenario this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a we term the PII cept</font>

66
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:10,030
case there is the classic attacker has

67
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:12,340
gained access<font color="#E5E5E5"> to your</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> database is doing</font>

68
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:13,930
a select all and then just dumping

69
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:17,590
everything on a pace of insight<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

70
00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:20,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">example in this case the main difference</font>

71
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:23,019
<font color="#CCCCCC">is that since the objects that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are being</font>

72
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:25,419
accelerated our database records from a

73
00:03:23,019 --> 00:03:27,849
<font color="#E5E5E5">table I'm so everything structured</font>

74
00:03:25,419 --> 00:03:31,389
similarly right it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> very easy for them</font>

75
00:03:27,849 --> 00:03:32,798
to parts and whatnot and probably more

76
00:03:31,389 --> 00:03:37,629
likely than not there are going to have

77
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:43,060
the uniform value to the attacker and so

78
00:03:37,629 --> 00:03:47,560
the the point is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we we redevelop</font>

79
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:49,989
our approach that depends on simulations

80
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:54,040
right we play adversarial games right we

81
00:03:49,989 --> 00:03:57,190
kind of model attack on networks and the

82
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:58,989
what's important when doing so is that

83
00:03:57,190 --> 00:04:00,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">we want to model the payoff to the</font>

84
00:03:58,989 --> 00:04:02,949
attacker so it's important to consider

85
00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:05,108
how much something an object is worth on

86
00:04:02,949 --> 00:04:08,470
your system when you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of setting</font>

87
00:04:05,109 --> 00:04:13,389
up a defensive system like I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

88
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:15,669
talk about shortly so I'm traditionally

89
00:04:13,389 --> 00:04:18,280
you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of like the the static</font>

90
00:04:15,669 --> 00:04:21,579
different approach this is where an

91
00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:24,669
analyst is looking at<font color="#CCCCCC"> Network behavior</font>

92
00:04:21,579 --> 00:04:27,040
and what they do<font color="#E5E5E5"> is they'll select an</font>

93
00:04:24,669 --> 00:04:29,289
arbitrary threshold and say like any

94
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:31,540
spike in network traffic above this

95
00:04:29,290 --> 00:04:35,650
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to say is weird and we're</font>

96
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:37,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">going to raise an alarm we also consider</font>

97
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:39,849
the fact that most<font color="#CCCCCC"> likely in malicious</font>

98
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:43,060
activity is going to be encrypted so

99
00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:45,220
deep packet inspection is not an option

100
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:48,490
and so we don't consider it<font color="#E5E5E5"> in our</font>

101
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:51,040
approach<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we don't really need to so</font>

102
00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:53,620
here we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have the same view more of a</font>

103
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:56,500
schematic view apparent like the<font color="#CCCCCC"> pii</font>

104
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:59,980
case attacker has compromised the host

105
00:04:56,500 --> 00:05:03,460
is trying to do a select star here the

106
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:07,390
analyst on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> my magnifying glass here</font>

107
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:09,789
they selected a threshold right but the

108
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:13,719
<font color="#E5E5E5">problem with this is that the attacker</font>

109
00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:15,820
is able to exploit automation right they

110
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:18,190
have all the time in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> world they can</font>

111
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:20,110
fraud all their transfer speeds and they

112
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:23,740
can just lay low and they pretty much

113
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:26,170
win they have succeeded in stealing all

114
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:30,310
of your data and it has gone undetected

115
00:05:26,170 --> 00:05:33,430
at the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> time since you have a static</font>

116
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:36,520
threshold right you fall<font color="#CCCCCC"> into the base</font>

117
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:39,640
rate fallacy this is where you have a

118
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:42,130
low probability event and you're testing

119
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:44,140
this frequently you have so many events

120
00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:46,150
on<font color="#CCCCCC"> your network that over a long period</font>

121
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:48,400
of time you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to get so many</font>

122
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:50,200
false positive alerts right these are

123
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:53,289
<font color="#CCCCCC">just typical users on your network</font>

124
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:56,050
downloading big files or whatnot and so

125
00:05:53,290 --> 00:06:00,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">that puts a lot of stress on the analyst</font>

126
00:05:56,050 --> 00:06:05,770
rate you want to focus your attention on

127
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:09,280
relevant kind of alarms<font color="#E5E5E5"> right and so our</font>

128
00:06:05,770 --> 00:06:13,210
solution to this um we want to maximize

129
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:15,429
the analyst attention on like only<font color="#E5E5E5"> real</font>

130
00:06:13,210 --> 00:06:18,909
potential threats and the way we do that

131
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:20,440
is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we take a dynamic approach that</font>

132
00:06:18,910 --> 00:06:26,440
incorporates a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of elements from</font>

133
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:30,280
deception what we did when we were

134
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:32,590
starting out with its research right we

135
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:35,890
kind of picked a<font color="#CCCCCC"> very basic approach</font>

136
00:06:32,590 --> 00:06:38,320
right what if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can model attack and</font>

137
00:06:35,890 --> 00:06:41,710
based off modeling attacks

138
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:43,900
we can therefore kind of simulate I'm an

139
00:06:41,710 --> 00:06:46,510
estimate how many resources we need to

140
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:48,669
put in our deceptive techniques right we

141
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:51,250
can model costs that we have to pay to

142
00:06:48,670 --> 00:06:54,160
defend ourselves and we can model the

143
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:56,410
cost to the attacker as well and the way

144
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:59,470
we do that is that we can determine

145
00:06:56,410 --> 00:07:02,350
based off your own network signature

146
00:06:59,470 --> 00:07:05,950
right how big can we make our files

147
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:07,900
right so we make our files so big to the

148
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:10,570
point where it becomes intractable for

149
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:12,549
them to take<font color="#CCCCCC"> it off your system right</font>

150
00:07:10,570 --> 00:07:16,780
and not only that we<font color="#CCCCCC"> also generate a lot</font>

151
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:18,460
of decoys right the attacker right

152
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:21,099
doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really have time to kind of</font>

153
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:24,940
slips through what's real or not they

154
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:26,620
don't know like a priori like what is

155
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:30,130
like the junk data we<font color="#CCCCCC"> filled these files</font>

156
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:33,460
with or<font color="#E5E5E5"> not and so whenever they try to</font>

157
00:07:30,130 --> 00:07:36,010
for example going back to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the previous</font>

158
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:38,560
approach<font color="#E5E5E5"> having under the previous</font>

159
00:07:36,010 --> 00:07:40,780
schematic right we kind of want to push

160
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:43,150
malicious activity like above this

161
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:46,210
threshold we want to make something a

162
00:07:43,150 --> 00:07:48,789
weird event look really weird<font color="#CCCCCC"> and so</font>

163
00:07:46,210 --> 00:07:51,190
this kind of helps us focus our

164
00:07:48,790 --> 00:07:56,740
attention right and are different our

165
00:07:51,190 --> 00:07:58,240
system when we do these simulations you

166
00:07:56,740 --> 00:08:01,000
know you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> you might be asking like</font>

167
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:03,310
why why do I want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to sacrifice this</font>

168
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:05,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">space to cause up my</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sauce with all this</font>

169
00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:07,720
information<font color="#E5E5E5"> whether all this junk data</font>

170
00:08:05,890 --> 00:08:08,770
right and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that that's another key</font>

171
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:12,640
thing we look<font color="#E5E5E5"> there and I will</font>

172
00:08:08,770 --> 00:08:14,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">demonstrate shortly it's Adam we want to</font>

173
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:17,979
minimize impact to the user as well so

174
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:21,370
all<font color="#E5E5E5"> this can be made trans transparent</font>

175
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:24,370
to the user right and so kind of here

176
00:08:21,370 --> 00:08:27,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of like a this also shows kind</font>

177
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:29,680
of how our simulation works right a we

178
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:32,890
model an attack kind of implementing our

179
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:37,210
system so the attacker trying to grab as

180
00:08:32,890 --> 00:08:39,250
many records as they can however on see

181
00:08:37,210 --> 00:08:41,530
if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we see the dollar sign symbol here</font>

182
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:43,780
those are like<font color="#E5E5E5"> the real files right but</font>

183
00:08:41,530 --> 00:08:46,030
we flood the database table or the file

184
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:48,100
system with so many decoys and we

185
00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:49,839
inflate them to such a big size<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if</font>

186
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:52,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">they try to take everything all at once</font>

187
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:54,310
it's going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to make a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> very big obvious</font>

188
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,720
if we try to take everything<font color="#CCCCCC"> over a long</font>

189
00:08:54,310 --> 00:08:59,530
period of time it's never going to

190
00:08:55,720 --> 00:09:01,870
finish so that the the idea is<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind</font>

191
00:08:59,530 --> 00:09:03,880
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> like frustrate them to kind of</font>

192
00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:06,130
influence the behavior so that they give

193
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:09,640
up or that their actions become very

194
00:09:06,130 --> 00:09:13,390
clear on the network<font color="#CCCCCC"> and so this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is kind</font>

195
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:15,220
of output from our simulations right if

196
00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:17,560
you can see at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the top of this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> surface</font>

197
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:19,780
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the payoff to the attacker a</font>

198
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:22,449
normalized payoff so when you're at one

199
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:24,910
that means the attacker has extracted

200
00:09:22,450 --> 00:09:27,310
everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> out of your system and you</font>

201
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:30,010
can see<font color="#E5E5E5"> the other</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> axes right I'm include</font>

202
00:09:27,310 --> 00:09:32,319
variables such as this commitment so how

203
00:09:30,010 --> 00:09:34,600
much<font color="#E5E5E5"> my disk am I willing to put in to</font>

204
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:37,120
inflating these files and how many

205
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:40,450
decoys am I willing to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make at the same</font>

206
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:43,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">time and you can see that we win when we</font>

207
00:09:40,450 --> 00:09:47,770
put more resources in to<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing so right</font>

208
00:09:43,330 --> 00:09:49,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">so we've effectively eliminated pay off</font>

209
00:09:47,770 --> 00:09:52,240
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the attacker</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and when it's at the</font>

210
00:09:49,570 --> 00:09:55,300
bottom and so it becomes an optimization

211
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:57,730
problem in this case this is the key

212
00:09:55,300 --> 00:10:00,459
dynamic component to our approach right

213
00:09:57,730 --> 00:10:02,650
and so there now the<font color="#E5E5E5"> analysts would they</font>

214
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:04,839
can do as well that they can supply the

215
00:10:02,650 --> 00:10:07,569
simulation with historical data right

216
00:10:04,839 --> 00:10:10,330
and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they can select up front a</font>

217
00:10:07,570 --> 00:10:12,160
threshold such that it equates to a

218
00:10:10,330 --> 00:10:14,470
certain number of alerts they're willing

219
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:16,689
<font color="#CCCCCC">to deal with every day I'm say their</font>

220
00:10:14,470 --> 00:10:18,610
their their attention right there<font color="#E5E5E5"> only</font>

221
00:10:16,690 --> 00:10:20,170
their staff is only able to deal with

222
00:10:18,610 --> 00:10:22,510
100 alert so you can figure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that out</font>

223
00:10:20,170 --> 00:10:28,150
beforehand with this optimization screen

224
00:10:22,510 --> 00:10:31,450
so a couple notes on the section<font color="#E5E5E5"> arm</font>

225
00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:33,459
something we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make clear and what</font>

226
00:10:31,450 --> 00:10:37,540
others have said is that this section is

227
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:40,750
not security through obscurity<font color="#E5E5E5"> Eugene</font>

228
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:43,719
Stafford have elaborate on you'll you'll

229
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:46,450
still finishing right<font color="#E5E5E5"> the section what</font>

230
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:49,089
what it is is planned actions that we

231
00:10:46,450 --> 00:10:50,980
take and we design into the system such

232
00:10:49,089 --> 00:10:53,050
that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of want to mislead the</font>

233
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:54,700
attacker we want to push them into a

234
00:10:53,050 --> 00:10:57,040
corner right such that they have to put

235
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:59,440
more skin in the game<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so in doing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

236
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:02,410
they they they kind of risk exposing

237
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:04,380
themselves right that's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> main idea</font>

238
00:11:02,410 --> 00:11:06,480
right unlike

239
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:09,750
to obscurity right there it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

240
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:15,030
design choice at all this is hiding your

241
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:19,290
implementation right and so I'm just

242
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:24,030
kind of two categories<font color="#E5E5E5"> we've kind of</font>

243
00:11:19,290 --> 00:11:25,709
been looking at the section there's

244
00:11:24,030 --> 00:11:27,839
deception of detection right this is

245
00:11:25,710 --> 00:11:33,210
kind of your classic honey token honey

246
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:37,050
servers honey everything right we kind

247
00:11:33,210 --> 00:11:38,670
of when we were our early research we're

248
00:11:37,050 --> 00:11:40,680
looking at the section kind of<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

249
00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:42,750
direction<font color="#E5E5E5"> right we want to direct the</font>

250
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:44,609
attackers actions right we want to give

251
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:47,670
options to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the analyst right it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind</font>

252
00:11:44,610 --> 00:11:50,070
of like a means to set up your system in

253
00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:52,530
a way that it can fight back against the

254
00:11:50,070 --> 00:12:00,420
attacker in a way kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of setting up a</font>

255
00:11:52,530 --> 00:12:03,930
minefield of sorts and so our goal on

256
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:06,750
here right again I will<font color="#E5E5E5"> say it over and</font>

257
00:12:03,930 --> 00:12:09,599
over we want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make me the attacker</font>

258
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:13,650
very visible to us and we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

259
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:15,660
deal with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the base rate fallacy as a lot</font>

260
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:17,819
of analysts will tell you today they're

261
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:21,150
just overwhelmed with false positives

262
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:25,860
and so we add a dynamic component on

263
00:12:21,150 --> 00:12:28,140
using our simulations<font color="#E5E5E5"> right the the key</font>

264
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:33,870
idea<font color="#CCCCCC"> is that you know the the network</font>

265
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:37,080
itself<font color="#E5E5E5"> your host network is a key is the</font>

266
00:12:33,870 --> 00:12:40,320
key that helps configure itself right so

267
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:43,470
is the emergent properties of your

268
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:44,940
network<font color="#E5E5E5"> like is a historical traffic</font>

269
00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:47,250
volume right it's what we use to

270
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:51,600
reconfigure yourself right so you are

271
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:54,240
always having the attacker to to can to

272
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:56,640
invest a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> energy at all times</font>

273
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:58,590
right it's never like a static thing so

274
00:12:56,640 --> 00:13:00,060
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> moving away from the static</font>

275
00:12:58,590 --> 00:13:02,460
threshold to a dynamic one and

276
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:06,569
incorporating deceptive elements as<font color="#CCCCCC"> well</font>

277
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:08,970
so now I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll transition into the</font>

278
00:13:06,570 --> 00:13:12,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">message this is where the bulk of my</font>

279
00:13:08,970 --> 00:13:17,850
work went in with michael collins and

280
00:13:12,390 --> 00:13:20,459
company so I focus a lot on

281
00:13:17,850 --> 00:13:23,610
generation of artifacts right and as

282
00:13:20,459 --> 00:13:28,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">Michael Collins like to say he enjoys</font>

283
00:13:23,610 --> 00:13:32,040
lying for fun and profit pretty much so

284
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:35,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">I used a lot of techniques from natural</font>

285
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:37,349
language processing in this and some

286
00:13:35,339 --> 00:13:41,699
techniques from malware such as taken

287
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:45,269
ography and what's the<font color="#CCCCCC"> word file header</font>

288
00:13:41,699 --> 00:13:47,099
spoofing as well so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll take you</font>

289
00:13:45,269 --> 00:13:51,329
through<font color="#E5E5E5"> the document generation first</font>

290
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:54,089

00:13:54,089 --> 00:13:58,199
of documents<font color="#E5E5E5"> right if we could kind of</font>

293
00:13:56,579 --> 00:14:00,209
look like your organization right if

294
00:13:58,199 --> 00:14:01,589
it's a medical research organization I'm

295
00:14:00,209 --> 00:14:04,500
you can probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> download of all</font>

296
00:14:01,589 --> 00:14:06,420
articles from PubMed for example the

297
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:09,029
depending on how you do it you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can even</font>

298
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:12,120
use<font color="#CCCCCC"> your own documents right because the</font>

299
00:14:09,029 --> 00:14:14,610
you'll see that the my approach is to

300
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:19,350
kind of like extract<font color="#CCCCCC"> keywords right to</font>

301
00:14:14,610 --> 00:14:20,459
make these decoys look realistic and so

302
00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:23,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">that that's what a lot of natural</font>

303
00:14:20,459 --> 00:14:25,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">language</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> processing comes in and then</font>

304
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:27,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'll show</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you some approaches to kind of</font>

305
00:14:25,170 --> 00:14:32,430
like actually assembling these these

306
00:14:27,779 --> 00:14:36,180
decoys and so again<font color="#E5E5E5"> we kind of want to</font>

307
00:14:32,430 --> 00:14:39,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">flood the system right I'm based off a</font>

308
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:41,459
number of documents you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to protect</font>

309
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:44,610
right and using<font color="#CCCCCC"> our simulation you can</font>

310
00:14:41,459 --> 00:14:47,609
get a recommended number of<font color="#E5E5E5"> equus to</font>

311
00:14:44,610 --> 00:14:52,230
make you know it has<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be big enough</font>

312
00:14:47,610 --> 00:14:53,639
such that any like random attempt at

313
00:14:52,230 --> 00:14:55,290
exultation they'll end up with a lot of

314
00:14:53,639 --> 00:15:00,089
decoys the sort of real files right

315
00:14:55,290 --> 00:15:02,310
these dollar signs here and so um a lot

316
00:15:00,089 --> 00:15:07,680
of techniques they have a wide variety

317
00:15:02,310 --> 00:15:11,729
of purposes in academia they draw from

318
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:13,859
context-free grammars or the approach

319
00:15:11,730 --> 00:15:17,610
that I kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of came up with the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Mad Libs</font>

320
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:19,709
approach there's also the<font color="#CCCCCC"> markov model</font>

321
00:15:17,610 --> 00:15:21,810
generation but i won't go into that

322
00:15:19,709 --> 00:15:26,489
<font color="#E5E5E5">today but that's a classic approach as</font>

323
00:15:21,810 --> 00:15:30,560
well so a lot of purpose is on parody or

324
00:15:26,490 --> 00:15:33,470
sometimes recently<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think</font>

325
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:35,750
the journal science did a sting

326
00:15:33,470 --> 00:15:38,120
operation on predatory journals where

327
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:40,700
they generated a lot of fake research

328
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:42,710
right and those those fake paper that

329
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:44,600
they made those that got accepted those

330
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:49,010
are the predatory journals because it

331
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:52,430
was complete nonsense and so one of our

332
00:15:49,010 --> 00:15:55,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">colleagues at the time Brian satira he</font>

333
00:15:52,430 --> 00:15:58,489
made a very critical observation on that

334
00:15:55,790 --> 00:16:00,529
document generation only<font color="#CCCCCC"> has to be good</font>

335
00:15:58,490 --> 00:16:04,670
enough<font color="#E5E5E5"> right it does not have to be a</font>

336
00:16:00,529 --> 00:16:06,980
perfect<font color="#E5E5E5"> lie because what you're trying</font>

337
00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:08,930
to fool is malware you're either trying

338
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:11,510
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> film our that's looking for key words</font>

339
00:16:08,930 --> 00:16:14,900
right you know this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> top secret what</font>

340
00:16:11,510 --> 00:16:17,750
have you or you're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to fool</font>

341
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:19,790
non-native speaker and the malware and

342
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:22,310
the non-native speaker or anyone really

343
00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:25,189
in general doesn't have enough time to

344
00:16:22,310 --> 00:16:27,170
say like<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh no this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this is garbage</font>

345
00:16:25,190 --> 00:16:28,850
right I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to bother not</font>

346
00:16:27,170 --> 00:16:31,099
accelerating this though they're usually

347
00:16:28,850 --> 00:16:32,779
worried about with minimizing their time

348
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:39,320
on the system<font color="#E5E5E5"> zipping everything up and</font>

349
00:16:32,779 --> 00:16:44,510
taking it out so yes it's so kind of key

350
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:46,940
an example<font color="#E5E5E5"> I included here draws from</font>

351
00:16:44,510 --> 00:16:49,130
this observation right there's a site

352
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:51,380
called snark<font color="#CCCCCC"> Ives versus archives</font>

353
00:16:49,130 --> 00:16:53,839
unoffending was familiar with archive

354
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:58,280
the usually a mathematical

355
00:16:53,839 --> 00:17:00,110
pre-publication um service and so<font color="#CCCCCC"> um</font>

356
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:03,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">sometimes they have very esoteric</font>

357
00:17:00,110 --> 00:17:07,849
looking titles but it's legit research

358
00:17:03,830 --> 00:17:10,130
but the you know a average person is not

359
00:17:07,849 --> 00:17:13,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> tell which one's the real</font>

360
00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:17,209
article right so the snark I've is kind

361
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:18,980
of like they'll make a nonsense journal

362
00:17:17,209 --> 00:17:21,319
title and they'll have users guess which

363
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:22,790
one's the real one let me take a second

364
00:17:21,319 --> 00:17:26,560
try to guess which one's the real one

365
00:17:22,790 --> 00:17:26,560
here which is the fake one right

366
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:34,460
this is real fake one and so on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the site</font>

367
00:17:32,270 --> 00:17:37,340
will rate you and compare you to how

368
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:40,130
other users performed<font color="#E5E5E5"> right pretty much</font>

369
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:44,480
coin flip right fifty percent thought

370
00:17:40,130 --> 00:17:47,420
that was a real one so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I did this a</font>

371
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:49,670
couple tries when I got rated as a<font color="#CCCCCC"> 9th</font>

372
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:56,720
year grad student which hopefully I

373
00:17:49,670 --> 00:18:00,830
won't end<font color="#E5E5E5"> up as one so another tool um</font>

374
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:04,280
from MIT is called<font color="#E5E5E5"> seijin and makes fake</font>

375
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:07,460
computer science journals they<font color="#CCCCCC"> also did</font>

376
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:10,280
a couple of humorous sting operations

377
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:13,400
themselves got a couple papers accepted

378
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:16,010
and even a conference at one time I'm so

379
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:18,559
this is just complete context-free

380
00:18:16,010 --> 00:18:20,780
grammar I believe these so Markov model

381
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:22,250
type things to make these<font color="#CCCCCC"> things and</font>

382
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:25,370
they'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> it complete with the graphs</font>

383
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:27,679
right it's a quick glance you see this

384
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:31,340
is response time measuring with respect

385
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:35,059
to bandwidth and bandwidth units are

386
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:38,959
decibels right so it's just this is

387
00:18:35,059 --> 00:18:46,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">nonsense but it is useful to us</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> come</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

388
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:47,480
our<font color="#E5E5E5"> approach so first first thing you</font>

389
00:18:46,010 --> 00:18:50,450
have to do is assemble your corporates

390
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:54,410
right depending<font color="#CCCCCC"> on how big your process</font>

391
00:18:50,450 --> 00:18:56,240
um you're you're you're depending on the

392
00:18:54,410 --> 00:18:58,130
system you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to implement this on</font>

393
00:18:56,240 --> 00:19:00,559
where you have to consider<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of</font>

394
00:18:58,130 --> 00:19:02,690
resources right and so when<font color="#CCCCCC"> we were</font>

395
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:06,320
setting this up we didn't have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of</font>

396
00:19:02,690 --> 00:19:08,150
resources right so I kind of had don't

397
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:12,020
like a quick corpus of documents that I

398
00:19:08,150 --> 00:19:15,980
got right<font color="#E5E5E5"> also key a key point right if</font>

399
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:18,679
you're using corpus from from Wikipedia

400
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:20,450
or whatnot it might have sensitive

401
00:19:18,679 --> 00:19:23,179
information depending on your

402
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:24,860
organization it will have classified

403
00:19:23,179 --> 00:19:27,140
documents and so you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font>

404
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:32,240
careful with something a corpus

405
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:35,870
depending on where you're working at so

406
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:39,590
here<font color="#E5E5E5"> i use wikipedia i use a curated</font>

407
00:19:35,870 --> 00:19:40,939
list of topics you'll see later actually

408
00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:43,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">use the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> list of clinical</font>

409
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:46,820
bacteria and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the goal is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to make an</font>

410
00:19:43,730 --> 00:19:49,250
article from a cat the the wikipedia

411
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:51,320
entry for cat look more like a<font color="#CCCCCC"> bacteria</font>

412
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:53,360
article i'll show you that shortly but

413
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:55,100
here are you know you can use a lot of

414
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:59,689
basic tools to assemble your corporate

415
00:19:55,100 --> 00:20:02,990
so here i use curl and it used a a very

416
00:19:59,690 --> 00:20:04,820
powerful<font color="#E5E5E5"> tool called JQ I don't know if</font>

417
00:20:02,990 --> 00:20:07,070
anyone<font color="#E5E5E5"> here is familiar with UNIX core</font>

418
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:10,639
tools such as like awk or said or

419
00:20:07,070 --> 00:20:13,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">whatnot JQ is kind of like said for JSON</font>

420
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:17,150
so you can do a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of powerful JSON</font>

421
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:19,399
processing with JQ so I get the JSON

422
00:20:17,150 --> 00:20:21,110
response from Wikipedia and you can

423
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:25,670
parse it out on with this<font color="#CCCCCC"> very powerful</font>

424
00:20:21,110 --> 00:20:28,370
language here so it's very hard to see

425
00:20:25,670 --> 00:20:31,070
here<font color="#E5E5E5"> I apologize but um you pretty much</font>

426
00:20:28,370 --> 00:20:33,770
access it<font color="#E5E5E5"> like like it were like in a</font>

427
00:20:31,070 --> 00:20:35,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">JavaScript code or Python code you use</font>

428
00:20:33,770 --> 00:20:39,650
access to project properties with dots

429
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:43,100
right on the dot query property I want

430
00:20:39,650 --> 00:20:45,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">to duck worried pages sub-object um you</font>

431
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:49,909
can do a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of fancy filter type</font>

432
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:51,830
operations such as map right<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want to</font>

433
00:20:49,910 --> 00:20:56,660
access this property for for each object

434
00:20:51,830 --> 00:20:59,179
very quick way to get started<font color="#E5E5E5"> once you</font>

435
00:20:56,660 --> 00:21:02,270
get familiar and I believe JQ has a

436
00:20:59,180 --> 00:21:04,670
sandbox site i recommend looking at I'm

437
00:21:02,270 --> 00:21:07,820
to play around<font color="#E5E5E5"> with this language right</font>

438
00:21:04,670 --> 00:21:09,560
you finally get the last element of what

439
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:12,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">I want and then there I have the the</font>

440
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:15,770
article for cat that i'll show you an

441
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:18,980
upcoming example other<font color="#E5E5E5"> things to</font>

442
00:21:15,770 --> 00:21:21,800
consider natural language processing is

443
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:23,690
not trivial depending on how realistic

444
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:26,930
you want to make your documents right

445
00:21:23,690 --> 00:21:31,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'll show you that good example is</font>

446
00:21:26,930 --> 00:21:33,320
tokenization right so this will one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

447
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:35,360
my favorite quotes<font color="#E5E5E5"> that i'll show you</font>

448
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:37,639
what it's like when you split it naively

449
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:40,159
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is more like natural language</font>

450
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:42,680
processing aware approach right if you

451
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:47,390
do just got split this is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> Python</font>

452
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:49,940
example right the more advanced approach

453
00:21:47,390 --> 00:21:51,950
to tokenizing this right will consider

454
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:54,740
the token isn't different

455
00:21:51,950 --> 00:21:58,519
right it'll split it up into is and not

456
00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:59,960
ill preserve the apostrophe it depends

457
00:21:58,519 --> 00:22:02,419
whether you want that<font color="#E5E5E5"> or not but it's</font>

458
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:07,130
something to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be aware of when generating</font>

459
00:22:02,419 --> 00:22:09,049
your artifacts music another<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing to</font>

460
00:22:07,130 --> 00:22:12,169
get rid of when you're doing a lot of

461
00:22:09,049 --> 00:22:14,629
natural<font color="#CCCCCC"> language is to get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> rid of stop</font>

462
00:22:12,169 --> 00:22:16,519
words right and you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> get on these</font>

463
00:22:14,630 --> 00:22:20,210
lists are available from different

464
00:22:16,519 --> 00:22:21,980
sources on this one's from google stop

465
00:22:20,210 --> 00:22:25,340
words are kind of words<font color="#CCCCCC"> they are very</font>

466
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:29,240
common like the and etc and they<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of</font>

467
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:32,779
interfere like extracting a mini more

468
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:34,460
meaningful signal from your corpus so

469
00:22:32,779 --> 00:22:35,779
it's kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a natural language</font>

470
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:38,360
processing thing you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to enhance</font>

471
00:22:35,779 --> 00:22:40,519
like kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> like in our case kind of</font>

472
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:43,908
like we want to get key words from a

473
00:22:40,519 --> 00:22:46,279
specific collection of documents until a

474
00:22:43,909 --> 00:22:50,690
key word is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to be the in any</font>

475
00:22:46,279 --> 00:22:53,029
any corpus pretty much just<font color="#CCCCCC"> a quick code</font>

476
00:22:50,690 --> 00:22:55,250
example of putting<font color="#E5E5E5"> it all together right</font>

477
00:22:53,029 --> 00:22:59,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> am my transformer and my tokenizer</font>

478
00:22:55,250 --> 00:23:02,299
other filters right so here<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

479
00:22:59,210 --> 00:23:04,279
constructed a quick generator that

480
00:23:02,299 --> 00:23:05,960
applies all these filters right and the

481
00:23:04,279 --> 00:23:08,659
idea here is to kind of have a more

482
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:15,320
streamlined<font color="#E5E5E5"> undo a streaming processing</font>

483
00:23:08,659 --> 00:23:18,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">num so finally can I kind of taking all</font>

484
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:20,418
that into consideration on you have your

485
00:23:18,139 --> 00:23:22,610
corpus you've applied your filters<font color="#E5E5E5"> right</font>

486
00:23:20,419 --> 00:23:26,899
you just have a bag of words pretty much

487
00:23:22,610 --> 00:23:29,629
you can use a concept<font color="#E5E5E5"> from very early</font>

488
00:23:26,899 --> 00:23:34,850
NOP<font color="#E5E5E5"> where it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the term frequency</font>

489
00:23:29,630 --> 00:23:37,519
inverse document frequency metrics from

490
00:23:34,850 --> 00:23:40,070
you apply these equations on your on

491
00:23:37,519 --> 00:23:43,490
your corpus right it will help you kind

492
00:23:40,070 --> 00:23:45,710
of rank which words are kind of more

493
00:23:43,490 --> 00:23:49,220
important with respect to a document

494
00:23:45,710 --> 00:23:52,309
corpus right it's kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of similar to</font>

495
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:55,370
Google's page rank right so which words

496
00:23:52,309 --> 00:23:57,440
are more important to whatever web pages

497
00:23:55,370 --> 00:24:00,709
right so in this case what words are

498
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:04,140
more important in your topic that in our

499
00:24:00,710 --> 00:24:06,990
case we<font color="#E5E5E5"> want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> keywords out of</font>

500
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:10,560
and so that corporates that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mentioned</font>

501
00:24:06,990 --> 00:24:12,330
earlier right it was a set of clinically

502
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:14,490
important bacteria right these are the

503
00:24:12,330 --> 00:24:18,990
terms that I got from the links i

504
00:24:14,490 --> 00:24:21,270
downloaded and so i'll show you<font color="#CCCCCC"> how this</font>

505
00:24:18,990 --> 00:24:23,400
comes into play and so on the score

506
00:24:21,270 --> 00:24:28,050
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> the higher it is the the more</font>

507
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:31,320
relevant it is to my corpus another

508
00:24:28,050 --> 00:24:34,169
important tool that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i use is called pan</font>

509
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:37,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">doc and depending on the documents that</font>

510
00:24:34,170 --> 00:24:40,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">you want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to make right you want to make</font>

511
00:24:37,290 --> 00:24:42,330
pdfs you want to make HTML you want to

512
00:24:40,290 --> 00:24:46,350
make<font color="#E5E5E5"> RTF this is a very quick and dirty</font>

513
00:24:42,330 --> 00:24:48,629
way to<font color="#CCCCCC"> go from like mark down for</font>

514
00:24:46,350 --> 00:24:51,419
example into a very like

515
00:24:48,630 --> 00:24:53,790
realistic-looking PDF very<font color="#E5E5E5"> simply you</font>

516
00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:56,130
don't use any fancy libraries or

517
00:24:53,790 --> 00:24:57,960
anything it's able<font color="#CCCCCC"> to interconvert from</font>

518
00:24:56,130 --> 00:25:02,850
a lot of formats will save you<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of</font>

519
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:06,810
time is<font color="#E5E5E5"> very powerful as well and this</font>

520
00:25:02,850 --> 00:25:08,459
kind of examples marked down right and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

521
00:25:06,810 --> 00:25:11,700
kind of like a preview pane is using the

522
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:13,140
atom editor not sure if they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> using</font>

523
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:15,210
pan back behind the scenes that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

524
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:20,850
wouldn't be surprised<font color="#CCCCCC"> to give you the</font>

525
00:25:15,210 --> 00:25:23,610
preview so here I'll introduce the

526
00:25:20,850 --> 00:25:26,730
approach<font color="#E5E5E5"> I develop call them it's for</font>

527
00:25:23,610 --> 00:25:28,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">you it's just mad libs pretty much I'll</font>

528
00:25:26,730 --> 00:25:30,870
walk you through it but at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the end of</font>

529
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:32,490
the day it's just mad libs but it kind

530
00:25:30,870 --> 00:25:34,469
of plays off the idea that it just has

531
00:25:32,490 --> 00:25:40,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">to look good enough my in my document</font>

532
00:25:34,470 --> 00:25:42,780
take a document and then you're you're

533
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:44,129
you're actually let me step back<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

534
00:25:42,780 --> 00:25:46,139
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take my corpus i'm going to</font>

535
00:25:44,130 --> 00:25:48,330
extract all the keywords and we're going

536
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:51,840
to map all<font color="#CCCCCC"> the parts</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> speech that are</font>

537
00:25:48,330 --> 00:25:53,280
present in<font color="#CCCCCC"> that corpus</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm going to map</font>

538
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:55,770
them to the list of words that they

539
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:58,649
correspond to and the reason is i'm

540
00:25:55,770 --> 00:26:00,720
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to visit</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> every word in like a in a</font>

00:25:58,650 --> 00:26:03,600
template document<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm going to</font>

probabilistically<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a flip a coin like</font>

543
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:09,090
is it on my threshold i'm going to say

544
00:26:07,350 --> 00:26:12,330
what part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of speech is it and they're</font>

545
00:26:09,090 --> 00:26:15,030
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> randomly take a list of words</font>

546
00:26:12,330 --> 00:26:16,290
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> my mapping and replace it with the</font>

547
00:26:15,030 --> 00:26:17,750
same part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of speech so I'm replacing</font>

548
00:26:16,290 --> 00:26:21,020
words for my template

549
00:26:17,750 --> 00:26:25,250
basic apart of speech from my<font color="#E5E5E5"> keywords</font>

00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:28,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">it it's kind</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a mapping example</font>

right all<font color="#E5E5E5"> my nouns from my corpus this</font>

552
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:34,880
is a small subset all my adverts on my

553
00:26:31,010 --> 00:26:37,129
verbs these are this is my my keywords

<font color="#E5E5E5">Mac by pirates speech i will use to</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">replace words in my template so here's</font>

556
00:26:40,670 --> 00:26:47,000
an example this is the wikipedia entry

557
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:49,220
for cats I've highlighted the parts that

558
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:51,620
got replaced<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll show you in the next</font>

559
00:26:49,220 --> 00:26:53,990
slide what it looks like right in the

560
00:26:51,620 --> 00:26:57,320
green those are<font color="#E5E5E5"> the words that got</font>

561
00:26:53,990 --> 00:26:59,330
replaced in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> yellow those were a</font>

562
00:26:57,320 --> 00:27:03,919
sentence is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I thought</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we're kind of</font>

563
00:26:59,330 --> 00:27:09,919
funny-looking first thing to note is

564
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:11,840
that the grammar the capitalization was

565
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:13,850
not preserved I didn't put effort into

566
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:16,070
doing that but that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> something that you</font>

567
00:27:13,850 --> 00:27:18,169
can consider<font color="#CCCCCC"> it in your approach if you</font>

568
00:27:16,070 --> 00:27:19,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">want to do something like this you see</font>

569
00:27:18,170 --> 00:27:22,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">there there's space between the commas</font>

570
00:27:19,910 --> 00:27:24,380
what have you that's how<font color="#E5E5E5"> it turned out</font>

571
00:27:22,010 --> 00:27:27,650
in my implementation when you see right

572
00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:31,010
latin name virulent<font color="#CCCCCC"> casas right</font>

573
00:27:27,650 --> 00:27:33,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">obviously a red flag there there's no</font>

574
00:27:31,010 --> 00:27:35,870
need to anthrax them they're similar in

575
00:27:33,710 --> 00:27:37,250
anatomy to other microbes and their

576
00:27:35,870 --> 00:27:39,530
teeth are adapted to killing small

577
00:27:37,250 --> 00:27:42,650
bacterium right this is complete

578
00:27:39,530 --> 00:27:46,220
nonsense but I've made it in a tf-idf

579
00:27:42,650 --> 00:27:52,370
kind of like perspective<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's more</font>

580
00:27:46,220 --> 00:27:55,100
bacterial sounding right very simple

581
00:27:52,370 --> 00:27:56,750
very effective so this will be<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably</font>

582
00:27:55,100 --> 00:28:00,330
very good against<font color="#E5E5E5"> the malware this is</font>

583
00:27:56,750 --> 00:28:03,690
looking for<font color="#E5E5E5"> keywords</font>

584
00:28:00,330 --> 00:28:07,678
this this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is leveraging the sizing tool</font>

585
00:28:03,690 --> 00:28:10,559
itself on you can get the hydrogen code

586
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:16,110
from github it's a set of Perl scripts

587
00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:19,620
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> GNU plot scripts not very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hard to</font>

588
00:28:16,110 --> 00:28:22,080
modify or execute it will give you a

589
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:25,229
postscript file as output or raw

590
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:29,250
lightech you can give<font color="#E5E5E5"> it to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> panda he'll</font>

592
00:28:29,250 --> 00:28:37,110
what I did I took one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> their source</font>

593
00:28:33,210 --> 00:28:40,289
files<font color="#E5E5E5"> ISM they is part of their free</font>

594
00:28:37,110 --> 00:28:43,620
grammar<font color="#CCCCCC"> setup right they have a list</font>

595
00:28:40,289 --> 00:28:46,379
mapping like you know this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is my list of</font>

596
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:48,899
science buzz words that are plural nouns

597
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:51,870
is my buzz words that are nouns these

598
00:28:48,899 --> 00:28:54,539
are my my my adjectives are very science

599
00:28:51,870 --> 00:28:57,899
he's hounding you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm so what I did</font>

600
00:28:54,539 --> 00:29:03,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">was I kind of inserted key points here</font>

601
00:28:57,899 --> 00:29:05,639
<font color="#CCCCCC">too to have my my script i have another</font>

602
00:29:03,330 --> 00:29:07,889
script that will look for these tags and

603
00:29:05,639 --> 00:29:10,019
replace it with keywords that correspond

604
00:29:07,889 --> 00:29:13,289
<font color="#CCCCCC">to the part of speech and so that's a</font>

605
00:29:10,019 --> 00:29:16,320
way that I kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of hacks hydrogen in a</font>

606
00:29:13,289 --> 00:29:17,669
way to kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> like have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it use my words</font>

607
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:23,760
instead of their words that it comes

608
00:29:17,669 --> 00:29:26,130
with so I then regenerated I not region

609
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:29,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">I generated a one of their computer</font>

610
00:29:26,130 --> 00:29:32,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">science articles but this time it has</font>

611
00:29:29,669 --> 00:29:34,710
more bacterial more and more words<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

612
00:29:32,309 --> 00:29:37,440
come from the bacterial articles right

613
00:29:34,710 --> 00:29:42,419
the green again those<font color="#CCCCCC"> are words that got</font>

614
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:45,659
replaced right so they're unified

615
00:29:42,419 --> 00:29:48,059
flexible theory have led to<font color="#CCCCCC"> many edema</font>

616
00:29:45,659 --> 00:29:52,049
advances including antibiotics and

617
00:29:48,059 --> 00:29:54,059
<font color="#E5E5E5">clumps right you know as a that's the</font>

618
00:29:52,049 --> 00:29:58,470
computer science papers<font color="#E5E5E5"> I got back</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> T</font>

619
00:29:54,059 --> 00:29:59,789
realized I guess you<font color="#CCCCCC"> could say so that's</font>

620
00:29:58,470 --> 00:30:01,470
another approach you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can use if you</font>

621
00:29:59,789 --> 00:30:02,519
don't want these mad mad libs you want

622
00:30:01,470 --> 00:30:09,570
to use<font color="#E5E5E5"> them more kind of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out-of-the-box</font>

623
00:30:02,519 --> 00:30:13,020
approach so we we take these on these

624
00:30:09,570 --> 00:30:21,659
freshly generated decoyed documents and

625
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:24,450
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> can you do with them</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> now great you</font>

626
00:30:21,660 --> 00:30:28,620
can take<font color="#E5E5E5"> news documents right you can</font>

627
00:30:24,450 --> 00:30:30,990
literally file system with them or you

628
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:34,080
can take these documents and you can

629
00:30:30,990 --> 00:30:37,980
hide the files<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to protect</font>

630
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:40,889
within their alternate data stream near

631
00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:44,370
the technique borrowed from malware this

632
00:30:40,890 --> 00:30:48,720
is something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that malware actually uses</font>

633
00:30:44,370 --> 00:30:51,030
to hide from antivirus and so this this

634
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:54,810
example here<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's specific to ntfs</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

635
00:30:51,030 --> 00:31:00,450
have to point out is<font color="#CCCCCC"> 80 80 80 s is</font>

636
00:30:54,810 --> 00:31:04,740
technically a a fork<font color="#CCCCCC"> Apple has this as</font>

637
00:31:00,450 --> 00:31:07,590
well on resource<font color="#E5E5E5"> Forks though I'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

638
00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:10,500
too sure about unix-like systems<font color="#CCCCCC"> I know</font>

639
00:31:07,590 --> 00:31:13,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">AB both Apple and Microsoft implement</font>

640
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:17,130
something like this and so when you're

641
00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:18,840
dealing with<font color="#CCCCCC"> ABS when I was actually</font>

642
00:31:17,130 --> 00:31:20,760
researching it what would they were in

643
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:23,669
the first place I similar an article<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

644
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:28,260
the first thing it says is it is a data

645
00:31:23,670 --> 00:31:30,300
stream that is alternate I'll after that

646
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:31,950
but that's the best<font color="#E5E5E5"> way to describe it</font>

647
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:35,399
because when you're dealing with with an

648
00:31:31,950 --> 00:31:38,250
NTSF file<font color="#E5E5E5"> there the data that you're</font>

649
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:44,160
accessing or messing with is the unnamed

650
00:31:38,250 --> 00:31:45,570
the unnamed stream right and so on the

651
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:49,290
command line this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is how you would</font>

652
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:51,659
access it for<font color="#E5E5E5"> example that's where all</font>

653
00:31:49,290 --> 00:31:54,570
the all the actual data goes to and you

654
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:59,820
can put as many streams as you want on

655
00:31:54,570 --> 00:32:03,300
these files just give<font color="#E5E5E5"> it a name</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and just</font>

656
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:05,790
do your your regular old boss batch

657
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:09,030
commands or if you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> PowerShell</font>

658
00:32:05,790 --> 00:32:11,280
there's a set of command lit that gives

659
00:32:09,030 --> 00:32:14,340
you a gang of a better interface for

660
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:16,680
that offense your interface I believe

661
00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:20,280
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> called streams exe that you can get</font>

662
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:23,490
from Microsoft to expose from what ad s

663
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:26,460
is are present on the file

664
00:32:23,490 --> 00:32:30,870
but with<font color="#CCCCCC"> respect to our approach if we</font>

665
00:32:26,460 --> 00:32:34,559
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> hide files right at the top here</font>

666
00:32:30,870 --> 00:32:36,809
I'm echoing a string to a document

667
00:32:34,559 --> 00:32:40,590
creating a document that has that text

668
00:32:36,809 --> 00:32:44,129
its size 19 bites I'm making another

669
00:32:40,590 --> 00:32:48,899
file it's a bigger string of text it's

670
00:32:44,130 --> 00:32:51,570
45 bites but now I'm taking that that

671
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:54,330
whole document that second document I'm

672
00:32:51,570 --> 00:32:58,020
putting it in an ADF stream of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the first</font>

673
00:32:54,330 --> 00:33:02,070
one and what do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you see here</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> same</font>

674
00:32:58,020 --> 00:33:03,840
size as it was originally the user is

675
00:33:02,070 --> 00:33:06,780
completely unaware<font color="#CCCCCC"> of how big that</font>

676
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:08,699
document is you can play as much you can

677
00:33:06,780 --> 00:33:11,610
put gigabytes of information<font color="#CCCCCC"> in 80's</font>

678
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:13,920
stream and you'll be unaware of it and

679
00:33:11,610 --> 00:33:16,139
you think<font color="#E5E5E5"> why would you want this well</font>

680
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:18,450
there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of each use cases but</font>

681
00:33:16,140 --> 00:33:20,250
there's something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that people get get</font>

682
00:33:18,450 --> 00:33:23,100
scared<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a lot because again it's what</font>

683
00:33:20,250 --> 00:33:26,670
malware leverage is a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> times any</font>

684
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:28,949
process that is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a d/s unaware right it's</font>

685
00:33:26,670 --> 00:33:32,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">not going to know if its existence and</font>

686
00:33:28,950 --> 00:33:36,150
so this gives us another defensive

687
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:38,670
advantage right another red flag that

688
00:33:36,150 --> 00:33:41,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">you can raise this you know any typical</font>

689
00:33:38,670 --> 00:33:43,559
user that's poking around in an 80s

690
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:46,080
there's a huge red flag for example

691
00:33:43,559 --> 00:33:48,899
<font color="#CCCCCC">right well what do they know to to look</font>

692
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:50,879
around there right so it feels like an

693
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:52,770
attacker looking around 80 s on<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

694
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:55,800
system right you know that's immediate

695
00:33:52,770 --> 00:33:58,650
and cause for concern another defensive

696
00:33:55,800 --> 00:34:01,409
advantage that it gives you any time<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

697
00:33:58,650 --> 00:34:04,830
copy over and CSS file to another file

698
00:34:01,410 --> 00:34:08,460
system idiots is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> transferred another</font>

699
00:34:04,830 --> 00:34:10,918
thing on earth is<font color="#CCCCCC"> fence you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> when</font>

700
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:14,070
you zip up your files is if it's not

701
00:34:10,918 --> 00:34:16,199
going to preserve<font color="#E5E5E5"> abs its not 80s or if</font>

702
00:34:14,070 --> 00:34:19,560
you email it that's another idiot

703
00:34:16,199 --> 00:34:21,418
unaware thing right so you have all

704
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:22,889
these layers would essentially if you if

705
00:34:21,418 --> 00:34:24,569
you go through this approach it is

706
00:34:22,889 --> 00:34:28,740
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we played around with a</font>

707
00:34:24,570 --> 00:34:30,510
lot well we we serve work to do with but

708
00:34:28,739 --> 00:34:32,819
<font color="#CCCCCC">um you can definitely kind of set up a</font>

709
00:34:30,510 --> 00:34:35,669
file system of types just messing around

710
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:36,899
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> abs keeping your ear</font>

711
00:34:35,668 --> 00:34:43,529
protected files in these locations

712
00:34:36,899 --> 00:34:45,659
another thing we played around with this

713
00:34:43,530 --> 00:34:48,869
kind of goes back<font color="#E5E5E5"> to when I mentioned</font>

714
00:34:45,659 --> 00:34:51,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">user friendliness right can I use</font>

715
00:34:48,869 --> 00:34:54,210
steganography in a way to kind of have

716
00:34:51,989 --> 00:34:57,359
the user unaware of all this junk<font color="#CCCCCC"> data</font>

717
00:34:54,210 --> 00:35:02,250
I'm putting into these these files to to

718
00:34:57,359 --> 00:35:05,250
protect<font color="#E5E5E5"> them the idea was Open Office</font>

719
00:35:02,250 --> 00:35:07,950
documents they're all zip files by the

720
00:35:05,250 --> 00:35:10,829
definition if you take care<font color="#CCCCCC"> of your zip</font>

721
00:35:07,950 --> 00:35:13,919
file I mean you take your dollar your

722
00:35:10,829 --> 00:35:15,569
microsoft office document your your word

723
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:17,910
document your Excel your PowerPoint<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

724
00:35:15,569 --> 00:35:20,670
put a dot zip at the end you can unzip

725
00:35:17,910 --> 00:35:26,700
it and look at all all the<font color="#CCCCCC"> XML goodies</font>

726
00:35:20,670 --> 00:35:31,319
it has inside so i thought i can use

727
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:36,180
file header spoofing this isn't anything

728
00:35:31,319 --> 00:35:39,960
new you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can take the central directory</font>

729
00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:43,470
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the zip file and simply delete it and</font>

730
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:47,069
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're unzipped tool right say I take</font>

731
00:35:43,470 --> 00:35:49,200
file entry to hear<font color="#E5E5E5"> I actually leave it</font>

732
00:35:47,069 --> 00:35:52,380
intact in the local file header right

733
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:55,049
and here you have the actual meat of the

734
00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:56,490
data that's compressed this was

735
00:35:55,049 --> 00:35:59,099
directory listing i delete that

736
00:35:56,490 --> 00:36:01,348
directory listing right i unzip it it's

737
00:35:59,099 --> 00:36:02,490
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be unzipped right we're</font>

738
00:36:01,349 --> 00:36:05,130
still going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to remain in the zip</font>

739
00:36:02,490 --> 00:36:08,549
document but it will not be exploded<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

740
00:36:05,130 --> 00:36:10,829
thought<font color="#CCCCCC"> I could fool Microsoft Word in</font>

741
00:36:08,549 --> 00:36:14,040
this way but that<font color="#E5E5E5"> ended up being</font>

742
00:36:10,829 --> 00:36:16,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">unproductive but I kind</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of still want to</font>

743
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:18,000
talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this because it all sort of</font>

744
00:36:16,230 --> 00:36:22,140
someone else might find a good way<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

745
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:26,099
this or not<font color="#E5E5E5"> this so I thought it's still</font>

746
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:28,950
variable to talk about so basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

747
00:36:26,099 --> 00:36:33,240
the it's very<font color="#E5E5E5"> simple to do this right</font>

748
00:36:28,950 --> 00:36:35,490
for each directory header listing right

749
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:40,169
you know if this is one of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> things i</font>

750
00:36:35,490 --> 00:36:46,229
want to to hide from a zip format aware

751
00:36:40,170 --> 00:36:47,630
tool area to calculate how big it's

752
00:36:46,230 --> 00:36:51,890
entries are in

753
00:36:47,630 --> 00:36:53,900
headers right because<font color="#CCCCCC"> if I don't resize</font>

754
00:36:51,890 --> 00:36:56,060
it appropriately it's going to complain

755
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:59,180
answers<font color="#E5E5E5"> I kind of this kind of like</font>

756
00:36:56,060 --> 00:37:01,009
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> through the header entries and</font>

757
00:36:59,180 --> 00:37:03,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">making sure that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of clean up</font>

758
00:37:01,010 --> 00:37:05,300
afterwards what<font color="#CCCCCC"> what I'm trying to</font>

759
00:37:03,380 --> 00:37:09,650
delete and one when i go to delete these

760
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:12,080
entries in the directory listing so kind

761
00:37:09,650 --> 00:37:15,620
of a schematic of of what the central

762
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:17,870
directory file listing looks like you

763
00:37:15,620 --> 00:37:19,609
can see that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the associate are the</font>

764
00:37:17,870 --> 00:37:22,759
bottom three entries you have to be

765
00:37:19,610 --> 00:37:26,390
careful with everything else will be

766
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:27,980
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the same size but you have to</font>

767
00:37:26,390 --> 00:37:31,759
kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of account for how big the file</font>

768
00:37:27,980 --> 00:37:33,380
name is<font color="#E5E5E5"> for this listing because when</font>

769
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:35,510
you go to truncate your file you have to

770
00:37:33,380 --> 00:37:38,390
make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's there's no junk data at</font>

771
00:37:35,510 --> 00:37:42,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">the end or is it or word will complain</font>

772
00:37:38,390 --> 00:37:44,629
immediately the same potential and the

773
00:37:42,290 --> 00:37:46,520
central directory listing right this

774
00:37:44,630 --> 00:37:49,010
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of like the last header and the zip</font>

775
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:51,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">I believe and so this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is where</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

776
00:37:49,010 --> 00:37:53,420
update or and you when you there's where

777
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:55,550
you lie about<font color="#E5E5E5"> how many things I have in</font>

778
00:37:53,420 --> 00:38:01,010
my zip file this kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> like that the</font>

779
00:37:55,550 --> 00:38:04,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">last piece to consider so this example</font>

780
00:38:01,010 --> 00:38:09,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">of my second ography tool in action</font>

781
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:11,660
there's kind of a a toy example but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

782
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:15,650
taking the actual core this is on

783
00:38:11,660 --> 00:38:16,970
running the unzip dash<font color="#CCCCCC"> L command I'll</font>

784
00:38:15,650 --> 00:38:18,620
just give you a listing of everything in

785
00:38:16,970 --> 00:38:20,959
your zip file<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's a listing of</font>

786
00:38:18,620 --> 00:38:24,410
everything in a word document and the

787
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:26,030
document<font color="#E5E5E5"> XML that's where all my all my</font>

788
00:38:24,410 --> 00:38:31,339
words are right<font color="#CCCCCC"> there that's where my</font>

789
00:38:26,030 --> 00:38:34,160
text is so what I did<font color="#E5E5E5"> here I said I want</font>

790
00:38:31,340 --> 00:38:38,810
to hide this<font color="#E5E5E5"> document from a simple</font>

791
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:41,990
where process such as unzip highlighted

792
00:38:38,810 --> 00:38:44,750
the file size 10 kilobytes here it's

793
00:38:41,990 --> 00:38:47,270
saying there's 14 files after running

794
00:38:44,750 --> 00:38:49,550
the command you<font color="#CCCCCC"> see the file size</font>

795
00:38:47,270 --> 00:38:51,830
remains unchanged because all I'm saying

796
00:38:49,550 --> 00:38:53,450
is this file is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> here even though it</font>

797
00:38:51,830 --> 00:38:56,270
is so that's what it<font color="#E5E5E5"> should</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> look like</font>

798
00:38:53,450 --> 00:39:00,020
and it's giving me 13 files are here so

799
00:38:56,270 --> 00:39:00,600
this worked we try to open word in this

800
00:39:00,020 --> 00:39:01,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">example</font>

801
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:04,980
not<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> work obviously because I'm</font>

802
00:39:01,770 --> 00:39:07,500
hiding<font color="#E5E5E5"> document xml but if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> trying</font>

803
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:11,250
to hide another payload in here I think

804
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:14,640
word still freaked out for me on both

805
00:39:11,250 --> 00:39:18,180
mac and<font color="#E5E5E5"> windows so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i went another route</font>

806
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:20,640
for that which i can mention later on

807
00:39:18,180 --> 00:39:23,339
here's what it looks like if you

808
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:25,920
actually delete document<font color="#CCCCCC"> arsenal see the</font>

809
00:39:23,340 --> 00:39:27,660
file size<font color="#E5E5E5"> is different i went from Thank</font>

810
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:34,020
You Lyrics to eight point four kilobytes

811
00:39:27,660 --> 00:39:38,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">just for reference and so what we</font>

812
00:39:34,020 --> 00:39:43,320
actually did to inflate files we made a

813
00:39:38,850 --> 00:39:46,770
random entry in the OpenOffice document

814
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:51,210
we just pump it full of random bytes

815
00:39:46,770 --> 00:39:55,230
that are uncompressed able and word you

816
00:39:51,210 --> 00:39:59,940
can try this on either Mac or Windows

817
00:39:55,230 --> 00:40:02,580
make a random entry in<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the OpenOffice</font>

818
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:07,230
document fill it with whatever data you

819
00:40:02,580 --> 00:40:10,049
want I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't mp3 is whatever zip it back</font>

820
00:40:07,230 --> 00:40:15,570
up<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then open it which word and it</font>

821
00:40:10,050 --> 00:40:18,570
should<font color="#E5E5E5"> work just fine for you only the</font>

822
00:40:15,570 --> 00:40:21,450
thing we're having trouble<font color="#CCCCCC"> with now when</font>

823
00:40:18,570 --> 00:40:24,240
we were researching this is that

824
00:40:21,450 --> 00:40:27,390
actually you save a document and you had

825
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:29,700
a payload in there it will get rid<font color="#CCCCCC"> of it</font>

826
00:40:27,390 --> 00:40:32,580
after the fact but it<font color="#E5E5E5"> won't complain</font>

827
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:34,770
when you open it<font color="#E5E5E5"> for whatever reason</font>

828
00:40:32,580 --> 00:40:39,930
there's something<font color="#CCCCCC"> to think about their</font>

829
00:40:34,770 --> 00:40:45,509
kind of strange behavior so this kind of

830
00:40:39,930 --> 00:40:48,419
that that's kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of like the the core</font>

831
00:40:45,510 --> 00:40:51,330
ideas that our approach take and kind of

832
00:40:48,420 --> 00:40:55,260
assembles together right if a dynamic

833
00:40:51,330 --> 00:40:58,080
component where we simulate how many

834
00:40:55,260 --> 00:41:02,010
base based on our resources<font color="#E5E5E5"> right how</font>

835
00:40:58,080 --> 00:41:06,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">much we're willing to invest to take the</font>

836
00:41:02,010 --> 00:41:07,860
the payoff to try to minimize attacker

837
00:41:06,030 --> 00:41:10,800
payoff right how much<font color="#CCCCCC"> disk space</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

838
00:41:07,860 --> 00:41:12,660
willing to commit so so based on those

839
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:14,470
questions right you can get an answer

840
00:41:12,660 --> 00:41:16,330
right this is how<font color="#CCCCCC"> many decoys yes</font>

841
00:41:14,470 --> 00:41:20,709
make this is how big you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to make</font>

842
00:41:16,330 --> 00:41:22,750
them in our scheme so kind of putting

843
00:41:20,710 --> 00:41:26,170
that all together right you can end up

844
00:41:22,750 --> 00:41:29,140
with a<font color="#E5E5E5"> file system right we kind of like</font>

845
00:41:26,170 --> 00:41:31,180
the list<font color="#E5E5E5"> of real files and decoys that</font>

846
00:41:29,140 --> 00:41:33,190
we want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> protect in particular right</font>

847
00:41:31,180 --> 00:41:38,410
we kind of like term that the minefield

848
00:41:33,190 --> 00:41:40,720
we have a process<font color="#E5E5E5"> that monitors where we</font>

849
00:41:38,410 --> 00:41:43,299
call this troop our approach by the way

850
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:45,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">because we call these files on since</font>

851
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:47,890
they grow rapidly under the right

852
00:41:45,940 --> 00:41:50,349
conditions right we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can call those</font>

853
00:41:47,890 --> 00:41:52,359
mushroom files and then troop is the

854
00:41:50,349 --> 00:41:54,490
collective noun for mushrooms by the way

855
00:41:52,359 --> 00:41:56,920
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> if I kind of like the troop approach</font>

856
00:41:54,490 --> 00:41:58,959
right oh we can't go in today we

857
00:41:56,920 --> 00:42:02,380
mentioned<font color="#CCCCCC"> that as well an hour RSA talk</font>

858
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:03,849
basically yeah that we have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> dynamic</font>

859
00:42:02,380 --> 00:42:05,950
system that leverages love the

860
00:42:03,849 --> 00:42:08,590
techniques from<font color="#E5E5E5"> deception and malware</font>

861
00:42:05,950 --> 00:42:10,720
you have a<font color="#CCCCCC"> susan that reconfigures</font>

862
00:42:08,590 --> 00:42:12,970
itself dynamically to kind of keep the

863
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:14,770
attacker on their toes have them put a

864
00:42:12,970 --> 00:42:16,990
lot of skin in the game make their

865
00:42:14,770 --> 00:42:20,560
actions<font color="#E5E5E5"> very visible to us and limit</font>

866
00:42:16,990 --> 00:42:25,209
their<font color="#CCCCCC"> payoffs and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so the next step we</font>

867
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:28,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">are actively trying to set up a</font>

868
00:42:25,210 --> 00:42:31,420
community in this<font color="#E5E5E5"> research area you can</font>

869
00:42:28,660 --> 00:42:34,839
visit<font color="#E5E5E5"> our website at dynamic defenses</font>

870
00:42:31,420 --> 00:42:37,750
org we have a list of publications there

871
00:42:34,839 --> 00:42:41,410
that's relevant to<font color="#CCCCCC"> our research we</font>

872
00:42:37,750 --> 00:42:46,420
invite you to<font color="#CCCCCC"> join still a lot of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> work</font>

873
00:42:41,410 --> 00:42:48,098
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do in this area it's um very simple</font>

874
00:42:46,420 --> 00:42:50,290
approach very effective and we're very

875
00:42:48,099 --> 00:42:54,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">excited about it and we invite you to</font>

876
00:42:50,290 --> 00:42:54,060
join<font color="#E5E5E5"> us thank you very much</font>

877
00:42:56,680 --> 00:43:17,410
yes so that's probably more I i would

878
00:43:13,450 --> 00:43:21,040
guess that regex more involved<font color="#E5E5E5"> in that I</font>

879
00:43:17,410 --> 00:43:23,230
believe I i only<font color="#E5E5E5"> think guess because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

880
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:26,319
had been a two years since i had worked

881
00:43:23,230 --> 00:43:31,720
on the child exploitation stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

882
00:43:26,319 --> 00:43:33,640
believe they have actually done work in

883
00:43:31,720 --> 00:43:37,359
actual investigations they have actually

884
00:43:33,640 --> 00:43:41,319
<font color="#CCCCCC">broken up rings and help people be</font>

885
00:43:37,359 --> 00:43:43,869
prosecuted for<font color="#CCCCCC"> that so for exploitation</font>

886
00:43:41,319 --> 00:43:46,829
yeah yeah exultation we have not been

887
00:43:43,869 --> 00:43:46,829
involved in those cases

888
00:43:48,610 --> 00:44:01,330
I i would think that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> common</font>

889
00:43:59,020 --> 00:44:05,470
because you don't want to have a big

890
00:44:01,330 --> 00:44:07,480
spike in network traffic you want to lay

891
00:44:05,470 --> 00:44:09,580
low<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know what I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mean you don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want</font>

892
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:12,520
to trigger any any thresholds here

893
00:44:09,580 --> 00:44:14,620
that's part of the reason<font color="#CCCCCC"> why we use</font>

894
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:17,140
inflation with uncompressed able<font color="#E5E5E5"> bikes</font>

895
00:44:14,620 --> 00:44:19,150
because by definition random data is

896
00:44:17,140 --> 00:44:21,279
uncompressed able so when they try to

897
00:44:19,150 --> 00:44:24,580
zip something up it's not going to be

898
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:27,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">zipped right you know a sample bites</font>

899
00:44:24,580 --> 00:44:29,080
from dev random but then to a farm<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

900
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:31,810
zip it up it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be the same file</font>

901
00:44:29,080 --> 00:44:34,600
size as uncompressed so when they try to

902
00:44:31,810 --> 00:44:37,390
grab as many documents as possible right

903
00:44:34,600 --> 00:44:40,330
through some automated malware you know

904
00:44:37,390 --> 00:44:42,460
it's going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be a big big spike so fake</font>

905
00:44:40,330 --> 00:44:49,480
data being transferred over the network

906
00:44:42,460 --> 00:44:51,610
yes one of the big<font color="#CCCCCC"> challenges that if in</font>

907
00:44:49,480 --> 00:44:56,140
any way<font color="#CCCCCC"> shape or form your solution</font>

908
00:44:51,610 --> 00:44:58,720
fingerprint<font color="#E5E5E5"> deception methodology burn</font>

909
00:44:56,140 --> 00:45:01,720
and it's burned<font color="#E5E5E5"> so you figure out a way</font>

910
00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:03,910
and creating use them

911
00:45:01,720 --> 00:45:07,000
one of my questions will be<font color="#E5E5E5"> in that cave</font>

912
00:45:03,910 --> 00:45:11,140
in terms of what you've shown here I

913
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:14,859
didn't see any changes<font color="#E5E5E5"> were metadata to</font>

914
00:45:11,140 --> 00:45:19,029
the file to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be the files are created</font>

915
00:45:14,859 --> 00:45:22,690
with an author so a really good bad guy

916
00:45:19,030 --> 00:45:25,180
during their enumeration will go and

917
00:45:22,690 --> 00:45:27,099
<font color="#E5E5E5">look in speed that these aren't all</font>

918
00:45:25,180 --> 00:45:29,710
clouds created on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the same thing and</font>

919
00:45:27,099 --> 00:45:32,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">therefore not actually a planted</font>

920
00:45:29,710 --> 00:45:39,190
anything for litter in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> environment</font>

921
00:45:32,140 --> 00:45:42,009
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have done part of this kind of work</font>

922
00:45:39,190 --> 00:45:46,300
for the future that include<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or that</font>

923
00:45:42,010 --> 00:45:49,180
yeah at the point is not built in I'm

924
00:45:46,300 --> 00:45:52,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure if Michael had that in mind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

925
00:45:49,180 --> 00:45:53,919
the moment it's all<font color="#E5E5E5"> very early research</font>

926
00:45:52,330 --> 00:45:56,020
at the moment but those are very<font color="#E5E5E5"> good</font>

927
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:58,030
points and those<font color="#CCCCCC"> are something that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

928
00:45:56,020 --> 00:46:00,940
can definitely consider in our future

929
00:45:58,030 --> 00:46:03,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">design and our next</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> work and definitely</font>

930
00:46:00,940 --> 00:46:07,119
spoofing file creation dates and all

931
00:46:03,460 --> 00:46:10,900
that it's definitely<font color="#CCCCCC"> a good Avenue to go</font>

932
00:46:07,119 --> 00:46:13,780
down for this research again like

933
00:46:10,900 --> 00:46:16,060
another like you know our point here we

934
00:46:13,780 --> 00:46:18,010
want to assemble a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> different</font>

935
00:46:16,060 --> 00:46:22,150
techniques right we kind of want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make</font>

936
00:46:18,010 --> 00:46:24,130
a framework in a sense that you can take

937
00:46:22,150 --> 00:46:25,930
our dynamic component and just put in

938
00:46:24,130 --> 00:46:28,570
kind of like your own<font color="#CCCCCC"> plug-in in a way</font>

939
00:46:25,930 --> 00:46:31,200
you know what I mean they add more

940
00:46:28,570 --> 00:46:31,200
layers of deception

941
00:46:33,460 --> 00:46:40,720
all right any more questions it's not

942
00:46:37,869 --> 00:46:43,619
yes feel free to contact us and please
